Unfortunately, they keep trying the same strategy as before.  Rush to Kyiv and try to take the city.  Becuase that was Putin brilliant idea and any failure is a result of underlings not being capable enough to preform the task.  Therefore, the attempt to conduct the same strategy only the try the flood technique.

As for the mass convoys.  The lack effective counter to the Ukraine armed UAS strikes.  It hardly shows up on radar, when it does, the electronic warfare package is capable of jamming radar lock.  So it's 1943 night-witch strategy all over again.  
So the theory is, mass the troop formations, when you hear the flying loan mower, shoot it down. Only I doubt they have trained for such events.  So they are still learning.  Those who do master that skill?

Well to bad, the NATO support Kyiv defenders will be given plenty of intelligence to the Russian troop movements and how to counter. They brave soldiers who mastered defending there convoy will soon have to master urban warfare against Kyiv.  
The very Ukraine army defenders of the city that have been battling for five days and consistently preparing, improve, and successfully defending the city.   Such experience should be rendered useless before the might of Putin plan.  Becuase Putin knows better.

Switzerland At the time didn't allow states to use Swiss banks for finance (Neither allied nor Nazi) (none allowed) 
On the private side it allowed all civilians foreigners access to Swiss banking. (all allowed) 
But they also did shoot down planes on both sides when they breached Swiss airspace (none allowed) 

Neutrality in foreign policy is complicated. Not always easy but it's has proven to be most stable. As private citizens of course most Swiss hated the Nazis. So neutrality is only on governmental/diplomatic/foreign policy level. 

Switzerland allowed Allies as well as Nazis to use their land for Humanitarian issues: treatment of wounded, Civilian shelter, Neutral ground for diplomacy.

Swiss banking also was helpful for many refugees fleeing despots and authoritarian, safety for the savings of millions of everyday people, especially  before/during WWI/WWII.
From allied perspective at the time it was described as the safe haven for millions of civilians fleeing war, persecution and destruction. Something not possible without neutrality. 

Neutrality allows freedom of expression which also has a 700 year history. Many thinkers, philosophs, reformers etc. persecuted by their States found exile/asylum in Switzerland, because it was neutral/not under some worldly power. The state is there to represent the people's will. Except for 3 years under Napoleonic rule (by conquest), Neutrality has served the safety of the people well. 

Switzerland is a humanist country. Individual liberty, civil life is the highest good, NOT politics, the direct democratic political system of domestic policy is a example for that. check it out, very interesting in comparison to most. 

So neutrality always is a delicate matter and comes at a cost. The judgment on that is opinion.

 Russia killed 1,500,000 of their own people to achieve a socialist state.
Russia does not play.  You cannot shame them on social media, threaten them at UN or tell them what to do.  

 Sean Penn going to Ukraine does not frighten Vladimir Putin.  

 Ukraine is begging for soldiers and take all comers.  People from across the world are joining them.  The Russian people have no such freedom.

 Russia cites the reason for the war as Ukraine refused to say they would not join NATO.

 The real reason is that no Communist country be they Russia or China can abide a western-leaning country on their border including Finland.  That is why they threatened Finland.

 If Putin goes there will be no move towards freedom. They have thousands of Putin's ready to take the reins. 

 Think for a minute: the entire planet is terrified of war with Russia or China.  They can do what they want because they know we cannot win any war with them.  God help us if they ever join forces and decide they want to rule the world and not just Ukraine or Taiwan.

MECHANISM: 
The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules, as they come into contact with the air, generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.[11]

In confinement, a series of reflective shock waves is generated,[12][13] which maintain the fireball and can extend its duration to between 10 and 50 ms as exothermic recombination reactions occur.[14] Further damage can result as the gases cool and pressure drops sharply, leading to a partial vacuum. This rarefaction effect has given rise to the misnomer ""vacuum bomb"". Piston-type afterburning[clarification needed] is also believed to occur in such structures, as flame-fronts accelerate through it.[15]",854e48c4977c8ef4fe075c8521d4eab89b926c11,True,False,,,,,0,1646218766,,0,{},hz1a7t5,False,t3_t4eeqj,False,True,t1_hz1a2vy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4eeqj/what_kind_of_weapon_is_this_sent_from_kharkov_a/hz1a7t5/,1646218782,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646189966.0,,,,

Putin and his media have carefully constructed an airtight narrative around Ukraine and NATO, the whole Nazism and NATO threat bullshit. I can guarantee that if you were to only consume government media, you'd believe it too.

Protesters get put in jail. Public dissenting figures lose jobs, lose influence or get disappeared. Information sources that suggest there might be something going on get suppressed. What do you suggest, exactly?

Do you expect babushka to walk up to the kremlin with an AK to get shot down? Do you want mass protests? How would they even coordinate this, social media is locked down heavily.

The documented facts are as follows (if you have a credible source of proven information otherwise - not opinion, I’d be happy to retract my statements):

The NRA received a $1000 membership dues payment by Torshin to become a lifetime member of the NRA (which is the top tier of membership you can get). You pay yearly otherwise for your membership. No contributions or donations were made outside of that. 

The FBI investigation and arrest was of Butina acting as a foreign agent, and was advancing Russia’s strategic objectives in part by establishing relationships with American political organizations that INCLUDED the NRA. Which means the NRA was just one of many organizations she created a relationship with. 

The only money mentioned in the indictment was $125,000 requested by Butina to participate in major upcoming conferences of “Political Party 1”, NOT the NRA and NOT for donations.

Furthermore, nothing from the FBI or otherwise indicates anything in regards to “increase far-right radicalism”.",b47284c4176ef1ce7f70a90b7b5a087dedf28086,True,False,,,,,0,1646222241,,0,{},hz1eztg,True,t3_t4au2o,False,True,t1_hz1c6k7,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4au2o/for_those_with_gun_control_on_their_minds/hz1eztg/,1646222252,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646193441.0,,,,

No, where did I say that? How did you get that from my statement? I condemn the Iraq war because it was wrong.

Iraq wasn't on good terms with the world, so when the US attacked, people didn't feel so bad. 

NATO forces were originally created as a reaction to soviet actions post ww2 - Stalin annexed most of Eastern Europe, and the west formed a block to prevent further expansion. Neither side can give up their missiles and defenses because they don't trust the other side not to use it as an excuse to attack. NATO forces also aren't just the US - does Poland not have the right to protection from their allies? What about the Baltic states, which Russia has repeatedly spoken of conquering?

This is very harsh, but to stop Putin Russia must stop.

Its the same as saying we shouldn't show the faces of starving children.

Show the life story of every noble man that dies in some petty war for greed and bring awareness to this on a global, deeply personal level, and we will have inoculated war criminals from their tyranny and cut the string of fear and control.

Or keep the convention in place, hide the hero's and succumb to the fear of bad actors. This is the current state of the convention.

The army in Russia is a closed system no different from a prison. Like anywhere else, people don’t get into the army or into prison unless the authorities want them there. Unlike other places, once you are in, you live the life of a slave. Armies everywhere try to keep what they do quiet, and perhaps this is why we talk about generals as if they belonged to an international tribe whose personality is the same all over the world, irrespective of which president or state they serve.
There are, however, further peculiarities specific to the Russian army or, rather, to relations between the army and the civilian population. The civilian authorities have no control over what happens in the military. A private, who belongs to the lowest caste in the hierarchy, is a nobody, a nothing. Behind the concrete walls of the barracks, officers can mistreat soldiers with impunity. Similarly, a senior officer can do anything he fancies, anything at all, to a junior colleague.
You are probably thinking that things surely cannot be so bad.
Well, not always; sometimes things are better, but only because some humane individual has called his subordinates to order. Those are the only rays of hope.
“But what about Russia’s leaders?” you may wonder. “The president is the commander in chief, personally responsible for what goes on, isn’t he?”
Unfortunately, once they make it to the Kremlin, our leaders abandon any attempt to rein in the army’s lawlessness and are more likely to give senior officers ever greater power. The army either supports or undermines the leaders depending on whether they indulge it. The one attempt to humanize the army was made under Boris Yeltsin as part of an effort to promote democratic freedom. The program didn’t last long. In Russia, holding on to power is more important than saving soldiers’ lives, and under a barrage of fury from the generals, Yeltsin ran up the white flag and surrendered.
Putin hasn’t even tried. He himself is a former officer. End of story. When he first emerged as a possible head of state rather than an unpopular director of the universally detested Federal Security Bureau (FSB), he started making pronouncements to the effect that the army, diminished under Yeltsin and by its defeat in the first Chechen war, would be rejuvenated, and that all it lacked for its rebirth was a second Chechen war. This assertion is responsible for everything that has followed. When the second Chechen war began, in 1999, the army was given free rein, and in the presidential elections of 2000, it voted as one for Putin. For the army, the present war has been highly profitable, a source of medals and accelerated promotions, and a first-rate springboard for a political career. Generals who leave active service are catapulted directly into the political elite.
How exactly Putin helped the army we shall see in the stories that follow. You decide whether you would like to live in a country where your taxes maintain such an institution. How would you feel if when your son turned eighteen, he was conscripted as “human materiel”? How secure would you feel with an army where every week the soldiers desert in droves, sometimes whole squads at a time, even entire companies. What would you think of an army in which, in a single year, 2002, a complete battalion, more than five hundred men, had been killed not by enemy fire but by beatings, and in which the officers steal everything, from the ten-rouble notes privates receive from their parents to a full tank column?

Do you think those who surrender, will actually get the crypto money?

Looking at the videos of Russian soldiers who has surrendered, it doesn't look like situations where anyone would say ""Hi do you want five million crypto dollars?"".

And if any Ukrainian soldier really said this, I suspect the Russian captives would think it was a joke? And if a Russian captive said ""When will I get my five million crypto dollars?"", he'd get punched in the face or laughed at?

But at the same time: For a Russian soldier who avoided entering Ukraine at all, and somehow manage to escape to Poland/the Baltics/somewhere, then, if he got money, so he could live for a while in Europe -- that makes sense? And he could tell others back in Russia that they can avoid the war altogether, by fleeing to Europe, and they'd get money and could live there until the war was over? And after that, they could contact Ukraine, which would say to Russia that they had been prisoners-of-war.

Maybe money to those who never enter Ukraine?

Folks just have to make due with the best they have which is western media at the moment. Russian media is nearly entirely discredited because it controlled by the government, and Russian unbiased reporting got left dead in a forest somewhere with their murdered journalists. In some ways the most authentic pieces of information are from various social media accounts of folks in the war zone because it hasn't been filtered, but that's certainly not perfect as we've seen. 

The Ukrainian government is drafting men to fight an invasion. Literally any country would do this if they thought it will help them. It is indeed necessary to fight and not roll over or your country won't exist, and you can have no assurances about how an occupying force will treat the defeated country. The Ukrainians remember well the Soviet caused famine, the Nazi invasion, and the 14,000 dead from the Donbas conflict. They've seen the images of bombed out cities, and heard of the torture, rapes, and killings committed in Chechnya. They are aware of the reputation of Kadyrov and why Putin has unleashed these thugs in Ukraine. Why would any Ukrainian want that, and there is absolutely a point where peace is not worth it. 

Also, defeat is not a forgone conclusion. There is money, weapons, and aid flowing into Ukraine, and in a situation like that it's entirely possible to drag out the war and force Russia to back off. The foreign aid part of the equation is important because it was Chinese aid that allowed North Korea and North Vietnam to fight the United States, it was US aid that allowed Afghanistan to fight Russia, and it was Pakistani aid that allowed the Taliban to fight the US. A safe origin of foreign aid means the fighting only stops when the soldiers stop fighting as opposed to when they run out of ammunition. This kind of conflict can absolutely down a super power. What's working against Ukraine in this arena is it's flat terrain and open fields where the Russian military would operate best.

There is no ego battle on the part of Ukraine here. It is a fight for their independence.

Keep in mind Ukraine has just conscripted shit loads of random people, and they're just people in chaos, some of them might be racist and handle these situations extremely badly. This is ok, brown people can separate these people from all the people, but the point that you and everyone else not only misses but actively fights against, is that this should not be happening. No excuses. I don't care if the devil himself possessed this man to do this, it should not have happened. It did happen tho, nothing we can do about it, but it's this insane need from some people here like yourself to deny it that is making it into such a massive deal. Acknowledge it happened and this all goes away.

This guy was at the Ukrainian polish border when this was said. You saying a border 300km away might accelerate things when they're literally meters away from the polish border is why people are so angry about this, it's excuse after excuse after excuse.

Quote:

&gt;ISTANBUL, Feb 27 (Reuters) - NATO member Turkey changed its rhetoric to call Russia's assault on Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday and pledged to implement parts of an international pact that would potentially limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyiv had appealed to Ankara to block any more Russian ships from entering the Black Sea, from which Moscow launched an incursion on Ukraine's southern coast. At least six Russian warships and a submarine transited Turkey's straits this month.

And I want the West to make a statement – or if that is absolutely not possible, otherwise effectively communicate – to the Russian people that if they remove Putin, and his successor orders an end to the war in Ukraine, all will be forgiven, all sanctions removed, Russia readmitted to the international community of culture and business and politics.   
To state clearly that we understand this is not the Russian people doing evil, but one man, and that him disappearing will fix this problem.   
I think this is de facto already the case, but hope an official statement to this effect would accelerate the process and improve the chances.  
I think this is not only the way to end this conflict with the least loss of life - I think it may also be the only way, period.  
No matter how badly the war against Ukraine goes and how long it drags on, Putin cannot afford to lose this – he must know that losing may cost him his power and his life, and therefore I think he won't – even if that means encircling and starving Kyiv while firing low-precision missiles in the city centre until the civilians are all dead and the essential infrastructure and culture are all rubble, even if it means threatening of deploying a tactical nuke against Poland to stop NATO reinforcements. I fear he will escalate as much as he can until he wins, and he can escalate much.   
There is no way Ukraine can defend itself against the overwhelming power of unprecise, severe airstrikes that Russia has in reserve. And as the West, what more can we do without risking open confrontation between nuclear powers, risking all of us? You can't militarily defeat a man this delusional, definitely not without first going through everyone between him and you, and he is putting his whole people in the way to be hurt in his stead.  
 But his people can remove him. His people removing him seems the plausible endgoal of all these sanctions. The earlier they do, the less the damage to Russia, the less the ordinary people get hurt.  
The horrors inflicted upon Ukraine are intolerable. But I also grieve the Russian soldiers forced and tricked into this war. Innocent children are dying each day for this war, while Putin sits safe behind the lines.  
I don't think Putin will ever surrender, no matter how many Russians die and what atrocities are necessary against Ukrainians and how much he has to starve Russia to finance this. I think he is more likely to nuke the planet than give in.  
But I don't think the Russians will tolerate it. There are protests by ordinary people, despite the crackdowns, because this is atrocious, because Putin is shelling civilians in a country they consider their brother. Celebrities, politicians and people across all fields of work are speaking out. The political opposition has condemned this war. Many of the oligarchs are turning on Putin. The Kremlin and the military, while clearly intimidated, must be utterly frustrated. There have been several key mistakes made in this campaign that cost many Russians their lives, and that are hard to explain – and one of the most plausible ways to explain this is that Putin has created a culture of such pressure and fear that it feels impossible to communicate bad news to him or refuse him, and so he keeps ordering more and more mad moves based on intel viewed through rosy glasses, and the generals giving the orders must know that this idiocy is killing their men. This sounds like there are a rising number of people well positioned and motivated to take Putin out, be it by an angry individual assassinating him, a military coup, a legal move by parliament handing him over to be tried for war crimes, a public mov storming his home and lynching him, or whatever other option, and a rising amount of public support would back this. If we put the idea out there and argued for it, spelled out the consequences, is it so implausible that it might happen? And seeing this clusterfuck, wouldn't a replacement for Putin likely not repeat these mistakes?  
What would be the repercussions of outright saying this? Could this be avoided by communicating it differently?  
I hate that Ukrainians and Russians are dying for this man, that Russia and Ukraine are suffering for this man, that we are fighting him so indirectly by fighting Russians who did not choose this. We are fighting the wrong people. The Russian conscripts, crying and hungry and wanting to go home, are not the enemy. The Russian start-ups going broke are not the enemy. The ordinary people losing their pensions are not the enemy. There is no limit to how many troops Putin will throw in the grinder to be incinerated. He will never start caring for them.

Their military budget is 1/10 the US budget. They have only built 14 of their new generation of tank and it’s not even clear if any are battle ready. So Russia could not afford to go electric if they wanted too.

The single biggest issue is that typically in a war zone you don’t have an electric grid to plug into. Renewable energy is not at a point it could be deployed for this large of a task. Small scale nuclear should never be deployed to a war zone. Coal, nat gas, diesel generation have same issue as refueling the tanks. I don’t see a solution to this issue.

Another problem is energy density, a typical tank has a fuel capacity of about 250 gallons and a range similar to a car so you would need the battery equivalent of about 15-20 Teslas (didn’t feel like doing the math so may be off a bit). Finally, you have the issue of durability. Diesel engines are extremely durable, lasting many decades and can be stored without maintenance between conflicts, batteries as you know cannot.

Swiss government works quite differently that most.
Our state does not have an opinion. Government is a tool. it is not supposed to have an opinion. Does your car have an opinion o traffic? 

The taking the stance just took time. The government is designed slow, so haste, emotionality and fallacy does not tarnish good governance. Haste makes waste. They had to vote, and that was earliest possible on Monday. Its a wonder it went that quickly... most often it takes weeks of discussions due to diffence in opinions. this time it did not. For Swiss government that was fast. It's hard to understand Swiss politics if your unfamiliar with it. But I encurrage you to inform yourself about it. Might be inspirational. 

Switzerland was one of the first countries bringing diplomatic focus onto Ukraine pleading for action from UN on humanitarian grounds due to fear of a humanitarian crisis. Making major global sanction, cooperation and cohesive Action in time possible. 
Weeks befor most Americans legislators even had a clue where Ukraine is.

I respond to the second: If you can show me one place where op said that all Ukrainians are racist, or in that video where someone said all Ukrainians are racist, then you have a valid point. But this was not said, and so you you using this as a defense sounds like a denial. You can say the first paragraph without saying the second and you will be happy and the person hearing what you said will be happy, and the problem will go away.

I respond to your third paragraph: one of the complaints is that there was a queue for Indians and Blacks, and a separate queue for whites. The justification is that Ukrainians must leave first, and this is fair, but only 20% of international students are black, and passports were not checked in these queues, meaning there were certainly white people in this Ukrainian queue who were taken out of danger only because they were white. I don't care to debate demographics of efficiency here, I am only pointing out that being advantaged some people and bring brown disadvantaged some people and this is the very definition of racism. It's a complex situation and brown people will forgive this if you share their pain, but if you make excuses then they will think that you want them disadvantaged, that this was not just a careless accident when trying to get Ukrainians out but rather a wider issue.

I respond to your forth paragraph: if Ukraine had prepared better they would not be in this situation. You see how me saying this that makes you feel? They will feel the same when you say what you said. It is a terrible situation, they are there and it doesn't matter the reason, and saying that they are less worthy of protection or safety simply because they are not Ukrainian (or in the case of the black/white queue, not white), is a problem. It contradicts your first paragraph.

I hope you take time to read this and not just respond in defense. All I am asking you to do in future is write the first paragraph that you wrote, and then stop. Because if you can do this, then people feel heard, and then the story in the rest of Reddit that this sub is burying and denying these incidents of racism goes away.",f68614e7fb0da08d7421fce750796e022633b1cd,True,False,,,,,0,1646262955,,0,{},hz43gxw,False,t3_t4igok,False,True,t1_hz40idd,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4igok/kick_racism_out_this_is_upsetting/hz43gxw/,1646262970,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646234155.0,,,,

So what I did was export every single video I have sent since the start of the invasion, which is 147 atm.

A lot of these links may start going inactive in the near future, so I really want to back all of this up, instead of just having the URLs. All the videos have their metadata kept from the discord chat, so they're in mostly chronological order as far as the conflict is concerned, bar me going to sleep and then quickly catching up, or finding a slightly older video later than it was really released. I've included as much footage from the Russian side as I could, but Ukrainian-side footage prevails massively; I have a lot of sources I'm subscribed to since from when the conflict started in 2014. I also have a lot less trust in Russian footage in general, for obvious reasons.

I have chosen to include NSFW footage, as it's really important to me to save what this war really was, not what was shown on TV (wide shots of smoke), so keep that in mind if you wanna get into this.

When this footage is gone from Twitter and Youtube, it'll be much harder to prove some of these atrocities happened. Many ex-Warsaw pact countries have this russophile-russophobe divide, which is now widening and people are starting to entrench on each side. Just because Russia is in a war, it doesn't mean they've stopped exporting corruption to the rest of Europe.
