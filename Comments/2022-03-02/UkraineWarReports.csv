So what I did was export every single video I have sent since the start of the invasion, which is 147 atm.

A lot of these links may start going inactive in the near future, so I really want to back all of this up, instead of just having the URLs. All the videos have their metadata kept from the discord chat, so they're in mostly chronological order as far as the conflict is concerned, bar me going to sleep and then quickly catching up, or finding a slightly older video later than it was really released. I've included as much footage from the Russian side as I could, but Ukrainian-side footage prevails massively; I have a lot of sources I'm subscribed to since from when the conflict started in 2014. I also have a lot less trust in Russian footage in general, for obvious reasons.

I have chosen to include NSFW footage, as it's really important to me to save what this war really was, not what was shown on TV (wide shots of smoke), so keep that in mind if you wanna get into this.

When this footage is gone from Twitter and Youtube, it'll be much harder to prove some of these atrocities happened. Many ex-Warsaw pact countries have this russophile-russophobe divide, which is now widening and people are starting to entrench on each side. Just because Russia is in a war, it doesn't mean they've stopped exporting corruption to the rest of Europe.

Really? I mean, a video of a 19-year-old soldier crying to his mom while saying 'They told me we were doing training exercises and then they dropped us into Ukraine and made us kill civilians' makes the regime look *pretty* *fucking bad*. I highly doubt they were told to cry and confess to being told to commit war crimes.  I would expect pre-rehearsed lines to be in line with Putin's narrative, which would be something like 'We came to liberate the sovereign states of Donetsk and Lugansk from fascist tyranny,' etc. 

You know, kinda like what this guy says. He's definitely reading off a script and lying about how long he's served for, but he's not a common soldier or conscript like most of these videos are. It's not like Russia's compulsory military service is a secret, nor is their extensive history of treating their own soldiers inhumanely and using 'meat grinder' tactics to throw bodies at a problem. That's the old-school Soviet mentality applied to war strategy: No one individual matters, only the strength of the collective whole. 

And so humanizing the individuals that were captured or surrendered isn't really for the soldier's sake. It's to highlight the reality that morale among a non-insignificant number of Russian soldiers is *really fucking low,* which is the exact opposite of the image of unwavering patriotism and military strength that the Russian propaganda machine tries so hard to project. Acknowledging that is not propaganda, but in fact is countering propaganda. The empathy people feel for them (myself included) is just a side effect of being human.",1f7c0db7ad2aee34bd3f4b33264762c73deef26d,True,False,,,,,0,1646264406,,0,{},hz46m9z,False,t3_t50fyj,False,True,t1_hz3cu9v,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t50fyj/another_captured_russian_gru_special_forces/hz46m9z/,1646264417,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646235606.0,,,,

That being said do you think they’ve changed their ways in how they view their population? They are all pons to them, willing to use as many necessary to take Ukraine. 

Reread what you replied to, you might understand Ukraine’s situation a lot better. It’s all common sense with knowledge of history and standing alliances. 

“That 40 mile convoy can easily be destroyed” so why doesn’t any country move in to do so? They fear Russia, regardless of the nukes. Europe in it’s entirety relies on oil imported from Russia as well as the US. Even so, if they cut them off, they are already well funded from the fortune they made from crypto currency. 

Back to the original reason why I commented on this post: No amount of “stolen abandoned Russian vehicles” mean anything. No amount of heart-warming tiktoks on how they treat Russian prisoners mean anything. Putin will keep sending waves after waves of troops, he will take Ukraine no matter how sloppy it was taken. He’s a dictator, he does not care for how many casualties Russia suffers to accomplish that. Ukraine does not have enough people and firepower to compete against a world-power like that.

The Imperial Japanese Navy's last operation was Operation Ten-Go, and was decimated on a suicide run because they didn't have air cover, which was itself was decimated in ""The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot"", so named because it was a Turkey Shoot. Granted Japan was running out of oil of oil too - so basically everything (planes, pilots, fuel).

The Russians should have air superiority and even with obscure targets like a TB2, they could solve this problem by striking the ground control stations, which give away their position.

But the Russians don't have a precision strike capability, apparently don't have a tactical electronic detection capability, or targeting cycle to find, fix track, target, execute, assess, or the range to do any of this, or the freedom to loiter around like they do in Syria, which is just the same game, except you're hunting SAMs, which also shoot back.

The only thing revolutionary about drones at the low end, it has significantly reduced the barrier to entry for an air asset.

Force on force of just drones of this class, you'd do the same thing as with manned fixed wing assets. There are other tools you can use, but destroying the control station is still the easiest. In a conflict zone where everyone looks the same, you can sabotage the control station, and if thats too guarded, just murder the pilots, or their families.

Plus also stated above, the way Russia uses tanks when they are not an anti-tank force, is as armored mobile artillery. Traditionally tanks are unsuitable for urban warfare. The Russians solve this just destroying the city. Problem solved.

Historic examples: The counter to calvary and the knight, the predecessor to the tank, in medieval warfare was the pikeman and the archer (and really crossbowman).

A pikeman, with say a ""javelin"" in theory in a formation can stop a calvary advance. This requires you and hundreds of your illiterate buddies to stand there and be crushed by a ton of animal and man, moving at 20-30 mph. Your reward is maybe the guy behind you lives.

Archers also required training to be effective. Crossbowmen lowered this requirement, and why it was banned by the Pope, not that anyone cared. That still wasn't enough until the proliferation of gun powder, which only eventually eliminated armor. Calvary charges could still destroy formations. It took until WWI where calvary was made obsolete (by the tank).

The counter to all this though, at any point in time, is fire and maneuver. For Russia, anti-tank infantry, even with the most advanced missiles, wouldn't be an issue if it was advancing at a pace faster than Ukraine could recover. Drones wouldn't be an issue if it had air superiority and really the ability to strike the control stations, which are fixed positions, and inherently give away their position.

The lesson on modern warfare says less about the tank, drones, or missiles, but Russian incompetence.",7e8984a9d2314713362f12f0a1a11de443f8186d,True,False,,,,,0,1646250262,,0,{},hz38lyw,False,t3_t51zsn,False,True,t1_hz24itx,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t51zsn/ukrainian_minister_of_defense_reznikov_says_a_new/hz38lyw/,1646250276,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646221462.0,,,,

The US Army requested to stop procuring the M1 Abrams in the early 2000s, because it had plenty for the conflicts it was fighting and projected to fight. Then Congress ordered them for a decade more because it was a jobs program in battleground state Ohio. 

This predates drone's and anti-tank weaponry's demonstrated effectiveness against really Cold War era tanks, other mechanized infantry, and unarmored convoys, which isn't really surprising. Develop a weapon to destroy an asset, and it destroys an even less capable asset. Nothing has fundamentally changed.

USMC and other countries and have been divesting their tanks because they are expensive and there are only a few places that can support large scale tank battles. Again though one of them is Europe (the others are the Indian Subcontinent, Central Asia, and the Russian Far East/Manchuria). 

While arguably the UK for example could divest its entire tank force (it almost has), it has also hollowed out other capabilities that are important to an island nation, like anti-submarine warfare. This was driven by cost, not need.

Same for Germany and infamously many of its neighbors. The Netherlands sold all of its tanks, and a few years later, had to join the German tank units (the people who historically who have invaded them with tanks).

Furthermore the way Russia uses tanks, that it already has and as stated needs (Europe, Central Asia, Far East), they use them as armored mobile artillery.

I'm sad you're being downvoted, because now most people who have your question and want to learn won't see your question. It's a good question if you don't already know the answer from reading other Reddit posts. 

Google maps usually requires internet via local cell towers to load the map and traffic data, and it requires signals from GPS satellites. 

Local cell towers have likely been bombed by the Russians. This is why Elon Musk sent over all the Starlink equipment, so that Ukranians can get Internet from space satellites. 

It's possible though that the Russians already have those maps cached on their phones, so that leaves the GPS signal from the satellites. 

It is not uncommon for countries to have the satellites send erroneous GPS information during wartime, so that it shows you in the wrooooong place on the map, or not at all.

Plus, Russia doesn't trust their soldiers, and they're not allowed to carry personal cells into battles, because they can be used to track their location, just like your cell can be used by your government to track your position, speed, direction you're facing, steps you're taking, what you turn to look at, and everyone you communicate with, every word you say, your personal sexual fetishes, how many orgasms you have per week, and how long it takes you to cum.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

That makes them one of us. As they should have been, for a long time now, it seems. 

We *are* doing anything we can *without direct war* with Russia. But I fear that will not be enough. And I for one feel very ashamed that we are content on the sidelines. It is easy for us to sit back, send missiles and hope only a few thousand ukrainian children will die. In reality we have the power to step in and say 'enough'.  

I understand people's worries about the nuclear deterrent. It is almost certainly a bluff on Putin's part, but fair enough, we can't be fully certain. There is a line, however, how far we can allow ourselves to be pushed back under threat of nuclear war. And we *must* draw that line. 

&gt;If we fail to take Putin down, he will do this again as it seems like a working strategy. Just like Hitler invaded Poland after he got away with Czechoslovakia. Putin might even go for Poland just for the meme.

According to the story, the Zaporozhian Cossacks (from ""beyond the rapids"", Ukrainian: za porohamy), inhabiting the lands around the lower Dnieper River in Ukraine, had defeated Ottoman Empire forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by Ivan Sirko, replied in a characteristic manner; they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities.  
  
Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks: As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians – I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.  
— Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV  
  
The Cossacks' reply came as a stream of insulting and vulgar rhymes:  
Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!  
O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons. We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee. Fuck thy mother.  
Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow. Screw thine own mother!  
So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord. The day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!

Then there was alot of  talk about ""Armata"", supposedly best tank in  the world, all talk but no action. 

When it comes to  Ukraine vs Russia, main reason to why Russia is struggling atm is mainly because of Turkish drones who ukraine got, but also because of the west(Nato, US) with its intel, weapon supplies, economical support, sanctions on russia, propaganda etc. Lastly we got the Ukrainian army which isnt small at tall, especially for an  European country, they are also very motivated to fight Putin because of Crimea and the proxy wars Putin started in east Ukraine.

&gt;	⚡️Summary of today's extremely difficult day.

&gt;In the afternoon, we received information about the Russian military column, which was moving towards Kryvyi Rih from Bashtanka and counted about 800 units of wheel equipment.

&gt;Our defenders worked promptly, not leaving the enemy a chance to even enter the territory of Dnipropetrovsk. The column was attacked from the air, the occupiers got hit hard. And they’ll get it even harder if they try to break through the border area again.

&gt;The enemy will never get Kryvyi Rih. They will not receive a single piece of land of any other settlement of Dnipropetrovsk region. This is our home that we will defend every second.

&gt;Regarding the situation in the region as a whole, everything is under control. The Regional Council held a meeting with the heads of communities, security forces, military, people's deputies. There is understanding, who, how should act and what to do in any scenario, there is coexistence, and there is a willingness to give away. We are together, we are close to people, we work.

&gt;Ukraine survived today, another terrible day. The world once again saw what ""Russian peace"" is. But the Ukrainian peace is stronger. Ukrainians are stronger.

When I was about 10 I saw for the first time news showing a city getting shelled. I froze. I knew it was real, but I wanted to believe it's a movie, that nobody actually died. That people can't be monsters. That.. 

Then, about 6 years ago, I was watching the news, they were showing images of refugees getting rescued fron the waters. Most of them were people who sold EVERYTHING they had, trying to buy a way out from the war in Sirya, Afghanistan,  Iraq.. instead of a safety net, they got lied to and ended up on an inflatable boat, left on their own, lost in the ocean for days on end and eventually, when they got to a shore, or when they got rescued by a ship, they were mostly treated like nothing. Nobody wanted them, countries were fighting between each other because nobody wanted the responsibility. I felt so hopeless. 
I feel so hopeless. You can donate, and get involved, try to help and still feel so overwhelmed.

Get your mind of the DPR/LPR being some ethnically oppressed victims in all of this. DRP/LPR troops are primarily just Russian soldiers - and use Russian military equipment.

Even after years of conflict, a majority of actual DPR/LPR residents wanted to re-unify with Ukraine and only a tiny minority wanted to remain independent or join Russia.

First of all, I don't think this really happened. 

Second, even if it did, you have no idea what context it happened under. For example, a frequently reported video was one where border guards were pushing back people - who had jumped the line at the border crossing. Border guards don't fuck around - particularly when they're literally at war. 

Third, if it did happen, that's unfortunate. IT just doesn't matter. This is the least important of the thousands of horrible things that have happened this week in and around Ukraine. Just deal with it.  The hand wringing and tears and pearl clutching over this as India literally helps Russia invade another country - is pathetic.",eb97c24e6820b1748949854271ec9975724ea6a5,True,False,,,,,0,1646206712,,0,{},hz0v1qo,False,t3_t4s49h,False,True,t1_hz0uhoy,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t4s49h/ill_treatment_with_indian_students_despite_of/hz0v1qo/,1646206723,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646177912.0,,,,

India is literally the country that is most helpful toward and doing the most to support the Russian invasion. 

India has not joined sanctions, it's not censured or said anything against Russia about the conflict, it's merely worked to help Russia avoid sanctions over the conflict. 

&gt; Visa isse ! seriously! Govt of india and poland are already in talks terms and there no such thing as Visa issue during ""Uplift"" .. already our nation is ready with shelters and airplanes in poland with the help of polish govt. they are just waiting for students to cross border... which Ukrainian officials are not allowing to may be because of political agenda

What is your evidence of this? 

First, Ukrainian officials don't process visas at the Polish border, Polish officials do. Second, it doesn't matter what India has behind the border, India does not have visa-free travel to Poland. Ukrainians do. 

&gt; Ukrainian Diplomat has also threatened us in a way look for urself :

There's no evidence of this provided in the video.

Secondly Trump asked for NATO members to meet the NATO membership guidelines of 2% GDP, that's strengthening NATOs army not weakening it, because of Trump 15 billion per year more was spend on NATO by countries not the United States. This made Ukraine really want to join NATO along with Finland now.

Trump also gave Ukraine military aid during his time in office but withheld 250 million due to corruption in the justice department of Ukraine allowing people to be above the law.

Biden is weak and this shows it, his SOTU was a joke he looked incompetent and flip flopped on issues mid speech. 

This is a west vs Russia issue, Trump has nothing to do with it, it is however weird that Russia has not invaded any country while a Republican president was in office.

 The world needs to end its dependency on shady oil and just develop its own. Canada which has so much oil and gas reserves last year imported 17% of its gas from Russia, the us which under trump was a net exporter for 3 years, imported 21% of its gas from Russia in 2021.

The truth is that politicians and governments  from around the world have created a situation where Ukraine has been vulnerable to these sorts of attacks from Putin. The Ukrainian people are now paying the price for the greed of others. Biden has literally admitted to withholding aid from Ukraine as vice president. Despite how the fact checkers, chose to spin that situation. The proof is out there for anyone to find. Obama's administration also refused to provide lethal aid to Ukraine to avoid inflaming relations with Russia. Trump reversed that and was the first president to provide them with the long requested and now vital lethal aid. It was pointed out at the time that Russia was not happy with that decision. He also levied sanctions against the nordstream pipeline that Biden reversed. That absolutely empowered Putin. Trump certainly isn't blameless by withholding aid as well. My point is that politicians have not been looking out for Ukraine's best interest for decades. I'm not even going to go into the Crimea and Georgia invasions that past governments failed to properly address. NATO has been too disconnected and disjointed for decades. Putin at least has galvanized them. I hope they can actually come together because of this.

Even i am not talking just by watching some news .i myself have my juniors studying in Ukraine and i am pretty sure they wont be lying about the treatment they recieve from Ukrainian officials

there are other videos where the girl tells that they(all students of different countries) are taken into a room  and ask to play some ""game"" which depicts BULLYING and making fun of and if they fail to do so they are kicked and punched . idk where it is written that during time of war if everyone is leaving the country they should physically assault the foreigner students ? 

They have bigger and deeper and more dirtier agenda. It looks like they are using them as a shield for their political benefits , even the Ukrainian ambassador has answered diplomatically when questioned by our diplomats.

never the less we are still in support of the common people of Ukraine and will always be because its the common man who suffers !
 here are some links if it is helpful

In this video student has mentioned: girls arm fractured hairs pulled during the assault , discrimination against indian and they r letting Ukrainian cross the order despite poland and indian govt agreeing to help indian students aswell (NO mention of VISA  issue)

Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way

You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But it isn't, in fact most of the larger cities were bypassed and Russia does not have troops to encircle them properly and they were never planning on needing to. The result is raids by territorial defense and Ukranian army units to disrupt Russian supplies and take their arms, food, and even vehicles for themselves.
