One thing Ukraine would very much like is modern combat aircraft. These would give it air superiority which would maker it very hard for Russia to perform large scale manouvres (because the vehicles would be spotted and attacked).

However, they need pilots and you can't just stick someone in a plane they've never flown before and expect them to be effective. (Does anyone know how long a crash^1 training program to cross-train pilots onto Eurofighters/F-16/F-35 would take?)

It's just really hard to see how (or if) this ends right now, and I keep questioning the following:

 - Does Russia have the munitions necessary for a sustained bombing campaign? 
 - How much has corruption eaten away at their ability or willingness to fight? 
 - There's a lot of conversation about Russian supply lines, but what about their Ukrainian counterparts? And the civilians? Can Ukrainian cities outlast a siege, and for how long?
 - To what degree will non-state actors (or state actors hiding behind a non-state actor) play a role?
 - How many more industries and private companies are going to abandon Russia? (Boeing and Airbus' withdrawal alone will cripple Russian civil aviation in the space of a month.)
 - To what length will Putin go to conceal the truth of what's happening from the Russian people? 
 - Does the Russian military feel empowered to say no to a disastrously-bad or objectionable order?
 - Is there a black swan out there that's going to rear its head at some point?
 - Is there going to be a point at which the FSB or GRU says they've had enough?
 - If things get bad enough, is Russia willing to withdraw to Donbas/Luhansk with a land bridge to Crimea and declare victory?
 - How many resources does Ukraine's military really have, and are they able to get them to the units that need them most?
 - Is someone out there going to recognize that Russia needs an off-ramp, and offer an olive branch on conditions the Russians are willing to meet? At present there's not much incentive for them to do anything other than doubling down -- but that could change if the EU/NATO say, hey, we'll work with you, but you gotta shuffle Putin out of the way first. The Russian elite may increasingly see that as the most attractive option.

Urban environments, especially those with multiple-storey buildings and relatively narrow streets, are optimum for this. They offer natural cover and concealment, and often offer a means of quick and concealed retreat (deeper into the building, or through it into the next block over).  


Roadways with sharply elevated terrain on one or both sides, or large walls or berms or some other form of hard cover would be viable. Risky if the ambush fails and you're driven back beyond that cover into open terrain though.  


Thick folliage or other soft cover could work, but as we see in this clip, that poses major risks - because you're more likely to be spotted (visually or through thermal) before having chance to engage, and if spotted are much more likely to be successfully attacked and killed before having the opportunity to disengage and retreat.",e1e03a424f56441997e1476d81325868b80653bb,True,False,,,,,0,1646262055,,0,{},hz41gyo,False,t3_t59a98,False,True,t3_t59a98,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t59a98/molotov_cocktails_are_they_actually_useful_in_any/hz41gyo/,1646262069,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646233255.0

But as they started their slow withdrawal from Iraq after 2011 and observed how quickly it transformed into an Iranian puppet state, most Americans finally got wise to the scam the warhawks like Bolton and Rumsfeld promised- ""nationbuilding"" in the middle east had an abysmally poor ROI. So they gave up, left some weapons and money, and threw in the towel. As many suspected, the Afghan government and military quickly folded like paper and the Taliban moved in. What was unexpected was *how quickly* they folded.

It's fair to say that Taliban wasn't particularly resourceful on their own- they were backed by Pakistan... and another nation I must not mention- its thinskinned nationalism is notoriously delusional to the point of absurd, and they get butthurt way too easily to continue a civil conversation.

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"There's a few things that go into this. First as others already mentioned the ambition was a lightning victory over Ukraine that would ""re-establish a great state"". Just as importantly there were fundamentally flawed assumptions in planning that led ""expensive, slow"" artillery based war to be both impossible and undesirable.

Russian doctrine is predicated on the ideas of ""norms"" - force ratios and tactical recommendations that usually generate victory. It's an incredibly hand waiving and armchair approach to combat. They are liable to ignore tactical realities in favor of adjusting the operational and strategic situation, thus the tightly spaced convoys and employment of unsupported armor and airdrops. Shifting tactical realities with drones and increasingly common ATGMs don't factor into Russian planning as much as tried and tested principles, like the idea that if the Russians deploy more than 3/2 the opposing force their chances of victory are excellent. To use a simpler analogy, Russia is like a boxer who's constantly trying to improve his cardio instead of sparring. The Russian army is the best in the world at mobilizing a large number of troops and getting them to the right place, but this operation has revealed that tactics are often an afterthought.

Shoygu, Gerasimov &amp; company no doubt thought that as long as they followed the correct norms and drew up a ""clever"" operational plan (and, to give them credit, the Black Sea landing and attack through the Pripyat Marshes towards Kiev *were* clever) they could win without laying waste to all of Ukraine, and more importantly costing Russia tens of billions in artillery shells. It's hard to understate just how much self-propelled artillery Russia has: if all its deployed MRBs were firing at full velocity, this offensive would be little better than a bear crawl across Ukraine, no pun intended. The only Russian hope for a quick victory, precluding Western sanctions and intervention, was a series of ""thunder runs"" hoping the Ukrainians collapsed. They did not.

Finally, in the critical theatres of the war conventional Russian doctrine is no longer possible because of logistical realities. Artillery on the scale that Russia possesses it eats munitions like no other arm. The attack on Kiev is spearheaded through Chernobyl, which besides being an abandoned, ex-irradiated wasteland, has only a few roads because it's situated in the middle of the Pripyat Marshes. The marshes have traditionally been seen as ""impassable"" and Shoygu &amp; Gerasimov were no doubt trying to pull an Ardennes and be seen as military geniuses for generations for attacking through them. The entire Northern thrust depended on the element of surprise and the rapid fall of Kiev. Said element did not exist. The result? Depending on the reports, anywhere between 12 and 40 km of convoys, stuck on the road. The Russians already can't supply low intensity offensives, who thinks they can supply the largest artillery barrage in history?

This day and yesterday have seen a pause in the Russian advance, no doubt to transition back to their typical SOP and bring artillery shells to the front. According to what we're seeing with convoys, entire forward shell depots are being relocated inside Ukraine. We *will* see more artillery, just not today.",b36eb86879ea403024a1ec7fce37201b20df0ff1,True,False,,,,,0,1646255539,,0,{},hz3m3ub,False,t3_t43g5w,False,True,t3_t43g5w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t43g5w/why_has_the_russian_artillery_campaign_been_so/hz3m3ub/,1646255553,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646226739.0

China would love a war that bleeds NATO, but this isn't that. It looks to me like the West will gain in the endgame here. US and EU have both been keeping Ukraine at a clear arm's length in view of their corruption problem and not-quite-liberal tendencies, and Ukraine now seems motivated to embrace the LIO fully at the earliest practical point.

&gt;NATO and in particular again US allies further away will get increasingly worried, and perceive the US as being weak and unable to keep up with it's defensive commitments

[],False,,yuccu,,,[],,,,text,t2_416xy,False,False,"Nah. Happy to answer that one though, as I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I choose to get out. It was never about money…the same time I was falling apart physically (already had foot surgery, shoulder was going and back was already shit), didn’t like what I was seeing in the career field (we were severely overmanned, there was no true progression), and was sick of seeing friends killing themselves or, in one case, having a heart attack and dying on the shop floor…all that was going on right as I got my notice to reenlist. 

Seeing how all that was impacting me, my wife was like “what if you didn’t reenlist?” It honestly hadn’t occurred that was even an option. So, I sat down and did the math (base pay, housing, but no bonus, plus potential retirement/disability) and considered everything else that came with the job…those opportunity costs really stuck out as I tried to answer: am I better off if I finish out in Georgia and then do like everyone else and get a contracting or gov job in the building? Do I re-up for four or so more and see what happens? What risks am I taking if I bounce? Where do I have the highest ceiling?

Staying in until retirement or beyond didn’t seem to outweigh all the negatives I saw, especially on the qualitative side. If anything, since there was no clear progression for me (by that I mean the job I was doing, not whether I was promoted or not, though the EPR quota system was a fucking drag), I actually projected that if I stayed in I would be behind where I thought I should be by 2021/22. I figured, instead of depending on the Air Force and hoping they offered up some new opportunity, why not take a risk on me and see what I can do for myself?

After a massive amount of planning, I found a public policy program that interested me back home in Chicago of all places (never thought I was coming back), pitched it to the wife and kids, and made the move. Started school while still on terminal. Then bought a house down the road from where I grew up…it’s awesome, the kids get to hang out with their great grandparents and I reconnected with my old band from high school. 

Professionally, I started engaging with the veteran network out here and talked my way on to the campaign to legalize cannabis in Illinois as a volunteer…ended up working on the veteran provisions that get us more points for licenses than anyone else. Some politician called it a loop hole and that made me beam with pride. Then got a job managing government engagement for a DoD sponsored research institute before I finished undergrad. Now I’m 80% through an MBA program and I just quit that job this month (after 2.5 years) to take a director role at UChicago running programs and services for undergraduate veterans.

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"&gt;The only way it makes sense to me is that Putin actually drank his own Kool-Aid about the unpopularity of the Ukrainian government.

More likely not just Putin, but that his advisors knew what he wanted to hear, so they fudged and fabricated things that would please him, and he believed them. Their subordinates did the same to them, on and on down the chain. The guys at the bottom actually deal with reality but tell their bosses whatever will make them happy and minimize workload. By the time information reaches the guys at the top, it's a complete fantasy. It's the same in any highly conformist authoritarian structure, be it business or politics. When there's no real opposition, you can get away with it for quite a while too.

&gt;Now he is committed and all options are bad. To win militarily it seems clear the Russians need to actually start utilizing more force (already happening). Widespread use of artillery and airstrikes against any and all resistance. Residential areas be damned like in the Second Chechen War.

Ukraine is about 35x larger than Chechnya and has about 30x the population of Chechnya. Ukraine's military + paramilitary + reserves outnumber Putin's deployments by 5:1. Russia does have the advantage in air power and armored vehicles, but western shipments of anti-tank missiles are making the armored vehicle advantage almost worthless. Simply put, Putin bit off more than he could chew.

To actually occupy Ukraine, Putin would likely need to mobilize his entire active duty and reserve force, some three million troops (around 30x what he sent into Chechnya while having some reserve for national defense). He would also need to be able to handle the logistics for such a large operation - the Russian military doesn't have the trucks to do it and the roads are too narrow to handle frequent ambushes and vehicles running out of fuel.

In other words, he would need to appropriate civilian trucks for military supplies, expand roads leading into and through Ukraine, build pipelines to new military bases established just within Ukraine's border to ease fuel supply challenges, ramp up ammo and vehicle production, and probably implement rationing to minimize price surges i.e. inflation. They would need internment camps for hundreds of thousands or millions of POWs and protestors. It would look like WW3 in Russia for at least a year or two, maybe a decade, and then they'd have to endure decades more of brutal insurgency as Western-backed guerrillas continue trying to take back their country.

Putin's only realistic move right now is to try to capture Zelenskyy and the Ukranian parliament MPs (and their families) to try to force them into a ceasefire agreement where they agree to give up Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea. If Russia can't pull that off, or the Ukranian politicians can't be pressured into agreeing, or they all die in airstrikes/shelling, it is almost certain that Russians will not be willing to suffer what would be required of them to take and hold the entirety of Ukraine. This would almost certainly lead to eventual Russian loss with Ukraine retaking all captured territories.",8245a3a598008a40de62c57285501e8d59a612fb,True,False,,,,,0,1646246085,,0,{},hz2xp42,False,t3_t4ri79,False,True,t1_hz2ahw8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4ri79/four_ways_the_war_in_ukraine_might_end_although/hz2xp42/,1646246107,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646217285.0

From what I understand, my understanding being limited despite having spent many months reading about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian militias, foremost the Azov Battalion, stood for the bulk of the Ukrainian resistence in 2014. 

Since then, the state has recruited many militias into the official state-funded Ukranian forces, which is another reason we see less independent militias fighting. Notably, the Azov Battalion has opted to remain independent. 

I suspect one reason that reporting from the Azov Battalion is lacking is that this battalion has been affiliated with Nazis (I am aware far from all members of the Azov Battalion are Nazis/neo-Nazis). As we know, Putin is accusing Ukraine of being run by Nazis. It is therefore in Ukraine's interest to show that this is not the case, which could be a reason few people are reporting on the Azov Battalion.",5d5fd5ae03d303ae8d60cb775f8670888b23812f,True,False,,,,,0,1646241208,,0,{},hz2kuga,False,t3_t51lhh,False,True,t1_hz2ea27,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t51lhh/why_arent_we_seeing_more_reports_of_civilian/hz2kuga/,1646241218,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646212408.0

True but there is no shortage of gas in Russia either. Russia is an energy superpower, while yes Ukraine's additional gas reserves would be great but the world is already moving towards renewables. Also, what good is this gas if you can't sell it to the world? I don't buy the argument of 'Yes Men' generals because the Russian General Staff is a top notch, second, Putin is no dumb a\*\* and is a veteran of three wars. He can make his decisions himself. 

&gt;Leave Ukraine alone for another 50 years and they’ll enter NATO, get a membership in the EU, attract foreign investment and develop their gas infrastructure.

Ukraine was no way near getting a NATO or EU membership. It was a corrupt sh\*\* hole with extremely corrupt institutions with an active war in two regions which automatically rules it out of EU and NATO. There were no major reforms that were being pushed to actually fix its inherent structural problems. I know now we are looking at Ukraine with rose colored glasses and how it was the perfect democratic country, but come on. Zelensky himself was backed and got elected because of an oligarch, of course we don't talk about it anymore and we think of Ukraine as a paradise before this war.

I would separate these two thoughts. Putin launched the invasion based on what appears to be faulty intelligence and bad assumptions about Ukrainian resolve and political unification. Intelligent, shrewd people make mistakes *all the time.* Iraq? Afghanistan? Vietnam? In hindsight it's very easy to point out the flaws and false assumptions, but you don't know that before you make the gamble. 

Let's game out a little scenario here. Let's say 10 days ago Putin launches his invasion. Ukraine is caught more off guard and Russians manage to actually hit a lot of command and control and disrupt comms across the country. The VDV troops actually hold the airport and the decapitation works. Regional commanders, seeing Kiev has fallen and reports of Russian troops in the rear advancing at lightning speeds, decide ""fuck this, let's surrender."" Major portions of Ukraine fall in 24-96 hours and Putin basically pulls off a fait accompli and sidesteps the worst of the sanctions. 

Sounds ridiculous now, but only with the benefit of hindsight. How did the Kremlin get this so wrong? We'll probably not know for another 20-30 years. Maybe the GRU is far more corrupt than we thought. Maybe the Kremlin was far too optimistic (this happens all the time!). Maybe the Ukrainian political situation was truly fraught and divided and portions of the gov wanted to surrender and Zelensky managed to rally them around the flag. There's a lot of contingencies here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He had Ukraine exactly where he wanted, sh\*\* scared and the West bending over backward to accommodate him. Yet he still launched this invasion. Like WHY?

I don't think this is true either. Putin basically had a Ukraine that was hurtling towards joining the EU / NATO. It honestly was a de facto NATO partner, getting more weapons, more aid, and more competent at fighting in the field. The Ukrainians and NATO did *not offer any compromise.* 

Putin's strategy from 2014 - 2020 was the kind of coercive diplomacy that we often see from the Kremlin. It failed and after Zelensky took a hardline against Russia, military action became far more likely. I know this is a long post, but I think it's critical that when our adversaries make strategic blunders, we have to assume at least some degree of rationality.

- The Ukrainian military has asked not to report actions taken by Ukrainian forces to maintain security.   This war is a war of numbers and of propaganda. Dead civilians do not necessarily make good news for Ukrainian morale and it is hard to get objective information, as governments tends to be very selective about the information they provide in a war.

- Contrary to the current trope of *""Putin stupid, Russian soldier stupid, Russian generals stupid""* tank/infantry units has tactics to deal with insurgents and resistance fighters. As such it is not as in Hollywood movies or video games, where you go into stealth mode, sneak to a unsuspecting tank and blow it up and then getting the victory screen. These kind of attacks of the ""lets go!"" style tend to end quite quickly in a hail of machine guns. You need weapons, training with weapons, basic training and leadership to form a civilian resistance. This does not happen with the press of a button. Even if you have the motivation to resist, you may not have the opportunity.

- While no one doubts the heroic intentions of armchair warriors and ""Gravy Seals"", actually going against an even superficially trained tank / infantry without equal training and force requires insane amounts of conviction, desperation or stupidity. Looking at the history of occupation not all cities resisted until they were quasi-nuked, many simply put up token resistance and then accepted occupation.

Also, in many developing countries there is a sense that they have nothing left to lose. They are already so poor and oppressed that they'd rather die than continue living like that. Those extra motivations don't necessarily come into play as much in a developed country where people have little or no religious zeal and do have a lot to lose.   


But, Ukrainians have already rebelled against their government before and brought in a democratically elected government, so its hard to say how far they are willing to go. There's a difference between overthrowing an arrogant president, and a thousand riot police, and turning major cities to rubble fighting an insurgency.   


The question will be, what does Putin plan to do with Ukraine? There's no way he can expect a puppet government to last. The Ukrainians will likely just overthrow it the way they did less than a decade ago. Any puppet government would need tens of thousands of highly armed police to put down riots like they do in Moscow, but where would they get that equipment and a motivated (brainwashed) police force? On the other hand, I don't see how Russian forces can occupy Ukraine permanently. There aren't enough forces, especially now that they are taking relatively heavy losses, they would be stretched way to thin along the rest of the NATO line, Georgia, etc.   


Its really hard to say. As long as the Ukrainian leaders are alive and there are professional soldiers fighting Russian troops, I think the Ukrainians will continue to fight.

The only way it makes sense to me is that Putin actually drank his own Kool-Aid about the unpopularity of the Ukrainian government. Planned a messy issue on the border to obscure blame, followed by a quick (mostly) bloodless military advance to install a new Russian backed government. If not supported by most Ukrainians, then at least greeted with apathy.

But the semi-plausible deniability vanished when the western intelligence started screaming from the rooftops that there was going to be an invasion. Putin still pulled the trigger without having that cover, so it is straight forward aggression. Which might have ended less badly if the Ukrainians hadn't fought. 

Now he is committed and all options are bad. To win militarily it seems clear the Russians need to actually start utilizing more force (already happening). Widespread use of artillery and airstrikes against any and all resistance. Residential areas be damned like in the Second Chechen War. Cut off city centers and just pound the defenders. Worked in Grozny, but you ended up with a flattened city needing to be rebuilt from scratch. I cannot imagine rebuilding a war torn Ukraine was a goal for the invasion. But I don't see any other outcome here.

Either way, what I'd say is, I think people are underestimating the influence of social media in this conflict. Even within just the past 10 years, the world has gotton more and more online and connected. 

The division in the US is a perfect example of how social networking echo chambers are forming (again a recent phenomenon), and the point is, as a consequence it is incredibly difficult to 'kill' certain ideas and beliefs, irregardless of how much you might try to do so from the top down. Even if the Russian's go full facist, it is easy to bypass most mechanisms given modern technology and a little help from external supporters. 

Hence, in my opinion at least, I cannot see how the Ukrainian will to fight will diminish any time soon - their echo chambers suggest their fight is a universally righteous one. What would actually concern me more than that is actually whether the NATO powers will make 'behind door' deals, to give up Ukraine or huge parts of Ukraine in exchange for peace (I doubt it would happen, but it's still a possibility), at least than the will to fight of the Ukrainian people.

My core point is, given social media, I think 'history' in these scenarios will move a lot faster than it did in the past. The messaging, the unity of the region, and the external support in Iraq was poor, attempting to annex Ukraine is a totally different beast.

I think you're correct- the moment Putin decided to invade, Ukraine lost. It may be days, weeks, months, but the Ukrainian state as we know is likely to be dismantled. Ukraine, however, can still deny Russia victory.   
  
There is likely no way to negotiate a good deal for Ukraine- but does Ukraine truly have an incentive to even accept a bad deal? We know that Russia has compiled extensive lists of Ukrainians who need to be killed or ""re-educated""- including Ukrainians who served in the armed forces in any capacity. These lists likely include members of Ukraine's democratic government.   
  
For negotiators, the decision is to die on the battlefield or die to secret police after signing a peace treaty that Russia inevitably breaks or stretches to the point of meaninglessness (See the Minsk Agreements or the Budapest memorandum).

* regime change (dubious feasibility, see below)
* pledge never to join NATO
* territorial concessions directly annexed to Russia (land connection to Crimea, all predominantly Russian speaking areas, all ethnic Russian areas, etc.)
* recognition of DPR and LPR independence (probably with territorial concessions of the full provinces to the puppet states)
* partition of Ukraine between Russia/puppet state and neutered landlocked rump state which will likely turn to the EU

No one but Putin knows exactly what is minimally acceptable to him, but depending on how much pressure he's under from the combined effects of sanctions, internal dissent, loss of prestige/condemnation, and military losses, he may find one or more of the above factors acceptable and seek to negotiate with Ukraine. 

I know it seems like Ukraine would never accept any of these things, but if it means keeping their independence, I think they might consider some of them. Zelensky has implied that he might be open to ""neutrality.""

I'm also not sure how realistic regime change is, by itself, because Russia doesn't have anywhere near the number of troops deployed to fully occupy Ukraine, and it seems to me that any puppet government Putin installs would be so weak and unpopular that it would require a sizeable permanent garrison of Russian troops just to stay in power.

Does not matter, atleast according to me

There have been issues but the Russians are moving, they may have slowed down but they have not stopped.

They are reacting and mostly relying on hit/run tactics which again slows down the Russians, does not stop them.

Again this could have felt like a now or never endeavor as the Russian economy was already collapsing and the population has been in decline for some time.   Couple that with the growing independence of Ukraine and it might feel like a ticking clock in the Kremlin.

Russia has created conflicts in the Donbass region for some time now which has prevented Ukraine form joining NATO and as an attempt to scare off western gas investments/drilling (Shell and Exxon), but that progress was slowly continuing regardless.  Putin's goal is strategic military defense positioning from the west and to secure natural resources like oil pipelines and water resources for Crimea (that Ukraine shut off access too).  Ukraine has been investing in its own natural gas infrastructure for some time now, and the Russian troops arriving at their border coincide with those advances as they know that once Ukraine is close to tapping into that natural gas that it's ability to join NATO will be expedited.  Ukraine didn't just find a little bit of natural gas deposits off its coast.. it found a significant amount which would make it a massive exporter...  it just wanted a little western assistance to .

The port of Sevastopol in Crimea which Russia now controls is the most Geo-strategic ports that the Russian's now control.  When they took this years ago it halted the exploration of those gas reserves that Ukraine found on the coast.  Russia is now invading the mainland because of the other natural gas found inland.  But it's expensive to hold this region while not yet making money on natural gas...  cause all fresh water came into this region from Ukraine and that has stopped.  Russia is essentially spending a ton of money trucking in supplies to this region and other parts of their expansions and it's a money pit.  They need to get to work on drilling for Ukraines natural gas.

Russia spent billions on Crimea (including the new bridge linking the peninsula to Russia proper), a sunk cost it will never get back and came at a cost to wider investment.

I doubt the majority of policy-makers and strategists (besides a few of the most hawkish) actually want that. What they want is for the obvious potential of that to factor into a Russian withdrawal as imminently as possible.

If it becomes clear that - in the event of a conventional Ukrainian defeat - the Ukrainian populace are willing to undertake a significant partisan insurgency, and are well armed with the MANPADS and ATGMs flooding into Ukraine from the West, then the cost to Russia in lives and materiel will be apparent without having to endure 10 years of it. Russia won't have to redo Afghanistan to figure out that they're in an unworkable situation.

&gt; but how much sense does it make for Ukraine to not want to negotiate their way out of this war basically asap?

They clearly do - hence why they attended peace talks with a Russian government that clearly had no intention of offering reasonable terms. The problem is that if all Russia is willing to consider at this point is what basically amounts to a complete Ukrainian surrender, then there really isn't much to negotiate for or about. Besides, they've already signed the Minsk Agreements with Russia (not to mention the 1996 Budapest Memorandum) - that Putin has just completely ignored. There is no point in negotiating a peace with an actor that will immediately restart hostilities as soon as they see the opportunity.

&gt; Isn't their negotiating position bound to weaken by the day?

In terms of the tactical situation within Ukraine? Yes - unless they pull of some truly remarkable counter-attacks, or the Russian military collapses internally.

However, in the wider strategic picture, it's very different. Russia and Ukraine are not playing with the same hand of cards here - Putin has an exceptional level of control over the Russian state, but even he cannot maintain an extensive deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine for too long - both financially and politically. Russian troops being sent back in bodybags by the truckload will turn the populace against a war that is already contentious, and tanks/IFVs/APCs/helicopters/etc being blown up each day (even in an insurgency situation) are losses that Russia cannot afford to sustain or replace. If the sanctions continue to tighten, the effect of this is amplified by an enormous degree.

If Ukraine can hold onto it's big cities, and make Russia pay terribly to take them, then it can drag the war out for weeks, and maybe months longer. For Putin it becomes harder and harder to sustain the Russian deployments each day. He is burning through political goodwill and cash at a ridiculous rate - in that respect, the Ukrainian negotiating position gets stronger and stronger, so long as they can continue to bog the Russians down.",a742530c28243d1e6f318eb0f425f1b52e638d77,True,False,,,,,0,1646233635,,0,{},hz21hnt,False,t3_t4zm8w,False,True,t1_hz1wxch,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4zm8w/ukraine_megathread_march_2/hz21hnt/,1646233649,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646204835.0

Not necessarily. If the Ukrainian leadership thinks that they have a chance to break the Russian forces completely, or hold out longer than the Russians can, it makes sense for them to continue the conflict because they have the potential to retake Crimea and the Donbas in the process.

Putin is not a novice.  He watched the USSR fail in part because of Afghanistan and his own rise to power is at least partially because of Russia's failure in the first Chechnan war.  He cemented his power with the success of the 2nd Chechnan war.  Subsequently times when he has used force: Georgia, Ukraine/Crimea, and Syria he has achieved the aims set out.

The most likely answer, and the probability, while low, is not zero, is a tactical nuclear weapon use. Let's say, over a relatively empty field. I've been thinking that if there is a nuclear weapon  exploding over a farm that kills a Ukrainian family of 4 and a dozen cows, will anyone risk escalation towards nuclear war in the millions?

I found this [CSIS piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLWYN1jkmXc) particularly gleeful at planning to support and supply an insurgency in Ukraine in the same mold as supporting the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan against the Soviets. They sort of hand-waved the question: ""well, what if Russia tossed a cruise missile Poland's way and hit one of the big weapons transport/cache, will everyone activate Article 5?"". I mean, for a short time after the Afghanistan withdrawals, everyone was asking ""how to do counterinsurgency?"". Now all of the sudden, ""let's make an insurgency happen"". Well, I do hope everyone remembers that even ultimately victorious, the Afghans and Vietnamese insurgents took very disproportionate casualties. They could do it, because their families had 4, 6, or 8 children. Ukrainian, and for that matter Russian families, barely have 2.

Looping back to the nuclear weapon question, the tentative answer is ""it will shock everyone and violate a taboo"". I'm a perversely optimistic sort so I'll say that it may actually benefit other nuclear armed states: imagine a stalemate like Korea or a quagmire like Vietnam, Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, etc ... you name it. If indeed a nuclear weapon can be exploded over Ukraine and then Ukraine capitulate, well, the next quagmire a nuclear-armed state stumbled onto may well be resolved with a nuclear blast.",9c48bf2d551dd306221d764b574103f4431c6d1f,True,False,,,,,0,1646226992,,0,{},hz1n67p,False,t3_t4zm8w,False,False,t3_t4zm8w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4zm8w/ukraine_megathread_march_2/hz1n67p/,1646227008,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646198192.0

I often wonder if Putin wouldn't like some kind of ""reset"" with the oligarchy that shrinks their affiliation with the West.  They pump a lot of money overseas that could theoretically be valuable kept inside of Russia and used for its internal economic development vs. London townhouses, yachts, Manhattan apartments, and offshore investment funds.

I really wanna be wrong, but I'm going to take a random guess and say that Putin and his higher-ups are eventually going to win the conventional war (not counting insurgencies). I expect that somehow, the Russian military is going to get its act together, go for its heavy artillery and air supremacy, and start bombing cities and towns in siege warfare. 

Ukraine has put up a great fight and has exceeded expectations when taking on Russia. But against Russia's innate advantage of equipment and air superiority, that's a tough battle to overcome. Analysts, spectators, guessers, and intel suggests that Kyiv may fall within days or a week, and the war will continue for months with Ukraine having few opportunities for counterattacks as they continue to fall back.

It's only a matter of time before Russia brings out the big guns and indiscriminately brute-force its way into Ukraine.

I personally want a scenario where Kyiv never falls as well as the important Ukrainian cities. However, that country is essentially facing off the 2nd/3rd most powerful country on the entire planet. However, they need more than just ATGMs and Javelins. Hopefully, NATO just donates powerful equipment like Patriots and NATO artillery of sorts, but that's a pipe dream. 

My hope is this:  Russia is in a race against sanctions. It needs to try and see if the benefits of achieving its objectives (some or even all, I'm purposely being vague on what these objectives are) are higher than the costs of the sanctions and war. And to do that, time needs to be on their side. Unfortunately, time isn't on their side. The Russian invasion puts Russia in many disadvantages from poor morale to negative public opinion to quick sanctions to diplomacy penalties. If Ukraine somehow holds out for much longer than what analysts say (I think 6 months? I could be wrong), then maybe they can come out largely intact. 

If I was the Ukrainian president, I would find a way to keep Ukraine intact. This would mean giving up Crimea and recognizing the breakaway regions to the east, but Ukraine gets big bonuses like joining NATO and the EU.

Pretty much, but the issue for Russia in Ukraine is worse than that. Their geopolitical goal is to absorb Ukrainians into a greater Russian state, but in invading Ukraine they just created the greatest impetus for a fiercely independent and anti-Russian Ukrainian national identity.  And their economy....

In perpetuity doesn't mean forever forever, but means ""longer than Russia is able to maintain an offensive war and occupation"". Western Ukraine will be receiving arms, supplies, fighters etc from western countries theoretically in perpetuity. If Ukrainians decide to keep fighting, they can. Of course Ukrainian resolve to keep fighting is also not a given.

Both of these have a higher than anticipated probability of occurring. 

First, Putin rules by fear, and the population seems to be bucking that fear. Hard to tell if we've got the tipping point yet though. Or when we do hit it. If that happens, it's very likely a crease fire and then peace treaty will be negotiated pretty quickly. 

Second, Western Ukraine has basically been untouched and is mobilizing huge forces (I suspect this is not being publicized). We're talking probably 200k+ fighting soldiers. Where do they hit, how well are they equipped, and their tactics are huge questions. I suspect they won't be purely defensive forces. If they do get some decisive victories, it'll heavily demoralize already frustrated Russian soldiers. We could see a larger portion of the invasion force surrender.

[],False,,cretan_bull,,,[],,,,text,t2_93kjo,False,False,"So, the general consensus is that Kyiv is probably going fall in the next few weeks. Certainly the Ukrainians will be pushed back and the city will be surrounded.

I realize that trying to read the tea leaves is looked down upon, especially when the prediction seems wildly optimistic, but there's also the perspective that a concrete prediction can be proven to have been accurate or inaccurate after the fact. So I'm making my prediction: I think the attack that right now is moving to Kyiv from the NW is going to be a spectacular military disaster that will go down in the history books as one of the most ill-conceived and poorly executed military operations in history. I think Russia will be lucky if the attack gets past Hostomel. I think they won't get anything larger than a battalion-sized force south of Makariv, and anything they do get through there will be destroyed in short order.

The reasons I think this come down to three main factors: logistics, morale, and the terrain.

Let's start with the terrain, since that also drives the logistics. From the Belarusian border to Ivankiv the route of approach is a single road. At Ivankiv the road network opens up a bit, but Russia seems to only be using the south-east road, the P02, at this time. There's a junction 18 km along that road, which splits up into two roads: one going east to Dymer, which again splits into two routes to the north of Kyiv, one through Vyshhorod and one to Hostomel; and the western route which goes Bordyanka, Makariv, and around to the south of the city, also providing a few access roads to the west of the city. This terrain is a mix of rural, semi-rural and suburban areas, with scattered woodland. 

Russia's avenues of approach are seriously restricted. Rasputitsa has started. That means they absolutely must stick to this very small number of roads, which in turn means they have no choice to dribble platoon-sized elements down fixed avenues of approach into ambushes. A 70km long convoy might look impressive in terms of volume of men and material, but it's of no value if it can't get into action. All it does is impede logistics, burn fuel and eat food. And as vehicles are picked off by ambushes and airstrikes, it will further constrict the roadway, making resupply and concentrating force at the van even more difficult.

The Ukrainian forces around Kyiv are very well equipped with ATGMs. They might not have had them in enough number to arm all the militia, but that's more out of a plenitude of manpower. Convoys have already started arrived from Poland with yet more supply. Yesterday, we also saw an impressive pair of ambushes by Ukrainian forces: a combat force of at least company-size destroyed at Makariv and what was probably a logistics convoy destroyed at Borodyanka. What I find especially notable about this is that it indicates what are likely professional Ukrainian soldiers are continuing to operate far from the city, likely as relatively small light infantry forces, rather than giving in to the temptation of falling back on urban areas and settling in for a siege. I see no reason why this will not continue, especially if Russian forces are not able to concentrate enough force to make such ambushes impractical.

On to logistics. Russia's logistics are largely based around operating from a railhead and their ability to supply by road is seriously limited. There are railways around Kyiv Russia could be using: to the west there's a railway from Belarus to Korosten and then into the city; and to the east it goes Chernihiv, Nizhyn, Bobrovytsya, Kyiv. Nizhyn and Bobrovytsya are in Russian control, or at least have reported the presence of Russian forces in the area. So it's not impossible that a Russian force to the east of the city could be resupplied by rail from Bryansk and Kursk Oblasts, though that would still necessitate securing hundreds of kilometers of railway from partisan activity, in areas which absolutely have not yet been pacified. Chernihiv is still firmly in Ukrainian control so that shorter route definitely can't be used. But the main attack on Kyiv is to the west of the Dnieper, and to all evidence Russia shows absolutely no sign of securing Korosten and establishing a railhead before moving on the city.

Back in the very first days of the invasion, when Russia was only committing a small fraction of its forces and advancing down many separate avenues of approach, there were still countless examples of forces going black on POL, having to try refueling at civilian petrol stations or loot for food. Many of those examples weren't in the Kyiv area of operations, but it's reasonable to assume that logistical capabilities are comparable. Since then, logistics convoys have taken steady attrition, logistical demands are much greater since so much additional force has been committed, and the force attacking Kyiv is stuck in a 70km-long traffic jam right on top of the MSR, reducing the logistical capacity of that route to roughly zero for as long as it takes to get those forces off the road. Which, again, is an issue in itself because of the Rasputitsa; it's no good clearing the road if the entire BTG gets stuck in mud. And clearing the road becomes far more complicated when vehicles start running out of fuel while on it, say, because they've been idling for days or it didn't start with a full tank because they sold most of it on the black market in Belarus.

And it's not just POL, food, and ammunition. Russia has recently shown a trend of being more willing to use artillery, which it was reluctant to do in the initial attack. Trying to siege a city, or even just suppress the forces outside the city with artillery will consume a huge amount of logistical capacity. They might be able to manage a few impressive-looking rocket barrages, but they won't be able to sustain it.

Kyiv's logistics are concerning in terms of the humanitarian crisis. But the roads to the south are very good and until and unless Russia can cut those off, there is no reason arms, ammunition and rations will not be able to get to the city from Poland.

Which brings us to morale. I do not think I need to elaborate on the reasons Russian morale will be poor to begin. But when those soldiers have been stuck in a traffic jam for days, with little or no resupply, and then they have to maneuver past hundreds of wrecks of burned-out vehicles and piles of dead bodies, they see vehicles in front of them get destroyed by ATGMs, and then they're told they have to advance in the van on a narrow road, with no way to maneuver, where they know with 100% certainty they're going to die, I think merely poor morale will become catastrophic. I anticipate mass revolt, desertion, and surrender. There's already been sign of that, where reportedly marines revolted when they were ordered to make an amphibious assault on Odessa, and I would expect the troops moving to attack Kyiv to have far worse morale for a multitude of reasons.

Finally, even if I'm wrong and Russia, somehow, manages to siege Kyiv with sufficient force and keep that force well supplied, I still don't think they can take the city. The history of sieges in modern warfare tells us that short of nuclear weapons, it's not possible to destroy the ability of a defender in an urban center to resist with just long-range fires and air strikes. What it can do is cause an immense amount of civilian casualties and lead to surrender; whether that happens depends on the defenders' morale. My assessment is that Ukrainians' morale is extremely high and an overwhelming proportion of the civilians not only support resistance but are actually making themselves combatants. I think that even if Russia turned Kyiv into rubble, something I very much hope will not happen, the defenders would still resist. And taking a city of Kyiv's size against that sort of resistance is the sort of thing that can cost hundreds of thousands of casualties, something we haven't seen since WWII.",753d5efe08f78822d1946b2ddb78cf5f94dd1cbf,True,False,,,,,0,1646200227,,0,{},hz0lbab,False,t3_t48e0p,False,True,t3_t48e0p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t48e0p/ukraine_megathread_march_1/hz0lbab/,1646200238,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646171427.0

Here are my guesses in that direction.  

Russia will end up with a defiant and economically stalled Russia in a similar (but not all the way) state that Iran is in now. Someone will buy Russia's oil and gas, and the war means that the prices are in their favor. The gas station economy is even stronger here, but now the convenience store side of the business will wither away even more. China wins here as Russia will need them more than they need Russia. 

Putin and his advisors are famously former Soviet intelligence officers. And to be blunt about they do not understand, value, or consider the economic side of things as strongly as we would expect a national leader would. In their minds the economy serves the state and allows the aims of the state to be met, and not the other way around. Just look at the economic diversification and development in Russia for the last twenty years. 

For example the technology portion of the economy is something that happened organically and wasn't fostered by the state. And it was seen as valuable to Putin for hacking and information warfare. A better and more insightful leader would have tried to make a Slavic Silicon Valley in Russia. But instead it was used as a weapon and now withers away like the rest of the Russian civil economy under sanctions. 

Sanctions are ineffective mostly because the countries the targeted country has already factored them in, and or must be defiant in the face of them in order to not appear weak. They are effective in that the ability of the targeted nation to repeat the infraction becomes degraded, but it will not stop what has already happened. Sanctions are effective as a deterrent I believe to people who may consider doing something that would trigger them, and don't because of fear of them. But most every study I have seen on sanctions only looks at those that have already been implemented and looks to see if the targeted nation changes their behavior. A foolish way to examine something in my opinion. 

I do not expect much to change politically in Russia as the former intel men in charge would never have made such risky moves without having confidence in their position domestically. The oligarchs have been famously brought to heel, the worldly elites in the big cities are small and didn't like Putin anyway, and the vast majority of the population consumes the mass media designed to protect the state.",5a28c1c4062b595ad6687274612f4853766a98a1,True,False,,,,,0,1646199417,,0,{},hz0jxtp,True,t3_t4ri79,False,True,t1_hz0gm4s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4ri79/four_ways_the_war_in_ukraine_might_end_although/hz0jxtp/,1646199435,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646170617.0

Every gun battle was a suicide mission for the resistance but they were willing to trade the entire squad for one dead American. And the IED's could be deployed without losing anyone. Was just a matter of bleeding the invaders. While every death is a tragedy, these were low numbers compared to WWII but the cost in treasure... Holy shit.

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"Key enablers are often in short supply, and when you lose them, you degrade the effectiveness of your entire force. It doesn't matter if you have three mechanized brigades stacked up and ready to roll; if you hit a blown out bridge and you lack an assault bridging capacity on that front, you aren't moving forward until one can be shifted from another front. During that time of course, the unit you're borrowing a bridging company from loses that capability in turn.

In the US military, for instance, you only have about one bridging company for each division. So losing that bridging company is more impactful than losing one company of infantry, for instance. If you lose that infantry company, you have dozens more that can take its place. Lose that bridging company though, and now your entire division lacks the ability to perform a river crossing.

The same logic applies for all sorts of other enablers. For instance, when you hear reports that Russians are transmitting on open frequencies using long-range HF transmitters, that kind of terrible commsec is hard to wrap your head around until you also see all these images of destroyed communications vehicles and retrans vehicles. Radio repeaters are like links in a chain; it doesn't matter how sturdy the rest of the chain is, you only need to cut one to make it fail. As Ukrainians have managed to successfully attack communications/retrans vehicles, they've undermined Russian long-range comms and degraded the communications capabilities of much larger forces.

Normally, most of these enablers are kept fairly well protected and well to the rear because they represent single points of failure. With the invasion force apparently overextending itself though, these enablers have apparently found themselves in the midst of high intensity fighting where maneuver forces should have been bearing the brunt. Based on the volume of verifiable enabler losses, it seems as though they are taking losses that are disproportionately high.",68216b7f2e4b706bfde04dedc10690b00b7d1ac5,True,False,,,,,0,1646196090,,0,{},hz0dto9,False,t3_t2zf5q,False,True,t1_hyzslt0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2zf5q/how_much_of_ukraines_current_success_do_you_think/hz0dto9/,1646196104,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646167290.0

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"&gt; The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces has spurred Europe’s worst security crisis in decades. But while most analysis is rightly focused on the immediate situation, it is equally important to forecast the war’s multiple possible trajectories and outcomes. Anticipating the uncertainties that this war will bring is a critical step toward successfully navigating its possible consequences. 

&gt; Although the situation in Ukraine is fluid, the scenarios outlined here offer four plausible ways in which the conflict might end. Even the rosiest of these possibilities—which we’ve dubbed the “Miracle on the Dnipro”—is fraught with danger. The United States, its transatlantic allies and partners, and indeed the entire world now likely face a difficult period of sustained contestation with Russia.

This article is attempting to look at the current situation and extrapolate what the future will hold. The authors are professionals in their field and the Atlantic Council is a professional think tank that deals with security and defense issues full time. 

There are several things in this article that I strongly disagree with. I am an anonymous person on Reddit, while they are professionals with titles, so Two examples: 

1. ""For now, the United States and other NATO allies have rejected implementing a no-fly zone—but that calculus could change if Russia continues to escalate its bombardment of civilians."" This calculus will not change as no one wants to start a military conflict between Nato and Russia. A very basic thing that I find difficult to believe that educated adults think is a good idea. 

2. ""Early evidence suggests that this war is turning in the West’s favor for three reasons."" This war is decidedly not turning in the West's favor or Ukraine's. Russia tried to recreate their success in Crimea 2014, they smelled their own Hybrid Warfare farts for so long they actually thought they had a workable doctrine. We can all see that it failed spectacularly. 

However if you look at the progress of the Russian ground offensives versus those of Germany in the first part of WW2, or the US in Iraq in 2003; you will see that they are taking ground at a rate comparable with what would be expected of a professional armour campaign. I suspect that they will replace some commanders and revert back to traditional combined arms war fighting, and drop the silly hail mary stuff that has resulted in the clown show evident so far.",7eb1b42c40dd8a6da23713d6226c56045aa4b8a0,True,False,,,,,0,1646196049,,0,{},hz0dqqr,True,t3_t4ri79,False,True,t3_t4ri79,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4ri79/four_ways_the_war_in_ukraine_might_end_although/hz0dqqr/,1646196061,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646167249.0

&gt;Justin Bronk, aviation expert at the British RUSI think tank, said he suspected a possible lack of precision guided munitions (PGMs) available to Russian pilots may also be a factor in the attack delay.  
  
Russian air strikes in Syria often relied on unguided missiles, he said.  
  
""This not only indicates a very limited familiarity with PGMs among most Russian fighter crews, but also reinforces the widely accepted theory that the Russian air-delivered PGM stockpile is very limited,"" he wrote on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE300/PE330/RAND\_PE330.pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE300/PE330/RAND_PE330.pdf)

&gt;Russian military planners probably lack confidence that their stockpiles of conventional  
precision-guided missiles can be counted on to accomplish  
this mission while retaining significant reserves. Moscow  
only began large-scale procurement of conventional  
precision munitions relatively recently, and a combination  
of production bottlenecks and export sales constrains its  
ability to stockpile them in large quantities.71

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Finally, modern military equipment  
and weapons, including long-range precision munitions,  
are neither deployed nor stockpiled in large quantities. As a  
consequence, despite its potential to swiftly seize territory  
in areas such as the Baltics, Russia, in addition to risking  
escalation to nuclear war, might struggle if the conflict  
drags on and NATO can bring its vastly larger resources to  
bear

Furthermore:

&gt;This not only indicates a very limited familiarity with PGMs among most Russian fighter crews, but also reinforces the widely accepted theory that the Russian air-delivered PGM stockpile is very limited. Years of combat operations in Syria will have further depleted that stockpile, and may mean that the bulk of the 300 VKS fixed wing combat aircraft massed around Ukraine have only unguided bombs and rockets to draw on for ground-attack sorties. This, combined with the lack of targeting pods to spot and identify battlefield targets from a safe distance, means that the VKS fixed wing pilots’ capacity to provide close air support for their forces is limited. As a result, the VKS leadership may be reluctant to commit the bulk of their potential striking power against Ukrainian troops before political approval is granted to employ unguided munitions to bombard Ukrainian-held urban areas. This indiscriminate form of air attack was standard practice for Russian and Syrian Air Force operations over Aleppo and Homs, and unfortunately is likely to be employed by the VKS over Ukraine in the coming days.  
  
Lack of PGMs, however, is not a sufficient explanation for the overall lack of VKS fixed wing activity. The relatively modern avionics on most of their strike platforms mean that even unguided bombs and rockets should still have been sufficient to inflict major damage on Ukrainian aircraft in their airbases. The VKS also have around 80 modern and capable Su-35S air superiority and 110 multirole Su-30SM(2) fighters, which could conduct OCA and DCA sweeps. The inability to establish air superiority, therefore, cannot be purely explained by a lack of suitable PGMs.  
  
Another potential explanation is that the VKS are not confident in their capacity to safely deconflict large-scale sorties with the activity of Russian ground-based SAMs operated by the Ground Forces. Friendly-fire incidents by ground-based SAM units have been a problem for Western and Russian air forces alike in multiple conflicts since 1990. Running joint engagement zones in which combat aircraft and SAM systems can engage enemy forces simultaneously in a complex environment without friendly-fire incidents is hard; it requires close inter-service cooperation, excellent communications and regular training to master. So far, Russian forces have shown extremely poor coordination across the board, from basic logistics tasks, to coordination of airborne assaults with ground forces activity and arranging air defence cover for columns on the move.",a4fbf3900fdc9123a46c7cbc5d8f4110697abae2,True,False,,,,,0,1646191229,,0,{},hz03jqi,False,t3_t4hkby,False,True,t1_hz00gnu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t4hkby/disparity_in_russian_infantry_equipment_in_ukraine/hz03jqi/,1646191243,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646162429.0

[],False,,darawk,,,[],,,,text,t2_3sked,False,False,"&gt; You are addicted to the idea that your original idea is right, and you are not carefully evaluating the feedback you've solicited.

This certainly could be right. I am convinced that my original idea as stated is probably not ideal.

&gt; putin_my_ass is telling you so as well.

Yes he has been saying that, but he was also particularly wrong in his criticisms of my idea. The reasons he offered were genuine and reasonable (originally), but they were just factually inaccurate. Other people absolutely brought up valid points, though.

&gt; I've looked over the thread again, and I don't see where you've been partially convinced your idea is wrong. The one reply you linked to above where you whole-heartedly agree with someone was about a tangential matter. 

I think you have to read that whole sub-thread in context. It was a point/counterpoint exchange. Originally someone said that this wasn't necessary because they already had sufficient supplies of e.g. NLAWs, which if true absolutely invalidates what I was saying. I responded however that those supplies may be overly centralized and inaccessible to a large majority of the population who would like to engage in the fight. Someone responded to *that* by saying that it may be the case that they had pre-emptively decentralized their supplies, so that this issue was moot. And I have no response to that, I think that very well may be the case, and if so, they absolutely shouldn't be trying to make improvised EFPs.

&gt; Which part of your initial idea do you now understand to be wrong?

A few things. One, I hadn't thought through the possibility that their existing supplies of military grade anti-tank weapons had already been thoroughly distributed throughout the country where they were likely to be needed. Two, I hadn't fully thought through the safety considerations for the specific explosives I chose. I mean, i've made them myself before, so I understand how dangerous they are, but citizens making them at scale in dense urban areas would probably be disastrous. I think they can be, and have been, used quite effectively by terrorist organizations in the past, so the idea does *work* in the literal sense, but it is likely not worth the risk as originally stated.

I think it's possible that a two stage system consisting of e.g. ANFO with the original primaries I recommended as blasting caps, kept wet and in small separated quantities could be workable, though. I think probably the reason it hasn't come to this over there yet is that they do still have quite sufficient supplies of anti-armor weapons in relation to the significance of armored vehicles on the battlefield at the moment. However, i'm concerned that that may change as Russia begins targeting munitions depots, which they have been increasingly doing.

I think it could be useful to the Ukrainians to have ready made and well distributed guides on how to make reasonably safe and effective improvised weapons with materials they have on hand. I certainly don't believe that my original comment accomplished that, or was even particularly close to it. My hope was that a dialog with ordinance experts could refine the basic outline into something more specific that had a reasonable safety profile relative to the potential rewards of doing it. Particularly as the invasion morphs into an occupation over the coming weeks, things like this seem like they will be necessary. Though perhaps the insurgency will be sufficiently well supplied by the NATO countries on Ukraine's borders that it's a non-issue.

These men seem very different from all of the others we have so far seen dead and captured fighting in Ukraine. 

50-80% of what you have seen is pure disinformation or propaganda from the Ukrainian side, and these fakes have been repeatedly refuted.  
For example like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/N\_N\_N/comments/t3ssk0/example\_of\_deep\_fakes\_circulating\_right\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/N_N_N/comments/t3ssk0/example_of_deep_fakes_circulating_right_now/)

Or remember how the Ukrainian border guards said: Russian warship, fuck you.  
Then they ""heroic"" accepted death. In fact, they all (86 people) surrendered to the Russians  
As a result, Ukraine will confirm this

[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t3elvw/snake\_island\_soldiers\_who\_told\_russian\_warship\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t3elvw/snake_island_soldiers_who_told_russian_warship_go/)

Or the famous ""Spirit of Kyiv"", which turned out to be another fake.  
Ukarina stated that she destroyed 29! airplanes and 29! helicopters. It's even funny. Ukraine are clinging to every opportunity to demonstrate their ""success"", if they actually destroyed 29 aircraft, the entire Internet would see these frames. But there are no these shots, because there are no 29 downed aircraft.  
The same applies to ""thousands of dead and hundreds of prisoners."" Where is the photo or video? there is nothing, there is only Ukrainian lies.  
The people you saw in the photo or video are not Russian military, they are either Ukrainian actors or DNR/LNR militias. That's why they're dressed in old shit.  
  
Ukraine really captured 4 Russian pilots and several Russian soldiers. All Russian soldiers involved in this conflict are well equipped by any standards. With the possible exception of some rear units.  
  
The second lie sounds like this: ""from the beginning, the Russians put forward cannon fodder, then tough guys.""  
  
In fact, in the first stage of the operation, Russia is trying to move forward as much as possible along the main strategic directions. At the same time, Russia used only a third of the forces located near the Ukrainian borders.  
When the advanced units achieve their goals, the second echelon will enter into action, the task of which is to liquidate the encircled forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

1) Ukraine realized that if they did not defend the Donbas, any possible armistice would mean they would lose it, like Polish planning before WW2 to defend exposed territory it gained from Germany rather than retreating to stronger river lines.

Russian logistics are poor.  They've got far fewer resupply vehicles, fuel tankers etc.  than an equivalent NATO unit does.  

They're reliant on rail transportation but the railway gauge that they use, is used by relatively few countries.  Ukraine isn't one of them.  BM-21 Grads got through a lot of bulky ammo in seconds and then need to be resupplied.  With about one trucks worth of ammo.  Which has to be handballed from the train on to the truck, driven to the front line, handballed off and then the truck can turn around.  They're ok up to about 45-90KM from a Russian gauge railhead.  After that things go South quickly.  

The carriages can change gauges but the engines can't.  So unless they can capture railway engines they're stuck.
