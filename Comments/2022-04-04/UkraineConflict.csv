These events are widespread and systemic. That indicates not just individual responsibility but command responsibility. Either the operational command is being negligent in controlling its troops, or it is directing them to commit these atrocities, either way both neglect and intent are indictable as war crimes and crimes against humanity.

But the trail goes higher than the operational command. Complaints have been made by the UN and it’s member states, and institutions also, to the Russian leadership. Yet the only response is denial. This in itself is both ridiculous and incriminating. Ridiculous because any armed force in armed conflict can commit war crimes and crime against humanity, therefore it is always prudent to seek details and at least investigate. Incriminating in that the continual outright denial may well be because the Russian leadership knows these atrocities are being undertaken, indeed it expects these to take place because they are what it wants, it just doesn’t want to openly admit what it’s troops are doing. The fact that there has been no indication that Russian Forces have ceased to commit grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions since complaints have been raised indicates that the highest levels of leadership accept the atrocious behaviour of its forces and may actually encourage and direct such atrocities; either way, negligence is no defence, it’s the same as directing criminal atrocities.

The conspiracy is huge, running to many hundreds, if not thousands. Then their are the individuals who actually killed, maimed, raped, looted, and committed the numerous individual crimes. Any war crime tribunal that undertakes investigation and prosecution for Putin’s War in Ukraine is going to have to be very well resourced and have a robust political backing.

Initially I had set out to list the war crimes, crimes against humanity and possible genocidal crimes Russian troops have been linked to in Ukraine since February 2022. To this is added the planning and execution of the crime of a war of aggression. The list of international crimes is so  long, one may just take whole sections of the Geneva Conventions ( Russia is party to most of these) and paste them into any article… it is easier to find the few crimes the Russians have not yet been linked to!

The fuck kind of revisionism is this? The fascist was a full on Hitler ally and collaborator.   
He was part of the Abwehr (Hitler's military intelligence organization) 

He was anti soviet, and very very nationalist. He's outright antisemitic.  
[His worshippers outright commit hate crimes against Jewish and Romani people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banderites)  


The fact that he spent two years in a political prisoner camp doesn't mean much when he was released in order to further help the Nazis. It just mean's that hes a nazi bootlicker that Hitler would have spat on because German Nazis don't actually see slavs as white.

These events are widespread and systemic. That indicates not just individual responsibility but command responsibility. Either the operational command is being negligent in controlling its troops, or it is directing them to commit these atrocities, either way both neglect and intent are indictable as war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Ridiculous because any armed force in armed conflict can commit war crimes and crime against humanity, therefore it is always prudent to seek details and at least investigate.
