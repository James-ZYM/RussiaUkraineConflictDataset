But what you’re saying is basically: “if my neighbor beat up his wife it’s not my problem”. Right?

Also, you really believe that for Libya Ghaddafi was a good thing? Or Milosevic was good for Serbia? 

What you’re saying is basically better leave dictators where they are to prevent additional killings. So in a parallel universe we can have a genocidal Hitler and who cares while he stays in his own borders.

Then propaganda… do you believe that I think that Saddam had WMD? Of course no one believe that, and as a westerner I can clearly say that it was a disgrace, but still, good things happened in most of these wars.

Propaganda is a different thing, propaganda is believing that Chechens bombed an apartment building or that Ukraine is a Nazi regime (because dude… Russia???) and then have a justification to LEVEL cities with artillery.

Because when the Moscow military distribution center supply clerk skims 20L off the 1000L shipment, then the Obninsk supply clerk skims 40L off the 980L shipment (because he's a little farther from the capital), then the Kaluga supply clerk skims 60L off the 940L shipment, then the Bryansk clerk skims 60L off the 880L shipment, then the Gomel clerk skims 60L off the 820L shipment, then the Mazyr clerk skims 60L off the 760L shipment, then the Korosten supply dump clerk skims 120L off the 700L shipment (because it's a war zone and who's going to check?) and the truck burned 240L getting to Korosten (at a Kamaz truck's roughly 4km/l), you only have 340 Liters to put in your tanks, when you were expecting 760L. Then multiply that by all the different kinds of things that need to be supplied to a front (from food to parts to even ammo)

Because if everything isn't going perfectly (like when you take command of a base that's missing 1/2-3/4 of what it's supposed to have) then you're in deep shit, *and* you can just tell the Boss that everything's going perfectly and he won't ever check because he'd have to leave his office and fly down, then you never tell the Boss what the real situation is. You also can't rectify the situation, because why would a fully supplied base order 50% more than it's supposed to already have on hand?

Because when your conscripts leave the military and go back to civilian life, if you leave them on the books, you can collect their paychecks and upkeep. Their posts won't get filled because they're still on the books. So your base is wildly understaffed from what it's supposed to be, but you can pocket the upkeep difference.

Because you have 20 ""full strength Battalion Combat Teams with veteran career soldiers"", you expect them to perform very well against the Eastern Bloc-level Ukrainian military and overrun the amateurs like the US overran the elite Iraqi Republican Guard units in 1991 in just 3 days, so why bother stockpiling 6 months of supplies when 1 month is already more than enough?",91d9839815a1b99c5cbf623c3e6a90db734e344d,True,False,,,,,0,1649068450,,0,{},i3c3vp0,False,t3_tvs8sc,False,True,t3_tvs8sc,/r/war/comments/tvs8sc/i_dont_understand_why_russian_supply_line_in/i3c3vp0/,1649068461,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649039650.0,

I will no longer go further into this. Everyone reading this know, that Serbs act the same way as Russians and do not for one second be surprised if Russians deny even this whole war happening, using the same vile tactics. Do not be surprised if Russians say that those poor women that were raped were prostitutes, that those people killed were payed actors or Ukranian army disguising themselves as civilians. Do not be surprised they hide their war criminals. And most of all, do not be surprised when they praise their war criminals for what they have done, with only one regret sent towards them: ""Why didn't you kill them all"".

Everyone else, do not listen to what this Serb is saying, for 30 years they are trying to deny [what they have done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Serbian_war_crimes_in_the_Bosnian_War). The same way Russians will try to deny what they have done in Ukraine. So many convicted Serb generals, commanders, leaders and soldiers are rotting in prison for this [genocide (and broadly, the ethnic cleansing of nonserb nationals in Eastern Bosnia and Northern Bosnia as well as Southeastern Herzegovina)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide).  

&amp;#x200B;

[Rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bosnian_War), stealing, murdering, [of wich their favourite was slitting the throat of people](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/karadzic-trial-witness-testifies-he-saw-bosnian-serbs-slit-prisoners-throats-1.651847), for which they practised on pigs prior to the acts on civilians, of course, was their way of waging war.   


[They besieged Sarajevo in the longest siege after WW2 yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo)   
The one and only time they tried taking Sarajevo[they got their shit pushed in so hard their burning bodies and tanks were on display for days, rotting before we arranged for them to take the bodies back](https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/may-2-marks-the-day-when-warajevo-was-defended-from-jna-attack/), that they resorted to the end of the war to ONLY shell civilian targets, causing multiple massacres in the city itself (of which the most infamous one was Markale massacre, [volume 1 and volume 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markale_massacres), a market in the center of Sarajevo where Sarajevans went to get their humanitarian aid and buy groceries, if there were any available), [constant sniper fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper_Alley), firing on civilians with anti-air heavy cannons, constant rape and terror on the only part of city they partially ocupied, called Grbavica, for which their [top dog was convicted of war crimes](https://balkaninsight.com/2013/04/01/the-bloody-career-of-bosnia-s-monster-of-grbavica/), and many more I do not have the courage to google now because this thing is really hard for me. I can't take seeing what the Russian dogs are doing in Ukraine and seeing the parallels what the Serbs did to my people. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And after all of this, all of this rape, pillage, throat-slitting, murder, terror, on top of which is genocide... 

They all deny this ever happening, the same way Russians are denying it ever happened, even though they know they did it. [It is in their ""patriotic songs""](https://youtu.be/6TwioIc6a_8). They take pride that their fathers are war criminals and mocking the international community for not being able to catch them all to take them to trial. This is a sick nation, very sick.

Between China and the United States some of the bloodiest battles of World war 2 were fought against Japan. Japan violated the Geneva convention through their mistreatment of POWs from the very start of the war with the Bataan Death March in which only around 54k of 70k POWs survived the 66 miles death March. Japanese soldiers would kill POWs who fell out from exhaustion or would drive up and down the line in jeeps randomly cutting POWs heads off. All the whole the POWs received no food or water in the blistering tropical heat. Many more allied POWs would die from starvation, illness from malnutrition, and the brutality of their guards. If your interested in the brutality of the Pacific there is lots of information on the battles of Okinawa, and Iwo Jima along with other brutal island hoping battles.  The US secretary of war estimated 1-4 million US/ allied casualties and more then likely the forced annialation of Japan would occur if the US invaded, so the choice to drop a bomb was made with the hopes the Emperor would surrender.

[],False,,Ddreigiau,,,[],,,,text,t2_3obyfea1,False,False,"Couple reasons:

First, and the most important from a standpoint of International Law (but not so much morally):

1. The atomic bombs dropped on Japan in **1945** \- and the entirety of WWII in general, honestly - occurred prior to the Geneva Convention of **1949**. There were ""Geneva Conventions"" prior, but they did not cover civilians, only sick and wounded soldiers. It was the GC of 1949 that covers most of what people associate with the ""Geneva Convention"", and Protocol I (adopted in 1977) that expanded the coverage of civilians in international conflicts.
2. Even if the GC of 1949 had occurred prior to 1945, Japan didn't sign it until 1953. The Geneva Convention only binds in conflicts between signatories.
3. That said, I believe that if the treaty had been in effect, yes it would violate the treaty, though I'd want to double check some specifics to be sure. The lack of any precision weapon technology and the presence of military targets might just barely justify it under the treaty's provisions.

Second, and more important from a moral standpoint (And I am not saying this makes it morally **okay**, only that this affects the moral evaluation):

1. War sucks. Especially wars in which precision munitions have not yet been invented, and as such, only something like 10% of bombs dropped are within 1km of their targets. **This in and of itself does not justify anything, but it does set the context of the atomic bombs.**
2. Both atomic bombings - while against targets within a city - were at least partially targeted at military-industrial ports. These new bombs were a major step up in scale from anything used prior, and policies in their use had not yet been updated to entirely account for just how much damage they caused. This was something known as **total war**, in which both sides are striking at *anything* that will harm their opponent's physical and political ability to wage war. Japan sent over 9,000 incendiary bomb-carrying balloons, with no target except ""somewhere in the Pacific NorthWest"" of the USA. I don't personally know of a more indiscriminate attack in WWII, though it was wildly ineffective.   
By contrast, the atomic bombings - while it was admittedly a very thin justification - did at least have that fig leaf of justification that there were major military targets in both cities. In Hiroshima's case, it was a Japanese Army Headquarters and military dock. In Nagasaki's case, it was a major military industrial center (and even then was actually a secondary target specifically due to the number of civilians present; Kokura was the primary target for that flight but weather necessitated the shift)
3. Estimates of the American casualty count of an American invasion of the Japanese main islands were in the 500k to 1million+ range. *Japanese* casualties, using prior island battles as a guide, were estimated at anywhere from 3x-10x the US casualty count. If I remember correctly, both A-bombs combined had a long term death toll of a little over 200k.  
Also, something that rarely gets brought up: Estimates of casualties from the time assumed a Japanese Army strength of **300k**, with no arming of civilians (unlike what was seen in the Battle of Berlin). Japan would certainly have armed civilians to fight - they were already using suicide soldiers - and, even worse for the casualties estimates, the Japanese Army actually had a strength of **900k** on their mainland at the end of the war, 3x what American planners had estimated.
4. Despite all this, I still think the two A-bomb drops were horrible. Many horrible things happen in war, and those *were* on the more-horrible side. With the benefit of hindsight, were there decisions that could have avoided it? Maybe. Hindsight always makes things look more clearcut than they were at the time, though.

Lastly, and more important in an argumentative standpoint:

* I've found that those actively trying to call the Atomic bombings of Japan aren't actually seeking a moral standpoint, they're usually just trying to find reasons to call the US bad. Were they bad? Yes. There were other, worse things the US did, though, that were *inarguably* worse, though, but they aren't brought up because the person arguing it is from a country that *also* did those things. They're choosing the Atomic bomb example not because it's bad - they're only choosing it because it's *unique to the US*. You want to discuss bad things the US did in WWII? Then why use Hiroshima as your example, and not the Tokyo firebombing, which had almost *double* the civilian casualties and no major military target to justify it, except that whatever nation the arguer is from has done the same?",8c2822148603dfd17a0b3e3c3faa8b9dd8370b65,True,False,,,,,0,1649034421,,0,{},i3amxkk,False,t3_tvl9ty,False,True,t3_tvl9ty,/r/war/comments/tvl9ty/japan/i3amxkk/,1649034435,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649005621.0,

I pretty much agree with this. The concept of Total War is key, where the resources of the entire nation was being marshalled into the war effort, including civilians.

To add some context, the US in their war against Japan were taking heavy losses in Okinawa at the time (and inflicting even worse). The prospect of invading mainland Japan with such fierce resistance must have been daunting, and the use of the nuclear bomb must have been attractive.

It is worth noting that the conventional firebombings of Tokyo earlier in the war killed more people than the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

War is won principally by eliminating the enemy’s will to resist. And the awesome power of the nuclear bomb would have demonstrated to Japan that they had no hope, and everything to lose. That was the point of dropping the bombs - Nagasaki was barely a strategic target.

Another point to note is that Japan didn’t exactly follow Geneva Conventions, so I believe in law the US didn’t have to apply it (this is debatable).",3099bb632502429892d60741d29bef7413446e82,True,False,,,,,0,1649032406,,0,{},i3aiizm,False,t3_tvl9ty,False,True,t1_i3a8hyx,/r/war/comments/tvl9ty/japan/i3aiizm/,1649032422,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649003606.0,

You gotta remember that WW2 was a whole different animal from any war before or since.  This was the first time we really saw the concept of Total War.  This is where every last bit of industry and citizen is bent towards the war effort.  Japan especially had moved its wartime industry into people's homes.  When the factories were leveled in late 44 they had people sew uniforms, cast bullets, even forge weapons at home. 

So, if these people are creating weapons to be used against you, and people from these homes are taking up those weapons to fight you, that makes them legitimate targets.

Huh? You're on a totally different soap box, mate.
I'm asking reddit, take note of that, which I use for my private use to censor gore, blood, death, nudity, cause I don't want every Joe blog who might happen to be next to me on the bus to see what's on my feed.

This is not the same as pretending horrible things are not happening. I don't use my private reddit subscriptions as an evangelical tool for the horrors of the world, nor do I think reddit is easily the best tool for it.

Not to say I don't get you, when I was in uni and younger I had the same drive of ""if everyone knew these awful things we'd surely do something about it!"". It doesn't work like that! I'm afraid, all you do by spamming awful things to people (including and especially children) is desensitisation and an emotional numbing. In other words you get the reverse of your goal, more people end up not caring because it is the new normal.

You call Putin, Putler, remember the og, with Hitler himself most Germans (heck, even Italians, Finns, Hungarians, Romanians, Croats, Spanish and even some Ukrainians) agreed and didn't condemned his actions, the result The Reich got ""nuked"", total distruction total annihilation, literally no two bricks were standing on each other, but the people got a second chance (not getting a second chance at the end of WWI, and trying to humiliate them, is the main reason Hitler existed), they got help in rebuilding, got help in their reintegration in the European family, and today they are not only a good neighbor, but also a justice champion, advocating for human rights etc, and they've becometh the pride of Europe, they are not only the backbone of the EU, they are the reason a United Europe exists...
My point is that Russians can have a similar path, and become a true European (values) champion, not today, maybe not even tomorrow, but is our duty to try and help and encourage their integration in Europe, because it works, lets do it this time even better, WITHOUT distroying a country and making millions suffer, eventually the war will end, somehow, eventually Putin will die as he is only human, this will not solve the problem, we owe it to ourselves to make sure another Putin doesn't get born..

I think that you are missing the point here. Putin is giving orders but at the line are just russians. If you during the war can kill kids, rape women, kill civilians etc  i have a bad information - you probably need some kind of help because this is not a ""normal thing during war"". Look at US, how many that kind of situations during wars they started have happened?.   
Russians are invaders here, they are not defending, they are the aggressors.  
for what we should forgive russians? 2008 Georgia? 2014 Chirmeria? 2022 whole ukraine?  
Even with china we can build strong relations (economic) but with russians and their approach?  


""pass out difference and forgive"" - Never. Whole russian population should pay for what putler did. In 2022 invade a democratic country for what?  
i just want to tell you what this war started month ago and they are killing civilians. Just image what will happen after 1-2 yrs.

You mean like Iraq?

The 1990s Gulf War was started when Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait without provocation, torturing and killing hundreds of its civilians - much like Putin is currently doing in Ukraine. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was widely condemned by the United Nations (including Russia, but now that it suits their narrative they love to pretend Iraq was a victim).

FYI, it wasn't just an 'American invasion' - it was a coalition of 35 nations including many middle eastern countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, and Qatar, just to name a few).

Saddam Hussein was a murderous dictator who was directly responsible for the death of over 1 million people. Long before his invasion of Kuwait he used chemical weapons against civilian populations during the Iran-Iraq war. Over 200 mass graves have been identified from the Saddam regimes 'purges', some containing as many as 15,000 bodies.

But yeah, poor Iraq. Just another 'victim' of evil western aggression, clearly. /s

Or maybe you're talking about Afghanistan? That would be quite Ironic, considering Soviet Russia invaded Afghanistan long before the US did (and got their asses handed to them, too). Besides, are you comparing a country that is recognized internationally as a state sponsor of terrorism to Ukraine? 

When extremists groups sponsored by the Ukrainian government hijack commercial airliners and fly them into buildings in Moscow - then you can talk. Until then, it's just another laughable false equivalency. 

Are you one of these people who blames the invasion of Ukraine on Russian civilians being killed in 'Donbass'. Funny how everyone i see making this claim can't seem to actually spell DONBAS. Makes me think you've probably never even been there. I have.

Or maybe you're talking about Nazi Germany during WW2? I think that one speaks for itself.
