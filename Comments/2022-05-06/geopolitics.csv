I'm all for promoting democracy but I don't think pushing states away is the answer, except in the most grevious cases of human rights abuse. We should remember that economic sanctions don't just affect the governments but have very real effects on the people who we claim to care about in these countries. Economic sanctions mean worse health and worse life expectancy. Democracies have very rarely ever been created by foreign pressure, the vast majority of democratic transitions have been due to domestic reasons. When we talk about isolating or containing countries we should ask what it will accomplish and what it will sacrifice. In general from what I've seen the answer is that they economically and politically align themselves with our rivals instead of us, while not actually democratizing. Personally I think we have more to gain by being friendly with countries we wish to change than hostile.

What's unique about the current moment in history is the US decided to set the rules in such a way that any nation can purchase raw materials on a global market and then manufacture those materials and sell those goods on a global market. At no other point in history has that been possible.

On top of that the US Navy secured safe and free trade on the every ocean, so that those goods can actually reach markets. 

All that meant that transportation costs were a fraction of what they were before (where shipping was always at the risk of piracy and privateering) and smaller nations (like Korea) can become wealthy and successful on a level that they would never have been possible before. 

In a multi-polar world where the US isn't setting the rules, will we have free trade? Will the oceans be as safe as they are now? Or at some point in the future will India be having an energy crisis and see the juicy super tankers sailing right by their shore on their way to east Asia and decide to grab a few. 

Right now it all works the way it does because the US is the only country with the naval power to set the rules for global trade. In a multi-polar world will the rules look the same?

Not only are there, as you point out, ethical issues with it, but you don't want to base a world order on something as transitory as one nation's preponderance of power. 

That said, we need nuance here. Just as the West cannot expect everyone to have (or even be able to have if they wanted to) governance configurations that perfectly match those of developed Western nations, we cannot also treat sovereignty as the ultimate global value. It will always be messier than that.

The truth is that we live in a smaller world thanks to technology. We cannot completely ignore what countries do within their own borders. Nor can we ignore the fact that authoritarianism and liberalism can never truly co-exist in a stable and peaceful equilibrium. The success of one system always erodes the legitimacy and norms of the other. World norms will tilt one way or another.

The liberal democracies will have to pull together to make sure that world norms tilt their way, irrespective of whether some nations seem to choose authoritarian governance as long term solutions. However, the 'free world' can pick and must pick its battles. It does not need to tilt things towards liberal values overly aggressively--it can show some patience with some authoritarian regimes. In particular, less powerful nations less likely to tilt world norms can be given more leeway. Also, nations at lower levels of development with 'transitional' authoritarian regimes due to a need for stability can be given appropriate time to evolve. 

Finally, the range of what is considered 'acceptable' in terms of liberal democracy has to be kept fairly wide. There has to be room for different cultures to choose their own balance between stability and order on the one hand, and individual freedom on the other. This is particularly true in the East where there is an inherent preference for greater order and disdain for some of the chaos and individual bad behavior they see tolerated in the West. 

Naturally, all of this works both ways: if sovereignty is not absolute for anyone, this includes Western nations. Criticizing what happens inside the borders of Western nations is also fair game. In time, a world order that may still be somewhat unipolar will have to transition to something more multipolar and based on international law and institutions. However, it is dangerous to rush the process or pretend we are further along that we are. We have a lot to figure out. For one, it is not clear that in a 'perfect world order' every nation should have equal say. At the same time, basing a nation's decision making weight on its population can create perverse incentives. But basing it on economic and/or military heft is also economically problematic.",af0300858dfd056b044ef3236bd240aa9f193c84,True,False,,,,,0,1651852291,,0,{},i7kgc7n,False,t3_ujol5z,False,True,t1_i7kd3bh,/r/geopolitics/comments/ujol5z/the_trouble_with_the_free_world_why_its_a_bad/i7kgc7n/,1651852303,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651823491.0,

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has revived the concept of “the free world.” On the day the attack began, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to “free world leaders” for support. In his State of the Union address on March 1, U.S. President Joe Biden emphasized “the resolve of the free world.” “The free world is united in its resolve,” echoed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson three days later.  


The return of the free world may have consequences that transcend the realm of rhetoric. From the late 1940s through the mid-1960s, the American commitment to free world leadership resulted in a series of unintended policymaking constraints.

&gt;There is no good or bad in international politics. I am advocating an alliance of mutual interest. China is not, will never, be friendly. Going all in on an with a alliance that isloates China will benefit us both militarily and economically. 

Well then why bring up the NAM countries not helping use then?Going against China will benefit us both militarily and economically?China is right next door to use and you're saying that allying with countries thousands of miles away who are obviously going to use us as fodder will benefit us?

&gt;Easy for you to say from a previleged position and not the millions of Indians that toil for everyday. Just because India inherited an ancient civilization doesn't mean it guarantees success. Look at Italy, Greece, the Levant, etc. 

Funny enough those millions of Indians tend to keep more pride in past than me. Once you talk about glory to Islam or Hinduism all of them will be willing to do anything. Quite funny you say that when those kind of religious and pride for the past is more common among the poor. Also which one of them are even close to comparable to India? Literally the only comparable country to India is China and vice versa. Instead of saying if China achieved it so could we you'd rather mention some random countries who weren't even the ancient 4 I was talking about and have neither the population, location or important landmass even comparable to either India or China 

&gt;You clearly have completely misinterpreted my comment, created a strawman and decided to reply to it. Also, have you bothered to read US's own assessment of world power? They fully acknowledge the multipolar world and are hedging with Europe and India for 2050 and beyond.

Oh isn't that rich coming from someone who's been projecting his own interpretation of my comments all this time?Yeah wow US acknowledged the world order and you'd know that because you're th chief of CIA?Funny enough you say the acknowledged the world order will be with Europe,USA and India huh?So apparently it's clearly not propoganda that they dismiss their biggest adversary I'd say in the current times,China who's probably the most likely to be in the world order first but mention India,a country with 6 times smaller economy and 5 times lower per capita income than China?

&gt;It quite clear you have read the headline and comments here but not actually bothered to read what the author stated was the Chinese framework for dealing with India. 

If I wanted to refer to the headline I would directly comment but I didn't because I meant to reply to your delusional comment? Mind-blowing isn't it?

&gt;Those border attacks are going to continue and if you haven't been paying attention we lost territory. It is time to counter back and seize territory on their end. What you are advocating is exactly what China wants.

As far as I remember,last time we lost territory was in 1962 war. It's pretty funny how delusional you are about things. Basically all your comments are based on assumption that the leaders in west have some 200 IQ and while they're planning all those important plans to counter China with countries like India,Japan etc China will just stay idle. Do you realise China has India surrounded? Pakistan,Nepal and Sri Lanka all in their palms,Maldives is having their India out campaign probably funded by China and Bangladesh sooner or later will be in the same spectrum with Myanmar already being close to it. If you love being a western fanboy then be it but maybe stop projecting your own ignorance as someone's own. You can go be a fodder for countries thousands of miles away but I doubt the people in the Indian government want to put 1.4 billion people in the same spot and that is why they're avoiding being directly against China unless it's necessary so and I'd rather have their advice than yours who think India is in any position to actually go head against China when even USA is losing in the trade war against them",29e0be14d99190417bbb9ca1cfb7413a03e43b2a,True,False,,,,,0,1651845036,,0,{},i7jyq88,False,t3_uipiu2,False,True,t1_i7jub5k,/r/geopolitics/comments/uipiu2/chinas_evolving_strategic_discourse_on_india/i7jyq88/,1651845049,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651816236.0,

Let's review some salient points:

1. Yanukovych wasn't a democrat.  He was a corrupt thug who was involved in stealing elections prior to 2010.  (See Orange Revolution.)  It's highly unlikely that there would be anything resembling free and fair elections in 2015.  He'd have arrested all his opponents.  So the only chance that Ukrainians had was kicking the dictator out with massive civil disobedience.
2. The Ukrainian military isn't capable of taking on the Russian military?  Well, the last two months have shown that this isn't the case.  In fact, Ukraine clearly has the more competent military of the two.  What Russia has is more men (a bigger country) and more military hardware.
3. Medvedchuk was working with Putin to foment a coup against the democratically elected government.  (Or more accurately he was pocketing the money from the FSB and sending back false reports to Moscow.)  Weird how the same people who whine about how Maidan was some American plot were okay with this.
4. Ukraine did end up coming up with an electoral compromise for its ethnic divisions.  It just did so in 2019, not 2015.  Zelensky won every region of the country.  He was a Russian-speaking candidate acceptable to Western Ukraine (outside Lviv) and a pro-European candidate acceptable to Eastern Ukraine.  It's just that analysts didn't pick up the significance of the changes in voting patterns because they were too busy being horrified over the flaky comedian winning.  I wonder now that Zelensky is being lauded rather than being dismissed they'll be some reexamination of the 2019 election.",3ae138490372b6f146f59a52d138f78c568ad88e,True,False,,,,,0,1651838280,,0,{},i7jl8m4,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i7jl8m4/,1651838294,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651809480.0,

&gt;Government sources said China proposed that Indian troops, who have been in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with Chinese troops at PP 15 for almost two years now, move back to the Karam Singh Post between PP 16 and PP 17. China said it would withdraw its troops just behind the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as claimed by India in that region.

&gt;Sources said this was unacceptable to India since the Chinese claim line and India’s understanding of the LAC almost intersect at PP 15. If India were to accept the proposal, it would mean that while Chinese troops would move back very little, Indian troops would have to withdraw several kilometres behind.

These are the kinds of proposals China usually offers India. Same as happened throughout the area. The buffer zones lie in claimed Indian perception areas, Depsang is already Chinas etc

There is nothing wrong or right with that. Every state works what it feels is within their own interests. China will offer what it feels is favourable to them. And India will only accept if it favourable to them",2a6f659a11c7562ed842cac30ba374ec28c4ee22,True,False,,,,,0,1651820054,,0,{},i7iyba8,False,t3_uipiu2,False,True,t1_i7iu4q7,/r/geopolitics/comments/uipiu2/chinas_evolving_strategic_discourse_on_india/i7iyba8/,1651820068,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651791254.0,

India's territory includes Aksai Chin, a part of Ladakh. That's how the borders were drawn by the British when they left India.

China follows the 1959 LAC agreement. India follows the 1993 LAC agreement.

North Korea is an early example because of its proximity to China, but we can expect similar destabilizing forces to arise (although perhaps less extreme) as China's reach expands and it purposefully supports powers that the West does not want to work with as a means to expand its own influence.

It does not seem to me that China has any intention of limiting itself in the future as the liberal powers have, hopefully liberal governments do not try to close the influence gap by dropping their standards and getting in bed with similarly destructive forces and tactics like they did  in the Cold War.
