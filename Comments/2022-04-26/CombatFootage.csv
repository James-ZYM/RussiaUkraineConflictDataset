But without that Russia can't grab the east and part of the south Ukraine and even if they can achieve a brief conquest they wouldn't have the numbers to hold it. So it really feels that something relevant must happen to end this.

I'm really skeptical about the scenario were Putin will use nukes, I really don't think we'll see any of that but Russia can't sustain this for too long. A mobilization will increase their power for a moment but will be also vastly expensive and a mess to orchestrate.

I don't see NATO making any relevant move that will decide this war so something must happen in Russia.

“There has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces,” said a former senior intelligence official familiar with the situation. The information includes commercial satellite images “but also a lot of other intelligence about, for example, where certain types of Russian units are active.”

Ukraine continues to move air defenses and aircraft nearly every day with the help of American intelligence, which is one reason Russia has not been able to establish air dominance. In some cases, Ukraine moved the targeted air defense systems or planes just in time, the officials said.

“The Russian military has literally been cratering empty fields where air defenses were once set up,” one U.S. official said. “It has had an enormous impact on the Russian military’s ability on the ground.”

In comparison, radar guided missiles like the AMRAAM or R77 fly almost twice as fast and can reach distances of over 50 miles, but cannot be carried by ground attack aircraft without a radar.

The meteor missile in your example is a radar guided missile, and the launch platform needs an internal radar to guide it to the target. The A-10 is like the Su-25 and has no radar, and thus cannot fire the meteor.

As you said, missile tech is the deciding factor in air-to-air engagements. However, we must also consider that certain airframes can support different weapons. Furthermore, a missile can only lock on to a target the radar can see, so aircraft with a more powerful radar and less cross-section will have a decisive range advantage even if the actual missile carried is the same.",0e079bb1cffbf48f6a4f81d52b1a5f4758e068b4,True,False,,,,,0,1651013839,,0,{},i6buqif,False,t3_ucda00,False,True,t1_i6b1dy3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ucda00/footage_claimed_to_show_a_russian_jet_shot_down/i6buqif/,1651013851,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650985039.0,

During the Sim if you get injured, what happens to you in our case was decided by the instructors. If they decided you're just lightly wounded, field medics would ""patch you up"" and you could go on. Everything heavier wounded or dead has to be transported like you would transport a real injured combatant. Operators declared injured are advised to not help during their rescue.

If you are out of it you go back to a rally point and wait for debriefing.

In debriefing you get to evaluate what went wrong and what was okay.

Has it an impact on the learning experience? Of course it does. The amount if times I ""got shot"" without even knowing opened my eyes to serious deficiencies e.g. in my situational awareness.

Through that I was able to focus my training on that because I was already a good shot hitting all my targets, that was just useless since I almost regularly died in scenarios.

These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wingtip to within 6 in (15 cm) of the lower surface of the V-1's wing. If properly executed, this manoeuvre would tip the V-1's wing up, over-riding the gyro and sending the V-1 into an out-of-control dive. At least sixteen V-1s were destroyed this way (the first by a P-51 piloted by Major R. E.

752,[],False,,obvom,,,[],,,,text,t2_7jo5w,False,False,"Hydrogen enters the lungs, enters the bloodstream, is pumped through blood vessels throughout the body, and diffuses through all tissues. Because it is the smallest molecule in the universe (literally) it can pass through every barrier in the body- blood brain, genitourinary, etc. etc. 

The gas is H2 and combines with the inflammatory compound called the Hydroxyl Radical or OH-. The H2 ""donates"" an H and turns OH- to H2O.

It does not seem to have an effect on blood volume, rather what reperfusion injuries do is generate a high amount of hydroxyl radicals due to the blood contacting surfaces outside of the blood vessels. Basically when, for example, you have a stroke, the blood vessel is blocked, then it bursts, and when it bursts you get a reperfusion injury which is where the vast majority of brain damage sets in. 

&gt;Reperfusion injury, sometimes called ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) or reoxygenation injury, is the tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to tissue (re- + perfusion) after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen (anoxia or hypoxia). The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than (or along with) restoration of normal function.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reperfusion_injury#:~:text=Reperfusion%20injury%2C%20sometimes%20called%20ischemia,oxygen%20(anoxia%20or%20hypoxia).

Notice the presence of ""oxidative stress."" This is what inflammation is. Antioxidants=anti-inflammatories. What is unique about hydrogen in particular is that it does not seem to act on any particular pathway, it only interacts with the hydroxyl radical (and also the peroxynitrite radical which is also nasty but for the sake of simplicity we are focusing on OH-). Thus, the normal side effects that accompany anti-inflammatory supplements and drugs at high dosages over prolonged periods of time, which are due to the drugs inhibiting both the ""toxic"" free radical/oxidate compounds AND the ""reactive oxygen species,"" or ROS which cells use to literally breathe, are not present. There are no ""clinically significant side effects"" from prolonged H2 therapy. 

We are so used to oxygen being a sort of medical miracle gas. Think of all the people that would have died without oxygen therapy. We take it for granted. I firmly believe hydrogen is going to take its place alongside oxygen as one of the greatest achievements in medicine in the history of humanity.

In the first couple of minutes of extreme stress, adrenaline hasn't had the chance to significantly alter the picture on the ground in your body, but the classic line is that there are ""three components"" to any event response: an autonomic response (heart rate up, BP up, pupils contract, time 'slows down'), a behavioral response (duck, run!) and a hormonal response (cortisol, adrenaline). All three play a role; adrenaline is a relatively small part of the picture that gets a lot of play.

I can.

First plane is a SU-25, second plane is a SU-25. At the very beginning its pretty clear that the first plane isn't Mig-29 or any of the later SU family planes.

All of those planes got twin vertical fins and two visibly distinct booms, the first plane clearly lacks all of that. The only logical and possible answer is a SU-25! 

&gt; The description of the vid cast doubt on that claim although I wouldn’t take it with any degree of confidence.

And i agree with you, a reasonable stance.

However i will repeat, there is no afterburner involved anywhere in the clip, chiefly due to the fact that neither of those planes got an afterburner.

Not exactly. When determining the power to create a shoving force or create an impulse, kinetic energy isn't what you'd look at.

When it comes to creating an impulse and transferring physical motion into a target in a collision, momentum determines this impulse far more accurately than energy. Energy more so determines how much damage will be done to the plate and, depending on deformation of the plate, how much damage the wearer will receive. But, for shoving someone forward, momentum matters. You cannot create an impulse greater than the combined momentum of both objects in a collision or else you would violate conservation of momentum.

7.62x54R 7N1, a sniper loading, will have slightly more than 8kg\*m/s of momentum to transfer into the target. Given the round striking the plate is a nearly totally inelastic collision, almost all of that momentum will be imparted into the target. While it does have over 3,300 joules of energy, that's not what determines the impulse from being hit by a projectile; that is the plate and his back muscle's worry.

Your 223 m/s fastball, while having comparable kinetic energy of 3,531, is packing a nice 32kg\*m/s of momentum. Assuming the ball completely imbeds itself into his plate to make the collision inelastic, that is 4x the momentum imparted on the person and will fell like a shove 4x stronger.",4254bd7b4c2d050cfcc7b3143817bc5c40b2908f,True,False,,,,,0,1651003940,,0,{},i6b7m9q,False,t3_uc7you,False,True,t1_i68vv1o,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uc7you/armour_plate_saves_a_us_soldier_after_getting_hit/i6b7m9q/,1651003952,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650975140.0,

1426,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"For me, ongoing sanctions (and the ability to supply and produce the arms they're contracted for) are likely a bigger challenges to Russia's military industrial complex than simply poorer than expected performance.  One of the reasons Russia has long been able to sell arms to places like China, India, Vietnam, Syria, Venezuela is because those countries either lack the ability to purchase western arms due to ideological opposition, or because they fear being cut off in the event of a war. They aren't buying Russian stuff because they're good, but because of political reasons. 

It will be interesting to see how their import substitution on key components for some of their systems works. We have already seen cancelled orders because Russia couldn't fulfill them in a timely manner.  You did hit on a significant point with your comment about the Su34. Something like 40% of their exports are planes and Russian planes haven't covered themselves in glory. India has already cancelled one contract.  Same goes for Missiles.  Russia is apparently stalled on some types of missile production due to sanctions.  That's another 15% or so. 

The war has brought up other considerations though.  It is readily apparent that they may not be able to rely upon Russia in the event of a war, either  because Russia is going to have a huge backlog of equipment they need to produce to refill their own army. Win or lose. Equally, they might be under a sanctions regime that makes it hard to ensure a steady supply of arms in the event of a war. Theoretically, 25% of their entire exports is just planes and missiles to India and India has to be looking at them cross-eyed at this point because it is leaving them unable to be able to buy planes at a period of tension with China. According to one article I read, French fighters, Israeli drones/missiles, and American helicopters are all making inroads due to Russian problems. India was also looking for technology transfers when they buy fighters these days too, and Russia seems unwilling to allow that, making it unlikely they'll be able continue going forward. This is a problem for Russia because the Russian government caps the money tehy can earn on domestic sales.  The way they can try and fund new models is by exporting.  Without exports, the companies will, inevitably die off. 

Air defense is another big seller. From what I've seen, the AA has mostly been ""as advertised"". Their older Anti-Air systems have been used by Ukraine to good effect against the Russian air force so the newest models will likely continue to sell well. 

The tanks are fighting like dogshit, but Russia has mostly moved on from selling old T-72s anyway.  Their newest models of tanks/IFV (T-14 and T-15) haven't been used in the war so I don't see how anyone would judge their performance. That said, India operates a lot of T-90's and since it is so close to the T-72 in design, I can't imagine they're happy watching T-72 turn into lollipops around the battlefield. 

The AK-12 was never going to sell well, IMO. The Typhoon seems to have done well in the conflict so that will likely continue. Same goes for the TIGR.  I haven't seen anything to suggest there are problems and they seem to have a market for them internationally. 

I don't know much about the Tornado and SMERCH rocket artillery performance thus far. Maybe someone else can chime in.

This is a video showing something happing at low level. Unless in a panic, fighter jets won't go over Mach 1 at low level, specially the fighters involved in this conflict, 4th gen Soviet era.   


Mach numbers depend on altitude, mostly because of the density of the air. To achieve Mach 1 at low flying levels you need to burn a lot of fuel, full afterburner, which makes it even easier to lock on to with heat-seeking MANPADS like the Stinger, which have a top speed of about Mach 2.5 and a range of about 4km. So it doesn't really help, it's better to flare and maneuver.

For some systems that require a ton of extra training in might be months but a lot of things like ammunition, assaults rifles, body armor, scopes, night vision equipment and so are arriving a hell of a lot faster than months, we're talking weeks or even days in some cases. The US and NATO countries have been supplying Ukraine with a massive amount of material for almost 2 months now, the system is probably a well oiled machine by now.",5ab6819a7c78e70032b66d3de7689bce1c08dcde,True,False,,,,,0,1650995262,,0,{},i6al4h7,False,t3_uch35p,False,True,t1_i6ak687,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uch35p/kalibr_missile_strike_on_ua_munitions_warehouse/i6al4h7/,1650995274,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650966462.0,

Ukraine accepted the deal when they were weak, delayed implementing it to bide time while they built up forces. Zelensky won saying he would go against the Minsk agreement. 

The solution here is simple. 
1. Either take back Donbass into Ukraine with more autonomy on their regional decisions and make sure they are well represented.
2. Let Donbass be independent
3.

As a thought experiment, imagine you came into work tomorrow and everyone was handed a gun and told to go attack somewhere 10 miles away. What sort of issues would you run into immediately? You might quickly work out some sort of organization with ad hoc leadership etc., but then you are taking this brainstormed organization and adding explosions and bullets into the mix, random people dying gruesomely. You don't have the ammo for long fighting, what you do have you will quickly run through, and you probably face armor you have no ability to destroy. Quickly it will fall apart, or be next to useless.  The best case scenario for hastily made militias is just holding the ground they live on defensively, and they will still suffer severely in this vs trained troops.

Supposing they could arm another 200,000 people right away with rifles, simply knowing how to shoot a rifle will not make you effective on a modern battlefield. They need to be trained how to assault, hold positions, dig trenches, and operate as teams. There isn't much value in having a mob of people in trenches with guns, you need cohesion and drilling to be at all usable outside of static positions in cities maybe.

The other thing is that ad hoc formations also need just as much supply as normal ones. Untrained soldiers eat food just as much as trained ones, and probably use up more ammo. They can't be directed to attack targets easily because they aren't as well integrated into the military hierarchy, and so even if commanders can control them they will be reluctant to use them because they can't trust they will accomplish objectives. If you are launching an attack, you want the supporting troops to arrive on time and not create almost a hostage situation if they get overrun.

So they are probably arming and training people as fast as they can, but they are going to prioritize simply getting adequate supplies to what fully trained troops there are. Even in a drastically accelerated training program, a few months can make a world of a difference.",79461d13659f1b3b79b95d4a4459abee52b4ef23,True,True,,,,,0,1650988265,,0,{},i6a2y6a,False,t3_ub5nez,False,True,t1_i68lhrc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ub5nez/ukraine_war_discussionquestion_thread_42522/i6a2y6a/,1650988284,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650959465.0,

We didn’t just conduct a large scale invasion of Vietnam in a day. We started off with advisor teams for the South Vietnamese military, slowly the troop buildup started happening when we began to support the South Vietnamese with air support. 

With that comes mechanics, logistical support guys to fuel, feed and supply Air wing personnel, with that comes that is infantry units to protect these guys. 

It just continued to build and build and build. Before anyone really paid attention to the war in the States in 64-66 we were already in over our heads in the war leading the main effort for the South Vietnamese. 

You could make a comparison to the Russians to US Soldiers in Vietnam but I don’t think that is a fair comparison either. Both sides in that war conducted horrible acts not just to each other but to the population as well.

Hydrogen acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and prevents ""reperfusion injuries"" aka the injury that results after initial injury, when blood rushes out of injured blood vessels and floods the space around them in the brain, causing a massive inflammatory attack which results in brain damage. The research is clear in animal models, that brain trauma can be averted when hydrogen is applied. The research has extended to human clinical trials in Japan and other countries, showing increased recovery post stroke (citations below).

An electrolysis machine that can mix ambient air with pure hydrogen (to prevent explosive potential) only requires distilled water, electricity, and a disposable nasal cannula to administer hydrogen in a hospital or other setting. These devices already exist (I own a few already) and they work very well.

There's multiple stories of very similar behavior among dogs going back 70 years.  

Gunner was a stray border collie in Darwin Australia that was adopted by aussie air force members.   Gunner could give them 15 minutes notice of an incoming air raid, becoming agitated and barking at the soldiers and eventually heading into the bunker with the soldiers.  The post commander even eventually was convinced enough that he gave approval for the air raid sirens to sound when Gunner started trying to get soldiers to go into bunkers.

I think you have it wrong that the Dems were just able to xfer the hatred of Trump to Putin.   There is a bigger picture.  It's really a reaction to increased fascism in the US and seeing Russia as behind it.

Trump brought about an increased support for a more authoritarian system in the US.  The Jan 6th Insurrection is an example of that, but it didn't stop there and it didn't stop with Trump.  Fox News and other media groups have been pushing for a more fascist America.  Tucker Carlson, in particular, is the worst.  He's been promoting Putin and Orban in Hungary on a regular basis.  Even white supremacists feel that Carlson is promoting their arguments better than they are.  There has been a rise in authoritarian and fascist believes in the US on the right.  Putin and Orban have been held up as ideal leaders that we should have in the US. 

There has been open speculation about Tucker Carlson (and others of his ilk) being on the payroll of Russia.  It's possible that he's just a fascist that wants to promote his viewpoint and he's fond of Putin, but it's also possible that he is being paid by Putin (or both, really).  Overall, though, there has been concern in the US about this rise.  I believe the harsh reaction against the invasion in Ukraine is a step by those on the Left and Moderates to push back against an authoritarian government and what that means.  It's not so much a transfer of hatred of Trump to Putin, as you describe, but a fear of fascism in the world and a chance to stop it.

There has been a shift in opinion for many Republican voters on Putin since the invasion of Ukraine.  It is a harsh example of the outcome of fascism and authoritarianism.  I hate to say it, but seeing white people in Europe with roughly the same living standards getting shelled is repulsive to them (what I mean is it's good they are repulsed, but believe it has to be white people that look like them that draws the reaction).  The unabashed aggression of invading a smaller country and killing it's civilians has turned many people off the authoritarian leaders that many on the right have been holding up as shining examples of what to look for in a leader.   

In short, I think it's the anti-authoritarian forces in the US that are wanting to push back against the rising forces of fascism they see in their own country.  Helping Ukraine is the most available option for them right now to support.  It's also become bi-partisan due to the cruelty done to the Ukrainian people.",ce9ecc8c49b1b7300f6ddafd1415c065c8a8c4ef,True,False,,,,,0,1650980645,,0,{},i69jrq2,False,t3_ub5nez,False,True,t1_i65vez5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ub5nez/ukraine_war_discussionquestion_thread_42522/i69jrq2/,1650980662,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650951845.0,

That's not a bad thing.  People making comments citing facts should link their sources to begin with.  That way everyone can see and evaluate them themselves should they want to.

1) increases the odds of not finding the original source

2) places the burden on the reader, not the one making claims.  The onus is correctly on the person making the claim, not the tens, hundreds, thousands reading it.

I believe this to be not particularly relevant. Assad's regime never branded themselves as a Shia (they're actually Alawites which is a split of sect of shiasm) but as a government for all Arabs/Syrians. In Assads propaganda Syrian unitiy is often preached, particularly between Islamic sects and between Christians and Muslims*. Also Assad's army compromises mostly of non-alawites, this makes sense as according to Wikipedia only 13% of Syria's population is Shia (Not all of them Alawites). So Assad's government has always tried to be more or less secular. Opponents of Assad claim however that his government has favored Alawite communities over certian Suni communities, I can't judge wether this is true or what the reasons for this will be (I would assume power politics over an actual religous conviction).

Agreed it's economic warfare, it's not just present on country level, it's present on corporation level (big corporations buying smaller ones or just killing them with competition). But Russia made the worst move possible with the war.

All the points you mentioned, it makes even less sense why Russia invaded (unless we believe that it could have overthrown the government in a few days). It's hurting its economy in a large way, the west is being pushed into implementing measures to reduce their dependency on Russia in the future (whether they implement it or not is to be seen, but it's still a push).

Italy attacked for similar reasons and hugely underestimated the Greek defenders. The country was a nightmare to move through and that meant strong resistance. The Greeks were also strong of the British support both in equipment and manpower. The attacking troops had very low morale as they didn't have the means to perform and saw the conflict as a fratricidal war. Winning ultimately meant re-routing many men and supplies from North Africa and German aid.

Destabilizing their neighbours in south America to use drugs to fund proxy war efforts. Fighting proxy wars all across the world and arming rebel and terrorist groups in both Asia and pacific. All of this is an imposition on others that democracy and western ideals are the only true way and everyone else is wrong. Through Art, Media, Economy and finally war.

I personally am very pro freedom of choice and independence. People should be allowed more autonomy over their own regions instead of a top down approach. I fully support the separation of LPR/DPR if they weren't getting what they wanted from their country. Same applies for Chechnya, if they want freedom they should have got it. Doesn't matter who is funding it for what reason. Diplomacy over war.

Syria has a long tradition but together with the Captagon production fuelled by the Syrian civil war it turned Syria into a narco state:

* Syria is a narco-state with two primary drugs of concern: hashish and the amphetamine-type stimulant Captagon. Syria is the global epicentre of Captagon production, which is now more industrialised, adaptive, and technically sophisticated than ever.
* In 2020, Captagon exports from Syria reached a market value of at least 3.46 billion USD. Though conjectural, a market ceiling significantly higher than this is distinctly possible.
* Although Captagon trafficking was once among the funding streams utilised by anti-state armed groups, consolidation of territorial control has enabled the Assad regime and its key regional allies to cement their role as the prime beneficiaries of the Syrian narcotics trade.
* The drug trade will perpetuate conflict in Syria, erode the rule of law, and impede the restoration of holistic economic functionality.
* In addition to social costs borne by Syrians themselves, the Syrian drug trade will also have a destabilising impact on neighbouring and regional states, which will be forced to bear additional societal and law enforcement burdens as a result.

You can learn to use an AK or vz58 in an afternoon and in the evening you can learn how to maintain it and troubleshoot it. With AR15 platform you just have to wake up a bit earlier that morning. Guns are the easiest part of the military. But I was never trained how to act under fire - I had like 2 weeks shooting dummy rounds and then couple months learning how to drive bunch of stuff. I learned how to drive a forklift in military. I never learned how to act in firefight. I think these fellas were probably in the same.

They didn’t wait for the smoke round that one of them called for either, and they didn’t wait to be vectored into attack by the forward air controller - who’s job partially exists for the reason of making sure aircraft hit what they’re meant to hit. They knew they didn’t know exactly and POPOV36 attacks anyway. 

Given the way they did things and the number of things they didn’t do, I’m not sure “hey, we’re killing those guys today” isn’t exactly what they were thinking. I wouldn’t really call it a tragic accident where all parties are deserving of pity. I’d call it as veteran, professional pilots with plenty of time both military and commercial, you should know better.",cef1fd77aa52ded77e6983a7d388233ce48cda07,True,False,,,,,0,1650964932,,0,{},i68tj07,False,t3_ubliyh,False,True,t1_i67ywts,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ubliyh/accidental_friendly_fire_incident_between/i68tj07/,1650964944,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650936132.0,

Have you considered that he doesn't want to talk about war with YOU personally or just feels depressed?

&gt;Ukraine using civilians as meat shields? You think Ukrainians are raping and killing civilians? 

There are multiple stories from the people of Mariupol about their treatment from the ukrainian army and azov. There is evidence they've started destroying houses with tanks prior to russian and dpr's army entering the city. I know that there's at least one cased opened by prosecutors about ukrainian soldier raping a woman in Mariupol and killing her husband. 

&gt;Not destroyed by Ukraine mind you, but we must take revenge!!

It wasn't destroyed by the ukraine. It was hit by them and sunk a day and a half after during the ship towing. 

&gt;You think Putin and his bunch of cunts don't have yachts and private jets and palaces?

I think that government officials shouldn't be able to buy a yacht and build a palace while businessmen can spend their legally made money as they see fit. 

&gt; find the video about Putin's palace by Navalny.

You think Putin and his bunch of cunts don't have yachts and private jets and palaces? If you still have access to Google and YouTube and aren't scared, find the video about Putin's palace by Navalny.

If ukrainian military would just sit out in the open the war would be very one sided. Ukraine is using its land and its infrastructre to defend against the invading force. They use every advantage they have because they need it. If you complain about civilian lives and so forth, shit out of luck because russia started this invasion. This right here is the very reason why so many people are against russia and against every war ever. Some maniac decides that his politcal ambitions are more important and forces another country to defend itself.   


Yes, Ukrainian army uses civilian infrastructre alot of it. And local residents sometimes ask them to go somewhere else. Of course this is not an option and its very bitter sweet and sad. But those soldiers also didn't vote to go to war against russia, russia decided. its on them.   


On the otherhand people in other subreddits are sometimes a bit tad delusional in the other direction and refuse to believe that the ukrainian army actually does that, especially schools are used all the time, they do that, its not a secret and its not their fault and nobody goes to school. 

This war is shit, the worst thing for any ukrainian, people need to stop cheering this war on from anyside. Civilians suffer the most, especially those in affected oblasts.

Why do they torture prisoners of war, fuck with corpses and place their troops inside schools? Why zelensky won't let male population to leave the country?

Ukraine declared already general mobilization and even there a lot of people dodge the service especially in cities. A lot of the wealthy people left, in spite of legally not being allowed. 

Everybody who wants to join the fight can do so and a lot of people also did, not directly in the army but in the defense of their local region.

Why do you want people in your army who do not want to fight, have no expierence? I do not know what the suppy status is but it probably also would be hard to equip so many. Ukraine has already suffered a lot from corruption in the army the last years and has not much money. But also a lot of draft dodgers.

I don't see why you'd even deny this.

No, you're thinking in terms of modern expensive tanks.

A modern T-72 costs no more than a million - and less if these were old T-72s not in the best of conditions. 

The American Abrams was so dominating precisely because it was *that much more expensive* than other modern tanks at the time. An Abrams was costing more than 5 times the cost of a Soviet T-72. It was a crushing tank with a crushing cost.

When people see 100 Abrams pwning 100 Iraqi tanks they think ""equal fight won by Americans decisively"" instead of ""totally unequal fight where one side's equipment cost 10 times more resources than the other side""

Many times, when Russia and other countries don't field the theoretically best tech, it's not necessarily because they can't make such tech, but because the price tag makes no sense for them.

&gt;The ANZAC Strike Wing attacks

&gt;Bristol Beaufighters Mk X's from No 455 RAAF Squadron and No 489 RNZAF Squadron (together these two Squadrons formed the ANZAC Strike wing) attack German ships with a mix of RP-3 Rockets, 20mm cannons and 303. machine gun fire.
Off Heligoland, Germany. 12/08/1944

&gt;13 aircraft can be seen in the photo, but more would've been present.

&gt;A rocket salvo combined with a strafing run from an off-screen Beaufighter to the left just misses its target, while to the top right a Beaufighter dives in for its attack run while trailing smoke, either from damage or from firing its weapons.

&gt;The ship under attack is trailing a Barrage balloon.

&gt;The ship on the left appears to have already been badly damaged, billowing smoke and on fire.

&gt;The ANZAC Strike wing also flew air-sea rescue missions, escorted convoys and anti-submarine work.

&gt;Photo taken by the turret gunner from a Beaufighter that just completed an attack run.

&gt;The ANZAC Strike Wing attacks

&gt;Bristol Beaufighters Mk X's from No 455 RAAF Squadron and No 489 RNZAF Squadron (together these two Squadrons formed the ANZAC Strike wing) attack German ships with a mix of RP-3 Rockets, 20mm cannons and 303. machine gun fire.
Off Heligoland, Germany. 12/08/1944

&gt;13 aircraft can be seen in the photo, but more would've been present.

&gt;A rocket salvo combined with a strafing run from an off-screen Beaufighter to the left just misses its target, while to the top right a Beaufighter dives in for its attack run while trailing smoke, either from damage or from firing its weapons.

&gt;The ship under attack is trailing a Barrage balloon.

&gt;The ship on the left appears to have already been badly damaged, billowing smoke and on fire.

&gt;The ANZAC Strike wing also flew air-sea rescue missions, escorted convoys and anti-submarine work.

&gt;Photo taken by the turret gunner from a Beaufighter that just completed an attack run.

Fun Fact: The RPO Rys is essentially a spitball launcher.

It contains a crushable plastic canister filled with the russian equivalent of Napalm mated to a rocket engine that burns out while still in the tube. The acceleration during launch raptures the plastic canister, and upon contact with air, the contents of the now raptured canister ignite.

In practice, it looks like a roughly football sized ball of burning slime speeding through the air.

As expected, the accuracy, range, and overall effectiveness is a little lacking.

It was developed to replace flamethrowers, which had an even more limited range, and in this role, it performed well enough.

It is a really old system, so malfunctions happen pretty often. Modern equivalents replaced the ""burning spitball"" projectile with impact fuzed projectiles containing both russian napalm and small subprojectiles to spread the fire more effectively.",0750d884cacb75e989e645c7d23bba2fd27bf0a8,True,False,,,,,0,1650953608,,0,{},i68g3qk,False,t3_uc0hul,False,True,t3_uc0hul,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uc0hul/a_russian_special_forces_soldier_firing_an_rpo/i68g3qk/,1650953624,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650924808.0,

1. Russia has superiority but not supremacy.  Ukraine can still make their life difficult, even if Ukraine can't assert their own superiority. 

2. Ukraine is mostly hitting helicopters but they're also catching a few dedicated ground support jets and fighter jets. The planes are expensive and teh weapons that kill them are cheap. 

3. Russia's army doesn't have a lot of ground support aircraft that look like jets. They apparently rely on artillery, missiles, and ground support helicopters

4. The Russian air force doesn't have a lot of multi-role jets like the west. F-16, F15, F35, F18, etc.. who can both bomb people and attack other fighters with missiles. They can't use their fighter jets to supplement their lack of dedicated ground support jets. They each have their role and they apparently don't cross over. 

5. Russia's helicopters and even their ground support jets are highly vulnerable to all the MANPADS/anti-air systems the west has been sending. 


Because of the forgoing, Russia's air superiority is apparently kind of...meaningless?  They can use their fighters to keep Ukraine from having air superiority, but the lack of bombers and vulnerability of their helicopters makes it difficult to reap a lot of benefit from it.

You completly missed my point, did not engange in anything I said, rather you linked to a comment of mine (out of context) from so long ago, Kherson wasn't even captured by the russians yet.   


Litteraly making a ""one off"" post trying to roast me. I stand by my comment and especially the parent comment even if not all turned out to be true, a lotdid. It was an opinion on how I thought the russian would operate, not on whats going to happen. You would understand this if you actually made more effort than link my comment off context and looked what I actually replied too.

I didn't roast anyone and especially not from so long ago, how did you you even find that comment. I simply answered to the people form yesterday discussion thread because that one gut cut and a new one was opened (this one). If you actually check that thread, a lot of people are under the impression that ukraine was already in progress of liberating kherson, and asked what happened. Other people argued a new offensive in that region will let the russian forces be cut off. 

Thats what I replied to, not to one person in specifc rather to the growing misintrepation whats happening the oblast since the pentagon claimed, not only kherson oblast but kherson city is contested. If anything the only ""person"" I called out is the us pentagon who  do not give a fuck about what I do or say.

The entire Georgia's population combined with all the former Baltic Republics of the USSR amounts to a city. That's irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and the region of Ossetia has historically been made up of various migrant groups .

Just like Georgia, Ukraine, Russia or any other state on this planet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is a considerable difference between the two.

Not really. Following your logic Ukraine is a Russian territory.

&gt;The region of South Ossetia was also part of Georgia up until the early 1800s when it was ~~stolen~~ annexed by the Russian empire.

What are you on about? In the early 1800's the entire Georgia decided to join the Russian Empire.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Just because you are unaware, doesn't mean it didn't happen

So - when and where this ""shelling"" took place?

&gt;and you greatly simplify the run up to the conflict in 2008.

Do I?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There was much tit for tat between Georgia and South Ossetia before the war

*""Firefights involving small arms and incursions been happening all the time since the dissolution of USSR.""*  


&gt;Georgia's large scale advance was poor decision on their part, but this fight was yet another conflict designed by Russia.

So in response to incursions and provocations committed by Ossetians (in response to Georgian incursions and provocations) Georgia started the war but the blame is on Russia? Is that right?  


&gt;No, I mean cease-fire. The Sochi Agreement wasn't a peace treaty.

So neither a cease-fire or a treaty - an agreement. My point - ""cease fire"" periods been happening there after each escalation.

I don't know if you remember this time but most people were under the impression they would completely bomb kiev and that everywhere there will be insurgencies. 

Yes he was incorrect in that Kharkov was to fall and rusisia only laid partial siege to kiev. But that comment was a lot more restrained than the hive mind who thought Ukraine can only win by partisans. 

In fact, he correctly predicted that in the occupied regions there will not really be a lot of push back instead Peaceful protest.

I think if dug deeper eventually there will be something found under god how many comment's that turned out to be true, but at least he's not copying his opinion from everyone else and twitter experts, he uses his own opinion from what he observed.

And I think you are being ingenious saying he still believes that when his other comment in this thread is saying Ukraine won the war unless Russia uses magic.

and the other comment of his in the thread you linked actually was a comment chain, where his original take was he thinks kiev his a way to hard city to capture, and someone replied: russia just will bomb it to shit, and he providee the comment you linked to answering they will not do that, at most some military government building.

These reserve units are going to be the primary units being prioritized to be brought into service (this is the current stage Ukraine is at, activating reserves). these take 1-2 months. 

3. Only after reserve divisions are equipped, trained, and brought to the front would they take on trained conscripts and give them a refresher training. they will likely assign them   as replacements for KIA/WIA just like they've been doing with the foreign volunteers. 

4. I know of zero defections among Ukrainian soldiers and very few surrenders. Mostly it has been captures. 

5. Ukrainian morale is high. I don't expect conscripts and reserves to show any less fighting spirit than regulars. Especially because of Russian war crimes and execution of prisoners. 

6. I don't expect the quality of Ukrainian units to significantly dip as they they integrate replacements. That said, there might be a dip a bit if a particular unit has large scale losses to replace.

7. Completely new units will likely be less equipped and less trained, they will likely be called upon as guards and relief for more well-trained soldiers.",2aa633911a03b7d0e5eb504b1d08feacc6def157,True,False,,,,,0,1650943175,,0,{},i67yuhh,False,t3_ub5nez,False,True,t1_i67upa0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ub5nez/ukraine_war_discussionquestion_thread_42522/i67yuhh/,1650943191,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650914375.0,

Hardly. South Ossetia's population barely amounts to a small city, let alone a nation and the region of Ossetia has historically been made up of various groups of migrants. Georgia, on the otherhand, is a distinct ethnic group with a history as a nation dating back to at least the 11th century, if not further. There is a considerable difference between the two. The region of South Ossetia was also part of Georgia up until the early 1800s when it was ~~stolen~~  annexed by the Russian empire.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm unaware about any shelling. Firefights involving small arms and incursions been happening all the time since the dissolution of USSR.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand - Georgia amassed troops and invaded Ossetian territory effectively starting a full scale war in the region.

Just because you are unaware, doesn't mean it didn't happen and you greatly simplify the run up to the conflict in 2008. There was much tit for tat between Georgia and South Ossetia before the war and Georgia's large scale advance was poor decision on their part, but this fight was yet another conflict designed by Russia.

I’ve made no comments on why any government does anything.

But I’ve explained very clearly why this is a propaganda picture. How about you provide me with a reason why a photographer that’s accompanied by two fighters that feel it’s necessary to low crawl through muck for safety, decides it’s safe enough to sit up, or kneel, to take a picture?

2. With Russia we can see the number of officers killed, OSINT data on vehicles destroyed, released intercepted communications and open source leaks, intel assessment of various unit strengths from analysts, capture rates, Russian admissions, Ukrainian claims, Pentagon assessments, British MOD assessments, alleged leaks, OSINT assessments of soldier funeral #'s, etc.. which all paint a mostly consistent picture.

3. Ukrainian losses are much harder to calculate.  They either have better OPSEC (or Russia isn't releasing as much verifiable data).  Russia's claims have been proven to be completely unreliable, Ukrainian admissions of their own losses would be suspect, and while capture rates are helpful they are only a single data point and prone to misinformation due to Russia's continued arrest of non-combatants. Also, Pentagon and UK MOD assessments either have ridiculous ranges or are suspect the same way Ukraine's would be.

Without that kind of data, it is pretty impossible to know.  That said, we probably can say the following:

1.  Ukraine's losses are likely 1/2 to 1/5th Russia's due to the nature of the warfare/operations and the various assessments out there. 

2. Ukraine has been bringing up reserves at a much faster rate while Russia has been able to reinforce with trained units from around Russia. 

3. Ukraine has been mobilizing Territorial Units and volunteers on a larger scale than Russia given what is available from open sources. 

4. Russia has already committed additional forces and seems unwilling to use conscripts in the near future.

5. The overall size of the Russian and Ukrainian forces that are in Ukraine is near parity or going towards Ukraine's favour. The remaining Russian forces are (according to experts) necessary for other Russian operations or unable to be used in Ukraine.",fee1df4bd893598249e0994ebc34c2409e273532,True,False,,,,,0,1650937759,,0,{},i67muar,False,t3_ub5nez,False,True,t1_i67hecn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ub5nez/ukraine_war_discussionquestion_thread_42522/i67muar/,1650937772,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650908959.0,

The threat environments that rescue assets operate within can be adjusted by the use of supporting aircraft. Supporting aircraft providing air-to-air, air-to-ground, and Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) coverage can degrade the threat, either temporarily or permanently, permitting rescue assets to enter the area and execute the recovery. Rescue forces may be augmented by these supporting systems depending on the threat environment, distance to the survivor, and availability of assets.

The US Air Force currently maintains two operational systems, the HC-130N/P and the HH-60G. The HC-130 provides long-range search capability in a no-to-low threat environment, day or night. The HC-130 also provides a limited command and control link for all rescue assets during a rescue mission, and extends the range of the rescue helicopter by providing in-flight air refueling. The HH-60 provides limited search and recovery of the survivor in up to a medium threat environment, day or night. If a survivor requires immediate medical attention and cannot wait for the arrival of the recovery helicopter, threat environment permitting, specially trained Pararescuemen (PJ) can be airdropped to the survivor using parachute deployments. Once on scene, the PJ will stabilize the survivors and prepare them for recovery.",cbf64d164d8deb110174a9a54c2df4b97490622c,True,False,,,,,0,1650937450,,0,{},i67m4ei,False,t3_ubwboe,False,True,t1_i67839g,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ubwboe/russian_mi8_saving_pilots_of_crushed_su34/i67m4ei/,1650937467,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650908650.0,

Japan is an excellent example of running out of pilots before planes. Early in the war, Japan had both a technological advantage and an experience advantage with their pilots over the US. They didn't begin the planned kamikaze attacks until late in 1944, when attrition led to desperation. 

Training a pilot to be successful in combat is incredibly time intensive. Kamikaze pilots were trained in around 30 days. Their training only focused on taking off and how to effectively complete their suicide attack. Taking off was difficult because the kamikaze planes had a 500 LB bomb and would stall easily during takeoff. Their planes were only given enough fuel to reach their target and they had no machine guns. 

Some of the kamikaze pilots were willing volunteers but many men were conscripted. Others joined only out of fear of bringing shame to their family.

That gives us a range estimate over 4000 meters.

Draw your own conclusions. 

For example what are the odds for the tank crews being actually able to tell where the launch site is at that range? I'd say not too good...

And even if they did, what are the odds of actually hitting the incredibly small target like a Stugna launcher at 4000 meters? Probably statistically marginal.

It has the possibility of going through the thinnest sections of MBT currently deployed in many military forces worldwide, and I'd guess based on older RU/UA armor, that unupgraded MBT in this war are vulnerable to flanking.

If it were up against another IFV from other countries, other armored vehicles, artillery, light tanks, and medium tanks (those around 40 tons or under for medium, and around 10 to 20 tons for light tanks), it will likely penetrate with every shot with devastating effect given the rate of fire. At least that's my best understanding of it.

20mm, 25mm, and 35mm autocannons are also extremely deadly and comprise the most common sizes on IFV's worldwide. However, there are a few rarer models and turret options where the autocannons go up to 40mm and 50mm.

On naval ships, an extremely popular Italian manufacturer (OTO Melara) installs a lot of 76mm turreted autocannons on NATO ships (even some US ships despite all of the large US defense contractors and UK contractors with US business), from small patrol boats to large \~500m modern destroyer classes. They obviously don't have the same very high rate of fire, but are still amazing. Now imagine if they had a custom order for a dual barreled gun in a larger turret mount; it would be one of the most frightening gun systems on the sea, especially if you're also being targeted by a secondary 35mm autocannon (or more, some US ships can mount up to four of those), and one or two CIWS 20mm/30mm rotary barrel autocannons. Navy ships are next level scary within a few kilometers range.

Per my understanding, it says a lot about the lack of RU capabilities that UA even has medium to long range radar guided anti-air missiles at this point in the conflict. This means RU isn't running effective SEAD/DEAD missions to destroy them. Given that, it means they don't have the required radar-seeking munitions (US HARM missiles for example), don't have the countermeasures/jamming/electronic warfare capability for such missions, or don't have their pilots trained to execute these missions. Dodging radar-guided missile launches is an art form of altitude, speed, setting proper angles to the radar and a missile launch, proper training and awareness to try and visually spot the early missile plume when launched, and the knowledge of the enemy missile capabilities to know when it's realistically safe to assume you were able to lead the missile into the ground or lose the radar track via line of sight. Typically US pilots go into these missions with all of the intelligence required to pretty much know where the enemy SAMs will be in-theater, as to lower the risk of random radar missile launches surprising them.

Somewhere in that line of thought above, Russia isn't capable of doing that while it's core to US air doctrine in order to gain air superiority and a huge amount of combat air support.

RU jets still flying low is an absolute indicator of radar guided missile threats being significant. Meanwhile, your point on MANPADS isn't something I can agree on. Tens of thousands of them (along with the simple training/instructions to go with their operation) have been imported to UA, so it's not as if there's just one or two dudes in a bush that artillery can zero in on or know to shoot before the jet arrives. They will be scattered all over the country and in solid numbers. A jet has slightly better capabilities to even IR missiles given their flares, altitude, and speed versus helicopters, but it's still deadly. In fact, this Su-34 video looks to have very similar qualities to the other Su-34 videos released today of two pilots ejecting as the Su-34 crashed to the ground. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's the same jet.

On counter-MANPADS, I'm not aware of any reliable activity to counter them in a super-quick time frame. Even with counter-artillery radar and ground radar arrays, it still takes a couple of minutes to get that coordinate position to the guns, for the guns to set their fire, and to actually fire. Without a drone to assess the hits, it could be off by hundreds of meters and likely is as long as the MANPADS bros scatter after firing. If they're not literally running as fast as possible or driving away from that position after firing, I'd suggest they do.

I hope this helps, but again, a lot of speculation based on my own research.",adefda46869b5299b8af34f75bfd90b2caa94383,True,False,,,,,0,1650931732,,0,{},i678vll,False,t3_ubluo8,False,True,t1_i650pus,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ubluo8/su34_strikes_with_x29_airtosurface_missile/i678vll/,1650931746,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650902932.0,

False flag attacks to gin up support for the war need to be things that the avg citizen cares about. Most people aren't going to get super spun up about some oil tanks, but would care if a school or hospital or whatever was bombed.

Personally, if I were going to set off a fake attack to build support for the war I'd:

Fill a train or some buses with dead soldiers and maybe even some civilians.

Decorate the outside with banners about how they're heroes or whatever.

Put out a press blurb about how these best of the best soldiers are going home for Easter as a reward for their bravery

And then I'd fire bomb it.

It would be cheap, effective propaganda and it would launder some of these corpses they so desperately want to pretend don't exist.",fa97c36b305fa07d59b9b90750188516210d1f37,True,False,,,,,0,1650931364,,0,{},i6781iw,False,t3_ublknk,False,True,t1_i65wvmj,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ublknk/alleged_ukrainian_attack_leads_to_explosion_of/i6781iw/,1650931378,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650902564.0,

1. He claims Russia has been hitting ammo depots but provides no supporting evidence that they're successful.

2. He claims it is more than likely quite a lot have been destroyed when, to the contrary we know from combat footage, results on the ground, and media reporting Ukraine has a near inexhaustible supply of western supplied arms at every single front, EVEN ENCIRCLED MARIUPOL has been resupplied with new ATGMs, etc.. If so much is being destroyed, where's the beef? where's the evidence on the ground? 

3. ""Russia been hitting oil depots for a month now daily"". We have no evidence for this. In fact, we have seen very little footage of destroyed fuel depots, much less daily.  That doesn't mean it isn't happening, but we should see evidence of this.  In fact we have the opposite evidence that Ukraine isn't suffering from any shortages. We have continuing harvest preparation (a highly intensive process requiring a lot of fuel), a lack of Ukrainian requests for fuel from partners, a lack of Ukrainian equipment being captured without fuel, a lack of media reports of shortages, a lack of social media reporting on shortages, etc... Ukraine doesn't have perfect OPSEC, so why aren't we seeing a bunch of anecdotal reports of it? 

4. ""With railroad networks next it’s gonna be hard moving those weapons and a lot easier to spot for strikes.""  Railroads, as evidencfe from WW2 reporting are some of the hardest to interdict via air and some of the easier to repair. We know from expert reporting that Russia's air-to-ground is terrible. Also, if Russia had been able to interdict rail traffic and such an interdiction would sway the outcome of the war, why did it wait until Day 60 to start? A new commander sounds like insufficient reason.
