I mean, you can get worked up about it but no one is sending their son to die over several million people starving to death in a country they can’t find on a map. Now the countries where millions will starve to death might be willing to send their sons to try to avert that outcome, but they generally lack the means to project power beyond their own borders and the technology to feasibly challenge the Russian military (even in light of its poor performance so far). Turkey isn’t likely to let military ships transit the straits with the express mission of attacking Russia anyway, particularly if they were a flotilla of Egyptian…frigates, I guess, since I think that’s their largest commissioned ship right now? The Russians also seem to be stealing and selling the grain, which means it’ll probably reach the markets anyway and thus the prospect of war with Russia will be even less attractive.

I can’t read peoples minds.  Trump’s discussion with Ukraine sounded like a request to a friend to me not extortion.  I read it that he viewed Biden’s overt corruption as a threat to the country.  Let’s be clear — it is the Biden’s that got paid — not Trump.  Maybe it was a pathetic extortion attempt in a room full of people.  Is anyone that dumb ? I can’t know what he was doing.  But I do know what he actually did — he sent lethal aid.  Unlike any other administration. If not for Trump’s Javelins and Obama’s training of Ukrainian army since 2014, Ukraine would have been overrun in a few days.  Biden did nothing other than watch the buildup of Russian troops.

Finally Afghanistan.  The argument that Trump was going to do it too is not a serious argument.  Of course he was — that’s not the point— not even remotely close.  The point is that Biden’s policy execution might go down as the most incompetent execution of policy in US history.  There is no obfuscation or hiding from this.

Henry Kissinger: Ukraine must give Russia territory

Former US Secretary of State warns against the defeat of Putin as Western unity on sanctions frays badly By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Davos, Switzerland 23 May 2022 • 7:17pm

Veteran US statesman Henry Kissinger has urged the West to stop trying to inflict a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine, warning that it would have disastrous consequences for the long term stability of Europe.

The former US secretary of state and architect of the Cold War rapprochement between the US and China told a gathering in Davos that it would be fatal for the West to get swept up in the mood of the moment and forget the proper place of Russia in the European balance of power.

Dr Kissinger said the war must not be allowed to drag on for much longer, and came close to calling on the West to bully Ukraine into accepting negotiations on terms that fall very far short of its current war aims.

“Negotiations need to begin in the next two months before it creates upheavals and tensions that will not be easily overcome. Ideally, the dividing line should be a return to the status quo ante. Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,” he said. Advertisement

He told the World Economic Forum that Russia had been an essential part of Europe for 400 years and had been the guarantor of the European balance of power structure at critical times. European leaders should not lose sight of the longer term relationship, and nor should they risk pushing Russia into a permanent alliance with China.

“I hope the Ukrainians will match the heroism they have shown with wisdom,” he said, adding with his famous sense of realpolitik that the proper role for the country is to be a neutral buffer state rather than the frontier of Europe.",13fdb1826574803d0f436e750e53ec6e667d2427,True,False,,,,,0,1653348419,,0,{},i9qsbun,False,t3_uw9amz,False,True,t1_i9q4geg,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw9amz/kissinger_warns_against_the_defeat_of_russia/i9qsbun/,1653348435,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653319619.0,

One border crisis with belarus including middle-eastern immigrants doesnt put us on 'russian level' of ethical tolerance.

Again, I'm not even diving into common history of Ukraine and Poland. But european-to-european tollerance and friendliness is just a normal thing and is waaaay more common than being open to middle-eastern people.

I'm sorry that the lies have been proven false...but maybe learn to accept that and move on. Maybe all the lies don't have to be true?

And the bigger the country is, the more centralized and authoritarian their government is, the harder it is to rise up, let alone stop the war or prevent the war crimes from happening. 

It will take many many decades until the power in Russia will start to decentralize and their system will change its old ways, until people will be able to effect any of their government policies. The change will likely come from the top down, not the other way around. 

I don’t think that ordinary Russian people are too docile, indifferent or “privileged” to rise up and change the way things are, it’s just any attempt of revolt or insurrection will be smothered by the systemic suppression and individual lives ruined by special organized services. A countless number of their brave investigative journalists, government officials, lawyers have been gunned down for decades, immediately after any attempt to speak out, investigate and expose the past war crimes and systemic corruption.

Russian nationalist figures (including veterans and military commentators) are increasingly criticizing the failures of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine and are calling for further mobilization that the Kremlin likely remains unwilling and unable to pursue in the short term.

Russian forces around Izyum increased their tempo of air and artillery strikes and likely intend to attempt to resume stalled offensive operations in the coming days.

Russian operations to encircle Severodonetsk made minor gains in the past 24 hours, driving north through Zolote. Fighting is ongoing in Lyman (north of Severodonetsk) as Russian forces attempt to cut off Ukrainian supply lines

Russian forces will likely make further minor gains west of Popasna in the near future but are unlikely to be able to quickly seize Bakhmut.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive northeast of Kharkiv continues to threaten Russian positions and is forcing Russia to pull units from ongoing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine to shore up their defensive positions near Vovchansk.",f119a562ec34f1feb6212120d02e4a1499a20c83,True,False,,,,,0,1653347344,,0,{},i9qq546,True,t3_uwcy6r,False,True,t3_uwcy6r,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uwcy6r/russian_offensive_campaign_assessment_may_23/i9qq546/,1653347356,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653318544.0,

332,[],False,,Feuerphoenix,,,[],,,,text,t2_z3ota,False,False,"&gt;There is a very big difference between actual paying and drooping the the claims.  
Seems that Germany loves the half truth history like the one where you are protecting Russians and celebrate Russians as liberators when actually they were the next occupiers. Same for the war debts claim where Poland was forced to drop it by the Russian occupier because they already took for themselves half of Germany.

Well in that case Poland could have laid claims in when the 2+4 treaty was signed. But even then this is a completly separate issue from getting weapons for free.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Right now the front line is 1000 km long over just flat lands. The war right now because of those flat lands is a war of heavy artillery. All those weapons which Germany sent in order to reach Russian targets needs to go under a rain of heavy artillery shells and doing this without proper support form counter heavy artillery is just a suicide mission.  
So Poland at least gave a chance to the Ukrainians right now while Germany sent 7 f\*cking Panzerhaubitze 2000 for f\*cking 1000 km front line.  
So who is playing the dubious game?

Again wrong category. Nobody forced Poland to do that, the did it out of their own volition. The deal the German government offered was a ring switch to get Leo2s. They did not state the generation, although it would likely be one of the more modern ones. But having the audacity to not request, but EXPECT the lastest version to be delivered…let‘s just say this is not something you do when you want to keep good relations.

When it comes to the Phz 2000, maybe the German army is just a large pile of garbage and most of Germany was fine with that. So understanding now what you actually have is one core aspect of this awakening. And Germany is also not handing over all of their equipment, so they still have defensive capabilities. And again, no one forced Poland to hand over that much stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Of course they are not the only bootlickers. When you look to the biggest investors in Russian assets after 2014 somehow you will notice that they are the ones which are acting like they don't want cut all the ties with Putin and hoping that Russia will have a gain after this war so Putin will not could claim a victory.  
So is not just about the f\*cking cheap Russian resources is also about the blocked assets in the Russian market.

&amp;#x200B;

- Taiwan is arguably China’s number one foreign policy objective, securing it is a must for Xi/his successor.

- The war in Ukraine has likely changed how China views Russia (it’s likely China knew of the invasion beforehand and had some assumptions it wanted to test), and if anything it’s taught China about the levels of support the different western countries are willing to provide, and what they are willing to do to punish.

- China has been pursuing military reforms which would arguably better prepare it for a confrontation with the U.S.: introduction of the QBZ-191 (and variants), increasing body armour, modernising equipment such as helmets.

- China have known that there would be opposition from the US in the event of Taiwan, one would expect it to be factored into their calculations, despite the US’s rhetoric and aid to Ukraine, China continues violations Taiwan’s ADIZ etc 

Overall, China is a different beast to Russia, not just in terms of its military but it’s economic position, and their fixation with Taiwan will outlast the Biden presidency, if they deem it necessary, they will pursue a military means of reunification.

How does the US counter this? Unless it’s certain it wants to commit to a war (would require sole thing formal between the US and Taiwan imo), then it needs to ramp up the defensive aid to Taiwan, and perhaps even advising to ensure the best prospects of success when the time comes. Diplomatic channels should also be started to try and get the allies on the same page to impose a sanction regime on China in the event of aggression.",c5240f14b4836e5cf9f591d1a298ac86e90c7b0d,True,False,,,,,0,1653345612,,0,{},i9qmk7g,False,t3_uw9xi3,False,True,t3_uw9xi3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw9xi3/cant_imagine_biden_saying_flatly_that_the_us/i9qmk7g/,1653345630,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653316812.0,

They invaded Poland in 1939 and committed the Katyn massacre, Finland in 1939, Romania in 1940.

They invaded Hungary in 56 and Czechoslovakia in 68. 

Afghanistan in 79.

Chechnya in the early 2000s. TWICE !!!

Georgia in 2008. 

Ukraine in 2014.

Just because Trump was protected by his party and during the impeachment doesn't mean that the impeachment was wrong or unjustified. The process is broken, it doesn't mean a crime didn't occur. 

Imagine if the situation was reversed and Biden had threatened to pull weapon shipments from Ukraine to get dirt on Don Junior's Coke habit. Suddenly, impeachment is justified. 

And like I said, fuck Joe Biden. I'm well aware that he is at the root of many of the policies that have only deepened inequality and racial tensions. 

We're stuck in a two-party system because we have failed to upgrade our Democratic institutions. We need to get first past the post voting updated to IRV, eliminate the Electoral college, have the senate based and weighted on population, districting conducted by non-partisan methods, limit the SC terms to 15 years (for example) and expand the court.

European NATO countries did have a cooperative security arrangement with Russia that was supposed to deter conflict: Europe was and is dependent on Russian energy supplies. They would not agree to invade Russia because of the threat to their energy supplies, which Russia would turn off at the first threat of invasion. Invading Russia would only ruin Europe. 

This was the guarantee of peace and cooperation: mutual economic interdependence. It is Russia that is using their energy supplies to threaten European nations: accept that we can invade who we want, or we will turn off the energy tap. This kind of blackmail is unacceptable. This is why Europeans have reacted so decisively against Russia. And also why Finland and Sweden are joining NATO. They have recognized that Russia does not respect or even understand these types of security agreements. Russia has stated explicitly that they want to end these types of cooperative security arrangements and replace them with use of force.

&gt; Three months into the war in Ukraine, the first M777s - the most lethal weapons the West has provided so far - are now deployed in combat in Ukraine&amp;#039;s east.

&gt; American-made M777 howitzers - the most lethal weapons the West has provided to Ukraine so far - are now deployed in combat in Ukraine&amp;#039;s east.

&gt; Ukraine has been seeking more advanced weapons such as air defenses, anti-ship missiles and longer-range rockets, but so far the majority of aid has been in short-range systems like Javelin anti-tank weapons and artillery.

&gt; The Harpoons, made by Boeing Co., could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine&amp;#039;s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume.

&gt; He added that the weapons &amp;quot;Will hold at risk high-value Russian ships attacking Ukraine from the Black Sea or elsewhere.&amp;quot; Congressional sources and a U.S. official have said Ukraine&amp;#039;s Neptune anti-ship missiles are in short supply, so the Harpoons offer Ukraine more capability to push Russian ships back and begin de-mining operations.

In addition to the weapons the United States is sending, the French have promised Caesar truck-mounted howitzers, which are capable of quickly driving away after firing in a maneuver known as “shoot and scoot.” Slovakia has also pledged howitzers.
But the American M777, known as the triple seven, is likely to have the greatest effect for the quantity of guns provided, providing accurate, long-range fire when sufficient crews are trained to use them, military analysts say.
The bottleneck is training. The United States has so far trained about 200 Ukrainian soldiers in six-day courses at bases in Germany. The Ukrainian military divided this group roughly in half, sending some to the front and others to train more Ukrainians. Training soldiers for all 90 guns — the amount that are scheduled to arrive — could take another several weeks, said Mykhailo Zhirokhov, the author of a book on artillery in Ukraine’s war with Russian-backed separatists, “Gods of Hybrid War.’’
Smaller numbers of the computer-controlled, self-propelled Caesar guns from France will also help, Mr. Zhirokhov said, but learning to use them takes months. “Even the French think they are too complicated,” he said.
After the soldiers fired the M777, the gun was horizontal again, its barrel covered in camouflaging branches. “Move faster!” an officer yelled. The crew then ran, in case the Russians had fixed their location.

Military analysts say the full effect won’t be felt for at least another two weeks, because Ukraine has yet to train enough soldiers to fire all 90 such howitzers pledged by the United States and other allies. Only about a dozen guns are now at the front.
Arming Ukraine with more powerful weapons is a politically sensitive issue. The United States, France, Slovakia and other Western nations have been rushing in artillery and support systems — such as drones, counter-battery radar and armored vehicles for towing guns — even as Russia accuses the West of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine, and threatens unspecified consequences if weapons shipments continue.
Disagreements over how aggressively to confront Russia have cropped up in the Western coalition. France, Italy and Germany have suggested that Ukraine use the leverage of more powerful weapons to push for a cease-fire that might lead to a negotiated withdrawal of Russian forces.
Ukrainian officials have pushed back. They insist that momentum is on their side and that talks should come only after battlefield wins and recapturing territory — once an almost inconceivable idea that became more tenable after Ukraine’s military inflicted multiple setbacks on Russia even before the arrival of Western heavy weaponry. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an interview on Ukrainian television over the weekend, said a diplomatic solution would come only after additional military victories for Ukraine, along with an influx of weapons. The Ukrainian military has repelled Russian troops from Kyiv and from positions near the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, but is under intense pressure now in a more limited battle for control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.
“It’s like an automobile, not a gas-powered, or electric, but a hybrid,” he said of ending the war with a mix of military gains and talks. “And that is how war is: complicated.”
“Victory will be bloody,” Mr. Zelensky said.
In any case, diplomatic talks halted about a week ago, both sides said, throwing the outcome back to the battlefields. And not all has gone Ukraine’s way. Russian forces are now close to surrounding the city of Sievierodonetsk, threatening an encirclement of Ukrainian troops.
“I’m surprised people believe Ukrainian forces can absorb this level of losses and then be ready to go on the offensive right afterward,” Mr. Kofman, the analyst, said. 
Still, the new, longer-ranged Western artillery are the most powerful and destructive of the many types now being provided by NATO countries. They fire three miles farther than the most common artillery system used by the Russian army in the Ukraine war, the Msta-S self-propelled howitzer — and 10 miles farther if shooting a precision, GPS-guided projectile.
Out on the open plains of the east, a long drive over potholed roads and dirt tracks ends with jeeps pivoting quickly into a tree line.
Secrecy is paramount in the cat-and-mouse artillery duels that have defined the war in recent weeks. Soldiers waste no time piling fresh-cut branches onto the vehicles, as camouflage against enemy drones.
In the artillery duels, soldiers value not just range but the ability to quickly hide and move guns and supporting vehicles.
Since their deployment two weeks ago, the dozen or so howitzers operating in two artillery batteries had by Sunday fired 1,876 rounds, according to Ukrainian officers.
With a mix of airburst, anti-personnel fragmentation rounds and other types of projectiles, the Ukrainian gunners have destroyed at least three Russian armored vehicles, and by Colonel Kachur’s estimate killed at least several dozen Russian soldiers.
At the firing line in the trees, empty ammunition boxes and spent cartridges were scattered amid foxholes. Kalashnikov rifles leaned against tree trunks.
The officers didn’t say what they were targeting.
The purpose of the guns will be to grind down Russian positions and military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots and command posts, he said. Ukrainian soldiers say the howitzers will also save civilian lives by striking Russian artillery firing on their towns.
The types of Western artillery flowing into Ukraine now have several advantages over Soviet legacy systems, Ukrainian artillery officers said. Among the most important is their compatibility with NATO caliber shells, easing fears that Ukraine might soon run out of Soviet-standard ammunition now made mostly in Russia.",525b619efccfd82d10e88438cdd306fe246beb0e,True,False,,,,,0,1653340399,,0,{},i9qbcsi,True,t3_uwafpc,False,True,t1_i9qaric,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uwafpc/powerful_american_artillery_enters_the_fight_in/i9qbcsi/,1653340413,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653311599.0,

Military analysts say the full effect won’t be felt for at least another two weeks, because Ukraine has yet to train enough soldiers to fire all 90 such howitzers pledged by the United States and other allies. Only about a dozen guns are now at the front.
Arming Ukraine with more powerful weapons is a politically sensitive issue. The United States, France, Slovakia and other Western nations have been rushing in artillery and support systems — such as drones, counter-battery radar and armored vehicles for towing guns — even as Russia accuses the West of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine, and threatens unspecified consequences if weapons shipments continue.
Disagreements over how aggressively to confront Russia have cropped up in the Western coalition. France, Italy and Germany have suggested that Ukraine use the leverage of more powerful weapons to push for a cease-fire that might lead to a negotiated withdrawal of Russian forces.
Ukrainian officials have pushed back. They insist that momentum is on their side and that talks should come only after battlefield wins and recapturing territory — once an almost inconceivable idea that became more tenable after Ukraine’s military inflicted multiple setbacks on Russia even before the arrival of Western heavy weaponry. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an interview on Ukrainian television over the weekend, said a diplomatic solution would come only after additional military victories for Ukraine, along with an influx of weapons. The Ukrainian military has repelled Russian troops from Kyiv and from positions near the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, but is under intense pressure now in a more limited battle for control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.
“It’s like an automobile, not a gas-powered, or electric, but a hybrid,” he said of ending the war with a mix of military gains and talks. “And that is how war is: complicated.”
“Victory will be bloody,” Mr. Zelensky said.
In any case, diplomatic talks halted about a week ago, both sides said, throwing the outcome back to the battlefields. And not all has gone Ukraine’s way. Russian forces are now close to surrounding the city of Sievierodonetsk, threatening an encirclement of Ukrainian troops.
“I’m surprised people believe Ukrainian forces can absorb this level of losses and then be ready to go on the offensive right afterward,” Mr. Kofman, the analyst, said. 
Still, the new, longer-ranged Western artillery are the most powerful and destructive of the many types now being provided by NATO countries. They fire three miles farther than the most common artillery system used by the Russian army in the Ukraine war, the Msta-S self-propelled howitzer — and 10 miles farther if shooting a precision, GPS-guided projectile.
Out on the open plains of the east, a long drive over potholed roads and dirt tracks ends with jeeps pivoting quickly into a tree line.
Secrecy is paramount in the cat-and-mouse artillery duels that have defined the war in recent weeks. Soldiers waste no time piling fresh-cut branches onto the vehicles, as camouflage against enemy drones.
In the artillery duels, soldiers value not just range but the ability to quickly hide and move guns and supporting vehicles.
Since their deployment two weeks ago, the dozen or so howitzers operating in two artillery batteries had by Sunday fired 1,876 rounds, according to Ukrainian officers.
With a mix of airburst, anti-personnel fragmentation rounds and other types of projectiles, the Ukrainian gunners have destroyed at least three Russian armored vehicles, and by Colonel Kachur’s estimate killed at least several dozen Russian soldiers.
At the firing line in the trees, empty ammunition boxes and spent cartridges were scattered amid foxholes. Kalashnikov rifles leaned against tree trunks.
The officers didn’t say what they were targeting.
The purpose of the guns will be to grind down Russian positions and military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots and command posts, he said. Ukrainian soldiers say the howitzers will also save civilian lives by striking Russian artillery firing on their towns.
The types of Western artillery flowing into Ukraine now have several advantages over Soviet legacy systems, Ukrainian artillery officers said. Among the most important is their compatibility with NATO caliber shells, easing fears that Ukraine might soon run out of Soviet-standard ammunition now made mostly in Russia.",525b619efccfd82d10e88438cdd306fe246beb0e,True,False,,,,,0,1653340188,,0,{},i9qaw22,True,t3_uwafpc,False,True,t3_uwafpc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uwafpc/powerful_american_artillery_enters_the_fight_in/i9qaw22/,1653340205,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653311388.0,

Powerful American Artillery Enters the Fight in Ukraine
The most lethal weapons the West has provided so far to Ukraine are now deployed in combat. Will they make a critical difference for Ukraine’s military in a war that has mostly become an artillery battle?

POKROVSK, Ukraine — Camouflaged in a heap of branches cut from nearby trees, the weapon that Ukraine hopes will make a critical difference in its war with Russia is all but invisible from more than a few feet away.
Soon, a single round shoots out with a boom and a howling, metallic shriek as it sails toward Russian positions.
It is the American-made M777 howitzer. It shoots farther, moves faster and is hidden more easily, and it’s what the Ukrainian military has been waiting for.
Three months into the war in Ukraine, the first M777s — the most lethal weapons the West has provided so far — are now deployed in combat in Ukraine’s east. Their arrival has buoyed Ukraine’s hopes of achieving artillery superiority at least in some frontline areas, a key step toward military victories in a war now fought mostly on flat, open steppe at long ranges.
The American howitzers are chunky machines of steel and titanium swathed in hydraulic hoses and perched on four braces that fold up and down. They have already fired hundreds of rounds since arriving around May 8, destroying armored vehicles and killing Russian soldiers, Ukrainian commanders say.
“This weapon brings us closer to victory,” Col. Roman Kachur, commander of the 55th Artillery Brigade, whose unit was the first unit to deploy the weapon, said in an interview. Mixing confidence with an implicit plea for more weapons, he added: “With every modern weapon, every precise weapon, we get closer to victory.”
How close remains unclear, Western military analysts say. The arrival of the new weapons is no guarantee of success, as the Russians continue to engage in fierce fighting in the eastern Donbas region. Much depends on numbers. 
“Artillery is very much the business of quantity,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., said in a telephone interview. “The Russians are one of the largest artillery armies you can face.”
The United States said weeks ago it would provide the howitzers, but their use in combat has so far been mostly hinted at in online videos posted, mostly anonymously, by soldiers. On Sunday, the military provided The New York Times a tour of a gun line in eastern Ukraine, the first independent confirmation by international media that the guns are in use",03cecac44e3aace32c9543ad511c56518c4d3a5b,True,False,,,,,0,1653340131,,0,{},i9qaric,True,t3_uwafpc,False,True,t3_uwafpc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uwafpc/powerful_american_artillery_enters_the_fight_in/i9qaric/,1653340144,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653311331.0,

Hi there, do you have a link where I say anything like that? I did a quick custom google search for 24 Feb-24 Mar with my username exact string required and can't find what you're claiming at all.

&gt;Recently you said ua defence positions collapsed in the east.

I think I said that Ukrainian lines around Popasna collapsed and that I hoped reserves were being kept. You can see that comment here for context:

Well not to your analysis, but then again I don't care about your analysis lol. I care about objective facts that happened during the insurrection that aren't up for debates. 

I've yet to be at a single public forum in the U.S. where threatening to kill someone with a bullet to the head and walking around with zip ties (which implies taking hostages) is condoned. Only in the mind of radical rightwing extremists would this even begin to be ok. 

&gt;Was there any insurrection attempt? Absolutely not.

Absolutely, positively, yes. 

What I said above literally fits the definition of that:

&gt;: an act or instance of revolting against civil authority or an established government

[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insurrection](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insurrection)

I don't care what you **think**. I care about facts. 

&gt;Yes, we quite obviously have different definition of an insurrection. Mine is legal, yours is concocted by some hysterical talking heads on MSNBC.

No, mine fits the definition. Apparently the female protestor who got shot and killed because she wouldn't stop advancing was just hysteria? Laughable argument. 

&gt;Cultural things are not “extremely low on totem pole” culture dictates what society we will be living in.  


The shit that you described? Absolutely at the fucking bottom of the totem pole. 

I don't give 2 shits if transgenders want to consider themselves a male, swing their dicks fast enough to take flight, and then consider themselves a helicopter right afterwards. It affects me in absolutely 0 way. 

&gt;Sure you are entitled to your opinion about Gaetz. Just don’t accuse people who are not calling to burn him at stake of being some kind of immoral individuals. The guy is guilty of nothing. As of today.  


Well no. That's my opinion and I'll absolutely call him and them that. 

&gt;The double standards that I indicated above. Going from “believe every woman” when a mentally disturbed lady pulled out ridiculous accusations against a decent family man with not even a blemish on his reputation (Kavanaugh) and “well, we should give every woman a chance to tell her story but not every story is true” when it came to a certifiable sleazball with dozens of women accusing him of inappropriate behavior (Cuomo).  


""Believe all woman"", is official leftist policy? Where? Quote people in governmental cabinets please. I'd like to see your source. 

You're conflating bullshit culture war dogshit that you see on fox news with reality. 

**Now this is where its going to get good. Because I GUARANTEE you can't cite a single source for any of the following bullshit:** 

&gt;Obama did not need to be “subservient to white American” that’s BS. What Obama needed to do was to stay away from local issues where he made things about race.

source

&gt;He made them about race, not anyone else.

source

&gt; like it was with Trevon Martin and “white” Zimmerman, and so on.

source

I want to see  a source for any of those. Again, you are confusing bullshit culture war rightwing talking points. With what Obama or his administration actually said.

That's a personal problem with yourself. Not with what was said. As the saying goes:

&gt;I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you. 

.

&gt; Every controversy that occurred during his administration where a black individual was involved he always, without fault took the side of the black person without even hearing all the facts.

Lets go back to your Trayvon Martin comment and lets see what the FIRST thing he said about it was. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/obama-trayvon-martin-tragedy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/obama-trayvon-martin-tragedy)

His comments from the very next day: 

&gt;""Obviously this is a tragedy. I can only imagine what these parents are going through,"" he said from the White House Rose Garden.  
  
""When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.""  
  
Advertisement  
  
Obama said that all of America had some ""soul searching"" to do over the incident, adding: ""If I had a son he would look like Trayvon and I think they \[his parents\] are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.""

What race-baiting was going on there buddy? Feel free to explain. He doesn't even MENTION Zimmerman. Sounds like right-wingers are pissed that he brings up any racially charged killing. For any reason. Period. 

They'd rather pretend they don't exist, and Obama to not even acknowledge them either. 

&gt;I voted for President who would see me as another American, not separate us into “his people” and “white America”

Sounds like you did that yourself by creating imaginary enemies and ulterior motives where none existed. 

&gt;CRT is poison. And I am assuming (with a fair degree of confidence) that you have not actually studied it since you are defending it.   


Did I study CRT directly? No. Almost no one that has studied CRT even knows they studied CRT since it is heavily ingrained into civil rights teachings. 

&gt;Or perhaps maybe you did study it and agree with it. Gotta get the “white devil”, right?

And here we have it ladies and gentleman. Prime example of self victimization whilst race baiting. 

There is literally nothing you people won't project lmao. 

&gt;What isn’t true? That my premiums skyrocketed? Wow, why don’t you tell me how much I used to pay and how much I pay now. Much more for a shittier plan. ACA is a catastrophe, but sure YMMV  


Again, I don't give a shit if **YOUR** premiums went up. That doesn't change anything I said previously. Which is that the average premiums went up, **at a SLOWER rate than it had gone up previously.** This is something right-wingers conveniently like to leave out. That premiums have been going up for decades. Fun-fact. They went up under Trump, and they are still going up under Biden. Surprise! Astounding I know. 

That doesn't change the fact that Obama saved half a trillion dollars as of 2020. 

[https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20200313.368916#:\~:text=First%2C%20the%20good%20news%3A%20We,than%20one%2Dhalf%20trillion%20dollars](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20200313.368916#:~:text=First%2C%20the%20good%20news%3A%20We,than%20one%2Dhalf%20trillion%20dollars).

Russia has very limited resources in terms of its ability to make war. Their economy is crumbling, and once they run out of dollars to prop up the ruble it’ll become a rapid collapse. The sanctions and new restrictions on trade with Russia deprived them of access to the microchips needed to replace advanced weapons and they’re going to run into even more issues supplying spare parts to their troops. 

Then you have to factor in the morale issue. Russian troops have very poor morale due to a toxic culture within their military and an extremely top heavy command structure. They lack advanced aircraft and are losing an alarming number of the fighters and attack aircraft that they still have. Their drones are basically recreational toys with Sony cameras inside of them (Orlan 10s specifically). They have no significant allies and they’re losing support within the populations of Belarus and Kazakhstan. They’re losing far more officers than any professional force in any war since WW2. Their poor training is costing them thousands of lives, and their population is declining which means those lives are irreplaceable.

As Russia struggles to continue the war economically, militarily, and industrially, Ukraine will see more and more western support which means that more Ukrainians can join the fight instead of having to work building replacement weapons. Russia has to win in totality, all Ukraine has to do is not completely lose and then outlast the Russians like the taliban did.",283b64510a0fcdf2ecda974773fb849fd2e290b7,True,False,,,,,0,1653337792,,0,{},i9q5f5n,False,t3_uw52k3,False,True,t1_i9q3aj1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw52k3/as_for_the_latest_news_from_the_line_of_combat/i9q5f5n/,1653337808,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653308992.0,

Moskva was sank by a land based missle so the Ukrainian navy did indeed not do a thing. I'm not saying the Russians have not shown an absolute piss poor performance and are indeed a laughing stock. At the same time the soviets did a rather shit job in ww2 somehow turned out a victory. Napoleon had a near perfect career and then one day he was undone. The notion that the war is decided and done is a rather stupid one. You don't know what tomorrow will bring.  Everything could quickly go sour for the Ukrainians just as the Russians could have a total collapse of the lines but here we are still Ukrainians still dying in droves everyday becoming kings of more rubble and setting their own country back years and years while the Russian people aren't facing any major strife over the ordeal.

It's far more of dissuading most Russians from caring or even paying attention. There's a few Russians who do follow it - but they're far more like QAnon fans who believe in bizarre conspiracies.  But most just think all of this is nonsense and thus pay little to no attention to politics.

While that sounds crazy, most people in the US start becoming interested in politics in high school and college and trying to figure out what government is all about, perhaps supporting a candidate or following an election.  Frequently these young people become very passionate about an issue or candidate and there is a logic to what's being said.

But young people in Russia don't see that logic and don't see candidates that speak about issues they care about. It's all stupid and they ignore it.

Many fall somewhere in the middle and simply don't want to die.

But more needs to be done to help these guys surrender. Posting their stories online might help propaganda and Russian families encouraging their soldiers to surrender knowing they will be treated well.  The stories about Russian POWs being tortured and killed are heavily featured in Russian propaganda since they want their soldiers to believe they can't surrender.

Even without a large-scale mobilization, more Russian young men will be conscripted and getting out of service will be more difficult. The treatment of conscripts is brutal before they even are sent to war.  

The ability for those young men to flee Russia will help the war effort in the long term - think of it as the American draft-dodgers fleeing to Canada during the Vietnam War.

Sweden actually granted asylum for American draft dodgers and deserters in the late 1960s, but not many could make it all the way to Sweden. There was only about 1,000 who reached Sweden.

But Finland and other countries around Russia helping facilitate Russian draft dodgers and conscripts going AWOL would hinder Russian's ability to rebuild their military.

Every one of these young men that can be helped to flee the Russian military is one less Russian life lost and one less tool for Russia to use to kill Ukrainians.

But if there is a high enough volume, there may need to be some amount of organization of how to deal with tens of thousands of Russian draft dodgers and deserters.",4f2ffe1b3ffd52ab44963a89204f449e01d4c2ec,True,False,,,,,0,1653333180,,0,{},i9pung7,False,t3_uw6m80,False,True,t3_uw6m80,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw6m80/a_ukrainian_hid_a_russian_soldier_at_home_passing/i9pung7/,1653333197,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653304380.0,

&gt; Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comMay 23 - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on Monday he was concerned about what he called moves by the West to &amp;quot;Dismember&amp;quot; Ukraine, and accused Poland of seeking to seize the Western part of the country.

&gt; &amp;quot;What worries us is that they are ready, the Poles and NATO, to come out, to help take western Ukraine like it was before 1939,&amp;quot; Lukashenko said during a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

&gt; Poland is one of Ukraine&amp;#039;s strongest supporters, sending weapons across the border and taking in more than 3 million Ukrainian refugees.

1665,[],False,,MosesZD,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ud9i,False,False,"&gt;On April 14, 2022, the Ukrainians sank the Russian cruiser Moskva with a pair of Neptune anti-ship missiles. And that success posed an urgent question to the world’s major militaries: Has another age of warfare just begun? 

&amp;#x200B;

The British sloop HMS Egret was sunk in 1943 by a Henschel Hs 293 missile.  The Italian Battleship Roma was sunk by a Fritz X missile later that year.  Fifteen naval vessels were sunk by missiles during WWII.   Those WWII missiles were unpowered, radio-controlled glide bombs.

Since then missile technology has greatly improved.  But we haven't had much in the way of large navy combat. Still, 37 ships have been sunk in combat by missiles since then.  Most were small, patrol-boat types.

But the HMS Sheffield and the Atlantic Conveyor were both suck with Exocet missiles in the Falklands war.  The Sheffield probably would have survived but the people who were responsible for the defense of the ship were fucking off with the principal warfare officer and the anti-air warfare officer found guilty of negligence by the Royal Navy investigation board.

We've come a long way since then.  Both in capabilities and understanding you can't blow off briefings and, later, contact warnings which they did.  Then go screw around in the wardrobe or just fail to act because instead of engaging the defenses, you went to go look for the idiot in the wardrobe...

Anyway, the answer is no.  Everytime something like this happens you get it's 'the end of the tank' or the 'end of the ship.'

Weapon systems don't go away unless there is a replacement.  The aircraft carrier REPLACED the battleship.  The tank REPLACED cavalry.  

With what are you going to replace these ships?  These tanks?

Nothing invented yet.  Instead, you will find they improve the defenses.  Just like they in the early 1900s when the torpedo became a big threat to battleships!  They didn't scrap battleships because there was no replacement. 

Instead they invented the torpedo bulge which vastly lowered the risk of being sunk by torpedoes.  For example, it took at least ten torpedoes to sink Yamato.  That was in addition to all the bombs which caused internal fires that eventually caused a magazine explosion, the final killing blow.",a846781600bb36458e3a947e1bb873dec300b806,True,False,,,,,0,1653332448,,0,{},i9psy5m,False,t3_uw1wj8,False,True,t3_uw1wj8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw1wj8/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9psy5m/,1653332464,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653303648.0,

I think the Danish missiles were delivered as Block 1A and may have already been upgraded to Block IC. 

Block II is basically a complete new missile on the same airframe with better performance due to upgraded hardware and software throughout the system. You can upgrade a Block I to a Block II but it has to go back to the Boeing plant in the USA for a full rebuild, which isn't quick or cheap, and last time I checked the factory was at capacity and had a missile backlog. 

The fire control systems on the launchers would also need to be upgraded to Block II standard which would take a while. 

Harpoon Block I especially isn't very smart - basically you tell it where to go, and optionally a deceptive route to get there (using inertial guidance from the launch point only, no GPS/DSMAC etc), and when to start looking for a target - once it reaches its programmed target area and turns on the radar it will attack the first target it finds. 1960s tech, but quite effective against the right target and has a longer range than coastal artillery.

IMO, in the long run, meaning hundreds of years, I think nuclear war is unavoidable.  The only way it doesn't ultimately happen is if society breaks down to a point due to some other reason where it no longer has the ability to make or maintain nuclear weapons.

All it takes is one dying crazy man and enough people (probably only a couple) who are willing to follow orders.  Once you get beyond a single chain of command, some may launch and some may not but at that point it doesn't really matter.

Or, more importantly, all it takes is a misunderstanding (due to technical glitches or not) which almost happened several times in the short history of nuclear weapons.  Looking back at the close calls during the Cold War, we probably had greater than 50% of nuclear war breaking out.

&gt; Since the start of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union has provided a total of EUR 4.5 billion in financial support to Ukraine.

&gt; At the same time, Zhovkva noted that last week, the EU decided to introduce a new tranche of macro-financial assistance to Ukraine of up to EUR 9 billion, but it has yet to be approved by the EU Council and the European Parliament.

And yes again you would be correct there is in fact a hypothetical NATO defense against icbm. However back to the main point that defense is utterly useless because it would stop nothing near enough warheads to be of any use. You should also realize that the ballistic missle defense was never meant to defend against Russia even by NATO's own admission because surprise surprise it can't. Don't you think if we had this space age missle defense that could completely tilt a nuclear exchange in our favor we would finally rid the world of our mortal enemy of the last 70 years? Or perhaps  even if only a couple got through I'm sure the government would find a couple million less civilians a small price to pay to be rid of russia once and for all.

The US responds by destroying all the spares and forcing every company on the planet that sold cnc machines capable of making parts to install kill switches on it's machines.

GENEVA — A diplomat in Russia’s mission to the United Nations
in Geneva quit his post on Monday, expressing shame over
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and describing it as a crime against
both countries.

Boris Bondarev, a counselor in the Russian mission since 2019
who described himself as a 20-year veteran of Russia’s Foreign
Ministry, announced his resignation in an email 
sent to diplomats in Geneva on Monday. His resignation is the
most high-profile gesture of protest so far made by a Russian
diplomat over the war in Ukraine.

“For 20 years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns
of our foreign policy but never have I been so ashamed of my
country as on Feb. 24 of this year,” Mr. Bondarev said, referring
to the date that President Vladimir V. Putin sent Russian forces
into Ukraine.

The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine and in
fact against the entire Western world is not only a crime against
the Ukrainian people but also, perhaps, the most serious crime
against the people of Russia,” he added.

Diplomats in Geneva confirmed that they had received the
email. Mr. Bondarev, reached by phone after responding to a
message on his LinkedIn account, confirmed sending it to
several dozen colleagues at other missions and said he had
tendered his resignation Monday morning.

Mr. Bondarev, 41, is listed as a counselor in the Russian mission
on the website of the United Nations he sent The New York Times a copy
of his diplomatic passport to confirm his identity.
Russia’s mission to the United Nations in Geneva said that its
spokesperson was not immediately available, but that it would
soon issue a statement.

Mr. Bondarev, who dealt with disarmament issues and was
described by Western officials in Geneva as a mid-ranking
diplomat, delivered a bitter denunciation of Russia’s leadership.

“Those who conceived this war want only one thing — to remain
in power for ever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on
yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian
navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity,” he said
in a statement attached to his email to diplomats. 

“To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes.”
He added: “It’s been already three months since my government
launched a bloody assault on Ukraine and it’s been very hard to
keep my mind more or less sane when all about were losing",a0087df2340f70319568d91bdecc3920499888e2,True,False,,,,,0,1653326611,,0,{},i9pf8w6,False,t3_uw4gh7,False,True,t3_uw4gh7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw4gh7/a_russian_diplomat_resigns_never_have_i_been_so/i9pf8w6/,1653326624,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653297811.0,

Russia has unfortunately demonstrated time and time again not only that their word can never be trusted but that they are unable to follow any honorable rules of civilized modern warfare.

Russia can and should be properly condemned for a barely disciplined military that barely deserves its name and commits atrocious war crimes against civilians on a vast scale.

On your question of who the Russian people are, they seem outrageously apathetic at best and veering toward loving Putin’s fascist brainwashing at worst.

Interesting thread below on this very issue of Russian identity and responsibility with a Russian analyst blaming Russian citizens for their apathy and insisting they should feel 100% guilty for Putin’s war:

&gt; Science defines Fascism as a political ideology. It’s main pillars are nationalism, autarky and militarism.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin has sold nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Belarus, his ally in the war on Ukraine.

&gt; The deadly 9K720 Iskander short-range ballistic missiles are capable of delivering a devastating nuclear payload. Aleksandr Lukashenko, the president of Belarus who is friendly with Putin, said: &amp;quot;At the very least, this weapon can cause unacceptable, colossal damage.""

&gt; Lukashenko bought 9K720 Iskander nuclear-capable missiles and S-400 missile systems and says he plans to produce his own by the end of the year.

There is, however, a massive military-cost for understating them.   Therefore, always over-estimate.

History, OTOH, clearly shows us that the Russians were never up to US/NATO in tank design.  Hell, don't even get me started on the piece of shit that was the T-34, the most over-rated tank in the history of over-rating tanks.  But that's not for this forum.

As for the T-62, during the Yom Kippur war the Israelis lost 400 tanks, many of the tanks in their fleet (1700 tanks in total) were WWII surplus, up-gunned (75mm high-velocity) Shermans (300) redesignated as the M-50.   This upgrade made those tanks equivalent to the M4A2E8 (Firefly) of WWII and they were able to hold their own against the T-55s and T-62s.

Other Shermans (redesignated M-51) were upgraded to the 105mm gun and they, too, just cut-apart the T-62s like butter.  As did the Korean-era M-48s with the 90mm gun and the Vietnam era M-60s with the 105mm rifled gun.

The combined Arab armies using T-55 &amp; T-62s lost 2,300 tanks. The only advantage the T-62s had was in night-fighting with their infra-red searchlights.  But even then, the Israeli tank forces were able to out-fight the Arabs at night.

The bottom-line Russian tanks have many chronic design flaws they constantly reincorporated into their tanks.  They just never learn from their mistakes.

Poor armor that is over-hardened.  Poor optics.  Poor fire control.  Poor driving controls.  Poor internal layouts making them prone to cooking-off and burning up.  Russian tanks in WWII had a 75% casualty rate with penetrating hits, OTOH, US tanks had an 18% casualty rate on penetrating hits and because of superior design, out-fought their Russian contemporaries.",a034e4c9bbdadafffc74141d6fd522786cde01a7,True,False,,,,,0,1653324893,,0,{},i9pb5lv,False,t3_uvvpba,False,False,t1_i9o5anv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvvpba/according_to_this_mornings_uaf_update_russia_is/i9pb5lv/,1653324908,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653296093.0,

This is a nuanced argument tbh, lack of trade, VAT issues, etc. all point to long term economic hardship or even a collapse of a standard of living for cohorts inside Russia.

Patriot missle defense in Israel has a 50% succes rate and in Saudi Arabia has 80%. Sure there are otger systems at play in but not even together will they stop all inbound missles. Let's take the higher success rate of 80%  and say 100 nuclear tipped cruise missle are launched. We're gonna have 20 nuclear missles detonating on missle defense systems and radars in Europe. Why not launch 300 conventional warheads as well? Now we have a total of 400 missles. 80 will make it through. Sure there's the probability that the defenses hit all the nukes however that's just as likely they hit none of them. The outcome is most likely somewhere in the middle. The outcome is you probably have a few more nukes penetrating than before. This first wave has crippled missle defense in Europe after suffering 20+ Nuclear detonation and dozens more conventional strikes. Mind you no one will know these are nuclear warheads until they detonate. On radar they are the same as any other missle. Now that Russia has crippled missle defense and are surely about to be retaliated upon they launch the remainder of their nukes against a defenseless Europe. Yes the effect is Russia will be wasted as well but this myth that missle defenses somehow spared Europe is shattered. So by all means keep believing this fairytale. Now to the matter of Inter-continental ballistic missles the U.S. has 44 interceptors with an effective rate of 50%. Thank the lord well stop 22 nukes as 1200 more go screaming by.

The double standards that I indicated above. Going from “believe every woman” when a mentally disturbed lady pulled out ridiculous accusations against a decent family man with not even a blemish on his reputation (Kavanaugh) and “well, we should give every woman a chance to tell her story but not every story is true” when it came to a certifiable sleazball with dozens of women accusing him of inappropriate behavior (Cuomo).

Obama did not need to be “subservient to white American” that’s BS. What Obama needed to do is to stay away from local issues where he made things about race. He made them about race, not anyone else. Like it was with Boston professor and Boston cops, like it was with Trevon Martin and “white” Zimmerman, and so on. Every controversy that occurred during his administration where a black individual was involved he always, without fault took the side of the black person without even hearing all the facts. And many of those turned out to be completely inappropriate. I voted for President who will see me as another American, not separate us into “his people” and “white America”

Article: 

As Russian forces continue to take significant battlefield losses in Ukraine, the Kremlin is struggling to plug the gap as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains reluctant to call for a full-scale military mobilization. 

British military intelligence estimates that Russia has lost one-third of the ground combat forces it had gathered ahead of its invasion as Moscow’s forces have been bedeviled by both their own operational shortcomings and a fierce Ukrainian resistance, backed by sophisticated Western weapons. The U.S. Defense Department has not seen evidence of a mass Russian mobilization so far, officials said. But as Russia is trying to throw more forces into the fight, it is sometimes bringing in combat groups at less than full strength, including units that took losses in their failed effort to capture the capital, Kyiv.

In lieu of a mass mobilization campaign, which is likely to prove unpopular, Russia has cobbled together reinforcements by redeploying troops from occupied territories in Georgia, bringing in mercenaries from Syria, recruiting civilians in occupied regions in the Donbas, and coercing soldiers to stay on the battlefield by dangling financial incentives at new recruits. Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have also noticed Russia taking less experienced troops from more far-flung areas, such as the easternmost Russian port city of Vladivostok, instead of using elite units that suffered severe casualties in the beginning of the war. And the Pentagon believes that the paramilitary Wagner Group is active in the Donbas region. 
“They’ve been really scraping every barrel’s bottom that they can possibly find,” said Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute. 

Draft legislation posted to the website of the Russian parliament on Friday indicated that Russian lawmakers are set to weigh measures that would scrap the upper age limit at which Russians can sign up for military service. The amendment, introduced by the head of the parliament’s defense committee, Andrey Kartapolov, argued that it was necessary to recruit specialists with years of experience under their belts. The current cap stands at 40 years old for Russians and 30 years old for foreign citizens. 

For the first several weeks of the Donbas campaign, after Moscow’s disastrous effort to storm Kyiv ended in failure, Russia tried to overwhelm Ukrainian forces with strength in numbers on its flatter terrain by saturating targets with heavy rocket and artillery fire before sending in waves of ground units. But progress is falling far behind Putin’s expectations in the contested region, and Russian units are getting pushed away from Ukrainian border cities like Kharkiv. That’s leading to yet another change in Russian tactics. On Wednesday, a senior Pentagon official speaking on background under ground rules set by the Defense Department said Russia is beginning to scale back the size of its attacks using smaller units in the northern Donbas, likely in response to the heavy attrition sustained in the war so far. 

“The wheels are sort of coming off the Russian army,” Kagan said.

On Friday, British defense intelligence assessed that Russian commanders are under increased pressure to achieve their objectives, forcing them to redeploy forces exhausted by battle without sufficient time to replenish, risking further losses. British officials believe that in some areas of the Donbas, despite outnumbering Ukrainian forces by more than three to one, Russia’s poor integration of artillery and ground units has hindered progress, though Ukrainian officials believe that Russian fire has been effective in inflicting far more casualties than during its failed effort to take Kyiv. 

“They still having a problem delivering the effect they want, partly because of that integration challenge, partly because, if in doubt, go back to Soviet tactics of massive bombardments and barrages with fairly inaccurate artillery followed up by push yourself, turn [down] one road, and get whacked,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told reporters last week during a visit to Washington. “That’s what’s happening every day. They are not really progressing in many areas, … and their solution is just cannon fodder.”

Moscow’s increasingly mauled and ad hoc forces are likely to translate into further difficulties on the battlefield. “Even if he announced mobilization tomorrow, the attack currently underway will almost certainly culminate within the next couple of weeks,” Kagan said. “There just isn’t a wave of trained personnel that they can bring in that can really rejuvenate it in any short period of time.”

The senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Thursday that Russia had about 106 battalion tactical groups (BTG) fighting in Ukraine, the same number as earlier in the week. “They did push some units back into the Donbas that were not at 100 percent,” the official said. “We just had indications that not every BTG they put in was at the same level of readiness as before the war. Some BTGs were so depleted that they simply disbanded them and combined them into others.” Wallace, the British defense minister, said Russia had also tried to stem losses in units that ranged up to 35 percent—close to rates that would render most military units inoperable—by augmenting them with unprepared troops. 

Western officials believe that Russia has already put nearly two-thirds of its front-line ground combat units into the fight in Ukraine. But the senior U.S. defense official said Russia has still struggled to move large masses of troops because of failures in logistics and sustainment efforts. And some of Russia’s military failures in the conflict, including the sinking of the cruiser Moskva in April and the failure to seize Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has prompted Putin to suspend two top commanders. 

There are also rumblings of discontent within Russia. Russian military recruitment offices across the country have been targeted with Molotov cocktails, likely to protest Russia’s backdoor efforts to mobilize troops, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War reported on Thursday. Russia’s usually patriotic military bloggers have also come to question Moscow’s execution of the war, the institute noted last week, after almost 500 troops and 80 pieces of military equipment were lost in a disastrous attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River.

Lack of grid storage is a problem when it comes to getting from 60 to 100% renewables power. Right now you need base load plants as you say. These projects are exploding in popularity though. For example, Texas grid storage increased 200% in the last year.

Feelings are fine, and very human indeed, as long as they don’t dictate policy positions. One has to utilize reason, not feelings in that regard. “ Feelgoodism” rarely yields sound policy.

What follows in your post is really a hodgepodge of things some of which are absurd and really not supported by any appreciable segment on the right and some are quite legitimate but I suppose because you oppose them you think of them as something “bad”.  I have no energy or desire to address all this mishmash but I will try my best to address those that I consider the most misguided.

Calling someone “genius” does not equal endorsement. It only speaks on person’s intelligence. For instance, Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Hitler were all very intelligent people, some might even say geniuses based on the tasks they were able to achieve with resources they had. Yet all of them were bloody monsters and murderers. I don’t think Putin fits category “genius” but I have no doubt he is quite intelligent.

“Replacement theory” can mean many things. There is absolutely no question that several leaders on the left on record stating that “brownization” of America will bring about permanent Democratic majorities like it did in California. There is absolutely no question that after Immigration Act of 1965 white population segment in this country has been steadily declining while non-white immigrants steadily increasing. It’s not conspiracy theory, it’s a verifiable fact. Also, it is a fact that immigration from non-white majority countries have skyrocketed under current administration. So one could either believe all these facts are random and just happened without any thought behind it or one could believe it is a part of a plan. 

I don’t think one need to be disingenuous in argument, no one is “banning books”. Some books however have no business being taught in schools. Because kids do not have developed critical thinking skills and might perceive certain things they are taught to be true while they are not. For instance that men can have periods and abortions. We cannot, really.

“Sex SHOULD exist within monogamous heterosexual Christina marriage” - I believe this is a moral position that has been around for a couple thousand years. As long as those who do not follow it are not burned at stakes I have zero issue with it. No one burns you at stake in Alabama for having a boyfriend or a few so do not worry too much about it.

“Proud boys” can associate with whomever they want, right for free association is literally in our Constitution. If they do it crimes they must be prosecuted just like anyone else.

It is judge’s job to review and interpret law. If United States Constitution does not contain “right to abortion” it doesn’t mean that women shouldn’t be able to have one. It just means it’s not in Constitution. Many things that we enjoy is not in Constitution. Being able to have breast augmentation is not in Constitution either, yet women certainly enjoy it and in great numbers (I am all for it, by the way)

“Tried to overthrown elected US government”? You mean like an insurrection or something. That’s outrageous! Who tried to do such a thing?! I am sure those people were charged with insurrection and sentence to lengthy prison terms!!

*****
&gt; Huge losses in military equipment, coming close to 1,300 units of tanks alone, forced the russian army to switch to reserve battalion tactical groups with T-62M tanks, which are being removed from storage.

&gt; Last month Defense Express speculated that such old tanks would be sent to various checkpoints, but at that time russia&amp;#039;s losses were twice less.

&gt; Most likely, now the army of the russian federation is forced to complete new battalion tactical groups with T-62, as with the regular battle tank.

The Russians are failing at the concept, which is part of why they are losing so badly. You have to have aircraft carriers for rapid force projection. You have to armor and infantry to take and hold land. Infantry or armor by themselves are far weaker and easier to defeat than when they are used together. Effective airpower is essential to dominating a battlefield, something else the Russians seem unable to provide. The Russians are basically using older equipment and tactics, along with a primarily conscripted force. Ukraine military training has been done in partnership with western nations, and they operate more like western militaries.

If you look at a system by itself, they all have weaknesses. When forces are combined, they can address the weaknesses of other systems. An AA unit would be decimated by an armor unit. An armor unit would get destroyed by an air unit. But an armor unit with AA attached would stand a better chance against an air unit. 

I wish the military would quit trying to predict the future. During the cold war, they only prepared for near peer, leaving them unprepared for Iraq and Afghanistan. Now they have been prepping for wars more like Iraq and Afghanistan making them less prepared for Russia or China. We need to prepare for both.

If you really think about their actions in Syria, they could have largely received the same benefits by intervening to help the Sunnis rather than the Alawites in that civil war.

&gt;Last week, the UN asked Russia to open access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports – to allow grain exports to resume.  
&gt;  
&gt;The head of the UN's World Food Programme, David Beasley, suggested that keeping them shut was worsening a global food crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, Russia's saying that if it opens those ports, the sanctions imposed on Moscow will have to be reviewed, according to the Interfax news agency.

I'm a field project manager IRL. So my days can get crazy. So I do actually practice mindfulness meditation. Great stuff. 

&gt;“Insurrection” on Jan 6th? I am sure you meant “trespass on restricted federal property”. Because to the best of my knowledge so far not a single person has been charged with “insurrection” but many have been charged with trespass, which is a misdemeanor by the way. Let’s not blow this out of proportion.  


Oh. I guess you don't consider it an insurrection when members of congress where huddled into rooms fearing for their lives while there are pictures of crazies roaming the corridors with zip ties? Not an insurrection when there is audio talking from a protestor about looking for Nancy Pelosi to quote, ""shoot her in the brain""? 

I guess we have different definitions of an insurrection. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There wouldn’t be “a culture war” if a large group of mentally unstable individuals on the left didn’t push ever more insane ideas on this society  


So you admit its a culture war? IE: Something that is EXTREMELY low on the totem pole of important shit? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So you acknowledge that so far Gaetz has not been charged (let alone convicted) with anything illegal, correct? That’s what I thought.  


Not yet. I also said I sure as hell could form my own opinion outside of the court room. 

&gt;Sure double standards do not mean anything, it’s just “cultural b.s. from the right”. Really highlights the quality of your character.  


What double standards? 

&gt;My disappointment in Obama was not due to “GOP baby boomers” being upset with him, which was expected, my disappointment was that instead of bringing our country together he sown seeds of division that grew to extreme hostility between Americans that we have today.  


Well except that was 100% due to right-wing radicalization. They saw absolutely everything as a race issue. If Obama wasn't 100% subservient to white America. Then clearly he was, ""race-baiting""--according to them. 

Those tensions you mention? Yeah that was 100% due to the rise of right-wing extremism. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;CRT is far from a boogeyman. I studied it in law school, while it is absurd it is also dangerous if you utilize it in teaching young kids who do not possess the same critical thinking skills that a law student has. CRT is like a more mentally challenged offspring of Critical Theory, a Marxist theory that views relationships within a given society based on a socioeconomic class. Proletariat is perpetually oppressed, bourgeoise is the perpetual oppressor. CRT just switches out classes for races, so if you are okay with that garbage being pushed on young minds I am not. Furthermore, I have never voted in school board elections in my life. Until 2021.  


CRT is 100% a boogeyman. 

When Texas removes the requirements to study civil rights milestones in history. The Birmingham letters or his, ""I have a dream speech""--does that promote some sort of Marxist theory? Or are radical right-wingers whitewashing history as another form of the aforementioned culture war? 

&gt;Inability of GOP to produce a plan that would replace Obama Care is valid criticism. But one also must acknowledge that having no plan is better than having a horrible plan. My healthcare costs after Obama Care have skyrocketed. 

Well that's 100% not true. The statement of no plan being better than the current plan. 

That is hilariously stupid considering before ACA--getting covered if you had a pre-existing condition was almost unheard of. Or at least not without SKYHIGH premiums. 

That's just one example of why its stupid.

The overall increase in premiums that you mention? Sure they increased. The one thing that you and the right-wing media fails to mention is that they increased......AT A MUCH slower rate than in previous administrations:

[https://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/slower-premium-growth-under-obama/](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/slower-premium-growth-under-obama/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Republicans say the average family health insurance premium has increased by $4,154 under President Obama. That’s right — and it’s a much slower rate of growth than under President George W. Bush. In fact, employer-sponsored premiums have been growing at moderate rates for the past few years.

So what's your excuse for that one? You should be lucky that ACA existed to stifle premiums from spiraling even more out of control.

The reason premiums keep increasing is because healthcare costs are 100% out of control, and the GOP has 0 plans to address this, and provided 0 plan in 4 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Culture war bullshit like CRT? Or actual policies that affect almost all Americans and are always at risk of bankrupting Americans? 

Yeah I could give 2 shits about CRT in comparison. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is no adjective in English language to properly reflect it. So I would much rather had Obama to have no plan than the plan he ended up enacting. All while promising insurance premiums comparable to “cell phone bill”. Turned out to be just a lie.  


That's because you have 0 idea of what you are talking about and you have 0 statistics to back up your position. 

Don't agree with me? Ok then.

Rome, after getting their navy named the Mediterranean literally ""Our Sea"" because they could strike any foes anywhere right in their breadbasket. It was true then and it's true today (well more airpower but still).

So Russia has always wanted to be a European power and have always been hamstrung by not being able to project power into the world's oceans, things that even the tiny islands of Japan and Britain could do to historical highs, not to mention America and her endless coasts of just the nicest warm-water ports you can imagine.

So to say that Russia hasn't wanted that vital tool on their military belts is easy to reject on the face of it and can only be done so by being pretty pedantic about it.

3126,[],False,,shawnaroo,,,[],,,,text,t2_37ymx,False,False,"You also have to take into account the different circumstances that each of those regimes existed in during their peaks. The Nazis took power in a country that, despite being in economic hard times, was still one of the powerhouses of Europe and had a solid history of technological and economic success. They were also only in power for around 12 years, and about half of those were spent in the middle of giant world war, so it's a pretty unique situation.

The Soviets lost a lot of people during WWII and some of their western areas were certainly ravaged by the war, but they're a huge country and a vast portion of their country and industrial base was not destroyed during the war. And they occupied a big chunk of Europe in the years after the war, so they were well positioned to become an industrial and military superpower after all of that, and in the short term they did enough to take advantage of that situation and had some successes in some fields that they put a lot of effort into (like rocketry/spaceflight). It took a couple more decades before the deficiencies in their autocratic government really effected the country deeply enough that they started to fall noticeably behind. 

And China is pretty different as well, as they've made their rise in a world of globalization, where they were able to put their huge potential labor force in a position to become the manufacturing backbone of the world, and in doing so bring drastic improvements in the standard of living for the bulk of their citizens. My guess would be that even outside of something like a Confucian ideology, most people would be happy enough living under an authoritarian government to stick around as long as they're seeing consistent and sustained improvements in their lives. 

Russia's problems over the past few decades have not only been the western European influences, but also the fact that Putin's government has not been particularly effective at improving the lives of their citizens. His government purposely has not rewarded merit, but instead strongly favored loyalty to him personally. This leads to broadly ineffective governance, and massive institutionalized corruption. Except for a relatively small portion of the population living in a handful of 'prime' urban areas, there's been minimal improvement in the standard of living for most of its citizens. It's no surprise that educated and skilled people would not want to stick around.",579dcd1704d9200d7676059c3acefa6b5e659504,True,False,,,,,0,1653318702,,0,{},i9owfy4,False,t3_uvu4jo,False,True,t1_i9o8gwq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvu4jo/russias_economy_is_imploding_we_forecast_a_gdp/i9owfy4/,1653318717,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653289902.0,

ATGM's have been a force since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and tanks still rule the battlefield

&amp;#x200B;

The Ukrainian army has ATGM's but they are also fighting with hundreds, you guessed it, tanks. The same ones used by Russia

&amp;#x200B;

The marines have been changing force structures and missions as often as women change hairstyles 

&amp;#x200B;

anti-ship missiles have been around for decades too and we still have carriers which can outrange their firing platforms

&amp;#x200B;

The cult of the offensive goes back to the Prussian-Franco war when the French relied on defense and were outflanked. Their offensives in WW1 failed and most of the German ones succeeded because the germans used modern artillery and not horse charges

&amp;#x200B;

in WW2 the French had more and better tanks than the germans. and the germans actually came close to failure in breaking out of the ardennes. The germans had more radios and called up reinforcements faster than the French were able to do. even then the plan to attack through the Ardennes wasn't even close to their original plan and they had to kiss ass to hitler cause they know he liked bold stuff like this because most of the German general staff weren't crazy about it.

the British pioneered aerial naval warfare in the 1920's

“On April 14, 2022, the Ukrainians sank the Russian cruiser Moskva with a pair of Neptune anti-ship missiles. And that success posed an urgent question to the world’s major militaries: Has another age of warfare just begun? After 20 years spent fighting the post-9/11 wars, the United States military’s attention is again focused on a peer-level adversary. The Pentagon hasn’t been thinking this way since the Cold War, and it is attempting a profound transformation. Today, fierce debate attends this transformation, and nowhere more acutely than in the Marine Corps.”

General David “Berger believes a new age of war is upon us. In “Force Design 2030,” he puts the following sentence in bold: “We must acknowledge the impacts of proliferated precision long-range fires, mines, and other smart weapons, and seek innovative ways to overcome these threat capabilities.”

“The weapons General Berger refers to include the same family of anti-platform weapons Ukrainians are using to incinerate Russian tanks, shoot down Russian helicopters, and sink Russian warships. The successes against a platform-centric Russian Goliath by an anti-platform-centric Ukrainian David have elicited cheers in the West, but what we are witnessing in Ukraine may well be a prelude to the besting of our own American Goliath.”",d9c5de5a69f358f55028ea160a54257625b60af6,True,False,,,,,0,1653318081,,0,{},i9ov1aw,True,t3_uw1wj8,False,True,t3_uw1wj8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw1wj8/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9ov1aw/,1653318097,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653289281.0,

&gt; The four countries noted that the EU and like-minded countries have already frozen assets belonging to Russian individuals and entities and some $300 billion of central bank reserves.

&gt; &amp;quot;In cases where legal ways to confiscate the assets will not be identified, it should be used as leverage and released only once Russia compensates Ukraine for all the damages done,&amp;quot; the four countries said.

I don't believe the SU-25 model that they use even has a laser designator, just a laser rangefinder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, if you've tried working these weapons on DCS sim, you would see how impractical they are in this battle space just on basic principles of employment. They are not ""fire and forget"". You would have to be at a certain altitude (probably with air brakes deployed) as a sitting duck to MANPADS while you first acquire, then let the missile ride the laser beam to the target. Think of all the Stugna-P videos, except fired from a greater range, while in a plane. If you pull off the target, the laser goes over it's angle limits and the missle is no longer guided.

I haven't even seen any of these Vikhr's (and few precision AG weapons) launched from either side during the conflict. I think that one KA-52 that crash landed was carrying them, but employing them would be super risky.

Sure, let's do that.

No, there are no sources to corroborate that particular element of my claim because I don't think any Soviet leader was so fucking stupid as to say that outloud much less put it down on paper. 

There are many papers and books and pieces out there that make this point, that no one can find the Russians actually saying this therefore that must have not been any sort of policy! 

This of course falls apart when you look at things Russia has literally done, like leasing ports in Syria and moving a chunk of their navy there and then getting involved in the civil war to preserve the access.

Furthermore why wouldn't they want a warm-water port? What powerful nations doesn't? You really think Russia wouldn't do anything it could to get one? 

At the peak of Soviet power the idea that they could push south and salami slice their way to water wasn't outlandish, they had done it before they could do it again with a combination of soft and hard power. 

But alas the CIA remember how the Soviets helped the Vietcong and they introduced bin Laden to the Stinger and that was that.

“Insurrection” on Jan 6th? I am sure you meant “trespass on restricted federal property”. Because as far as I know so far not a single person has been charged with “insurrection” but many have been charged with trespass, which is a misdemeanor by the way. Let’s not blow this out of proportion.

There wouldn’t be “a culture war” if a large group of mentally unstable individuals on the left didn’t push every more insane ideas on this society

So you acknowledge that so far Gaetz has not been charged (let alone convicted) with anything illegal, correct? That’s what I thought.

Sure double standards do not mean anything, it’s just “cultural b.s. from the right”. Really highlights the quality of you character. 

My disappointment in Obama was not due to “GOP baby boomers” being upset with him, which was expected, my disappointment was that instead of bringing our country together he sown seeds of division that grew to extreme hostility between Americans that we have today.

CRT is far from a boogeyman. I studied it in law school, while it is absurd it is also dangerous if you utilize it in teaching young kids who do not possess the same critical thinking skills that a law student has. CRT is like a more mentally challenged offspring of Critical Theory, a Marxist theory that views relationships within a given society based on a socioeconomic class. Proletariat is perpetually oppressed, bourgeoise is the perpetual oppressor. CRT just switches out classes for races, so if you are okay with that garbage being pushed in young minds I am not. I will tell you more, I have never voted in school board elections in my life. Until 2021.

Inability of GOP to produce a plan that would replace Obama Care is a valid criticism. But one also must acknowledge that having no plan is better than having a horrible plan. My healthcare costs after Obama Care have skyrocketed. There is no adjective in English language to properly reflect it. So I would much rather had Obama to have no plan than the plan he ended up enacting. All while promising insurance premiums comparable to “cell phone bill”.

The USA didnt invade afghanistan to annex it. If you have different goals you commit different crimes. The US preferred to kill 100 civilia s if they could kill 1 Al Kaida member instead. Murder is murder, no arguing about that.

When you billet troops in a school it is no longer a school. It is a barracks. 

If you have children attending school while billeting troops in said school, during an open conflict, the end-state is obvious. 

When you shoot at people from a hospital it no longer is a hospital. 

Because of these ""rules"" anyone can bomb anything and say ""oh, well, you see, they shot at us from there.""

We did it in Iraq all the time. To be fair, they were billeting troops in schools.  They stopped billeting troops in mosques because those are actually important to them, vice schools, and we kept blowing them up. 

I loathe Russia with all my soul.  But, in warfare, what we deem as a violation of basic ""rules"" often becomes so twisted and mutilated, by the time it reaches the public, it's nothing more than propaganda on both sides.  

Side A: oh my god they bombed a school!  Here are pictures of the rubble and the dead. 

Side B: Here is your own footage from troops living in that school. 

Likely Facts: The school had been abandoned for weeks and was being used to simultaneously billet troops, house civilians and was a makeshift hospital and fuel/ammo/food depot. A separatist paid Yuri the equivalent of $10k to give its location up.  Reconnaissance finds the story valid and observes troop movement in and around the school.

&gt; Russian soldiers preparing to be sent to fight in Ukraine are required to buy personal equipment at their own expense, according to several servicemen who spoke.

&gt; The men interviewed by The Moscow Times said they were promised a monthly salary of about 200,000 rubles if they signed a contract to join the Russian troops fighting in Ukraine - but that they would have to buy all their gear themselves.

&gt; One Russian soldier who was in Ukraine at the beginning of the war told The Moscow Times that the shoes and clothing with which he was issued weren&amp;#039;t winter gear.

\- The majority of them are Anti Nato because of the bombings and will use every opportunity to side against it.  
\- For some reason, most of them regard Russians as a ""brotherly nation"" and are positively predisposed towards them.  
\- Since they hate Nato and the West they do not trust CNN, BBC, etc because it is ""Western propaganda"" so, ironically, they fall for pro-Russian propaganda instead.  
\- As a direct result of that, they are so brainwashed that the vast majority believes that there are Nazis killing Russians there, that Ukrainians have been genociding Native Russians for 8 years despite Putin's warning (yet there are no videos or proofs for that)  
\- They compare it to our ""plight"" saying "" Oh but they are only defending their people from oppression just as we have done in the Kosovo, Croatia, Bosnia, etc...""  
\- They also justify it by saying Putin warned Nato not to expand for decades and the West had it coming.  
\- They also accuse the West of having aimed Nukes and building up troops at Russia's borders for years (yet Russia is always the one threatening with nukes)  
\- Popular ""arguments"" are almost always whataboutism. Something like this: ""And what did Nato do to us?"" ""What did Americans do to \_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert any US intervention in history ever)""

Indeed. To elaborate, the main issue with laser weapons is size, weight and power supply. Aim at something and that something will be a bit warmer. Keep the beam on target long enough, and I expect whatever it's aimed at will get very hot. The idea's been around since the 50's.

The main question isn't if Russia managed to build a big laser but rather how portable it is, and if they're able to supply it with enough power once it's in place. Since it's Russia we're talking about I'm guessing a small nuclear reactor and a laser array on a train car... -.-",f173e3d8ced187f2d40f3274a0c8344be6eb4601,True,False,,,,,0,1653312910,,0,{},i9ojsvk,False,t3_uw0136,False,True,t1_i9oiph6,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uw0136/blinding_antisatellite_laser_is_serialsupplied_to/i9ojsvk/,1653312926,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653284110.0,

Then Syria, they started leasing ports and that lead to a relationship with the government which lead to Russia needing to prop it up, so when Assad needed a helping bloody iron fist Putin was happy to smash.

&gt; Russian forces in eastern Ukraine are intensifying attacks on a key city as they seek to seize the Donbas region.

&gt; On Sunday, local officials said Russian troops were repelled after trying to enter the city from four directions.

&gt; Speaking via video link at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Zelensky called for &amp;quot;Maximum sanctions&amp;quot; to be imposed on Moscow, saying frozen Russian funds should be used to rebuild Ukrainian cities destroyed by the war.

&gt; Captured soldier Sgt Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of killing Oleksandr Shelipov, 62, in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka on 28 February.

&gt; Ahead of the verdict, Shishimarin&amp;#039;s defence lawyer - appointed by the state - told BBC News no Russian official had been in touch with him.

&gt; At the time of the killing Shishimarin, 21, and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit.

The only sad part indeed, is that now these poor civilians in the East and PoW's are facing an uncertain future.   


However, with or without sentencing russian PoW's to life in jail, this won't make much of a difference for the way the Ukrainian PoW's and civilians will be treated. And russia has already proven this. They kill and torture for fun, it's the only ""victory"" they can gain in this war. They don't give a flying fk about their own captured soldiers.   


So, I believe it's time for Western Powers to pull the finger out of their arse holes and stop this ridiculous idea of ""I don't think we should do that, because they would do it 1000 worse..."". And we, as ordinary citizens should do the same. I know it's comfortable to say this while you are away from rockets, destruction and death, but being afraid of russians is what gives them satisfaction and motivates them to ramp up the terror against Ukrainian Nation and the rest of us.  


It's such a shame that death penalty isn't a thing in Ukraine...Maybe their leaders don't give a fuck about their lives, but I am pretty sure that ordinary russian soldiers would probably think twice about the consequences if they would see what happens with those who commit war crimes.  


They are doomed anyways, that's for sure. But the sad thing is that this war will still continue for a while...and sadly innocent people will be among the most affected ones as a result...we need to support Ukraine the best we can and make this stupid war stop ASAP and hold the guilty ones accountable.

They all had deeply entrenched ideologies that allowed even educated people to accept the authoritarian rule.

The chinese have, and have had for a long time, a confucian ideology. A very simplified explanation of confucianism is that the people should trust the government, and the government should prove themselves worthy of the people's trust. 

The soviets had their version of marxism which claimed that the authoritarian vanguard party would eventually lead the Soviet Union to communism.

The nazis had the much simpler ""us versus them"" approach, using an external enemy (the communists and jews) to stoke fear into the population and causing them to band together into one giant tribe.

The soviets and nazis were spreading a lot of propaganda to build and maintain their ideologies. The problem modern day Russia is facing today is that they are attempting the nazi external enemy approach, but russian society is already too influenced by neighboring Europe.

All parties agreed to drop further claims 1953 and move on from here. And that was acknowledged again 1970. You just look like a fool when you bring up that topic. And let‘s not forget here that Germany was the PiS-Party‘s favorite evil to paint on the wall.

There is a very big difference between actual paying and drooping the the claims.

Seems that Germany loves the half truth history like the one where you are protecting Russians and celebrate Russians as liberators when actually they were the next occupiers. Same for the war debts claim where Poland **was forced** to drop it by the Russian occupier because they already took for themselves half of Germany.

&gt;3. Right now Poland is playing a very dubious game of „let others pay for modernizing our army“. And as it looks like Germany is saying they won‘t do that in the way Poland wants. And rightly so. Reading through the articles this looks like a cheap way of getting some hype against Germany again.

Right now the front line is 1000 km long over just flat lands. The war right now because of those flat lands is a war of heavy artillery. All those weapons which Germany sent in order to reach Russian targets needs to go under a rain of heavy artillery shells and doing this without proper support form counter heavy artillery is just a suicide mission.

So Poland at least gave a chance to the Ukrainians right now while Germany sent 7 f\*cking Panzerhaubitze 2000 for f\*cking 1000 km front line.

So  who is playing the dubious game?

&gt;4. You should really be careful of calling others bootlickers, especially Germany after seeing this gigantic shift in the security policy. Are their free of blame? No of course not, a lot of stuff should be handled more transparent and faster. But calling them bootlicker implys they are on your opponent‘s side, which is not the case.

Of course they are not the only bootlickers. When you look to the biggest investors in Russian assets after 2014 somehow you will notice that they are the ones which are acting like they don't want cut all the ties with Putin and hoping that Russia will have a gain after this war so Putin will not could claim a victory.

So is not just about the f\*cking cheap Russian resources is also about the blocked assets in the Russian market.",c7d772b680ee2accb4c1bb675e65ab386baff703,True,False,,,,,0,1653306339,,0,{},i9o86gb,False,t3_uvdh5e,False,True,t1_i9nzf1k,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvdh5e/germany_will_provide_ukraine_with_lethal_weapons/i9o86gb/,1653306354,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653277539.0,

How?

Go to an exchange in person and online, and sell or buy the rubles, that's the effective price, it's not a misrepresentation, it's exactly the money you will get. Also, just to point out, every single national currency out there is manipulated or pegged and central banks sell and buy foreign currencies 24/7. Switzerland has been devaluing artificially the swiss franc for decades, e.g., consistently buying foreign currencies, especially to promote exports.

&gt; I would also point out that confidence is everything with global business and this thing they do to prop the rouble up is done for internal political/propaganda reasons. In terms of inspiring global business confidence or attracting finance it actually does the opposite,. You can only steal once from foreign investors and foreign corporations in your country, after that no more free lunch.

That's a two way road.

Didn't foreign banks freeze assets worth hundreds of billions? Weren't Russian estates and yachts and goods, frozen or seized in many countries?

What do you think wealthy individuals from Russia or other countries will do when they see that? That they should not do business in London and risk their assets to be seized. They should not buy expensive yachts and pay insane money to european shipyards and ports.

You may not make those assumptions but others  could apologies in advance if you arent of that type.

But Lots of redditors are completely misinformed on the refugee situation becuse their media and their politicians use it as a means of domestic gain.

1 Refugees should be able to freely cross from Turkey to EU. As long as they are migrating to a safer more stable environment, its against basic rights to block them. Unless you want to say Turkey is going to give the same quality of life and social development and freedoms EU does ?


2 The EU is asking made a deal with Turkey to act as a defacto refugee camp for the EU. It has denied the refugees this basic right. The EU is both morally and legally wrong, not Turkey. And amnesty reported it as an illegal deal.

https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/06/eus-reckless-refugee-returns-to-turkey-illegal/


3 what is evident here, is Turkey has expectations of support from the EU to do this. Nobody does anything for free. And when the EU pusses them off. They refuse to act as a camp for the EU.


Turkey isn't launching refugees into europe when a spat happens, what its actually doing, Is dropping what is basically an illegal deal, and granting refugees their legal right if passage to more developed nations as Turkey is legally required to do so.


What we have here, is a case of the EU getting mad when Turkey actually adheres to international law. And cutting deals with Turkey to deny basic rights to refugees in order to save their own political careers inside the EU.

China is already looking at the start of both population decline (similar to Japan) and a rapidly aging population. We found out this year from official CCP numbers that the fertility rate is below 1.5 well below the projected numbers. Even with the 2 and 3 child policy changes and some places even being offered cash for third child and paid maternaty leave. The fertility rate has still been rapidly dropping. This is normally an easy problem for governments to offset through immigration. However, I dont China adopting a mass immigration policy anytime soon.

Although China could definitely succeed in taking Taiwan. It would not be without mass casualties of young men and women aged 18-30. You can see how that would make an already big problem much worse, right? 

Do you think fertility rates falling has an easy solution? Nope. Just go look at global fertility rates and individual fertility rates by country.

The infrastructure is just missing, especially for the landlocked countries in central Europe. There are pipelines from Russia into Hungary, East Germany, Czech Republic and so on which are straight connected to refineries, which turn oil into diesel and gasoline. These pipelines and the infrastructure in there in place since the 60s or 70s and usually still owned by Russian firms. If you cut that oil, you cut almost all diesel and gasoline production in a local area. And just to reduce the consumption of diesel is almost non practical, since the hole industry runs on it, like tractors and trucks essentiel for food supply. And that bringing diesel in trucks run with diesel in certain regions is an very inefficient way to solve the problem should be pretty obvious. The are often solutions to partially fix that, but there are rarely enough pipeline to get the oil from ships to these refineries. For many countries its a task for 1 to 5 years to completely replace Russian oil and oil products like diesel. It more of a question what is acceptable. And Urban is just a selfish...

For natural gas it is on the short term even worse. I mean the big boy Germany doesn't even have on LNG-Terminal, and would need up to 5 to replace Russian natural gas. I mean they bought 4 of these LNG-Terminal-ships from 5 available on the world market and building the infrastructure as fast as they can, but the first two will be ready late in the next winter, the earliest. And then its even questionable  until when there will be enough supply through LNG ships. I mean you can partially replace it with more natural Gas from Norway and the Netherlands, while also using the LNG terminals from other countries. But is really limited, and there are just not enough pipelines from Spain through France into Europe. Spain has the most LNG-Terminals in Europe, but France where blocking and slowing down building pipeline because natural gas is the biggest competition for nuclear energy as an transitional energy in the near future. So Countries like Austria, Germany and Italy can't get there gas from there either. 

So Money is not the problem, it is the infrastructure that is missing. For many countries it is either  natural gas and diesel from Russia (or Russian oil) or none at all for quite a while.",e8b53c57c8d0834388005bc803149bb543d50b39,True,False,,,,,0,1653301400,,0,{},i9o1i9i,False,t3_uvw3m9,False,True,t1_i9nxzyi,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvw3m9/germany_wants_russian_oil_embargo_with_or_without/i9o1i9i/,1653301415,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653272600.0,

Germany needed the energy, their foolish closure of their nuclear power plants forced them to this.

You mean, France tends to sell weapons on market closed to the USA ? 

The commercial positioning of France in term of weapons is to be a ""3rd choice"" when you don't want to rely only on US weapon, or don't want to have a diplomatic problem with your neighboors.

Typical example is the UAE : the USA want them to stop any trade with China, especially in the communication domain (the whole Huwei 5G war). But, it's not really in the UAE interest to just be an US ally, they prefer to have a multi-polar network (and it's pretty smart if you want my opinion here). 

So, the USA tell them to go see someone else for weapons if they don't want to accept the whole US package.. Here comes France ! 

Plus, the Rafale is really the best aircraft of the world.

That's true. Also a part of the problem is that the Beschaffungsamt which is responsible for all the aquisitions of the Bundeswehr always goes for the more newest stuff, which isn't fully developed and tested. That leads to delays in the production and problems with the systems, an example of this would be the Puma.


&gt;I think corruption is to blame and the CDU/CSU is the most corrupt party of all

Yes the CDU is corrupt but the Beschaffungsamt which is responsible is extremly corrupt, which is the main problem.

&gt;CSU has been close with Putin as well, even closer than the SPD.

No way the CSU is closer with russia than the SPD. The SPD has blocked harder santions against Russia in 2014 after the annecation of the Krim. SPD minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriell sold german gas reserves and gas infrastucture to russian companys in 2015. And don't get me started on Schwesig and Schröder.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comDAVOS, May 23 - German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has warned Hungary against blocking efforts to impose an European Union-wide embargo on Russian oil imports in response to the war in Ukraine.

&gt; Among the 27 EU member states, Hungary is the most vocal critic of the planned embargo on Russian oil.

&gt; The Commission has proposed phasing out Russian oil imports by the end of the year in most EU member states, while Hungary and others could be given more time.

You just look like a fool when you bring up that topic. And let‘s not forget here that Germany was the PiS-Party‘s favorite evil to paint on the wall.

I dream (and all my ukrainian and russian friends, in Central Europe) there will be a change for the best. But there are several issues: 
- his close people seem to be the most extreme with their vision of novorussia and shit like that
- a democratic leader would have huge support from the population (2 solutions: give money to people equally while ending corruption -good luck- ; or start the nationalist shit that russians love since thymey are brainwashed from even before school. 

Of course we are so many to want people suffer for what’s they have done. And trust me, i have ukr friends fighting now (my best friend, im sure you will win and come back alive for your daughter, i always kinda pray for you and our colleagues there ….and their grand parents refugees here. All those folks are super smart. They told me stories…. Well, sometimes they didn’t finish. It wasnt bs propaganda, they were talking about neighbors and relatives. 

Anyway RU will have to pay back. But I’not very optimistic. The economy will be chaos. Hunting money from gov, corrupt and oligarchs would be amazing. But having small population far from cities (it’s still middle age here, reaally , a friend from siberia tells me it’s more and more shitty), having those folks long term suffering will make nationalism bigger than ever. They just want to have enough food from their garden and not being sick, that’s their life in countryside. 

So, the new leader would have to… idk… repair (how can you repair nightmare and death) Ukraine, while having his country solwly back to normal and health. We had both experiences:after ww1 we pressured germans and got hitler. Huge help after we2 and we have germany…

I have no advice, i’d say the challenge will be insane. And Russia is not a country like others. They are fed with patriotic shit and all have a quarter of the fanily killed by their own government for no reason since many generations.  And I doubt tsarism was much better. They are so used to be treated like that, say yes to the dictator while looking away, looking nowhere.

Marshall plan? Ukraine will need one. As long As I am  very close to this land , it often is a shithole. And that was before the war. No doubt they will receive some help.

But Russia? The new guy in charge would have to change everything. Of course restrictions should move at some point and collaboration between all countries be the best. Isolate russian ruined post war will make a new putler in months. 

And even though… this nationalist poison is in RU for so long.. Good luck to change this into positive stuff. I mean my wife is czech and one day one tech guy from her company came for a business trip. Well educated, smart guy. Well, he was still believing that Prague invasion in 68 was to defeat nazis. He didnt/couldnt hear a different version, it was completely unrealistic. So what propagandra Putler is doing now will have some impact whatever the situation is.

Again, slava ukraini, i love you my friends and admire your courage, as promised i help the way we agreed.

Sweden and Finland joining NATO will cause the war to be prolonged is another point made. Sweden and Finland joining NATO will have no impact on the duration, it is a war of attrition now. The Ukrainian military is growing and getting more and better weapons. The Russians cannot replace their losses. Ukraine morale is high, Russian is low. Ukraine will win before the next winter. Probably less than 3 months at the current rates.

The fact is that nuclear weapons are becoming more likely just because Putin knows he can't win. He has doomed Russia for several decades, they will probably never be a super power again. They will be forced to suckle from China going forward.

More NATO allies will actually make the world safer. China is watching and the more countries that come together in support of Ukraine, the more China will temper their aggressions towards Taiwan.

Their professional force is still huge, their NCOs and COs are all professional. And there is a gigantic amount of them.


They have 18 fully professional light infantry commando brigades. Fully professional Marines The ones we see in Syria with elcan Specters etc on their rifles so they are well equipped. That's just over 90 thousand well equipped professional troops with advanced light infantry training, all of whom have multiple deployments. And that's not even all of their professional formations.

They cannot get a promotion unless they do a combat deployment every 3 years and they must complete combat deployments with each new rank also or it's not possible to be promoted.

Both navy and airforce are professional.

The professional units which are used for expeditionary combat operations are well trained. 

And outside of the US, Turkey is the only other military in NATO to have demonstrated a capability to conduct Multi Domain warfare in actual combat against a conventional enemy. This is a studied and reported on occurrence. The reason it was reported on was becuuse Multi Domain warfare is a relatively new concept even for the US military back in 2020 when Turkey demonstrated it.

*****
&gt; For more than a decade, Kirill&amp;#039;s critics have argued that his formative experience of religious repression during the Soviet era had tragically led him into Mr. Putin&amp;#039;s empowering and ultimately inescapable embrace, turning the Russian Orthodox Church under Kirill&amp;#039;s leadership into a corrupted spiritual branch of an authoritarian state.

&gt; The Rev. Cyril Hovorun, an Orthodox priest who was a personal assistant to Kirill for a decade, said the tarnishing of the patriarch&amp;#039;s reputation was interpreted by Kirill as a message from the Kremlin not to cross the state.

&gt; Mr. Chapnin, who had been personally appointed by Kirill to run the church&amp;#039;s official journal, began criticizing him and was fired in 2015.Like Mr. Putin&amp;#039;s Kremlin, Kirill&amp;#039;s church flexed its muscles abroad, lavishing funds on the Orthodox Patriarchates of Jerusalem and Antioch, based in Syria.

And Scholz didn't really say they will deliver heavy weapons. It's the media that announced suggestions and ideas as some definite promise. Or other figures of the government said they are trying to make it happen.

Now why is he stalling? Well that's a good question. But it definitely appears to be logistics issue, also tied with Germany's unfortunate dependency on Russia oil/gas. But now that they're ridding the dependency I notice Scholz is becoming more and more vocal. Ukranian troops are on German soil for special training. And so on. There also appears that decades long under funding of Bundeswehr left them at pretty bad shape in terms of maintenance and availability. What is this kicking and screaming accusation about?

Your submission, to the following post: The Best Kind Of Russian Soldier... The DEAD kind! Ukraine Soldiers Kill... in UkrainianConflict has been removed for the following reason:

This sub hopes to foster informed and intelligent discussion of the facts. Please do not submit scads of poorly evidenced, emotive or blatantly biased things.

The nature of the Ukrainian conflict means that such content is often valuable. However, it's important to tag it so that people can avoid it if they so desire. Yes, you should still tag a video titled ""EXTREMELY GORY VIOLENT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION"" as NSFL, even though it's obvious (it allows reddit clients to hide thumbnails).

No death mongering of any kind; will result in an immediate ban. 

If a submission lacks an original title or has a biased original title (e.g. a tweet or text submission), the title you use must be strictly descriptive of the content.

Yes they did, aa i clearly stated. 


&gt;Also keep in mind that the cdu always needed to coaltion with others 

The reason i wrote this is because in the sentence after i explained that there was no political will to keep the Bundeswehr in fighting shape, meaning that no politicians wanted to spend much on defense. Even in their 2021 election campaign the SPD clearly stated that they won't increase defense spending, especially not up to the 2% Nato goal. Yeah Merkel didn't care for the state of the bundeswehr either as long as it was capable of the foreign military operations in afgahnistan and later in mali.

 But the point i am trying to make is that no politicans from all parties wanted to raise the defense budget and that budget is one of if not the main factor why the bundeswehr is in it's current shape.

The bodies of the two Russian officers lay on the pavement for an hour in Melitopol city centre before the sun rose and their comrades picked up the courage to come and collect them.

A few hours later a hand grenade detonated next to the building where the Russians had set up their headquarters. A gunfight ensued in broad daylight before the attackers melted away.

The city, in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, is the third largest occupied by Russia since the invasion began in February but a fierce Ukrainian partisan campaign has prevented the Kremlin asserting complete control there.

The same day, Wednesday, members of the resistance blew up railway tracks ahead of an armoured train carrying Russian troops, munitions and vehicles.

Before the war Melitopol was a city famed for its cherry orchards and honey. Now it has a different reputation. Since falling to the Russians in March it has become one of the most active centres for underground resistance operations in Ukraine.

This week partisans claimed credit for the assassination of the two high-ranking Russian officers, bringing the total number of killings in the area to 100.

Ivan Fedorov, Melitopol’s exiled mayor, said that the attacks were directed with the help of the Ukrainian special forces and military leaders in Kyiv.
“The earth will burn under the feet of the invaders,” warned Fedorov. “The armoured train is just the beginning.”

Last month the special operations division of the army established the Centre for National Resistance to recruit, support and co-ordinate local partisan groups in occupied territories.

Its website offers advice to guerilla fighters on subjects ranging from how to disassemble and reassemble a Kalashnikov to surviving a phosphorus attack and stealing and operating a Russian T-72 tank.

• Russia-Ukraine war: latest maps, pictures and video
A section on sabotage advises ordinary citizens to put a few grains of rice or wheat into the fuel tanks of enemy vehicles, which will cause the engine to seize up.

Another section for those wishing to contribute non-violently, recommends making threatening anonymous phone calls to Russian bases, warning “the day of reckoning is near”.

A manifesto for the national resistance organisation states: “Together, we will quietly destroy the enemy. We will do it where he does not expect it, where he feels safe. We will teach you to conduct reconnaissance and gather information about the enemy.

“Yes, we are at war with a strong enemy, he outnumbers us, he can temporarily capture a city. But he will never be able to keep him, because we will be waiting for him in every house. And we will release every metre of our land, step by step.”

The development of a cohesive resistance movement may well be met with some concern among the Russian military leadership, whose older members will remember how costly guerilla warfare was for the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

In an attempt to suppress mounting resistance, the Russian security services — working in conjunction with local collaborator governments — are waging a campaign of intimidation and conditioning.

Last week Chusa Ruslan, 35, an interior designer, was abducted from his home by officers of the Federal Security Service (FSB).

Ruslan, who had been a member of the local volunteer defence unit, was believed to have been taken to the Russian headquarters and has not been heard from since, Ria Melitopol, a local news service, reported.

Sinister billboards have appeared around Melitopol celebrating Pavel Sudoplatov, the Stalinist agent who organised Trotsky’s assassination in 1940 and who was born in the city.

The strapline reads: “He knew what to do with banderites!” — a slur used to describe Ukrainian nationalists.

FSB officers carried out house-to-house searches across the city on Thursday after the wave of attacks as they hunted for the perpetrators. Young girls were subjected to humiliating body searches, local news reported.

Russian troops have also handed out leaflets with instructions on how locals should behave during the “special military operation”. Ukrainians were told to keep away from Russian soldiers and their armoured vehicles and to give them the right of way on the street.

To avoid “propaganda and disinformation from Kyiv”, the leaflets said, Melitopol’s residents should watch Russian state television, and the Telegram channel of Vladimir Solovyov, one Moscow’s most famous propagandists.",26b98cbc88d040c28e347536534d65b7062f11ff,True,False,,,,,0,1653280906,,0,{},i9ncyej,False,t3_uvq3mx,False,True,t3_uvq3mx,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvq3mx/partisans_wage_guerrilla_war_in_russianoccupied/i9ncyej/,1653280916,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653252106.0,

Tl;dr:
As President Zelenskyy said, ""I need ammunition, not a ride.""

Real talk... For years, Ukraine has been asking Western countries (U.S. and many others) to provide them with heavy weapons, modern weapons, longer-range artillery (as in the video) and the necessary ammo, training, maintenance and support. Ukraine has long asked other countries to seriously consider the Russian threat at their doorstep. I think many of us might ask, why did so many countries wait so long, after Crimea, after the Donbas, to support Ukraine sufficiently so they can defeat the Russians and regain freedom as a sovereign nation?

Not until most recently have the US and many other supportive countries (including UK, Europe, Aus, et al) committed to provide heavier and longer-range weapons - when leaders recognized Putin's clear blunders in strategy, and execution. 

I would be amiss if I didn't recognize those of you who have sacrificed and are working to support Ukraine. Thank goodness for our countries (American here) who are aiding the Ukrainian people, and I thank all of you who support Ukraine in your own ways. Slava Ukrayini. Слава Україні. I'm just trying to understand this as I imagine many of you are.

There seems to have been a tipping point, perhaps in the first week of the war, when Western leaders looked at their intelligence, and concluded, 'Hmm, Putin has badly miscalculated, and it's likely that he will continue this barbaric path of invasion and domestic crackdowns because he cannot afford to lose.'

Perhaps American leaders figured, 'So yeah, it's day 4 of Putin's folly. let's provide Ukraine with the weapons they've been requesting. Zelenskyy is really something, right? And this is certainly a great deal, especially compared to Afghanistan (brrr). David must just beat Goliath, if we finance this racket, as Butler used to say, y'know, if we do Lend Lease and get Congress on board. The ol' military industrial complex is chomping at the bit, so let's ship 'em the big guns.'

Perhaps Western leaders considered public support, saw that their people largely supported Ukraine, and then built their coalition. A sufficient number of leaders (and their respective parliaments, parties, supporters etc.) had to reach consensus to present a united front against Putin. They all had to stand up to the bully just as Zelenskyy and Ukraine had done during that first cold week in February. They fought fiercely, mounting a defense that has earned them respect worldwide.",b13110a8ab4be6ac00c2529a9fb9c171e2ebff92,True,False,,,,,0,1653280094,,0,{},i9nbphy,False,t3_uvnonj,False,True,t1_i9mljln,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvnonj/putins_army_getting_obliterated_by_western_weapons/i9nbphy/,1653280106,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653251294.0,

I would disagree with about the fight in the heartland. Imphal was most definitely in the eastern heartland of India (similar to the fighting in east Ukraine), and most definitely forces were massed on the Imphal plain. Slim chose that as the theater for war because he knew his forces were at an advantage fighting out in the open vs jungle fighting, at least in the initial stages of the battle and eventual campaign in Burma.

He also did fight with tanks: his mantra was that if you were going to use them you should both use them in number and accompany them with infantry - something the Ruskies were not doing in the early stages of the war.

Yes, he focused on getting his infantry off the roads because the Japs were holding them up, then hooking around through the jungle before attacking the flanks. This is principally why, tactically speaking, the Brits were getting their asses handed to them in the initial stages of the Burma war.

Slim was not a fan of Wingate because he felt that training special forces took men and resources away from infantrymen.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s war could kill between 50 and 100 Ukrainian servicemen in the East region every day, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said on Sunday.

&gt; Zelensky and the Polish president also discussed &amp;quot;Defense support for Ukraine,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Strengthening sanctions against Russia&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The steps we need to take to achieve our common goal - full membership of Ukraine in the EU.&amp;quot;.

&gt; Zelensky looked ahead to the new week as he prepared to &amp;quot;Join the discussions at the Davos Forum.""

&gt; WASHINGTON - Ukraine will receive from the United States MIM-104 Patriot a surface-to-air missile [SAM] system, 18 155mm howitzers, 18 tactical vehicles to tow those howitzers, and three Hughes AN / TPQ-36 Firefinder weapon locating mobile radar systems.

&gt; These include nearly 100,155mm howitzers, 200,000 artillery rounds, 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, about 5,000 Javelin anti-tank guided missile systems, 700 Switchblade tactical unmanned aerial systems, and much of the stockpile of Soviet-acquired weapons purchased after the fall of the Iron Curtain, including anti-aircraft missile systems such as the S-300.

&gt; This version of the air defense system has optimized radar search algorithms and is the first system in the Patriot family to use the MIM-104C or PAC-2 missile.

Situation regarding the Russian invasion as of May 22, 2022 (22:00) - # ZSU, 88 days  
  
In the Zaporozhye direction there is a decrease in the intensity of hostilities. The enemy regroups to strengthen certain areas. However, the occupiers tried to improve the tactical position of their units. They fought in the settlements of Komyshuvakha and Vasylivka.  
  
Martial law and general mobilization in Ukraine were extended for 90 days - until August 23. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are preparing for counter-offensive actions.  
  
During the day, as a result of artillery shelling by the Russian occupiers, there were 4 fires in Pologi and Vasyliv districts of the region.  
The first fire broke out in Huliaipil: a garage was burning, where there were 4 cars, a hayloft, and the house was damaged by fire. Two more fires occurred on the territory of Orikhov's private households: a farm building, a garage and an outbuilding were on fire. Rescuers from the State Emergency Service put out another fire in Vasylivka.  
  
In addition, due to Russian fire attacks, the gas pipeline in Vasylivka was depressurized. Rescuers blocked the gas pipeline at the gas control point.  
  
In Orikhiv, the shelling damaged water supply networks. However, specialists are already working to eliminate the city's water supply problem as soon as possible.  
  
For the past 24hrs, 10 curfew violators have been detained, including 9 men and one woman. Three men were taken to the military registration and enlistment offices, where they were handed summonses.  
  
In the village of Novohorivka, Vasylivskyi district, residents are reporting an increase in the number of Russian servicemen. The occupiers sat in the school and house of culture. The situation is the same in the village of Inzhenerne, Pologi district. In Husarka, the Russians settled in abandoned houses, made a detour yesterday, and then looted the houses from which they left.  
In Vasylivka, the number of Russian soldiers already exceeds the number of locals. At the same time, the occupiers continue to plunder the civilian population, taking away from their homes everything they like.  
  
  
The self-proclaimed head of Energodar's ""people's administration"" Andriy Shevchyk was injured in an explosion in the entrance of the house where his mother lives. None of the residents of the entrance were injured in the explosion, which leads to the conclusion that the guerrillas were waiting for the collaborator and hit him accurately and purposefully. The traitor and his bodyguards were then taken to hospital with various injuries.  
  
After an attempt to explode in the entrance, the occupiers began searches - looking for a red Audi and two young men, as well as intensified the search at checkpoints. In addition, until May 24, all car owners are forced to remove tinting from cars. Otherwise, they face fines.  
  
The occupiers in Berdyansk are trying to seize local business and divide it between themselves and their collaborators. Owners of cafes and restaurants who left the city and refused to cooperate with the enemy were left without their property: the Russians decided to take it in favor of the so-called ""city administration"". As a result, the institutions were transferred to the management of collaborators.

The normal way a rogue country is dealt with in NATO is to basically ignore that country until the problematic leadership runs its course and a new leadership brings that country back to its senses.

A couple of ideas come to mind. Meanwhile Sweden and Finland do have NATO like defense pacts so there's no real emergency.

Pretty sure there is an election coming soon in Turkey, so interested EU parties may be able to help free Turkey from this shitcunt dictator that has destroyed Turkey's economy, slaughtered tens of thousands of innocents and ruined Turkey's standing. Promises of new business and support, funding the opposition, promises of new era if there is a new leadership etc could completely abate any need to contain Turkey.

Also two can play the game of fuckery, so EU could counter Erdogans fuckery with cancelled contracts, political pressure such as exposing their heinous crimes (Turkey has multiple genocides underway) and military blunders by supplying the defenders of Turkey's present invasions of Syria, Iraq, Armenia and NGK. We know Erdogan is corrupt so plenty of options there seizing assets under the guise of international law. Frame the 'Turkey' problem as a human rights issue, recognize the genocides Turkey has committed etc etc. The political pressure should aim to affect domestic politics. EU membership could be used as a carrot, then Turkish rug pull the cunt after.

Ukraine should stay out of this fuckery until the war is over as they have a critical defense need supplied by Turkey presently. But they should always remember Turkey is NOT a reliable partner in its current form. Ukraine will need to built its own UAV fleet and diversify this so it can not become a bargaining chip in Turkey's next bit of fuckery.

Turkey is a mirror image of Russia, genocides a-plenty, thieves, will use any opportunity to fuck with people. It's sworn enemy - Russia - should be more than enough for it to overlook genuine human rights concerns of EU nations driected at Turkey, because they know they are fucking degenerate mass murderers.

Erdogan has had fifty years to deal with its concerns with Sweden and Finland so its entirely a hypocritical opportunistic game play.

First: There's literally nothing here suggesting the Russians have 'picked' this chip for anything. 

Second: Just because it exists and isn't American doesn't make it an alternative. Chinese electronics firms are dependent on western equipment and have already shown they're not willing to their entire business by helping the tiny Russian market circumvent sanctions.

Third: The Russians _already have_ their own processors (the Elbrus-8S(V) and probably-not coming soon Elbrus-16-something) which can run x86 instructions (plus a weird native VLIW instruction set). Slowly. And unlike the KX-6640MA, they're already using it. They also have an explicitly announced strategy to move everything critical (government/military machines) over to domestic microprocessors, even passing a law that it has to be done by 2025. Which was never realistic, but there it is.

In short, Russia's ""import-substitution"" strategy is completely screwed in the long term since they can't fab their latest microprocessors themselves (although older models, maybe, depending on how sanctions hit their domestic fab Mikron). But if someone would fab chips for them, they'd produce more of their own and not buy Chinese ones.

In reality it's unlikely they're going to be hindered so much from buying ordinary computers anyway, as the export restrictions are too weakly controlled. They can just buy stuff from Kazakhstan; there are no custom checks on that border.",4093c03e91a14970414042dfbb3f9c15baff44cd,True,False,,,,,0,1653267256,,0,{},i9mnrjm,False,t3_uvo8nh,False,True,t3_uvo8nh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvo8nh/russia_picks_a_slow_chinese_x86_cpu_to_replace/i9mnrjm/,1653267270,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653238456.0,

If some governments shift further from anti democratic in the distant future, they can still be a valuable alliance partner if lets them feel protection fortheir own borders, but also prevents them from carrying out any border wars of their own keeping their neighbors protected.

The main point of concern I have is if a declining democracy starts picking fights with neighbors. They might try to provoke an attack that could invoke article 5 and the alliance needs to stand firm against acting in provocations or allowing members that cause them.

Depends entirely on how many shells ukraine has

Using your available shells to bomb a random tank or a tank column makes a big difference in how you use it. You also have to take things like replacemeant rate into account. Ehen wiol that artillery unit get new shells to use? Maybe they wobt get new ones fast so wasting them on a sibgle tank means 5 hours later they dont have enough to bomb a big russian attack because replacemeant shells havent arrived yet do to supply problems. 
And at the end that was clearly not artillery. Is called using artillery for effect and not for random targets. If ukraine has so much ammo to waste they are apparently in no dire need of western weapons it seems.
And the cost of one russian tank is rather irrelevant if those artillery shoots could have been used for a more important target or are now lacking on another fronline because they have already been wasted.
That was my point with that.

&gt;1. There is a war.
2. That was an enemy tank.
3. You kill your enemies

I dobt deny that. I just question why they make a happy video about that for entertainmeant. War has nothing good in it at all.

This article hits the nail (Erdogan) on the head !
Now is a good time to move to a new NATO-version-2, where we rethink NATO vision and mission. 

NATO ""Alliance” is can no longer be based on anti-USSR, but must be based on shared values: Democratic values; Anti-Dictatorship, Anti-Corruption, Rule of Law; Press Freedom; Human Rights. 

 Friends need to agree on the big issues. The important stuff. The big picture, right?

Obviously, Turkey being just such an oppressive dictatorship, will not be invited to join NATO-version-2, but is of cause welcome to stay (alone) in the old NATO.

Turkey blocking Sweden and Finland, is great. I mean, the ball would start rolling; NATO crises; Turkey hung out to dry; Hugely important debate about NATO vision and mission; End of NATO; Start of NATO-version-2, with all the good guys only - i.e. no dictatorships, Turkish dictatorship liability. 

If Turkey does the blackmail thing, calling political refugees ""Terrorists” (anything dictatorships don’t like is always terrorism), well…, we don’t pay attention. Anyway, when do you need to pay attention to Orwellian Dystopias wannabes? I.e. except as a threat that need to be dealt with?
