The paramilitary brigades rose up during the 2014 invasion of the Donbas because Ukraine's military was out matched and I feel like the government was scared to over commit to a fight that they felt like might be a slaughter.   
The more militant citizens formed brigades and armed themselves to fight.  
The better lead and effective ones like the Azov brigade were formally inducted into the national guard after a review procedure to deal with issues that they didn't want to have in the armed forces.   
I also now see I used Azoz Mechanized infantry brigade it should be Azov.  
I don't really know about the command structure, they likely fast tracked the men who were natural leaders in the brigade into officer school but also added a number of experienced officers and NCOs to help the unit integrate with the Ukraine command structure.  
The current highest ranking officer in the battalion was a platoon leader in the Azov brigade during the fighting in 2014.   
One of the fundamental issues is strong nationalist tendencies give rise to a willingness to fight and die for your country - while it's not the only reason people join the military, it is the one that is most easily twisted into xenophobia and belief in superiority. Once nationalism twists into hatred of those who are not of your group, its a quick path to neo-nazism.",193238a76af8d69b6429450799c4b8930dcf5310,True,False,,,,,0,1650662834,,0,{},i5suunm,True,t3_u7ybew,False,False,t1_i5qxebd,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u7ybew/mariupol_azovstal_steel_works_my_thoughts_and/i5suunm/,1650662848,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650634034.0

It says draw close to God and he will draw close to you. He told me not to fear man, who can kill the body but not the soul and that the meek would inherit the earth. The book also made it clear what things would look like in these days with wars and reports of wars, food shortages, and disease, and frankly it's hard to ignore especially when combined with the destructive tendencies of man.

This being said tho, I want zero affiliation with the dominant ""christian"" groups we see today. The message has been hijacked and weaponized for control and profit. A message of love and compassion is now division and hate.

I will point out that in the Bible, the religious leaders of the day, were pretty much always the bad guys including murdering Jesus.  Much like we see today, these same entities clothe their badness in robes and ceremony, but lack authenticity and mislead many simply by creating such a terrible representation of what Christianity is. Mired in scandal and controversy, with zero credibility to the world. This is not a problem just for Christianity. The Muslim would can certainly understand when they see their faith twisted into ISIS. It is no wonder or surprise that general sentiment is rushing into an agnostic/atheistic default, and I completely understand why and it's a shame.

Christianity is practiced at the personal level, and because of my feelings towards this, I try to love my enemies and have compassion for my fellow fucked up humans, even in Russia.

I realize who is in control of this planet right now. He has come down in great anger, knowing his time is short.

[],False,,spiderfarmer,,,[],,,,text,t2_548lp,False,False,"The Netherlands will be completely rid of the purchase of Russian gas and coal by the end of this year. For the coming winter, the gas storage facilities will be filled as much as possible. ""We are in the middle of a war and we have intervened,"" explained State Secretary Vijlbrief of Mining after the Council of Ministers.Last year, the Russian gas company Gazprom underfilled Dutch reserves. ""Of course, we all suspected that Russia did not do so because of European gas dependence and the planned war with Ukraine,"" says Energy Minister Jetten.Prices soared and the cabinet had to come up with compensation schemes. That's not going to happen to us this year, the cabinet decided.  
Putin's war chest  
The accelerated additional gas purchasing must be done in large part by energy and other companies. Insofar as they don't dare take the financial risk because gas is currently very expensive, the cabinet will come up with a scheme that partially compensates for the price difference.""But those companies themselves are also saying that they want to stop lining Putin's war chest,"" says Jetten. He is convinced that it will work.  
The state-owned company Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN) will fill the Bergermeer gas storage facility to 70 percent of its capacity, insofar as the companies do not do so despite the arrangement. The total costs depend on the prices on the gas market and are estimated at 623 million euros.These will be 'recouped' through a levy on gas. This bill will initially fall on companies. ""But it may be that they pass it on in part through their prices to the consumer,"" says Vijlbrief.  
Gas terminals  
More lng (liquid gas) may also be imported. This is stored in gas terminals in Rotterdam and Eemshaven. Energy conservation and sustainability must also help to replace imports from Russia.For coal, the import for the entire European Union already stops on August 11. This was agreed in the fifth EU sanctions package in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
The phasing out of the purchase of Russian oil still has to be arranged at EU level, but here too the government is striving for a stop at the end of the year.Jetten: ""Other European countries should also have the opportunity to phase it out, but ultimately we are aiming for a ban on all energy from Russia.""",e6e41a6357abba27b4cbf46b063c0a5f69979c9c,True,False,,,,,0,1650635610,,0,{},i5qz6lq,True,t3_u9f7tt,False,True,t3_u9f7tt,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u9f7tt/the_netherlands_will_no_long_use_any_russian_gas/i5qz6lq/,1650635623,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650606810.0

&gt; WASHINGTON - The mounting economic damage to Ukraine from Russia&amp;#039;s ongoing bombardment has the U.S. and its allies speeding billions in aid to the beleaguered country - and looking for other sources of cash as well, including Russia itself.

&gt; After the U.S. announced $1.3 billion in new economic assistance and military aid to Ukraine on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged that &amp;quot;This is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild.""

&gt; On Wednesday, Yellen and Ukraine&amp;#039;s finance minister walked out of a Group of 20 meeting as Russia&amp;#039;s representative started talking.

I don’t pretend to know much about Germany or have any sound economic expertise. But look those arguments (first two, from Polish press):
1. [Thomas C Theiner tweet](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1516545893805273091?s=21&amp;t=tno74nCbQFJ4fGTNv0gh1w) (read all 7 parts of it), summarizing German Chancellor’s Olaf Scholz “efforts” of delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine. Than read his conclusions at the end: “Scholz isn't incompetent or mendacious... he just works for the Russians”.  1) At the end of February Germany's defense industry sends Scholz a long list of all available weapons. 2) Scholz doesn't share the list with Ukraine. 3) Scholz says that there are no more weapons left in Germany to give to Ukraine. 4) Germany's defense industry leakes the list to Ukraine's ambassador. 5) Scholz says that the weapons on the list don't work. 6) The defense industry denies this and leakes the list to the press. 7) Scholz states Ukrainians can't master the weapons in the available time. 8) German defense experts tell the German press that Ukrainians can master the weapons in 2-3 weeks. 9) Scholz says the weapons are needed by NATO and NATO must approve their transfer. 10) NATO officials and German generals deny this. 11) Scholz says no other NATO/EU ally is delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine. 12) The US, UK, Australia, Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, Turkey, Italy, Finland, Denmark, Romania, Netherlands, etc. publish the lists of heavy weapon they deliver to Ukraine. 13) Under pressure Scholz announces €2 billion for Ukraine's military. 14) German parliamentarians find out that it's really just €1 billion, which won't be available for another 2-3 months, and then Scholz can veto or delay indefinitely every item Ukraine wants to buy. 15) The US, France, Poland, Romania, Japan, the UK and Italy, plus the heads of EU and NATO spend an afternoon trying to talk sense into Scholz. 16) Scholz makes a statement and says Ukraine can have the €1 billion now and order whatever it wants from the list. 17) Ukraine's ambassador says that Scholz removed all the items Ukraine actually wants from the list before giving it to Ukraine and what remains on the list is just a fraction of the €1 billion.
2. [Bruno Macaes tweet](https://twitter.com/macaesbruno/status/1511663767381286912?s=21&amp;t=tno74nCbQFJ4fGTNv0gh1w) in which he stipulates what would be economic impact on Germany would it stop all gas imports now. 
3. Look at graphs at [ITF Kiel for the world economy](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/). In absolute numbers Germany is the 4th biggest contributor of aid to Ukraine (after, US, Poland and UK). In comparison to size of aid to its GDP however, it is at THE VERY LAST place of all the countries, giving roughly 20 TIMES less than Estonia and 8 TIMES less than Poland.",5877f3df9c31f1af02f246b1599082b292d9c8bd,True,False,,,,,0,1650589012,,0,{},i5ovn7k,False,t3_u8jajv,False,True,t1_i5lnmr5,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u8jajv/why_is_germany_behaving_this_way_towards_ukraine/i5ovn7k/,1650589023,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650560212.0
