What implication ? Russia wasn't a paria state yet. Why didn't the rest of Europe and the Us sanction Russia to the ground back then ? You're asking of France to have applied sanction in the past that no one else did. 

&gt;You wouldn't apply contracts with Germany in 1939 so the logic is clearly there for breaking contract.

Russia wasn't an enemy of NATO back then.  Germany was an enemy of France. 

You can't just break a contract like that. Especially when you were already paid. 


You're putting unrealistic standard over France while not expecting the same from any other NATO or EU country.

Of course it wasn't a coup.  Coups by definition result in someone seizing power from the government, which didn't happen here.  

Yanukovych *himself* signed the agreements to form an interim unity government, to institute constitutional reforms, to reduce the president's powers, and early elections.  The signing was witnessed by Foreign Ministers of Poland, Germany and France...  but wouldn't you know it, the Russian representative would not sign the agreement, they didn't want to lose their puppet.  The United States even supported a stipulation that Yanukovych remain president during the interim unity government period, but the people of Ukraine would not have it, so he fled the country *the next day*, back to his master in Russia.

A discussion by a single US official about who he would like to have in power is irrelevant when the people chose Porochenko at the polls, and again, the official position of the United States was to keep Yanukovych in power for a time.  Further, the individuals discussed were not either placed in positions of power, nor were they elected.  Further still, the phone call you refer to occurred on the 4th of February, 2014...  but the protests had been going on without any US involvement since the 21st of November, 2013.

&gt; At the start of the conflict, France's left-leaning president, Francois Mitterrand, had come to Britain's aid by declaring an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina. He also allowed the Falklands-bound British fleet to use French port facilities in West Africa, as well as providing London with detailed information about planes and weaponry his country had sold to Buenos Aires. Paris also co-operated with extensive British efforts to stop Argentina acquiring any more Exocets on the world's arms market.

Don't get me wrong, i'm not against it, but this should be done properly, not haphazardly. 

Stating that Republicans, or any political party, is against US interest is a blanket statement without proper truths. Usually it has to do with *specifics* in the bill that a party is against. Both sides do this all the time. Just because a bill 'looks' good, you have to read the fine print of the whole thing. Many times there are items added to a bill that the other party is like no way.

Social democrats, man.

It seems possible he's in Putin's pocket for one reason or another and desperately trying to avoid doing anything he's not allowed to do.

I've also heard that Germany is still very dependent on Russian gas. The Nordstream 2 pipeline was *halted*, not canceled, and definitely not torn up-  it's quite likely they were planning on waiting until this whole war thing blew over in a month or two, Russia was victorious, and they can surreptitiously start it back up again. 

Further, Russian gas is used in *industrial uses* in Germany, not just power generation. That's hard to replace because a wind turbine isn't going to get you the benzene you need for your manufacturing process, even if it can replace a gas power plant by generating power.

It is the same with the Swedish scopes that Russia is using. They are not considerate as military but as hunting equipment. Sweden sells them on the open market to big wholesales companies of hunting equipment and then FSB buys them from the company via one of their ""shadow"" companies. There is nothing Sweden can do about it unless all nations starts classifies them as military equipment

It have also been the same with the engines from Germany that Russian have been using for their drones.

They actually looked once at using criminals as elite special forces type soldiers like Dirty Dozen/Suicide Squad. The theory was they are cold ruthless killers not afraid to get dirty but what they found was is criminals are just very selfish people who care about their own well-being to a narcissist level. They are cowards because they don’t want to die, they want to get rich and live a life of luxury. In his interview with Oliver Stone when discussing the purpose of life Putin didn’t say love, family, honour or country. He said something about life’s short so it’s all about living it the fullest. That’s why he and lots of other selfish criminals in Russia have stolen billions of dollars from the country. So ask yourself is Putin prepared to die for his country? Of course not, he cares so little about his country that he sent badly prepared and equipped conscripts to fight a war he thought would be a walk in the park, he could then put his Ukrainian oligarch friend in charge and continue to get even more money. It’s all gone wrong for him and he’s desperately looking for a way out so he can get back to being a selfish greedy criminal. One thing he will never do is risk his own life and the lives of his many kids, wives, mistresses because that is all he cares about. He’s not president because he loves his country, he’s the top Mafia boss of his country and by being president he can’t be locked up and can steal even more money. If there’s no one on this sub prepared to start a nuclear war despite most of us being broke and clinically depressed there is no one someone with everything he has going for him will do it. Helping Ukraine win by any means necessary will just make Putin stop bullying them because bully’s and criminals prefer easy soft targets. He’ll likely take Mariupol and then secure the land bridge to Crimea and do a Bush and call it mission accomplished.

This is a SHORT list of people who have suffered mysterious deaths, attempted murders, or imprisonment. If you look into these people even the slightest bit, you will see that most of them were killed in suspicious manners. Many were journalists, politicians, businessmen, diplomats, ambassadors, or simply just held different view points. They were deemed threats and they were removed from the world in one way or another. This does not include the regular everyday people who have spoke out, or the people who are simply just in jail on bogus charges.  


This shows a disconnect between what people over here think its like for Russians who do not support this war, and what it is actually like. Putin and his minions are too strong there for some grassroots movement man. The worst part is that the list I just posted only dates until 2020. It does not even include anything that has happened just since this conflict. Also, many of these people were OUT of Russia when they met their demise. There is a systematic way of dealing with opposition, and its effective because it is so brutal, that it scares the next one into taking a safer path. At the very least it outlines the evident danger. 

I am saying we have no place to judge them for not overthrowing Putin by now, it is not like they havent tried man. This is evil on a scale not commonly encountered, and it isnt fair to act like we know what it is like to live with it.
