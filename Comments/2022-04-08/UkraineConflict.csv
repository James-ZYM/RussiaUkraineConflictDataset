That is only correct because they won't let East regions be sovereign in a democratic way. It doesn't matter what you think about the separatists that were there during the decision, if they weren't there the referendum wouldn't be allowed to happen and that also wouldn't be democratic, would it?

I think to have a right of bombing civilians just because they are or you want them to be your citizens is insane and that rethoric should be challenged waaay before Russians decided to stop it by themselves.

""all the killing will end if you just let us eliminate your nation and everyone in our way as quick as possible"" 

Again this is only correct if you think everyone in Ukraine is fascist. This is how supposedly Russia thinks if we ask the west, but in this case Ukraine would count civilian casualties in hundred thousands instead of in hundreds.

Honestly theres probably elements of anarchism and heritage that essentially were very appealing to various non political cultural phenomenon that crossed paths in various communities throughout history. 

Take say for example the cross over of new age mysticism in communes which were philosophically or at least interpreted as aligned with anarchist ideas.

Because so much of the pseudo mysticism is based off narcissistic mythical individualism, I think that goes hand in hand with certain areas of ""anarchist culture"" essentially turning into a vague set of highly ambiguous, yet apparently communally aligned, personal principles.

Alot of these people are more likely libertarians but dont even realise it because they don't even understand what anarchism is.

There's even a new video of Ukraine troops ambushing a T-72 column with a 30mm autocannon from an armored unit (almost certainly an APC) if its really recent and from the city - it means Ukraine still has armored units functioning in the city - which is a really good sign.   
The loss of downtown Mariupol is not good news but its not too bad either. In urban combat when faced with a superior force (in this case Russia has more men, armor and supplies in the Mariupol area), you use your fortifications to inflict casualties until Russia can bring their artillery and tanks to bear on your location - but before that happens you disappear to another building. Fortify, ambush, relocate, repeat. Russia in turn, will keep moving troops forward in the city in an effort to minimize the locations Ukraine troops can re-position to.   
When a unit begins to run out of room to reposition it either finds a weakness in the surrounding troops and attacks there to breakout into a less secured section of the city or it finds a highly defensible position and digs in and fights as long as it can.  
It does appear at least two large groups of Ukrainian troops have dug into their possibly final positions.   
The Azovstal steel works (pic 2) in the SE of the city - honestly a great position - protected by open water to the south and the Kalmius river to the west and north. The factory itself is incredibly hardened by the nature of it design as a steel works. It should do a good job protecting the troops inside from artillery - and its a massive complex with multiple levels - its going to require Russia to assault it with infantry or cut it off and try to starve them out. If you study the siege of Stalingrad from World War II - Russian troops dug into the tractor factory and grain towner and held the German forces off for weeks - German infantry had to clear each office and work area inch by inch. I've worked the offices of an old school steel plant (not the new mini-mill ones) and they are just thick hunks of metal and concrete.  
SW of the city another large Ukraine unit appears to have settled into the port (Pic 3), while not as defensible as the the steel works, it would be loaded with supplies particularly food which means it removes supply issues or it could be securing supplies for other units in the city. And the warehouses and storage facilities do offer very good concealment.  
Most analysts are not expecting Mairupol to hold out for more than a few days at this point - but I'm less sure.",f53858a9908f8b77cdb753343ec0fa40faa11a63,True,False,,,,,0,1649396739,,0,{},i3v5ujn,True,t3_tywka9,False,True,t3_tywka9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tywka9/mariupol_steel_works_and_port_likely_final/i3v5ujn/,1649396756,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649367939.0,

For instance two opposing Christian sub types, presumably prayed to the same God, and went out and killed eachother. Shia and Sunni, same thing. We can look to which sides won and say God was with them and not the other side, but generally have committed the same acts. I won't ignore the fact that sometimes the defending side had no choice, and chose to defend themselves. Who can blame them, but usually somewhere along the way, they lose their way too.

It illustrates that man is hardly qualified to rule other men, and we should hope that there is a powerful entity coming to save us and establish sovereignty in a way that is just and fair because if not, it's not looking like these problems are within man's grasp to fix.

Not because we aren't capable or smart enough. It's because we are essentially still just a bunch of warring tribes. A house divided cannot stand, so by default it's out of our hands.

Imagine if all the money and effort worldwide spent on war was spent on truly solving our problems, breezing past the red tape and avoiding the sticky fingers of corruption to achieve great things.

The treaties that established NATO are legally binding. They establish very clearly that the only way for NATO to act the way you describe is in the event of an attack on a member state.

Attacks on non member states have zero bearing. 

The individual countries in NATO could decide to attack if they wanted but doing that eliminates them from the alliance and no other NATO nations are required to support them. 

All this talk about NATO.should punish Russia is pointless. NATO is not the UN. It is up to the UN to act. And the UN can't because Russia has veto power on the Security Council. 

There is no other multinational alliance out there that is even remotely involved in this conflict. So it is strictly between Russia and Ukraine.

You have to question when many look to have nothing but clean clothing still wearing body armour and all of a sudden there is a fully kitted out soldier who looks SF.

Anyway, I said that those kids are guilty of the murders, rapes and what have you that they did, nowhere did I excuse them. What I did say is that this is bound to happen as soon as discipline breaks down, remember Abu Ghraib and many other examples from all over the world.

Even though I do agree that many (if not all) will be clear about the objective after a few weeks, I don't think just deserting is that easy. If you get caught, you get shot. If the other side sees you and don't let you talk, they may shoot you  and in the mean time you have to eat, which in a situation like that is almost certainly looting and stealing. Many do surrender given the chance, they don't always do. That is not to say that they aren't guilty if they do something wrong, just not black and white.

The civilians, yes, they support a war and some even the genocide. I am not convinced that they know what they exactly support though. They may think they are right in doing so because the other side is pure evil.

Yes, there is nuance, but there's no nuance regarding soldiers who torture, murder and rape. In fact, after a couple of weeks into the war, there's no nuance regarding soldiers in general. By that time they already knew why they where there for. They already knew they were there to genocide Ukrainians. They could have deserted/surrendered.

As for civilians, most of them fully support not just Putin, not just the war, but the genocide. Because they truly believe they are the master race. Full on nazi shit.

A more general comment on all the folks bashing opposition politics. Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of Ukraine even if they differ on details. Only 13% of Americans disapprove of sanctions on Russia. Considering 15% believe in QAnon, 4% are illiterate, and over half of Americans have less than a 6th grade level reading ability, I find this fantastic levels of support. Definitely way more than enough to motivate politicians.

*****
&gt; The vote to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council comes several weeks after the country invaded Ukraine and just days after reports of a massacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, Ukraine.

&gt; The resolution to vote Russia out of the premier human rights body was initiated by the United States following the Bucha killings.

&gt; The resolution focused on &amp;quot;Grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.""

That‚Äôs because the explosion can be from the payload or the target. Large supplies of fuel or ammo can create huge explosions, without in depth image analysis (like high speed film) you can‚Äôt really tell what is causing what. 
Thermobaric weapons produce large fireballs because they use atmospheric oxygen as the oxides for the fuel. High explosives carry their own oxidizers. The reason this is advantageous is that you can carry more fuel in a given payload because the space isn‚Äôt taken up by oxidizers. The trade off is that the velocity of the shockwave is reduced and the duration of it is increased. This is also the reason that they are considered inhumane. The blast wave is lower intensity so a person might survive it and be conscious while the fuel burns them to death. The weapons are more effective in enclosed  spaces due to the longer push the blast wave exerts. This characteristic tends to lift and push structure apart causing them to collapse as opposed to high velocity charges that tend to cut or shatter materials. Either way is a terrible way to die.",003f9db00775128060f792cb92885a8079ba77da,True,False,,,,,0,1649351694,,0,{},i3sadgt,False,t3_t4eeqj,False,True,t3_t4eeqj,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4eeqj/what_kind_of_weapon_is_this_sent_from_kharkov_a/i3sadgt/,1649351713,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649322894.0,True

Facts Matter!

President Donald Trump: first impeachment (2020)

In February 2020, President Donald Trump was impeached on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This stemmed from a phone call he had with the recently elected President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in July of 2019, in which Trump made a request for the president to investigate the energy company, Burisma, which Joe Biden‚Äôs son worked for. In exchange for this, the US leader would agree to a highly prized face-to-face meeting between the two presidents.",f49662df0cba4d3921c1e7a352e61ff731565015,True,False,,,,,0,1649348340,,0,{},i3s1s6f,False,t3_ty8zzn,False,True,t1_i3rzyim,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ty8zzn/neighbours_war_somewhere_in_the_usa/i3s1s6f/,1649348354,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649319540.0,

**Russians‚Äô statements about Trump**

- ‚ÄúDonald‚Äôs right, and I agree with him,‚Äù [regarding US troop withdrawal from Syria] said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose influence over Syria can only grow more dominant as the United States exits.
- ‚ÄúTrump is God‚Äôs gift that keeps on giving,‚Äù said Vladimir Frolov, a Russian columnist and foreign affairs analyst. ‚ÄúTrump implements Russia‚Äôs negative agenda by default, undermining the U.S.‚Äìled world order, U.S. alliances, U.S. credibility as a partner and an ally. All of this on his own. Russia can just relax and watch and root for Trump, which Putin does at every TV appearance.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWe can tolerate some degree of unpredictability and mercurial policies on the tactical level ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth it,‚Äù Mr. Frolov, the Russian foreign affairs analyst, wrote in response to written questions. ‚ÄúIn Trump we trust ‚Ä¶ to do the right thing.‚Äù
- Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Upper House of the Russian Parliament, has said that ‚Äúthe departure of James Mattis is a positive signal for Russia, since Mattis was far more hawkish on Russia and China than Donald Trump.‚Äù Kosachev opined that Trump apparently considered his own agenda in dealing with Russia, China and America‚Äôs allies to be ""more important than keeping James Mattis at his post,"" concluding: ""That‚Äôs an interesting signal, and a more positive one‚Äù for Russia.
- Semyon Bagdasarov, director of the Moscow-based Center for Middle Eastern and Central Asian Studies, appearing on the Russian state TV show ‚ÄúThe Evening with Vladimir Soloviev,‚Äù described the ultimate outcome of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria as ‚Äúa total dream come true.‚Äù The host, Vladimir Soloviev, chimed in and predicted a massive picnic‚Äî‚ÄúIt will be a real celebration, in the best traditions!‚Äù
- State TV host Olga Skabeeva surmised that Americans are ‚Äúlosers, since Putin has defeated them in every way.‚Äù With a theatrical sigh, her co-host, Evgeny Popov, added: ‚ÄúTrump is ours again‚Äîwhat are you going to do?‚Äù Every member of the sizeable audience enthusiastically clapped. Russian opinion makers recount the Kremlin‚Äôs victories with unmistakable glee. Popov smirked: ‚ÄúIt seems to Americans that we won on every front: the U.S. Secretary of Defense has been removed, we unquestionably secured a complete, unconditional victory in Syria. ‚Ä¶On top of that, Rusal sanctions have been lifted with Trump‚Äôs hands.‚Äù Panelists of the show, including Russian lawmakers, couldn‚Äôt hide their satisfied grins.
- Discussing the planned departure of the U.S. from Syria, state TV host Olga Skabeeva pondered why Trump suddenly decided to leave at this point in time: ‚ÄúAmericans say, it‚Äôs because he is beholden to Putin. Is that logical? Yes, it is.‚Äù

Regarding the most recent Syria pullout:

- ‚ÄúPutin won the lottery! Russia‚Äôs unexpected triumph in the Middle East,‚Äù raved Mikhail Rostovsky in his article for the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. ‚ÄúThose who were convinced of Trump‚Äôs uselessness for Russia ought to think again...What Washington got out of this strange move is completely unclear. To the contrary, what Moscow gained from this is self-evident...Trump‚Äôs mistake in Syria is the unexpected ‚Äòlottery win‚Äô that further strengthened Moscow‚Äôs position in the Middle East and undermined America‚Äôs prestige as a rational political player and a reliable partner.‚Äù  
- Maksim Yusin, the editor of international politics at the leading Russian business daily Kommersant, was amazed by the ongoing stream of inexplicable actions by the American president that benefit the Kremlin. ‚ÄúAll of this benefits the Russian Federation,‚Äù Yusin marveled. ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve been watching Trump‚Äôs behavior lately and get seditious thoughts: maybe he really is a Russian agent? He is laboring so hard to strengthen the international image of Russia in general‚Äîand Putin in particular...In this situation, Americans‚Äîto their chagrin and our enjoyment‚Äîare the only losers in this situation.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis is such a pleasure,‚Äù grinned Olga Skabeeva, the host of Russia‚Äôs state television program 60 Minutes. ‚ÄúRussian soldiers have taken an American base under our complete control, without a fight!‚Äù Skabeeva‚Äôs co-host Evgeny Popov added: ‚ÄúSuddenly, we have defeated everyone.‚Äù Incredulously, Skabeeva pointed out: ‚ÄúThis is an American base‚Äîand they just ran away! Trump ran away!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time since America has been humiliated this way,‚Äù gloated political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak, ‚ÄúThey ran away in shame! I can‚Äôt recall such a scenario since Vietnam.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúFor us, this is of great interest, because this is a key region where energy prices are being determined. That is a shining cherry on top.‚Äù Political scientist Andrey Nikulin concurred: ‚ÄúThis is sad for America. A smaller-scale version of what happened in Vietnam.‚Äù
- Appearing on the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev, political analyst Evgeny Satanovsky recounted many ways in which Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from Syria and abandon the Kurds has hurt the image and standing of the United States: ‚ÄúAmerica betrayed everyone...Trump also strengthened the anti-American mood in Turkey, when he promised to destroy the Turkish economy.‚Äù Satanovsky opined that now any economic problems or currency fluctuations in Turkey can be blamed directly on the United States, prompting textile, tobacco, steel and other industries to turn away from America. ‚ÄúAnti-Americanism in Turkey is off the charts,‚Äù Satanovsky pointed out, ‚ÄúAmerican politics are tangled in their own shoelaces... America is successfully self-eliminating from the region.‚Äù
- Discussing the exchanges between President Trump and President Erdoƒüan, Leonid Kalashnikov, Chairman of Russian State Duma Committee for the Commonwealth of Independent States affairs, commented: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care that those two clowns write such letters to each other. You can only pity them. Is it better for us that the Americans left Syria? Of course it is! Will we make deals with Erdoƒüan? Of course we will.‚Äù
- Vice President Mike Pence gave Erdoƒüan everything the Turkish side has been attempting to achieve, in exchange for a promised five-day pause in the offensive. A Turkish official told Middle East Eye, ‚ÄúWe got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting.‚Äù At the conclusion of the five-day pause, Erdoƒüan will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.
- Appearing on 60 Minutes, Franz Klintsevich, a member of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, declared that Russia will take full advantage of America‚Äôs withdrawal from the Middle East, becoming a top player in the region. Klintsevich argued that America‚Äôs withdrawal from Syria represented Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúglobal victory‚Äù and ‚Äúdemonstrated the absolute superiority of Russia‚Äôs arms, diplomacy and foreign policy.‚Äù
- During the same show, political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak was overcome with gratitude: ‚ÄúI look at Trump and think: ‚ÄòMay God grant him good health‚Äîand another term. This is a great situation for Russia...We can practically sit back and reap the dividends from what others are doing...Meanwhile, Trump is yet to make a single good deal, which is why I wish him good health, may he flourish and get re-elected...Trump is a great candidate. I applaud him...For America, this isn‚Äôt a very good president.‚Äù
- The Kremlin‚Äôs propagandists see no acceptable alternative to Trump amongst any viable presidential candidates in the United States. Complaining about prevailing anti-Russian attitudes, Vladimir Soloviev‚Äîhost of the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev‚Äîsarcastically surmised: ‚ÄúSo it looks like we‚Äôll have to elect your president‚Äîagain.‚Äù

*What are the chances that it‚Äôs a coincidence that all of these things help Russia and hurt the US? Occam‚Äôs Razor suggests that Trump‚Äôs intention is to help Russia.*

Trump ties to Putin:


An overview of Trump‚Äôs numerous ties to Russia

Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/)

‚ñ∫ Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use[ Trump real estate to launder money.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html) In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

‚ñ∫ In 1984, David Bogatin ‚Äî a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss ‚Äî met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html), Apr 30, 1992)

‚ñ∫ [Felix Sater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater ) is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. [He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-felix-sater-trump-associate-at-center-of-the-mueller-russia-probe-2018-11 ) He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

‚ñ∫ Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and [Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2016/10/03/donald-trump-and-the-felon-inside-his-business-dealings-with-a-mob-connected-hustler/#873b09222824 ) Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

‚ñ∫ In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, [Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev,](https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190217/trump-in-palm-beach-did-russian-mansion-buyer-make-money ) a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.

‚ñ∫ Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. [Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/trumps-top-targets-in-the-russia-probe-are-experts-in-organized-crime/569056/) That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.

‚ñ∫ From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

‚ñ∫  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

‚ñ∫ According to a [Bloomberg investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs ) (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  ‚Äúa third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.‚Äù

‚ñ∫ In 2013, Federal agents busted an ‚Äúultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring‚Äù run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. [A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a ‚Äúsophisticated money-laundering scheme‚Äù connected to Semion Mogilevich.](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

‚ñ∫ The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. [Russia is a mafia state.](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/05/19/inside-vladimir-putins-mafia-state ) That is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

‚ñ∫  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the [FBI described Kislin as having ties to the Russian mob.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/ ) Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

‚ñ∫ A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. [The NRA](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/27/764879242/nra-was-foreign-asset-to-russia-ahead-of-2016-new-senate-report-reveals ) got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell [got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/mcconnells-biggest-donor-isnt-russian/ ) In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Craig Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.

‚ñ∫ At the Cityscape USA‚Äôs Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Donald Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, [saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2)

‚ñ∫ Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt rely on American banks.
