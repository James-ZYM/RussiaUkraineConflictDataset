1. F-35's and Reapers are FIXED WING aviation. The first person to mention helicopters was yourself, half way down the thread, clutching at straws. You brought up helicopters. To be clear, helicopters while able to contribute to an air campaign are primarily operated as rapid maneuver elements of the a ground war and should be considered as such. A typical SEAD/DEAD package today would be a combination of EA-18, F-35, and F-16C/J,  with support from the wide variety of resources available (Rivet Joint, Global Hawk, Reapers etc.). All of these are fixed wing! 

2. Lets get another thing clear, helicopters are vulnerable to MANPADS, especially if your operating them like the russians are. Now if we talk about SHORAD, the range of the guided ATGM's used by helicopters is entirely governed by how far away the helicopter needs to be to safeyl snipe the SHORAD's before attacking the forces its guarding. I.e. stand off engagement with precision weapons, which is the thrust of my original comment.

3. Since when are we talking about CAS. You yourself said this was a conversation about SEAD. It's clear you don't understand US doctrine in the slightest. Hell you don't even understand the full set of mission sets that would be undertaken, and what would be the most prevalent mission. Air Interdiction would be the main mission for any US air force in ukraine, enabled by SEAD/DCA/OCA missions. CAS would be a common mission, but the best bombs dropped are those that stop the enemy from even rocking up to fight in the first place, which is the point of the interdiction mission.

4. The advent of precision weapons, and targeting pods, means CAS can be completed from medium and high altitude, since you have both better vision with the targeting pods (zoom, day night, thermal) and more time to build battlefield awareness and/or be talked on to target since you can start the process 50NM away. Then once the target is confirmed, laying a precision weapon (most likely GPS guided, not lasered) on a close in target is much safer for forces on the ground, then the pilot doing it with dumb bombs, cannons and mark 1 eyeball. The only reason people have visions of low-level CAS still being relevant is the prevalence of ""show of force"" missions in afghanistan, and the until recent lack of modern targeting equipment the A-10C Dinosaur.",c42d7c14c5996cc69265107da686d9f1a18866f6,True,False,,,,,0,1649461396,,0,{},i3ywtx9,False,t3_tyoapc,False,True,t1_i3w0apq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyoapc/getting_serious_about_sead_european_air_forces/i3ywtx9/,1649461409,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649432596.0

https://youtu.be/FBbQijuCGF8

It would be useful to remind that she is the daughter of the first democratically elected mayor of Saint Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak (who was sharing his duty with Putin at the time) and the Russian senator Lyudmila Narusova (she’s the godmother of one of Putin’s children). However Ksenia, their daughter, was the challenger in this election. She clearly apperef as the opponent of Putin’s regime during that campaign.

Her speech became very popular, as many valuable and dangerously true points were mentioned in her speech : 

Ksenia spoke directly about why the current Russian regime needs to justify their internal economic problems with an extrinsic enemy to keep the corruption going.  

“We need to return to the old path, move towards the same goal. Not to resist, but to join NATO ourselves, to become part of the global security system,” Sobchak believes. “The most immoral thing, perhaps, is hidden under the phrase “geopolitical interests.”  above the interests of ordinary citizens.

 In her opinion, «I think that the most immoral thing is when in our country everything is hidden under the word ""geopolitics"". You know, as soon as impoverished Russians are told about the word ""geopolitical interests"", it immediately means blood, manipulation and tragedies. Because nothings means more then the interest of our citizens and they are endlessly sacrificed …All this is done to deceive you to explain why you get more miserable with smaller salaries, less capacity to buy what you need, pensions are indexed to ridiculous amounts! And life over the past 5 years has become harder and worse, despite the promised stability. And I hope that one day with my help of without it, our people will understand that the agression around our country is fabricated. That instead of standing on our borders with an AK and waiting for the US aggressor, we should join the alliance. Dear friends all of this is just done to fool you, to justify your low salaries, miserable pensions and why the minimum wage is ridiculous. This is what all the « geopolitics » talk in our country is really about »

""We need to open our eyes and join the EU, join NATO. We have a new generation that doesn’t want to make war with NATO. Our people want to study and travel all over the world. Today we want a world without borders. Why we keep on playing the role of everyone’s enemy ? We are not expected in Europe, we are not given visas, because we are an aggressor country! Why do you want us to be a country that will dig in and shoot back from everyone? You say for NATO that they are dangerous, but they never didn't try to attack us ? This is just not true, this is absurd.""  Sobchak says.  
""Do you want them to try?""  - provoked the leader.  

""Yes, why do you think that this should happen? We ourselves are currently the aggressors in the world! We are seizing foreign territories in violation of international treaties! We are waging wars in foreign countries!""  Xenia continues.  

""Well, what to do with Crimea if Ksenia Sobchak becomes president?""  - the presenter decided to quip.  

""“What does it mean to do something with Crimea?” the candidate for the Russian presidency was indignant. “These are 2 million 300 thousand people! These are living people. They cannot be put anywhere!”

 “They voted to become part of Russia,” Olga Skabeeva clarified.

 “It can not be called a referendum,” Ksenia Sobchak believes. “A real vote cannot be with one question and conducted surrounded by men in military gear. It’s like asking the question « Do you drink brandy in the morning? » This is not a question for a referendum. 
An international real referendum should be held with independent international observers in Crimea. And Crimeans should decide for themselves who they should be. There should be Not one, but three questions asked : « Do you want to become part of Russia? Do you want to become part of Ukraine? Or, do you want to be an independent territory » Àd there we can expect big surprises. There are a huge number of indigen people there, the Crimean Tatars for exemple, who may want to see Crimea independent, but that is not for us to decide."" Sobchak answered.  

Then the presenter Popov decided to change the subject and ask a question about the destruction of the statues of the heroes of the Great war in Poland and asked Xenia how Russia should react to this.  

""Listen, really, it seems to me that the last thing we should now react to is what Poland is doing in its sovereign country! Do you really think that we have no other problems?! Let's look at what is happening in our country, the fact that there are killings and dead bodies on the main square of our capital (implying assassination of Nemtsov) but you discuss the statue of Stalin who conducted repressions and wrote « killing lists » for hundred of people. This is what you miss about the past great of Russie ? Today there are a lot of bigger problems!  Sobchak answered.  

In the end, Sobchak surprised everyone by declaring aloud what many think about all the time: ""Well, you understand, but only one candidate always wins in our"" kind of ""elections"" - Putin.",854ca6d4102fcb465ae0a8dea39b83f9dd4ec760,True,False,,,,,0,1649455862,,0,{},i3yk4xa,False,t3_tyfct0,False,True,t1_i3se6l1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyfct0/bill_clinton_why_i_expanded_nato/i3yk4xa/,1649455876,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649427062.0

About CSIS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies

&gt; The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is a think tank based in Washington, D.C., in the United States.[5] CSIS was founded as the Center for Strategic and International Studies of Georgetown University in 1962. The center conducts policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on issues concerning international relations, trade, technology, finance, energy and geostrategy.[6]

----------------

Quote from the article:

&gt; At face value, sharing capital and technology with CSSC subsidiaries may seem innocuous, but it should raise red flags for nations concerned about China’s growing military power. Facilitating better resource-sharing between military and civilian ventures is a critical element of China’s MCF strategy, and many of China's shipbuilding facilities are being used for both commercial and military operations. Foreign capital can also aid in offsetting the research and development costs of military assets. Workers trained to construct commercial vessels may even be able to transfer some of their skills when working on PLAN warships. 

&gt; Access to foreign commercial technology and know-how may inadvertently help China innovate in the military realm.

Unless there's some other non-NATO European country with a massive conventional force on their border, an even more massive nuclear arsenal, an authoritarian government, an expansionist, imperialistic foreign policy and ideological and cultural underpinnings that are fundamentally opposed to the European goals of stable borders and collective security that I seem to have forgotten about. 

Short-term setbacks and short-term promises did not change that. Foreign policy impact is measured in decades and Russia posed a medium-term and long-term threat to Europe regardless of their inability to do near-term damage in the mid 1990s. Pretending that Russia could be ignored or appeased because their economy was busted in 1994 would have been a disastrous decision by NATO.

&gt;Hey look, another way walkback where you admit that we did not treat the Czech Republic et al. as enemies after 1991.

Because the Czechs and others rapidly reformed in the early 1990s. Russia didn't. What part of that are you not getting?

Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other former Warsaw Pact nations who acted more similarly to Russia than they did the Czech Republic/Poland/Hungary also got the cold shoulder from the West.

Russia never stopped being an existential threat to the sovereignty of its neighbors (which is by far the main reason so many of them were desperate to join NATO) and to the security of other European countries. The fact that their economy was busted and the military was a disorganized mess for a few years did not change that one iota, it just mean there was a temporary reprieve.

And they all got a mulligan after 1991. When Yeltsin raised the question in 1991 of Russia joining NATO as a long-term goal (not immediate), the response from NATO was lol no. Or in your case, it would have been fuck no.  
  
When the Czech Republic et al. sought to join NATO, did we give them the same lol no response? No. We gave them a far more enthusiastic response: for example, Clinton told Havel that NATO Partnership for Peace was the first step towards eventual NATO membership (whereas Clinton had Warren Christopher tell Kozyrev and Yeltsin that PfP had nothing to do with membership...)

You can't possibly be pretending that the ""reforms"" Russia made that you're touting so highly (""they only SLIGHTLY cheated in two consecutive elections! And didn't even invade anybody, because they couldn't afford to!"") were anywhere approaching the complete transformations that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic underwent in the 1990s (and others made on longer timelines) to overhaul their political and civil liberties and fundamentally change their entire approach to geopolitics.

NATO took those countries' interest in NATO seriously because those countries took NATO membership seriously -- it was their primary foreign policy goal for them that decade and they put in serious work to make it happen.

Russia's primary foreign policy goal was not joining NATO, or even ensuring a peaceful and secure Europe via collective security. It was, and still is, continued dominion over their sphere of influence, to the maximum degree that they are able to. They did not take NATO membership seriously with their own foreign or domestic policies, and so NATO did not treat their mentions of it seriously. Nor should they have.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Regardless of contact the Marines and Army assault troops involved in clearing Fallujah during the second battle were entering and clearing every structure they passed as they advanced. The operational goal was to eliminate the insurgency in Fallujah by first establishing a tight cordon to search everyone evacuating, looking for intelligence driven targets or those carrying military arms, while assault troops advanced block by block, house by house, room by room to either kill the enemy defending, push them out to try to get out the cordon unarmed, and to find caches and other insurgent weapons, supplies, command and control equipment, intel, etc.

Enemy wise, many of the Islamist insurgents were using suicidal tactics similar to the IJA in WW2, allowing their escape routes to be lost just to fight at close quarters hoping to kill maximum numbers inside the buildings. Sometimes the insurgents would fire at US troops while they were still on the street, other times they waited for them to enter a specific building to ambush them inside. The enemy tactics favoring the former were similar to a traditional urban defense, but those favoring the latter caused a lot US casualties and was the biggest concern since the US assault troops had to enter every building and room, how do they know which is clear and which is an ambush until they enter? That led to a shift in clearing tactics that were focused on the threat being inside buildings, not on the streets, so clearing teams used a less dynamic means of entering and clearing buildings because they couldn't afford to flood them dynamically and then get ambushed in the living room by a MG bunker or the like. They advanced slowly inside and cleared until they met resistance, at which point they moved out and destroyed the building from the outside and then cleared the rubble. Not even considering that the overall advance was only as fast as one platoon could clear both sides of a road they were responsible for as they moved south, they also were delayed further by needing to have a more cautious entry.

It appears the Russians in Mariupol are performing a more traditional urban battle because the Ukrainians arent Salafi jihadis hoping to die by ambushing Russians inside rooms, which wouldn't work anyways since it doesn't appear the Russians are clearing every room or even entering every building. Why should they? If the Russians move down a block and nobody shoots at them while they're on the street, nobody is defending it unless it's all one big ambush. So they are staying on the street advancing till they run into contact on the street, then they halt, fire at it, call for armor to fire at it, maybe call for arty to fire at it, and then either blow up the hard point, potentially assault it. Entering buildings and clearing houses is secondary, only as needed to deal with hard points, gain high ground temporarily, establish remain overnight sites, casualty collection points, field HQs, etc. Basically Brest, Berlin, Hue, etc, where most of the fighting is in the streets.

To put their size in perspective, Mariupol is about 10x bigger than Fallujah. If the Marine led forces tried clearing a city that size the same way it would have taken many months longer. Just for reference, Mosul, which was cleared similarly to Fallujah, is roughly the same size as Mariupol (though had a much larger prebattle population). That's one reason it took so long to clear. 

By not having to enter and clear every single room, the Russian clearing op won't be as thorough in finding and eliminating every enemy but it's faster. Resistance is equally heavy, but it doesn't appear the Ukrainians are focusing on martyrdom tactics like those done heavily in Fallujah and more heavily in Mosul.

Then again, who the fuck knows what's actually happening?

[],False,,TheFlawlessCassandra,,,[],,,,text,t2_9bch6dlg,False,False,"&gt;And they did try; you are 100% wrong about that.

Nope. From the start Russia refused to implement the sorts of reforms to institutions that democracy needed to survive, let alone thrive. They didn't put significant constitutional limits on the power of the President (your own citation of the OSCE report brings this up). They didn't stop strangling press freedom, including the assassination of journalists. Yeltsin deliberately created the oligarchy during the market economy transition in order to consolidate his own power. 

Any flirtations with democracy or Western alignment were doomed from the start. It would have been the height of foolishness for NATO to watch them go from shelling Parliament to shelling Grozny and go ""hey, maybe that ex-KGB officer that's in charge now, who just backed out on plans to mutually step down militarization of the border, is serious about being one of the good guys"" and let up even for a moment on their vigilance against the threat of renewed Russian aggression. A threat that has clearly proven to be serious and valid multiple times since then. 

&gt;That's not a fact.  


So do you disagree with the assertion that the short-term and largely superficial gains Russia had made in the early 1990s had already begun to seriously erode by the late 90s and early 2000s with no sign of turning around, or are you just being pedantic?

&gt;You don't know that. Because we never tried.

Russia never created the opportunity for us to. That's on them, not on NATO. And honestly, whether you want to argue that they earnestly tried and utterly failed or just didn't try at all is essentially semantics -- either way that's not NATO's fault, and no action by NATO could have forced Russia into making the sort of reforms that were necessary (if they had attempted to it probably would have made things worse if anything). 

Russia was never remotely in a position to be seriously considered for even serious discussions on membership, not the least of which because they remained (and remain) the *single greatest threat to the security of NATO members.* Until that changed, and it never did, any mention of Russian membership deserved to be immediately dismissed, much as someone suggesting a farmer should allow a fox into a henhouse so it could help protect them would have been told to fuck right the hell off.",a8e7dd2680eca39a2e16bd445215b435720ffc51,True,False,,,,,0,1649442313,,0,{},i3xm7h8,False,t3_tyfct0,False,True,t1_i3w6nbx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyfct0/bill_clinton_why_i_expanded_nato/i3xm7h8/,1649442331,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649413513.0

They launched a major attack on Mariupol for one reason: it was achievable. 

Every other city resisting was bypassed and either encircled and left alone because it was too big or Russians too poorly supported to attack. But Mariupol was easily encircled from the north by simply bypassing one road. Plus, it's not that big of a city. Likely estimate of defenders was underestimated, and operational commanders are just salivating at taking Ukraine's biggest port on the sea of Azov. After that it was just a matter of ordering an assault from west, north, and east. Like Kyiv and Ukraine as a whole, Mariupol should have fell in days. 

Why didn't they surrender? From the perspective of the Russians, sensible thing wasn't to resist, especially after the Russians cranked up fires and started blowing the shit out of everything with arty and airstrikes. But still resisting tough as nails. It was likely at that point the Russians at the OSK HQ level realized they bit off more than they can chew. Their doctrine discourages urban warfare for just this reason, it chews up large numbers of units, becomes an operational black hole for logistics, and usually gives nothing in return. 

But they can't back out, because the whole world is watching! This is the first real urban battle of the war and Russia can win it, because Mariupol ain't Kharkiv let alone Kyiv. So ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."" Not only can they win it, they have to. Russia needs something they can be positive about. It's either win it or accept another loss.

Blair is the obvious exception. He was fully and enthusiastically behind everything, but then again sadly the uk is basically the US' lapdog. Maybe as a brit I just have a very different perspective on Nato membership to people like yourself *shrugs*

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"I haven't heard people talk about the gas discovered in Ukraine as a Russian motivation for war in Ukraine. They talk about Russian national identity or Ukraine becoming more ""liberalized"" or Ukraine getting close to NATO. Those are all important. I personally think the Yuzivka gas field is a huge contributing factor to Russia's motivations.

First, lets look at the revolution that happened in the USA of the shale gas revolution. It started around 2010. It involves a complicated process of ""breaking"" the shale rock apart using ""fracking."" It was very successful at unlocking huge natural gas reservoirs in the USA. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Natural_Gas_Production_1990-2040.jpg

Second, the Yuzivka natural gas field was found in Eastern Ukraine around 2010. This field is estimated at about 1-5 Trillion cubic meters of gas (always take the reserve numbers as a grain of salt, production is what matters). It appears to be in a similar shale formation as the USA. So quite a bit. By comparison, all of Europe uses about 300-500 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Roughly 30% comes from Russia. The rest comes from the UK, Norway, and LPG imports. LPG imports makes up about 100 billion cubic meters. 

https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51358
https://www.statista.com/statistics/265406/natural-gas-consumption-in-the-eu-in-cubic-meters/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_in_Ukraine

Third, Ukraine has been able to boost production to about 20 billion cubic feet per year. If they are able to boost production, like the USA has, getting up to 35-40 would mean Ukraine is self sufficient and any higher would cut into Russia's ability to manipulate Europe with gas. Also, Ukraine would be a direct competitor to Russia, with a distance advantage (Ukraine is closer to Europe). 

Four, Europe has been trying really hard to find alternative sources of gas. Especially the Eastern block. Germany with Nordstream has been the one big exception. 

Five, The advancement of EVs and Renewable energy have made oil less important and natural gas more important. Additionally, countries moving away from coal (and nuclear for Germany) have made natural gas used more to generate electricity. This has made natural gas a more valuable commodity and increased Europe's dependance on natural gas. 

Six, look at the location of the natural gas fields in relation to the recent conflict map. I don't really need to say much on this, even if the gas field borders are not perfect. https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ty9lep/ukraine_conflict_map_overlaid_with_yuzivska_gas/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

What does this all mean? Well, Russia desperately needs a win. Getting Odessa seems to be off the table. So gaining control of the natural gas fields would be a major victory for Russia. I suspect they will focus ALL of their forces into gaining control of the natural gas fields. 

Additionally, this natural gas was a huge contributing factor to causing Russia the motivation to go to war. If Russia does not gain control of this natural gas field, Ukraine will be in direct threat to Russia's influence over Europe. Anytime there is a direct threat to a country's influence, you can expect that war may flare up.",42e58bd580470668361091eaf7538e2c27853f2d,True,False,,,,,0,1649435906,,0,{},i3x57ev,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t3_tz1x8g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i3x57ev/,1649435921,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649407106.0

Ukrainian forces have been mobile to great effectiveness where they need to be, and static in the JFO because their objective is to be as static as possible to prevent Russian advance and maneuver. Again, if a lack of mobility has been a problem in the JFO it's been just as much of an issue for Russian forces since they haven't been able to exploit it. Ties go to the defender here (assuming it's even an issue, which I don't believe to be true).

&gt;I don't see the strategic benefit of Mariupol.

Well that's just it, isn't it? If it's not that strategically important, Russia's foolish for devoting so much effort to it's capture as opposed to encircling and destroying a huge portion of the Ukrainian army. *That's* the strategic value: it kept the Ukrainian forces from being annihilated by a superior numerical force with heavier fires.

&gt;Once these 7,000-8,000 Ukrainian soldiers are gone the Russians will be able to redeploy their 15,000 elsewhere.

This isn't a video game. Taking a city is a high intensity operation that tends to incur significant losses (which there is documented evidence has happened in Mariupol). The infantry forces that finish taking the city will likely be spent and ineffective for other operations for an indeterminate period of time. Meanwhile, Ukraine can reinforce, resupply, and reposition to take the real objective, encircling and destroying the Ukrainian army in the JFO, that much more difficult.",35f7017bdd0585ebb9a26331348b6dc74efd511a,True,False,,,,,0,1649431837,,0,{},i3wui7d,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t1_i3wkwrh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i3wui7d/,1649431850,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649403037.0

But that's a decision made at the very highest levels of strategic power. They do the top level intelligence assessment and tell the operational commanders what the enemy is going to do who then tell the tactical commands. 

How is anyone supposed to predict the Russian commander in chief, FSB, MOD, and general staff, would essentially ignore the threat of Ukrainian resistance? That essentially means that those making predictions are supposed to think as totally stupid and irrationally as Putin did, because that's the only way they can be correct.

I'll just use myself as an example. I didn't even think the invasion would happen because they didn't bring enough troops (200,000 is too few for a country as big as Ukraine), it was the very start of the mud season making them round bound and easier to defend against, and they'd embarrass themselves because NATO weaponry was going to gut them. But I still thought they'd succeed in taking ground, I just didn't think they'd be able to hold it against an insurgency. Because I couldn't predict they'd not even tell their troops they were invading until hours before and therefore not even have time to plan or rehearse or even mentally prepare for combat. I couldn't predict they didn't mass forces and instead dispersed them on scores of different routes going in competing directions; when I first saw the invasion map the next day I literally laughed out loud. FF, they launched 120 km VDV deep air assaults to airfields all around Kyiv and sent Spetsnaz in civilian clothes to do all sorts of sabotage and assassination missions but didn't secure the fucking rail hubs at the border which all got blown up. They didn't take out the communication nodes until hitting 3G towers days in, which only ended up fucking themselves. Their comm plan relied extensively on unsecured single channel comms as if this was 1941.

Who in the right mind could have predicted that? Even the Russian troops couldn't predict it, they're the ones who got stuck following the worst invasion plan concocted since the Bay of Pigs.

[],False,,jrex035,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k929ak,False,False,"&gt;I find the lack of mobility particularly interesting. That's something that was noticeable since the start of the war.

Why would Ukraine be very mobile in their defense? They're holding territory, it doesn't take massed armored vehicle maneuvers to do this. On top of that, it actually benefited the Ukrainian defense to let Russian forces, especially in the North, overextend themselves so that Ukraine could raid their poorly secured supply lines/rear areas. The lack of large scale Ukrainian maneuvers isn't conspicuous, it's good strategy, especially since Russia largely dominates the air. 

&gt;Cassad attributes it to the Ukrainian military's ""[mental] attachment to the prepared dug-in positions"" (which is a traditional Russian/Soviet weakness that can be traced back at least a century), but also to the lack of fuel.

Entrenchments aren't a hindrance, they're a benefit as we've seen in this conflict as Russia has struggled to advance in the JFO where most Ukrainian emplacements are located. What is interesting is how badly Russian efforts to turn the flanks on those defensive lines have been. You'd think encircling Ukrainian forces in the JFO would've been a primary objective at the outset of the war, instead were 5 weeks in and it's unlikely Russia will *ever* be able to close the pocket. 

&gt;I would add the shock value of some serious losses the Ukrainians suffered in the first few days of the invasion trying to move big units within the Russian air force ""belt of activity"" (about 100km behind the Ukrainian front lines).

The only major Ukrainian losses I can think of was in the South where Ukrainian military leadership betrayed their troops and left their forces with their asses hanging out. Hence major losses of Ukrainian armor around Kherson taken out by helicopters and aircraft. 

Clearly Ukrainian forces haven't been hindered too badly by a lack of maneuver as they were able to kick Russian forces out of the entire North and they're currently threatening Russian positions in Kherson.",74ba1011429c52bc94c13b158678975ce07fd988,True,False,,,,,0,1649430355,,0,{},i3wqmwy,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t1_i3wfaik,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i3wqmwy/,1649430374,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649401555.0

A Nuclear Success Story

On Christmas Day in 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the Soviet Union, resigned his position and handed over his powers, including control of the Soviet nuclear launch codes, to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The Cold War was officially over and people around the world celebrated. But some in the U.S., including Senators Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar, were worried—the dissolution of the Soviet Union had overnight led to the creation of three new nuclear-armed countries: Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.

These new countries were struggling to put together functioning governments and had few resources and little expertise to handle the legacy of the decades-long nuclear arms race left behind in their territory. Furthermore, as Nunn and Lugar knew all too well, the security for the nuclear material in these new countries was often woefully inadequate, leaving this material vulnerable to being stolen by terrorists or rogue nations.

The senators prepared legislation that authorized the US to pay to secure what came to be known as “loose nukes”; however, the Nunn-Lugar program was largely ignored by then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Cold War thinking still dominated the security world, while Bill Perry and Dr. Ash Carter were developing new ways of thinking about security, called Preventive Defense, that focused on preventing potential conflicts before they could start.

After the election of Bill Clinton, Bill Perry rose to the position of Secretary of Defense. With the help of Ash Carter and a team of (mostly female) security experts, we were able to safely remove and dismantle over 8,000 nuclear weapons, and countless missiles and bombers, and neutralize the threat of these loose nukes. But the task was fiendishly difficult, complicated by a reluctant Congress, prickly politicians from the new countries, unique technical problems, and several near-death travel experiences in the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Millions of people die? Russia already invaded Ukraine. They're already using heavy fires and incendiaries against population centers. They already fucked up the invasion bad enough they'll likely lose the war. The Ukrainians already chose to resist as much as possible and they're the ones begging for support, they WANT to be a proxy.

&gt;Not to mention that 'destroying the russian army' is in itself probably a terrible idea.

The Russian army is essentially going to get destroyed anyway. It's already well on its way. Casualties are in the many tens of thousands at this point and those are mostly in their combat units. They've lost a significant amount of their combat power already.

&gt;Defensive weaponry is probably where it should end really.

That keeps the conflict going longer. The less decisions it is, especially once it enters the stage of fixed lines, the more bloody it gets.

And why are you so motivated to ensure Ukraine can't retake the ground it's lost? Does Donbas belong to the Russians now? Should they just rely on bayonets to do it so to ensure they fail?

The US and Russia still maintain the New START nuclear treaty where they each individually go and inspect the other's nuclear weapons 18 times a year including a broad range of weapons. It was paused due to COVID but is expected to continue very soon. 

&gt; The treaty provides for 18 on-site inspections per year for U.S. and Russian inspection teams:  Type One inspections focus on sites with deployed and non-deployed strategic systems (up to 10 per year), and Type Two inspections focus on sites with only non-deployed strategic systems (up to 8 per year).  Permitted inspection activities include confirming the number of reentry vehicles on one deployed ICBM or SLBM per Type One inspection, counting nuclear weapons onboard or attached to deployed heavy bombers, counting numbers of non-deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, confirming weapon system conversions or eliminations are conducted in the way proposed, and confirming facility eliminations.

&gt; During inspections of deployed strategic weapon bases/facilities, each side must disclose how many warheads are on each delivery vehicle based at the inspected base, and the inspecting country has the right to inspect the loading on one delivery vehicle (chosen by the inspecting country) to confirm the declaration is accurate

The Ukrainians as I said.  From your own link:
&gt;**Ukrainian government sources initially stated that 13 border guards, representing the entirety of the Ukrainian military presence on the island, were killed after refusing to surrender.[20][21]**

&gt;Russian defence media presented an alternative version of events, claiming that 82 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner after surrendering voluntarily,[11] and had been taken to Sevastopol.[22] Russian ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed that the prisoners had been signing pledges promising not to continue military action against Russia, and would be released soon.[23]

&gt;The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine later announced that the guards might instead have been captured,[24] based on the Russian reports that they were being held as prisoners of war.[25] On 26 February 2022 it issued a statement saying that they believed ""that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiiniy Island may be alive"".[22] **On 28 February 2022, the Ukrainian Navy posted on its Facebook page that all the border guards of the island were alive and detained by the Russian Navy.[26][27]**

Next:
&gt;""Additionally, their claimed vehicle kills have thus-far tracked really close to OSINT data.""

&gt;He literally told you what it's based upon. Do you know what open source intelligence is? What exactly are you basing your ""feelings"" on?

What his stuff is based on is unverified pictures posted by the Ukrainians.  We don't know where the vehicles came from in the pictures, just what the authors of them claimed.

(original: https://colonelcassad.livejournal.com/7547487.html)

**OTG ""Sever""** located in the Luhansk direction included two mechanized brigades, one motorized infantry brigade, two air assault brigades, with the support of the 26th artillery brigade. Units of the 8th Regiment of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces also operated in the area of ​​responsibility of the group. Units from the 40th Artillery Brigade and the 17th Armored Brigade were brought in to reinforce the combined-arms and air assault formations.  
In total, the Sever OTG in its composition before the start of active hostilities could have battalion tactical groups (BTGR) - 17, tanks up to 160, field artillery guns - 320, MLRS installations - 90  
  
**Vostok OTG** located in the Donetsk-Mariupol direction included in two mechanized brigades, one motorized infantry brigade, a marine brigade and an airborne brigade, supported by 55 independent artillery brigade. In total, the Vostok OTG could include 19 battalion tactical groups, up to 160 tanks, 250 field artillery guns, and 90 MLRS installations.  
Parts of the direct subordination of the JFO command included a separate tank brigade (90 tanks, BTGR), an airmobile brigade (3 BTGR), a separate artillery brigade - 72 high-power guns, two rocket artillery brigades (REABR) - 72 Uragan MLRS, 54 Smerch MLRS ”, Missile brigade (RBR) OTR 12 Tochka-U launchers.  
  
In total, in the grouping of troops for action in the JFO, the operation command concentrated 76,000 people, including 39 BTGRs, 320 tanks, more than 1,000 lightly armored vehicles, 642 self-propelled and towed artillery mounts, more than 300 MLRS systems, 42 fighters, 45 attack aircraft and front-line bombers, as well as 34 attack helicopters.  
  
**Strengths of the Armed Forces of Ukraine include**:  
  
\- direct information and intelligence support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine using NATO air and space-based intelligence and technical means;  
\- provision of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with reconnaissance and communications equipment, anti-tank weapons and MANPADS of the NATO standard;  
\- high training of artillery units, saturation of battle formations with artillery, MLRS and anti-tank weapons;  
\- high training and combat experience of soldiers and commanders, morale, devotion of many military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to criminal nationalist beliefs and Nazi ideals.  
  
**Weaknesses** include a weak fleet, insufficient training of aviation units and military air defense, the attachment of combined arms units and subunits to prepared positions, low maneuverability of troops, the current shortage in manpower and equipment, the impossibility of replenishing losses in equipment, low preparedness of reservists, their lack of motivation . And with the beginning and during the conduct of hostilities, shortcomings in command and control were revealed, weak maneuverability indicators affected the refusal to conduct counterattacks and counterattacks agreed upon in time and place, as well as timely counteraction to Russian troops advancing in all directions. For the first two weeks, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were torn apart by plugging gaps in the defense and could not demonstrate organized resistance outside populated areas. This contributed to the transition to a new defense tactic based on settlements and cover by the local population, which demonstrates the weaknesses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, the most combat-ready and numerous grouping in the JFO zone, bound by LDNR corps in the Donetsk and Lugansk operational directions, was unable to allocate the necessary forces to support its troops in other directions, which forced the country's military-political leadership to resort to an informal form of mobilizing the population through the free distribution of weapons and the formation of city self-defense detachments, the so-called territorial defense detachments, which often turned into unruly armed gangs that did not obey anyone and often opened friendly fire on the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Second...

&gt;Even more simply, applying Occam's razor with regards to the lack of Russian air superiority that was expected, is in itself rather compelling evidence that the Russian air force is not conducting itself in a manner that would be expected of an air force that is flying unimpeded of air defence assets.

This is a facetious argument. The lack of Russian air operations resulting in air superiority does not prove or explain anything. It merely shows that that they are not conducting themselves in a manner *presumed* by many. This is also why I mentioned in my original post that there is much that is mystifying about this Russian operation.

For example, Russian military doctrine lays a lot of emphasis on prepping the battlespace with intensive artillery strikes. This has been a distinctive feature of their doctrine since WW2. Most recently we saw this in Grozny and also, to some extent, in Georgia l. But oddly this has been absent in Ukraine. The question is why? Similarly, the Russian forces are known to overwhelm their adversaries by mass instead of manoeuvre. Again, this is a distinctive feature.od their doctrine despite being originators of the ""deep strike "" doctrine. This again has been curiously in this operation. Again, the question is why? Why did the Russians not use short range missiles to flatten Ukrainian defensive.positions and to target Ukranian cities and use their infantry for mopping up operations (however expensive that may have been for them given the ferocity of the Ukrainian defence)? Again, it's very mystifying. 

There is much about this Russian operation in Ukraine that is odd and which does not ring true to their established doctrine or at least what we in the West know of them.",873d42cf36c2060d0d8e518c5274a57796e0e531,True,False,,,,,0,1649421716,,0,{},i3w5w0u,False,t3_tyoapc,False,True,t1_i3vz5yr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyoapc/getting_serious_about_sead_european_air_forces/i3w5w0u/,1649421728,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649392916.0

Not so fast. While fixed radar, known SAM sites, and C2 sites would've been targeted immediately, Ukrainian SAMs are all mobile except for the S-125 (which I'll get to). Additionally, it would seem that they've been excelling at emitting and moving or shooting and moving, often not staying long enough to get hit (although some have been taken out). Russian mobile SAMs are very difficult to target against, even with wild weasels in the area. HARMs aren't very accurate if a radar turns off right away, and newer SAM systems can detect ARM launches and react accordingly. In the 90s, Serb ADA systems moved frequently, complicating targeting. For the F-117 shootdown, that was a S-125. The S-125, a ""fixed"" SAM that required extensive set-up/break down, was commanded by Lt Col Zoltan Dani who constantly moved and drilled his men. It paid off when they shot down the F-117.

The both seem to get pretty good value for money out of many of their systems. Something like S-400 or J-20 show that while corruption will play a role in making thing slower and more difficult to develop than would be possible without it, you can still get a pretty advanced high functioning state with it. 

Especially as inspecting these things will be a very high priority to the ex KGB Siloviki who form the real power in Russia.

The one high end system we have the most insight to is their space program given we are actually pretty deeply embedded. Its run by Dimitry Rogozin, your classic oligarch. Street thug turned Putin placeman who has embezzled out of Roscosmos but never at the kind of rate that does real damage. The damage is mostly from low investment vs the missions its given. So we have a data point. 

Other data points is that very high end systems like new strategic rockets and submarines have come online and look at a very good spec. We cannot take too great an inference on the actual Strategic Rocket Forces and the other components of their nuclear program but it does seem likely the ""embezzling"" is kept on a leash.

1. i can't see how ukrainian forces don't return this sort of stuff in kind. When people are desperate and emotions are high, things aren't going to go well imo.

2. We keep forgetting the lessons of WW2. Decrying populations as innately evil is a terrible mistake. We know that even the most upstanding of humans can commit atrocities given the right circumstances. I've seen a lot of very dangerous rhetoric flying around about the russian people, and that sort of thing never ends well.

&gt; The brilliant take of ""Russia is bad we should punish them for being bad"" is... not credible to say the least - more so, it's counter-productive to the outcomes we actually desire.

People have a habit of making emotional/political decisions in the moment and based on the specific context of the issue at hand, without considering the principle of the action or the wider implications. For example, seizing Russia's foreign reserves seems like a great move because russia bad, but we've now set a precedent that a nation's foreign reserves can be seized on a political whim and that's extremely dangerous imo. Honestly if i were a non-western country i'd be extremely concerned about continuing to use the western financial system (though america's escalating use of unilateral extra-territorial sanctions in recent years in theory should have already turned everyone away tbh).

A different example would be Shamima Begum, a british national who joined isis. She's been stripped of her citizenship and left stateless, and everyone supports it because... well... she joined isis and isis bad. But now we've set a precedent where the UK government can unilaterally strip british citizens of their citizenship without trial, without any justification and without the means to appeal.... on a political whim. We have by law created an underclass of british citizens based on ethnicity. As a matter of principle it is disgusting.

Brzezinski (our own national security advisor under Carter and Johnson) basically called NATO the American protectorate. De Gaulle left the NATO command structure to pursue greater autonomy.

And looking at the NATO command structure, it is completely under American control. The General Secretary is a PR figurehead dedicated to preserving relations among member states, and is always a European, who understands European politics.

But the SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe) of NATO is **always** a US general, the head of US European Command. In other words, all of NATO's forces report to a US general who reports to the US president. In other words, an American-dominated, American-controlled alliance whose members generally perform roles dictated by the American military (this last part isn't necessarily because of the command structure, but more because of the inability of smaller countries to field militaries that can perform every task; instead, they focus on capabilities within the NATO alliance).

So yes, a very tough sell. Personally, I'd agree with Kennan or Mearsheimer- NATO was to keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.

There's a pretty high barrier to getting someone to abandon their life. Nationalism, cultural familiarity, language barriers, loss of support network, friends, family, job opportunities/transferability of skills etc etc are all things you need to overcome.

And, if they did then what is the evidence for that? (2) What is the nature of SEAD/DEAD in conditions where counter-air and air-to-ground ops may be waged using drones. And (3) the article is - though a ""commentary"" - is bereft of any meaningful references.

For example, the article asserts: ""In spite of over 1,000 Russian cruise- and ballistic-missile launches, which have had significant success against Ukrainian radars and S-300 long-range SAM batteries, mobile Ukrainian SAMs remain active and so Russian air superiority remains elusive.""

While this may be true (albeit without any corroborating evidence), it does not suggest that the Russian Air Force was actively attempting to engage in serious SEAD operations to achieve air superiority. Why this may have been so is open to speculation (like many other things about this Russian offensive into Ukraine).

What would be interesting to see (though I have no idea how to map this from open sources) is what is the density of Russian air and counter-air operations across the battlespace (though I am sure the US/NATO Intel outfits would have done this) and where it is being concentrated. This would give a fair idea as to where the primary thrust of the Russian AF was/is and what is it that they are trying to achieve.

If you mean small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), then yes, MANPADS will not help much. But larger drones like Reapers are very much susceptible to MANPADS, and sUAS are not currently a major platform for CAS, although I expect that to change very, very soon. As in it is currently changing in the midst of this very conflict. But my main point was that the US military, as it is currently equipped, wouldn't necessarily be able to achieve complete air superiority because of the effectiveness of A2AD tactics/weapons like MANPADS. I'm quite sure that will change, but it hasn't yet.

&gt; Unless the latest MANPADs can effectively reach aircraft or drones operating at high altitudes. 

They can. Ranges obviously vary by weapon but Stingers for example can hit things at 26k ft. The challenge being that a person on the ground isn't going to easily detect a vehicle at that altitude, especially a drone. And if they can detect it visually or by noise, that doesn't mean they'll be able to pull the MANPADS shot off. In any case, the main point is that they make it much harder to provide CAS because most extant US CAS platforms are slow, non-stealth vehicles designed to loiter for long periods of time at relatively low altitudes over a target area. Which is what you want for CAS. You want the planes circling within visual range of the target area, continuously providing intel and ready to strike at a moment's notice once they're needed by ground troops. The closer they are to the ground, the more accurate the intel and the quicker the fire support, but also the greater the risk from ground-based AA. That was fine in Afghanistan and Iraq where the US could rely on their enemies not having any AA capabilities at all, but likely doesn't translate well to a conflict with a near peer adversary.",e035ed71c929d8c0bc9499b34aba210e897eb66a,True,False,,,,,0,1649395699,,0,{},i3v47w2,False,t3_tyoapc,False,True,t1_i3uv6ah,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyoapc/getting_serious_about_sead_european_air_forces/i3v47w2/,1649395717,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649366899.0

You're looking at ~$10Billion for one, and that's excluding any tech research you might need to do to stay on the cutting edge.

The only way you pay for such things is if it produces millions of chips, so each ship costs a reasonable amount. 

Secondly, you need an incredibly specialised workforce. It's not like there's a huge pool of labourers you hire and train up here - the process takes years if not decades. 

Such an industry tends towards concentration. It's hard to setup a market structure that doesn't result in concentration. 

Various nations have tried *really hard* to generate their own local chipmaking industries. China has spent billions trying to do so, and they are on 14nm at best. They'll probably be stuck there until they can find a different source of EUV equipment, as the US a blocked exports to Chinese semi firms. 

There's basically 3 blocks in the world that could absorb the costs needed to set up cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing: The USA, The EU, and China. Notably, all have some existing industry, and have stepped up at least somewhat since the covid chip shortage started. Though EU's effort is mostly focused on chips-for-cars, so hardly the cutting edge. I'll also throw in Japan, because they have a quite good sector already, it's just not on the bleeding edge. But way easier for them given the existing technical know-how. 

I don't think any middle power could afford to do it now. Taiwan and Korea got on the ship earlier, when it was much cheaper - and once on the bleeding edge, spent enough money to stay there, reaping big rewards as they kept their share of the market.

[],False,,AnarchoPlatypi,,,[],,,,text,t2_166xhd,False,False,"I think there are some good political reasons why the West has been somewhat hesitant to give the Ukrainians non-defensive weapons. 

Despite the slava ukraini sentiment, and the fact that Ukraine is clearly the side to root for in this war, it's still the second most corrupt country in Europe only after Russia, and even then that corruption might be less organized. They also have an actual problem with fascism abd fascist symphatisers. Just reading the Wikipedia article on Bandera illuminates this side, with a third of Ukrainians thinking the guy should be celebrated, and some Ukrainian politicians having actual pictures of the guy on their walls. Hell, even during the war thr Ukrainian Armed forces have slipped up in publicity and evoked Bandera as a national hero. The ultra-nationalist elements also feel that places like Rostov and parts of Poland are rightfully theirs, and if Ukraine starts crushing the Russians with counterattacks there's certainly going to be some political pressure to continue offensives over the pre-2014 border in to Russia.

After the war is done, even if Ukraine wins the war, there is also a problem of reconstruction. Ukraines economy will take a hit, and a period of reconstruction and austerity is ripe for corruption, and influence from Western competitors like China.

There is a real worry of something like the Balkan situation repeating. The West most probably does not want its drones and weapons ending up on the black market, nor in Chinese hands. This is not necessarily up to the state, as the weapons in the field can't be properly accounted for and irregular units are being given western equipment.

And of course, the elephant in the room: West may not want Russian military to be destroyed in Ukraine. If it seems like Russia is going to definitely lose (ie. Lose occupied Crimea and Donbass), or that it's going to lose its relevancy on the world stage, there's a real chance that it's going to threathen nuclear use. No one in the West wants to risk a nuclear war over Ukraine, because Ukraine, in the end, means nothing to the West. It's not in NATO and it's a corrupt bit player on the edge of Europe. Geopolitics has no friends, only interests and all that shit.

Not to mention that in case of Ukraine starting to push towards Crimea and occupied Donbass, Russia might very well mobilize, especially as it considers Crimea to be Russia-proper. This is also an escalation the West probably doesn't want for multiple reasons, one of them being the increased risk of further escalation.

And of course as unbelieveable as it sounds, the west may not want Putin to be ousted. Humiliating Russia increases risk of the man being ousted, and no one wants to see what happens if Putin actually thinks there's a western coup coming for him, as then we get back to the nuclear question.

Also, the bigger players have been very careful with their choice of words about it, and the truth is that Putin might be  ""the devil we know"" situation. No one knows who comes after Putin  and we can't really influence that. Even the most prominent opposition figures like Navalnyi are deeply nationalistic and have quite problematic views on many fronts, and it's unclear wether they truly stand against Russias imperialistic ambitions, or simply say it to gain clout in the West. Putins replacement might be even more trigger happy and care less about playing with the nuclear button.

And then there's the whole ""military industrial complex needs an enemy"" thing.

So, in conclusion, the West has a vested  interest to keep Ukraine supplied well enough that it can keep Russia at bay and push them back in a limited fashion, but not so well that Russia has to either escalate, or lose Crimea/Donbass and face humiliation. It must also consider the long term consequences of arming Ukraine, and the less-than-stellar realities of the Ukrainian society.",9d4e29b145e73695df31a9dcd044c60ce0c97947,True,False,,,,,0,1649390656,,0,{},i3uvkng,False,t3_tybcfi,False,True,t1_i3uk9gm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tybcfi/ukraine_conflict_daily_megathread/i3uvkng/,1649390672,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649361856.0

75 wouldn't be ""all"" of the planned fleet. Also, buying more B-21s, increasing sorties, reducing bomb weight and increasing payload all decrease the amount of the fleet required. 4 40,000 pound payload B-21s using 25 pound glidebombs could do it in 8 sorties. Regardless, massing forces generally results in *less* risk.

&gt;But a back up to that should be being able to fight and win on the ground. And just as importantly, we should seek to deter them from want to get into a ground fight. If we leave a gap in our capabilities then that is exactly where they will aim to take the fight.

The range ""gap"" being a net-negative is holistically debatable. If artillery-targeting is best done *from above*, and the US could achieve monopoly, then *shorter* range could *maximize* indirect fire capacity. 105mms are cheaper than 155mms. Others could argue $15m SPAs are worse than 150 equivalently ranged suicide UAVs.

Annoyingly, none of this addressed the HVP's range or interception capacity either. If 155mm SPAs could intercept rocket artillery, aircraft munitions and/or aircraft, then it screws up the calculus everyone's using here. Ironically, I suspect the author's ""100km Excalibur"" is actually the HVP.

&gt;Besides there have been many times that leaders have theorized that air power can will wars all on their own. And these theories have been wrong every single time. Could it be possible at some point in the future? Sure, but betting the house on it is unwise in my opinion.

Who are you to say that? These range increases require equivalent munitions/sensors that failed the USAF in Desert Storm while simultaneously replacing the *range disadvantaged* artillery the US Army won with. Semi-relatedly, the US Army's Desert Storm direct-fire wins were mostly due to *sensor advantages* and around half the kills were from ATGM-firing Bradleys that cost 1/3 an Abrams.

Maybe an F-35 can blow past a Stinger or equivalent, but anything non-stealth loitering under 25k feet AGL or so would be at serious risk. Meaning basically most forms of CAS, especially those that don't rely exclusively on standoff-range smart munitions: Apaches, AC-130s, Reapers, F-16s, A-10s, etc. While that doesn't make CAS impossible, it does raise the costs significantly, which in turn reduces the support available to ground forces.

Then again, maybe MANPADS are only this effective in Ukraine because they are Western tech pitted against crappy legacy Russian tech, and so Americans in fact have nothing to worry about in a similar conflict directly involving US troops.

&gt;	The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty. Any State so invited may become a Party to the Treaty by depositing its instrument of accession with the Government of the United States of America. The Government of the United States of America will inform each of the Parties of the deposit of each such instrument of accession.

Note, “European State.” The North American members of NATO were included when the treaty was ratified, but there is no way to add more if you interpret the treaty literally. You could argue it means “European” in a cultural sense, I suppose. 


And yes, the Cold War was full of missteps from American foreign policy, the Cuban missile crisis included. Notably, however, the Cuban missile crisis did not end in war, but a negotiated settlement. Regardless, American and European foreign policy has evolved since 1962, including a focus on national sovereignty and internationalism. 


Finally, “realism” is not the organizing principle of international relations that you may think it is. As a theory it is considered obsolete at best by most political scientists, and nonsense at worst. “States care about security” is not an insightful observation except to the newest student of politics. It fails to account for complex international relations or why states dedicate so much time and effort to international organizations and economic development. It makes no mention of leaders or economics or ideology, all of which can change state behavior by altering the way in which they interpret “security.” The truth is that while the international system might truthfully be called “anarchy” in the sense that there is no leader, regional and global institutions create contexts and even hierarchies in which states modify their security seeking behavior, and have done so for centuries. The United Nations and NATO are examples of such institutions. The Concert of Europe, the Holy Roman Empire, the Catholic Church, the Shogunate in Japan, Chinese cultural hegemony, and the Islamic caliphate are others. 

All of this to say that yes, the definition of “provocation” can indeed change, and Russia’s behavior is less security seeking and more revisionist in the current context. Their leadership and ideology dislikes the current state of security seeking within the global context and wishes to redefine it along lines more similar to their past. But they are seeing right now the limits of violence as a means of ensuring security within the current international system.

For example Oryx tanks count is -30% below Ukrainian tank count, but between Oryx's massive backlog (over 200 Russian pics according to their twitter), destroyed tanks nobody took pictures of, tanks destroyed so hard they're impossible to recognize etc., I find Ukrainian number completely credible.
