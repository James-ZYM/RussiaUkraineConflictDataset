Obviously I agree with you and I think it’s a matter of time.

The larger picture is that Russian people are not as oblivious to the facts as many think in the west. Many know exactly what is happening but they choose to selectively bury their hands in the sand - even when confronted with obvious evidence. 

Sad fact is that people have made up their minds and have set up camp in their respective positions. Not unique to russia btw. Look at France nearly half of people are supporting Kremlin funded candidate - what a joke!

&gt;  
&gt;Welcome to the 21st century.  We are in an information war.  Social media platforms are a warspace where we battle for control of each other's minds.  Words are our weapons.  If you speak the truth in my zone of control, you will draw no fire from me.  Tell a lie in my zone and I will work you up.  
&gt;  
&gt;When I detect a troll spreading disinformation in my warspace, I attack them with my words, and they use theirs.  I know I can't change their mind, and they know they can't change mine, but we both know that we aren't talking to each other, we are talking to all of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you fall for their lies, you may join their side.  If you accept my truths, you might join mine.  If I am routinely successful in exposing their lies, they will soon learn my name,  and start attacking me personally with insults and veiled threats.  They want to upset me and make me mad, so I will stop thinking critically and start reacting emotionally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyone that word clouds my comment history will probably see a big giant ""FUCK COMPLETELY OFF"" right in the middle.  That's when I step away from the screen, take a short break, and consider my next words very carefully.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every social media platform has its rules.  If I break even just one of those rules just one time, I risk a permanent ban on that platform.  If a troll gets me banned from an online platform, they just internet killed me.  I no longer occupy the warspace, and the troll has won.  They can now freely spread their lies without any pestering from the likes of me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Encouraging self-harm, or making violent threats is a very efficient way to get yourself quickly and permanently ""killed"" in most virtual warspaces.  I am usually allowed to tell people to fuck off.  I am almost never allowed to tell people to kill themselves.  If the warspace does not permit insults, I can usually say ""Fuck off!"", but if I say ""Fuck off you piece of shit!""- BAN!  and I am internet dead.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have been on Reddit for over 8 years.  I had never received a warning from Reddit Admins in all that time, until this war in Ukraine started.  Being a witness to war crimes is not easy.  Seeing them, and not completely losing my shit about it, very hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;Be careful out there.  Stand your ground, but watch what you say.  Every subreddit has its own rules.  Be sure you read, understand and follow those rules very closely, so you do not get trolled into a ban.

I literally copy pasted this on my Facebook profile. I started some ""comments"" war too on Twitter...got a warning past week, i started telling people their head was full of shit..no regrets",ec3ab0ee10c88965005c6d3c61872c3fa30703c2,True,False,,,,,0,1649776679,,0,{},i4fru5q,False,t3_u1fxsu,False,True,t1_i4chenm,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u1fxsu/i_swear_to_god_clare_daly_must_be_receiving/i4fru5q/,1649776692,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649747879.0,

The Russian military is indiscriminately killing and raping and torturing the Ukrainians while their population shrugs and says they can't do anything because there might be some personal sacrifice involved on their part to make it stop. These are not comparable situations. 

How bad does it have to get before people stop giving them a collective pass? 

-The rape of an 83 year old woman in front of her disabled husband? (Already happened.)
-The rape of children? (Already happened.)
-Mass executions of civilians? (Already happened.)
-Starving a population and cutting them off? (Already happened.)
-Bombing shelters full of civilians? (Already happened.)
-Bombing women and children at train stations? (Already happened.)
-Shooting and bombing evacuation corridors until they're graveyards on the road? (Already happened.)

There are so many examples that I could sit here all day listing them.

So yeah, the ""entire Russian population"" needs to get over their fear and speak the fuck up, or realize they are complicit and stop crying about it. I don't feel sorry for them.

There is no raping and killing of women and children by Ukraine. Ukraine has done nothing but act in self defense, after handing over it's nuke in exchange for Russia to promise not to invade. Yet here we are, not only an invasion but a cruel genocide (as is very common and well documented in Russian history).

Some streets look very nice - brick houses, clean cars, tall trees, nothing run-down.  Only oddity I noticed was no sidewalks.  Some of the outskirts neighborhoods look more slummy - badly paved streets, potholes.  I tried 5-6 different streets in different areas.  I saw nothing that looked like a town after shelling and looting.  Maybe there are old industrial centers which look like a post-apocalyptic movie, but I didn't see them.  I've been told that the area around the sea of Azov looks like that, as well, thanks to Soviet policy, not the nature of the local ethnic group.

I'm not saying there's no poverty in Russia, and I'm not saying that poverty plays no role in recruitment.  What I'm asking is, to what extent is this more true of Russia than of other countries with volunteer armies?  It may be, for example, that the bored Rubtsovsk teenager who finds himself fighting in Ukraine is not more naturally inclined to murder than the Chicago teenager who finds himself in Iraq.  

Under this theory, it would be less the fault of Russian upbringing, and more the fault of the Russian army.  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers, they don't give them any means of protecting themselves, the soldiers even have to steal food to stay alive, and discipline suffers.  Troops from any nation, put in this situation for a long time, would suffer a disintegration of discipline, with all the resulting bad results.  If this is the reason, you could blame Putin, you could blame the Russian army, you could blame a lot of things, but to say that rural Russians are simply naturally bloodthirsty would be wrong.

It is not just pilots that need training.

In easy to understand terms. Imagine your company uses pcs and is set up to use pcs.
Then it all switches to Macs. 
It isnt just buying macs. U need to buy all the dongles and hardware for it all. Then u need to buy new registered software foe your company for macs not pc.
Then u need to train your staff how to use a mac and all the software mac versions.
Then u need to completly retrain your tec staff how to fix macs or even be competant on them.

Solid point though: 35B vs 1B makes ""more sanctions"" pointless as their effect is limited to the people of Russia, rather than the rulers, oligarchy and the military.

So her point is that EU is enabling Russia in prolonging the war, we're effectively funding it, while at the same time depriving regular Russians of basic goods, and also ""suppporting"" Ukraine by giving them cents on the dollar/euro compared to Russia.

She's not right in believing Russia will be negotiated out of Ukraine though. They will stay, occupy, abuse, pillage, loot, rape, commit mass murder and eventually genocide.

One more where she's definately wrong:

&gt;NATO expansion eastward has also had a role to play in the deterioration of stability in the region.

NATO expansion: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:History\_of\_NATO\_enlargement.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:History_of_NATO_enlargement.svg)

If anything, NATO and its expansion led to consistent increase in stability in the region, and specifically in NATO territory. Never in the history of Europe has there been a peaceful time  that lasted this long (1945-2022 and counting, let's hope). The instability has always been outside of NATO states, and especially on former Soviet Union territory: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_wars\_involving\_Russia#Russian\_Federation\_(1991%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Russia#Russian_Federation_(1991%E2%80%93present)) . Which just provides proof that NATO expansion delivers stability, and Russian adventurism brings chaos, death, destruction.

People in this thread are wrong about Daly though: she's most definately not rooting for the Kremlin. She's a hopeful human being that still believes in a good world, where talking things out will bring solutions and positive changes. But right now, we're in a war rethoric, and talking things out is off the table.",bb06df3e5b2ce8c433dc408345052e452da2b9a7,True,False,,,,,0,1649750337,,0,{},i4eh5c7,False,t3_u1fxsu,False,False,t1_i4c5rom,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u1fxsu/i_swear_to_god_clare_daly_must_be_receiving/i4eh5c7/,1649750348,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649721537.0,

In March 2015, Andriy Diachenko, a spokesman for the Azov Brigade, told USA Today that 10% to 20% of the group's members are Nazis.

In June 2015, the Canadian defense minister declared that Canadian forces would not provide training or support to Azov Battalion. In 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives also passed a provision blocking any training of Azov members by American forces, citing its neo-Nazi connections. The House had previously passed amendments banning support of Azov between 2014 and 2017, but due to pressure from The Pentagon, the amendments were quietly lifted. This was protested by the Simon Wiesenthal Center which stated that lifting the ban highlighted the danger of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine.

Azov's founding member Andriy Biletsky, leader of the far right Social-National Assembly (SNA), had stated in 2010 that ""the historic mission of our nation"" was to lead the ""white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival […] a crusade against the Semite-led Untermenschen"", an ideology that political scientist Richard Sakwa traces to the National Integralism of 1920s and 1930s. In 2014, political science lecturer Ivan Katchanovski commented to Radio Sweden on the founder's origins as Patriot of Ukraine, saying: ""The SNA/PU [Patriot of Ukraine] advocates a neo-Nazi ideology along with ultranationalism and racism. The same applies to […] members of the Azov battalion and many football ultras and others who serve in this formation.""

Shaun Walker wrote in The Guardian that ""many of [Azov's] members have links with neo-Nazi groups, and even those who laughed off the idea that they are neo-Nazis did not give the most convincing denials"", citing swastika tattoos among the fighters and one who claimed to be a ""national socialist"". According to The Daily Beast, some of the group's members are ""neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and avowed anti-Semites"",[65] and ""numerous swastika tattoos of different members and their tendency to go into battle with swastikas or SS insignias drawn on their helmets make it very difficult for other members of the group to plausibly deny any neo-Nazi affiliations.""[107] Bellingcat, an investigative journalist group, has traced ties between the Azov movement and American white supremacist groups.",d6b7466f5d89eb58cee32745212437ab89fb4362,True,False,,,,,0,1649749934,,0,{},i4egnms,False,t3_u161c6,False,True,t1_i4bzcbb,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u161c6/video_from_the_azov_regiment_the_regiment_does/i4egnms/,1649749945,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649721134.0,

But there it is, just I suspected: spoken like a true repulsive sociopath--one with a rather pathetic cliche bag of the usual standard sociopath lame tricks: 

------------------------------------

1) Try to gaslight people into thinking there is something wrong with feeling empathy (ie: mocking infantile tones of ""oh you poor bleeding heart""). 

2) Try to gaslight people into thinking they are not allowed to have empathy in a current event/situation that is unfolding, because: 

A) ""Other people have it much worse! So you're not allowed to express empathy in this situation!"" 

B) ""You didn't express empathy about all the past events, so you're not allowed to express empathy now!"" 

------------------------------------

Nice try--actually a pretty lame cliche try!--but ya nobody here is buying what you are selling. 

Again, I'm kinda surprised it only took me 1 try to get you to show your true self.

We did have Ukraine turn over Russian nukes in the 90s. We did in atleast some way offer the prospect of future admission to the EU along with NATO. Enough so that Ukraine had a dream of doing so.

In one hand, thatt dream... That prospect (however slight) scared the fuck out of Russia. They know that Nato in a conventional conflict would destroy the Russian military. Nato has also expanded many many times eastward regardless of Russian protest. It would exert further western influence on a Russian boarder for which putin did not want. 

(Let's not get into Putins delusional belief of rebuilding the former USSR's sphere of influence)

However, on the other hand it is the right of any country to ally with whoever they wish to ally with. No country (Russia, the US or China etc) should dictate whom another nation can align itself with. If Ukraine wants to join Nato, than that is their want. If they wish to join the EU, that is their want. If they wanted to join Russia, that would be their want. 

That being said, if the United States believed that Cuba was on the cusp of joining a Russian alliance, what would the states do? Once Cuba joined that Russian led alliance, Cuba becomes untouchable. So your choice is pretty bleak if you won't tolerate a neighbor joining a alliance with a adversary.

In this scenario the states would be faced with two choices (assuming diplomacy etc did not end up preventing the situation from presenting itself) :

1) tolerate Cuba joining a Russian alliance and accepting all the trimmings that come with that (based, training, weapons, exercises) regardless of American national security concerns (founded or not)

OR

2) force change in Cuba through physical means before they join the alliance

What do you think the states would do?

At the end of the day, I stand with Ukraine 10 out of 10 times. But, that does not mean we can not be critical of our own western actions leading up to this point in time.

1506,[],False,,gskrypka,,,[],,,,text,t2_1gngebz,False,False,"Now the question what should we do. I genuinely believe that to persuade people you should work with their believes rather than push your own.   


We should not expect that photos from massacres, information of atrocities made by Russian soldiers would persuade major part of Russian society. It goes against ideas from point 1 and 6. It is much more easier for them to believe that we are bad (""point 3 and 4"") than admit those atrocities, esp. in situation of war.   


Moreover I dare say that sanctions, collective Wester actions (like when UN members have left room during Russian speech) as well as arguments ""all civilised world is against you"" are not that effective as an argument. I think they make most Russians angry and are used as proof for point 2. Sanctions will show substantial effect only in few month :(   


Most of our argument work for people who are already on our side or close to it, people who do not believe propaganda. There are a lot of such people in Russia but we do not hear anything from them because of very restrictive law (generally speaking if you say in Russia that Russian soldiers have made atrocities in Bucha you might be put in prison for 15 years for spreading misleading information""). Interesting fact is that there numerous occurrences of vandalism against people who put ""Z"" on their cars, so we see silent protest of some part of society.  


But what about others. We should talk with them not about ""You government and military are doing bad things to Ukrainian"", no about Ukraine. We should talk about them. We should talk to them that this war is bad for them, that they will very soon have problems with jobs, that now they are not taken into army but in the nearest future could be, that their government is using them, that sanctions are only temporary and if they stop the war sanctions might be stoped.   
Secondly -&gt; we can should work with their believes by educating them, showing that the world is not  black or white, sharing our knowledge and experience, but only in a good faith.

1508,[],False,,gskrypka,,,[],,,,text,t2_1gngebz,False,False,"I think there are multiple factors that play out (I'm showing Russians point of views. It has nothing in common with my views. My goal is just to show their perspective so we better understand what is happening in their heads and we can more effectively in addressing it.)  


1. Russians believe they are force of good. This is something similar to America exceptionalism. This is reinforced by the cult of WWII and a story of nation that defeated nazis. They downplay atrocities made by Tsar Rule and Communists (both in public communication and history lessons) and show some pragmatic reasons for those actions (like they invaded Poland in 1939 because Poland already lost, because they need extra territories to fight nazis and actually USSR just got back territories it had lost during Polish-Bolshevik war).   

2. Russians believe that they fight against West. Many people believe West (esp. USA) is evil. This is true for younger generation as well. There are few arguments:  
\- History. Ex. Iraq. Let's say Iraq is pretty easy to use as USA falsely claimed that Sadam Hussein possessed weapon of mass destruction. They also believe that USA and NATO have destroyed Yugoslavia (I won't wright anything about it because I know very little on that topic).   
\- NATO expansion. NATO expanded during last 30 years and came closer to Russian borders.  
\- Revolutions in Ukraine (both Orange and Maidan). Both protests were supported by West so in Russian media they are portrait as orchestrated by USA. Same goes for any uprising like in Belarus in 2020.  
\- Russia is mentioned in US National Defence Strategy. Russian use this fact to claim that USA identifies Russia as enemy. They ignore the fact that Russia is put in document because of actions in Ukraine (Crimea and Donbas).   
Take those facts and claims and it become very easy to say -&gt;  USA is getting closer to Russia borders because they want to break great Russia. Why? Because Russia is an opposition to USA world order and they want Russia's resources and they were always  aggressive. Of course Russia absolutely ignores the fact that one of the main factors of NATO **expansion to the East was actually fear of Eastern Europe countries of being invaded by Russians.** I'm living in Poland and Polish people are really afraid of that. Same thing is true for Baltic countries.  

3. Russians believe Ukraines is puppet state. Russian establishment for many years built idea that USA is a puppeteer of Ukraine. This is additional argument used by Russian media.   

4. Russians really believe there are neonazis in Ukraine. There are few arguments:  
\- There are military and civilian organisation that seems to pursue some neonazi / fascist idea. But they are in minority. What Russia is doing is taking this minority and extrapolating their views on the whole Ukrainian society.  
\- Remember, Nazis for Russian means something completely different than for the west.  For most Russians on emotional level Nazis are evil invaders from the past that brought destruction to Soviet Union and destroyed people in concentration camps. During history lessons there are much more focus put on atrocities against USSR rather than Holocaust. Russians understand Nazi ideology on very basic level. That is why contr argument -&gt; Zelensky is a jew is not working.  
\- Some parts of our Ukrainian history are questionable esp. OUN and UPA. From one aspect, those organisations have fought for Ukrainian independence, on the other hand they were cooperating with NAZIS, representedfasсist ideology and were involved in atrocities against Jews and Polish people.   
\- Moreover the popular ""Glory to Ukraine, glory to heroes"" were used by OUN and UPA at some point. So you see the logic -&gt; organization connected to Nazis has used the slogan, now Ukrainians use the slogan =&gt; Ukrainian are nazis. Of course Russians absolutely ignore that the slogan has appeared in different form much earlier and it has another meaning in the modern world.  
\- There is a problematic issue with Russian language. Many people in Eastern territories use Russian as their native. There was for many years an issue of making Russian language second state language or at least regional (like French in Canada). At some point the were an Act of making it regional but after the start of the war in 2014 there were made actions to limit usage of Russian and promote Ukrainian. Just before Zelensky election there was approved a Language Act. The main goal of an act was promoting Ukrainian language (which is pretty understandable as you want to search for any ways to сut connection with aggressive countries so it will be more difficult for them to build support).   
Russians usually use this Act as argument to prove that Russian language people are discriminated in Ukraine. These are false claims. Most of my friends in Ukraine have never faced any problems with Russian. I even read some main articles of the act and in reality it is all about promoting Ukrainian language.   

5. Russians actually believe that Ukrainian and Russians are either one nation or brother nations. Generally speaking Russians lack understanding of what nation actually is and what makes nation. From what I've heard from older generation there were really small distinctions between Ukrainians and Russian during USSR period. Most people were thinking of themselves as Soviet Union citizens (I say most but of course not all. National ideas were still pretty strong in Western Ukraine). During Perestroyka (late 80-s) and 90-s that have changed. Now we Ukrainians identify ourselves as separate nation, while Russians still believe in outdated views.  

6. Russian believe that they have one of the strongest armies in the world.  
This is reinforced by 9th May parade, general promotion of Army (there is actually a sport in Russia called tank biathlon) as well as history of great victories (esp. victory over Nazis and Napoleon France).  


Now combine those strong believes and you see that you can find arguments for literally everything. Here is example:  


Masacre in Bucha. ""It cannot be Russia military. Russia military is good (see point 1) and well organized (see point 6)"". Now add some ""seems to be true claims"" =&gt; ""Russia army left Bucha on 30th March and the photos of atrocities were published only on 3rd April"". And next add something about the bad guys ""If it not us then it was made by Nazis (point 4) orchestrated by evil west (point 2 and point 3)"".

So as you see Russian propaganda works very well inside Russia. They build propaganda on partly true facts and appropriate interpretations of those facts so they adres people's feelings and believes.",c7f3eeda1e3ae85a6a6739dc8ea4ebd92fdcedad,True,False,,,,,0,1649723152,,0,{},i4d4qf6,False,t3_u1d711,False,True,t3_u1d711,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u1d711/how_are_russians_so_brainwashed_its_actually/i4d4qf6/,1649723171,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649694352.0,

Human lifecycles are, on average, 76 and therefore have an unfortunate expiration date for leadership. 

This was inevitable and has finally begun. WWIII. 

The expansion of war between two or more states is the world's top risk to avoid, and they are doing everything to secure time as a resource. 

The idea is that you can siege a city and deprive its resources, but we must ask, deny who?

She is correct. The people of Russia are suffering, but so is Ukraine. Ukrainians are experiencing generations of trauma to come, all at the expense of one political nation's conquest of resources.

In turn, nations react to cut the Russians off to mitigate their finances so they can not have enough money to function although this is sadly not going to work. 

Putin has prepared for this for year's. It's obvious if you reflect on historical events of conquest. 

This was all part of his plan. 

He wanted the world to turn against him so that he could use his anti-western rhetoric to recruit more low income Russians. 

Of all this will only fuel Putin’s rhetoric to engage more people of Russia to recruit. 


The nations of the world isn',t fighting back and they won't. Not until the themselves needs to fight back. 

This is how how it happened 100 years ago and most likely how it may happen again. 

We all need to focus on leadership, collaboration, logistics, and science as civilization during these next 10 years. 

Were in it now and as Dr strange may say, its the end game.  

All you can do at this point is share through word of mouth, social media with reputable sources, donate responsibly if you can, and observe to be ready for what next. 

It’s a horrible situation that we as a human civilization need to unite our collective thinking into the basic principles that we are all human here together, with many feeling scared, lonely, and scarce. 

The world needs a leader right now and there is not one with strong enough weight to contend Putin. Therefore it most come from a unified force.  

We need more leadership. We need more leaders.  Be the change now. Be 1% better. Do it in honor of mom and dads picked from their homes and in honor of brothers and sisters starving and cold.

Welcome to the 21st century.  We are in an information war.  Social media platforms are a warspace where we battle for control of each other's minds.  Words are our weapons.  If you speak the truth in my zone of control, you will draw no fire from me.  Tell a lie in my zone and I will work you up.  

When I detect a troll spreading disinformation in my warspace, I attack them with my words, and they use theirs.  I know I can't change their mind, and they know they can't change mine, but we both know that we aren't talking to each other, **we are talking to all of you**.

If you fall for their lies, you may join their side.  If you accept my truths, you might join mine.  If I am routinely successful in exposing their lies, they will soon learn my name,  and start attacking me personally with insults and veiled threats.  They want to upset me and make me mad, so I will stop thinking critically and start reacting emotionally.

Anyone that word clouds my comment history will probably see a big giant ""FUCK COMPLETELY OFF"" right in the middle.  That's when I step away from the screen, take a short break, and consider my next words very carefully.

Every social media platform has its rules.  If I break even just one of those rules just one time, I risk a permanent ban on that platform.  If a troll gets me banned from an online platform, they just internet killed me.  I no longer occupy the warspace, and the troll has won.  They can now freely spread their lies without any pestering from the likes of me.

Encouraging self-harm, or making violent threats is a very efficient way to get yourself quickly and permanently ""killed"" in most virtual warspaces.  I am usually allowed to tell people to fuck off.  I am almost never allowed to tell people to kill themselves.  If the warspace does not permit insults, I can usually say ""Fuck off!"", but if I say ""Fuck off you piece of shit!""- BAN!  and I am internet dead.

I have been on Reddit for over 8 years.  I had never received a warning from Reddit Admins in all that time, until this war in Ukraine started.  Being a witness to war crimes is not easy.  Seeing them, and not completely losing my shit about it, very hard.

Be careful out there.  Stand your ground, but watch what you say.  Every subreddit has its own rules.  Be sure you read, understand and follow those rules very closely, so you do not get trolled into a ban.

Happy Hunting!

That pair are a stain on Irelands underpants, clearly on the payroll of bad actors.

The positive out of all of this is that Ireland will no longer treat the MEP position as one of a retirement for failed local politicians and its highly unlikely they will ever be reelected.

In the Russian discourse, nazi or fascist isn’t primarly an ideological thing. It serves to invoke a very living memory of an invader (from the western direction) who presents an existential threat to Russia.

Russia is home to plenty of ideological nazis and fascists. But this isn’t what the regime is preoccupied with. They are using a language within a discourse to invoke imagery from the Great Patriotic War, to invoke a sense of battle against an existential threat.

&gt;I'm a left-wing person who identifies as as democratic socialist, so I'm sure we see eye to eye on a number of other issues. However, I'm writing with respect to your recent speeches regarding the EU's response to Putin's war on the democratic state of Ukraine.  
After 6 weeks of war, it is clear that Putin has no intention of seeking a peaceful resolution to this conflict so your advocacy for a diplomatic solution is frankly absurd as this would require ceding territory to Russia.  
By saying things like ""the answer to war is peace"" you're effectively advocating for a loss of Ukrainian statehood with the country bowing down to the Kremlin.  
You claim that ""peace isn't delivered by the barrel of a gun"" but I think the hundreds of thousands of allied soldiers who died defending against another imperialist during WW2 would beg to differ? Based on your own logic, I assume you also think the allies should have laid down their arms and politely asked Hitler to stop invading?  
Sanctions alone are insufficient and won't stop Putin's war in the short term, but to publicly advocate a peaceful response to a brutal invasion (with indisputable evidence of war crimes occurring) is absolutely mind-blowing to me.  
I'm sure your opinion would be very different if bombs were raining down on Dublin!

  
This was Clare's response:   


&gt;Thanks for getting in touch and raising this important issue. Firstly, there is no doubt in saying that Russia is the aggressor in this situation, as I have made clear over the past number of weeks, however I am sure I am not the only person to believe that NATO expansion eastward has also had a role to play in the deterioration of stability in the region. Secondly, and from the general theme of your email, I would say that your anger at my opposition to voting against more sanctions is the reason for your email. I am opposed to sanctions since they will harm the ordinary citizens of Russia. If we want to cripple the Russian war machine we should do it consistently. Unfortunately the media in Ireland fail to report that to date, the EU has paid over 35 billion euros to Ukraine in energy payments. Meanwhile, we have sent Ukraine just 1 billion for money to arm themselves. Is this a fair fight? We give Putin 35 billion, but Zelensky only 1 billion? The EU is literally financing the killing of Ukrainians and I will not accept this. So, to answer you query, I am fully opposed to Russia s actions, but I do not think more sanctions are going to make a difference when we are still allowing Russia to make money off this brutal war.

The Ukraine war really started 8 years ago, when Putin took Crimea, which turned out to be an overwhelmingly popular move with the Russian public. They have consistently supported Russian military operations in the Donbass too. Putin remains very popular in Russia, so if foreign forces assassinated him, Russia could very well end up as an even *more* aggressive state.

As an analogy, think about the Iraq War in 2003. Nations all over the world saw it as a US war of aggression based on trumped up fantasies about WMDs. Many traditional US allies even refused to support it, leading to very negative reactions from the US public (see ""freedom fries""). 

But in the US, President GW Bush's approval ratings jumped up to 71% upon the start of the war, and after one month, 78% of the public supported the war. All of that was in a country that actually allowed some opposition media (though it was pretty muted at the time). 

Think about what Americans would have done if Iraqis or some homegrown opposition had eliminated Bush then. The US public would have been out for blood. Do we think Dick Cheney would have decided to pull things back and reassess? No. Things would *not* have gone well for either the US or Iraq. 

Now, imagine something similar in a country where every news outlet is equivalent to the ones that were the most vocal supporters of that war. That's what Russia is now. Dissent is deemed unpatriotic and therefore silenced. Nationalist authoritarians like Putin tend to be pretty popular in much of the world. It takes more than eliminating them to break the spell.

In the US, it took time for the country to sour on the Iraq War and move on. Four years after the invasion, about 60% of Americans regarded the war as a mistake and it even became an issue in the Democratic primary, because Hillary Clinton had supported the war while Barack Obama had voiced his opposition. By the time of the 2011 withdrawal, 78% of Americans supported that decision. Even if Russia loses and Putin is eventually out of power, it will take a while for the average Russians to change their view of this conflict, if they ever do.",0398e62fa3096d00e52bc68a893ae3b814b1c0e2,True,False,,,,,0,1649697232,,0,{},i4bfjnu,False,t3_u180aa,False,True,t3_u180aa,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u180aa/do_yall_think_that_if_someone_eliminated_putin/i4bfjnu/,1649697250,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649668432.0,

Ukraine trained for this type of warfare and executed it perfectly,but the price has been massive horrible for the civilian population, and destroyed infrastructure.

The new front and new tactics will be alot harder for ukraine to defend against since it changes face now with open fields and more typical russian doctrine war with shorter logistic chains to russia and not the urban warfare that gave ukraine an advantage.

Its not random russia sat down and re-planned it so they will force ukraine out in the open to fight on russias conditions.

the west needs to supply more heavy weaponry nobody knows if that will happen.

Putin might use chemical or nuclear weapons if he is faced with failure on the new front because he might face his own end,if that happens nobody is really sure how it ends,it could turn into ww3.

That said ukraine is fighting as one,nobody is lied to nobody is forced,they fight for each other and their future,because they know the torture rape and death wouldn't stop if putin takes ukraine.

And that is really only how they can win,that is how they win,a future based on democracy with open trade a modern future with freedom to become what you want without fearing being dragged to a gulag or prison or be killed or raped for what you say or think.

To win is to be able to build that future that they want,not what putin want.

And until that happens they can only win battles until the war is over.

I think ukraine can win this because russia is rotted out from the inside and the pressure of war apply to both sides not just the attacked party,the west is trying to even the battlefield as much as it can and its very possible putins world falls apart because its not held together by anything then greed and fear.",873f1920e41e951751749efb94bf2af4f58b4a26,True,False,,,,,0,1649695190,,0,{},i4ba3jc,False,t3_u1b79d,False,True,t3_u1b79d,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u1b79d/current_war_standings/i4ba3jc/,1649695204,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649666390.0,

Further, the polls in Russia are just as reliable as the election results.  When they are faking all the news and making up numbers, the only reliable resource you can see is the number of people being arrested for protesting.  Lets not discount the fact that even hinting that you are against the 'special military operation' in Russia, will get you in jail, and marked as a traitor for life. 

There are over 3 million Russians in the USA.  Lets ask them.  They have significant influence on their families in Russia.

Germany, Italy and Japan were controlled by fascists.   They are all allies now.  It just takes a bit of freedom and democracy. 

The vast majority of Russians are normal, good people.  Lets hope and pray that these people find the combined resources to throw off their dictators and oligarchs, and integrate with the free nations.  That is what they want.  I've seen it first-hand.

War criminals will, of course, need to be tracked down, tried and punished.  To do that, Ukraine needs to win, and capture as POWs the remaining forces.   The world absolutely must do everything possible to make sure that Ukraine prevails.  It is critical to the future of the entire world. 

Pootin will be gone, one way or another.  Lucky for us, he has isolated himself and does not have any apparent strongmen confidants, heirs or hardliners.  He had crushed and threatened everyone around him.  You can see in the pre-war conference, the heads hanging and fear.  Now, its likely there is a whole lot more fear and hiding, given the humiliation Pootin is bearing.  He will be killing them off to deflect blame.  But, he cant kill too many of them, as they will outright revolt.  He just needs to keep them passively terrified. 

It would be better for Pootin to stay in power while the truth spreads, the sanctions collapse the economy, and the general  population starts to understand how their hero made them into starving prisoners.  We dont want a transfer of power into another strongman while the propaganda curtain is up.   They need to feel and understand the full force of rejection by the (free) world.  Then, when Pootin is out, sanctions are lifted, and their freedoms restored, we will likely see a phenomenal transformation. 

So.  Dont try to assassin8 Pootin (unless its an inside job, and not by the generals - what's left of them).",706133a0b711d765bd06a46619e58fb61edd70dc,True,False,,,,,0,1649694388,,0,{},i4b7zn6,False,t3_u180aa,False,True,t1_i4alxyk,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u180aa/do_yall_think_that_if_someone_eliminated_putin/i4b7zn6/,1649694402,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649665588.0,

“Unsuspecting civilians were killed carrying out the simplest of daily activities. A retired teacher known as Auntie Lyuda, short for Lyudmyla, was shot midmorning on March 5 as she opened her front door on a small side street. Her body lay twisted, half inside the door, more than a month later.”

“Auntie Lyuda was shot outside her front door.
Her younger sister Nina, who was mentally disabled and lived with her, was dead on the kitchen floor. It was not clear how she died.”

“They took the territory and were shooting so no one would approach,” a neighbor, Serhiy, said. “Why would you kill a grandma?”

Here is the crux of the matter.
