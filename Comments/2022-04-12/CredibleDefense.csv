In WW1 they were most enthusiastically used by Germany. Germany lost. They were used by Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Iraq lost. In neither case was use of chemical weapons ever a decisive factor. In both cases, adversaries adapted and started using chemical protective gear.

The only times chemical weapons have had the sort of dramatic battlefield effect that people think they do is when used against pre-industrial armies: by Spain against Moroccan insurgents in the Rif War between 1924 and 1927, and by Italy against Ethiopia between 1935 and 1939. 

The main problem is that every chemical weapon is neutralized by a gas mask, or by a chemical suit for chemicals that are toxic on skin contact. Chemical gear is cheap and ubiquitous. Meanwhile, to my knowledge nobody has yet made a shrapnel mask that neutralizes the effects of ordinary artillery.

They're really only useful for terrorizing civilians. And even then, they aren't *that* useful when used in a sustained fashion, because civilians can wear gas masks too.

As a layman/civilian, I'm struggling to wrap my head around the implications of Russia potentially using chemical weapons in Mariupol - it seems to me that we're now on a course where some form of Russia-NATO conflict becomes very difficult to avoid.

Until last night, I was willing to believe the plausible and level-headed analysis arguing that Russia wouldn't use chemical weapons in Ukraine because they're unlikely to be effective against military targets.

But if we assume that Russia did use a chemical weapon in Mariupol last night, it would mean that Putin has taken the fundamental decision that chemical weapons are ultimately worth using. And that suggests Russia will use them again, perhaps if they find themselves struggling to break entrenched Ukrainian defensive positions in Donbas, and perhaps if they are under political pressure to make progress. Dvornikov's time in Syria may also lead him to feel that chemical weapons can play a useful role in breaking defensive quagmires. 

It's hard to imagine that Russia would use chemical weapons just once and so ineffectively. It's more plausible that the first use in Mariupol would be either a test, a pilot scheme, or a semi-deniable way of eroding any red lines around chemical weapons, to desensitise Western reaction before larger scale use elsewhere in Donbas. 

I guess what I'm saying is that it feels like Russia may be moving towards Syria-style tactics, using chemical weapons more directly against entrenched positions, gambling that NATO will not intervene. I'm struggling to envisage Russia entirely refraining from the use of chemical weapons (assuming that they used them last night), and I'm struggling to envisage how NATO will react if/when chemical weapons are clearly in use.",8ad405308c8bd1bc0ddabc6dd38df7fd094862ae,True,False,,,,,0,1649804712,,0,{},i4hrfof,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t3_u1xdzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4hrfof/,1649804724,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649775912.0,

Is it so strange to think that Europeans are going to be more invested in what's happening on their own doorstep as opposed to what's going on in a faraway country?

I mean they're already having to house and support millions of refugees just a month into this conflict, something that took the Syrian War years to build up to. 

I think the West is also invested in this conflict because it's pretty black and white: Ukraine wants to break away from centuries of Russian domination and pursue greater democratization and Westernization and authoritarian Russia wants to impose its will on a country they see as being part of their own sphere of influence (property).

I think the fighting in the Donbas will be brutal and will be extremely costly on both sides. The terrain likely benefits Russia more (mostly open ground compared with the forests in Northern Ukraine) and a big set piece battle likely plays more to Russia's strengths. If they can mass enough fires and put together an armored fist capable of punching through Ukrainian lines they have a chance at a major victory. But the Russians are still plagued with morale issues, supply problems, and poorly maintained equipment. Most of their best units have already taken major losses in the war and are likely less combat effective than they were 6 weeks ago. 

For Ukraine's part, they've had 8 years to fortify this region and prepare for exactly this kind of fight. Their forces have high morale and momentum on their side. Because of the rasputitsa, it's unlikely Russia will be able to bring the full force of their armored vehicles against Ukrainian lines, making them easier to disrupt and attack. There are also a lot of questions about Ukrainian forces though, like how many casualties have they suffered, how much equipment/supplies do they have available, what the status of their air defenses/air force is, etc. 

I think the next 6 weeks will be absolutely critical to the resolution of the conflict. If Russia wins a major victory, they may expand their war goals again. If they win a costly victory they may try to go to end their campaign with the conquest of Southern Ukraine and the Donbas. Of the other hand, if Ukraine is able to prevent a major defeat and keep their forces in tact they could conceivably try to turn the tables and launch counterattacks to regain lost territory, including potentially even the whole Donbas.

I'd argue that they're better off making their own, or buying Indian or Japanese or something, or preferably from everyone they can, because they've been cut off from suppliers in the past.

The other factor is that if China attacks, production will probably be halted or at least slowed down. If they can't produce their own anymore and the US won't supply them with Tomahawks, then Bhramos is probably their best option.

India has hundreds of them in stock, they'd probably be more than happy to sell them off to Taiwan and replace their reserves with new batches, doing with Taiwan what China does with Pakistan.

Basis of this question comes from this twitter thread:  
  
https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1513318592334475265  
  
Basically, a common issue raised with equipping Ukraine with more advanced or complex western weapons systems such as F-16 or the Abrams is that not only would you need to train the operators/trigger-pullers but also the numerous support personnel needed to maintain the systems, as well as the long logistics train. Here is another thread that goes into a decent amount of detail about the logistical/maintainer issues:  
  
https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1510341587485745162  
  
When it comes to things like fuel supply and motor pool operations, a lot of these operations are already handled by contractors in western militaries through programs like [LOGCAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOGCAP).  
  
Considering Ukraine has claimed it could train it's pilots on an F-16 within [2-3 weeks](https://twitter.com/KpsZSU/status/1509619197290156032?s=20&amp;t=YXAohTpk0ZtbZl8i3khviQ). would it be possible to bring in civilian contractors to run/train maintenance and logistics for these planes to fill in capability gaps, to enable Ukraine to effectively operate these systems, at least until they recruit and train their own corps of maintainers.  
  
The [Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3522) which just passed the U.S. Senate, would appear to remove any barriers to supplying Ukraine with these more complex systems, as well as the steady stream of tools and spare parts needed to keep them running, leaving only the personnel missing. I imagine there is a decent sized group of people previously trained in maintaining these systems by western militaries, who would happily accept the six-figure paycheck, to sit on a base in Lviv and work on F-16 airframes.

It look like the sanctions were meant to be a deterrent to invasion but, obviously, deterrence failed - now what? We're left with punishment to maintain credibility. But where do we go from there?Western powers basically have two options so far as I see it:   


1. **Implement Sanctions to Remove.** Basically provide a path for sanctions relief or escalation based on conditions on the ground in Ukraine. Sanctions could be partially relieved if Russia agrees to a return to Feb 23 lines for example. The benefit to this is that it provides a path for de-escalation, the obvious downside is that it retains Putin in power and fails to impose a serious cost on Russia. 
2. **Implement Sanctions to Degrade Capability.** This appears to be the current (unstated but hinted) strategy - basically keep sanctions on to limit and constrain Russia's ability to wage war and, hopefully, aim for regime change. The upside to this strategy is obvious (less money = less tanks eventually), but the downside is that it offers no meaningful way to compel any behaviour from the Kremlin. Biden's made it very clear that NATO is not going to put troops into Ukraine, so if the sanctions are already at an 8/10 in terms of severity (and there's some debate on *if* they are) then what does an incremental push to 9/10 or 10/10 offer in terms of compellance? 

This is becoming a real point of concern amongst many of my colleagues in the economics realm - what's going to be the long-run impacts of cutting off Russia from western markets? Does this incentivize a push for further Sino-Russian cooperation? What's going to happen in Central Asia where Russia plays such an important role? How will Russia be re-integrated into the global rules based order? Is that even possible? 

Lots of interesting questions, but right now it's far too soon to tell. One hilarious side note is that the US may actually use frozen Russian cash to pay Russian bond holders while Russia defaults. So basically.. bondholders still get paid, they get paid with Russian cash, but we're still going to call it a default?

&gt;Bradshaw remains highly skeptical that Europe could respond so nimbly to a volte-face cutoff and warns that a worst-case scenario could land Europe where it found itself during the 1970s energy crisis: three-day production weeks, rolling blackouts, and energy rationing. Older people and those with low incomes would suffer disproportionately, he says. Germany is already feeling the pinch: automakers have periodically stopped production, gas prices have quadrupled, and industrial supply chains are being interrupted—and that’s with petroleum products flowing as freely as ever.

It seems the situation is not so cut and dry as you would suggest.

People are generally pretty good at dealing gradual change. We can rebuild our infrastructure to suit a new problem. I'd honestly say that the biggest problems we deal with today are political, not technical in that aspect. 

So the way I see it, a nuclear exchange happens over the course of a few days to a week. And then it's all over. People emerge from whatever holes they are and start looking to satisfy their needs. Many die due to exposure to radiation. Many do not. 

People become desperate and start fighting each other for things. At that point, people are trying to figure out how to survive in the new world. Some people are smart and figure out how to supply the things that people need, and they get their needs met better than anybody. They get more resources and become the leaders of the new society, and the leaders start attracting people do to other things to meet more needs of society, building more power.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"&gt; You don't need to destroy every single power station or chemical plant to wreak absolute havok on infrastructure, and to degrade its ability to sustain any level of urbanization. The modern world is extremely interdependent, and we're talking enough warheads to take out a lot of industrial capacity.

What do you have to destroy to take out electricity in the world? In a sense that it couldn't be back up? What would nuclear weapons hit that can't be repaired? Why would they prioritize that target?

&gt; Moreover, you don't need to destroy centralized production facilities to destroy capacity. You simply need to destroy transmission lines, pipelines, railroads and bridges to render even the most untouched central production facility effectively useless in the medium term. Mangle enough land at the kind of scale that nuclear weapons can mangle it and you will effectively cut off most urbanized areas from most utilities.

Transmission lines are quite difficult to destroy as they are not spread out over a large area. Sure, you can destroy specific points, but what is to stop us from building new ones or repairing the damage?

&gt; Mangle enough land at the kind of scale that nuclear weapons can mangle it and you will effectively cut off most urbanized areas from most utilities.

So people move to the country to work on farms? Seems like a pretty reasonable solution. At least until infrastructure is back up and running, and then people move to maintain the infrastructure.

&gt; I think you're severely underestimating the fragility of the integration between all of the systems that sustain the modern industrialize west's way of life.

I personally think most people severely underestimate the resilience of such systems. Do you know that something like 80% of electricity is used for HVAC? That means we can run most of the critical electricity needs in the world by just shutting off 80%. Sure, people will suffer and many will die due to heat exhaustion. Is it better to die of heat exhaustion or starvation? I think a lot of people would go without AC in order to make sure their freezer is working, or the freezer at the grocery store was working. 

And I'm not talking about this as some high minded fuzzy brain stuff. The majority of the world lives this way, struggling. 2nd and 3rd world countries. And they survive, and are arguably thriving right now. And they create societies that may not be what you like, but are safe in their own way. Safe in that they are predictable. 

Remember, people only need four things to survive. Food, water, warmth, and safety. People are quite ingenious in figuring that out. And all 4 of those things can be provided in many many different ways at industrial scale. Either centralized or decentralized. The challenge is that the nukes would be a shock to the system, so the first couple of months would be a major transition. After the first couple of months, things start to get back to ""normal"" in that people figure out their 4 major needs. 

Now you mention economic and industrial targets. Lets be real, if Russia focuses on industrial targets rather than urban centers, that would be a godsend. That means that most people would survive the initial salvo. And our most precious infrastructure is our people, not the buildings or grid or roads. People. 

Another aspect, even if Russia is able to target the USA with 1000 800kt nuclear weapons, there will be A LOT of survivors. Mostly rural. Life would suck for them for a while, but they will survive. And most of the long term damage (aside from the destroyed urban centers), would be the fallout. Which would be mostly gone after a year or two.

UKRAINE WAR
- Russia will not sue for peace (unless Ukraine/West gives them a victory), since a perpetual war is now tool for domestic repression
- There will be no meaningful push out of parts of Ukraine Russia is holding currently. In fact, some indefensible regions may be given up.  There will be fortification and entrenchment so that Ukraine cannot attack without heavy losses.
- There will be stand-off attacks to damage and punish Ukrainian cities
- Some probing raids to inflict damage to Ukraine and to generate positive PR ‘fighting the good fight’
- Ukrainian regions under Russian occupation will have their population either submit to Russian repression or be moved to Siberia

FOREIGN POLICY
- Closed borders to stop flow of information both in and out
- Long term misinformation campaign to fracture politics in the West and instill Russian sympathy into Western dissidents
- Election manipulation in the West to vote in leaders who would be open to lift sanctions against Russia. 
- strengthen ties with countries which will help Russia bypass sanctions
- Large effort towards stealing technology and industrial secrets

DOMESTIC POLICIES
- Totalitarian control over all aspects of life: no freedom, no travel, oppressive surveillance regime, swift segregation of dissidents
- Heavy indoctrination campaigns to commit population to support fight against external enemies 
- Nationalized command economy
- Rule by edicts (we may even see forced child births to address demographic collapse)

First, the article is total bullshit. Google the supposed writer's name and there is no journalist by that name. Google the paper ""The Times"" and look for this article in it and its not there. Its fake. Which means the entire premise of this supposed FSB scam is founded on fiction. 

Somebody took an unfounded rumor of the FSB 5th service chief getting arrested and others and crafted a fictional story to embellish it, without a single source. And it doesn't fly, because the fiction was terribly written. 

Second, were not talking about suckering reddit idiots with a fund raising scam, we're talking about the FSB 5th Service scamming the FSB and Putin in particular by stealing billions, telling hundreds that they're going to steal it all even though there is zero reason to tell them, and then paying them all, and then nobody talking about it until after it happens. Which is ludicrous. 

The FSB is an intelligence agency designed to keep secrets. Their 5th Service chief  is a colonel general, a career spook, he knows full how to keep secrets. There would be absolutely no need to include everyone, nor a need to give out bundles of cash when a small piece of paper with a numbered account with bank name can be handed over to someone as payment, for that individual to confirm on their own (which is how pros do it).  

This is just a bad story. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;which I would think is enough to buy off a few mayors or regional governor

So you think a few mayors and governors are going to prevent the Ukraine govt from resisting a Russian invasion? Stop the UAF from resisting? How about senior level federal govt officials working with Zelenskyy? How about the Ukraine intelligence apparatus? How about generals and colonels? How about media personalities who will give their opinions to influence group think? How about those who control infrastructure? Nobody gives a fuck about mayors or governors, they don't matter in defending Ukraine. To make this work involves bribing enough of the power elite of Ukraine to basically launch a coup against Zelenskyy and all who are loyal to him while Russia is invading, making sure orders for troop movements aren't given, etc. 

Occam's Razor is that Beseda and others were arrested (if even true) because they lied to Putin and told him that the Ukrainians wouldn't fight. Or else Putin is just using them as scapegoats because he is the one who decided the Ukrainians wouldn't fight; the easiest scapegoats are those in the intelligence apparatus who he can simply claim gave him bad info. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but it ties together nicely with Russia's expectation of the war going the same way it entered separatist territories with the opposition laying down its arms 

The USSR/Russia Federation invaded the following countries following the exact same premise as Ukraine 2022, armored columns rolling in as if on parade wiht nobody expecting much resistance, if at all: 

Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, Chechnya 1994, Georgia 2008, and Crimea 2014. 

AFAIK, none of those relied on KBG/FSB payoffs to prevent resistance, the civilian and military senior leadership  of the USSR/RuF looked at the intelligence estimations and just decided ""they wont resist.""

I have. A lot. It's a fantastic tool, and /u/restricteddata deserves a *lot* of praise for putting it together. But it does give a myopic view: the impact of *one* blast on *one* place, usually an urban core.

&gt; Question, how are the water mains destroyed? How are the power plants destroyed?

They're targets. ""Economic"" or ""industrial"" targets they're called in war plans. They're literally next down the list after counterforce targets, before city centers or ""strategic"" targets. In a general nuclear exchange, city-dwellers like me would most likely see the flashes and mushroom clouds from these several minutes or hours before being hit ourselves, in addition to any military targets that would be hit in the first salvo.

It's the final rung on the escalation ladder before murder-suicide of large population centers.

&gt; Well, it turns out that water supplies, sanitation, and electricity generation is typically done outside the city. Usually 10-20 miles away (or much further) from the city center. They'll get minor to no damage at all from a nuclear blast. 

You don't need to destroy every single power station or chemical plant to wreak absolute havok on infrastructure, and to degrade its ability to sustain any level of urbanization. The modern world is *extremely* interdependent, and we're talking enough warheads to take out a *lot* of industrial capacity.

Moreover, you don't need to destroy centralized production facilities to destroy capacity. You simply need to destroy transmission lines, pipelines, railroads and bridges to render even the most untouched central production facility effectively useless in the medium term. Mangle enough land at the kind of scale that nuclear weapons can mangle it and you will effectively cut off most urbanized areas from most utilities.

I think you're severely underestimating the fragility of the integration between all of the systems that sustain the modern industrialize west's way of life.",c36bc35641498650ddabc32de73ada2bbeb4aa9c,True,False,,,,,0,1649785753,,0,{},i4gg6xm,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t1_i4gdheq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4gg6xm/,1649785770,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649756953.0,

Question, how are the water mains destroyed? How are the power plants destroyed?

So the assumption is that most of the nuclear weapons will be concentrated on city centers. That's because they'll likely focus their weapons on attacking the people rather than the infrastructure. 

Well, it turns out that water supplies, sanitation, and electricity generation is typically done outside the city. Usually 10-20 miles away (or much further) from the city center. They'll get minor to no damage at all from a nuclear blast. 

It's the same for oil production, coal production, natural gas production, and refineries.

Now lets say they did decide to go after infrastructure. Refineries would probably be the easiest infrastructure to go after, but it turns out there are about 100+ refineries in the USA. So it would be quite difficult with ~200 nukes to hit them all. Many will survive. And we could import refined fuels from Mexico or Canada. 

And, it turns out that now there are probably 6 million electric vehicles in the USA. So even if they destroyed all refining infrastructure, it's very likely that a good portion of electricity infrastructure would survive and we could rely on the a few million electric vehicles to help deliver needed supplies until refineries are back up and running.

Imagine the resulting starvation, disease, lawlessness, the breakdown of social order, and how these consequences compound on each other.

Nobody is going to use a nuke because if they do then everyone else freaks out and launches their own. Why wouldn't they? 

If Russia has the balls to actually use the ""ultimate weapon"" in Ukraine it means they lost all senses. Even if Biden starts to balk his military advisors are going to recommend a full strike to kill Putin before he can escalate and launch on NATO. At that point either we fully commit and nuke Russia or Biden capitulates and deescalates, at which point Putin won. 

By using nukes and winning and getting away with it, more nukes start getting used elsewhere. Overnight a bunch of countries who have disassembled weapons become nuclear powers, like Saudi Arabia and Japan. At a minimum, Iran is nuked by both Saudi Arabia and Israel, and likely India or Pakistan nuke the other. 

To prevent that, the US would have to nuke Russia to show they can't use nukes without retaliation. And if that happens, Russia nukes CONUS with it's strategic arsenal, to include EMP, tsunami nukes, radioactive fallout ramjets, etc. And if that happens, China and NK launch too, to finish off the US because why not? The logical choice is to nuke the US too especially if it looks like we committed most of our strategic arsenal 

But we know this, all this shit has been game planned for half a century and we got out of the last nuke treaty so we could build more nukes. And we have the triad and VERY accurate nukes always on standby. So ours will get in the air and hit them probably before theirs hit ours. So Russia is basically destroyed and likely China and North Korea and anyone else who even looks like they're going to get frisky. Either that or we immediately surrender to avoid it. 

Freaking out yet? Wondering WTF the point to all this is? Wondering less about survival and more hoping you die quickly? Those are all the proper responses. And that's why Russia won't use nukes in Ukraine unless Putin legitimately goes nuts and decides to literally commit suicide (he will NOT survive WW3, the US will make sure of that).",18e1807573c4e9c3484d50905909e54e82093164,True,False,,,,,0,1649782067,,0,{},i4g68n5,False,t3_u1pikw,False,True,t1_i4f8brj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1pikw/there_is_no_reasonable_way_for_this_to_end_bill/i4g68n5/,1649782085,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649753267.0,

What do we know about background and social position of #Russian soldiers, who are deployed in #Ukraine? BBC analysed publicly available info about 1083 Russian servicemen, who were killed in action. Here are some tendencies were found out. Thread 
Regions that reported the highest number of the losses are so called depressed or semi depressed, ie areas with high unemployment and a low standard of living. In Dagestan (93 reported deaths) or Buryatia (53 rep. deaths) it’s very hard to find a job (let alone well paid job) 
In #Dagestan unemployment rate is 15% (compared to average 4% in #Russia), average salary - 400 USD. If one joins army as private they can around 500 USD, but army also provide them food, uniform and a place to live. So a bigger part of the salary remains in your pocket 
During “special operations” salary of a private infantryman of Russian army can reach 2.200 USD because of bonuses. Or even 2.600 USD if you are a sergeant or corporal. This is huge money for those living in the regions 
20% of officially confirmed losses come from 10 Russia's depressed regions (plus Dagestan). If we add numbers from semi-depressed regions - it will be roughly 80% of all losses reported by Russian official sources (ie local officials, media and schools).
Image
Striking example - there are zero(!) reports about military casualties from Moscow. Even Ukrainian sources never mentioned anyone from Moscow city, who was captured or killed in Ukraine. 
It can have 2 explanations: 1) there are very few military units in Moscow itself 2) people from the capital don't join military that often. But people from Russian regions do. Many males from small towns and villages see army as the only social lift available 
Russian army is an important employer for people from places where it is almost impossible to earn money. ""Joining the army gives them a stable salary and sense security"" - experts told BBC. 
This is Mikhail Garmaev from Siberia. He finished school,went to college, dropped out, joined the army (as a conscript).Then returned home, got a job(installing alarm systems).But soon he returned to army (becoming a prof soldier. On March 6 he was killed near Kiev. Typical story
Image
And there are many similar stories if you read biographies of Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine (especially non-officers). Young males in Russian regions study, then try and fail to find a stable job that will allow them to provide for their families. What is left? the Army 
Coffins with Russian soldiers KIA in #Ukraine started coming to other countries of the former USSR. We know at least about 2 funerals in #Kyrgyzstan, 2 in #Tajikistan and 1 in breakaway region of South Ossetia (part of Georgia controlled by Russia since 2008) 
All of them were technically citizens of Russia, who joined the Army. Egemberdi Dorboev lived in Siberia with his mother. He joined the Army in November. 4 months later he was deployed to Ukraine and killed in action
Image
In early 2000s people from some post-Soviet countries aspired to join the Russian army, because it was a quick way to obtain Russian citizenship. Now there is no such path officially. But some loopholes remain. And again army is almost only social lift accessible for them 
""Those migrants who didn't get good education and didn't find a better job in Russia find army career quite attractive. And strong propaganda adds to it”- explains human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina. 
With all that in mind - some aspects of Russian soldiers' behaviour in Ukraine look not surprising at all.

Think the one factory that makes widget X would be destroyed, so widget X would no longer be produced. But widget X is likely not the linchpin of our society. 

It turns out that the majority of our logistical systems are distributed. Meaning that there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Energy, food, components, raw materials, etc. usually have many different sources. To take out a distributed system like that, you have to have a systemic vulnerability. An example, all corn is vulnerable to radiation fallout. Then all the corn is no longer usable. 

So systemic collapse like you describe isn't quite as likely as you'd expect. I'd expect the collapse to be very similar to historical collapses, which is there will be challenges obtaining specific products and food, but overall, the system is quite resilient. 

Some people think that the systematic collapse would be ""people just go crazy."" Quite frankly, there is no historical evidence for that happening. Instead, people actually become more community based during a collapse and actually have fewer mental health problems. Think of what is happening in Ukraine right now, the survivors are united under a common cause. People also take law enforcement into their own hands, and that's why you see looters tied to poles. 

Additionally, since we are not clear on the fallout risk on food production, there is definitely a chance that a lot of food could be unusable, which would result in famine.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;The US military industrial complex has already kicked into high gear.

The US defense industry has not kicked into high gear. No plants are running 24/7 shifts. Like Raytheon who makes Javelins:

""Lawmakers want the U.S. to make more missiles, but companies will wait until they have contracts before cranking up production."" 

Without locked in funding those factories can't pay their employees so they aren't ramping up production. The only thing that is happening at the moment is that storehouses filled with certain munitions are being emptied and given to Ukraine, as our own stockpiles diminish without being replaced.

Let alone sewing machine or car factories being converted to making military gear. Etc. That definitely isn't happening. Please don't compare what is happening now to WW2, it's nowhere alike. It's more like the Soviet Afghan War, where we gave only certain things and never enough to seriously strain our stores.

&gt;If this war extends to additional months, the Ukrainians will be provided weapons that will annihilate all remaining Russian and separatist forces in Ukraine.

That's not how war works unless you're talking about using nukes.

The US is trying to get Ukraine old COMBLOC equipment mostly from former COMBLOC countries in NATO. So more T72, BMP, etc in lieu of western equipment, which the Ukrainians don't know how to use, where there is no satisfactory way to train them in the middle of a war. There are no wunderwaffen that the Ukrainians get that allows them to do what you claim.

As they get more supplies they immediately ship them to the front to use them. Hopefully they're trying to build a strategic reserve too, as they're going to have to go on a massive counteroffensive to retake their lost ground in their country. But when they do, they won't be able to encircle or even really flank the Russians much at all, so it'll be frontal assault after frontal assault, to include in urban areas, with the Russians on the defensive. 

Yes, it would be nice if all Russian and Separatists were destroyed but that isn't in the cards, at best they push them back.

&gt;The Ukrainian plan has proven sound, but the dearth of military assistance in the lead-up to the conflict has cost them dearly. Russia attacked along multiple axes, with large, armored thrusts pushing south from Belarus, southwest from Belgorod, northwest from Rostov, and north from Crimea. When the war began, Ukraine could not safely reposition its forces beneath the enemy air threat. They only had enough anti-tank weapons to blunt one axis and chose to use these to defend Kyiv. Lacking a means to attack Russian artillery, they saw their cities turned to rubble. They succeeded in defending the capital but lost considerable ground in the south and east. If Ukraine can blunt the next offensive on the Donbas, it will need to reconstitute its forces for a protracted struggle.
&gt;
&gt;Because military assistance was stepped up so late, Western capitals have prioritized weapons that were immediately usable in blunting Russia’s advance. This aid was critical in preventing Kyiv’s capture. Now that Russia’s main effort has switched to the Donbas, however, Ukraine’s immediate requirements are changing, and their international allies are pledging to meet these requirements, sending T72 tanks, protected mobility, and a steady stream of anti-tank weapons, man-portable air-defense systems, and loitering munitions. But with the risk of Kyiv’s fall having passed, Ukraine’s allies have an opportunity to regain the initiative by providing military aid that requires a longer lead-time, and thereby preparing Ukraine for the threat beyond the coming offensive.
&gt;
&gt;The Ukrainians are bracing for an offensive northward from Mariupol and southward from around Kharkiv. They face a hard month of fighting. The Russian units now appreciate what they are up against and with fewer lines to supply they should be able to bring a greater concentration of air and artillery to bear. The aim will be to surround the Ukrainian troops in the Joint Forces Operating area in the Donbas. At the same time the Ukrainian forces are reasonably confident they can hold, though it will cost them. Ukrainian troops now have only one front against which they must concentrate, where they enjoy numerical parity with the Russian forces and have stationed many of their best troops. They should impose a grueling rate of attrition on their adversaries.",09b09c03cb6ec9688f21792ab6975a910acc850e,True,False,,,,,0,1649776886,,0,{},i4fsdrh,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t3_u1xdzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4fsdrh/,1649776901,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649748086.0,

My early conclusion is that if they attacked Ukraine, they would be able to hit it with around a hundred nukes. But doing so would deplete their stockpiles of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. After that, they wouldn't have many left over for western Europe and the USA. Most would be aircraft delivery or submarine delivery, both of which are extremely vulnerable to USA air and sea power. 

That would give Russia the capability to probably deploy about 100 nukes to both the USA and Europe. Probably 25% would be shot down and probably another 25% would fail/fizzle. That leaves about 50 in each. Each nuke would represent about 250k immediate fatalities and 250k later fatalities. So roughly 25 million people killed in each of Europe and the USA. That's a big number, but not nearly as bad as many people would think. First, it would be the end of Russia, as every major city would be destroyed. We're talking 1000-2000 nukes on Russia. Second, Putin would be killed. Third, Western civilization would win that war. 

Obviously, such a situation would be basically genocide. Genocide is just sad. And the US political situation would change drastically. Major Urban areas will be largely destroyed (LA, NYC, SFO, etc), which would have an immediate impact on urban development. Not to mention the difficulty of finding uncontaminated food...

From top to bottom the ""separatist regions"" like South Ossetia, DNR, LNR, Abkhazia e.t.c are run by Russian Military officers and FSB/ security services personnel.  


When the DNR/LNR ""separatists"" had the delusion of believing they actually ran their ""break away republics"" the Russian security services killed the leaders on by one. Early on it was Mozgovoy that was killed I still remember it, you can watch the vice news videos where he was being loudmouth calling shots making provocative statements like ""I will arrest any woman on the street"" and he released statements that basically criticised the whole conflict and the ""powers that be"" and he ended up gunned down in his car.  


Then next was ""Motorola"" one of the fighters in a famous DNR battalion, blown up by a thermobaric bomb.  


Then next was his close friend and war criminal ""Givi"" killed by a thermobaric bomb clearly planted by an inside job. Thermobaric bomb detonated in his office.  


then lastly was  Zakharchenko the leader of the DNR and he seemed to be shitting himself, he seemed to know they were clearing house if you read between the lines of his statements after Givi was killed. He was killed by a thermobaric bomb planted in a Cafe he went to.  


The whole reason all of these ""separatist republics"" exist is it's a way for the Russian military to annex land, not take  a permanent committed responsibility for paying for it's maintenance but be able to direct what happens there but also deny that they're a modern imperial power taking land and annexing territory.  


It's always the same manipulation, claim abuse of Russians, start handing out passports, send in agents to ignite violence and conflict, send in weapons and equipment.. Send in special forces but deny they're there.. In the case of Georgia send in ""peacekeepers"" but have them actively fight the Georgians, when Georgia made domestic decisions they didn't like, start shelling more, if they respond claim  aggression and send in full invasion.  


It's pure manipulation, a big sign when Russia intends to basically annex your territory is when they finally ""recognise it's independence"".

[],False,,Killfile,,,[],,,,text,t2_1wbc,False,False,"**6\. The Nuclear Taboo benefits nuclear weapons states.**  

The use of nuclear weapons would be Bad for pretty much everyone for all of the reasons you outlined.  No argument there. But we need to understand nuclear-weapons states in the context of the Tragedy of the Commons.  

Everyone shoulders the burden of the existence of nuclear weapons. A nuclear exchange would effectively end civilization; there's some probability that this will occur; in effect, this ""cost"" exists for everyone equally.  

But nuclear weapons states draw outsized benefits from having these weapons as Russia is currently demonstrating.

As long as the risk of nuclear war remains small, however, the difference between the benefits of having nuclear weapons and the expected-value of the cost is pretty big.  Thus, for many countries, having nuclear weapons seems like a good deal.

But if the risk of nuclear war goes up then the delta between that benefit and that cost shrinks.  In effect: the more likely nuclear war is, the less beneficial it is to actually have nuclear weapons.  

This seems counter-intuitive but there's an easy way to demonstrate it.  Let's imagine that, tomorrow, it was absolutely certain that the US and Russia would go to war.  Would either country be better off without nuclear weapons?  Obviously, yes... because even a very one-sided war with all of the consequences thereof is preferable to global annihilation. 

All of this is to say that Russia therefore has a vested interest in maintaining the nuclear taboo.  The relative advantage that its arsenal grants it is substantially due to the low likelihood that the weapons will ever be used.  The use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine would heighten nuclear tensions and erode the nuclear taboo, making future nuclear war more likely and diminishing the relative value of the Russian arsenal. 

Of course, all of the above is predicated upon the assumption that Russia acts rationally.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War

------------------

&gt; This simplification of the conflict ignores what may be one of the most successful applications of IPB in modern military history. Through extensive preparation, the Japanese Empire defined in detail the operational environment and its effects on operations, identified the threat, and analyzed how their foe would fight. This article will show how and early form of IPB seven as a sling that the Japanese David used against the Russian Goliath, shaping the course of both nations and the entire region during the 20th century . 

------------------

I thought that this quote reminded me of the lead up to the current war in Ukraine.

&gt; In a final note to Russia, Japan reiterates the importance of Korea to her own national security, high-lights the threat posed by Russia’s continued (illegal) occupation of Manchuria, and laments Russian recalcitrance in refusing to make any concessions or enter negotiations.

On the first point - support for Slovakia providing help to Ukraine is presumably very high amongst the Slovakian people, and so looking like you're actively trying to provide Ukraine with fighter jets is a good move for the Slovakian leadership, regardless of whether it ultimately happens or not. Ditto for Poland and their MiGs. It could also be an attempt to try and push larger NATO partners (mainly the US, or possibly the British/French/Germans jointly) into acquiescing and facilitating the MiG transfer. Support for supplying Ukraine is very high across the Western world right now, no leader wants to be seen as not doing enough - and so public discussion of the MiG transfer makes that the new standard for 'enough'. 

For the second point - the fighter jets in question are not especially capable in a way that would drastically change the war (compared to, say, a hypothetical transfer of 50-100 F-35s, or even latest block F-15s, Rafales, Typhoons, etc) - however, they are eye-catching. Fighter jets are definitely the *sexiest* item of military hardware, when it comes to public and media discussion. Making the MiG transfer the talking point distracts media that immediately thinks of Top Gun and impossibly fast dogfighting, whilst transfers of artillery, trucks, SAMs, and armoured vehicles (which Ukraine needs far more) can take place, somewhat under the radar.

Putin using chemical weapons should be a red line and the reason he hasn't used them up to this point is because he doesn't know what we'll do about it. That fear of a response keeps him back especially because Biden said that we'd respond significantly. 

But if Russia does a slow escalation of chemical warfare, he's already broken the red line and then there's no response from Biden. If Putin kills 5 people with gas, then 10, then 12, then 20, a slow escalation up the response would be significantly more limited I think, there's not the outrage necessary from only the deaths of a couple people and it will 'desensitize' the west.

If we say ""Oh my god this was a chemical attack and we're going....to be very very very very mad about it!"" Then Putin is just going to unleash fullscale chemical warfare because we've acknowledged the red line has been crossed, and we're not doing anything about it.

[],False,,Doglatine,,,[],,,,text,t2_a8hrp,False,False,"What are the primary factors restraining Russia from use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine? I’ve seen surprisingly little level-headed analysis of this question, with most commentators leaping straight to deterrence or to vague answers like reluctance to violate international norms. 

Neither is really satisfactory - it’s very questionable whether the risk of mutually assured destruction would be great enough to deter local use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine, given the very different global situation from the Cold War. Likewise, Russia has already shown itself willing to violate norms of the Liberal International Order (even the Westphalian system itself). Why would it have special scruples about nukes?

Being more precise and pragmatic about it, I think we can tease apart a few factors that would deter Russia from nuclear escalation —

**1.	 Internal political considerations.** Putin has gone to great lengths to avoid calling this a war, and defied many experts’ predictions in choosing not to mobilise or declare martial law. For him to use nuclear weapons now would be hard to square with the limited view of the conflict he’s been pushing internally.

**2. Humiliation/loss of prestige.** Putin is still intent, it seems to me, on showing domestic and international audiences that Russia can win this war in conventional terms, thereby salvaging its military reputation. This goal cannot be achieved if Russia is forced to use nuclear weapons to defeat ‘little Ukraine’ - rather than projecting strength, it would compound Russia’s humiliation.

**3. International outcry/loss of diplomatic support.** Countries like India, China, Brazil, and Indonesia have been relatively muted in their response to the invasion so far. However, use of nuclear weapons would attract outcry on a much larger scale. While China and India might not abandon Russia entirely, their support would be dramatically curtailed, while there would be a very negative reaction from most non-nuclear powers at the precedent Russia had set.

**4. The end of NPT.** If Russia used nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear power, it would all but kill the NPT; more countries would feel the need to develop nuclear weapons to safeguard their sovereignty. This would be inherently destabilising, but would also reduce Russia’s entrenched nuclear advantages.

**5. Western retaliation.** Of course, the West would be forced to retaliate. However, it’s not clear to me that this would take the form of direct military retaliation, let alone a nuclear response - the risk of a general nuclear war might simply be too high for Western governments to tolerate. More plausible would be a complete economic freeze of Russia with aggressive secondary sanctions, effectively telling every country in the world “choose us or Russia”.

I’d be interested to hear others’ suggestions so we can get a systematic list. A key point to note is that factors (1)-(4) apply much more strongly in the absence of direct NATO involvement. If NATO were to commit to a no-fly zone and start shooting down Russian planes, for example, the direct diplomatic repercussions on neutral parties of a Russian nuke on a NATO airbase would be less clearcut than they would be from using one against Ukraine (after all, Putin could portray it as desperate self-defence). Likewise, if NATO is directly at war with Russia, the situation would have escalated organically (voiding consideration 1) and Putin would no longer need to fear looking weak if he used nukes in response (everyone expected Russia to beat Ukraine using conventional weapons, but no-one really expects Russia to beat NATO conventionally).

All in all, I think an analysis of the factors currently limiting potential for nuclear war can help us understand what kinds of Western escalation are most risky, and I think they illustrate the importance of avoiding direct involvement, even if it may seem like an academic difference given the quantities of materiel being transferred. But I’d love to hear others’ thoughts.",88c1557998694a0dfada993ffd78cbe4001f42d1,True,False,,,,,0,1649767574,,0,{},i4f6adf,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t3_u1xdzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4f6adf/,1649767590,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649738774.0,

Ahh, the escalation dilemma.

I think the big risk is not so much that Russia will use nuclear weapons against NATO directly if a NFZ is imposed, but they may use them against Ukraine (or threaten their use against Ukraine) if NATO intervenes.

This is a much more difficult situation for NATO to deal with. NATO/the US will not be willing to invite Ukraine into a nuclear umbrella situation, nor can it guarantee via a NFZ that Ukraine will not be the victim of a nuclear strike. Russia has multiple ways of deploying these weapons at a sub-strategic level and there are plenty of targets in Ukraine that could be used to 'send a message'.

Russia can essentially hold Ukraine as a 'nuclear hostage' and threaten to escalate via various villages, towns and cities until NATO backs off. NATO will not want to risk an actual nuclear exchange with Russia.

Would it be just for NATO to intervene with an NFZ if Russia was threatening to kill 100,000 of Ukrainians with nuclear weapons? And if it did do this, the pressure on other countries to seek nuclear weapons will be massive. 

If Russia breaks the nuclear taboo under pressure from conventional NATO strikes on its forces in Ukraine (and likely air defence assets in Russia as well) the pressure for other countries to obtain nuclear weapons will be immense.

This is why I think it's too risky for NATO to engage directly in the conflict.",fda59df7b03ff4e26f0ba8a33c3ab6bb53e1b9b5,True,False,,,,,0,1649759801,,0,{},i4esv24,False,t3_u163bl,False,True,t1_i4epx0f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u163bl/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_11_2022/i4esv24/,1649759812,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649731001.0,

I believe Zelenskyy knows this is quite infeasible and exactly what it would entail, but (tiny chance) would end the war extremely quickly, or much more likely allow him to domestically sell the idea of giving up on joining NATO (+ ""it was never going to happen anyway"" etc.) but instead focus upon securing security guarantees from individual countries-- with the distinction between ""NATO"" and the countries hat make up NATO being very important to keep good ties with everyone as he navigates this.

I actually think this is a good strategy given Ukrainian polling on NATO (they overwhelmingly love it and want to join, especially now, and giving up potential membership will be unpopular), as well as being able to give Russia a ""win"" against NATO, but from where I'm at I genuinely can't see which countries could act as a good guarantor.

So, not in NATO, else it's effectively like having NATO membership/article 5 extended. Also not pro-Russian, or someone who does not have the willingness to actually stand up to Russia and fight them, but at the same time someone who has the capacity to do so. Very limited pool of options, there.

Would need a negotiated peace, likely along not too dissimilar demands to those that currently exist imo.

1. Russia has no *real* history of democracy. Whether right or wrong putin's view is that russia *needs* a strongman leader. I'd actually tend to agree with him. Either way though this means that in the short-medium term the system of government is going to remain largely the same as it is now.

2. With that in mind, the ability of any new administration to maintain public favour/control would rely heavily on either being able to project competence/ 'looking out for russian interests' or some sort of exceptionally intricate information campaign to shift public perceptions/expectation. The latter would be a longer term project.

3. I think people in the west seriously underestimate the role that the likes of crimea plays in the Russian psyche. The breakup of the USSR itself can kinda be described as a bunch of power grabs from various soviet officials (including yeltsin) where consideration wasn't given to how the new borders were drawn. From the moment ukraine 'declared independence' russians have never accepted the loss of crimea. Hell the russian parliament's decision to declare Sevastopol sovereign Russian territory was part of the prelude to Yeltsin sending the army to bombard the parliament before he himself engaged in yet another power grab. Crimea declared conditional independence by the kiev government in 1992, but was shut down, russian naval stationing at sevastopol has been a constant thorny issue between the two for decades (naval base for gas treaty) etc etc. Essentially it's an issue that's never going away, and the russian public overwhelmingly see crimea as russian. I don't see a peace treaty being accepted by russians where crimea doesn't remain part of Russia. It would be seen as 'ceding crimea all over again'.

Once you acknowledge the political realities of any new Russian leader I just don't see how there's room for any sort of meaningful concessions, especially beyond the territories from when the war started (I'd wager the desires for a land corridor to crimea are kinda necessary too). Maybe someone can think up a fancy new fudged agreement, but then again Minsk 2 was a fudged agreement and look how well that worked out?

Yes Russia can get controlere for washing machines and fridges and maybe some limited chips for cars but anything more complex than that falls under the regime of sanctioned imposed by the US and the EU.

The kind of chips that can be used in missiles, data processing centers or command and control units are not off the shelf consumer chips.

If they really choose to cross the line why bother the costs for less than a singular cruise missile can offer?

I'm not trying to say something didn't happen. But for such a small scale it could have been a rogue Russian, a finger pointing game, or frankly just an explosive going off next to some run of the mill industrial chemicals.

I know Russia holds far less taboo over chemical use, but seriously, why would they cross the line to affect a whole three people when any use could incur similar costs? 

Calling foul and blowing any international response load preemptively over the information currently available is questionable. What happens if weeks later it really happens at some scale? How much countermeasure potential may be given up over a big maybe around 3 people?

I’m aware they have a number of disadvantages for the theater ( high vertical profile, relatively difficult to drive, complicated logistics pipeline) however they are available, reasonably inexpensive and would fill an important niche in Ukrainian inventory.  Thoughts?

As someone who's been in a lot of MRAPs, they tend to be huge, high off the ground, loud, and noticeable.  Resistant to explosions coming from underneath, but cut to pieces by anything that uses a HEAT warhead and kiss your ass goodbye if you're hit by a real mortar or arty round. So the protection they're offered at the moment isn't conducive to the battlefield of Ukraine where you want to remain unseen, unnoticed, with good protection from indirect fire. IFVs which offer far better protection for the kind of explosives that Ukraine is facing and low profile vehicles are more beneficial at the moment to what Ukraine needs. MRAP's are great in IED rich environments where you already have military superiority and don't have to worry about heavy weapons.",fee8324159773d7cd9f9b77b1f43149347190f48,True,False,,,,,0,1649739246,,0,{},i4e1xo1,False,t3_u163bl,False,True,t1_i4c4y3l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u163bl/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_11_2022/i4e1xo1/,1649740265,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649710446.0,

The control systems for these ICBMs and for the UR-100N/RS-18A were designed at [NPO Electropribor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartron) in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and the RD-250 rocket engines were built at [Yuzhmash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhmash), also in Dnipro, Ukraine.

The idea that Ukraine ""never really had nuclear weapons"" is at best a recent revisionism to the historical record - Ukraine's declaration of independence was August 24th, 1991; and the Budapest Memorandum was in December 5th, 1994. In fact, as the operators of Europe's largest nuclear power plant with plentiful access to enriched uranium, designers of the control systems, and builders of the rockets and the engines necessary to deliver a nuclear strike anywhere in the world, the idea that they lacked the technical ability to reprogram the codes after three years is absolutely fiction. 

Russian R-36M2 ICBMs [were in fact maintained by those same Ukrainian companies](http://russianforces.org/blog/2008/01/russia_and_ukraine_will_mainta.shtml), with Putin having signed a maintenance agreement with Ukraine in 2006 in order to keep them in operational service long enough for the Russian-designed [Sarmat 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-28_Sarmat) to replace it - a product that ostensibly began design 2009 by [Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makeyev_Rocket_Design_Bureau) but that has slipped more delivery milestones for delivery than Jeff Bezos's starliner and has yet to deploy a single rocket. The next nearest competing delivery system, the Yuzhnoye [Dnepr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnepr_(rocket)) was scuttled in 2015 by Ukrainian authorities over the invasion of Crimea.


Failure by the Ukrainian government to secure the nuclear weapons built by Ukrainians or credible guarantees of protection from former President Clinton or President Yeltsin in the Budapest Memorandum is more a function of the then-nascent government's immaturity and lack of political will that it was of any real technical impediment.

There aren't really any serious commentators who make the claim that Ukraine's potential to become a nuclear weapons nation was not a genuine and technically feasible reality; but in the modern climate of political football over these topics, the issue has been pretty muddied.

Well no, the threat would obviously be ""keep your military out of our sovereign territory (Taiwan) or we will use nuclear weapons against your military and/or you"".  And the escalation chain would see strategic nuclear weapons used against American ships (deployed by torpedoes and/or ASBMs), followed by nuclear attacks on American overseas bases such as Okinawa. I think China could correctly assume that the US wouldn't launch a full-scale counterforce nuclear attack in response to either of those events and is more likely to back down than to escalate to potential MAD scenario.

I think we can both agree that NATO isn't particularly afraid of Russia's conventional military capability, so then why would such caution be shown to reduce the chance of escalation?

The truth is that a nuclear bluff from China keeping the West out of a China/Taiwan conflict would be vastly more effective than the Russian bluff has been for these reasons:

1. It would be a fully domestic war for China, where any foreign participation is an invasion of Chinese soil, drastically increasing the justification for nuclear weapon usage. Unlike Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China doesn't see Taiwan as 'unconquered territory' but as its own territory which is temporarily out of its control.

2. China has a much longer and more granular set of nuclear escalation options than Russia does, as strategic nuclear weapons can be used against US Naval forces without involving civilians

To say “China is the only threat we’ll ever face, so it’s worth it to isolate *ourselves* by causing a global depression to prevent them from invading one relatively small state” is a huge abundance of confidence that history has not justified.

Secondly, shipping companies need insurance. And insurance companies will simply refuse to insure ships going through war zone routes regardless of a blockade. Or raise insurance prices that it becomes unfeasible to insure. This would have knock on effects where companies simply self sanction similar to Western companies pulling out of Russia (there is no law requiring Western companies to pull out of Russia).

&gt;Some are simply quoting to cover at prices that they know will be refused. There was almost zero cost prior to the war.

&gt;It means that insurance now likely exceeds the cost of hiring the vessel itself. A $50 million, five-year old tanker hauling a standard 1 million-barrel Russian cargo would need $5 million just in insurance premiums -- about $1.5 million above the cost of hiring the carrier.

&gt;One of the people said that the pool of insurers still quoting has substantially dried up, meaning those who remain are demanding higher prices.

The documents do not identify the specific facility, but it is believed to be the US Air Base at RAF Lakenheath in southeast England approximately 100 kilometers northeast of London.  
.......  
The addition of the United Kingdom to the list of nuclear storage locations being upgraded in Europe signals a change in the nuclear status of RAF Lakenheath. It is unclear if nuclear weapons have been returned to the base yet or NATO is upgrading the base to be capable of receiving nuclear weapons in the future if necessary  
....  
Given NATO’s cautious nuclear response to Russia’s nuclear saber rattling at the start of its invasion of Ukraine, it would be odd if the nuclear upgrade at RAF Lakenheath reflected plans to deploy additional US nuclear bombs to Europe. FAS estimates there currently are roughly 100 nuclear bombs deployed at six air bases in five European countries.  
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg declared in December 2021, that “we have no plans of stationing any nuclear weapons in any other countries than we already have these nuclear weapons as part of our deterrence and that… have been there for many, many years.” Unless NATO has changed its plans since, that seems to be a clear signal that there are currently no plans to deploy nuclear weapons to RAF Lakenheath for now  
Rather, the upgrade at RAF Lakenheath could potentially be intended to increase the flexibility of the existing nuclear deployment within Europe, without increasing the number of weapons. Adding RAF Lakenheath as an active site would potentially allow it to receive nuclear weapons from other existing locations in Europe, if that became necessary. Such a contingency could potentially involve receiving weapons withdrawn from Turkey. There are unconfirmed rumors that many of the weapons at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey have already been withdrawn and moved to other bases in Europe.  
Readying RAF Lakenheath could potentially also be intended to better realign the overall nuclear posture in Europe with the rapidly deteriorating relations with Russia. This is a delicate issue because changes in NATO’s nuclear posture in Europe might trigger retaliatory changes in Russia’s nuclear posture, including potentially deployment of nuclear weapons to Belarus, which recently changed its constitution to allow for just that.",e78e9352a7b52b8eeca44d4971634cda1ce32468,True,False,,,,,0,1649729750,,0,{},i4djsjh,True,t3_u1o3vs,False,True,t3_u1o3vs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1o3vs/lakenheath_air_base_added_to_nuclear_weapons/i4djsjh/,1649729764,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649700950.0,

All wafer processing equipments require constant maintenance, as in after x number of wafers processed, they have to be put down for maintenance.  Some equipments (eg. photolithography step-n-scanner) can only be serviced by manufacturers’s engineers who are on site.  

Many equipments need constant replenishment of ‘consumables’ such as thin film deposition source materials, which need to be semiconductor grade with ‘five 9’ purity (that’s 99.999% pure).

The military industrial complex, think tanks, and National Security Council in Washington have all been shifting slowly to strategic clarity. The past Secretary of State Pompeo lifted senior diplomatic exchanges between Taiwan and the US the day before he left office.

Even Biden's most recent remarks on Taiwan says he does not support independence, which is used by Chinese state propaganda as an indicator that the US hasn't informally changed its stance yet. However they conveniently leave out the portion where he doesn't support independence because [""Biden says Taiwan's independence is up to Taiwan after discussing matter with Xi""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/biden-china-taiwan/index.html).

So you’re right, but there are also other substantial advantages to USD debt that someone planning on switching to yuan debt would have to deal with.",0ef0c1127fd5e2bc93d06c9edf6480016101c2ec,True,False,,,,,0,1649725355,,0,{},i4d9oio,False,t3_u163bl,False,False,t1_i4d2416,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u163bl/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_11_2022/i4d9oio/,1649725371,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649696555.0,

On paper, yes.  But considering how effective ""don't interfere or we'll nuke you"" has been for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, one can only assume that such a threat would be even more effective when used in the case of a Chinese invasion/blockade of Taiwan. China (and technically even Taiwan) would clearly consider this to be a conflict entirely within Chinese territory consisting of Chinese people fighting other Chinese people, and unlike hypothetical NATO forces engaging Russian forces in Ukraine, China would consider foreign forces participating in a China/Taiwan conflict to be invaders on their sovereign territory.
