And it's important that we provide more support to Ukraine by providing anti missile defense systems and planes but avoid direct conflict with Russia because ironically that would help Putin. 

Basically send no troops, but send way more support through planes and equipment to help Ukraine clear the sky's. 

My thoughts, this means Putin wants to put the U.S. in a situation where he can blame America for some serious act of war scaring the U.S. into thinking Putin might nuke us, giving Putin a lot of leverage at the bargaining table. If we're suddenly think he's on the ledge and might pull the nuclear trigger, Biden is going to do anything he can to avoid that. 

Frontline just aired a really good special on Putin Tues night about his rise to power and explaining why he's obsessed with Ukraine. It explains a lot, you can watch it on pbs.com or their streaming app or on YouTube 
https://youtu.be/MsfUiTJv2lE

Putin is master manipulator and liar, he spent years working directly under president Boris Yeltsin successfully pretending to support democracy. He convinced Yeltsin that he wanted to continue the progress of democracy in Russia and was appointed his prime minister then eventually got the presidency. Once Putin was in power he systematically deconstructed the democracy by manipulating the Russian people with propaganda and taking advantage of horrific events like the death of 100s of children that were held hostage by terrorists. But the children died because Putin ordered the Russian military to shell the school, it caught fire and hundreds of school children burned to death. 

He took advantage of that situation he basically orchestrated so he could pass a bunch of laws that allowed him to do a lot of undemocratic surveillance and arrests in Russia among other things I think.

He's fully willing to kill 1000s of innocent people if he thinks it will help him manipulate a situation. 

But now that so many people are aware of the way he operates the U.S. knows the playbook and has to tread very carefully to prevent him controlling the narrative and manipulating the situation as he's done so well in the past.",f204d8dff1c50816ed49f193978a08898b85b669,True,False,,,,,0,1647522900,,0,{},i10j9h2,False,t3_tfn2ld,False,True,t1_i0xdszu,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tfn2ld/the_mariupol_drama_theater_where_hundreds_of/i10j9h2/,1647522917,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647494100.0,

Watching videos from a distance, where there's no blood, no screaming, and it's impersonal - I honestly enjoy seeing the bad guys get their due.  In terms of justice, I enjoy it.  In terms of right and wrong, I enjoy it.  In terms of cheering for the underdog, I enjoy it.  

But from what I've seen, the majority of Russian soldiers don't want to be there.  They have no reason to be fighting, like the Ukrainians do.  There are those that walk away and surrender.  There are probably many more that would like to, but, who knows what's going on in Russia - if families of soldiers are being threatened if a soldier walks away.  I wouldn't be surprised if soldiers were made to perform at gun point.  They may have even seen comrades gunned down by their own commanders or arrested and shipped back to Russia.

In terms of the war crimes, there are always the crazies - especially if they're numbed by vodka or something else.  Regardless, I have no pity on them.  Then there are the pilots and artillery men (including those that launch missiles) who know their target only as a set of coordinates or a building on a map.  People forget that this isn't WW2 - most of these pilots who bomb locations in Ukraine are doing so from such a distance and altitude that they don't really know what they're bombing, other than what they see in their monochrome displays and on their radars.  Some obviously know what they're bombing, but pilots can't just surrender like soldiers.  They have to return to base and risk arrest or worse.

In short, I'm torn between enjoying seeing their tanks blown up and aircraft blown out of the sky, and pity for them being in a no-win position.  For those who knowingly kill civilians, I have no pity.  But for those who are just firing at coordinates on a map or whatever, for those who are following orders at gun point or under threat of harm to their families, it's more complicated, unfortunately.

Either way, war sucks.  Too many people die.  Too many young men.  Too many innocent civilians.

What I hope is that the more Russians die (and the more the sanctions hurt the economy), the more the Russian people will stop their support and - hopefully - rise against Putin and his fellow criminals.

Putin may be ready to sacrifice 100 thousands for a victory. But are the Russian people ready for it? They had been living in an economy that finally prospered. They could travel and study abroad. There were modern jobs popping up everywhere. And now that's gonna collapse. If we can somehow make them understand that stopping the war will be better for them...

Ukraine doesn't have much more to lose. The cities get bombed already, people are leaving the country or fighting. Their president managed the crisis like an actual hero so they are now ready to fight to the last man. While Ukraine looks devastated on the surface, I think it's much more stable politically now than Russia is. Ukrainians got a sense of unity.

Both will lose, especially lives. Ukraine could ""win"" if Russia experiences a coup and then withdraws its military and agrees to peace - they will have won greater unity, the attention and support of the western world. But they still would have lost many lives, infrastructure, homes.

Russia could ""win"" by exterminating Ukraine's military and politics. They would then occupy scorched earth. They would occupy a country with destroyed infrastructure, with many of its people in exile and not returning to the occupied country. Those who still live in Ukraine will keep disobeying their occupants. It will be a hell to manage, and cost Russia a lot of resources and personell in the long run. They will risk a civil war between pro-Russian and anti-Russian Ukrainians. And sanctions would still apply as long as Ukraine is occupied, spiraling Russian economy far down. Russia's ""winning"" scenario is suicide.

Russia would also win if they had a coup and replaced people in power with real democrats. But it would at the same time heavily destabilize the country for a while. Even if it means sanctions stop, they will struggle and risk infighting. They will be faced with an official war loss, they have to agree to bad conditions in a peace treaty and pay reparations from their already damaged economy. It would not feel like a win to everyone.

In despair knowing that they lose whatever they do Russia could launch an actual attack at another front, occupy Lithuania or something to stop western aid for Ukraine. That would be suicide as well, and cause even more death and devastation.

In the end nobody will win. Not even Nato countries, we will suffer the results of our own sanctions against Russia. And I'm all pro those sanctions. I'm ready for the financial hardships and I know my country is rich enough that I won't starve. But it will be a loss nevertheless.

Knowing that we will all lose anyway... it's time to focus on ending Putin's reign I'd say.",523c2ebb045e6b158691c48e8f8b3d906764e442,True,False,,,,,0,1647515025,,0,{},i105quy,False,t3_tg00lm,False,True,t1_i0zv9p9,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tg00lm/who_do_you_think_will_win_the_war_ukraine_or/i105quy/,1647515041,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647486225.0,

Imagine Putin has a stroke or something.  Russia is in confusion, military plans are put on hold.  Belarus keeps fighting, however.  Zelensky decides to knock Belarus out of the war, so Ukrainian tanks and infantry cross the border into Belarus.

They need to capture a village on a crossroads.  It's defended.  They use mortars and artillery.  Women and children get hurt.

They pass by a large town, and learn that there tanks waiting for them other side.  They fire artillery over the town, and some shells fall short.  A theater is hit, a hospital is hit, women and children die.

The attack on Belarus also turns out to be more difficult than planned.  More troops are poured in, more weapons are used, and less care is exercised because your comrades are being killed.

Would you then agree that these Ukrainian troops who have crossed the border, and killed innocents, are animals, deserving of no sympathy?  Should Belarus civilians count sunflowers?  Should their troops stop taking prisoners?  What about all those Ukrainian troops who were taken captive in the first weeks of the war?  Maybe they're also animals?  Why are we giving them medical care?  Why are we giving them food?

People die in war.  Witnessing these deaths, and being helpless to stop them, can drive any human into a murderous rage, in which he will perpetrate worse crimes, and events will spiral out of control.  This is the purpose of the rules of war - to act as a limit when passions are high.  They are not to be discarded as soon as they become inconvenient.

The Russian soldiers are also people.  Some of them are no more than murderers.  But a lot of them are acting with commendable restraint.  Think about this each time you see a video of heroic Ukrainian citizens ""stopping"" a column of tanks.   Empty hands do not stop tanks.  What you are actually seeing is hundreds of Russian soldiers choosing to disobey orders, or report a failure, rather than killing unarmed civilians. We saw a lot of that at the beginning.

We've already fulfilled those two actions, and we haven't violated the four restrictions, so we've done our part as defined by the document. Russia, however, has repeatedly violated their commitment towards Ukraine.

That said, you can argue that we did violate our commitment towards Belarus with our sanctions in 2013, but we haven't violated any of our commitments towards Ukraine.

Of course, we aren't robots that only operate within the bounds of signed documents, so although the Budapest Memorandum doesn't require us to defend Ukraine, we can and should do more to support their efforts to defend themselves.

My best guess is that we're still analyzing various courses of action to determine the safest maximums for increasing our support without escalating this Russo-Ukrainian war into WWIII... at least not before we're ready for that, since there are still many unknown variables, particularly China, India, the Middle East, gas prices, etc. No one believed our pre-war warnings, so a lot of our delay is probably caused by waiting for everyone else to catch up to the new reality and figure out what they want so we can negotiate either their support as part of a coalition (economic or military or other) or their neutrality to at least isolate Russia in case we need to go in hot.

If I then ask, ""Can you at least buy me $100 of ice cream with an app and deliver them to my hospital room?"" You might think that's an acceptable request for you to fulfill. Maybe you think it's still too much since you don't know me, but you see that I really just need some encouragement, symbolized by the ice cream, and you decide to buy $25 of ice cream for me. You also feel good because you helped out in some way.

It's a win-win situation because I got something and you have the satisfaction of having helped in some way. Of course, this is where a choosing beggar can anger you because you're already doing something for a random person who may never repay your kindness, and yet somehow I'm acting like you're in the wrong because you didn't cover all of my medical fees when you didn't even have to care about me.

Whatever we all send to Ukraine is helpful and gives both of us a win-win situation. Some of us wonder why Zelensky keeps acting like that choosing beggar by asking for MiGs and no-fly zones when we're already giving so much and quietly dealing with massively increased gas prices (although it's nice to know we won't get randomly shot or bombed while we're banging our heads against gas pumps displaying exorbitant prices), but he's literally fighting off a Russian invasion ($25 of ice cream probably won't help him much in this case), so we're mostly patient, sympathetic, and understanding towards him because we realize that he needs to show his people that he will always advocate for them to the maximum by asking for something that none of us are prepared to give.

The Americans gave up on Afghanistan cos they had no way of beating the Taliban at their own game without taking massive casualties and that is a price they were not willing to pay. The Taliban hid out in caves in the mountains that are mostly impervious to bombing or shelling. There was only ONE way to beat the Taliban which is to put a lot of boots on the ground and have them sweep the mountains manually, going into each cave and hidey hold and engaging in CQB. The casualties for this will be horrific. This is why the US gave up and pulled out. I mean what else are they supposed to do? Bomb the rest of Afghanistan into submission? They're supposed to be the ""good guys"". And the Taliban had nothing out in the open anyway.

Russia is a different story. The US is likely capable of destroying every single Russian military base, ships, and their assets without having to resort to nukes. That is the sort of edge that the US army likely has over Russia. But will that beat the country down into submission? I mean if the Russians really wanted to resist like the Taliban, its a huge country with a lot of mud. There's no realistic way to go in and subjugate it without also taking horrific casualties.

They're not desperate. A proper cage can damage incoming missile warheads and make them less effective. Western tanks do this as well. Problem is, you are right, the newer more effective warheads have a better chance of defeating them and making it through to the tank, and the fact missiles like the javelin are designed to strike from the top. Presumably this shite standoff/cope cage was their idea to combat that. But obviously it wouldn't stop a fart. I was wondering when we'd see someone trying this and how effective it would be.

640,[],False,,LaBomsch,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_8bblaikz,False,False,"Ohh definitely, NATO would impose a no fly zone, a blocked and a total trade embargo and states like China and India would follow suit. However, I doubt Russia cares, because the negatives would be on paper negletiable:

1. Total trade embargo (aka. No more trade with China and India and no gas to the EU): the question is: what is more expensive: the war or the trade embargo? I think the answer is the war, but I have nothing to back it up as it is hard to estimate how expensive the war itself is, but I would say that the Russians exports don't cover the expense of war. 
2. No fly zone: it is important to note: if they use one or more tactical nukes, the war in Ukraine will effectively be over (at least the conventional war) and Russia could position it's AA systems all over Ukraine. NATO would have to make a super costly bombing campaign of Ukraine (I doubt that there will be many civilian deaths, NATO bombing is at this point very good at it)where it will have a ton of casualties: this will hurt them a lot. They can also throw ICBS or other rockets into Ukraine, but it won't make the difference. They can destroy Russian systems, but they cannot set a foot on captured Russian soil. 
3. Guerillas: this is a problem, however, Russia is very, very brutal, they can make a big campaign to just kill every form of dissents they come across. Displaysment and refugees would go even further up and Ukraine would be super depopulated, but this is possible (again on paper, tho the question raises: why even do all of this?). Russia has a lot of experience in suppression of opposition in every way deemed necessary. 

In the end, we have to remember: every step of NATO troops on Russian soil can trigger the end of humanity. Putins goal is to stay on power and NATO can by itself not get him away. After the use of such a weapon, they still can only indirectly fight the RF and it is debatable on how effective they can kill the Russian State (and we shouldn't forget: if putin fears western actions will cost him his power, he can just threaten with a missile and NATO has to stop).

Ukraine still has a functional air force, that they are rightly keeping grounded for the most part, they'll need them soon. 

Lets not forget the purpose of a no fly zone is to shoot other aircraft, If NATO supplied Ukraine with jets and Putin retaliates against Poland, WW3 starts.

Once that kicks off it's not NATO kicking Putin out of Ukraine, it's NATO going to Moscow. 

It's the Russian navel fleet in the red sea trading cruise missiles with the American's and British, it's Japan attacking Russia, American military attacking from Alaska.  

Imagine a Ukrainian family just arriving someplace safe when war follows them, or a tactical nuke? 

Lets not forget Ukrainian's are winning this, the Russians are using unguided dumb bombs , if they want to hit anything even close to target they have to get low, blow the clouds, and guess what the perfect weapon is to take them out?

The boat loads of Stingers we've been sending them. The stinger has flipped the table on Russian expansion ideas since the 80's,  Go watch Charlie Wilson's war with tom hanks, it's the history for dummies on exactly this topic.

Back to the Russians, now that they are falling out of the sky's the war chest is looking like it's  about to hit overdraft. 

The Russians are at the point where they are taking units that have been half destroyed and merging them with other units that have gotten the same treatment, They have to bring troops from other areas to feed into this meat grinder and it will only get worse for them.

Sooner or later they won't be able to sustain this loss, That's when Ukraine air force will hit the skys. 

And all the while NATO countries are moving tanks, bombers, troops, fleets closer and closer.

Putin will keep  leveling towns, he'll try and turn every town into dust. he's been wronged in his eyes and wants to hurt Ukraine, no different then when you leave a partner and they don't want it to end, they can become vindictive sometimes.

Eventually either Putin will cut a deal with Ukraine, or there will be a Russian revolution.

Because while Putin is getting his ass kicked in Ukraine 1 thousand rubles are worth $10.36 USD. 

Imagine how many people are out of work when almost every multinational company removes themselves from your country, car factories close, gig workers left without gig's

There may be Russian's that support this war and some that don't. regardless they are all still Russian, and these are the EXACT same condition's that caused the Russian revolution.

784,[],False,,Manofmanysins,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_4apubgij,False,False,"The assumption that NATO or US involvement in Ukraine will result In World War III is a delusion spread by a feckless President.  Historically, Russian and US pilots have fought each other over airspace that did not belong to either power.  This combat did not trigger a broader war.  As long as Nato aircraft limit themselves to Ukrainian airspace, Russia will not expand the war for several reasons.  

Russian forces are seriously overextended and severely under performing.  Russia simply lacks the combat capacity to expand the conflict conventionally, especially against vastly superior Nato forces.

Russia lacks the ability to provide logistical support to its current invasion.  Even if Russia could provide logistical support, the supplies that would be needed are already used or disbersed.  Opening another front will lead to a logistical catastrophe.  Russia simply cannot supply a second front.

Putin is a rational actor, albeit one who has made a serious miscalculation.  He knows that his nuclear deterrent, while large, is functionally obsolete, in extreme disrepair, and not likely to perform any better than his conventional forces.  In addition he is deeply concerned by the presence of Nato countermeasures that may make his nuclear deterrent even less useful..  His deterrance forces only have value if they are unused.  In contrast, Nato deterrence forces are expertly maintained, and constantly deployed.  If it appeared Russia might activate or deploy a nuclear strike, then a Nato first strike would likely result in totally or nearly totally incapacitated Russian first strike capability.  In an attempt to cover his weakness in this area, Putin has been touting his hypersonic missile tech, none of which is actually ready to be deployed.  He has successfully tested a very short range hypersonic weapons system the Tsirkon, but his other systems are either just starting testing or have already failed initial tests.  To date, it does not seem likely any of that technology could be deployed as a full scale, battle ready nuclear deterrent.

People will likely claim that Putin is unhinged or a madman.  This is simply not true.  Putin is acting in an absolutely rational way.  He has spent the last several months making more and more provocative moves, carefully gauging the west's likely response.  Throughout a carefully orchestrated build up, the west has signaled weakness and disunity.  Biden has fallen over himself repeatedly proclaiming in no uncertain terms that he would not use combat troops to protect Ukraine.  Germany did every thing they could to ensure that lethal aid was not sent to Ukraine.  Instead they sent some helmets.  The UK jumped on the no troops bandwagon like it was the last lifeboat on the Titanic.

Even Zelensky, who has since turned into a stalwart war time leader, seemed to be denial about the risk of a  Russian invasion.

Even after Putin recognized parts of eastern Ukraine as independent nations, the US and Nato announced toothless sanctions that would cost far less than the value of Ukraine.  Putin decided to move on.  As the invasion progressed, President Biden was torn apart by the White House Press Corp.  He picked his teeth and ambled off stage to try once again to convince Zelensky to flee the inevitable defeat of Ukraine. Western media went on a 24 hour news blitz of experts arguing whether Ukraine would last hours or days.  Few thought it would last a week. Putin listened to those assessments and put the petal down.  Indeed, Biden would spend so much time publicly exclaiming that Zelensky needed to flee because of  how easily the Ukrainians would be defeated, that a visibly irritated Zelensky would quip he needed ammo not a ride. Putin saw obvious weakness and tried to capitalize on it.

If the west would have shown any spine at all, at any point, during the lead up to this invasion, Putin had left himself several ways out.  Of course in typical Western fashion,  the US and NATO waited until it became obvious that Ukraine was not going to be a push over before coalescing behind Ukraine and adding teeth to sanctions.  

This disaster was caused by Putin, but it could have been prevented if only the West had not been so feckless.  As the war in Ukraine drags on and atrocities pile up, There are signs NATO may be starting to realize how weak Putin really is.  Zelensky needs to prod Nato as much as possible to support him.  By asking for more than NATO is willing to give, Zelensky causes NATO to give more than they would have.",91d072ed71106d4e68b67a6e4cc4ac5cfd400f12,True,False,,,,,0,1647481186,,0,{},i0yq12l,False,t3_tfrk47,False,True,t3_tfrk47,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tfrk47/zelenskyys_consistent_requests_for_a_no_fly_zone/i0yq12l/,1647481200,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647452386.0,

We lost a plane there. The struggle to establish a no fly zone means a lot of dead pilots on both sides. Maybe NATO is hesitant to advertise the practical limit of its capabilities and destroy the presumption that it can easily ""close the skies"".

But also, sending dead russians home that were killed by americans and europeans will have a much different effect on the russian population than russians killed by ukrainians. western aggression is the danger they've been warned about by putin and the subtext for the ukrainian invasion in the first place. suddenly, it's going to look like putin was right and russians who didn't approve of going into ukraine, may be suddenly stirred by patriotism and rally around putin.

Also, dead europeans and americans coming home is going to reduce support for ukraine in the west. there will be growing voices asking what the hell our boys are dying for a country that's not EU and not NATO.

I think it's clear that putin has bitten off more than he can chew, there are simply not enough russian troops to subjugate all of ukraine for very long, and the chances that his leadership is questioned/threatened back in russia are a lot higher if he just chokes by himself on his own overreach than if we get in there and make this a west vs russia thing.

&gt; \*IMPORTANT UPDATE\*    
Wali does NOT and DID NOT operate in Mariupol.      
According to the russian intox, he was killed in this city. A method used in psyops is to flood social media with false informations in order to make someone somewhere talk and disclose his real zone of operation by exploiting people's arrogance/feeling of invincibility. Be smart. An unconfirmed kill is not a kill.
