Sir, we must do more to help Ukraine! Since when do we negotiate with terrorists like Putin? Is that the American way? Our war of words will do nothing to stop the actual war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have the spirit of our founding fathers running through their brave hearts. Great men like General George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, their fight for our freedom, liberty and independence echos the struggle of Ukraine. In our War for independence we would not have been able to achieve victory without the assistance of the French. We need to be ""the French"" for Ukraine right now. If Putin is not stopped he will continue his bloody war beyond Ukraine just as he has in his past. Ukraine must be defended and Putin must be stopped. The balance of the free word is at stake, we are the only nation with the people and the power to do what need to be done to stop this. Yet we sit idly by doing nothing of consequence. The United States, our allies and our way of life is at stake. Just because Russian tanks are not in Poland or Portland right now does not mean that we are safe. We must utilize our military power to end this bloodshed. Please Urge President Biden and your fellow Congress men and women that action is necessary. Our enemies our empowered by our displayed weakness on the world stage by letting a war criminal run rampant and cowering at his pathetic threats and demands. We do no negotiate with terrorists.

&gt;What do these two stories (that we know of) teach us? The entire narrative of rockets that would ""fly automatically"" is a myth. It's a bluff aimed to maximise the nuclear deterrence effect. No sane commandment would ever do this considering how unreliable these systems are  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, there is a reason to believe that several independent mechanisms prevent some hothead from just launching rockets because he feels like that. That would explain why in 1962 decision to launch torpedoes was blocked both by military and political higher-ups

Ok, these are **utterly foolish** conclusions. Ridiculous. Reckless. 

This guy took two examples of where we came one officer's decision away from launching a nuclear war and his conclusion was ""nobody would ever do it."" That is fucking dumb, man. He neglects to mention that in the Arkhipov case, two others humans actually DID vote to launch the nuclear strike! In the other case, we have one human who didn't. So cumulatively, we have when it came down to launching a retaliatory strike, a total of 2 people out of 4 (a pathetic sample size for a study, to be sure) which is a 50% chance! 

I'm constantly appalled at the current narrative that many internet people seem to be pushing that we should actually attack Russia because they would not do a counter strike because of bullshit arguments like the above ones.

&gt; pressing on the emotional gas pedal 

Most definitely, it genuinely is quite worrying how many people are jumping on emotive impulses, I mean unsurprising but still worrying. Because as i'm sure you'll be aware this is kinda side show at the moment. It's still the early stages, I can't imagine the war will go on long, but it can get so much more nastier than this. Imagine how people are gonna react when we start getting the kind of stories and images that came out of Syria, what the emotional impulse going to be then?  


There was a podcast I was listening to recently by Modern War Institute (pretty sure it was their last one on No Fly Zones), 

  
https://castbox.fm/episode/Understanding-No-Fly-Zones-id2493454-id475105594?country=gb  
and I can't remember all the exact numbers but essentially there was polling done in USA recently, and it found that a majority of Americans absolutely did not want boots on the ground in Ukraine, but a similar majority did want a No Fly Zone enforced....

&gt;Ok champion you have done well I mean **other than sound like a lunatic** with a one tracked mind you have done well. 

Well so says you but we've already established you don't know what you're talking about so.  


&gt;Can I suggest something

Sure

&gt; instead of getting so wound up and jumping down peoples throats that you stay calm and attempt to explain your findings, opinions and knowledge?

Well I did explain it, thoroughly, you instead decided to set the tone ""champ"", and I responded in kind, and rather than address those points, you've long since abandoned it in favour of your perceived moral high ground on the conduct of debate. Eg  


&gt; People maybe far more receiving of you. 

I genuinely, do not, give a shit, for your perceived grievance. You started off repeating rhetoric that you clearly don't understand, and you did patronisingly, without even a shred of self awareness or irony. You're clearly an idiot. And I genuinely don't give a fuck for idiots.  


&gt; Also never judge someone you don‚Äôt know they may have something to offer no matter how small

lol hahaha, look at you boy trying to attempt wisdom. GTFO here you clown XD  


&gt;Because guess what and this may surprise you the way you have carried on makes you come across like an authoritarian dictator who is so caught up in their own importance taking pleasure in making them self feel good belittling others.

HAHAHA oh you are definitely emasculated arnt you. Just, pure lols at your emotive exaggerations. Pretty clear whos getting a bit upset over this. Just fuck off already and read an article or two rather than just headlines and memes.

errr Im getting more confident he'll use a WMD in Ukraine, he's completely and utterly fucked it up. Chemical seems likely, the precedent has already been set in Syria, maybe dirty bomb or a nuke but I think that's highly unlikely. And it would only be targeted at Ukraine, certainly not a NATO country.

&gt;And why is a no fly zone the catalyst for that?

Because a no fly zone is literally what it says it is. You fly, you die. NATO countries, shooting down Russian jets... Theres no ambiguity left anymore, NATO countries are warring with Russia. Once that point is reached it's only a matter of time before Nukes start getting exchanged.

I mean, I have only seen two types of people say this, specific politicians who have an interest in saying this, and general people who obviously dont understand what say, a nuclear winter is, or say strategies like, Mutually Assured Destruction.

I mean lets be honest, sorry, the fact you're even asking **why does No Fly Zone mean nuclear exchange** sorry. Anyone who understands this knows this means nuclear war.

Yea... in NON NATO countries........ has the penny dropped yet?  


&gt;I point at China and North Korea as examples of how you can subjugate a large population. 

Of course you can look at plenty examples throughout history, but the nuance you're avoiding here is utilizing that subjugated population to do something like.... invade a country. People can be subjugated through fear nut when you start forcing them to lay down their lives for you.... well.... you might start getting the kind of stalled effects we're witnessing right now...  


&gt;China took Tibet 

Yea they did, not with an all out war though...   


&gt;and **attempted** to take Vietnam.

Yea....  and how did that go?  


&gt;They are very vocal in their desire to take the ROC as well as building military presences on the territory of other nations.

Ok but Ive yet to see how this is relevant to what we're talking about.  


&gt;We can put our head in the sand or **we can do something.** 

And we are, providing weapons, logistics, relief, intelligence, accepting refugees, economic sanctions.... I mean, theres certainly more debate to be had about whether they go far enough.... OR TOO FAR.  


But enforcing a no fly zone is LITERALLY ENTERING THE WAR..... I feel like there's a massive elephant in the room that you're having contemplating the size of.  


You're literally saying, out of fear Putin will do something ie ""conquer the world"", something he has never stated and something that has never been done, and lets be honest, something that is clearly fantasy. Out of fear of that fantasy..... lets literally end the human species.... I mean. Again, sorry if this is the first war you've looked at, but get ready for it to be far, far nastier than this. We're still in the childplay stages.  


&gt;what exactly will be different **next time?**

lol *next time*, again, welcome to history, this isnt the first time this kind of thing has happened and it certainly wont be the last.  


&gt;Why would he stop if it‚Äôs working?

...Because it's not working? Where are you getting your info? You do realise militarily Puting looks pretty fucked here don't you? I mean sure theyve got lots of firepower, can still flatten the country, but they clearly CAN'T take it!

Have you paid attention to any major city battles in history?  Putin has clearly, completely and utterly fucked this up. So if he can't even take major cities in Ukraine, what fucking chance does he have of conquering ""the world"".   


&gt;My question for you is at what point would it be viable to try to stop Russia?

At no point.  


&gt; If they decide tomorrow to just nuke the Ukraine to dust and roll in would it still not be viable to intervene?

Nope.  


All up for providing support of every variety, supporting refugees, applying economic punishments and any variety of restrictions on Russia.

&gt;Look at China and North Korea. It‚Äôs more than possible to subjugate a country and fold it in.

Into what major wars have these populations been rallied?   


Saying something like ""look at China and North Korea"" when their societies are so opaque. Noone really knows what going on internally with these populations.   


&gt;Just because a view is simplistic does not make it wrong.

What view is this you're talking about?  


&gt;Russia did **the same** in Chechnya and a great deal of them now fight on Russia‚Äôs side.

the same as what? as what they're doing in Ukraine? No not really, Georgia is a far better comparison.  


&gt;Russia has nukes yes but so do we, if you allow fear of nukes to prevent you from doing any sort of intervention than we can basically surrender to China and Russia now.

That was literally what we were doing for the past 80 fucking years to avoid nuclear war.... what, exactly, is different now?  


&gt; Because eventually it will be the same scenario over and over. If your unwilling now you will be unwilling then.

Which is why Russia took over the world decades ago... Sorry but it seems to me an AWFUL amount of people paying attention to this topic, know nothing of history, infact no nothing of war, despite the plenty of examples just in the last few years over our lifetime. You do realise this is the EXACT same issue as was in Syria? Of course the war is completely different but the issue around No Fly Zone is the same. There were chemical weapons and bombing campaigns that eclipse what is currently happening in Ukraine, we still didnt enforce a no fly zone there..... because it means WW3 for fucks sake....  


&gt;The very concept of saying you will not intervene because of the nuclear threat is what allows these invasions to happen.

It literally isnt which is why Russia has never attacked a NATO country... again you're talking like you've just entered this topic thats been well discussed for decades.  


&gt;MAD only works if both sides are honest and willing to use them.

No it only works if you're dealing with rational actors.  


&gt;As soon as one side says they won‚Äôt it stops being a deterrent. 

Whos said that, noone said that? We're talking about initiating a no fly zone, IE, if this isnt clear to you, FIRING THE FIRST SHOTS IN WW3. Ukraine is NOT a NATO country...

Im pretty sure they know exactly what they would use them for.

Even if they had more planes than pilots that would be good. Better cycling of planes for maintenance schedules, more airframes than pilots means your trained pilots can fly more on reliable jets. 

1:1 pilots to jets is horrible for endurance. Any mechanical failure that grounds a plane becomes a reduction in force. Even mechanical upkeep is a problem because you cant standby a pilot without a matching airworthy craft.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comJERUSALEM, March 16 - Facebook on Wednesday removed official Russian posts that falsely claimed reports of Russia bombing a children&amp;#039;s hospital in Ukraine were a hoax, a company spokesperson said, even as similar messages appeared on other social media platforms.

&gt; The misinformation, on Russian Embassy Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts, circulated even after Twitter Inc(TWTR.N) and Meta Platform&amp;#039;s Facebook took down posts from the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom for breaking their rules against denying violent events, an Israeli watchdog found.

&gt; The posts on official Russian social media accounts claimed reports of the bombing were a hoax.

And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of **anti-Russia from Ukraine** and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.

Its about the ERASURE OF UKRAINE COMPLETELY AS A NATION, and the UKRAINIAN IDENTITY AS AN ANTI-RUSSIA like the anti christ to Russian existence. 

ITS ABOUT THE GENOCIDE OF UKRAINE. Its about PUTIN WANTING TO RETURN TO THE USSR and turn Ukraine into LITTLE RUSSIA.

This is THEIR OWN WORDS.

Stop fucking lying you fucking shill.

This is a war for conquest - for political and territorial power - and it was sold as a walk in the park. They thought it would be like when Hitler took over the Sudetenland, or if you prefer, when Putin took Crimea. 

If you‚Äôre fighting a war for your survival, then a negotiated peace that includes your survival, in whatever diminished capacity, might make sense. Russia is fighting for money and power, and to position itself for further conflicts in Europe. If it starts to cost more than they could possibly win, it becomes a losing proposition. Russia isn‚Äôt really threatened by NATO. There weren‚Äôt really Ukrainians looking to be liberated from a Jewish Nazi dictator.  

The reasons why the NK/Cuba (or older Soviet) comparisons may not apply when it comes to the Russian will to fight are twofold. First, the economic sanctions are severely reducing Russian quality of life. Going from 100 to 10 is a whole different story than going from 20 to 10. NK, Cuba, and the USSR were used to lower quality of life. Starbucks and Microsoft pulling out of NK isn‚Äôt a big deal. It is for Russians. Second is the people with actual power in Russia - the oligarchs - are affects strongly by this. That‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs base of power, and they support him because he makes them rich beyond the dreams of avarice. If he makes them poor, they‚Äôre going to pull their support. 

The announced basis for the war (NATO threat and Nazis) were lies. That‚Äôs becoming increasingly obvious, even in Russia. The actual argument for war - it would be an easy power grab that Ukraine wouldn‚Äôt resist and the West would permit - turns out to be an error. It‚Äôs no longer financially viable. All that‚Äôs left is assuaging Putin‚Äôs ego with Russian blood and treasure, and the open question is to how long Russia is willing to let that go on.",6c53090c5a0e513d6e979aa1b754c98fa5bd9d19,True,False,,,,,0,1647458181,,0,{},i0x6mgj,False,t3_tfbrnv,False,True,t1_i0wca5r,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tfbrnv/kremlin_in_unexpected_uturn_after_yet_another/i0x6mgj/,1647458194,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647429381.0
