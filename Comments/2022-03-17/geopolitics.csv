Though for all I know perhaps the Egyptian dictator was planning to retire in a few years anyway and the protests just brought it forward.

Getting back to the original question, I think politics is downstream from psychology, which is downstream from physiology. The Arab spring protests were mostly caused by an increase in starvation due to rising food prices. The relative material comfort in the west might make the broad population incapable of being motivated to protest effectively. At the other extreme many developing nations people are so poor and desperate that it is physically impossible to travel and spend days protesting since they lack the material support to do either (kind of like how effective 19th century strikes relied on sources of donated funds/food to hold the picket line without starving). Effective protest is possibly only possible somewhere in between. And I can think of a recent and effective protest that did force the government to fundamentally change direction. That would be the unprecedented farmer protests in India against pro-industry legislation being pushed through. But it took hundreds of millions of protesters sticking at it for many months to change the policy (which quite likely will come up again soon enough, probably when economic conditions have weakened the ability of farmers to protest like this again).

When he was part of the KGB, he wanted to become a real, cold war type of spy, preferably stationed in Berlin. Instead, his bosses thought he would be better in counter-espionage.

Counter-Espionage is a world in which you are taught to be at least a little paranoid, conspiracy theories are possibly real, and everyone is out to get you or your country. Most importantly, you have to be a good liar.

Now apply a psychiatric diagnosis to the type of personality that, we can see, very much thrived in that atmosphere.

He saw the collapse of the USSR 1.0 as a victory by the West, not as an inevitable outcome of the economic mismanagement by his own government. The collapse of USSR 2.0 was also inevitable, and for the very same economic reasons, as we can now see, his adventure in Ukraine has simply hastened it.

Now picture yourself in his place. You believed the West destroyed your country the first time around. You see protests in the streets, but to your mind, those are all instigated by the West. You crack down harder and harder, but the protests keep growing. People who were part of the propaganda machine are either coming out against you or are resigning.

He just fired 1,000 of the people who wait, hand and foot, on him out of fear that one may try to kill him. His greatest fear is that he will end up like Muammar Gaddafi, dragged out of a drainpipe he was hiding in and killed by his own people. Only he'll go to his grave believing it was all a ploy by the West.

The only thing we can hope for is that when he tries to lash out for the final time, there are Generals like those Trump had, who will not stand idly by, and will try to stop him from pushing the button.",248749197b084a68554bc9e08ddb99f678340f03,True,False,,,,,0,1647554417,,0,{},i12r8nx,False,t3_tgg1fs,False,True,t1_i12mwvm,/r/geopolitics/comments/tgg1fs/a_clear_argument_of_where_the_realist_account_of/i12r8nx/,1647554431,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647525617.0,

Mearsheimer is a offesnive realist. What you described in your first paragraph is offesnive realism

&gt;The USSR collapses, the US sees an opportunity to maximize its power. We wouldn't therefore say that it's the USSR's fault that the US invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, and has been involved in multiple regime changes since the end of the Cold War, now would we? States are reactive, realism promotes that the US will make attempts at stopping China from ascending to a global super power because it's doesn't want its own power to become threatened

This is defensive realism with the top proponent Kenneth Waltz

&gt;Russia is reacting to what it perceives as a threat. That is the key point. Putin perceived NATO as a threat. And why wouldn't he? NATO under the leadership of the US has been a champion regime change for the past 30 years. 

You are Russia = Putin, taking his interest and oligarchy as a genuine security concern. Secondly, when did the US start promoting regime change. It was 2003. That is 19 years. 

It was the color revolution that was his main concern like what happened in the Middle East and Central Asia around 2011. NATO is a shield, not a sword.  If the EU was promoting democracy, without NATO protection, Russia can just invade. NATO does not actually promote democracy or an organization made founded by democracies. Look at Turkey. What about Portugal which was a dictatorship when it joined in 1949?

The problem I have with this new-fangled realist as compared to classical realism is for offensive realism, you get into situations you are worried about relative power and we do our best to maintain that relative power, even if ends up hurting your actual power or interest. You will chop off an arm so the other guy cuts two arms.

Putin's ability to imagine ""Western domination"" in Ukraine failed him. He is operating with a healthy dose of whatever causes paranoia. He thought that Ukraine was, somehow, actually under the thumb of ""Western interests"" and that once those had been expelled, the remainder of Ukraine would simply acquiesce and be relatively happy to be under Russian control instead.

It rapidly became an untenable thing for him to believe, but I'd love to hear the conversations with whoever he still consults, when they came to tell him Ukrainians were fighting back fiercely.

Putin is capable of sending people to the Gulag. He cares even less about the people of Ukraine, of course.

The inflation caused by market reforms were a large factor in the chaos of the 1989 Tiananmen protests and those could have ended the CCP. The difference between the CCP and the Russian gov post USSR was that the boot of the state was still an option for the CCP.  Russia experienced 2000% inflation in 1992 and 1000% in 1993, they didn't have the boot or the external support to deal with inflation. One can argue that the reform period ended that year with the firing of finance minister Yegor Gaidar. many Russians blame Gaider for the chaos of the 90's and his firing basically marked the end of significant economic liberalization for a few years.   
Its pretty clear that economic growth is a core part of political liberalization, and hyperinflation, currency defaults is certainly a prime environment for politicians appealing to nationalism former national greatness.

In China, the equivalent would be the Chinese government revocating Basic Law in Hong Kong and repressing any opposition to it.

In other words, this type of aid was perceived as so much charity and given Russians' self-conception as a force on the vanguard of human history it was deeply humiliating. Keep in mind even the vaunted Marshall Plan's aid wasn't so much about the dollar amount--although that was considerable--but about improving the self-esteem of Europeans while factories and infrastructure were repaired and economies started humming again by the early '50s. Europeans were, for the most part, cured of their ""Great Power"" delusions (confirmed by '56 in Suez Canal Crisis) and therefore they accepted Marshall Plan aid in the right spirit and didn't resent it the way Russians with their 2 centuries old fantasy of being the indispensable ""policeman of Europe"" did in the 90s.

&gt; The pro-russian puppet had very little support with the actual ukrainian people. And rigging another election after having dreams of moving towards EU the political fervor was HIGH. 

Yanukovych probably did win the 2010 election.  It was declared ""free and fair"" by the OSCE.  Maidan started when he reneged on his promise to integrate with the EU.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The venezuela one is easy,Maduro had support and it is not known weather there was actually substation voter fraud.

Again, even prior to the build-up to the war in 2021, pro-Russian parties had support of a quarter or more of the population.  Support for pro-Russian parties in Ukraine were probably even more about 40% or so of the population.  Maidan never attracted huge rallies in places like Kherson.  This would be similar to the support of Chavismo in 2014.  And it was a squeaker of an election in 2013 that Capriles won and it is more of an open question because of lack of election observers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even if the opposition hates maduro, a puppet of the west gets very little support.

Ukrainians hate their politicians as well.  Why do you think that they voted for a comedian in 2019?  Zelensky was a way for them to give the middle finger to the system.  And yet, they still overthrew a Russian puppet in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Similar to how Russia puppet doesn't have support in Ukraine.

Pro-Russia politicians had a base of support in Ukraine prior to 2022.  They have 0% now, which is what happens when you needlessly slaughter civilians.

Because Putin is willing to lose a lot more in preventing the spread of democracy (or, if you prefer, conquering Ukraine) than the west is willing to lose defending it, and the ultimate losers of that conflict will be the people of Ukraine.

I think occupation is out of the question, because it will drain too much resources and an insurgency would be a major problem - it's basically certain NATO would be arming the resistance through Poland, Romania, etc. It's clear Ukrainians will hate Russia for the foreseeable future, so there is no benefit to trying to annex or occupy Ukraine.

Obviously, countries don't attack each other just because they want to shoot some missiles and that every war is driven by some political goal, if Ukraine can make the cost of invasion higher than the benefit of attacking, there will likely be no war between the two countries. Note, that doesn't mean Russia cannot defeat Ukraine - they will probably always be able to do that, just it won't be worth the effort (unless Ukraine does something very threatening, which would cause perceived benefit of the attack to increase).

You're right that Russian invasion suffered from horrible planning that was probably dictated by unreasonable expectation that came from Putin's inner circle (or Putin himself). However, given that invasions aren't easy and Ukraine has only three times smaller population than Russia, it's not too hard to organize and equip Ukrainian army to inflict enough losses on the Russians to make an attack pointless. For example, if numbers from Wikipedia are accurate, Ukraine has around 250 S-300 and 70 Buk systems. That's a lot and is enough to severely hinder any Russian air offensive (remember that Russia has around 800 combat aircraft in total).

Basically, the benefit of invading a neutral Ukraine is some X, while benefit of invading a hostile Ukraine is some Y (Y&gt;&gt;X). In order to ensure long term security of neutral Ukraine, you just need to ensure the cost of invasion would be between X and Y.

People tend to share information they like to their friends, and if they also like it the friends will share that information to their friends, and so on, and once certain thresholds are reached, that information can end up cascading throughout the entire network (go viral).

Why whenever there is a big hurricane or something, people start talking about climate change a lot more. 
Or whenever there is a big and obvious social  atrocity that occurs, it can easily take over a news cycle for weeks until everyone becomes experts regarding the topic.

If a movement is 'liked', it will still spread even if only slowly regardless of what others do to try and suppress it. If it doesn't, it simply means that movement isn't as 'liked' as you probably think it is, and needs to work on it's messaging. If you're expecting a movement to result in a transition within a couple of years, then that's very idealistic, although history does move faster these days due to technology to be fair.

Point is, often it's not just one movement, it's a series of movements over years that pressure one by one.

Some other things I'd say is,

1) Peaceful is better than violent. Violence can result in backlash, makes it an easy target to be suppressed (and there are scenarios where the power imbalance can be large enough that wanton suppression can occur). Peaceful can travel through a network un-noticed until it is too big to stop. Peaceful also encourages empathy, and encourages others to join in low risk low investment.

2) Sometimes a movement can 'forment' for a long time, until a trigger causes it to erupt.

A famous example is regarding the suffragette Emily Davison famously throwing herself at the King's horse. OR how the berlin wall fell.

The Venezuelan protests were fairly disorganized and not broadly popular. The Maduro regime was able to weather them pretty easily, all things considered. Dissatisfaction with Maduro did not translate into support for the protest leaders and politicians. And the US, the major power that could intervene, didn't go beyond sanctions. 

Ukraine's Maidan protests were also not particularly popular, until a big massacre by security forces that blew the whole thing up. Importantly, Ukraine's system of government was much more fractured, with various oligarchs holding significant amounts of power, who could turn on each other and the system when opportunity arises. You also have a kind of sectarian split, between western Ukrainian regions and eastern Russian regions. Venezuela, in contrast, didn't have any of that - they had a fairly disciplined central ruling bloc and no real comparable sectarian splits. 

Another couple of interesting countries to compare is Egypt and Yemen. Both had big, initially successful protests in 2011, with their respective dictators overthrown. However the state and ruling bloc as a whole was preserved. In Egypt, this ruling bloc (the military), which had major support from the US, overthrew the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood and re-instituted authoritarian rule. In Yemen, the post-2011 government was also overthrown, but by a re-vamped rebel movement lead by the Houthis, who had been shut out of the new ruling bloc but who managed to organize significant support and military resources.

While short-term shocks can disrupt that equilibrium, generally speaking they are resilient. A spike in grain prices due to a famine, an egregious public case of corruption by an official, or a miscarriage of justice, might send protestors or rioters into the streets. But unless the underlying political system is unstable, they are unlikely to result in significant changes. The assortment of political actors (labor, government civil servants, elites, armed forces, elected officials, monarchs, strongmen, public civil society organizations, large businesses, etc) tend towards cohesion rather than collapse.

So it is usually macro forces impacting these actors, rather than micro events, that impact the success of revolutions to break the existing equilibrium and re-align political actors towards a new one. Those forces are

* Changing Demographics
* Advancing Technology
* Changing Resources and Routes
* Evolving Culture

Those forces will pressure the system slowly, and then *converge* all at once in a salient event. Without a sufficient confluence of pressure from those macro forces, revolutions will fail. With them, they are often completely predictable (or as analysts like to quip, totally predictable with the power of hindsight).

So I don't want to do a full homework analysis but;

Demographics; Ukraine had a big [coming of age of the youth boom following the fall of USSR.](https://www.livepopulation.com/images/chart_age_ukraine.png) Whereas [Venezuela has a typical, stable population pyramid](https://www.livepopulation.com/images/chart_age_venezuela.png). However, Venezuela also experienced a significant brain-drain of expats during the Chavez year that removed many younger, urban, politically-minded professionals. They also experienced a significant influx of hundreds of thousands of latin American immigrants seeking economic opportunities

Technology; Ukraine has [129 cell phones per 100 population](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/#communications), vs [63 cell phones per 100 population in Venezuela](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/venezuela/#communications), and is generally further ahead in the consumer information technology curve. Ukraine's armed forces and police were largely equipped with old soviet gear or new Russian gear, while Venezuela has been buying inexpensive and effective riot gear and vehicles from China since 2005.

Changing Resources and Routes: from 1996-2014, Ukraine's imports from Russia as a percent of all trade fell from 49% to 23%. And its exports to Russia fell from 38% to 18%. Due to its holdover, Russian-linked oligarchical economy, Ukraine's GDP contracted by -15% during the 2009-2011 global financial crisis, amongst the worst performers in the world. Meanwhile, Venezuela's poverty rate fell from 50% in 1999 to 27% by 2011 due to lavish government spending on social programs funded by oil revenues. This was disrupted significantly by the financial crisis in 2014.

Evolving Culture: Commensurate with the post-soviet population boom, the people of Ukraine have been increasingly developing a separate national identity, an affinity towards the west, and adoption of western ideals on government, economy, and freedoms. Meanwhile in Venezuela, until the financial crisis Pro-Chavist attitudes were still widely popular, with few major changes in the political, religious, or social bearings of the population.

&amp;#x200B;

All of which is to say, by 2014 the macro forces acting in Ukraine made it a lot riper for a significant disruption of the pro-Russian political order - all that was needed was an instigating event.

If u call win,nationalistic groups leading the protests ,you got a very wrong and weird definition of successful protest movements.(Personal opinion)
Now facts:
Ukraine Euromaidan protests were heavily funded by an unknown donor(conspiracies claim to be US) and protesters in a sudden time got equiped with heavy weapons.
The Nazi and Nationalistic symbols were all over the place. The Euromaidan protests started as anti government but clearly very soon changed trajectory.

Also [Zelensky](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2021/10/4/pandora-papers-ukraine-leader-seeks-to-justify-offshore-accounts) is one of the most corrupt presidents ever passed from Ukraine.
Out of Panama papers leaks ,38 politicians were from Ukraine, the first most corrupt country in the world followed by Russia's 18 politicians.
He has ""washed"" billions of property through offshore accounts and has bought huge property assets in USA and London.

For the second part of your question culture plays a huge  condition in my opinion.
I tend to observe Southerners tend to revolt more and bloodier compared to Northeners. 
For example ,Greece , France , Spain , Italy are famous European countries which tend to riot often and quite bloody whereas Germany, Holland, Austria,Belgium only tend to protest and do not clash violently. Of course this is not a black and white policy but tends to be the norm.
Same applies to cultures in America I tend to believe. American's rarely protest and clash violently compared to the general population % and the current weapons they own/have access to, compared to South America for example whereas the most organized and rebellious movement of the 21th century has been born named ""Zapatistas"".

This is an incredibly powerful and stable republican system that allows for slow consistent changes when they are backed by a majority of the populous but which powerfully resists attempts to make radical changes by punishing those who try to implement such radical change.

The pattern of the US in world affairs is to encourage other nations to adopt the European model of constitutional proportional representative government which is a less stable form of democracy than the American model but which can implement the same sort of ""stronger than the elected politicians"" institutions such that it becomes very hard to take away their democracy without a war.

All of this is in the service of 2 major expectations beyond the obvious security implications.

1. Any member of a liberal democracy should be able to travel/relocate to a liberal democracy without much friction, major changes to their understanding of their rights and the expectation that they can depend on legal frameworks to settle issues rather than dictates.
2. Businesses (recognized as persons within the US framework) also get to operate with minimal friction within and between states and get to depend on rights such as property ownership and the ability to settle disputes in court.

Differences in social structure do not seem to be enough to fuel wars and major social change, ideologies are involved and connected as well.

You are absolutely right about real regime change originating from within, and I would say that your hypothesis about the means of production/subsistence being crucial still stands. Rome had many enemies and difficulties, but it was unsustainable due to its own internal economic and political policies (at least one would put that high up on the list).

This thing with Russia and Ukraine is very similar to what was happening in the Roman Empire from about 400CE onward, although Rome had more internal components and ""enemies."" Rome had secondary institutional structures (church, others) that could move into vacuums in state power to somewhat stabilize things. It still disintegrated.

The economic sanctions on Russia are going to be impossible for Putin to withstand longterm. Obviously, he's going to die some day, anyway, but I do think he'll be out before then. If he can find a way to save face, get a fraction of what he wanted in this war, he may linger. 

But Russia will continue to have an outflow of its own population toward the West. It can survive, but will be noticeably weakened and deflated by Putin's actions - but it will take folk observation and folk history to convey that to new generations, as unless something else (ideological) changes, most Russians will not theorize about it.

The demand for labour rose and therefore the farmers could demand much higher wages. (~ 14th century)

Not a revolt. It was a shift in economic power that led to higher wages and more rights but had nothing to do with a violent over throwing of the governments of the day.

&gt;The reformation protests and the subsequent unraveling of the political and religious landscape in consequence of Martin Luther's 95 theses. Had people not protested when Luther opposed the church, the Reformation would not have looked the same. (~ 1517)

Again, not a violent overthrow of the governments of the day. A religious revival is not a revolt.

&gt;The Boston Tea Party caused a spiral of reactions from the British government and in turn caused stronger and stronger protests which eventually lead to the American revolution (~ 1773)

I love this because everyone forgets the American Continental Army was led by a British officer, trained by a Prussian, and ultimately relied on the French Navy for final victory. The American Revolution is the quintessential the military turning on the state and getting support from foreign powers.

&gt;The Suffragettes are an example for a group protesting over many years. Protests don't always need to bring about immediate change, they can also pursue a long-term goal that aims at shifting the political landscape of opinions in their favour. Through their continued protests and even sacrifices, they managed to slowly shift the political landscape in favour of universal female suffrage. (~ 19th+20th century)

Female suffrage was not accomplished by a violent revolt by civilians against the government. It is a rare example of protests accomplishing something. But again still not a violent revolt. So my statement stands.

A certain set of norms and definitions which are set by the US and can be broken at will if those don't serve its interests. Examples of it are plenty.

&gt;China's rise is much more threatening to us because China under Xi and the CCP does not appear to share our values.

This is what can be called projection. You believe that since the US imposes its own values on the rest of the world because of its dominance, China must have that intention too. When have they done that or indicated their intention to do so?

The US is currently involving a rising India in the Quad as a measure to contain China, yet that country is increasingly evolving to an electoral autocracy. Why is the US showing no concern for its partner in that regard?

&gt;China's rise was far less threatening to us when there was still more hope that it might be accompanied by a shift towards liberal democracy. 

That's the narrative that is being pushed by the US Government and its think tanks since the US started escalating tensions with China. 

China was far less threatening to the US because it was not as powerful as it is now. Since the US now feels China breathing down its neck in every power projection domain, it's deperately doing everything it can to roll it back. 

It also did something similar to Japan, a democratic ally, during the 80's with success. Norms, values and democratic governance weren't issues then, but economic power was. The extent to which the US went after Japan to prevent its economic ascendancy is the same as with China, only the narrative was a bit different.

The fact is that, from the very beginning, China never had the intention of adopting a Western political system. It has been very clear about this. Now, when Western democracies seem increasingly unable to take good care of their own people's wellbeing, it's even more convinced that it shouldn't become one. This is a sovereign right that should be respected.

&gt;If Xi doesn't understand this, or simply doesn't care, then it's unlikely he'll take any steps that might ease the fears of the US and our allies. And so we'll continue to work to isolate them, and tensions will continue to escalate.

It's always wild speculation to guess what goes on in world leaders' minds, but if I was one and had a look at the record of everything US foreign policy has done until now, I would be very skeptical of believing the narrative that changing my country's political system would ""ease"" fears of the US and its allies.

Marches only work once certain thresholds are met. Otherwise they barely accomplish anything as again no ones money/resources/convenience is hit (politicians being clearly shown they are against a majority if a threshold march is met, is something that causes them inconvenience). 'Striking' has always been one of the better ways at protesting, as it hits other peoples bottom lines, and demonstrates their dependency on you.

Either way, to me that's a semantics thing, so I won't go too much deeper into it.

Instead you talk about democracies. What do you think about the fact that future generations are being priced out of the housing market, how they are having to trade off even having the opportunity to have children due too their inability to afford spaces of their own, or having to pay extreme amounts as rent simply to be allowed to exist.

This sort of thing is a regular thing in democracy, where people are living longer and longer, and the ones most likely to vote are the elderly house owners resulting in societies structured such that the young are being exploited to benefit the elderly as leaders attempt to appeal to the voter base.

This is likely not going to change anytime soon without an extreme level of protesting.

Just because it was a democracy, doesn't mean they acted so efficiently and quickly because they were a democracy. They acted so quickly because the women attacked the bottom line of money/resources/convenience (+ inability to have sex of all the men, not a joke point) and also met threshold requirements.

And I believe that a consequence of this weakness is the fact that he will be unwilling to test the loyalty of his subjects in the matter of a nuclear conflict. 

Another indication of this weakness on the internal scene, are:
* his latest ""fly in the mouth"" discourse about a ""fifth column"" which, in my opinion, is the end game for a leader: to turn against his subjects 
* and the latest attempt of rallying the people under a common sign, Z, which comes too late to have any meaningful galvanizing effect. The Nazis needed about 10 years between the introduction of the Swastika and the beginning of the WW2.

The unanimous negative reaction of the international scene, or the restrained support at best, seems to be mirrored on the internal scene and I'm sure that no decision factors in the military will be willing to carry on the orders of a compromised leader especially since the territorial integrity of Russia is not questioned.

To call Xi a ""strongman"" is to rob the term of any meaning, and yourself of any understanding. Even if we completely discount public participation in the Chinese system- which we shouldn't, given its sheer scale and the fact that even Western studies corroborate high public confidence in the CPC-  the PRC is not a thin autocracy of one man held together by brute force. It has learned from the troubles under Mao, and especially from the defects and collapse of the USSR, and has consciously developed robust governing institutions and contingencies both within the state itself and within the Party (see, for example, its cadre system). Certainly, Xi has great influence, but to assume that his power is without check, that no other heads are influential within the system, or that he is even necessarily integral to the Chinese state would make the same mistake the West did in believing its own propaganda about the USSR. At the very least, the Politburo and its Standing Committee constitute a collective leadership regime.

It strikes me more than anything as wishful thinking, as Western takes on China often do (and this one does aplenty otherwise). Rather than accept that there is any *there* there to the Chinese system and take seriously its approach to governing, which has unpleasant implications in the Western mind, it is far more comforting to write it off as another black-and-white tyranny predicated on simple violence.",65a52b6ccfa0c38f01bf5056eae1fab161152605,True,False,,,,,0,1647519055,,0,{},i10c0yk,False,t3_tfj6jl,False,True,t3_tfj6jl,/r/geopolitics/comments/tfj6jl/xi_jinpings_faltering_foreign_policy_the_war_in/i10c0yk/,1647519066,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647490255.0,

My intend is not to correct your statement, but this small yet significant difference may prove useful in your analysis. Libyan nationalism on the other hand is something that rose with Gaddafi's fall. Generally, after the Arab Spring, nationalistic movements became even more prominent and the Muslim Brotherhood, managed to install various puppet governments in Arab countries. Those governments were placed to overthrow the secular regimes, imposed by the Anglo-Saxons and the French decades ago. It created a sense of nationalism that each Arab state has its own place in the Arab world and moved the notion that the Arab world should form an official grand scale confederation (EU style). But that would be it. Confederation. Not federation and most definitely not a unitary state. Egypt, however, would urge for a more consolidated Arab Union than the other members.

 Now Gaddafi's policy was not to create this Pan Arabic world for 2 reasons. 

1) A Pan-Arabic world would  be ruled be either Egypt (arguably the center of the Arab World and a simile with what Germany is to EU), or Saudis or even the UAE (kind like the equivalent of BENELUX). 

2) A Pan-Arabic world would be centered in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, while the Maghreb countries would be considered as a backwater and their resources would be exploited for the good of the Union rather than their own good.

Therefore Gaddafi pushed for something else. It's not exactly Pan-Africanism, as someone stated, but it doesn'thave a clear name. It encompasses countries from the Sahel and west Africa to the Maghreb, centered at Libya maybe. The common features of those countries are their common cultural heritage, as a mixture of Islam and Maghreb people and their common energy grounds. That would be Gaddafi's dream, to unite Maghreb, Sahel and generally North-West Africa, in a union that would mediate between the West and the Arabs. A move welcomed by Europe, since they could exploit easily the energy of those regions (especially France), but a move not seen well by the Anglo-Saxons and the Arabs. Thus the Arab Spring spread also in countries of the Maghreb.

This is a very problematic and false claim. Revolts and protests absolutely do have the capacity to change policy and bring about reform. Even the history of the last 1000 years proves that. 

1. After the black death had struck Europe, farmers and peasants had their bargaining power increased simply by the fact that their numbers had dwindled and they were essential to the ruling class. The demand for labour rose and therefore the farmers could demand much higher wages. (\~ 14th century)
2. The reformation protests and the subsequent unraveling of the political and religious landscape in consequence of Martin Luther's 95 theses. Had people not protested when Luther opposed the church, the Reformation would not have looked the same. (\~ 1517)
3. The Boston Tea Party caused a spiral of reactions from the British government and in turn caused stronger and stronger protests which eventually lead to the American revolution (\~ 1773) 
4. The Suffragettes are an example for a group protesting over many years. Protests don't always need to bring about immediate change, they can also pursue a long-term goal that aims at shifting the political landscape of opinions in their favour. Through their continued protests and even sacrifices, they managed to slowly shift the political landscape in favour of universal female suffrage. (\~ 19th+20th century)  


To say that protests ""didn't do anything"" is very much false. History is full of successful protests that changed the world. Even nowadays protests can change the face of the political landscape. The protests in the GDR ultimately toppled the frail government, allowing re-unification. The Tunisian revolution in 2010/11 lead to a subsequent democratisation of the country.

When dictatorships are put under strain, do they have to create narratives or give concessions? Has Belarus, North Korea, or China given up anything to protestors? Has Putin softened up?

I worry that some foreign policy stakeholders fail to understand how interests are perceived by their adversaries, which would result in avoidable strategic error. 

Basically, reading this article's ""analysis"" feels like sipping the kool-aid.  For example, the article argues:

&gt; [T]he more powerful Xi becomes and the more direct authority he exerts over Beijing’s foreign policy, the more adverse the outcomes are for China’s long-term strategic interests.

* Criticism of Xi Jinping will always be well received here, however much it may replace facts with adjectives and reasons with innuendo.  And that isn't to say I disagree with all of those characterizations, because, as the author argues ""Xi’s . . . support for Moscow"" in invading Ukraine was a ""major foreign policy misstep,"" to the extent it ran afoul of American interests.  But, whether that support was in Xi's long term best interests remains to be seen.  

* Further, Xi's ""decision to retaliate against EU officials last March in response to sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang"" did ""cost Beijing a long-coveted investment deal with Europe,"" but so what?  There will be other deals and the repercussions for Xi's egregious human rights violations in Xinjiang and with respect to the Uyghur Muslim population there and the greater diaspora are miniscule in comparison to the costs imposed on him or China as a result.  Xi clearly perceives that genocide to be in both his and China's interests, and has failed to change course as a result of any sanction imposed as a result, by any western actor.  To wit, nothing whatsoever has changed.  The genocide continues.  Emphasizing one allegedly ""coveted"" trade deal with Europe when the Biden administration will do little more than bark is reaching too far.  Counting the wins where they accrue is important, but tremendous work remains to be done.   

* Additionally, Xi's ""threats toward Taiwan are,"" in fact ""driving Washington and Taipei closer together and forcing other regional powers, such as Australia and Japan, to declare their own compelling interest in Taiwan’s security."" But, consider that: (a) the ""compelling"" nature of that interest was already well established, (b) ""declar[ing]"" it now is unlikely to be perceived as anything other than what it is --- purely symbolic and (c) the only thing that matters is whether the United States is willing to prevent forcible reunification, and based on what Biden is allowing to happen in Ukraine now, Biden is clearly unwilling to do anything with the military whatsoever.",0e3d6b66371fd17296f376bb395b5d99da6af178,True,False,,,,,0,1647490723,,0,{},i0z9qzj,False,t3_tfj6jl,False,True,t3_tfj6jl,/r/geopolitics/comments/tfj6jl/xi_jinpings_faltering_foreign_policy_the_war_in/i0z9qzj/,1647490734,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647461923.0,
