Frankly, you must be uneducated to know the U.S supplied those arms to the Mujahideen to fight for their country back after the Soviets fucked it over and afterwards, we left them to run their own business. 

 I remember 9/11as a pretext of WHY we were there in the first place. And it was (with overwhelming evidence) the work of Osama Bin Laden who killed thousands of innocent U.S civilians and forced our hand due to Afghanistan descended into civil war after the Soviet Afghan war and then the Taliban took over which became a cespool for terrorist activities. And they did that on their own. I remember Iraq invaded Kuwait for oil and that became the pretext for our first of many tangles with them and their dictator of a leader Saddam Hussein who did some.......""questionable"" things in his role as president years BEFORE the U.S invasion considering his government was notorious for its severe human rights abuses (*cough* Iran-Iraq War, chemical attack) so yeah. I know this shit. You'd have to be a fucking moron not to know. But funny how none of those points came across your post. You clown.


And frankly, yes. NATO will invade. It's only a matter of time. If you think Western leaders will stop at sanctions then your just as dumb as the others who buy that crap. However you must have forgotten as well. The U.S has the SECOND largest batch of nuclear missiles in the world (Hell, with seeing how Russias army is using outdated broken down vehicles I wonder how many of their nukes work). We also have an Air Force with skilled pilots who can intercept those missiles. CIWS, advanced warning radar, ICBM interceptors, etc. We don't have fucking Healthcare but we have a more advanced armed forces than those Russian Cowards overseas. 


As for Snowden and Assagne, that's on them. You leak classified documents, you get taken care of. Same with any other government. Russia makes any political opposition ""dissappear"". All governments are selfish cruel and downright nasty. If you can name ONE government that doesn't have a history of fucking its people over I'll give you a fucking cookie. It's like you think I'm the president and I have the power to just ""undo"" all the fucked up shit the U.S did over the century. Well I can't. All we can do is apologize, acknowledge it and move on.

Now Norways army is too small in any case but if Russia invaded solely from the border that would be a costly move. However, if they made landings all along the Norwegian coastline down to ex Trondheim (which is more plausible an option) that would make it much more difficult for Norway. On the other hand, Norwegian navy and air force is a lot more powerful relative to the army and the country as a whole. Given how the Russian Air Force is doing in Ukraine I think the Norwegian Air Force (as long as their ground support and airfields exist) would entirely wipe out the Russian Air Force. Norway is also getting new submarines now, and along with the skjold-class corvettes and Nansen-class frigates they may keep Russian naval activities limited to operating north of Lofoten. A big win if so, seeing as the decisive land battles probably will be fought in the Narvik region, or possibly in the Skibotn area to the north.

I must say, you seem reasonable in your reply so I still have hope for you, but I would strongly encourage you to look into this matter further. Putin is certainly wrong for bringing violence on civilians, but this War has been predicted for years because of what the US are doing expanding NATO towards Russia, and funding an overthrow of Ukrainian government to install their puppet regime, and funding neo-nazi batallions of the army (openly supporting facists and arming them for this war)

You've been trained by reddit to think I'm a russian bot or a Putin apologist but in reality I'm an Irish dude who wants people to live happily, and that includes the people on Donbass, where men, women, and children have been dying since 2014 because of the Ukrainian government bombing them - the soldier saying goodbye to his little girl is fighting for his right to independence from a government who wishes him and that little girl death. The people of his region (the Donbass - Donetsk Peoples Republic &amp; Lugansk Peoples Republic) have been enduring this racist treatment for years and literally invited Russian forces to intervene for protection. Now this doesn't make it right to send in tanks, but I hope you have some understanding as to why this conflict is happening in the first place. It's not as simple as Putin = bad, Ukraine = good and I'm glad we still have journalists who are willing to speak out against this censorship.

I see the rest of these shills on mainstream media with their overt racism talking about 'civilized' Ukraine as sorry excuses for journalists as they blatantly ignore the truth and fail to inform the public. Disgraceful as they are directly leading to more death.

If we did put a no fly zone then if o e pilot is shot.down its down to the collective of NATO to agree to trigger article 5 again not 100 percent that we would active it. 


These sanctions will work better for the long run with Russia as long as the economy does collapse unfortunately this will effect normal Russian that are against this war.


There a lot of issues all packed in to this situation but the likelihood of him doing anything to Nato is very slim he been talking about his nukes for years it's just the tipacal dictator man syndrome. 

Honstly friend try not to worry about it if he launch we launch and you will want to pray that we go in the exsplosions.

It makes zero difference what NATO says it will or won't do, what matters is how Russia sees NATO's expansion east. There's no question Russia sees this as a threat and NATO knows this fact. Still NATO pushed the Ukrainian membership on Russia and this is the result.

My main point stands, this mess is on NATO. After creating the mess, now they're all quiet and let others handle the aftermath. If NATO was so adamant Ukraine must join, it should be sending boots and aircraft to make sure Ukraine can join.

Yes it'd probably would cause some tensions but that doesn't lead to WW3. Besides Finland is now considering joining NATO mainly  because of Russoan threats. Its clear Russia wants the option to invade its neighbour without going into WW3.

Also NATO has never denied an application because of Russia and they never will. They have literally 3 requirements to join.

1. Be European country
2. Be a democratic country
3. Have stable and secured borders.

Ukraine couldn't have joined because it had a civil war in its own border.

A TL;DR on why Ukraine joining NATO could be a serious risk to Russia is Russia is a terrible country to defend from the east. It has lots and lots and LOTS of flat open ground that enemies like Nazi Germany have exploited in the past. Ukraine, Belarus, if one of those countries became NATO, Russia would generally lose a conventional war against them.

So Russia invaded to secure its borders. And here's where I think Putin miscalculated... Russia is Europe's biggest supplier of gas and oil, it's essentially a lifeline for Europe. Russia had seen NATO's reaction to the annexation of Crimea and China's takeover of Hong Kong and believed he could deal with the sanctions and possibly threaten Europe with no gas and oil.

Except... they pulled that card away from him... and they brought down some of the worst sanctions against Russia. To the point where these are the kind of sanctions that are the equivalent of two nations at war. Even I was surprised by the heavy sanctions.

Now Putin is in an abysmal situation. He can't stop the invasion as it'll make him and Russia look weak, along with unifying the Ukrainian people into joining the EU and NATO- which he can't have. But he can't have the sanctions as this will ruin his country's economy and will cause civil unrest that made lead to an uprising in his own country.

There's no doubt that if Putin leaves right now. The sanctions would be lifted as the EU is shooting themselves in the foot while targeting Russia with the sanctions. But if - and that is a big IF- Putin wins this war, those Sanctions won't be going anywhere until the EU needs those supplies from Russia. But that'll be long after Russia's economy is completely dead.",d4b472390b2f1c1dba0070342413d047a3a32f1c,True,False,,,,,0,1646409929,,0,{},hzbwna4,False,t3_t6h44c,False,True,t3_t6h44c,/r/war/comments/t6h44c/why_would_putin_invade_knowing_his_country_would/hzbwna4/,1646409943,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646381129.0,
