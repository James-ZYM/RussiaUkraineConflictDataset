Barring a sudden total collapse of the Ukrainian Army, Ukraine still has the advantages of extremely high morale, NATO countries showering them with state-of-the-art man-portable weapons that negate Russia’s advantages in armor and aviation, interior lines of supply, and borders to friendly countries to the west. Critically, they’ve won the hearts and minds of the populations of the west, which means the aid they’ve been getting is going to be sustained, including the best military intelligence-gathering systems in the world.

If Russian prosecution of this war doesn’t improve - and there’s no indication that it will - there is no way for them to obtain by force what they sought when they started this, namely the removal of Zalinskyy, installation of a Quisling president, and no occupation. They’ve failed miserably because they gifted Ukraine with the most precious commodity of all - time. 

At this point Russia’s only option to end this war on terms favorable to it would be to use WMDs, and use them on the civilian population. That would dramatically increase the risk of NATO intervention *and* still fail to provide them with a quiet puppet state, so I doubt they’ll go that route.

[],False,,LanguishViking,,,[],,,,text,t2_1hm5vrvg,False,False,"Motti  
Motti is Finnish military slang for a totally encircled enemy unit. The tactic of encircling it is called motitus, literally meaning the formation of an isolated block or ""motti"", but in effect meaning an entrapment or envelopment.  
  
The word means ""mug"" in many Finnish dialects; an alternate translation refers to a cubic meter of firewood, a relatively small area in which an encircled enemy could be ""cut down"" like trees. motti is thus related to kessel. A motti in military tactics therefore means the formation of ""bite sized"" enemy units which are easier to contain and deal with.  
  
This tactic of envelopment was used extensively by the Finnish forces in the Winter War and the Continuation War to good effect. It was especially effective against some of the mechanized units of the Soviet Army, which were effectively restricted to the long and narrow forest roads with virtually no way other than forwards or backwards. Once committed to a road, the Soviet troops effectively were trapped. Unlike the mechanized units of the Soviets, the Finnish troops could move quickly through the forests on skis and break columns of armoured Soviet units into smaller chunks (e.g., by felling trees along the road). Once the large column was split up into smaller armoured units, the Finnish forces attacking from within the forest could strike the weakened column. The smaller pockets of enemy troops could then be dealt with individually by concentrating forces on all sides against the entrapped unit.  
  
A motitus is therefore a double envelopment manoeuvre, using the ability of light troops to travel over rough ground to encircle enemy troops on a road. Heavily outnumbered but mobile forces could easily immobilize an enemy many times more numerous.  
  
By cutting the enemy columns or units into smaller groups and then encircling them with light and mobile forces, such as ski-troops during winter, a smaller force can overwhelm a much larger force. If the encircled enemy unit was too strong, or if attacking it would have entailed an unacceptably high cost, e.g., because of a lack of heavy equipment, the motti was usually left to ""stew"" until it ran out of food, fuel, supplies, and ammunition and was weakened enough to be eliminated. Some of the larger mottis held out until the end of the war because they were resupplied by air. Being trapped, however, these units were not available for battle operations.  
  
The largest motti battles in the Winter War occurred at the Battle of Suomussalmi.

&gt; A generating unit at the plant has been hit during an attack by Russian troops and part of the station is on fire, RIA news agency cited the Ukrainian atomic energy ministry as saying on Friday.

&gt; &amp;quot;As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,&amp;quot; Orlov said on his Telegram channel, citing what he called a threat to world security.

3. Push into Dontesk and Luhansk

No idea on if he had the Americans in between a rock and a hard place in Georgia but it would not surprise me.

Putin imo puts national security above anything else financial/ citizens the works and will do whatever he see’s as necessary to reach those goals.

I do not think arming Ukraine or Taiwan would make a difference. At best we make Russia’s fears about the west correct, look what happened when Cuba got Russian nukes the US lost it shit.

They could just target another nation or do we arm any nation that gets threatened with nukes. Likewise unlike the western nations Russia and i believe China both have no qualms about striking first with nukes. 

The thing that keeps MAD a viable option in my mind is nuclear subs. Land based launchers can be hit and Russia / China have a lot more land than say Ukraine or Taiwan they could believe with a first strike they could eliminate the threat with little  risk. 

Now if Russia wished to do the same with the UK they could obliterate us but they would be very unlikely to find the subs.

He quickly figured out that he had to give military control to people who knew what they were doing if he wanted to win, which is something Hitler never learned.

It's increasingly looking like Putin fell into the dictator's trap: remove/jail/kill your opposition to the point that people don't want to tell you the truth for fear of their lives or career. So you end up believing your own bullshit. For someone from an intelligence background, it's almost incomprehensible he fell into it.

I was initially one of those who thought (despite it being a strategically bad decision) that this was going to be an overwhelming show of force and that they'd be in Kiev in a day or two and the coup/annexation part of it would be over so fast that the west would just be able to protest. I knew the Russian military wasn't comparable to NATO or anything but for the strategic genius projected onto him I expected a well-executed plan.

What a No fly zone exactly means, and how it's enforced. 

Sphere of influence. (Ukraine is in Russias sphere of influence)

Nuclear powers. 

fog of war. 

Read (takes half an hour/hour) then you understand that there is a way nuclear powers work. If you are ready to most likely risk either all of humanity, WW3, or the total (!) destruction of Ukraine, you don't want NATO to intervene. 

Putin is a ice cold killer, lier, and despot, but he also holds nuclear power with a destructive power to obliterate the world twice over. Now there is litte chance that he does anything as long as it's a contained conflict, but if NATO should engage and obliterate Russia, he would for sure. 

It will not escalate into NATO nor into Russian territory, NOT going to happen. If it does pray every hour you're still alive. 

Ukraine might fall, but Russia is not able to hold it, resulting in Ukrainians winning in the end. 

After a desaster on Russian side in the beginning, Russia might agree to Ukraine independence for annexation of Krim, Eastern and Southern Ukraine.
That would be a worse outcome than when Russia pulls back on its own.

&gt;The BTG’s may be vulnerable to raids, counterattacks and other surprise movements because reliance on analog C2 limits subordinate units’ ability to understand and react to changes of circumstance.


&gt;A BTG had the entire brigade’s support and enabling resources, but it had only one mechanized-infantry battalion


&gt;According to Russian Army manuals, in the field as many as 50 percent of infantry soldiers can be required for local security and routine administrative tasks. This leaves relatively few infantrymen available for mounted squads. Squads are usually organized ad hoc and are less than fully manned,which makes them less effective and less independent. For opponents, it also means that it requires fewer casualties to neutralize the Russian squads.


&gt;The lack of infantry causes BTG commanders to prefer to isolate urban infantry strongpoints for prolonged sieges instead of assaulting

The document also goes into supply issues that BTGs will likely face.

This helps explain the current situation with the lack of infantry support and the supply line issues the Russians face.",16c5654d7769da994f889406c2bd23367615816b,True,False,,,,,0,1646445991,,0,{},hzee2z9,True,t3_t6yxhz,False,True,t3_t6yxhz,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t6yxhz/a_2017_document_from_the_us_military_about_flaws/hzee2z9/,1646446003,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646417191.0

Russia’s economy is smaller than Italy’s but they have the largest military in Europe by a wide margin (twice that of France).  They spend about 11% of their GDP on defense, but their per capita GDP has shrunk by 1/3 over the past 9 years.    Russia expends about 60B+ (less than 1/10 of the US budget) but that money is spread significantly thin because they have to maintain their massive nuclear arsenal, and Putin recently launched a large effort to expand and modernize navy.  In addition to this there’s probably a significant amount of corruption within top leaders (and maybe all the way down) siphoning off a portion of the funding.  All that is to say, that the Russian military has to be skimping somewhere, probably in key areas like pay (lower quality troops), training and maintenance, and another likelihood is that commanders are also falsifying reports to command about manpower, readiness, etc. to make themselves look better to command but also out of fear.  
Why is there corruption?  Corrupt autocratic regimes by necessity have corrupt military leaders because dictators must value loyalty over competence.  Why? because competent uncorrupted military leadership poses a significant threat to the power of a corrupt autocratic leader.   In 2012 Putin sacked his top General Makarov over alleged ‘corruption’ and replaced him with Gerasimov.  The reality however may be the exact opposite as Makarov had attempted to significantly downsize military after the conflict in Georgia because numerous issues reported to him by commanders.  Those changes were largely unpopular with the Oligarchs which is presumably why sacked and they were reversed.

It makes very much seem female life to be more valuable than male life. One gender is protected and allowed to flee while the other is to be used as cannon fodder.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sexism is the belief and treatment of one sex like it is inferior.

Britannica definition : Sexism = ""prejudice, stereotyping, or *discrimination*, typically against women, *on the basis of sex*.""  
If being forced into death for no other reason than the gender you were born with isn't discrimination on the basis of sex, I don't know what is.

&amp;#x200B;
