The US and Canada can produce oil using shale but it’s a method that is only really sustainable/profitable when oil is above a certain price (I think around $60 a barrel). Oil wasn’t at the price for a while due to covid and everything going on. They have been ramping up and slowing down production since the method was first used. It’s not like flipping a switch though and will take a bit of time. There are a lot more things that go into the price of oil other than just simple supply and demand since oil is an international market and because of things like oil futures. It’s not something as simple as “buy it from somewhere else” so even if production is increased it might only alleviate the issue not make it go away. 

Regardless, I get going green and fully support it but I do hope Biden and his admin push more domestic oil production to help people in the short term.

I think it is difficult for all people in the United States (including politicians and policy makers) to understand this fear. We enjoy the protection of our sovereignty by the greatest natural barriers of any country in the world(the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans). And in the end…geography dominates…and this is why the United States dominates. As a society we have no concept of the destruction of modern war, starvation, or deprivation of the comforts provided by peace. Thus we have no motivation to understand the perspective of a society that has been constantly reminded of it’s physical vulnerabilities (Russia and the whole of Europe included).

We are generally taught the the United States has never started a war. While this is not the truth, it should shed light on the thinking that expanding NATO could never be wrong because we would never allow the alliance to strike first. I think this along with a general misunderstanding of the fear on both sides of invasion and war has allowed us to become greedy in allowing NATO to expand into Eastern Europe 

In regards to business…if you want to understand the United States and it’s regional, geopolitical and military movements throughout history…understand this…the foundation of the United States was a business decision by merchants, almost all of the people who initiated and supported our independence from Great Britain were businessmen upset with taxes cutting into their profits.

-the video doesn't address the question of why different states would want to protect themselves against Russia by joining NATO? Maybe the perceived threat is from the other direction. Ukraine has as much right to sovereignty and security as Russia

-a point I don't see many people making is that NATO Is a defensive security alliance, that has no intention of attacking Russia. The evidence: it is not attacking now in any way even with a war on 'its doorstep'.

-the video talks about Russia's doorstep, Russia's back yard, Russia's sphere of influence. Is this relevant? Isn't Ukraine in Germany's back yard? Russia is huge and has lots of doorsteps, does it require to influence all countries that surround it? And if they don't want to be influenced? They get invaded?

-Ukraine wasn't close to joining NATO. This is a distortion in the video. NATO just didn't want to declare any country as being not able to join in future
-why is the answer to NATO expansion to invade Ukraine? It doesn't make much strategic sense. It's not NATO.

-the video references a 2007 quote as Putin's 'last friendly warning'. What? He invades in 2022 because no one listened to him in 2007? That's crazy. Obviously it's not true that this was Putin's last words on the subject but it shows how the video is poorly made and argued. I could do a better job of arguing Russia's side

-the video talks about russian paranoia and humiliation at losing influence in neighbouring countries. Maybe Russia just needs to decide it's not an empire any more. Britain lost a much larger empire with great humiliations in a short time period and after being on the winning side in a world war, like Russia. Why didn't the UK turn this humiliation into aggression to its former territories? How come Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan etc can move on from their empires and 'spheres of.influence' but Russia can't (the answer is Putin)

These are just a few points and reactions but I agree that the west could have done more to stop this and that eastward expansion wasn't essential for NATO. More should have been done through diplomacy.

US and EU economies are resilient but they've been pushed to the edge even before this started due to COVID response fallout and the subsequent inflation and stock market bubble (especially Nasdaq), supply chain disruptions, energy disaster in Europe, etc. The timing Putin chose is no coincidence, he knew there would be sanctions, he however underestimated US and EU resolve and the amount of economic pain we were ready to suffer.

Putin could be considered a megalomaniac up to a point, but imbecile hardly. As for Trump (which may or may not be an imbecile) he's the one that actually triggered the current escalation by approving lethal aid and weapon sales to Ukraine in 2017. 

While Ukraine wasn't getting into NATO de jure, we were definitely investing in bringing the training and infrastructure up to NATO standard de facto. If you look at the first 5 targets hit in this war by Russian cruise missiles, they were all our investments easily convertible to NATO standard, like Ivano-Frankivsk airport, that naval facility near Odessa etc. If that's not a message IDK what is. Also There were other things we were doing to threaten Russia, like those warships in the Black sea last year or the fact we flew strategic bombers to within 20 miles off Crimea and more.

There's always a fine line between advantage and disadvantage, and that line keeps shifting every day as a new technological breakthrough is made.

Back in WW1, tanks were basically big steel tubs with tracks and fuck off cannons attached. As weapons were developed to combat the WW1 tanks, the tanks evolved to fight against these problems.

12.5mm round can penetrate our thin armour? thicker armour.  
Field guns can easily acquire a line of sight on us? Better engine for mobility.  
Enemies are taking out our tracks and moving into positions where our guns can't hit? Move the main cannon on top on a rotating swivel.  
Other tanks are using specific rounds to penetrate our armour? Make our armour slopped to make the enemies rounds deflect off instead of penetrating.

Eventually, you get to the point where today's tanks have things like ERA, Chobham armour, IR smoke, Trajectory prediction computers, ATGM, Active protection systems, ECM jammers and a whole list of defensive and offensive equipment that tanks are fitted with for them to survive in battle. 

The fact that the NLAW's, Javelins, Tows and Knokurs are performing well against close to modern-day tanks is simply because the advantage is currently on their side. The NLAW was made in 2002, fighting against tanks made in the mid 70's. I would like to see the results against the T-14 or Leopard 2A7 but its doubtful we'll see that anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll probably see a major change in tanks over the coming decades to be more mobile and lighter while emphasising on keeping the crew safe in a compartment. But I'm doubtful that we'll see a complete removal of tanks in our lifetime.",feaf78786bf2513da41fbca650665860d8649bba,True,False,,,,,0,1646883531,,0,{},i02azix,False,t3_takg23,False,True,t3_takg23,/r/war/comments/takg23/with_nlaws_and_javlin_missiles_becoming_more/i02azix/,1646883545,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646854731.0,,

659,[],False,,Witty-Lettuce5830,,,[],,,,text,t2_97oj9j5f,False,False,"I'd say no. Anti-Tank Capabilities have always been a common threat to tanks dating back to WWII. As their designs and lethality have increased with decades on, so have the capabilities and defenses of Tanks against infantry capable AT weapons.

Tanks are primarily used for infantry support roles. As there's no way of carrying a large cannon around the battlefield for direct-fire infantry support, this role is filled by the tank. Eliminating bunkers, fortifications, fixed/entrenched positions and enemy armor help troops advance on the battlefield while reducing casualties taken. Say for example you have an infantry squad pinned down by two machine gunners operating from a fortified bunker or pillbox inside a town. No routes of advance are available for the infantry squad to move and they already have a few members wounded. They need that bunker destroyed to stop incoming enemy fire and prevent the enemy from reoccupying that position. An M1A2 Abrams rolls up and puts a HEAT round into the bunker/pillbox and eliminates the threat. Now the squad can muster and continue their push while the tank provides support. 

Vehicle armor has allowed Tanks to operate and somewhat thrive in areas where they suffer most. The M1A2 Abrams utilizes TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit) to operate in urban areas where they are most vulnerable. You also have ERA (Explosive Reactive Armor) Slat, Spaced, and other various types of ways to protect the tank and the crew. For example, the M1A2 Abrams utilizes a blowout panel and stores the ammunition separate in case of detonation while the T-72 and other Russian Tanks with Autoloaders sit on a carousel of their own ammunition, which causes the ""Jack-in-the-box"" effect (i.e Turret separating from the hull and flying into the air.)

I don't think Tanks will become obsolete. After all, Helicopters and other types of aircraft are vulnerable to FIM-92 Stingers, CIWS, Ground-to-Air Missiles, etc.  And no one seems to think that Helicopters will become obsolete if they can be shot out of the sky so easily. Tanks serve too important of a role for them to be replaced by anything else.",67951529e06dbf00c05402e31d3aee646831d31b,True,False,,,,,0,1646881296,,0,{},i026bv7,False,t3_takg23,False,True,t3_takg23,/r/war/comments/takg23/with_nlaws_and_javlin_missiles_becoming_more/i026bv7/,1646881312,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646852496.0,,

If putin started establishing a permanent military presence on our canadian or mexico borders we would react similar.  If we kept our nose out of ukraine, none of this would of happened. Putin isnt going to just absorb ukraine after this conflict if he suceeds and reestablish the ussr officially. ukraine will still be ukraine, but without western nato influence, protection, funding etc. Russia may however end up offering to provide protection of ukraine if they are ever invaded in the future by anyone.

Why be confident on their currency? Because they have tons of tons of gold. They were hoarding gold for decades now. They can safely anchor their currency on gold.

On the other hand, USA's currency is based on nothing, definitely not gold. Except some nations are using it as reserves. If the trust of the US dollar fails, it becomes practically worthless.

Do you have any idea just how unfair the business competition in China is? Both my parents and I are from there. My parents regularly has to work with companies in China. Ever since China opened it's doors economically, western companies of all kinds have flocked to China for it's cheap labor and manufacturing. Along with these companies went machinery, expertise and in some cases, trade secrets. Many western companies have agreed to share expertise with a partner Chinese company to work on a project together, only to have the project become reality and then get sued in the Chinese judicial system so the Chinese partner can take complete ownership of the products created. Then western companies either get banned or are forced to drop their claim to their share of profits from said product and leave China.

The original comment I was responding to showed extreme contempt for ""reddit users"". I don't agree with their point but I can understand the frustration. I don't know how to word this frustration without sounding insulting so as a disclaimer, I'm not trying to be mean here but everywhere there are always people saying ""you cant do xyz because they will just xyz"". You absolutely can and you absolutely should in some cases because banning tiktok will literally not lead to China committing economic suicide. Tariffs will increase, some businesses might well lose business in China. It will hurt in the short term but when will people like yourself start to realize that at some point ***you need to realize that China is your adversary and you need to do something to stop relying on your adversaries?***

**The very fact that you have to do something is going to cause China to do something back to hurt you in return.** You can't possibly think that China is going to let you ween yourself off of the crack cocaine it's feeding you without putting up a fight? It's either you take an L now and find other ways to become better or you take the L now and that L keeps becoming a bigger and bigger leverage.

As someone who's pretty left, I don't normally support things on the right's platform but goddamn getting off of China is one of the most urgent things the U.S needs to recognize. It's not going to be easy and you can't do it without hurting your business interests but the economic future and dependency of your nation matters a whole lot more than any temporarily revenue of any business. Just like pulling out of Russia, companies will find their ways to regroup and reinvest. Forcing that reinvestment into countries that aren't an active adversary is far better than feeding the arm that's choking you.",ee6bbe609530ce5ee00f7fe06d4f14baa0dda930,True,False,,,,,0,1646863124,,0,{},i010rut,False,t3_ta5ctd,False,True,t1_i00tmig,/r/war/comments/ta5ctd/chinese_media_is_reporting_within_russias/i010rut/,1646863140,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646834324.0,,

At the same time, for Mexico to want to join a Russian defense league, many American people would be questioning why did relations between Mexico and US become so bad for that to happen. What I mean is, many American people would become suspicious of what the Inited States was doing to cause this situation to happen, and quite possibly, the leaders of the government would be voted out, so that a new government strategy could be developed, a strategy that would seek to make relations between Mexico and the United States better. Russia does not have elected politicians. There is no way for the Russian people to decide for themselves how they want Russia to be. The elections are fake. The news media is fake. Why is it a crime to say that there is a war in Ukraine? And even if the United States bombed civilians, murdered innocent people, why is it OK for Russia to be doing this right now? Why not let people decide who they want to be? Why not let Ukraine decide who they want to be? Why invade Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine? There is no excuse. These are separate people with their own interests. Russia does not care about them. The Russian empire is gone. Those times are gone. People around the world have seen what is possible with democracy, and real elections. That is why people protested in Tianenman square, before they were shot and killed. And why do you not think that people in the East do not want  a democracy like the United States? Why do they not want the power to choose who represents them, by having free and fair elections? The Soviet Union was a grand experiment, but it failed. There were some good intentions, like providing equal opportunity and education for its citizens. The problem with governments that are controlled by regimes, like Russia, the Soviet Union, and China, is the government cannot react quickly enough to adapt to situations that occur. Look at the one child policy in China. Now China has too few people. Look at the fall of the Soviet Union because of poor government planning, and not being able to focus resources where the were needed.

English is not my native language, so it would be difficult for me to answer all your questions using google translate, I'm sorry ahaha In any case, I will try to capture as many questions as possible with a short answer.  People in the East just think differently, believe me most do not want a democracy like the US.  I think that the reason for the fear of an attack on their country is justified, after they have experienced great horrors in the last little more than 200 years from the European powers whose successors are now members of NATO.  I know that the people of NATO are not presented with a situation as if there is any plan to attack Russia, I also believe that it does not exist at the moment, but what do you think guarantees the Russians that they will not experience what they have experienced twice in the previous 2 centuries?  I think that the people of the US also mostly did not want the wars that the US is waging after WW2, correct me if I'm wrong, but that didn't help much, as far as I remember the US had almost half a million people in Vietnam at one time despite all the protests.  It seems to me that the US-China conflict is approaching very soon, I believe that the whole situation against Russia can be connected with the US fear of China, but we can only guess what will happen in the future, in the early 30s no ordinary people could imagine that the horrors that would happen in the following years would happen, people thought they were more civilized than that and would not make those mistakes again.  Before the attack on my country, we also did not expect anything like that to happen.  Russia is not half as strong as NATO, which is why they are so afraid.  I don't know how much you are aware of the geographical weakness of Russia on the border with Ukraine and how strategically important that border is to them, in case what happened already before happens again and Ukraine is a member of NATO, Russia would fare much worse than previous times.
