You have to realize this is a patently ridiculous demand that I assume you mean rhetorically. People are correct that video of some hits is not a basis on which to calculate accuracy, as logically why would the russians release footage of failed launches?

Furthermore, hit reporting via osint is difficult, because as you know Ukraine’s government has asked civilians not to share photos or information of missile hits so that the information cannot be used to correct targeting data. 

The failure rate seems shocking to me, but frankly we have seen the russians struggle with their equipment at several points in this war.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to advance southeast of Izyum near the Kharkiv-Donetsk Oblast border.  
Russian forces continued steady advances around Severodonetsk and likely seek to completely encircle the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area in the coming days.  
Russian forces continued to make persistent advances south and west of Popasna toward Bakhmut, but the Russian pace of advance will likely slow as they approach the town itself.  
Russian forces in occupied areas of the Southern Axis are reportedly preparing a “third line of defense” to consolidate long-term control over the region and in preparation to repel likely future Ukrainian counteroffensives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. Russan forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to Northern Kharkiv in the near future.  
Russian forces are prioritizing cutting off two major highways to Severodonetsk but may start to storm the city before they successfully cut GLOCs.  
Occupation forces in Mariupol will continue to strengthen administrative control of the city but are likely unsure of what the ultimate annexation policy will be.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in Southern Ukraine.",4fbeac25b63c56adf3dbd076601ebfff1ccc758e,True,False,,,,,0,1653607154,,0,{},ia4m2ru,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t3_uy5zcd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia4m2ru/,1653607165,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653578354.0,

I know exactly what my facts are and enough has been discussed about this, atleast in Pakistani circles. The MIG21 was detected and this is why it was shot down. PAF has invested heavily in data-linking its AEW&amp;C and Ground Controlled Radars, thus Sq Ldr Nauman had a very clear view of the MIG21 flying low. The tactics you're referring to are somewhat outdated of the IAF's plan of flying the smaller/nimble MIG21 low and ambushing PAF's fighter sweeps.    


&gt;Not sure why M2K bugged out or if they were present at all, I will leave that to the experts. It's well known that the Sukhoi didn't get a firing solution.

Same thing, they were jammed and they were smart enough to bugger out because PAF had setup a kill box. This is why the SU30MKI's had no firing solution is because they were also jammed.

Instead, the Russians committed units that were reconstituting in Belgorod that were in the strategic reserve. So they did bite, but not the units that the UA needed to bite. 

Same goes for the counterattacks the UA launched toward Izyum from the west, that too was a spoiling attack that threatened the flank of that entire axis.

It helped them that at that time that axis wasn't vital because by that point the northern pincer axis had moved to Lyman and parts east of that.

Some interesting inconsistencies, in no particular order, appear to be the following:

* The claim they were down to eating one potato a day.  Later in the article it's explained that happened occasionally only when the daily food resupply was unable to arrive - a development that appears to align with increased fighting on their line.
* The claim of insufficient weapons.  The article later discusses that Lapko's company has 4-5 RPGS per 15 men.  I could have misunderstood, but that seems to be an adequate amount of AT weaponry for a squad, though perhaps the actual AT weapon itself is not as effective as, say, western-supplied munitions.  The other issue appears to be that they mention Ukrainian tank support in the beginning as a detriment because it gives away their position, but these tanks conveniently aren't mentioned when Lapko claims he has insufficient fire support for his soldiers.

However, these inconsistencies do little to mask glaringly massive problems:

* Their command unit is hogging resources and vehicles, and clearly not rotating, maneuvering, or otherwise leading Lapko's company.  Lapko described handling many of these tasks himself and in isolation from other units.  This is particularly concerning given that they are serving on one of the final lines protecting the southeastern flank of Severodonetsk.
* The casualty rate is stunning.  They're down to a little under half of their original combat strength.  Admittedly, some of the folks who left did so because they realized what it meant to volunteer for combat.  However, their combat casualties are still alarmingly high.  The article doesn't mention reinforcement whatsoever, but clearly his unit is not being given additional manpower.  
* Supplies, and seemingly manpower, are not reaching combat troops in the Severodonetsk salient.  Other articles and sources continue to describe this increasingly mythical operational reserve, but I think a force with game-changing strategic potential feels a little far fetched if Lapko's company is anything to judge the on the ground reality of combat units near the front.

You just made that up. Per the IISS, the total number of active personnel in the UAF in early 2022 was 196,600, of which 152,600 served in the ground/naval infantry/airborne assault/special forces. There simply couldn't have been 120,000 ""regular troops"" deployed in the Donbas at the time.

&gt;you are trying to claim that today, at the peak of the battle they only have 35k, are you on drugs?

I'm saying the maneuver formations currently deployed in the Severodonetsk salient have an establishment strength of \~25,000 personnel. You might have missed it (it's very subtle), but the Russo-Ukrainian frontline extends beyond the Severodonetsk salient.

&gt;this is the same mythology that claimed that only a couple hundred soldiers were lost on the Mariupol/azovtal debacle.

Mariupol was defended by the following units:

\-36th Marine Brigade  
\-109th TDF Brigade  
\-12th Operational Brigade, National Guard (includes the Azov Regiment)

For a total of \~10,000 personnel at establishment strength. The Russians claim to have captured 3,903 POW, which would suggest \~5,000 Ukrainian KIA, assuming the aforementioned units began the siege at full strength.

&gt;Before the encirclemts between 8k and 15k soldiers were defending the city but it is imposible to know because ukranias keep their numbers very hidden, some stimates put it on 20k or even 30k.

They don't all need to be combat arms, but society has to be mobilized in a controlled manner, and having the military do it makes it easy, as it's an existing structured organization.

Likewise enact Stop Loss, nobody is getting out besides special exceptions.

Unfuck their logistics. Enact a goddamn Proxy Czar if they have to but they can't keep begging for shit to have it sitting in western Ukraine and then bitching that the troops in battle don't have enough. Someone highly competent needs to be put in the position to fix that and given the authority to plow through opposition and red tape.

Train up the TDF as best as possible, try to turn them into legitimate credible soldiers. Those in combat arms need to be focused entirely on conventional offensive ops, the TDF's days of small unit harassing ambushes are over. Pick and choose based on harsh selection to separate who goes where. Most TDF were doing combat arms, a lot of them don't belong in combat arms. 

Use foreign troops wisely. Some of them have very valuable skills and shouldn't be used as cannon fodder. It's also very dangerous to use them that way because when they leave they can control the narrative of how fucked up things are. Ukraine is going balls to the wall to control OPSEC but they can't do that if foreigners are leaving to then shit talk to the media or write their books that talk down UAF abilities.

Start rotating combat units out of Ukraine whenever possible into ""training centers"" in Poland and elsewhere in NATO to give them a break. They can't be attacked there, it's a safe haven. Allow them to get drunk, get laid, decompress. Try to avert the worst of PTSD, as psych casualties in a war like this are going to be high. While they're there, that's the time to replace equipment and induct new replacements into those units, give them a few weeks doing training together on specific mission essential tasks to develop cohesion, then they go back into the fight. 

Bring back division and corps HQs. As of now the UAF has operational command zones and under them a absolute fuck ton of brigades, independent battalions, and independent companies. That's a recipe for disaster. If they can't find the officers, start begging the west for help, asking for retired officers to serve as staff officers with each assigned their own translator. I bet a whole lot will bite and sign up, one last hurrah to finally kill Russians despite their bad knees.

Start reorganizing air assault brigades. Let's be real, they're not doing air assaults in this war, Russian ADA is too good. And only mech units can survive while moving in an artillery centric environment. Of existing air assault brigades, convert most into mech units. Of the rest they turn into regular infantry units. Of those, rotate out the high quality troops to put them in the mech units and put in lesser quality reservists and TDF replacements, and use the lower tier less mobile infantry brigades to do economy of force operations like defending quiet sectors. Right now it's the opposite, a lot of their best troops, their ""elite,"" are in units that can't be the main effort on the offensive without getting slaughtered by artillery. Fix that.

Of the high quality mech units, train them all HEAVILY in urban warfare. This will pay off. Possibly even use a few brigades as test beds for urban warfare to use in the first battles in the counteroffensives and then send half out to use as cadre for everyone else, while the remainder become dedicated urban specialists that the division and corps commanders can use for the toughest assignments. Task organize and arm them for that fight. 

Invest HEAVILY in engineering units who specialize in mines, especially for mechanized forces. The Russians are going to seed the ground they control with probably millions of AP and AT mines. The Ukrainians can try to deal with that now or later but either way they're going to deal with them. Better now. 

Ukraine SOF units are to take on duties of special reconnaissance sabotage, and unconventional warfare behind enemy lines exclusively. To conduct successful offensives means more than just intel from US provided SIGINT and IMINT plus drones, they need deep reconnaissance to find out where the Russians are strong and where they're weak. This doesn't just need to mean MACV-SOG type recon, or expert SOF sappers probing minefields to find gaps, it can mean a team inserted to link up with Ukraine partsan cells to do some OSS type stuff. They also need to organize, train, and lead partisan cells, while also arranging them to be properly armed. 

Find out how to defeat Russian drones, ask for that stuff from NATO, and build a legit counter drone company in every brigade. Also, invest more in their own drones. 

This will all help, though I doubt they'll do that well attacking without air superiority.",ba77aca7f881f6a840fccb12277fb0e2a68949a0,True,False,,,,,0,1653601130,,0,{},ia48yrz,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t1_ia37fu1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia48yrz/,1653601145,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653572330.0,

We have committed less than 0.002% of our budget to defend a friendly nation's sovereignty, mostly through weapons we weren't planning to use anyway.

[],False,,HopingToBeHeard,,,[],,,,text,t2_17922t5s,False,True,"Americans are so obsessed with wonder weapons that it’s concerning. The history of who thinks like that and where it leads isn’t exactly pretty, and the psychology behind it is usually ego driven and childish. That’s not to say that weapons don’t matter, or that which ones matter don’t change. Weapons can be critical, but to paraphrase a movie I like, every weapon has an inherent flaw: the user. Weapons don’t achieve much good outside of a strong strategic framework. 

We’re so focused on how great we think our weapons are that even our focus gets focused on the best case scenarios. It leads to us forgetting the basics, and even becoming hostile towards them. Ukraine had a massive numerical advantage and was on the defensive. They are clearly losing, and things like wheeled howitzers with new recruits are not going to matter in dense terrain against long range rocket artillery. 

We can keep throwing in stuff to try to help on the tactical level, but taking a bunch of stuff that’s been barely trained on and getting it through Ukraine and supporting it so that it can work cohesively without plenty of combined arms exercises isn’t going to make a fighting force that can do anything that the previously large, well equipped, well trained and largely experienced Ukrainian forces that are losing would have. 

Russia has plenty of gas, food, and valuable materials. It’s as close to a self reliant country as anywhere else on the globe. It still has good relations with much of the global south, and our misadventure in Ukraine has moved them ever closer to the resource rich and well armed manufacturing powerhouse that is China. Sure, we make fancier stuff in some areas, but plenty of the materials that make that come from Russia and China or places friendly to them. 

How much of a digital advantage are we going to have when most of the worlds chip production, including most of the best of it, comes from areas China can credibly control or destroy them if they choose? Elections are close in Hong Kong, they could flip to China at any time, and they aren’t going to be supplying us with anything if a war breaks out. Besides, where are those manufacturers going to get the Neon to make those chips?

Maybe we can fix our chip supply issues, increase our ship building, get our deep space launch capability properly sorted, sort out our rubber supply issues, check inflation, end the food shortages, reverse how much our economy is taken up by healthcare costs, find ample supplies of rare earth minerals and uranium, ramp up neon and nickel production, get more missiles into service and in numbers, do a better job at affordable ship design than we’ve done in decades, solve the recruiting and retainment issues in our armed forces, and either drill, build, or research a way out of the energy crisis. That will take years, and that’s not counting any of our other priorities, that is a minimum of what we will need to do if we are going to win the economic war and prevent losing the arms race that we’ve all but committed ourselves to. 


Our eurocentrism is showing. India isn’t having any of this, not that they won’t do business with us or take our money if it works for them, but they aren’t turning against Russia. Israel won’t give Ukraine lethal aid. Saudi is thinking about moving away from the petrodollar. In Asia, we’ve basically lost the Solomon Islands, Singapore is moving closer to China, and the Philippines just elected someone who’s a fugitive here in the US largely because he wants to get along with China better. 

We’re so busy personalizing and blaming that we don’t seem to see that much of the world doesn’t agree with our administrations claims of innocence as this hits the global encounter and threatens people with starvation. As if Russia doesn’t want to trade its food. We’ve created a perverse incentive by trying to ruin it economically while it’s in this fight. We are giving them no reason to leave and every reason to stay and take more of Ukraine’s resources. For its part, China has noticed, and they see us trying to case chaos to their north. We’re advertising that they are next. 

We are picking a fight that we aren’t prepared to win, and for much of the world they are going to see this as our fight. John McCain went to Kyiv, where he pushed for revolution along with our ambassador. The revolution was violent, and since then we’ve been eager for NATO expansion while we piled arms into the country and ignored how they violated numerous peace agreements. 

We’re backing a government that’s only controls about half its territory, that has had millions leave, that accomplished nothing with a large army, and that lies to us constantly. Ukraine’s forces aren’t going to beat Russia for us, and we aren’t going to beat Russia and China without a devastating war. This is already hurting us. Killing a few more Russians while we spend billions pouring weapons into a lost fight isn’t going to change anything for the better. .",17a3e5ad3a540a911becf6eb265befba66413a00,True,False,,,,,0,1653594205,,0,{},ia3sr5e,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t3_uy5zcd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia3sr5e/,1653594223,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653565405.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, former supreme allied commander in Europe, drew a distinction between the Ukrainian tactics of seeking to target Russian armored vehicles and troops with artillery and the Russian bombardments of towns and cities.

&gt;“In the big scheme of things, Ukraine is trying to do maneuver warfare to regain territory and cut off resupply routes,” General Breedlove said. “And Russia is doing more of a grinding, attrition-based warfare.”

Well that's a pretty strange take. Then again Beedlove is an Air Force fighter pilot. 

The Ukrainians in Kharkiv were doing a spoiling attack, pushing back a few Russian BTGs doing an economy of force defense with the goal to push Russian arty away from the city and to try to threaten the Russian supply line to get them to pull forces away from the Severodonetsk salient battle to strengthen their rear and weaken the offensive capabilities attacking the salient. 

Russia is attempting a double envelopment of a salient, the operational pinnacle of maneuver warfare, the type of operation that Germans Cannae crazy ""operators"" used to jerk off to. The US Army preaches the importance of breaching operations to reset positional warfare into maneuver war, and that's just what the Russians are trying to do, and achieving. 

The Kharkiv counteroffensive has had mixed success. They pushed back most of Russia's artillery outside the range of the city, that's good. Russian units that were in the reserve in Belgorod were committed to counterattack, that's good. Though not the ones attacking the salient, that's not good. But they didn't cut the GLOC either or even threaten it bad enough, since the Russians in the salient offensive didn't bite. Considering the iffy results, could those units and the supplies they consumed been used to defend the salient for better results? Probably.

Meanwhile, the Russian breakthrough at Popansa was exploited by their operational maneuver group, classic deep battle maneuver warfare doctrine. And they apparently just took Lyman, so they're that much closer to pinching off the salient, which might also trap large numbers of UAF inside of it. It won't be the big success theyv initially wanted if the Izyum drive would have worked, but still pretty impressive.


It won't mean much in the grander scheme, they still punched themselves out achieving ground that doesn't hold value needed for a bigger win.. But they did fully ""liberate"" Luhansk oblast, which can count as a strategic victory. They gained the river to build a defensive line to resist later counteroffensive. And regained some respect because, assholes or not, they did demonstrate they could win in the most densely defended area in Ukraine.",1d4c23796c05e19eed2bc8432162497060bb73dd,True,False,,,,,0,1653592298,,0,{},ia3o5hu,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t1_ia36xvs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia3o5hu/,1653592310,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653563498.0,

If we dig further into the matter, of course we know Russia attacked Ukraine entirely unprovoked, that Ukraine is not a puppet state and that their war effort is immensely popular within the country itself, and that the US has compelling reasons to support them (avert humanitarian crisis, prevent Russia from attacking other countries in the future, etc.) Yet, we'd need to follow the thread beyond ""US fights yet another proxy war against Russian influence; starvation and death ensue worldwide"". And the US has alienated so much of the world through invasion, proxy war, economic warfare, and espionage, that I imagine many people in these areas are less inclined to take a deep breath and consider the nuance in the Ukraine war.

Throughout the third world, the US has consistently fought proxy wars with puppet states (see: Vietnam) or installed dictators (see: Operation Condor, the Argentine military Junta of the 1970s, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, etc). So, if you live in one of the many regions the US has invaded or otherwise meddled in, I'd imagine you're less likely to give the US the benefit of the doubt or to look into the nature of this particular proxy conflict further. 

China and Russia do not turn third world countries against the US in a vacuum; they (cleverly) play on the fact that the US has torpedoed its own credibility with these regions, and they play on the consistent history of US proxy conflicts and economic warfare to present a familiar narrative that casts doubt on anything the US says or does.",b2369441b6687f5f943b73930262d78b1f7ba079,True,False,,,,,0,1653590782,,0,{},ia3kgr3,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t1_ia321xs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia3kgr3/,1653590800,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653561982.0,

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Nobody is answering your question directly so I will, towed AT never really fell out of favor with Soviet style forces. In the west we replaced WWII vintage AT first with recoilless rifles, which were more man portable than a wheeled AT gun, and then later with ATGMs which were either infantry carried (LAW and Dragon) or fixed (TOW). 

In Russia you see similarities, eventually lost towed AT is phased out for ATGMs: eventually the RPG series of rockets or AT-3 and its descendants. You also see lighter recoilless, especially in lighter units, take over as flexible heavier AT. But, interestingly, heavier AT remains of the WWII type towed gun. These guns were largely 100mm, virtually identical to what was mounted on the T-55. These guns are cheap, reliable, and carry a mean punch. They’re enough to knock out even an M-60, though not at range. While they’re inflexible compared to an ATGM, compared to a 120mm US recoilless they’re not as bad as you might thing. They filled a niche in Soviet doctrine as a line holder. Basically this role was unchanged from WWII practice. Stick an MT-12 in a bush in the path of an attacking NATO force, tell the crew to hold fire to inside of ~1000m, and then go to town. This would free up a tank unit or AT infantry for their own forward operations. In the Soviet system tank&amp;infantry battalions ought to basically never stop advancing, so these AT guns were useful in a flank situation to check inevitable NATO counter attacks. 

Really they only fell out of fashion in the mid-80s, when it was obvious that an Abrams or Leo2 would not be bothered by that kind of gun. But by that point the Soviets had thousands of these things all less than 20 years old.

Anyway, most of the 700,000 troops aren't on any active front.  The number includes police and TDF forces (including the ones defending the non-active Russian border and non-front cities).  Plus, a lot of the new mobilized troops don't actually have the kit to join active combat.  

The actual number of troops Ukraine/Russia has on the southern front is unknown, but (especially recently) we've seen some complaints on the southern front from Russians that they have little in terms of support, since everything that can be spared is being shipped off to the Donbas.  Ukraine seems to also be dedicating most of its resources to the Donbas, which would explain why the southern front line has pretty much been frozen for 2 months now, despite being far less fortified than other areas.

Biden's administration called it that. Do they get a vote on definitions? Or only Reddit? 

&gt;Selling weapons is hardly enough grounds to warrant a response:

Selling Javelins=/=selling large inventory of anti-ship missiles intending to sink the Black Sea fleet. 

Biden already made it a point that the US is not conspiring with Ukraine to go after even single ships in the Russian Navy. Pretty hard to do that when we suddenly go out of our way to sink their whole fleet. 

&gt;The red line is direct military intervention. Boots on the ground

You're not POTUS and unless you are you don't decide what a Red Line is. 

The actual POTUS already decided on the Red Line when he made an overt effort to tell Russia we aren't going after their strategic assets. Sinking the Black Sea Fleet, necessary to lift the blockage, is a strategic asset.

&gt;If Putin were to order war with the US beforehand, there is no chance in hell that order actually leaves the Kremlin over, what, some missiles? Do you seriously think they would be willing to end the world in nuclear fire over that?

Back in mid February some guys in Moscow did the exact same thing you're doing now, suggesting the Ukrainians wouldn't dare respond to aggression. Wouldn't dare fight back. By being wrong they started a quagmire war that is killing their economy, turned them into an international pariah, and resulted in the destruction of their military grounds forces (probably over 30% are casualties at this point).

When your guess proves wrong you started WW3, that almost surely goes nuclear. All so you can avoid a peace deal...

&gt;Furthermore, giving away land in a peace deal merely encourages the Russians to try again in the future.

Russia has been punished already and will continue to be in the future, even if a peace deal happens to end this war, they are no getting off scot free. Again,  

""By being wrong they started a quagmire war that is killing their economy, turned them into an international pariah, and resulted in the destruction of their military grounds forces (probably over 30% are casualties at this point)""

Your warmongering utterly suicidal solution is to allow global instability or WW3 to occur so you can punish them further.

This is the part where it would be very easy to question someone's actual bravery because there is no risk to use a proxy to fight a Russia when they don't have to do it themselves. ""If you want Russian blood so badly, why don't you volunteer to fight in Ukraine? Last I checked they need foreign volunteers.""

Third, there is no American political party tied to the survival of any foreign nation state and it's borders besides Israel, not to Ukraine. Right now those on the Right who support the proxy war do so because much of the establishment Republican party like militant foreign policy, especially that keeps Russia in check. And because the current media zeitgeist is that it's un-American not to support Ukraine. But the former has largely been accomplished (Russia will take half a decade to recover from this war) and the latter changes when being un-American means pursuing war and global instability to continue funding a proxy war. 

 Right now there are no major negatives to supporting Ukraine. The isolationist faction on the Right is angry but the establishment Right get their votes because of gasoline prices and inflation, which they're already exploiting despite also siding with the cause that exacerbates those issues. IE they're already playing both sides of the table. Because politics is politics.

Honestly, this. 

Of course Russia's campaign in the Donbas is going (relatively) well, they've got local superiority in numbers, armor, aircraft, and artillery, they're throwing their best troops into the meatgrinder (VDV, Marines, Wagner, elite armored brigades), and they're attacking on an extremely narrow front. 

But can they really sustain this tempo and these losses for long? What happens when they need to take actual cities like Severodonetsk and Lyshansk, let alone Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipro? There's zero evidence those battle will go well or quickly for Russia, and they have the potential to sap their strength and momentum down to nothing. Plus Russia has already scraped the barrel for replacement equipment and trained soldiers, they're now lifting the age restrictions on contract servicemen in the hopes of reenlisting 40+ year old men. 

The number of Russian missile strikes is also decreasing, likely because they're running low on PGMs. They're even busting out Tochkas, despite pro-Russian commentators assuring everyone that only Ukraine uses those outdated munitions. Hell, T-62s are now being brought into Ukraine too, something they wouldn't be doing if they really had thousands of T-72s ready for deployment like they claimed. 

Where will the conflict be in 3 months when the Russians are increasingly running out of their best equipment and trained servicemen, while Ukraine continues to receive billions of dollars in Western military aid to equip brand new reserve brigades?",7580cd70d45d920aad4a49f9eb00a354e2be4b61,True,False,,,,,0,1653587427,,0,{},ia3c8hi,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t1_ia3ae25,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia3c8hi/,1653587444,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653558627.0,

[Tankograd does a nice breakdown](https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2020/12/soviet-towed-anti-tank-guns.html#t12-mt12), it also offers some insights into the Soviet production of anti-tank guns post WW2. Ukraine also operates some  made 125mm 2A45/2A45M anti-tank guns that fire the same ammunition as the T-64 and later tanks.

HEAT munitions became common in WW2 for which velocity makes no difference in regards to armor penetration, HESH became common as well. Recoilless rifles had been around to some extent since WW1, and were experimented with heavily in the interwar era. They became somewhat popular during WW2, and extensively popular post WW2. For most countries this was the death of the anti-tank gun, portable options were cheaper in every aspect and tactically more diverse. They still had the disadvantage of range and a longer time to impact. The SPG-9 recoilless rifle ended up as a hybrid to make up for this, firing a rocket propelled HEAT munition from a recoilless breech. The BMP-1's 73mm Grom fires the same ammunition with a smaller propellant charge from a closed breech, a ""low-pressure"" gun, again using the rocket assist to increase range and decrease time to impact.

As for modern day, the MT-12 is a modernization of the 1960s T-12. In the 1960s anti-tank guns were still somewhat common, but for the rest of the world that was end of it. The Soviets never retired their AT guns, but were kept as reserve units for dug defense. Partly because of limitations light AT weapons at the time, partly because of the cost to replace them with more modern systems. The MT-12 isn't rare in Russian service, I'm doubtful if very many are being used in this war however by Russia proper. Ukraine absorbed a large number of them after the fall of the USSR, and they aren't rare for Ukraine either. Plenty of videos out there from before the war of TDF units being trained on them.

You kind of answer it with yourself, but the lack of mobility in modern warfare is a huge aspect of it; fixed positions are artillery and airstrike magnets, so the ability to engage and displace is critical. On the modern battlefield, *if* you are able to effectively conceal your position from observation, best case you can get a few shots off before you're going to want to move. Additionally, the proliferation of increasingly low-cost ATGMs meant that there were just better options for the task. 

NATO block armies began phasing out dedicated towed AT platforms in favor of Tank Destroyers pretty quickly after WWII; a few towed platforms were developed and fielded in the 50's and 60's though. Traditional gun-equipped tank destroyers, in turn, began to be displaced almost entirely by ATGM platforms starting in the 60's and 70's.

The Russians largely followed the same timeline from a doctrinal standpoint; the MT12 was to me a weird artifact of soviet industry, where they would just keep on building a system at the same factory for years or even decades after it had become a bit obsolete. These guns could also fire non-AT, so they ended up largely being used as artillery (there is an HE-Frag shell).

And why has it seemingly been employed, but in such low numbers that only two are recorded lost when theoretically it should be a front-line, stationary target? Is it just that it's incredibly rare?

They are being employed largely because it is better than nothing; if TDF guys can conceal one and get a couple shots off on some BTR's or trucks that's not bad. But in the grand scheme of things, they are being used rarely precisely because they are generally useless.",e411113a6fa1857308f4406f937d6c5a7db2f6f9,True,False,,,,,0,1653585674,,0,{},ia37unv,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t1_ia2vn6l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia37unv/,1653585691,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653556874.0,

By Andrew E. KramerPhotographs by Ivor Prickett

Out on the riverbank, the scene of mayhem unfolded under a baking spring sun: blown-up tanks, the detritus of pontoon bridges, heaps of branches shorn off by explosions and the bodies of Russian soldiers, some half buried in the mud.

In the forest, a short walk revealed bits of torn Russian military uniforms hanging from trees, an eerie reminder of the troops who died violently here.

The failed river crossing that took place at this spot over several days in early May was one of the most lethal engagements of the war for the Russian army. Its forces had sought to surround Ukrainian soldiers in the nearby town of Sievierodonetsk — but instead became surrounded themselves, boxed in by the river and a Ukrainian frontline. At least 400 Russian soldiers died, mostly from artillery attacks.

As the war grinds across the rolling plains and forests of Eastern Ukraine, the maneuvering of troops has in large part evolved into attempts at entrapment. But as the deadly encounter at the bridge illustrated, the tactic comes with grave risks.

After failing to capture major cities such as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or to cleave off the entire Black Sea coast, the Russian military attempted a major encirclement of Ukrainian troops in the east. That effort is looking difficult now that Ukraine has blocked one main route of advance, near the town of Izium.

So the Russian forces’ immediate goal has become a smaller encirclement of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city in the Donbas region still under Ukrainian control. Artillery bombardments by Russian troops approaching from three sides have ravaged the city, knocking out water and electricity and in the past day killing at least six people.

The Russian strategy has been to use the blunt instrument of its army’s vast artillery to pound away at Ukrainian forces, making incremental gains in the Luhansk region of the Donbas. Military analysts and Western intelligence officials believe that Moscow’s forces would face brutal urban combat if they tried to fully capture Sievierodonetsk, and that they would struggle to mount an offensive deeper inside Ukraine.

Encirclement is a harrowing prospect for soldiers.

“I try not to think about it,” said Pvt. Ivan Sichkar, a Ukrainian soldier surveying the destruction of the encircled Russian force. “If I think of being surrounded, there’s no time left to do anything else.”

The Russians’ refashioned goal has focused the battle on a slender, 75-mile front in the Donbas. It is seeking to advance from both the north and the south to close the one remaining supply line for Ukraine into the city of Sievierodonetsk.

On Tuesday, the Russian army advanced from the south, forcing Ukrainian troops to retreat from the small town of Svitlodarsk, lest the Russians envelop the town and trap soldiers inside. And in its Wednesday evening briefing, the Ukrainian general staff described stepped-up attacks by Russian helicopters and jets to support ground troops in the east.

With Russia making only halting progress in Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin moved Wednesday to shore up support at home, announcing raises in pensions and the minimum wage and making his first trip to meet with wounded soldiers. “They are all heroes,” he said at a military hospital.

Mr. Putin also signed a decree opening a fast track to Russian citizenship for Ukrainian residents of areas controlled by the Russian military, a further step toward annexing territory in southeastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied.

As Mr. Putin moved to reassure ordinary Russians, Ukraine’s Western allies were trying to maintain pressure on his government. In Ankara on Wednesday, talks took place between Turkey, Finland and Sweden over Turkish concerns about the two Nordic countries’ application to join NATO. At a news conference after five hours of negotiations, Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said more talks were needed.

“Turkey is not under time pressure,” Mr. Kalin said. “It is not possible for any process to proceed without meeting the security concerns of Turkey.”

The strategy of encirclement has yielded far-reaching political gains for Russia over the course of its longer conflict in the region, in which Russian-backed separatists battled Ukrainian forces for eight years before the full-scale invasion this year. Two cease-fires, known as the Minsk agreements and seen as struck on terms advantageous to Russia, followed successful Russian encirclements of Ukrainian troops in the east in 2014 and 2015.

But in Bilohorivka, a tiny coal mining town on the banks of the Siversky Donets River, the tables were turned earlier this month, at least temporarily slowing the Russian advance.

Ukrainian soldiers who fought in the battle took to calling the site “the ear” for a lobe-like loop in the river where the fiercest fighting took place. The Ukrainian military escorted reporters for The New York Times to the site, which is on a frontline formed in much of the Donbas region by the roiling, fast-flowing river, swollen by spring rain.

Sunlight filters through the foliage of a dense, quiet forest on the river’s floodplain, which was the Ukrainians’ kill zone. Mosquitoes buzz. In places, the smell of decaying corpses is overwhelming.

“The Russian bodies start here,” Private Sichkar said as he rounded a bend in a dirt road extending about mile through the forest to the river’s edge. Just in this one spot, 15 incinerated armored personnel carriers were scattered about.

“The Russians wanted some little victory,” Col. Dmytro  Kashchenko, the Ukrainian officer who commanded the counterattack on the pontoon bridge, said in an interview. “They tried in Kyiv, they tried in Kharkiv, and they lost. They were trying to win at least something.”

The Siversky Donets River, which cuts a meandering path through eastern Ukraine, forms a natural barrier to Russia’s advances. Suitable sites for pontoon crossings are few, Colonel Kashchenko said.

Russia’s economy. Russia’s central bank cut interest rates again, in the latest effort by Moscow to try to stabilize its economy, which has been harmed by sanctions and months of fighting in Ukraine. The move came as President Vladimir V. Putin promised to increase the minimum wage and military benefits.

Russian oil ban. The European Union has stalled on its proposed ban on Russian oil. The measure is being held up by Hungary’s refusal to back the embargo, claiming it would devastate the country’s economy.

On the ground. Moscow’s military has narrowed its focus to a 75-mile-wide sliver of land in the heart of the eastern Donbas region, which has allowed Russian forces to make incremental gains. Russia’s main immediate target remains Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city still under Ukrainian control.

He was ordered to one of the crossings on May 8, after the Russians deployed pontoons and moved soldiers into the forest on the near bank. Ukrainian infantry advanced into the area the next day, but were repulsed, suffering losses, he said.

They then set up a defensive line to box in the Russians as they crossed their pontoon bridge, and rained down artillery fire on the area. They also set about destroying the bridge by placing floating mines upstream, allowing the current to carry them to the Russians’ pontoons, which proved an effective tactic. The Ukrainian forces blew up four separate bridges at the crossing site.

The Russians hastily laid new pontoons and sent armored vehicles across, Colonel Kashchenko said, but they were unable to break through the Ukrainian defensive line. Dozens of armored vehicles and infantry soldiers became trapped and were mauled by Ukrainian artillery. The Ukrainians also hit Russian troops involved in the bridge work on the far shore.

The bombardment included some of the first barrages from a newly arrived American artillery gun, the M777, Colonel Kashchenko said.

Colonel Kashchenko said he had offered the enemy forces a chance to surrender, shouting into a loudspeaker, “‘Russians, give up!’” But, he said, “I don’t know if they heard us.”

Some enemy soldiers escaped by swimming across the river, the Ukrainians said. The Ukrainians have yet to collect the remains of the Russians scattered around the forest.

In the mottled light sifting through the leaves, discarded food and personal items lay all about: a sleeping bag, bottles of shower gel, cans of beef, a bag of potatoes, Russian tea bags, flip-flop sandals.

Ukrainian soldiers found a certificate for a medal granted to a Russian colonel for earlier fighting in the war. It was called an “award for military excellence.”

Beside a disabled Russian tank lay a cardboard box apparently used for carrying supplies. On the box was an odd message for a unit in war: “Always believe something wonderful is about to happen.”

Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, former supreme allied commander in Europe, drew a distinction between the Ukrainian tactics of seeking to target Russian armored vehicles and troops with artillery and the Russian bombardments of towns and cities.

“In the big scheme of things, Ukraine is trying to do maneuver warfare to regain territory and cut off resupply routes,” General Breedlove said. “And Russia is doing more of a grinding, attrition-based warfare.”

Of Russia’s bungled pontoon crossing, he said, “the Russians did something poorly that is difficult even if you do it magnificently.”",4b0b029f36e80c29cc220e639be41dedb7b25e94,True,False,,,,,0,1653585315,,0,{},ia36xvs,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,True,t3_uy5zcd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia36xvs/,1653585332,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653556515.0,

Right now we won't even give them MLRS for fear they'll fire them into Belgorod or other targets inside Russia itself. Biden obviously fears the escalation of a proxy war into a shooting war, into WW3 that goes nuclear.

this is part of the report from the Institute for the Study of War (very pro Ukranian but gives detailed info of the battle field) 

""Russian forces prioritized three advances east and west of Popasna in an effort to cut Ukrainian GLOCs southwest of Severodonetsk and complete the Luhansk Oblast cauldron. Russian forces continued to advance east of Popasna to seize settlements on the T1303 highway to Lysyschansk, northeast to cut Ukrainian access to T1302 highway from Bakhmut to Lysychansk, and southwest along the T0504 highway from Popasna toward Bakhmut.\[14\] Russian forces reportedly made advances towards Bakhmut from Svitlodarsk, a settlement just north of Debaltseve, and continued heavy shelling likely in preparations for a ground offensive.\[15\]  
  
Russian forces seem to be prioritizing efforts to cut the two highways to Severodonetsk over launching offensive operations on Bakhmut at this time.\[16\] Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai refuted reports that Russian forces had cut off or blocked the T1302 highway on May 25.\[17\] Russian forces are unlikely to completely isolate Ukrainian forces from GLOCs just by seizing the southwestern T1303 and T1302 highways to Severodonetsk given the network of alternate if smaller roads in the region and will need to block or disrupt Bakhmut and Siversk to complete the Luhansk cauldron.  
  
Russian efforts to isolate Severodonetsk and Lysychansk may not be well synchronized in time and space with an impending direct Russian assault on Severdonetsk, although it is too soon to tell. The Russians are likely some days away from even cutting off the GLOCs to Severdonetsk and Lysychansk, and it would likely take some time for the disruption of those GLOCs to affect the cities’ defenders’ abilities to continue fighting. The intensity of Russian artillery and air attack, however, combined with the massing of Russian forces drawn from elsewhere in theater for the assault on Severodonetsk suggests that the assault could be launched before the GLOCs have been cut or before their disruption could have a material effect. The drive to cut the GLOCs could also be an effort to create an outer encirclement ring, however, to prevent Ukrainian forces from attempting to reinforce Severodonetsk as it is attacked or to relieve it if it is isolated or falls.""",c0726b061445494388b09f90746f069d2137f537,True,False,,,,,0,1653584199,,0,{},ia3442n,False,t3_uxwg8c,False,True,t1_ia2kmik,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxwg8c/the_battlefields_of_the_donbass_and_beyond/ia3442n/,1653584217,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653555399.0,

Losing a few oblasts to Russia is a terrible price to pay but it's better than the alternative that we all considered only a few months ago. After all, they weren't conquered, that won't happen at this point. Zelensky is still in power, most of Ukraine will remain intact. Putin might even give up part of what they've conquered. Who knows?

The alternative to peace now is toughing out the food crisis for the years and years it takes an ever weakening Ukraine to bleed itself white conducting bloody ground counter-offensives to try to retake its old borders, which in all fairness to the military reality, they might never be able to achieve.

------------------

&gt; * Russia's eight attacks make the Zatoka bridge one of the most frequently attacked fixed targets. By the time it was cut, the initial reason for the effort had been forgotten.

&gt; * The Russian effort to destroy the Zatoka bridge harkens back to an earlier U.S. struggle to destroy the Thanh Hoa bridge in North Vietnam, 70 miles south of Hanoi. 

&gt; * For the United States, the saga of the Than Hoa bridge became the story of modern air warfare. The U.S. did not possess an accurate enough weapon with a large enough explosive yield to destroy priority targets. As a result of the frustrating effort to destroy the bridge, a series of new weapons with more explosives and better guidance were developed. ""Single-shot kill"" became the new mantra. By Desert Storm, seven percent of the bombs dropped were precision-guided (compared to less than one percent in Vietnam). By the air war over Kosovo in 1999, new (and cheap) satellite-guided bombs accounted for 35 percent of weapons used. By Iraq in 2003, nearly 70 percent of the munitions dropped were guided.

&gt; * Long-range cruise missiles were also developed parallel with smart bombs, becoming the modern day weapon of choice for sensitive American attacks, even as the cost (at over $1 million per missile) has limited their use. Over 32 years, some 2,300 Tomahawks have been used in combat

&gt; * That's about how many Russian missiles have been used in 85 days of strikes (2,275 missiles have been successfully launched as of May 23), an expensive and dubious undertaking for Moscow. 

&gt; * Whether Russia's vulnerability to Ukrainian air defenses is responsible for Moscow's reliance on these (similarly expensive) long-range missiles, or it is more in the nature of Russian culture to use flying artillery, is still open to question.

&gt; * Though Russia has dropped dumb bombs in Ukraine, and has fired some laser-guided munitions, the preponderance of what it has fired beyond the battlefield are missiles.

&gt; * ""If you look at the launches overall, we are talking well under half of all Russian missiles hitting their aim points,"" says a senior Defense Intelligence Agency official who is working on the war. The official, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive information, says that two to three out of every ten missiles fired fail to launch or fizzle during its flight. Two more have technical problems such as not fusing properly even if they fly to their intended range. Two to three more miss their aim-points even when they reach their intended target.""Right now, we're holding Russian missile success at just below 40 percent,"" the DIA official says.

&gt; * Ukraine says that it has shot down 110 Russian cruise missiles, almost 10 percent of those that make it into Ukrainian airspace.

&gt; * ""And then there's the question of what they [the Russians] are hitting, and what their intentions are even when they do succeed,"" the DIA official adds. ""For a couple of days it's airfields and air defenses. Then the emphasis shifts to ammunition depots, then oil, then factories, then the transportation grid. In each case, we are not seeing effective attacks and we are seeing little if any follow-on strikes.""

&gt; * The implications for the future are important. Are 1,000-mile range missiles the cutting edge of future wars, indeed where ""single shot"" accuracy and reliability puts virtually every target at risk, where control of the skies diminishes in importance?

&gt; * ...will a future Chinese adversary effectively be able to use its even more extensive inventory of missiles to strike at long distances and achieve desired effects?

Oryx has listed 2 MT12 Anti-Tank Guns on their document, one destroyed and one captured. Wikipedia said this entered into service in the 1960s, and has this to say about its combat ability in the modern battlefield:

""During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukrainian forces are using this weapon against Russian armour in the South and the Eastern of Ukraine. Although not capable of destroying modern tanks it can disable it or even destroy it from certain angles, it can also destroy lighter armoured vehicles. It is readily available and it is being used by Ukrainian Territorial Units made up of older citizens. Pro-Russian separatists have also been seen using these weapons. It provides direct fire support for units that don't have 2S1 122-millimeter howitzer or Stugna-P missiles.""

When did towed anti-tank weapons fall out of favor? Are they simply too slow, stationary, and expensive/manpower intensive compared to man-packed anti tank weapons, ATGMs, and the speed of modern armor?

&gt; Our review of will-to- fight related literature, our interviews with organizational military leaders and experts, and our case study examinations showed that the most important aspect of organiza- tional integrity for will-to-fight considerations is corruption.117 Corruption can have a profound impact on individual perceptions of the organization and their willingness to fight for it over time.

So when I saw this article about corruption I was attracted to it. Could it be that the corruption and rot of the Russian society has filtered down to ruin the morale of the common Russian soldier fighting in Ukraine? And I wonder about corruption in Ukraine as well, as it has long struggled with corruption as a major impediment to economic investment. Will this eventually weaken the Ukrainian armed forces or will the new found patriotism inspire a clean up effort in the country. 

-------------------------

&gt; * The Russian army’s corruption is reflected in ironic ways. On 7 April, Ukraine announced that it had destroyed one of the Russian army’s latest Orlan-10 drones in Donetsk. Out of curiosity, a Ukrainian soldier disassembled the US$100,000 drone and found that the fuel cap was replaced by a bottle top, while a Canon DSLR camera was secured to the drone with duct tape and glue. When the soldier reported this to his superiors over the phone, they were in utter disbelief until they saw the photos and videos for themselves.

&gt; * In October 2019, General Khalil Arslanov, then chief of the Main Communications Directorate of the Russian army, conspired with suppliers to embezzle at least 6.7 billion rubles (approx. US$100 million) during the contracting stage of projects involving military communication equipment.

&gt; * In January 2020, the media reported that Putin personally ordered the removal of five high-ranking military or military-adjacent officials, involving Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, Investigative Committee and Ministry of Emergency Situations. This was the fourth time Russia removed high-ranking officials since 2019, marking a total of more than 20 senior generals, nearly all of which were accused of corruption.

&gt; * Dawisha wrote that Putin “built a system based on massive predation on a level not seen in Russia since the tsars”. Transparency International estimates the annual cost of bribery to Russia at US$300 billion, roughly equal to Denmark’s GDP, or 37 times higher than what Russia spent on healthcare, education and agriculture in 2007. She added that Western bank coffers swelled due to the capital flight, which has totalled approximately US$335 billion since 2005, or about 5% of Russia’s GDP, reaching over US$50 billion in the first quarter of 2014 alone.

&gt; * Putin built a legalistic system, but this system only serves to “control, channel and coerce the middle class and the broader elite” while at the same time allowing the inner core to act with impunity along what has been called Putin’s “vertical of power”.

Grain was planted... in most places it is planted in the fall and harvested in the next year. So yes, you can see in many of the videos coming out of SE Ukraine that the fields are full of young plants right now.  


Also, the area that is actively being fought over right now is relatively small compared to the whole country. Other than the area maybe within 50 km of the front (just guessing but you get the idea), everywhere else in Russia and Ukraine is being farmed. The problem isn't necessarily the physical area not being farmed, its that Russia is blocking exports.   


But to your point, yes, the current grain being grown would not have an effect on the food supply this year. Those areas that would be harvested this year would be shipped later this year and even next year, so that grain is going to have more of an effect next year.

He's worried about Putin being pushed over the edge and murdering EVERYONE. Ww3 is not a solution to out current problems.

First of all Ukraine has a post-Soviet military that’s set up to use Soviet planes. NATO countries do not have many functional MiGs or Sukhois to give in the first place, and I’m pretty sure they already gave them what they had. 

This is a problem for a couple reasons: 1) no Ukrainian pilots that are already trained to fly Western fighter aircraft; 2) maintenance and logistics would become very complicated or impossible for the Ukrainians to do unless the Western powers supplied all spare parts and deployed personnel or contractors to carry out the maintenance; 3) the UAF is very weak compared to the RuAF and so it’s not just a question of tipping the scales here and there, it would have to be a large-scale, long-lasting, extremely expensive program just for the UAF to achieve parity let alone air dominance; 4) in terms of opportunity cost there are many, many things that the Western powers could do that would be simultaneously less expensive and more strategically significant than providing planes at this time. 

Obviously the Ukraine situation is very different than the Afghanistan situation but the attempt to build an Afghani Air Force ran into a lot of problems, mostly related to maintenance and logistics. They were given multiple different types of airframes, none of which they could service or maintain themselves with the sole exception of their small fleet of Soviet manufactured MI-35 Hind helicopters. They were nearly 100% dependent on Western contractors to keep their Air Force functional. As soon as the US military pulled out, so too did the contractors and the Afghani Air Force collapsed. 

This inevitable dependency on Western contractors or personnel would be problematic in Ukraine. Either the maintenance people would have to be stationed in Poland or Romania (in which case the UAF would have to transport planes over 1,000 km away from the front if they wanted to do maintenance), or they would be stationed in Ukraine which means NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine directly aiding the war effort, something that NATO political leadership is unwilling to do.",fa11033267def79b95815a79937afd25280617cd,True,False,,,,,0,1653572975,,0,{},ia2cgsj,False,t3_uy5zcd,False,False,t1_ia27656,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_26_2022/ia2cgsj/,1653572989,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653544175.0,

&gt; I disagree, fundamentally. If a government has passed laws forbidding protests, it means they are no longer interested in being a democracy. That’s exactly the time to take to the streets.

Protest is fine. Violent protest? Not so much. Democracy is about having a voice and sharing that voice, not enforcing your will through violent means.

FWIW I actually looked up the anti protest laws and they're not *that* different from recent legislation in the UK. I didn't see anyone taking to the streets at all here, even if it would have been justified.

&gt; We do know what was in Medvedev’s head, and it was “kill the protestors or we cut you off economically” which is the message he gave to Yankovich.

Well that's not exactly what he said, but strongman advocating strongman tactics isn't exactly crazy.

Also Russia had just provided Ukraine with significant financial assistance in order to 'direct' UA policy. It's no surprise that the assistance was dependent on UA maintaining said policy... that the protestors wanted to scrap.

&gt; Perhaps, but these events did pave the way for a Ukraine that is democratic. Zelensky had rock bottom approval, but international observers noted the election was fair.

The yanukovych election was fair too! That's the problem. In western media he's portrayed as some illegitimate russian puppet (that's what i believed anyway), but he won a free and fair democratic election (as much as they can be un UA).

The problem is more that politics is dominated by oligarchs who own their own all the TV stations and dictate public sentiment (zelensky was also backed by a media-owning oligarch).

&gt; I think the phone conversation is exaggerated. My take, having read the transcript was it was more “who are the possible people who will take over, and which one is likely to be friendlist to the US?” which is a conversation diplomatics have all the time in these situations. I don’t get any indication they were at all able to “pick” a leader like post WW2 Japan.

I agree to an extent. The implication wasn't that they were controlling everything, but very much that they were fundamentally involved and 'facilitating' an outcome that suited them.

&gt; As for speeches, fine, whatever. Given that the Russians absolutely use undeclared state actors and bot farms to influence nutjobs in the US, I would be absolutely ecstatic if instead Russian politicians gave speeches about overthrowing the government. That way there is 0 confusion over where the message is coming from.

Ehh. I don't really believe that tbh. Go back to 2012 and obama invited all the *russian* opposition candidates to a meeting at the US embassy in Moscow to seemingly discuss how they were going to 'make russia better' (i.e. remove putin). The inherent problem with believing you're the good guys is that you believe that even the most blatant disregard for norms is ok as you don't even realise it's problematic.

&gt; However, we can’t get sucked into “whataboutism” or attempting moral equivalency. Particularly in the case where the one side is doing this things at a significantly greater rate and on a considerably larger scale than the other. 

It's not about whataboutism really. To me it's about understanding *how we got to where we are* and how rhetoric/bias/reporting influences our perceptions. In the modern age people don't just go crazy and invade foreign countries due to base desire for conquest. It's almost criminally reductive to present things as such. Where we are is a culmination of 150 years of cultural, political and military events. One side may well be very much in the wrong from a basic moral/ legal standpoint, but from an IR/ geopolitical perspective the entire conflict is fifty shades of grey. Unfortunately in the real world it's the latter that matters, because all that is happening is in the IR/geopolitical realm, not the realm of personal morality. *Obviously* fuck putin. He's not a good person, and from my perspective he's standing in the way of liberal democratic 'freedom' for the russian people. The problem is I would think that, because that is my cultural perspective. And that is problematic in itself.

This war and the rhetoric surrounding it (apparently international law... matters? apparently war crimes... matter? so long as you're not *us*) has caused me to reflect extremely hard on my own preconceptions and biases. Over the past few years i've also developed a fascination with how narratives dominate our understanding of issues, even if the narratives don't reflect reality at all (Boris' entire governing style is about setting narratives regardless what reality/policy actually exists). To hugely oversimplify my broad conclusions, the way we interpret different events is not fair, measured or objective, but basically amounts to 'we're the good guys' and everyone else isn't ('we' being those of the 'liberal democratic' western order). We are essentially a collective cult - no different in practice to islamists - who feel the need to impose our 'superior' moral beliefs and ideals on others and see everyone else as a threat. Not only does it make us extremely open to manipulation ('pls help. we want to be good guys like you'), but it makes conflict inevitable and means that we cannot perceive ourselves to do wrong.

If yanukovych had been pro western and the maidan protestors were demanding an economic treaty with russia.... what do you think the western response would have been? There would have been open outrage.

If Russia (in an alternate universe) did to ukrainian speakers in law what ukraine has done to russian speakers what do you think the western response would be? There'd be widespread cries of genocide as has become so very popular in the last few years. Instead it's dismissed as 'a russian talking point' and 'kremlin propaganda'... despite the laws being openly available to read online.

Essentially my thought process is to say 'well how would we interpret this from the other perspective, or if the roles were reversed'. My conclusion is that we would care about basically none of the causes of 'international outrage'

&gt; I constantly see people trying to use complaints about Ukraine’s corruption or individual instances of POW mistreatment as evidence that they are “just as bad” as the russians. It’s a distraction that allows key elements (e.g. one person is doing the invading, the other is being invaded) to disappear from the discussion.

All my above is basically to say that were we in Russia's shoes, I think we would have invaded ukraine too. And we'd be fully supportive of the invasion domestically imo. Moral quandaries are as ever at the centre of public debate, but that's only really because it's in our perceived interests for them to be so. Alas moral arguments are only as valid as their framing and our own perceptions. Things which are entirely subjective. You cannot get a grasp of an issue by thinking in terms of who is good and who is bad, because it immediately informs how you interpret every aspect of a debate. We interpret things that are morally wrong as morally good and vice versa because it fits with our idealistic worldview.

Surely this should be obvious to people who have witnessed the partisanship of the last few years domestically? Why don't we apply the same thinking to foreign events. The people who believed the rittenhouse trial (a shocking indictment of US gun culture, but a fair trial and ruling) was a big conspiracy were just as delusional as those who thought the election was rigged. Essentially so long as we see 'others' as a threat rather than just people who we disagree with, this will continue.

Extreme nationalists in Russia = Bad. Extreme nationalists in Ukraine = Good. Only meaningful difference is that we want to use the latter to harm the former for our own geostrategic aims.

Are a group of rebels terrorists or freedom fighters? Doesn't really matter. All that matters is if they suit our geostrategic goals and we can frame them however we want whilst the public lap it up. A lot of the time they go from one to the other and maybe even back again!

Are you seeing a pattern? It's not even necessarily due to conscious decisions (le big western conspiracy). It's as a consequence of our own subconscious belief in our own collective moral superiority and the resultant crusade-like *need* to 'spread the good word'. If something is in our interests then it's inherently good as it benefits us, the good guys. I think we essentially live in a delusional reality. It doesn't help that most in the west are entirely ignorant as to how the rest of the world functions either.

&gt; At any rate, it was interesting to see your thoughts on this, so thank you for taking a good faith effort to expand on what you were thinking and outline how you see events. I think this produces much better discussion than trading accusations.

Likewise.

It's tiresome being dismissed as a shill or conspiracist. The problem is that it's a complex topic and it's very difficult to properly lay out my detailed thoughts on the topic. In a sense I guess my position essentially demands that others confront their entire worldview, which as we both know is not something that anyone does lightly.

There are stories about certain international affairs that I know for a fact (from real world experience) to be entirely baseless and yet they get parroted around the global news system and provoke western outrage everywhere. I've tried debunking them, but nobody cares to listen.

WW1 beyond 'the front' nobody was really in any danger of attack. the trench stalemate could be maintained whilst the rest of the country kept on doing its thing.

WW2 the only people that didn't capitulate were the UK who was never actually under threat of invasion and the USSR who despite taking serious casualties could rely on tried and tested attrition of the enemy and their enormous resource/manpower base (along with western supplies). Only 8.7% of soviet territory was actually occupied, but even then they were potentially on the brink of capitulation had they lost at stalingrad.

[],False,,chowieuk,,,[],,,,text,t2_b230l,False,False,"&gt; Some people really seem to underestimate nation's will to fight. That applies to both Ukraine and Russia.

Nationalism is (I'll say again) a hell of a drug.

It depends on loads of different things though. Messaging/rhetoric/propaganda plays a huge role, and tbh the people on both sides have had 8 years of escalating tensions fomenting strongly held beliefs. 

It's also very easy for people in for example western Ukraine or Russia to say 'yeah let's keep fighting' given they haven't really seen much of anything in terms of consequences. Fortunately calls for peace (if they exist) aren't about those people though.

&gt; &gt; I have a feeling this thinking that Ukraine (or Russia) would want to end the war after they lose a couple dozen thousand lives, stems from some ""degenerate"" western convenience standpoint. That once my monthly mortgage payment goes up by 20 Euros my will to fight disappears.

I like to think that were I Ukrainian I'd want to flee rather than giving my life for 'the cause', but it's impossible to know how you'd actually react in that scenario. It's quite interesting to compare the policies of actively arming the population and refusing to let men leave the country and how that factors into things too. In other conflicts there are often a lot of male refugees leaving too, because they have no interest in sacrificing their lives for the whims of demagogues fighting over territory. That every family still has some 'living connection' to the conflict rather than just material has presumably changed the calculation one way or the other.

There's always been a common (ignorant) misconception in the west when discussing issues such as immigration and refugees - that people willingly abandon their homeland and everything they know and possess because 'well the west is better lol'. I've mentioned it before, but people have almost irrational attachment to both territory and what they know/ are familiar with. Upping sticks is *never* an easy decision. I remember teaching a bunch of romanian kids, and despite almost all of them dreaming about working/studying abroad for better opportunities, they all wanted to return home and improve their own country in the longer term.

&gt; What it means when your enemy desires your extinction.

Even if the aim is to 'remove ukraine from the map', that's vastly different to 'exterminating all ukrainians'.

Japan, since their modernization, played the limited war game very well... until they overplayed their hand and were destroyed. 

Japan employed the strategy of a limited war, in which Japan would strike quickly at the enemies (China in the 1890s, Russia in 1904, China again in 1931), grab the land they intend seize, inflict a tactical military defeat on the enemy, dig in and make the enemy lose hope of retaking the land. Thus leading to a peace deal in which Japan gets what it wants, without the war spiraling out into a long total war of attrition, that Japan fundamentally can not win.

Japan hoped they could do the same with USA in 1941. Strike hard, grab all the territory they wanted, dig in and make it impractical for USA to retake those territories.

Especially after we saw the US's experience in vietnam, along with wars like ww2 and ww1. Even though the current military situation has slowed considerably, it is still not the same situation as the war in donbass. That situation was a more local war where people actually HAD alternatives in Ukraine. They still had jobs and no city outside of the donbass and crimea was under threat.  Ukraine is still in a state of total war right now, and that doesn't look to change anytime soon. Most people aren't going back to their former lifestyle just because Kyiv is not longer under threat. Businesses and infrastructure continue to get destroyed. Millions of women, children, and elderly are still displaced outside of Ukraine. 

The closest equivalent to the war today is probably the 2nd Sino-Japanese war. That war was also preceded by Japan's piecemeal conquest of chinese land. The Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931 and took it with very little trouble because of internal divisions within China. Over the next few years, Japan continued to grab land in inner mongolia until the situation stabilized outside the great wall in the lead up to 1937. Then in 1937, an escalation by the Japanese army at the Marco polo bridge lead to the Japanese conquest of Tianjin and Beijing. This started the larger war in which Japan invaded from the north and south. Japan took Shanghai and Nanjing within the first few months (but the conquest was also a lot slower than the Japanese had hoped). The Japanese also tried to end the war right there by calling for the Chinese to just accept the new reality and end hostilities (sound familiar?) But the chinese never surrendered despite losing territory well into 1944. 

That war got as bad as it can get. Millions of citizens died from lack of food and atrocities, and millions even collaborated with the Japanese. But even with that situation, the majority still wanted to fight on, even with china's inability to counterattack against the Japanese. We see the same pattern here. Both wars transformed from a local war into an invasion of the whole country, and the Chinese political division at that time was FAR worse than the Ukrainian one. The Russians attacking everywhere and invading into Kherson, Kharkiv, and Kyiv sends the exact message that this is a war of conquest and cultural extermination.  Will local factors impact morale to some degree? probably.

&gt; The human factor that was missed was those in the US govt who years before made a series of strategic decisions culminating in an unfavorable outcome that was destined to occur, then being upset it happened faster than they hoped.

Report says:

&gt;The case of the Vietnam War shows that even accurate intelligence analyses of will to fight are meaningless if they are ignored by decisionmakers.

(Page 20)

More fundamentally, you say in a different comment:

&gt;I am in 100% agreement in the power of the human factor in warfare, which is why I personally lean towards military science actually being military art, because it isn't actually scientific or quantifiable. AKA, so much of the math involved in all of this is pure bullshit, at least IMO.

Report says:

&gt;In a published 2012 RAND report, the lead author of this study made a detailed  
argument that **in war nearly all seemingly objective and quantifiable information masked extensive subjectivity and qualitative analysis**.116 *No method or type of information is inherently better than another in the study of war*

(Page 32, bold emphasis added, italic emphasis in original)

Far from claiming to crunch numbers to see the future, the proposed model of will to fight is introduced this way:

&gt;A useful model approximates reality and gives people a tool for thinking through complex problems and, in some cases, understanding systems. Simpler and more concrete problems and systems are easier to model with convincing realism. Tangible systems like trucks and weapons can be modeled with great accuracy. But any model of will to fight will be far less accurate or precise than any technical model: **Integrating individual motivations and behavior, units, culture, and combat defies precision and accuracy. Even without replicable accuracy, though, a model of will to fight can be very useful.** More importantly, a model is needed to serve as a baseline for effective assessment, analysis, estimation, forecasting, and influence.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The model is explanatory rather than explicit because will to fight can be assessed but not measured: As we argued in the previous chapter, **will to fight is a factor of war that fundamentally defies accurate and precise quantification**

The point of a model like this shouldn't be to say ""ok, we've cranked numbers and side X is going to win."" To the contrary, what the model does is say that you *can't* just do a simplistic quantitative analysis (""Side X has Y number of tanks and Side Z has AA number of tanks, so Side X will win""). Instead, there's numerous qualitative factors that you have to consider, and you will never have an accurate and precise quantification of will to fight and, therefore, likelihood of success in war.

Not necessarily saying their model is correct or valuable--just that what they are saying and what you are saying are fundamentally aligned far, far more than they are opposed.",ae22475ed966110f1caf4faf04dadab53ad5e0fb,True,False,,,,,0,1653552989,,0,{},ia1igb8,False,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9yckax,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/ia1igb8/,1653553005,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653524189.0,

Ukraine retaking land is good and I hope they retake as much as possible, but that is not what will change future risk of a new military adventure by Russia. 

What will change that risk is the destruction of Russian military power. However, there's no realistic scenario in which Ukraine crushes the Russian army to its last man and forces Moscow to give up its nukes or else the UA will take the kremlin, so it comes down to defining what what loss level we can consider the Russian threat realistically neutralised.

For some reason, a lot of people seem to equate that point with some arbitrary amount of land retaken, which again, makes no sense. 

On the other hand, we can argue that Ukraine needs to frustrate enough of Russian goals to make the future political prospect of a new adventure unfavourable. In that regard, retaking territory does matter and personally I find it difficult to argue that with how bold Russian goals were, this war will already be considered anything but a huge failure back in Russia. 

If we want to be extra careful about making this a political failure (we should) than taking back Kherson and preventing the Russians from holding onto the land bridge would certainly do it. If all they get for the cost of their military becoming destroyed for at least a decade is the Donbas, they ain't coming back any soon.

To sum it up, I'm not saying Zelenski should take ant deal tomorrow. I'm just saying every war ends in a deal (surrender is also a deal) so saying Ukraine must win or else Moscow will be back in 5 years might sound nice but it is not really useful since it doesn't define what is winning.

Russia only stops fighting in the near term if Putin is deposed, the economy collapses, or battlefield defeats become too embarrassing that it's better to declare victory and withdraw.

All the above scenarios are possible though I don't think likely in 2022.

I don’t know what this snide remark is even supposed to mean. I hope you don’t think I’m some democratic partisan because I said some mean words about American republicans 

I have complete and utter contempt for the American political system and modern American political discourse, and both American political parties are corrupt and ineffectual in ways that manifest differently from each other. I don’t lead off with every critique of one of the parties with “well first off the other side is just as bad” because that gets extremely tedious after a while

Regardless of how those corruptions manifest, the net result is a political apparatus that is unable to think strategically or plan more than 4 years in advance, and it’s a huge part of the reason this crisis in Ukraine is as bad as it is. 

And I saw you wrote this down below, and it really gives the game away 

&gt; As if Redditors in major subs have ever interacted with Republicans in real life, rather than forming their worldview exclusively through mainstream and social media content.

So I’m assuming either you several of your friends or family are Republican voters or vocally conservative or whatever. I currently live in and grew up in a deep red state, and almost all of my family votes red and always has, as do a large portion of my coworkers. You know what issues of the day they care about? They hear too much Spanish at the grocery store now, one of the cousins came out as gay, there’s too many black people on TV, and a football player kneeled during the anthem that one time, and all of that shit really pisses them off. That’s it, it’s just unfocused anger. 

I don’t give a shit if it hurts their feelings or yours. The state of political discourse in this country is genuinely embarrassing, and there is absolutely no reason to sit around pretending like large numbers of Americans have an ideologically coherent and principled critique of the way things are. Everyone is alienated and detached from everyone else, and opportunistic political operators swoop in to exploit that vague and unfocused dissatisfaction for personal gain.",49f698f9f8495e6f77f3bcb36ad4109920344430,True,False,,,,,0,1653535088,,0,{},ia0tky6,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_ia0pa90,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/ia0tky6/,1653535099,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653506288.0,

Not intentional, not through incompetence, but because there was a reason Active Defense was replaced by AirLand Battle only a few years after it was released. Because those pesky fresh reserves and second echelon OMG who in every field exercise or computer simulation was able to break through the defenses that had held against the previous attacks while being battered along the way, taking losses, using up ammo that hadn't been replaced, losing access to their best primary fighting positions, who can't hold forever. What needs to happen is the weakened defenses need to be relieved regularly (not easy in the midst of battle) and/or they need to target the second echelon threat behind the front lines so the ground defenses don't need to fight them at al. Which is what AirLand Battle was all about: deep air support/air interdiction of the rear to target those massive columns (like the ""40 mile"" convoy north of Kyiv that the Ukrainians couldn't destroy but the USAF specializes in destroying), large scale assembly areas, etc, all defended by ADA that friendly air has to defeat too (requiring high levels of proficiency in SEAD/DEAD).

I *really* doubt the Ukrainians could possibly have put together an Air Force capable of supporting anything resembling modern American doctrine, given the time and resources they had.

Even in the absence of any other factors, Americans in particular have a more positive outlook culturally than slavic peoples tend to, so that’s part of it. 

I personally also hate to see people dwell on defeat because I think it harms your ability to fight, and so I think many other people also may have privately pessimistic outlooks but want to be encouraging.

A third thought; spreading defeatist rhetoric is a standard tool of any propaganda campaign, and still others may be worried that amplifying negative news or narratives may be unwittingly aiding russian objectives.

Any way you slice it though, the Ukrainians have done a hell of a job thus far fighting the Russians, and even if they do manage to seize territory from Ukraine, any attempt to call that a victory on their part will ring hollow.

Providing facts based on sources and evidence improvers outcomes in a military context, not bullshitting.

Especially when you can answer with a straight face where you got that from. ""How do you know that"""" asks the commander? ""We spotted them with ISR."" Awesome job!

""Tomorrow, at dawn, the 145th will likely advance SW to attack Barvinkove."" you said. ""How do you know that"" asks the commander? ""Because that's what I think they'd do. It makes sense."" you said with confidence. ""Get the fuck out of my TOC."" says the colonel. 

Because hunches are bullshit. Its just a guess, and even an educated guess is just a guess, nothing more. Those guesses are wrong as often as right, probably more wrong since so many of them are founded on bullshit, and in military context wrong guesses get our people killed, which are the wrong people to get killed.

I provided the additional info so others reading this realize exchange know that I have a personal stake in this discussion besides being well read on military history (better than you anyway). I've literally dealt first hand with the issues of bad guesses by intelligence officers. 

On top of that I have most of the entirety of the military historical record that can't stop talking about the dangers of military intelligence inserting their opinions as if its fact when its nothing more than a guess. So are all the others that agree with me are full of shit too? Or quite possibly are you actually in the minority? 

Was I and my bros saved by intelligence summaries and estimates that our secret squirrels got right? Maybe. But I also know for a fact how many times they killed my buddies by being wrong.

I was listing an example of a conflict in which Russia fought for years and suffered many casualties throughout them, that did not fundamentally change Russia's perspective on aggressive regional power plays.

&gt;Of course, WW1 also explains why humiliation is a risky strategy, since humiliating the Germans rather directly led to WW2.

The Germans were never decisively defeated in WW1, which allowed the Stab in the Back myth to take hold. That myth was contingent on the claim that Germany was on the cusp of victory in WW1. Taking Crimea would be a decisive defeat for Russia.

The case of Iran is an even better example - alternating white houses are going to keep vaccilating back and forth on the goal of sanctions, because there are two main factions with fundamentally different goals in mind.  One sees sanctions as a path to getting Iran to agree to a more stable and friendly posture, the other wants to use sanctions (and any other method) to eventually cause a collapse of the Iranian government.",2aaea1e125594c4da0cf76cfc959d55a1ca8dc90,True,False,,,,,0,1653526829,,0,{},ia0c3ab,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_ia0b3fg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/ia0c3ab/,1653526842,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653498029.0,

This is also a great point, because Russia is not at the point where they’re *just* asking for DPR/PR.

The reason why I would call this a danger sign for them, is because the continued existence of an effective Ukrainian army means those regions are always in danger of being grabbed back. 

Similarly, the UA are going to get better equipment while Russia stagnates under sanctions, which makes a future repeat of the conflict even less apetizing.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces prioritized advances east and west of Popasna in order to cut Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) southwest of Severodonetsk and complete encirclement efforts in Luhansk Oblast.  
Russian forces have likely entered Lyman and may use this foothold to coordinate with advances southeast of Izyum to launch an offensive on Siversk.  
Russian forces may start the Battle of Severodonetsk prior to completely cutting off Ukrainian GLOCs southwest and northwest of Severodonetsk.  
Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia City in an attempt to disrupt a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces operating in the east.

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive towards the Russian border. Russan forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to Northern Kharkiv in the near future.  
Russian forces are prioritizing cutting off two major highways to Severodonetsk but may start to storm the city before they successfully cut GLOCs.  
Occupation forces in Mariupol will continue to strengthen administrative control of the city but are likely unsure as to what the ultimate annexation policy will be.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in Southern Ukraine.",98790bdb90440d9d06ecb3aa8b5e7ef22fe65a3b,True,False,,,,,0,1653525407,,0,{},ia09253,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t3_uxfrv9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/ia09253/,1653525424,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653496607.0,

Yep, an E6 who nearly died numerous times because intelligence estimates made by your brethren were bullshit guesses they tricked our commanders into believing were legit. Didn't even get a ""my bad"" either, instead they rolled right into the next shitshow prediction.

Also an E6 with a history and pol sci degree, who actually reads history books to learn from them. 

&gt;The intelligence at the outset of Desert Storm correctly prepared the battlespace for a relatively easy victory over a massive enemy force. 

Have you studied either one of those wars? No, of course not. 

Days before the ground war started, of EVERY division commander and above in XVIII and VII Corps the only commander who thought it was going to be easy and not everyone taking 20% casualties minimum was Barry McCaffrey. And you think their G2s did a good job on that one? Try reading Atkinson's Crusade. 

&gt;As it did for Iraq 2003. 

Further reason you have no credibility. OIF invasion was a failure intelligence at every level. US military intelligence were expecting us to get hit with MWDs all the way to the Karbala Gap. Intelligence Identified entire phantom Iraqi divisions. They thought the IA would actually fight conventionally in large numbers.  Didn't at all consider Fedeyeen. Considered Baghdad was going to be a bloodbath like Stalingrad. Do you really think any intel weinie thought it would fall to a brigade level Thunder Run? They got nearly everything wrong. The only ones who got shit right were the White House neocons who said the Iraqis wouldn't fight but would welcome us, which most did until the insurgency those nitwits didn't consider started. Try reading Cobra II. 

This is a great example of how problematic this subject is and why I don't take it seriously. You know enough jargon and possess enough showmanship to convince the masses that your techniques for reading of tea leaves is valid. To sell that you tossed out some bullshit statements to try to build your case without realizing the former infantry junior NCO you're trying to put in his place read books you clearly didn't, despite you being an intelligence officer.

That's part of it, but not all of it.

I think war is intrisically hard to understand, because the participants are adversaries who try as hard as they can to come up with tactics/strategems/etc that their opponent won't understand, so as to get an edge over them.

It's like predicting stock market movements: as soon as you understand them ,that understanding comes part of the movement and therefore you don't can't predict them any more.

It's highly speculative what the consequences of that or anything else would be for Putin's regime. It's also speculative what sort of defeat would most deter Russia in the future. But humiliation isn't particularly deterring - it leaves someone itching for round 2.
