Germans shoot them immediatly. Peng! Peng! Peng! (german for pow pow pow)

The truth is something in between, Turkey is extremely important to the west and that's why the west can't leave it completely independent. One of it's importances; Turkey denied access to the infamous İncirlik airbase to NATO back when the invasion happened, but they couldn't do the same in the recent war as they were threatened with extreme sanctions this time around.  If you ever think the NATO truly cares about the Kurds then you're delusional and misinformed, they only use them as a card against Turkey but they have abandoned the Kurds many many times. NATO also doesn't want to lose that card, which is why they didn't include Turkey in their collation against IS, because they know Turkey cares more about the PKK threat than IS and they'll simply use this and bomb the fucking living shit out of the Kurds... which ironically they got to anyway, nothing the US or NATO can do about it in the end... not worth damaging their loyal satrap's relations and having him rebel from their control. They simply don't and never cared about the Kurds and lives that'll be lost. That is just one example to show you how independent and non-autonomy from the west Turkey can be at the same time.

As for erdo he's a democratically elected president who became more of a dictator later. r/ turkey is filled with edgy 14yos who don't know shit about shit. I've been there and I know what actual Turks (from various political leanings) think about the situation, at best this sub only represent one political wing.

&gt;And what does israel being a western ally have to do with it? Saudis a western ally Iraq maybe.? 

Big difference buddy, Israel IS the west's ally.... Saudi is just an oil ally, they'll abandon the retarded nobility there when they no longer have any oil. They won't do the same with Israel, you might think I'm crazy for saying this but the US does tailor the rest of the MENA so it can fit with Israel and grants them stability, that's why the always refused to negotiate and accept even favorable terms by Islamic groups or just opposition groups that may seem to may even in the slight be a danger to Israel in the future. That's why they've started easing with Iran too, because they know they're a lesser of near threat than any of these ideals.

&gt;And didn’t European Jews also flee to Palestine to escape nazi Germany?

True, but Israel made it's legitimacy from the ones that were already in Palestine or came from other MENA places. no one wants the Europeans, they don't belong here and they never did... they're basically colonizers.

And tbh the west kind of has to if your governments right now decided to implement voting changes idk what the west could do tbh like the west overall has had enough of invading random countries and I doubt they’d support the western leaders invading a country to stop a dictator let alone stop Iraq from adding voting changes so unless another Middle East country stopped you I’m a bit confused what’s stopping you unless the Middle Eastern goverment a rn do

And turkey I’m a bit confused on cause a lot in the west have called it a dictatorship but then some in r/turkey who are anti erdogan or one person said it was a democracy and I don’t see how the west is stopping you from developing could you elaborate ples?

And what does israel being a western ally have to do with it? Saudis a western ally Iraq maybe.?

Instruction for commanders (how to deter Armed Forces, Security Service and reconnaissance and sabotage groups of Ukraine)  
1. Act during daylight, they are more effective during nighttime. Don’t risk at night. During daytime they rest in administrative buildings. We can pass them.   
2. They install civil online web cameras (with night vision) and detect our position and movement.  
3. From the first look, enemy APC is very old. But equipped with modern sights and navigation inside.  
4. Civil vans with mortars. Shell very quick and escape.  
5. Use fake heat models for ambush deception. You can’t detect whether its real or fake ambush. And where is the real ambush.   
6. Snipers shoot from the 1-mile range and very effectively (using foreign weapon). While shooting, they use infrared backlight and can be detected.  
7. In rear positions there are a lot of sabotage reconnaissance groups and local populace informers. No civilians in the AOR! Every person in your unit AOR is potential intel agent or fire spotter regardless age, sex or appearance.  
8. You must train in using your mortar assets effectively. Target detected – immediate fire!  
9. Their snipers, artillery, and sabotage groups (trained by foreign instructors) are very effective in destroying our C2 units. Consider their 8-years combat experience. Underestimation of the enemy bring losses.   
10. About navigation errors. There is no such thing as inaccuracy. Of Corse you may find inaccuracy if you know the terrain. For example, North on navigation and compass could be shown on different directions. Or your current point can move even when you hold position. It is mandatory to use compass.   
11. During operating of Elerone (Russian UAV) stream could be unacceptable. Maybe because of EW. They intercept signal of our UAV and steal them.  
12. Do not gather armor vehicle in one location, even for refueling.

The US DID conquer, installing puppet govs there is just how modern empires conquer other nations. They're losing Iraq to Iran, because of many mistakes they made but I don't have to get into that.... they still haven't lost it yet.

&gt;How is turkey semi independent? They are completely independent idk what you mean how are they not independent?

They dare not disobey their NATO overlords in major matters.... A coup was literally orchestrated by a group the US holds in its soil and when it failed, NATO is doing it's hardest to defame that too disobedient of satrap there. That is just an oversimplification of what it's like.

&gt;You just need to vote them out don’t you?

Hahahaha, that is one good joke.... You think there's ever a fair democracy in the MENA??? maybe in some minor ones there're but in the majority there isn't. And just fyi most of the MENA doesn't really wants democracy in the same sense the west have, Islamic nations had a form of voting before the west ever sets foot in our soil. But they won't respect our choices in how we want to govern ourselves.

&gt;From my understanding turkey may have democracy I thought Iraq did Bahrain doesnt Saudi 

Correct, Turkey does have democracy mainly... except when a certain dictatorish guy is in power now but that's a whole lotta of something else... and like I said not everything that's wrong with the MENA is the fault of the west, but a whole lotta of it is. Or atleast the west is stopping the MENA from developing.

&gt;not sure about Lebanon israel does palastine does soo if there is democracy then there doesn’t need to be a revolution

Lebanon is just another mess, lets not get into it. But it's not entirely the US's fault in this one, Hezbollat is the problem mainly. Israel is western nation in all but name, it's a western ally, not what I meant in my comment. Palestine is also a mess but it's cuz of Israel ofc. And before we get into the Palestine-Israel fuckfest (which I don't want to), I just want to let you know that Israel would've never existed were it not for the Westren backed arab leaders which started persecuting Jews out of nowhere which have lived alongside Muslims and Christians for a long time there.

&gt; genocide
A genocide means to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.
According to population charts, [Israel is really bad at genocide](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/state-of-palestine-population/). Actually, Israel is so bad at genocide, that it’s [population growth rate](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/israel-population/) is even smaller than that of Palestine and is going down. (Maybe I should start saying it’s the Israeli population that is undergoing genocide).

So please whatever your opinion is, before using words such as “genocide”, “apartheid” and more, please do the research. I’m sure there are much more fitting words that can convey your opinion without comparing Israel to the Nazis.

&gt;nuclear weapons are a bluff unless Russia ends up in a direct conflict with the West that they cannot win

Though I see your reasoning, Russians are already battling 11 miles away from Poland, this can get nasty anytime. And I honestly don't see any scenario in which Russia can win a war against the West, should China remain more or less neutral. That's why I worry about nuclear weapons being used, as sort of an option of last resort 

Also, I don't see aging population (long-term problem) as a critical factor in a war (short-term thinking)

&gt;He already knows he's in a precarious situation in his own country. Hence why he's in hiding.

I thought he was hiding to protect himself from strange accidents that could happen to him (like in Haiti last year)? But yeah, if he is hiding from his own people, that's good news

&gt;The number of POWs that have turned themselves over is incredibly high

I didn't know that, also good news. Do you have sources? Today finding reliable information in internet is quite tricky for regular people like me

&gt;We can only hope India lands on our side or remains neutral

This is totally out of my field of knowledge. Does India have a powerful military / would they pose a big threat? Who would be their ""natural"" alliance: communist block or free world?

&gt;It is also far more likely for Westerners to survive a nuclear scenario than the East

They could have presented an ultimatium or found a 3rd party like China or Isreal to try and work thru the issues. Ukraine may have just said ""forget the Donbas and Crimea. We just want to be left alone."" If faced with the option of ""If you dont promise to stay out of NATO you are being invaded to demilitarize you and prevent you from joining NATO"" Ukraine may have talked.   
The choice was made by Putin and by the Russian government to launch an attack without any warning on a sovereign nation with the right to self determination.   


Even if the US sent the CIA in to help fuel the flames of a pro-western revolution then russia is welcome to do the same. 

They reason they don't, can't, won't is because they literally have no support in the parts of the country that are not ethnic Russian and the only way to impose their will is thru direct force.

On the day of the massacre, Abeer's father Qassim was enjoying time with his family, while his sons were at school.\[16\] In broad daylight, the four U.S. soldiers walked to the house, not wearing their uniforms, but wearing army-issue long underwear to look like ""ninjas"",\[10\] and separated 14 year-old Abeer and her family into two different rooms. Spielman was responsible for grabbing Abeer's 6-year-old sister, who was outside the house with her father, and bringing her inside the house.\[17\] Green then broke Abeer's mother's arms (likely evidence of a struggle that resulted when she heard her daughter being raped in the other room) and murdered her parents and younger sister, while two other soldiers, Cortez and Barker, raped Abeer.\[18\] Barker wrote that Cortez pushed Abeer to the floor, lifted her dress, and tore off her underwear while she struggled. According to Cortez, Abeer “kept squirming and trying to keep her legs closed and saying stuff in Arabic,” as he and Barker took turns holding her down and raping her.\[19\] Cortez testified that Abeer heard the gunshots in the room in which her parents and little sister were being held, causing her to scream and cry even more as she was being violently raped by the men. Green then emerged from the room saying, ""I just killed them, all are dead"".\[20\] Green, who later said the crime was ""awesome"",\[21\] then raped Abeer and shot her in the head several times. After the massacre, Barker poured petrol on Abeer and the soldiers set fire to the lower part of the girl's body, from her stomach down to her feet. Barker testified that the soldiers gave Spielman their bloodied clothes to burn and that he threw the AK-47 used to murder the family into a canal. They left to ""celebrate"" their crimes with a meal of chicken wings.\[22\] Meanwhile, the fire from Abeer's body eventually spread to the rest of the room, and the smoke alerted neighbors, who were among the first to discover the scene.\[2\] One recalled, ""The poor girl, she was so beautiful. She lay there, one leg was stretched and the other bent and her dress was lifted up to her neck.""\[11\] They ran to tell Abu Firas Janabi, Abeer's uncle, that the farmhouse was on fire and that dead bodies could be seen inside the burning building. Janabi and his wife rushed to the farmhouse and doused some of the flames to get inside. Upon witnessing the scene inside, Janabi went to a checkpoint guarded by Iraqi Army soldiers to report the crime. Abeer's 9- and 11-year-old younger brothers, Ahmed and Mohammed, returned from school that afternoon to find smoke billowing from the windows. After going to their uncle's home, they returned to the house only to be traumatized, finding their father shot in the head, mother shot in the chest, 6-year-old sister Hadeel shot in the face, and 14-year-old sister Abeer's remains burning.\[6\]",a9e7c13d28396d7e838834ed09fe7bc6ad6cfff8,True,False,,,,,0,1647230065,,0,{},i0ksr01,False,t3_td9vnr,False,True,t1_i0k4ney,/r/war/comments/td9vnr/on_this_day_little_abeer_qasim_was_savagely_raped/i0ksr01/,1647230079,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647201265.0

The same comment you made few hours ago, exactly it. Whenever Westerners see Arabs they start calling them hateful stuff among them is this and the ofc famous ""goatfucker"" when ironically it's their soldiers who commit these crimes and it's their countries that allow beastility.

&gt;Since you're so aware of generalizations, shouldn't you understand that these are just fucked up people?

Alot of the US soldiers are fucked up, they choose fucked up people and that's why they commit these crimes.

&gt;The fact that they're westerners has nothing to do with it. Why did you feel the need to say that? That's something you need to think about.

If you look at my og comment I said ""Westerners who call us..."" so I specified a certain type of Westerners, I didn't generalize.... it's not my fault you didn't read.

&gt;Also, it's pretty pathetic to ignore his question. He made a fair point and you avoided it by insulting him. Not a good look.  


That is not a question by this point, it's an insult idiots use. I can't count the many times I've refuted that stupid claims he made and I don't want to keep refuting them everytime I say something.

The reactions of how how things play along after his fall is similar to every place where dictatorships fall, a time of confusion, disorder in things and a somewhat degree of chaos might occur because is change taking place.

Usually the state that looses the dictatorship will eventually reach a balanced point and re-emerge hopefully as a more free state. But it needs caution and nurturing of values such as freedoms, democracy, liberties, justice, respecting of human rights as well as other values.

The population must support a reform and participate in the shifts of power and adopt a ""rebuild out of nothing"" stance as well as keeping and eye out for extremists or other dictators or totalitarian groups not to re-emerge.

&gt;We were not even at war when the September 11th attacks took place

Fucking BULLSHIT, ffs stop it. Gulf war had a borderline genocide committed by the US against Iraq (atleast it was labeled as such by UN Coordinator at the time who quit afterwards). Not to mentions the few minor other wars.

&gt;it was a completely unprovoked attack on civilians. Are you just going to ignore that happened?

Are you waiting for me to justify 9/11 or something? it happened for a reason, it's not like they suddenly decided to go bomb the US for nothing. And the reason was valid but the act not so much....

I don't think bombing innocent people is nice, if that's your question.

Now that we got that out of the way, US have killed atleast 15000% more than the number of people that died at 9/11 and they still want more.",3bb2e6724a1be7973b1d811ac5343005d55c085e,True,False,,,,,0,1647216024,,0,{},i0k0jhp,True,t3_td9vnr,False,True,t1_i0jz3v0,/r/war/comments/td9vnr/on_this_day_little_abeer_qasim_was_savagely_raped/i0k0jhp/,1647216042,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647187224.0

Yeah I wasn't referring to those, they're still bad but they're considered eastern yeah. It was just a bit of an extra detail.

&gt;there is pretty universal opposition to it along with what I think is pretty clear opposition to the current Russian government.

Not really, the person I met over from there was before 2011 and he told me about the atrocious before the US even say anything. The US ignored all the calls for this genocide, they only used it when their relations with China deteriorated. Don't ever think that any of the Uyghurs look for the US to rescue, they know that they're only doing that for their interests not because they're humanitarians or care about their lives. US backed govs in the MENA started deporting these Uyghurs at one point, there was once that I had these Uyghurs that I knew taken from their neighborhood deported back and since then I've never heard from them, I have no idea what happened to any of them. The neighborhood I lived in had alot of foreign students, refugees and expats. So I got to see the police going in taking some of them. [It made the news I think back then.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/egypt-muslims-uighurs-deportations-xinjiang-china.html) and to this day they're still hunting the rest down to deport them. This wasn't us the Egyptians, this was the government the US itself brought to power.

There's alot more that don't and simply ""got away"".

&gt;The American people stood up

That's not entirely true since they unanimously supported that invasion but I see your point. And that is the one of the problem, the propaganda machine is always there before you. Americans always think they're special and their country doesn't do the same things others do but that is not true at all. US propaganda machine is pretty good, it's so good that it has alot of influence overseas. China will never surpass that media weapon the US have.

&gt;The American people wouldn't do this if they hated you or your way of life.

Sure I think alot are taught to hate it through lies, I don't think most actually hate it on their own because they don't know about our culture

&gt;They couldn't even establish a modern police force due to the amount of Middle Eastern soldiers who refused to give up their ""Tea Boys""

Are you referring to Bacha bazi??? because oh boy I have alot to say about that and how the US instead of fighting that practice like the Taliban did, allowed and enabled it instead.

&gt;would defect upon meeting of resistance, and whose combat training yielded similar results as a chimp with an AK.

I wonder why,, it's almost as if no one wants to fight their own country men for some fat business man elsewhere. Almost all of the US allies are like that, they're nothing without them... ANA fell the moment the US left because they had no reason to exist anymore, they were a levy force of a satrap not a country of their own. US isn't that smart at as they seem, they never learn from their mistakes.

&gt;Stop looking to the past and blaming the West for your problems.

Seriously? that is the most douchey thing you can ever say. THE WEST IS THE PROBLEM, to this day they won't let us govern ourselves, they still fund dictators and create puppet regimes, when we fight them we're labelled terrorist and turned into outcasts. Even as the US is now coming to an end they're handing their mantle to a new oppressors, Russia, Iran, Israel or Turkey.... some of which they're enemies of but they prefer them to rule us than us ruling ourselves. I know this because the US fights the culture itself, no matter how amount of deals people try to make with the US they mostly refuse the conditions even when they're at their most reasonable state because they don't fight just because of the oil, that is what I found out way later.

&gt;Police your own people better so other countries don't try to do it for you.

Sure, if you just let me and recalled all your men and also stopped sucking from that oil bosom, I'll get on to it.

&gt; Establish a group of people who have morality, honor, dignity, and bravery to enforce the values you hold so dear.

Sure we have all that, just not the same way you define it. The people who have honor are fought by the US.

&gt;Until you address your own internal issues- the West shouldn't even be on your mind.

\*sigh\* the west has it's dicks up our noses, so much that we can even focus on anything else. but ofc it's easy to say that from your place, no offense.",6affdfb19c09fa3251328736a0939ae97644a0da,True,False,,,,,0,1647213784,,0,{},i0jvon3,True,t3_td9vnr,False,True,t1_i0jre4p,/r/war/comments/td9vnr/on_this_day_little_abeer_qasim_was_savagely_raped/i0jvon3/,1647213799,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647184984.0

But as I grew up I met alot of fellow Muslims starting from school all the way to collage, Uyghurs, Russian Muslims, Chechens; Iraqis, Syrians, even Afghans and Pakistanis when I started going abroad, and then I've met and seen people who have actually been to western countries and I heard all their experiences and what everyone of them had to endure either from Russian genocides, Chinese ""cultural"" conversion or American bombing back when they invaded. Where I'm from started having the effects of American interference, Coups started happening. Governments that are directly funded by the West and the only reason they even exist is them shooing down unarmed protesters, break in houses and take people for no reason, young men who protested all that getting to have to spent their entire lives in political prisons.... You get the point. I started going online and now seeing us being blamed for all this eventhough we fought as hard as we can (maybe not hard enough) just made me hate the west even more tbh.

There's still members of PMC's/USM doing life for atrocities committed in the Middle East.

The American people stood up, was incarcerated, gave up their ways of life in support of holding back the war machine. At one point, even going so far as to sabotage military operations in the past. The American people wouldn't do this if they hated you or your way of life.  


That being said, it's undeniable that the U.S had witnessed atrocities committed by the people of the Middle east, against the people of the Middle East on a way larger scale. They couldn't even establish a modern police force due to the amount of Middle Eastern soldiers who refused to give up their ""Tea Boys"", would sell equipment for dope, would defect upon meeting of resistance, and whose combat training yielded similar results as a chimp with an AK.   


Stop looking to the past and blaming the West for your problems. Police your own people better so other countries don't try to do it for you.

And Irak is an exemple lost in many others, we could talk about the millions death caused by the US foreign policy allover the middle-east for days...

The only difference with the USA is that the ""Face of Power"" changes every mandate, but behind, same shit.

Bush dynasty, allready mentioned, Obama, no US presidency delivered as many drone bombs as he did, and he recived the Nobel of Peace for it. Trump, best exemple as democrat for sure. Do we have to continue ?

I personally think we should stay on our side of the water, we have to many problems in our own country to worry about and the money would be better used on that. But I realize that if we don’t get involved in some cases, it’s bad news. 

Examples… 
1) WW2… Europe was basically under Nazi control before the US got involved. Russia was holding them off in the west, but wasn’t making any progress until the US got involved and forced them to defend themselves on 2 fronts.
2) Korea- though limited in success, the North had at one point taken over nearly the entire peninsula and if the US didn’t get involved all your Kpop bands and Korean based anime (who do you thinks animates it) wouldn’t exist as all of South Korea would be under the north’s dictatorship. 
3) Afghanistan- we went in fought hard and helped them maintain a peaceful government were women had rights, and people weren’t slaves. We pull out and within days the Government is run by the taliban. Women and children are sexually assaulted and dehumanized, children are being sold into marriages with old men to be slaves.

Libya was a shithole under Gaddafi, all of his ""programs"" were a joke, Libya's healthcare was mediocre and the education was terrible. 

He put the country in pointless wars, lost all of them, funded terrorist groups, funded the worst regimes in Africa, kept Libya repressed and unable to develop 

This guy had gas stations all over Africa, with his face plastered all over them, and yet somehow his country did not develop like the Gulf countries? Very strange 

Libya had the world's 8th largest oil reserved and like 4 million (?) people. I won't even expect ghaddafi to make it like Norway or some Scandinavian country, but the bare minimum he could have done was make his country another Qatar, Kuwait or UAE. His citizens could have lived extremely prosperous lives and would have been doing wheelies on gold plated jeeps.

Fuck that guy.

West Ukraine would be more or less inhabitable until cleanup can be done, like with Chernobyl, but with less fallout spreading through Europe. Putler will get Kyiv, and Ukraine seises to exist.

This is a truly sadistic and horrendous event and is widely used within our organizations to try and root out the environments where things like this happen. There are bad people everywhere. 

I am not here to debate who is good and who is bad or if the war in Iraq was right or wrong. War is horrible and unimaginable things happen in war. I have carried my fare share of dead children from suicide bombers. This targeted rape and murder should never happen and yet it happens around the world all the time. Little kids are abducted, raped and killed in the United States. I do appreciate your post though as I do remember this incident every single year and speak about it with those around me so we can all learn from the evil that exists out there regardless of where you are from.

I think the vast majority of veterans would actually agree that they met some of the best people they know in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Hard working civilians trying to make it through life with very little in a war zone and they will offer you their last piece of bread in a heartbeat. At the end of the day it is a very sad thing that innocent lives are lost in these conflicts. I would say the United States and other NATO countries try to limit collateral damage quite a bit more than the Russians launching entire volleys of unguided MLRS munitions into towns and cities, but it doesn't take away from the fact that innocent people have died at the hands of both. 

Not to take away from your post I would like to pay my respects to those tragically murdered in this incident.
