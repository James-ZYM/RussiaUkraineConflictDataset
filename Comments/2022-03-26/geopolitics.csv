For rapproachment, India will likely ask for good faith negotiation on where borders are in Ladakh Pradash.  Ever since Sino-Indian war, China's behavior indicates they are not interested in well defined border. 

For acknowledging China's claim on South China Sea, India is likely to ask China to pull back their presence in Indian Ocean, aka 'String of Pearls' (especially in Maldives and Sri Lanka).  I think we all know how China feels about their sphere of influence.

On paper, China and India could be allies.  Both are nervous about US hegemony.  Both feel they have been wronged by the West in the past.  China has capital and technology, but a poor demographics, where as India needs investment and has much younger demographics.  China could possibly become very wealthy by integrating India into China's supply chain.

But mutually beneficial win-win deals do not seem to be in China's DNA.  As saying goes, 'for China, win-win means China winning twice.'  

They could have easily pulled Phillipines away from US influence, but in stead they sent merchant ships to harass Filipino fishermen.  Australia was on its way to become China's strategic ally - they were about to give a lease on a port in Darwin.  But they could not stand Australians exercising free speech (have some respect for other's ways), so now they are strategic adversaries.  The list goes on.

At the moment, China seems to be utterly unable to exercise modesty and show consideration for others, even though they are not quite powerful enough to afford this attitude.  If I were China, I would consider this to be a weakness I need to improve upon as a part of self development.  I don't think China sees it this way.",6e5aad51d32d9d03b072d3d308ce1e8fe0e12e0a,True,False,,,,,0,1648338029,,0,{},i293wcz,False,t3_tlzy3j,False,True,t1_i1wi3v2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tlzy3j/china_has_a_huge_strategic_opening_with_india/i293wcz/,1648338043,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648309229.0,

To be honest this sounds more like an answer to a question on an AP homework assignment akin to ""What is geopolitics and talk about a specific geopolitical concern of yours?""

Name dropping geopolitical terms is cool but you must assume people don't understand or don't have a deep understanding and attempt to either explain it or say it in layman terms. 
* Random anecdotes are not needed unless directly tying into your essay.
* Four paragraphs on the domestic policy/response of countries in an essay about geopolitics. A lot of talk about climate change (which is a geopolitical issue, but very vague in this.) Please do more to focus your writing. 
* Both an essay and article should finalize by answering any questions if not outright reiterating your initial point. Your opening should directly introduce a question you hope to answer or the main point of your article (which is hard to pinpoint: The artic is a hotspot for other countries in the future?)

&gt; At least at first the Russians were almost certainly trying to minimize civilian casualties, focusing instead on military targets, including military infrastructure, and still haven't made any notable efforts to destroy the infrastructure of many of the cities they currently have surrounded, despite obviously having the capability to carry out precision strikes from across the country as shown by the missile that destroyed the foreign legion's training base near the border with Poland.

Russia has shelled civilians &amp; humanitarian corridors. The idea that Russia is restraining itself for humanitarian reasons is bunk.

[],False,,Harmonic_Strategy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cpdderd,False,False,"This question feels like an ontological trap. Who says Argentina isn't a Western nation, whatever that means? But I'll try to engage meaningfully. There are kind of two meanings of 'Western' that might be confused here.

The first meaning is basically the richer nations in Europe and their former colonies in USA, Canada and Australia. This is a fairly arbitrary grouping with roots in the post WW2 security arrangements. The second meaning is 'Westernized nation states', meaning states that have mostly adopted the economic and governing institutions of that first group: democracy, capitalism, rule of law, compliance and integration with various international orgs. 

Argentina is sort of by definition not part of that first group. Again, arbitrary grouping to some extent and not one that is particularly meaningful IMHO, except as a synonym for NATO. Argentina being part of the G20 (45 mil pop approaching middle income) is way more meaningful than some random label. Argentina is definitely a 'Westernized' nation along with most of Latin America.

As for why it's not closer, I don't think this is a surprise. Argentina is on a different continent and involved primarily in bulk commodity exports. It wants to keep open trade relations with as many people as possible. It has borders with Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia to deal with, but also friendly enough relations that military defense isn't such a pressing need. The Falklands war is kinda old news now but probably didn't help.

You seem to be very upset over gray areas and technicalities.  Many Eastern European countries like Poland and Hungary were certainly in a gray area as they began backsliding.  That is now being overlooked now because Russia has hardened lines that were previously very blurred.  Yes, they are also given more leeway because of their membership in various Western institutions like the EU and NATO.  But even if they are given these graces, they certainly are considered fringe rather than core West.  Serbia isn't considered Western despite their European credentials.

Perceptions aren't 100% fair and impartial.  But a country such as Japan can easily defeat any European bias through development and strong institutions.  Which are just good things to strive for regardless of any exclusive club membership.

&gt;Did the US cease to be Western because a populist was elected as president?

Did you just miss like the rest of the Western world absolutely freaking out about it?  Why do you think the very first thing Biden did upon his election was broadcast ""America is back!"" to his allies?  Yes, if the US continued down the Trumpian path it would no longer be considered Western.

Japan is Western, but not European. “Western” means rule of law, democracy, private property, open markets, respect for the individual, diversity, pluralism of opinion, and all the other freedoms that we enjoy, which we sometimes take for granted. We sometimes forget where they came from. But that’s what the West is.

This is puzzling to me, why did they try to push towards the south-west of the country if this was the case? they could've taken over the donbas region if they concentrated their forces there but didn't, they also could've avoided angering almost the whole population of Russian speakers in the country if they did that. 

I think it's more likely they had maximal, intermediate and minimal goals with the maximal one being to take over the swath of majority-plurality Russian-speaking territory in the East-south east of the country including the entire coastline linking to Transnistria in Moldova, or ceasing the capital quickly and negotiating a maximal version of the Minsk accords. But they failed to achieve these with their small force so are retreating to a more minimal goal that can be secured long-term, also knowing they have totally burned any allies they might have had in the country.",deefd4f890606d1be478fa972ba3c4894e87145d,True,False,,,,,0,1648322450,,0,{},i285y0i,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i25fij4,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i285y0i/,1648322463,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648293650.0,

In lots of eastern European countries fraught 19th century style nationalist projects, in multi ethnic states left after imperial break up, were condensed into the decades after WW1. Often they hitched their interests to that of the bloated chimera of German nationalism rampaging through eastern Europe in the 40s. This is basically what happened to parts of interwar Ukrainian nationalism, but also some of the Baltic States, Finland, Croatia, Hungary and a few others, Poland had a collaborationist government and police force. Even in Ireland Sean Russell and others were ok with collaboration. 

Because a lot of post soviet nationalisms define themselves against the soviet union (for obvious reasons) they can't use the struggle against extermination by nazis as a nationalist narrative. Also there aren't really that many people about who experienced the horrors of this first hand, so it doesn't take all that much crude ideological work to erase the horrific parts, including that the German nazi state regarded these nationalisms in similar fashion to the Slavic population as a whole and intended to exterminate most of them. So lots of post soviet nationalism sort of gets coloured by the post WW1 nationalism in some ways especially through expat communities.  

Also, in lot of post soviet countries these types of far right racist ideologies are useful to national polities because they don't really require any commitment to anything material, they encourage young men to fight and die just for ideas, so they're very common. If you look at the break-up of Yugoslavia all sides basically had racist/fascist militias operating in a quasi-state fashion, doing ethnic cleansing and other stuff that the governments wanted to distance themselves from. Some of that like the Croatian ones, had overt nazi symbolism attached, others like the Serbian or Bosian muslim had non nazi symbolism. 

In conclusion, it's kind of like asking why there were the BNP in the UK which historically hated nazis and also neo-nazis are not very sophisticated or discerning readers of history or anything.",ec7b91dddffa8a0d6c40479f3e8d17e8ca8d6e11,True,False,,,,,0,1648321920,,0,{},i284rt3,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i1xg3mn,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i284rt3/,1648321937,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648293120.0,

[],False,,Alphakarp,,,[],,,,text,t2_139rpm,False,False,"You're operating under the unquestioned assumption that the United States of America is fundamentally benign- simply willing to undertake ""tough decisions"" sometimes for the greater good. If something like the Iraq War happens, it is simply an embarassing little mistake; they meant well really, and it is all terribly *complex*. I don't see any evidence for this assumption. Like every nation which has ever existed since the dawn of human civilisation, the US is deeply cynical. It does whatever is in its strategic interest, and nothing more. If that happens to benefit the world, that is just a coincidence. As such I'm not moved at all by rhetoric that it's somehow childish or unuanced to condemn America's actions, because they're just making ""hard choices"" in their quest to rescue the ""future of civilization"". Every empire in history has made similar claims.  There is no rational reason to give them the benefit of the doubt when their actions lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, or even millions. Nobody forced America to invade Iraq or Vietnam. They knew the consequences. I treat American atrocities like I would atrocities from any other nation.

&gt;When you are fighting for the future of civilization, sometimes you have to do some unsavory things

This justification sounds very nice, until you actually examine it. There are plenty of Cold War-era crimes which I really struggle to rationalise as necessary, or simply brought on by reasonable fear of the Soviets. I certainly don't find it sufficient to explain away crimes against humanity, or genocide. Frankly, the threat of Communism doesn't even come close to handwaving the rape, murder, and enslavement of hundreds of thousands of people, including children. Take the invasion of East Timor, which killed 100K-200K people. East Timor was of very little strategic value at the time, and patently posed zero risk to any of its neighbours. The invasion was an act of naked aggression by Indonesia, far more deplorable than anything Russia is currently doing to Ukraine, and America assisted them every step of the way. The senior CIA officer in Indonesia(!) went on to comment that: ""*The only justification I ever heard (...) was the concern that East Timor was on the verge of being accepted as a new member of the United Nations and there was a chance that the country was going to be either leftist or neutralist and not likely to vote \[with the United States\] at the UN.*""

When you bankroll herding children into school buildings and setting them on fire because of the **possibility** that their country might one day oppose you, you aren't making tough decisions to rescue humanity, or acting in a panic to stop the Commies. You are tyrants who can tolerate nothing but total obedience from your vassal nations, committing a premeditated crime. You might similarly infer from my tone that I don't believe America allowing Saudi Arabia to intentionally bomb Yemeni food supplies while over 85,000 children starve to death is necessary, either. These are calculated, thoroughly sociopathic decisions America makes trying to expand its geopolitical dominance. No different from the actions of any other empire looking to expand its reach throughout history.

As such, you might understand why I feel no inherent inclination to support the activities of the United States of America, unless there is compelling *individual* reason to do so, such as in Ukraine. America is an megalomaniacal empire like any other, and Europe's relationship to it should be a purely pragmatic buisinesslike one. We should only assist them if it actually benefits humanity. Iraq and Afghanistan didn't.

&gt;Europeans to have a mature and responsible attitude about what needs doing, including the risks this entails.

These ""risks"", of course, are borne entirely by *other* people. Oops, we killed 650,000 Iraqis and created a laundry list of terror groups! How clumsy. But it was a necessary risk, you understand? 

I'm perfectly fine for European nations to assess for themselves whether America's adventures are ""responsible"". If they are actively preventing an ongoing genocide which threatens to kill millions, or securing basic safety in the oceans, then perhaps we should support them. If they are eliminating middling tyrants (and usually killing far more people in the process), or blockading Yemen into famine to expand the influence of the House of Saud, then no, I don't see much value in intervening. We could have ended world hunger thrice over with the ridiculous amount of money America has spent trying to nation-build in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. After a certain point, you have to admit to yourself that this probably isn't being done to save lives.",370309dde7b82646bbab8c85c31e533173bdf7c4,True,False,,,,,0,1648314824,,0,{},i27oc6k,False,t3_th0p2b,False,True,t1_i27eh2e,/r/geopolitics/comments/th0p2b/understanding_germanys_foreign_policy/i27oc6k/,1648314848,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648286024.0,

&gt; .

That's helpful. That says that the ROC says that Tibet was under the sovereignty of China in 1792. That's different from a claim to Tibet. Especially since at the time of Simla, Tibet had declared they are an independent country and the ROC had no control of (most of) Tibet. 

So much closer (they claimed China once had sovereignty over Tibet, in the same way as they once had sovereignty over Vietnam), but still not quite a claim (or are you saying China also claims Vietnam?). So (according to Sperling) as early as 1913 a government of China claimed that Tibet was (at least at some time) sovereign over China. 

Sperling goes on to clarrify what this means, (read just after your quote). It means that the ROC claimed that Tibet was a vassal of Qing not a part of China.  

The other question is what exactly did they claim China was sovereign over? ""Tibet"" is too vague. 

Anyway your argument (I think) is that if any previous government claims territory, it is ok for a present government to invade.

That's helpful. That says that the ROC says that Tibet was under the sovereignty of China in 1792. That's different from a claim to Tibet. Especially since at the time of Simla, Tibet had declared they are an independent country and the ROC had no control of (most of) Tibet. 

So much closer (they claimed China once had sovereignty over Tibet, in the same way as they once had sovereignty over Vietnam), but still not quite a claim. So (according to Sperling) as early as 1913 a government of China claimed that Tibet was (at least at some time) part of China.

I don't.  You can be a friend of the crips (or even share similarities with a crip) without being a crip.  The cultural differences are enough.  They are not the ""west"".

But you're right about how nebulous things become.  I don't disagree with that for a second.  I would say that cultural aspects like common language and heritage are factors.  The majority of NATO uses ABCEDF.  As crazy as it sounds, this makes things much easier (and by human nature, brings us slightly closer as a people than perhaps Russia, or China).  

Are there exceptions like Poland or the Czech Republic?  Of course.  But when you look at NATO members that don't share the same alphabet, there's definitely a shared, FSU-scented theme, no?

&gt;during the cold war, especially in europe, the west was basically nato and the east was the warsaw pact and eastern europe.

Those were the predominant tribes, for sure.  As a North American, we would have called China and Japan the ""East"" back then (as we do now).  To your point, it wasn't so much inclusion **into** a tribe as it was exclusionary (""Everyone over there who ain't us, is them..."")

Western hemisphere is a piece of the puzzle (and maybe the impetus for the term?).  But then you have western Europe (which has been bleeding east since the wall fell).  The term is indeed a construct as much as race is.

Possibly a ""hail mary"" pass; worth a try to end the conflict early, but not the main strategy. 

&gt; all the forces near Kyiv that are now retreating to Donbas:

The twitter you linked to doesn't mention those forces retreating, only entrenching, taking up ""defensive positions"". Whether or not that even means anything stil lremains to be seen.

&gt;This is just the facts on the ground catching up and Putin trying to get something out of this to be able to claim a win.

Perhaps it is, but neither you nor I know for certain. There is a possibility that you're correct, and if so we will learn when the war is over, but what evidence there is right now does not support you making that claim with such certainty.

With the benefit of hindsight, and looking back at the conflict with Russia's consistently stated goals in mind, I believe the whole thing has played out with an almost perfect adherence to those stated goals, starting with the amount of troops they built up on the border prior to the invasion, [which many commentators agreed was simply not enough to occupy Ukraine](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/03/russia-couldnt-occupy-ukraine-if-it-wanted-to/).

Russia only deployed a fifth or so of their active military personnel to Ukraine. If they seriously wanted to occcupy the country as a whole, there are around 800000 more reservists they could have called on, but they haven't. They are going into Ukraine with a military force that is numerically equal to that of the Ukrainian standing army. Once you take into account Ukraine's reservists, most of not all of which have likely been conscripted by now, and the mass conscription efforts calling on all men ages 18-60 to join, the numbers are almost certainly 2:1 in Ukraine's favor if not better. The size of the Russian forces participating in Ukraine simply does not support the idea that they're trying to conquer the country; what it does support is a considerably more modest set of goals. You cannot say that this is the Russians ""backtracking"" or whatever because these are the forces they deployed from the very start, before whatever setbacks they may have encountered during the invasion, and as such it's the clearest piece of evidence on the Russians' initial intents that we have.

In addition, they have largely refrained from urban warfare, the most notable exception to this being in Mariupol, likely as part of their ""denazification"" as that is where forces of the Azov batallion were stationed, but also quite possibly for the sake of building a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbass (if there is any part of Ukraine aside from those two areas areas which Russia is likely to annex, it's the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, which from my understanding have sizable ethnic Russian populations with pro-Russia sentiments, and the current behavior of the Russian-imposed government in Kherson seems to support this intent, what with the introduction of Rubles as a currency to Kherson).

At least at first the Russians were almost certainly trying to minimize civilian casualties, focusing instead on military targets, including military infrastructure, and still haven't made any notable efforts to destroy the infrastructure of many of the cities they currently have surrounded, despite obviously having the capability to carry out precision strikes from across the country as shown by the missile that destroyed the foreign legion's training base near the border with Poland. This again supports the idea that the goal is the demilitarization, not conquest, of Ukraine.",93c39b1b03cd802833f938de64e3078103484a63,True,False,,,,,0,1648307586,,0,{},i277rce,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i26s41h,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i277rce/,1648307598,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648278786.0,

I will use an example I have direct experience with. 

The Malaysian government is currently discussing how to prevent famine from rising wheat prices.

See the poor in Malaysia use chicken's feet as their primary source of protein and those chicken grow eatting wheat.

This war is driving up wheat prices. Which will drive up chicken's feet prices.

Malaysian, unsurprisingly isn't sanctioning Russia. It can't afford to do ANYTHING that would lower the quality of life of its poor further.

Quoting Sofia Lyon from the University of California:

&gt; Thousands of years ago, “the West” was born in Greece with all of its advancements in culture and science. Greek plays and myths, the architecture of the great temples, and even the basic schools of thought all survived long past the fall of the ancient Greek city-states. They moved westward with the next great civilization, the Romans, and, after Rome fell, continued to move even further west until they reached America.

So ""western"", in the most long-lasting sense of the word, is a Eurocentric term that refers to the roughly 3000-year-old cultural tradition that dates back to the ancient Greeks. ""Eastern"", in this conceptualisation of the world, refers to the cultures of Arabia, Persia, India and China (although the issue is a little nebulous with India nowadays, as it has become ever more westernised from the time of the British Raj up to the present day. 

Western culture spread from Greece to the Roman Empire, eventually throughout most of Europe and finally to other continents thanks to colonialism. From the time of the Spanish conquest onwards, all major Spanish American cities lived through all the cultural, artistic and academic trends of the west: the Baroque, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Modernism, Postmodernism. These are countries that speak a western language (Spanish), whose poets write Petrarchan (Italian) sonnets, whose city centres are full of western architecture, whose universities study Greco-Roman philosophy, who use western models of government and western judicial code, whose overarching religion is Catholicism. There is cultural syncretism because, unlike North America or Australia, Latin America was already home to large, complex civilisations before the arrival of the conquistadors, but major Spanish American cities are very much western from a cultural standpoint.",3ab6fe3405f9bc89d98395dfddbb30ad5a01a3cb,True,False,,,,,0,1648306784,,0,{},i275ym9,False,t3_tobvtn,False,True,t3_tobvtn,/r/geopolitics/comments/tobvtn/why_is_argentina_not_considered_a_western/i275ym9/,1648306799,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648277984.0,

I don't really see how that would solve that particular problem of governing at all.

For starters, a scientific degree may give you some decent knowledge in one specific field but it doesn't prepare you at all for the realities of governing. If anything there is a case to be made that it gives some people tunnel vision, such as with the issue with irrigation in China that the other user mentioned or their way over extended railroad system that is now a net detriment to them and an unnecessary money sink. Some theorize that one of the main contributing factors for those problems is the committees making those decisions are made up of people with only or mainly engineering degrees, so that's all they know.

Population relocations SHOULD never be necessary, but under a multi-polar world where governments are looking for any separatist sentiment to fund, groups of different ethnicity can be dangerous to the leadership of a country that's primarily of one ethnic background.    


Now population relocations and separatist movements are used like chess moves with no regard to the populations they affect, it's one of the most devastating things that can happen to a region. They're becoming more problematic as time goes on and great powers have growing animosity.   


Russia is using their Slavic population abroad as a cause for war while the USA uses the Kurds without a homeland to pressure Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey. Iran has a sizeable Azeri minority on their border, and recently there's been friction in the area where the two countries have been historically friendly. China is attempting to eliminate any Turkic influence in Xinxiang.   


Population displacement is devastating on people, but it can be an effective unethical tool for oligarchs to use to seize more land in power. Looking at things as cynically as possible, Russia wouldn't be able to occupy Ukraine if they hadn't reduced and displaced much of the Ukrainian and Polish populations during the Holodomor and States like Turkey wouldn't have the same land integrity today if the Young Turks hadn't done the Armenian genocide. Armenia would have a lot more support and ability to claim lands that are currently Turkey if there are tons of Armenians there.   


I guess my conclusion is that it's never good for the people, but it can often be good for the state, or a client state's controlling interest. Because the people seem to lack any significant power in any major state, I expect that population relocation and displacement will continue to be more widespread, more problematic, and more dire, particularly as the Middle East and Balkans are played as pawns between Russia and Nato.",66211a981cc48504f08fffac4f3fbaaa2134fe24,True,False,,,,,0,1648305660,,0,{},i273gpg,False,t3_tl4u2d,False,True,t1_i22iy0e,/r/geopolitics/comments/tl4u2d/do_mass_forced_expulsions_and_population/i273gpg/,1648305677,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648276860.0,

Generally at a minimum, the Western world is the EU/NATO/US/Canada, and loosely follows Cold War trends.

The reason LATAM often isn't included is because they were generally unaligned during the Cold War, and those countries by virtue of US hegemony and Monroe Doctrine don't really contribute much to global geopolitics.

I mean, \~650,000 people died in Iraq for a start, and the region was thrown into chaos.  That was pretty ""bad"", yes, and I think you're asking a lot of the European public if you want them to ignore that and throw their full weight behind the Iran War, or whatever adventure in the Middle East the US dreams up next. Especially given that the US just made a humilitating withdrawl from Afghanistan and is bound to leave Syria empty-handed soon. From a European perspective, America just seems to spend trillions doing very little other than playing whack-a-mole with extremist groups it unintentionally creates half-way across the world, killing hundreds of thousands as collateral in the process. I'd rather have a welfare state, thanks. Conversely, Ukraine is right on western Europe's doorstep. 

I also feel the need to mention, while most of these things weren't during America's unipolar moment, there is still plenty more than Iraq it has to be ashamed of. 2.5 million dead in Vietnam? 500,000 killed by the American-backed government of Indonesia? East Timor? Operation Condor? The Guatemalan genocide? Operation Ajax? The ongoing situation in Yemen? There are plenty of reasons why peace-loving people would be deeply distrustful of US power, especially when the ""stability"" it tends to create often looks like Libya. 

If the US wants Europe's trust, it needs to earn it, frankly, and that requires a lot more than keeping the oceans free of pirates. It might help if the US treated war and military coups as a last resort, rather than the first.

Which ""independence"" are you talking about? Japan invaded Korea to colonize them and the Qing came to help Korea at their request. China in that case did ""grant independence"" to Korea against Korea's will because Korea became a colony of Japan.

If you're referring to the Korean War, both ROC and then PRC were always ok with an independent Korea, no gun was ever held to their head. In fact they were ready to do nothing in the Korean War until Stalin convinced them to join in. 

This cost the PRC's chance to take Taiwan which the CPC always resented the USSR for and was one of the major signs of the Sino-Soviet split.

&gt;There was never a time the Chinese could take Japan or they would have.

To be fair, China (except for the Khan) was never interested in taking Japan because they viewed Japan as culturally inferior.

&gt;Same with Taiwan.

Ummm that's not historically accurate either. Taiwan was part of multiple dynasties. You would have learned this in our schools but oh wait you're not Taiwanese.

&gt;Various lands in China's south, west and north are conquered territories

Is it really conquered if the people from those lands had conquered and were ruling China? If they sinified themselves, it doesn't really count as expansionism.

&gt;China's last war was in Vietnam where they were routed.

I do think Vietnam is evidence of China's expansionism but this is such a poor example because this wasn't an expansionist campaign. They weren't coming to steal Vietnamese land or expand China, they invaded to stop Vietnam from continuing to invade a Chinese ally (tho I'm on Vietnam's side here).",9b92ce5dcd3e39989860779c967c986eda3c70ff,True,False,,,,,0,1648275506,,0,{},i25xkqp,False,t3_tnd1w5,False,True,t1_i22xauo,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnd1w5/china_and_solomon_islands_draft_secret_security/i25xkqp/,1648275518,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648246706.0,

You're missing the part where China called it a base. They literally called it a base but said that it would not be focused on the military but rather provide that nonmilitary support. But they still called it a base and signed a contract calling it a base.

Contrast that with the Soloman Islands which has no mention of any base.

This only supports my point that China is always very clear about getting a base because they want to be as legally protected in that realm as possible.

&gt;Sogavare has gone through several no-confidence votes throughout his tenure losing some of them and winning others, usually on claims of corruption and even madness and conspiracy theories, and often with rioting in the streets by people who are exasperated he keeps coming back somehow.

How is this related at all to the issue at hand? You do understand that countries, including China and Taiwan, will support whichever party is in power right?

Both China and Taiwan have supported this guy and members of his party monetarily.

&gt;he won [using a slush fund of Chinese cash to pay off MPs](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10280075/amp/Chinese-slush-fund-helps-Solomon-Islands-Prime-Minister-Manasseh-Sogavare-power.html).

Those MPs also got a slush fund from Taiwan, my country. This is a normal practice for countries to curry favor.

&gt;And by the way, Chinese are consuming Solomon Islands timber at [19 times the sustainable rate](https://news.mongabay.com/2018/10/chinese-demand-wiping-out-forests-in-the-solomon-islands-new-report/)

Ok that's bad but how is it relevant to the supposed base issue at hand?

&gt;Chinese are [bringing in their own workers](https://theislandsun.com.sb/you-want-2023/) to do the exclusive construction and engineering contracting. 

Your link says only 120 engineers are being brought to help with the engineering. You make it sound like the stadiums are being built with close to 100% Chinese labor. 

You honestly think several stadiums can be built with 120 Chinese engineers who've probably never done Manuel labor?

&gt;You should spend more time listening to local indigenous people in these places than you do listening to Chinese and taking them at their word.

Well I don't listen to the Chinese propaganda. I listen to actual empirical data. And actual empirical data frankly beats out anecdotes. That's not to day that China isn't doing bad things but just that you need better evidence than some guy saying stuff has changed.

&gt;&gt;Peter Iroga, owner of a local construction company Best Builders, [says that everything has changed since Chinese companies started operating in the Solomon Islands](https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/china-and-nz/300508301/china-rejects-accusations-it-is-setting-debt-traps-all-around-the-pacific).

If we're talking about the Soloman Islands, which is the issue at hand, there is no major Chinese debt problem as you've described. Not even your source backs it up.

Your source talks about the supposed debt trap example of the Sri Lankan port which has been disproved many times over by multiple acclaimed political scientists such as Deborah Bratuigum who've I've had the pleasure of working with.

Debt sustainability is an issue but the way your article is describing ""debt trap"" is a fringe opinion in political science studies.

&gt;8 and 10 percent GDP debt load to the Chinese, which is really what we're looking at when you look at the hidden debt the Chinese [often employ in their BRI investment model](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-debt-plagues-chinas-belt-and-road-infrastructure-plan-studies-find-11632866461),

It really isn't. Debt levels of even 10% *is* sustainable. Debt levels of 50% or course are not. When Taiwan and Korea wers a developing country for example and trying to escape the middle income trap, their debt to GDP ratio was almost consistently above 10%. Same with Singapore. 

This is because countries need to borrow money in order to modernize and become more competitive. Of course, 50% is not sustainable but saying 10% is too much is a fringe economic theory that's only held by extreme Republicans.

&gt;I think you said you recently graduated college

I did not.

&gt;Chinatowns in Tonga, Indonesia and previous instances in Honiara burned before you were born

How are you still justifying anti-Chinese racism? If you know any history, you'll know that Chinese-Indonesians with family histories rooted in Indonesia and no relation to the PRC were literally massacred because the government associated them with communism. 

Let me repeat this. You're justifying a government attacking a group of people (who were citizens!) just because of where their ancestors came from decades if not centuries ago. Literally the same logic that the US gov used to intern Japanese Americans.

&gt;you should ask yourself what other people in Asia have their own towns full of workers living in Fiji, Java and Vanuatu

Wow imagine depicting Chinatowns are just towns of foreigners. You're just perpetuating even more anti-Chinese sentiment and unrepentedly it seems.

&gt;And now they want to bring in their military and police to crack the heads of locals who are legitimately upset about it, after buying off the local politicians.

Sogavare has gone through several no-confidence votes throughout his tenure losing some of them and winning others, usually on claims of corruption and even madness and conspiracy theories, and often with rioting in the streets by people who are exasperated he keeps coming back somehow. In 2019 he was elected again amidst widespread controversy, a court-issued injunction and more rioting, and one of the first things he did back in office was switch recognition to China and [grant logging and mining rights to the Chinese](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/01/analysts-point-to-logging-and-mining-to-explain-solomon-islands-unrest/amp/). Solomon Islanders are obviously not happy with Sogavare selling out their country and its resources to Chinese, so there was unrest, Chinatown was burned and another no confidence vote came up in December that he won [using a slush fund of Chinese cash to pay off MPs](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10280075/amp/Chinese-slush-fund-helps-Solomon-Islands-Prime-Minister-Manasseh-Sogavare-power.html).

And by the way, Chinese are consuming Solomon Islands timber at [19 times the sustainable rate](https://news.mongabay.com/2018/10/chinese-demand-wiping-out-forests-in-the-solomon-islands-new-report/) and Chinese are [bringing in their own workers](https://theislandsun.com.sb/you-want-2023/) to do the exclusive construction and engineering contracting. 

[According to locals]:

&gt; Peter Iroga, owner of a local construction company Best Builders, [says that everything has changed since Chinese companies started operating in the Solomon Islands](https://i.stuff.co.nz/national/china-and-nz/300508301/china-rejects-accusations-it-is-setting-debt-traps-all-around-the-pacific).

&gt; “Chinese companies have the resources (material) to work, they have the company to manipulate the system and cheaper labourers to do the work. We locals can’t compete,” he says.

&gt; He says that this is going to have long-term effects as local firms are going to find it harder to keep businesses running, and more qualified builders will become unemployed.

You should spend more time listening to local indigenous people in these places than you do listening to Chinese and taking them at their word. These are poor developing countries with a lot of people who are struggling, you cannot compare them to Australia. 8 and 10 percent GDP debt load to the Chinese, which is really what were looking at when you look at the hidden debt the Chinese [often employ in their BRI investment model](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-debt-plagues-chinas-belt-and-road-infrastructure-plan-studies-find-11632866461), is something Solomon Islands can ill afford, particularly when it's handing over precious raw materials that are being way over harvested to Chinese.

None of this should come as a surprise. I think you said you recently graduated college -- the Chinese have been doing this in southeast Asia since before you were born. Chinatowns in Tonga, Indonesia and previous instances in Honiara burned before you were born. Since you like whataboutism, you should ask yourself what other people in Asia have their own towns full of workers living in Fiji, Java and Vanuatu. And now they want to bring in their military and police to crack the heads of locals who are legitimately upset about it, after buying off the local politicians. People who want to know what the Chinese investment model is going to look like in Africa can refer to southeast Asia for a preview.",a0cac004a6504329a41866f38d833f1cb0c73e82,True,False,,,,,0,1648272292,,0,{},i25tcmb,False,t3_tnd1w5,False,True,t1_i23apjl,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnd1w5/china_and_solomon_islands_draft_secret_security/i25tcmb/,1648272304,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648243492.0,

This is, frankly, a load of revisionist nonsense. What Russia has done is not to scale back their goals, it's to reaffirm the same goals they've been affirming from the start while disowning goals that outside commentators have ascribed to them. They are not backing down, they are standing firm.

So far as I know, Russia has never once stated that a conquest of Ukraine was one of their goals, and in fact have denied it on at least one occasion. Their actual stated goals, which have thus far remained wholly consistent all throughout the invasion and even from before, are demilitarization, neutralization, ""denazification"", and the liberation and Ukrainian recognition of the Donbass republics, which, if you'll remember, was the original reason given to justify the ""military operation"" folowing the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics and their calling for Putin's help.

That's the problem with alliances between authoritarian regimes. A relationship based on strategy and not shared values means that its inherently shaky and even if one depends on the other, doesn't mean the dependent will do what they're said.

Correct.

&gt;So unless the Crimeans have been consistently lying and being threatened by Russian forces since 2008, there's a strong case to be made that the 2014 vote was of dubious integrity but more than likely legitimate nonetheless.

Similarly, the results of the 1938 Austrian referendum to ratify the *Anschluss* by Germany really did reflect widespread enthusiasm among Austrians (contrary to the postwar ""First victim"" propaganda); Germans and Austrians both believed that annexation fixed a historical error that had unwarrantedly kept Austrians apart from fellow Germans, and that Pan-Germanism was now a reality.

&gt;To deny Crimean self-determination is contrary to Western values, unless of course its to do with a power the west doesn't agree with.

The principle of self-determination, as articulated by Wilson's Fourteen Principles a century ago, is very difficult to reconcile with condemning too heavily the Russian majority of Crimea seeking to leave Ukraine and rejoining Russia.

I don't have problem with the principle that a country has broad latitude to handle internal affairs in its own way.

Nor a country, within limits, seeking to project power in its neighborhood.

The current invasion of Ukraine is different. It's more akin to the German invasion of rump Czechoslovakia after receiving the Sudetenland; the latter could plausibly be described as another ""fix"" of Pan-Germanism. The former could not.

At least Hitler could cite *lebensraum* for Czechoslovakia. But no one thinks that Russia, whose population is shrinking anyway, needs more space. The only two things I can think of are:

* Russia feels the need to expand its borders and build buffer zones as much as possible before its demographic crisis really hits in a decade and the country can no longer staff its military. (Peter Zeihan has talked about this for years.)

1) How did the Australian government allow this to happen? Australia doesn't officially have an equivalent to the Monroe Doctrine, but I feel like there would be an unspoken sense that the South Pacific is our sphere of influence and outside influence will be seen as aggression. Was the Foreign Minister aware that these negotiations were taking place? And what alternatives did Australia offer to prevent the SI from going down this path.

2) How desperate is China that it's looking for alliances with the Solomon Islands? The only trade which can be blocked if they station ships there is from Australia and New Zealand. Is that goal really worth the increased hostility from Australia?

The Islands are not very politically unified, so eventually the Chinese will have to deploy troops to crush another uprising like there was in 2021. This will only further push public sentiment in Australia against the CCP, meaning all future governments regardless of party are going to have to be adversial to China.

3) This is not good news for the people of the Solomon Islands. The previous unrest was ostensibly caused by dissatisfaction with their government getting closer to China. If further unrest occurs, support from China is not going to be contingent on the SI government behaving ""democratically"". Indeed with the money and support only dependent on the SI government holding power, expect repression to grow in the country.


All of this leads to the questions, will domestic hostility increase in the SI if this deal goes through? If the Chinese are called in to quash the uprising how harsh will the crackdown be? And if the Chinese begin acts of violence against the people of the Solomon Islands, will Australia intervene militarily?

Crimea having secessionist secessionist does not in and of itself lead to a need for independence. As you note, no one is really too worried about Scotland seeking independence or Catalonia for that matter. What the West often takes umbrage with is the ""how"" rather than the ""what."" Westerners are very sympathetic to Palestinians wanting to be independent, but are often repulsed by the tactics used (suicide bombs, rocket attacks on cities, etc.).

If Crimea under the supervision of either Ukraine or the UN had voted to secede from Ukraine on its own, and it wasn't seen as merely a proxy move by Russia, I think it generally would have been supported. Direct Russian involvement changes everything, and not just because of the possibility of a misleading vote.

Consider Catalonia again. A referendum in 2017 for independence was declared illegal by the Spanish Supreme Court, but it appeared to be quite popular in the region. This caused a great deal of unrest, and initially the national government handled the situation rather gruffly. Conflict seemed possible, but since 2018 Catalan polling suggests that independence is now not supported. A large piece of this appears to be the Spanish government striking a more reconciliatory tone with Catalans, working to solve their differences instead of inflaming them. There is suspicion of Russian interference too by the way, but let's not worry about that.

Imagine if France had chosen to send soldiers into Catalonia at that moment.

Catalonia ended up reconciling with Spain despite secessionist sympathies. Seceding is a scary process for what would often be a very small country, and it isn't easy to be successful at. Just because a region wants to leave a country does not mean they will go through with it in the end. See the UK leaving the EU on relatively friendly terms and what a mess that his been—and the UK is an actual functioning nation with a very long history of independence.

I am suggesting here that Ukraine and Crimea never received a fair chance at reconciling their differences due to the intervention of Russia.

In February 2014, it probably seemed to many people in Ukraine that the country was coming apart at the seams. It is easy in such a moment to think that hitching up with a bigger, stronger country is the correct thing to do. Even assuming the Russian soldiers did nothing to influence the vote (we are always right to suspect Russia), the relationship between Crimea and Ukraine was irrevocable interfered with by a foreign power. Reconciliation became impossible, and for Crimea there was no longer a need to weigh possibilities and outcomes.

Now the West did not necessarily disagree with the notion that Crimea wanted to be part of Russia, and this is probably part of the reason why sanctions in 2014 were not nearly as strong as the current sanctions. I'm not sure that in 2014 if the West really thought Ukraine was going survive either.

Anyways, I'm sure you can find some example of the West being hypocritical, but I think the intervention of the Russian military largely renders your examination of Crimea as purely separatist-driven moot.",3ae6643a638649d48252dfb73ed36033b1ba7188,True,False,,,,,0,1648259230,,0,{},i256ecs,False,t3_tnsul2,False,True,t3_tnsul2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnsul2/what_determines_international_support_for_certain/i256ecs/,1648259248,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648230430.0,
