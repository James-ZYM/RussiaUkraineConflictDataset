\- russia's military use in crimea was a response to ukraine's intention to join NATO and their decision to ban russian language (i'm not sure if that law has been applied but just the fact that they wanted to pass it in the parliament is enough to create hostility between the two nations) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUe5vW8UM6M

\- Russia asked for a guarantee besides the treaty to prevent missiles deployement in close regions to it's territory.

\- whether they like it or not, ukranians and russians are the same people. they share history and culture. zielensky's goal was to end that cuz he thought that ukraine should have it's own identity and it will be better for them economically to be a part of EU which i personally think it's wrong for two reasons. first u can have more benefits by becoming closer to both sides and second if EU was that good Uk wouldn't have left it.

\-  i didn't fully understand ur point about germany but since u mentioned that country i think that they have the best strategy to deal with russia cuz they know damn well that EU and russia need each other. germany's plan is to keep russia close and dependant on EU. (russia exports approximately 40% of gaz to EU)  

\- sanctions will end up with two bad results : either u cause chaos in a country that posses nuclear weapons or if that didn't happen and putin kept the country under control russia will seak to abandon their relations with the west and become closer to eastern countries like china so in the short run russia will suffer greatly but after it's all over putin will look for other economical partners which will backfire at EU.

\- i still doubt that putin wants to occupy ukraine and not just change the regime since like i said that will be nearly impossible and i'm sure putin knows that not to mention that sanctions will make it x1000 times harder for him. maybe his plan is that if his army can't continue the battle he will stick to changing regime (ukranians will resist that change for sure) but if they managed to break resistance in a short time then he will try to occupy the whole country.",bd51ac320535059fcb17b39013eb42fce5756f3c,True,False,,,,,0,1646667618,,0,{},hzpppil,False,t3_t84e4f,False,True,t1_hzpfygt,/r/war/comments/t84e4f/anyone_genuinely_on_the_russian_sidewhy_im/hzpppil/,1646667629,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646638818.0,[],text,t2_6clolimn,False,False,

To be honest it would be smarter for Ukrainians to abandon parts Donetsk and Lughansk, but it is politically unfeasible for any country to withdraw from their own territory just to appease aggressor, nor it was been successful in history - and Putin didn\`\`\`t want to take risk to make any ultimatum to withdraw from Donets and Lughans territory. That why he put some not possible demands from west.

You might be surprised, but it is closer to Moscow from Tallin, than from Donetsk. So this  Cuban-crisis comparison made by Russian propaganda is simple nonsense. The USA don\`t have nuclear bases in whole CEE, nor they need too.

Here is 4+2 treaty: [https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/germany-europe/two-plus-four-treaty](https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/germany-europe/two-plus-four-treaty)

Here is 1997 charter where Russia accepted NATO expansion:

https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official\_texts\_25468.htm

Please find me any mention about NATO eastward expansion ban.

It is obvious that Putin want to conquer Ukraine, because for him Ukrainians are little lost Russian created by Lenin. Of course he might keep some disguise and made puppet state with some dictator like Belarus or in fact Chechenya after carving out Donetsk and Luhansk oblast but still as part of Russkiy Mir.  The best confirmation is how poor Russian prepared itself for war - he simply didn't expected true resistance.

It is obvious that Putin dream is to recreate tsarists empire. Well Russia economy is not German so he only have tanks, gas and oil. It seems no democratic society is ready to trade its freedom for the latter and dreams about joining EU.

In 1947, when NATO was founded, most of Eastern Europe was still Soviet-occupied and not formally declared countries, likewise with Western Europe. Countries such as France and Italy became capitalist-aligned and were economically reliant on the U.S. to rebuild, while the same was true with Eastern Europe. 

Molotov was smart enough to realize that NATO was anti-communist, but applied anyways to avoid the Soviet Union becoming internationally isolated as they were before the war. 

Also, from the Soviet perspective, they were the leaders of global communism, so it was only natural that other communist countries should follow their line. They were expected to do so, but it's not like they were entirely puppets. There was often friction between the USSR and Warsaw Pact countries, for trading with Western countries or policies implemented - most of which went ignored with the exception of once in Czechoslovakia and once in Hungary. Romania entirely deviated from the Soviet socialist line yet remained a big trading partner with them until 1990.

But that doesn't change the fact that the West is keeping their promises for Ukraine. I still do not believe they would help us, keep the promises they made to us. They have committed numerous crimes in the past, blame others even tho they haven't fully fixed their past mistakes (talking mainly about all the coups from South America to Iran i would talk about Agent Orange but if I'm not wrong they actually spent a lot of money trying to help Vietnam with that problem i would talk about Iraq and Afghanistan as well but i don't know much about American or Western crimes in there except for a few videos that I've seen).

There is other stuff like how America refused to give us AA defences and then got mad when we bought AA from Russia and USA after that event kicked us out of the F-35 program and refused to give us our F-16s and F-35s. I don't even want to mention how the world doesn't care about the wars in Africa or Syria and just act as if nothing is going on in these regions. Our Western ""allies"" have put sanctions on us in the past which wasn't the only reason but it was one of the reasons for our economys collapse. Now they are doing the same to Russia as someone who went through sanctions i can say that the sanctions don't hurt the government they hurt the people. Some people in here killed themselves because they could not afford to pay their bills and guess what they are not here any longer while the government is still here.

Other then all of this shit there is the PKK too. An internationally recognized terrorist organization that has been fighting with my country for the past 30+ years. And guess who arms and supports these guys ? Is supporting internationally recognized terrorist organizations, arming these organizations and allowing them to kill civilians and soldiers of an allied nation something ""normal"" in the West's eyes ? Mind you the West always complains about how we treat the Kurds and then they arm a terrorist group that kills both Turkish and Kurdish civilians and soldiers. What is the West complaining about exactly ? They are mad because we can't remove a problem they started ?

I'm not even gonna get into Armenia. These people want land and money from us. Why the hell would we, a foreign and free nation, give our land and money to another foreign and free nation ? These people oppress our brothers in Azerbaijan while the West acts as if everything is normal and as soon as we try to do something everyone starts screaming ""look at those barbarians"" we offered a deal to the Armenians. Both Turkish and Armenian researchers would dive into the archives and uncover the truth. Guess who rejected that offer ? And they still blame us after all this ? 

Im not saying that the Eastern world is any better unfortunately the highest quality of life is in the West and that makes me really sad. The West got powerful because they broke every rule they could in the past. Colonizing ? The West did that and now the Communist China is trying to colonize some islands for itself now i absolutely hate China but do you know what i hate more ? The fact that the Western world blames China while ignoring the fact that the West used to do the same shit in the past. Again i hate China i don't want people to think i like them or support them i just want people to see that West lies and back stabs other nations just as much as the East.

With all of this i don't understand why i should ever support the Western nations. I've been seeing people telling us that we don't belong to NATO for years and now all of a sudden with the Ukranian-Russian war people are acting as if we were best buddies all along. They showed all sorts of shit down our throats and now they act as if they didn't do anything wrong and always supported us. When the war is over the West will go back to hating us and telling us we don't belong in the EU and we must be kicked out of NATO. Why would I trust the West when all of this stuff has happened ?",a1a37299063a13cabf711a6230e1c8daa2b89c63,True,True,,,,,0,1646660163,,0,{},hzp9j79,False,t3_t84e4f,False,True,t1_hzoq9eu,/r/war/comments/t84e4f/anyone_genuinely_on_the_russian_sidewhy_im/hzp9j79/,1646660175,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646631363.0,[],text,t2_14lpcd,False,False,

And Lets be real here if Russia wanted to take Ukraine he would have done it in a day or so. if they Really Saw/wanted Ukraine as their own this invasions should have started a Long time ago (I'm Talking about Young Putin like 10 years ago)

Putin/Russia isn't even trying invading Ukraine. He's sending equipment and soldiers like the worst possible way in modern times almost like hes not even serious about it nor care about the war. Let's get into Facts here. Ukraine doesn't have a strong Army/marine and Air, Ukraine didn't even had enough Military equipment to start with. Russia alone stands in 2th places (but is slowly decending and is one of the main reasons why the war started and a new Leader can improve Russia's military power) so why isn't this war over in like a day and Ukraine in Putins hand?? Because Putin planned this and doing it for Russia future Leader. Russia has alot of growing to do and with Putin in charge its not going to, even before the war started they couldn't freely trade with western Because USA stopped them from doing business.

So to put theory small US and Nato and Zelensky pushed Russia--putin starts war---gets Sanctioned to hell---New Leader--- western happy---Russia's economy up again--- everyone's happy.

I also see many messages in this war, Hypocrisy,lots of propaganda/miss information etc... witb Hypocrisy in everyone's mind is the main reason I decided not to pick sides here.
Don't get me wrong but it's true and accept it.

Anyway thx for reading my theory, stay save.

As for ""is RU holding back"", I would have been concerned about the very same thing, except for two important indicators: 

1. Where their infantry engage, they perform like shit. There's a lot of reports of RU infantry surrendering *en masse*. While not 100% reliable, I'm willing to lend tentative credence to these due to where I've seen them from. Additionally, TMK there have been at least *FOUR* separate VDV (RU airborne, 1 step shy of special forces) assaults that have been wiped to a man. You don't burn your shock troops on an unsupported attack.
2. Shit logistics. They can't even supply their *supply trucks* to get them to the front line.

517,[],False,,benjitheboy,,,,,,"I am fervently in favor of Russia winning this thing quickly. for context, I'm an american leftist with a libertarian bent. My general reasoning is: 

1) Russia is trying to deal with territorial issues with places that broke off in 1991. The fall of the Soviet union wasn't a peaceful dissolution of partners, it was shattered by the west. The concept that because the world is a way now, therefore it must be this way forever because THAT'S HOW AMERICA WANTS IT is not sustainable. Regardless of Putin and his intentions, which i assume are indeed imperialistic and distasteful - Russia's claim to the territory it claims in Ukraine is as legitimate as any of the sham borders set up by the western powers for the middle east and Africa, that have kept those regions racked by ethnic conflict since decolonization. 

2) if we take nations at face value, Putin truly is acting within international standards. Defending ethnic Russians receiving poor treatment in Ukraine is as good a reason as any nation has ever had for invading another. I believe the US has done it more than once. Again, it's not that i trust Putin. it's that we CANNOT treat another nuclear power with standards that we don't use ourselves. it's these types of actions that breed resentment and get populaces on board for more conflict. This situation reminds me precisely of Germany pre-wwii. Russia lost the cold war, and for 30 years has been continuously pushed back and isolated, with any action to reclaim lost territory taken with international backlash while the western powers continue to use their military to enforce their world order wherever they see fit. 

3) Lastly, and most importantly, i don't want people to die. US guns will only kill more people. US planes will only kill more people. I'm sorry for Ukrainians who may see their homes transferred to Russian nationhood, but at the same time... their homes will still be there. Russia isn't planning on initiating a holocaust on Ukrainians. I get that borders aren't nothing but I sure as hell don't think that the US should be pumping death machines into Ukraine just to kill Russian boys and breed more resentment from a nuclear power.",b99f12529884e2a1ce8a4b4c29b76571d9462659,True,False,,,,,0,1646629936,,0,{},hzo3uvq,False,t3_t84e4f,False,True,t3_t84e4f,/r/war/comments/t84e4f/anyone_genuinely_on_the_russian_sidewhy_im/hzo3uvq/,1646629951,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646601136.0,[],text,t2_kgg32c7,False,False,

The answer is mentality and psychology. A Russian is a friendly fellow who thinks that all other people are weirdos and smiles at them with a little bit of superiority. He takes competition very seriously. If something goes not his way he easily becomes ired, but he also easily forgives and forgets. He doesn't care much about his wealth and can't really collect money for years for retirement, he prefers do spend them now - YOLO. Russian guy is brave and play fast and loose (любит авантюры). He is a good friend when you respect him, but can hit you when you argue. He likes to be led by good and strict tzar who knows what to do the best, can yell, but loves his people. 

A Ukrainian guy likes to live without a boss who tells him what to do. He thinks that he himself knows what's best, and this is mostly personal stuff : home, garden, family. That's why Ukrainians often are in anarchy and often riot - means the aithority is not capable in his opinion. A Ukrainian would hoard good staff and keep in handy, take care of his estate, but doesn't love very much to share. Ukrainians like their neighbours because they're not warlike.

So, you see, Russia as USSR was great, but tables turned. They miss the times they were strong and respected. They don't care so much about wealth and money. They rather spend it on show off (tanks, air carriers). Their leader is strong, and they follow him. Until they will be bitterly disappointed one day.

But instead of saying they were in case Russia attacks they say they are for defending NATO countries. The thing about these defensive missile silos is that they can be converted to offensive in a few hours. Also the bombs that took out Hiroshima and Nagasaki only weighed 9700 lbs back in the 1940’s. A light truck could tow that to the silo. 

The scary thing for Putin is having missiles close enough to Moscow that they won’t have time to react and prevent them from blowing up the capital. Also if NATO is in Ukraine they will be able to put trucks with missiles and surface to air capabilities dangerously close to the capital. Which will prevent them from having air support in the region if someone were to decide to invade. Will also enable NATO to potentially be able to shoot missiles into his capital from both trucks and their new silo.

NATO and the United States are giving Ukraine millions and billions to be able to set up the missile systems and aim them at Russia. This whole thing comes down to Putin protecting his people and Ukraine selling theirs out. None of this would happen if Ukraine didn’t take the money. Putin can’t allow anyone to point weapons at millions of his people and not react. It’s the exact same situation as the Cuban Missile Crisis, just reversed the roles. Russia tried to put weapons in Cuba and aim them at the US and the govt couldn’t allow it.

Here's my point of view: 

- ukraine joining NATO is really a threat to russia national security and it'srelations with the countries on it's borders.

As to sanctions, I don't know, I think the fight that's been put up and the very visible civilian casualties might mean sanctions stick around now, at least I'd hope so. But if you'd have asked me before all this I'd have said 6 months max. If you want to see if they're going to last longer look for things that signify attempting to wean off russian energy, like Germany keeping its nuclear power plants open, the UK starting to approve fracking, stuff like that. If that happens it suggests they're trying to isolate the Russians long term.

But I was one of those people who thought Putin was sabre rattling, didn't figure the troop build up was anything to worry about as massive exercises are part of their conscript training timeline. Only started getting apprehensive when there were field hospitals deployed in Belarus, even then figured it was most likely to be a bluff so honestly what do I know about how long sanctions will last!

I'd suggest skimming the Wikipedia and seeing if any of the concepts catch your interest. The 'Christian tradition' influenced today's international law more, by virtue of Europe being the main driver of international law and human rights theories.

Also, you (as a soldier) saw war from the angle of the warfighter. Warfighters must be able to do many things that civilians could never do. Warfighters are the ones who carry out the combat that serves the political objectives. They are expected to be killers, and in many countries that is the only thing that they are taught. But since the Geneva Conventions were adopted after World War 2, soldiers and their political leaders are also expected to do more than just win. Our troops take classes to learn what is a valid target during war (a tank, a military base) and what isn't (an ambulance, a hospital) and violating the rules often constitutes a crime. And if political leaders give orders to break these laws, they are also at risk of being held accountable... but this happens less often because international law is fairly weak at this stage.

Finally, Genghis Khan and Alexander are typically remembered today for the accomplishments of creating large empires and contributing to the development of civilization. Today, we generally don't praise the Mongol use of human shields or biological warfare, or the Greeks subjugating entire peoples.

I think russia is going to encircle the eastern UA forces (i dont have UA numbers, but it was alwaS said, that is where most and their best troops are). Then they are going to complete encirclements of charkow, mariupol, kiev. 
They captured 2 of the UAs 4 NPPs, they have then 3 options.

1) Storm the city and fet heavy inf losses, dont know if they win, but would be a bloodbath for both sides.
2) sent an ultimatum to the cities to surrender or demolish it with arty (once safe artillery positions are established).
3) turn off power and water, i ""heard"" that then waste water would mix with drinking water, but even if not, this would give the cities i assume few weeks at most, they will surrender i bet then.
