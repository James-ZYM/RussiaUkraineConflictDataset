Nuclear attack isn't very useful as it will only kill civilians and get the western powers roped into the war. 
Chemical weapons also aren't useful as they have no targets and don't have adequate protection for their own troops. 

Other reasons this isn't a false flag:

It's actually critical military infrastructure that Russia wouldn't destroy.
Russia false flags usually target civilians
They did it with low flying helicopters and not a missile or artillery strike. This makes Ukraine look like a skillful airpower that can strike anywhere within Russia undetected. That isn't something Russia would create a narrative about.

Berlin has given the green light for 56 vehicles of the type PbV-501 to be passed on from a Czech company to Kyiv, a spokesman for the defence ministry said on Friday.

He was responding to requests for confirmation of a media report that said 58 vehicles armed with canons and machine guns were to be supplied to Ukraine.

Berlin passed the IFVs on to Sweden at the end of the 1990s, which later sold them to a Czech company that now aims to sell them to Kyiv, according to Welt am Sonntag newspaper.

[],False,,poster457,,,[],,,,text,t2_3m8xbdse,False,False,"I can explain it in one word. Demographics.

In more detail, almost every country on earth isn't having enough children to replace themselves with the exception of sub-Saharan African nations, and even their growth is slowing. Nigeria has already passed 200 million people and still maintains the highest birth rates on earth (along with nearby Niger) at around 7 children per mother (it used to be above 12!), and with China soon to report its first year of population decline, on current trends Nigeria will almost certainly become more populous than China by the end of the century.

The causes for population decline are actually quite well understood as being mostly attributed to women's education, women's equality, financial prosperity and access to contraceptives. Some studies also suggest that urbanization and the size of motor vehicles being limited to families of 5 is another factor. But when women are educated and have rights to enter the workforce as equals with men, they tend to choose financial independence and travel which forces them to put off marriage and/or children until their 30's. This does not leave much time to make a large family even IF they desired it. In fact, if you live in the west, you probably know more women upset that they left it too late to have children than you know young women with more than 3 children. FYI, just to maintain a population, women need to have anywhere from 2.2 - 3 children per mother on average. Western and most Asians nations aren't even close to that, averaging around 1.5 children per mother.

Learning about demographics reveals a powerful truth about the why of world such as why western countries have such high immigration from Asian and African countries and why they outsource so much to China and India. Demographics also grant a predictive power such as China being unable to maintain its economic/population growth, the rise of India for a while, to be followed by Nigeria late this century.",3f1a9a0abd1c2e244b4cedc84292ca4a504cbac7,True,False,,,,,0,1648780459,,0,{},i2xmvwe,False,t3_tt9y9y,False,True,t1_i2x92zd,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tt9y9y/russia_foreign_minister_sergey_lavrov_a_new/i2xmvwe/,1648780473,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648751659.0,

According to Google translate, the lyrics are:-

[Verse 1]
A Muscovite was walking in the woods
Looking for an adventure
The sun
shone from the sky Beautiful pagoda!
Suddenly it rang
And the earth shook Bolvanka
flew to
the young Muscovite!

[Chorus]
And no
Muscovite No Muscovite!
There is no fuck at all
The raw land itself The
artillery
is working The boys are fucking With one katsap
less And
the second shit in his pants

[Verse 2] A Muscovite
sits in a trench
And holds
a Kalash In his knees


[Chorus]
And no
Muscovite No Muscovite!
There is no fuck at all The raw land itself The artillery is working The boys are fucking With one
katsap
less
And the
second shit in
his pants

[Couplet 3] Before the column
of equipment
Pskov paratrooper
And in the bushes sat Muscovite! There is no fuck at all The raw earth itself The artillery works The boys fuck One katsap less And the second shit in his pants

[Verse 4 ] The
Katsap Mortar
Unit was
standing . [Chorus] And no Muscovite No Muscovite! There is no fuck at all The wet land itself The artillery is working The boys are fucking One katsap less And the second shit in his pants And no Muscovite No Muscovite! There is no fuck at all The raw earth itself The artillery works The boys fuck One katsap less And the second shit in his pants

I can tell you it doesn't nor does your massive army or air force. The US navy is constantly patrolling all the world's oceans and seas to keep trade flowing,yes that is FREE trade. Like wise the huge army is all over the world training various forces so they are able to protect their own freedom, you see that FREEDOM. 

Now don't get me wrong I'm by no means the biggest fan of American foreign policy ( and that's putting it politely) but I am sure as hell glad that they are the ones doing this. Without the US in this role the world would be a lot less stable and a lot less free.
