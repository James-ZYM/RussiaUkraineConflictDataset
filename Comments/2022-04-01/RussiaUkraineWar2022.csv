No need to escalate and put NATO forces in harms way, Russia is doing a good enough job of that on their own.

A few other thoughts I have had in the oases few weeks of the invasion ......

1 NATO is categorical, no boots on the ground. Could the special forces of certain nations however be taking part in some form, recon, training, tactics, coordination, etc?

2 How China views its ""partnership"" with Russia now? If as a sizeable military power, would it want to be associated with the current Russian shitshow? I don't know many people who would want to be associated with or be on the losing side. NATO is ploughing masses of ""defensive"" weaponry in to help Ukraine who unfortunately are then losing their lives in this massive defense.

3. Russians don't do humiliation. If NATO joined the conflict, that would galvanise the Russian people and escalation would be inevitable akin to Stalingrad. Being humiliated by Ukraine ......

- opportunity to get Finland and Sweden into NATO
- Ukraine stays a democratic nation and hopefully closer to NATO
- Russia is humiliated and the Russian people press for leadership change

4. Biden stated the need for regime change which his press people backtracked on over the ensuing days. But I am sure there are conversations in the intelligence fields with Russian counterparts on what the Russia of tomorrow should look like. 

5. The wealth of ""secret"" intell in advance of actions to be taken by Putin. So much and so accurate, a lot has to be coming from inside the Kremlin. The intell keeps coming albeit we hear that Putski has changed has cleaned house and has senior people under house arrest. So Putskis actions haven't found the root cause of the info as yet. The whole strategy is to help the irrationality and paranoia within the Kremlin to help it implode.

Combating russian aggression with sanctions currently at the moment I believe it's the only viable option to avoid this war spreading.

In order to decimate Russia in Ukraine they need air superiority. And unfortunately they won't get that anytime soon. But that can change. A no fly zone over Ukraine will provoke Russia into attacking NATO possibly.

Their military is proving to be very incompetent in all arms conflicts. Their major problems are supplies and fuel and food and water. A lot of their conscripts lack discipline of being a professional soldier. But that could be said about a lot of their military. Which is advantageous for Ukraine.

If we provoke Russia into a NATO lead conflict it will definitely lead to at least one russian nuclear strike in my opinion. I hope I am wrong about that. However Russia believes that if there's a world without Russia then the world isnt worth existing. Could that ideology lead to a nuclear war? And global devastation? I don't know. I don't think it's worth finding out.

Russia will never purge corruption from their government and military because the ones that benefit are the ones in power. Russia will learn from this mistake and maybe modernize their army and tactics. But the changes will be slow because of the corruption in their military and government. They want the money to go to them and not the military.

Engaging Russia will lead to a very costly war on both sides.

I would imagine that field like this (I saw the field on one other video with ppl in civilian cars driving around/between the mines) could be very effective if laid in front of, say, check point, in a direct view of troops guarding that checkpoint...

&amp;#x200B;

at, say, 200 meters, troops can't defuse, or even kick the mines of the way, but armoured vehicles have to stay a bit further back (arguably much less of a problem on today's battlefield) and the supporting fire from them may be a bit less accurate. and you have to stop advancing and absolutely HAVE to clear that checkpoint to be able to defuse the mines.  


other use for such obvious use may be to stop convoy, if even for two/three minutes, to spring an ambush...

&amp;#x200B;

or just stopping advancing enemy advance for a few minutes may buy you time to blow up a bridge, runaway to the forest, lose contact and disengage...

- The destruction of some oil depots do not even really constitute a good casus belli to escalate. It's a legit military target. If it was a false flag, it would make more sense if the targets were civilians (to spark outrage).

- Ukraine 111% has the right to strike inside russia to defend itself. Are people suggesting that this is wrong on any level ? At this point, Ukraine could bomb Moscow and still be justified in its actions imo (it won't because it doesn't act like russia which is very honorable but Ukraine has a right to defend itself by all means if it comes to that). Once again, it's not like striking Belarus. Russia is completly part of the conflict obviously.

- It's apparently very close to the front and Karkhiv. Only a very short fly. So it's definitely possible.

why has Kharkiv survived? Because the Russian army sucks. They’ve been fighting for days in a must win battle at Izium or whatever it is called and they are not winning.   


as the fighting settles down up north you can expect more and more Ukrainian reinforcements to head towards Donbas.   


putin just announced conscripting 134,000 new troops. Sound like a lot? It’s not enough to conquer Ukraine. No way. Ukrainians could call up at least that number next week.

guess who will run out of aircraft and armored vehicles in another month of fighting? Russia cannot replace their equipment losses and there is no evidence that the Ukrainians are going to slow down on destroying them. Stinger missiles are probably heading to Donbas right now, expect to see lots of Russian aircraft lost there over the weekend.

if the Ukrainians decide to really continue this fight, with Western support, they’ll drive the Russians out of Donbas and Crimea in six months or less.

including sick, wounded and dead the Russians have lost about 25% of their invading army and they are losing the war very badly. The idea that they are going to “regroup” and add in some cooks and mechanics and middle aged reservists and somehow start winning is just not realistic…

I don't know, but it looks more like a new system than an update of the grom. The stats look great, it's a bit heavier with more range. But I don't know how effective it is, as in how many proper shots do actually get an aircraft down. With a system with longer range, you can do the job with less firing units. Or protect a larger area. Or have a denser deployment of the firing units.

And even though I was trained on the stinger missile, we didn't get much of information about it, because lots of it is classified. And I never used one with a warhead, so... I am by no means a specialist on the system itself, but I was as a shooter. I do mostly know how to keep your unit motivated when you're somewhere in the shitter at sub zero temperatures and stare at the sky for a week :P

From what I've read, Poland delivered some Pioruns to Ukraine and they got some aircraft down with it.

It's impossible to be exact, but it's certainly a **very low percentage**, as Putin has shut down any source of media that is not 100% pro-kremlin. Here is a recent poll to come out of Russia that I think is quite interesting:

* A nationwide Russian survey conducted between February 28 and March 3, when the reality of the war was already apparent. It found that around 58 percent of Russians approved of the invasion of Ukraine, while just 23 percent opposed it. ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/08/russia-public-opinion-ukraine-invasion/))

The poll has carried about by various independent organizations, so it's likely somewhat more reliable than most poll coming out of Russia. 

With this high of a percentage of Russians approving of the invasion, I think it's abundantly clear that the Russian people are being fed lies. And given there's no free press in Russian, it's no surprise that people are believing the fake story line that Putin is telling the,.

If they were actually hearing the truth about the horrors of the war, **do you really think 58% of Russian would give their approval?** I certainly don't think so.. which is what I discussed in last weeks edition of [The Merit](https://themerit.co/?utm_source=JohnRT&amp;utm_medium=JohnRT&amp;utm_campaign=JohnRT&amp;utm_content=JohnRT&amp;utm_term=JohnRT). 

Also, I would add that there is likely a generational diver in what % of Russians are seeing accurate reporting. 

Younger, more computer savvy Russians with access to VPNs are likely to be a bit more in-the-know than Putin's base of middle-aged &amp; older Russians.",72bde61c7443130c84c138a213c0c46534dccbc0,True,False,,,,,0,1648750589,,0,{},i2vn9sm,False,t3_tt5ud4,False,True,t3_tt5ud4,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tt5ud4/what_percentage_of_russians_are_actually_getting/i2vn9sm/,1648750607,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1648721789.0,
