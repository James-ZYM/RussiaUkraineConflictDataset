I've had to show that these are likely the same set of captures 3 times now on combat footage subreddit.

https://twitter.com/Levi_godman/status/1518224966520643585/photo/3 from a Pro Russian Account?  Seem familiar?

1. Look at the three stingers that are claimed in both photos sets.  Weird how it's the same number of captures in both pictures right?  Look closer. See the orange diamond shaped explosive sticker on the right side of the bottom half of the box in both photos?  Weird how it's in the same location on both boxes.  Look even closer on the same box on both pictures, see the damage below the hinges on the bottom half of the box?  The scraping on the green paint that shows white below?  Exact same damage pattern on both boxes in both photos. Same goes for the second box.  See the Orange sticker on the far left of the bottom half of the box?  See how the sticker is damaged on the top corner on both photos? Yeahhh.  Those are the same stingers claimed 4 times now. 

2. Next up, we have the NLAWs.  See how there's only 4+one container in both picture sets?  Weird, huh?  The strap layout matches on at least one as well, but I'd hardly suggest that as anything conclusive.

3. RVveonkor watermarked the photos in both picture sets.

I, in the process of applying for a driver's licence in Australia, found that my foreign passport isn't particularly useful. It can be one of the two required documents, but the government requests a proof that I am ""a member of the community""; that I legitimately live in the area, spend or earn money from community. Things like bank statements, rental agreement, birth certificates of my kids born in the area, etc ... That can be demanded from voters and voters are to be specifically those who lived there prior to 2014.

And mail in ballots. Hey, it worked in America.

&gt;The big problem is that this legitimizes (and encourages) the Russian strategy of 1) invade 2) cleanse 3) call for referendum

&gt;But its twin goals of driving out the Russians by force and bringing down Putin in the process would only be desirable if nuclear weapons could be un-invented. As it is, they offer Russia a court of appeal when facing conventional defeat, in a manner that negates any conventional victory — something that is surely infinitely worse than the outcome of any referendum.

Luttwak is one of the people who are the most confident that 1) nuclear weapons will never ever be used again (""a missile with the aluminum ogive filled with ice cream is more dangerous and can kill more people than when it's fitted with a nuclear warhead and 2) Putin is too rational to invade Ukrainr with 150k troops.

It's interesting to see that he's now breaking out in cold sweat over the possibility of nuclear weapon usage, which will ""opens the gates of Hell"".

Secondly, his highlighting of the apparent Russian violation for what the PLA refer to as the Basic Campaign Principles” (基本战役原则) is disingenuous. For example, Finkelstein says (1) Russia clearly underestimated it's adversary, which he caterogirzes under the alleged “know the enemy and know yourself” (知彼知己)"" principle of the PLA. So, there are 2 points in this context. First, knowing oneself and knowing one's adversary is always going to be an approximation. The first is subject to ego, perception etc. The latter is subject to the fog of war and the inability to really know the capabilities of an adversary. That said, what it may certainly be true that the Russians underestimated their adversary, but we still do not know what exactly the Russians had in mind when they launched their operations. If the east and south east was their actually target then why would they launch operations towards the North and West. Could it be the case that these were ""feint operations"" that went horribly wrong? This will be a matter that Chinese intelligence would be in a position to speak about authoritatively. Finkelstein is just going off public accounts, which is not the basis on which militaries learn ""lessons"". (2) The apparent violation of the PLA campaign principle of “unified coordination” (协调一致). Notice here how Finkelstein's analysis is short on details. He just points to the Russian operations in the northern, eastern and southern parts of Ukraine and leaves it there. This is related to the first point in the sense that we really don't know how the Russians planned this operation, which is a matter that the intelligence agencies will be in a better position to work out. For example, it could be the case that Russians had planned for a high-intensity police operation, which spun out of control (this spinning out of control is not as rare in combat operations as may be expected). The point is that if we have no idea about the nature of the planned operation, we can't be in a position to speculate about whether or not ""unified command"" was intended. Also note that while Finkelstein highlights the PLA principle of ""unified command"", he does not point to the relevant Russian doctrinal concepts at play. One assumes the PLA strategists will not only be comparing how the Russian operations apply to themselves about also how they measure up to the Russian military's own doctrinal concepts. (3) The apparent violation of the PLA principle of “comprehensive support” (全面保障). Finkelstein is imputing - though quite disingenuously not directly saying it - a notion of perfect logistical support for military operations. He is most certainly misguided about this, which is surprising given his background. While there are efficient levels of logistical support that an army can and should expect, it's also subject to the vagaries of war. We have seen this repeatedly happen in numerous wars over the course of history. Indeed, even with appropriate levels of logistical support, operations may fail spectacularly (Vietnam, latter part of Iraq campaign etc). (4) Violation of the ""“take the enemy by surprise” (出敌不意)"" principle. Here Finkelstein is at his worst. ""Surprise"" - as we all know - is a key ingredient in the conduct of war. Equally, we need to remain cognizant of two points - first, we are operating in the 21st Century and as such we operate in the context of what [Stephen Biddle referred to as the ""modern system"" of battle.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s19h). In addition to Biddle's focus on force employment, one also has to factor in the constant strategic and tactical intelligence and surveillance meshes that the modern battlespace is enmeshed within. Thus achieving ""surprise"" - especially tactical surprise - in the modern battlespace is exceedingly difficult and virtually impossible. Even the US with its considerable assets were not able to achieve total tactical surprise in both the Gulf War (consider the fact that both wars were one-sided affairs against a considerably weak adversary and one who had little to no actually support). Moreover as the operations moved from its high-intensity phase into the insurgency, the US intelligence capability was further degraded. Second, and in more specific terms,  in the case of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and without resorting to strategic-political discussions, one cannot avoid noting the fact that without *active* Western support - where ""support"" is not simply political and in terms of weapons but most importantly with intelligence - Ukraine would have been crushed by the Russians. Arguably, even more helpful that the weapons being supplied to the Ukrainians, it's the intelligence that is the key. In this, the Russians are up against some of the most sophisticated intelligence machinery that the world can muster represented by the assets of the Western Alliance.

Some of these considerations lead me to take ""analyses"" like Finkelstein's with more than a pinch of salt.",f746fccd3fc9459eb2bb5bc791a16fad69a6d9a3,True,False,,,,,0,1651533992,,0,{},i73b11s,False,t3_uguz03,False,True,t3_uguz03,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uguz03/beijings_ukrainian_battle_lab/i73b11s/,1651534009,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651505192.0,

[],False,,horsenonamela,,,[],,,,text,t2_33qa9e46,False,False," is your position that through *frequency hopping*, the Ukrainian military will not produce detectable *electromagnetic emissions* while using the communication equipment present at a typical CP? If that’s your position, then I agree with you, there’s no real purpose in us having any sort of conversation about this topic. You basically don’t understand what sort of electromagnetic support collection modern armies are capable of. That’s understandable. Of course, being you, you need to just repeat your incorrect point, call me a Russian shill, then block me. 

Let’s just dispel with your ridiculous theory directly:

&gt; Part of this shift is due to what was a reduced EW threat. The swift defeat of the Iraqi Army, the waning military power of Russia during the 1990s and the rapid toppling of Saddam Hussein
in 2003 made security on the electromagnetic spectrum seem like an afterthought. However,
the belief that SINCGARS could elude modern enemy jammers, as surmised in FM 11-1, is
inaccurate. Even before the full fielding of SINCGARS in 1987, scholars were voicing the
concern that it was still vulnerable to EW capabilities. A 1986 monograph bemoaned that procurement of SINCGARS radios was underway “despite the fact that it is now known that they
are just as vulnerable to the new jammers as are single channel radios.”105 **While SINCGARS
can elude more primitive electronic sensors, today’s computer-assisted jammers and direction
finders can ascertain the pattern of frequency-hopping radios**. With these advances in EW technology, frequency-hopping radios now stand out due to their emission of unique and sporadic
“frequencies at a single location.”106 After determining the hop pattern, “a follower jammer
could be assigned to the frequency associated with that location—thereby jamming every hop”
of that radio.107 Frequency-hopping radios still have an advantage over analog EW equipment, the improvements in EW technology have made them easier (instead of more difficult) to
identify when surrounded by non-military transmissions in single frequency.

…

&gt; Russia has sophisticated
communication EW systems such as the R-330B veryhigh frequency (VHF) jamming and direction-finding
system (seeFigure 7) that can detect and jam frequencyhopping emitters at up to 300 times per second
(enough to keep up with SINCGARS and similar
systems). It can also get a bearing on an emitter direction within three degrees of accuracy, and it has a
detection-to-suppression time of less than five milliseconds.111 In a situation where access to SATCOM
is denied, use of VHF for data and voice traffic will
likely rise, leaving U.S. forces vulnerable to detection
and triangulation with such systems as the R-330B.

&gt;Another notable Russian EW system is the
R-378AM. This system can jam and find the direction
of HF radio systems (see Figure 8), putting long-range
transmitters at risk of being located through single-site
location.112 The Organization for Security Cooperation
in Europe has identified similar EW systems employed
in eastern Ukraine in support of pro-Russian separatists.113 The use of such EW capabilities has caused
considerable communication problems for Ukrainian
forces, who consequently have to sometimes rely on
hard-wired field telephones due to the frequency of
Russian jamming114 that often leaves their cell phones
and radios “unusable for hours at a time.”115 The
Russians pose an undeniable EW threat that the U.S.
Army must address

I suppose I need to find some lower level sources that will directly contradict you again. Sigh.

&gt;Marines need to understand that covered nets do NOT protect them from being located and targeted. Secure nets like SINCGARS VHF FH can be located. The ​volume​ of traffic—especially before stepping off on an operation—is an indicator to the enemy. The ​origin​ of the traffic is a target.

&gt;Marine command posts, a priority target for the enemy, emit large electromagnetic signals. Locate CPs in buildings or woods, and disperse tents, vehicles, antennas, and generators as far away as possible. Cover everything with camouflage netting. CPs are vulnerable to adversary DF collections and must enforce strict EP EMCON procedures.

Simple, low level SOP that describes the modern electromagnetic environment. 

No, “frequency hopping” does not mean that your electronic emissions produced when using a radio disappear. How does that make sense to you from a pure science perspective? I don’t understand why you’re even discussing this if you’re not actually interested in what direction finding capabilities Russia *actually* has. I’m the shill, as you talk about magical Ukrainian communications and untraceable frequency hopping. You have zero clue about the matter that you’re discussing.

https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/05/01/because-of-ukraine-americas-arsenal-of-democracy-is-depleting

&gt; * Can America’s arms industry respond? It must help supply not only Ukraine but also European allies that are rushing to re-arm and America itself, which must replenish its stocks of precision weapons and worry about the risk of renewed great-power conflict. “One of the great success stories of this war is that we have been able to supply the Ukrainians with large numbers of munitions,” says Thomas Mahnken of the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a think-tank in Washington. “My question is: who is going to supply the United States? Nobody.”

&gt; * Most of these weapons have come from stockpiles. Factories may not be able to raise production quickly. Take the Javelin. America does not release details of its stock of weapons. But according to budget documents, its army has bought around 34,500 Javelins since they went into service in 1996. Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, another think-tank, reckons that it has used between 12,500 and 17,500 for training and testing. That would leave 17,000-22,000 in stock at the end of 2021. So the 7,000 Javelins given to Ukraine might account for a third or more of the army’s stock. (His calculation excludes about 2,400 Javelins bought by the marines, and perhaps 5,000 expended in Iraq and Afghanistan.)

&gt; * On May 3rd Mr Biden will visit the factory in Troy, Alabama, where the Javelins are assembled. It produces 2,100 of them a year. It would thus take three or four years to replenish the army—more if orders from other countries take priority. The factory could in theory ramp up to 6,480 Javelins a year. But this assumes that its makers, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, receive firm orders, can find the extra workers and, crucially, components. On earnings calls with investors last month the bosses of both firms spoke of supply-chain constraints.

&gt; * The production of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles is tighter still. They entered service in 1981, and America bought its last batch in 2003. The American production line closed last year, but reopened for a foreign customer (thought to be Taiwan). Its maker, Raytheon, says it has only a limited stock of parts. “Some of the components are no longer commercially available,” Raytheon’s boss, Gregory Hayes, told investors. “And so we’re going to have to go out and redesign some of the electronics in the missile seeker head, and that’s going to take us a little bit of time.”

&gt; * Having long dominated the airspace of war zones, Western countries have underinvested in longer-range ground-to-air weapons of the kind Ukraine is pleading for.

&gt; * This is not the first time they find themselves short of weapons. In the air war in Libya in 2011—a limited campaign—Britain and France quickly ran short of precision-guided munitions (PGMs). America itself, at some points during the campaign against the jihadists of Islamist State in Iraq and Syria in 2014-18, was consuming more PGMs than could be produced.

&gt; * Precision weapons, packed with chips and sensors, are hard and expensive to make. Planners tend to focus on “platforms”—tanks, ships, planes—and save money on the bombs and missiles, notes Bradley Martin of the RAND Corporation, a think-tank supported by the American air force. “A risk is being assumed based on a belief that, if a war were to occur, we would be able to ramp up production,” says Mr Martin. “That’s a bad assumption.”

&gt; * A related problem is a tendency to underestimate how intensely armies use munitions when they are at war. A third is that, after decades of peacetime procurement, industry has given priority to efficiency, not resilience. Maintaining spare capacity is expensive.

&gt; * A recent report by the National Defence Industrial Association, an industry group, argues that America’s defence-industrial base is deteriorating. The biggest problems were a shortage of skilled workers and spare parts. About 30% of firms it questioned said they were the sole supplier of a particular product to the Pentagon.

&gt; * Ms Hicks warns against fixating on particular weapons. “We talk in name-brands. People walk around the street talking about Javelin, but the reality is that we’re providing our anti-tank systems,” she notes. What Ukraine needs is not a particular weapon, but a capability, eg, to stop armoured vehicles. That might be provided by other weapons or allies (Britain and Sweden, say, which have sent their jointly produced Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). And America, she says, is able to draw down stocks of Javelins and Stingers because it has other means with which to destroy tanks and planes.

&gt; * Ideas for improving defence production abound. Bigger stockpiles, diversifying suppliers, modular weapons designs that allow components to be swapped, common standards among allies and joint acquisition. But much of this is hard given that procurement is slow and national industries tend to be protected. Ms Hicks says the Pentagon must give industry “a strong, enduring market signal”, an assurance that if they hire workers and expand factories “the work is going to be there”.

&gt; * For America, the war in Ukraine is still a limited commitment. But if its industry is straining to meet current demand, could it cope with a big war—say against China over Taiwan? “In World War II, one reason industry could rapidly make the shift was because we had a massive amount of unused industrial capacity after the Depression,” says Mr Martin. “Right now the arsenal of democracy is not capable of responding to the demand of long-term high-intensity conflict.”",760d9ec7ba037863693779590dd93edc02125a54,True,False,,,,,0,1651532697,,0,{},i7386zl,False,t3_ugrjje,False,True,t3_ugrjje,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugrjje/flexibility_in_the_us_defense_industrial_base_and/i7386zl/,1651532710,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651503897.0,

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces did not conduct any confirmed ground attacks along any axes of advance and instead shelled Ukrainian positions on the frontlines.  
The April 30 Ukrainian artillery strike on Russian command headquarters near Izyum likely disrupted Russian operations on the Izyum axis and may hinder Russian offensives from Izyum for the next few days.  
Russian forces on the Southern Axis continued to regroup and reconnoiter likely in preparation for ground assaults in the direction of Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian attacks from Izyum will likely be at least temporarily disrupted by the attack on Russian command post in the area.  
Russian forces will likely attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol.  
Russian forces may be preparing to conduct renewed offensive operations to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in the coming days.",87b714c8f5bb4e1a7cd06ab8a6e2b1d3bfd3d11b,True,False,,,,,0,1651530743,,0,{},i733w8b,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t3_ugo0q5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i733w8b/,1651530757,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651501943.0,

I am focussing on the line that goes from Belgorad to Kupyansk, which is the line at the top left in that ISW map. 

The other lines go to Voronehz, which is about 3 times the distance, and one of those lines joins the Belgorod line before it goes through the 40km excalibur circle and so can also be cut from the Staryi Saltiv position in any case.

&gt;As would any longer range PGM both sides possess. How come they didn't do it? Too dumb to figure it out, I guess they need to conscript and battlefield promote more Redditors to colonel

Haven't the russians been doing exactly this ? Attacking rail infrastructure with PGMs to cut rail lines ? They've been doing this for weeks. So they at least figured it out without a reddit colonel.

Have they been wasting their PGMs all this time because I'm wrong ? Or because there are other rail lines that can take supplies to the Donbas and they wern't cutting all of them ?

On the UA side.... I don't think they have PGMs that can do this. 

The Tochka's are too expensive and inaccurate. And I don't think the TB2 munitions would neccessarily cut the line, they're tiny. 

I can't find info on the warhead weight, but I'd estmate 20% or less of a 155mm round on the biggest one, and 5% or less on the little one.... and the TB2 itself is a bit expensive to lose doing this, given you'd have to repeatedly use it to cut the line multiple times a day and it'd get shot down doing so.

But absolutely Russia has been using their PGMs to do this.... they haven't regarded that as a waste, even though they're way more expensive than Excalibur rounds.

&gt;They can't keep drones on it 24/7 and if they can't see it they didn't interdict it with blind fire.

They don't need to. They need to get a drone on it (or spec ops sighting on it) often enough to keep cutting it. 

A few drone missions a day isn't 24/7.... and a 2-man spec ops team or two in well concealed positions will do fine.

&gt;Long range recon can't sit out indefinitely in enemy territory overwatching a rail station, especially when there are a limited number of SOF units trained for that mission and lots of missions

Thats pretty much what spec ops teams are supposed to do. SAS 2 man teams sat out in fields in NI for weeks surveiling suspicious farms on the border from hides.

2 guys sitting in a well concealed position spotting guided munitions strikes is SF bread and butter.

&gt;You can't draw that conclusion because you don't even know where the rail lines that supply Izyum run through. Its not Vovchans'k

2 of those 3 lines run through the circle I drew. And in my initial comment I noted there was a line that couldn't be reached, but that it was unclear how much of the supplies came this way as it didn't have the close anchor on the russian side of the border Belgorod is for the vovchansk line.

The other line doesn't hit a major rail terminus for over 300km.

&gt;Bingo. And it's that easy to fix a rail line too, which is why arty isn't used to cut supply lines, only harass and interdict them.

Yes, which is why you'd need to keep cutting the line..... which is why you couldn't do it with a TB2 (without being prepared to lose several of them)..... but you can do it with artillery shells if they are in range, because you can re-cut the line with another shell relatively cheaply and with no risk to highly expensive and rare assets.

Excalibur shells are $64k a pop. TB2s are, what ? $2m ? +$25k for the MAM-L munition.

You can cut the line 30 times.... for the cost of losing a TB2 trying to cut it once (or perhaps successfully cutting it 3 times, and losing the TB2 on attempt 4).

&gt;Which is ""fill hole, lay track"" its quicker than repairing a cratered four lane hardball road.

Yes, itd take only a few hours to re-fill and re-lay track. So quick you could do it maybe 3 or 4 or 5 times a day.

Which isn't any good in enabling the supply of your forces if the line is cut 3 or 4 or 5 times a day.

Because *the trains can't keep moving, albeit slower, while its being filled in* like they can with a road. They have to stop. 

You can't cut a rail line 3-4-5 times a day with Tochka's or TB2s.... they're expensive and rare.

You can with something like Excaliburs. You get 30 of them to 1 TB2.... and 5 of them to a Tochka (and you might need multiple tochkas to get a cut given how inaccurate they are).

The benefit of being in artillery range is the process of cutting the line is repeatable at low cost.

&gt;Which is ""fill hole, lay track"" its quicker than repairing a cratered four lane hardball road.

Not the Belgorod&gt;Kupyansk line. Nor the 50% of the vovchansk lines either.

Its unclear how quickly they could pivot to supplying all 22 BTGs from Voronehz.... which in any case is 3 times the distance from kupiyansk belgorod is.

But, again, if its pointless to spend $68k cutting a rail line if there are alternative routes..... why has russia expended $millions in irreplacable cruise missiles trying to do just that, even if there are alternative routes ?

Someone ought to tell them they're wasting their time, because there is another line ""over there"" that can do the job. So they'd be best off lobbing their million dollar cruise missiles at something that isn't rail logistics.",eae440704dd03ac352de9df9a2096013eae06271,True,False,,,,,0,1651530355,,0,{},i7331gl,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i72xkuo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i7331gl/,1651530369,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651501555.0,

You keep mentioning Vovchans'k but the Izyum supply lines don't run through it.  [ISW Map showing the supply lines PLEASE ACTUALLY READ IT THIS TIME](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20April%2030%2C2022.png)

You're focusing on the wrong rail line.

&gt;You can cut a rail line with shelling.... a single excaliber guided round would probably do it. 

As would any longer range PGM both sides possess. How come they didn't do it? Too dumb to figure it out, I guess they need to conscript and battlefield promote more Redditors to colonel

&gt;I think UA are capable of getting a drone above it TBH. But even if they aren't, they're certainly capable of getting SF spotters on it, they're operating in an environment with local support, only 25km from their front lines and at a spot visible from at least two towns/villages (in the 25km circle) and a 50km of line spottable from a thousand places (in the 40km range of guided excalibur rounds). They can spot that rail line.

They can't keep drones on it 24/7 and if they can't see it they didn't interdict it with blind fire.

Long range recon can't sit out indefinitely in enemy territory overwatching a rail station, especially when there are a limited number of SOF units trained for that mission and lots of missions

&gt;The russians can no longer rely on that rail line being open to supply their concentration of troops south of Izyium. It can be cut at any time, and re-cut whenever it is repaired.

You can't draw that conclusion because you don't even know where the rail lines that supply Izyum run through. [Its not Vovchans'k](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kharkiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20April%2030%2C2022.png)

&gt;and would only cut it until they'd filled one with rubble

Bingo. And it's that easy to fix a rail line too, which is why arty isn't used to cut supply lines, only harass and interdict them. 

&gt;Not a railway line where if the ""1 metre wide track"" is severed all traffic must stop until new track is placed.

Which is ""fill hole, lay track"" its quicker than repairing a cratered four lane hardball road.

&gt;Russian can't rely on that rail line now.

Sure they can.

If we were to assume the US was fighting a similar sized war to Ukraine, with a similar number of Russian forces, the methods to destroy those Russian tanks would be very different. Ukraine is fighting very well but they are fighting with a lot of light infantry and unguided artillery against a mechanized force. If the US were in this conflict, how many of those Russian AFVs would have been taken out by Mavericks, Hellfires, TOWs, MLRS strikes, Abrams shots, Excaliburs, etc. In a war with the US, I think it is clear that either Javelin use would be lower or Russian losses would be higher due to the other systems in play. Either way, the existing Javelin stockpile looks like it’s sufficient. 

Obviously Ukraine has other anti-armor weapons besides Javelins but it is the best and one of the most numerous they have available. Their heavy use of light infantry means that infantry ATGMs are being used up very quickly. That would not be the case with the United States. Ukraine is, in my opinion, fighting a much more Javelin intensive conflict than the US would fight and yet they have inflicted massive casualties with 1/3 of our available inventory. I think that shows that we certainly have enough. 

That isn’t to say the US has stockpiled enough of every type of weapon. I am sure there are stocks which are quite inadequate right now, as is commonly shown in war games. I do believe any war that is likely to be fought in the near future is a come as you are fight. The idea of cranking out thousands of new tanks or missiles or planes or ships to turn the tide just seems unlikely to me with current production times. If my supposition is right, that necessitates a different type of look at the DIB. One that focuses on enough stocks going into a conflict instead of the ability to crank out more.

The Southern Military District OSK is running the war now, their CAA HQs to the north, northeast, east and southeast of the Donbas area (2nd, 20th and 41st CAA, and 1st GTA,).

Also, for someone who self-selected themselves to be a despotic leader by virtue of exceptional ambition, self-obsession, and belief in their predestination by providence there is a real chance they prefer to 'flip the table' and punish everyone rather than lose power.

In the final months of WW2, Hitler said the German people and military having failed him and that they deserved to die alongside his regime. He officially ordered the destruction of ""anything of value within Reich territory, which could in any way be used by the enemy"" essentially out of spite because by that point the war was understood to be lost. Goebbles and his wife killed themselves and their 6 kids so they wouldn't have to live in a world without National Socialism.  When Americans reached Dachau, the SS ordered the prisoners to be burned to death, certainly not something that would improve Germany's perception. People were getting hung on streetlamps for giving up/deserting even after Hitler had killed himself.

Type 1: Direct airstrikes. Usually clear military value close to the front. Almost exclusively in Belogrod and Kursk regions. Normally done via helicopter, drone, or cruise Missle. Think the recent explosion in Belogrod.

Type 2: Direct Sabotage by Ukraine or it's allies. Again, mostly near the front, military value targets. But, there is more wiggle room then Type1. For instance, it's possible the fire at the Russian Missle Lab falls into Type 2. The recent Kursk railway explosion was probably Type 2.

Type 3: Sabotage by non-affiliated anti-war Ukranians, Belarusians, and Russians. Mostly civilians, though there might be some kind of organizational infastructure. Pretty far reaching inside Russia. Mostly smaller targets, and far more likely to be symbolic then practical, though some might be of military value. Think the fires at Russian Recruitment offices or Belarusian railway sabotage.

Type 4: War-Causrd Genuine Accidents. In even the best run countries a military campaign increases accidents. Russia is not a ""best run country"". Lax safety and training standards with hazardous material and poor maitance of old gear are causing some. Others are poorly run industries being forced to expand production well outside their capacity. On some level, what we're seeing is the entire Russian *System* failing to cope with the strain of actual pressing nessecity. Most common in industrial spaces and military facilities that are not in Kursk/Belogrod. Good examples of this might include some of the noteable Russian factory fires.

Type 5: Normal Accidents. When we're already looking closely for fires and explosions in Russia, were going to find a lot. Lots of folks have noted that actually Russia has had bad industrial accident and fire safety problems for years. But, because all our eyes are on Russia we're suddenly seeing them and adding to the trend. These accidents are dispositionally at places not on the front with zero or low military utility (though some might be in actually useful places). This doesn't mean there's no relationship to the war. Types 1-4 and the war itself is eating much of Russia's manpower and expertise for fighting fires and explosions, making routine or normal fires more difficult to control. Good examples might be that recent mall fire or the wildfires in Siberia.

[],False,,faguzzi,,,[],,,,text,t2_z0ms5,False,False,"&gt; And how do you identify them? Soothsaying?

I don’t understand? Are you saying that you don’t know what direction finding ew platforms do?

I’d imagine they would use one of their EW platforms with that capability such as the R-934UM (for HF/VHF detection and direction finding) or the R-330Zh Zhitel (for UHF). [1](https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2018/ICDS_Report_Russias_Electronic_Warfare_to_2025.pdf) At the theater level I’d imagine they’d use their Murmansk BNs. (I strongly recommend everyone read section 3.1.4-3.1.5 for what happened in this area during the earlier conflict and how Ukraine has been adapting, because again, there is no open source information about this topic for the current conflict)

&gt; In terms of SIGINT, Ukrainian command posts are using encrypted comms the Russians can't break into or jam and freq hopping they can't triangulate. As far as capabilities are concerned, when they can use technology so advanced the enemy can't deal with it that is effectively magic.

This is not a good or accurate summary of this issue. To say that Russia is incapable of detecting the EM signatures that typical equipment inside a command post has because the Ukrainians are using “freq hopping they can’t triangulate” is outright incorrect.

&gt; If they tried they've obviously had almost no success. 

I respond to this because it encompasses your entire point about non EM means of detecting command posts. There is no reliable open source information about Ukrainian losses, especially losses of this kind. You have no clue how badly Ukrainian CPs are getting hit or by what means Russia detected them in what limited vignettes we do have.

&gt; The US created the UAF commo system, are providing them their intel, and are assisting them in tactical, operational, and strategic planning, to include giving them all the assets needed to target Russian C4I from beginning to end. But okay sure, it's all a big fucking coincidence and not really at all comparable because the Ukrainians lack something critical. Not intel to find them, not comms to report what they found, not PGMs to target them, they have all those things. No, something else... What is that something?

Oh you know, just the vast electromagnetic spectrum superiority of the US. No big deal, honestly. Let’s see: [VROD, VMAX](https://www.army.mil/article/226082/army_showcases_new_electronic_warfare_tech], and [Raven Claw](https://www.army.mil/article/199368/raven_claw_augments_battle_management_for_electronic_warfare_operations). Or you know, the hundreds of sensors america has that need to be placed within the battle space to be effective. Having access to American satellite data and AWACS out of Poland does not make you America. If you’re actually going to sit here and say with a straight face that america and Ukraine are equally capable of detecting and locating the EM signature of a Russian command post, you have zero idea what you’re talking about. I’m very confused, you seem to just not understand the concept of detecting EM and using that the target C2 and that this is something all major militaries can do now.

Here are some open source qualitative comments about the nature of this issue for anyone interested:

&gt;Today’s enemies do not always need drones, human scouts or satellites to exploit a unit’s vulnerabilities. Instead, passive observance of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) allows the identification and tracking of our systems and equipment, similar to a unit’s physical presence on terrain except at much greater distances. In the opening scenario, a brigade combat team’s cavalry squadron created first contact not through visual or audible means, but miles closer to the friendly CP due to the propagation of waves coming from communication platforms.
Everything a unit brings into an area emits some form of signal. The more communications, computers and systems a unit adds, its signature increases. More importantly, just a collection of multiple systems at low power levels allows an enemy scout to identify the difference between a troop-level CP running two radio nets vs. a squadron or brigade running four or more radio nets. This can all be done without committing physical forces in range of direct-fire weapons. [2](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Dooley21.pdf)

&gt; Experience in the current operational environment shows enemy forces
couple EW assets with artillery to ruthlessly target our C2 nodes. In LSCO,
units can expect the same high-threat environment for CPs at all echelons.
To survive and operate, BNs must begin by having a general understanding
of each C2 node’s and system’s electromagnetic (EM) signature. A fully
established BN MCP, with multiple generators, amplified SINCGARS
nets, satellite communications, and the range of WIN–T equipment has an
enormous EM signature. An MCP intentionally established with purely
analog capability may be less effective, but significantly more survivable.
BNs must balance survivability and effective C2 by choosing when, where,
and how often to operate the systems in their C2 nodes. Depending on
the tactical situation, simply establishing a C2 node full time may not be
viable. To ensure C2 node survival, commanders and staffs must be ready to
execute operations with degraded capabilities and breaks in communication.

No, a fair bit closer. A map with a 25km radius on it. The railway line runs alongside the highway going south-east from Vovchansk

https://imgur.com/KYBAGgI

If they've taken Staryi Saltiv, and expecially if they've taken the countryside a little north of it, then they're within range of that railine as it comes out of Vovchansk with standard rounds.

&gt;Second, if advancing to get inside artillery range was all that was needed to cut supply lines then every war in modern history would have been different.

But we're talking a rail line here. Not a road where you can drive around the shell craters or ""go up on the side bank"".

You can cut a rail line with shelling.... a single excaliber guided round would probably do it. 

When they repair it, you can cut it again. If you have to expend 5 excaliburs a day to keep cutting it multiple times a day, you're cutting off the supply of 1/4 of the russian army for a cost of $350k per day.

The russians can no longer rely on that rail line being open to supply their concentration of troops south of Izyium. It can be cut at any time, and re-cut whenever it is repaired.

This is a worthwhile exercise for UA with fully 1/4 of the whole russian army being supplied down it.

&gt;Yes, they can harass it but get can't cut it, especially when they don't have 24/7 surveillance of the target so they can actually call in accurate fires. Otherwise they're doing blind H&amp;I fires, which are far more harassment than interdiction.

I think UA are capable of getting a drone above it TBH. But even if they aren't, they're certainly capable of getting SF spotters on it, they're operating in an environment with local support, only 25km from their front lines and at a spot visible from at least two towns/villages (in the 25km circle) and a 50km of line spottable from a thousand places (in the 40km range of guided excalibur rounds). They can spot that rail line.

&gt;Think of it this way. When the Russians got within miles of M06 leading west to Lyiv, why couldn't they cut it despite being in artillery range?

Because its a 4 lane motorway, with 2 hard shoulders and a median that appears to be about 20 meters wide .... and so you can drive around shell craters on it ? You'd need to get 10 craters ""all in a row"" to cut it, and would only cut it until they'd filled one with rubble. 

Not a railway line where if the ""1 metre wide track"" is severed all traffic must stop until new track is placed.

&gt;The Russians are well within artillery range of the entire UAF supply line in the Severodonetsk salient, but can't cut it.

I am not sure they haven't cut it TBH. But, again, I am pretty sure again thats a bunch of roads, not rail lines.

It is significantly harder to cut a road than a rail line, yes. Cars can drive around obstacles in a way trains can't. A single crater slap bang in the middle of a road doesn't sever the road, and only slows traffic until they can ""throw a bunch of rubble in"" to fill it.

&gt;And now the UAF are currently well within artillery range (only a few miles) of the Russian north-south supply line to Izyum but can't cut that were arty either.

That is also..... a road.

The forces south of Izyium are being supplied by rail Belgorod &gt; Kupyansk.... with the russian logistics road fleet only handling the 100km from Kupyiansk south to their front lines. 

Here is that map again with the 40km excalibur range as the circle.

https://imgur.com/a/xNEqkkP

There is a 50km stretch of the rail line Russia is currently using to move supplies from Belgorod to Kupyiansk that they can now cut from positions around Staryi Saltiv.

If they do it at the right time they might be able to get a derailment on top of a severing of that line too, which'd be even more of a mess to clear up and would put a whole ammo dump worth of materials out of action.

In addition I am sure there are many small culverts and bridges all up and down that 50km stretch they could cut, delaying repairs from ""a few hours"" to ""a day"" if they spotted and hit that bit.

&gt; Rather, the United States needs to work with its close allies to both increase their collective munitions stockpiles and production capacity while also adopting innovative approaches to munitions production.

I think this actually demonstrates the exact opposite. Assuming Ukraine has used 1/2 of the Javelins we have sent and that Russia has deployed between 65% and 75% of their entire armed forces in Ukraine, this demonstrates that Ukraine has stalled the vast majority of their army with between 1/6th and 1/3rd of our stock of Anti-tank weapons. 

It would seem to me that the pre-war stockpiles in the US were adequate. Sure we should work to replace them, but they are currently going against the #1 adversary they were made to destroy. 

More or less, every Javelin used to destroy a Russian tank/APC is one less Javelin needed in storage anyways.

If nothing else, having one T14 is not a substitute for 1,000 T80s.

So I guess continued modernization and increase number of advance platforms. 

&gt;One lesson they may draw is that even for militaries with extensive experience, war remains a difficult business.

America utilized over 900k men for Operation Desert Storm, I always thought Russia's 200k men is ridiculous. I didn't think they would be so terrible, but it's almost comical what some people are saying. Even America needed 750k American troops for a real war, but Russia with less advantages needs less? 

&gt;One suspects the nuclear issue will be looked at long and hard by Beijing’s military and civilian strategists.

Doesn't sound fun. China isn't building 10 carriers, so that it can challenge America on nuclear weapons. 

China has a real shot at conventional advantage, why would nuclear rank that high on its list. It's something to do, sure, but at the end of the day, match the US ship for ship, jet for jet is key.

And how do you identify them? Soothsaying? 

In terms of SIGINT, Ukrainian command posts are using encrypted comms the Russians can't break into or jam and freq hopping they can't triangulate. As far as capabilities are concerned, when they can use technology so advanced the enemy can't deal with it that is effectively magic.

Ukraine rear lines are far more secure than Russian as they have a loyal population helping them, so HUMINT is mostly out. Are Russian Alpha teams doing deep recon behind Ukraine lines looking to find HQs? If they tried they've obviously had almost no success. Accidental open source releases have cost Ukraine some targets that the Russians have hit but obviously they havent found many Ukraine field HQs who have better OPSEC.

Has aerial recon or satellites found any? Again, since almost none are reported to have been hit, they can't rely on the capabilities either.

&gt;And no, there is a vast difference between the capability of America and Ukraine to target enemy c2 nodes. That’s not a credible comparison.

First, the Russian supply lines for Izyum are as far from Staryi Saltiv as Staryi Saltiv is from Kharkiv. 

Second, if advancing to get inside artillery range was all that was needed to cut supply lines then every war in modern history would have been different. Yes, they can harass it but get can't cut it, especially when they don't have 24/7 surveillance of the target so they can actually call in accurate fires. Otherwise they're doing blind H&amp;I fires, which are far more harassment than interdiction. 

Think of it this way. When the Russians got within miles of M06 leading west to Lyiv, why couldn't they cut it despite being in artillery range? The Russians are well within artillery range of the entire UAF supply line in the Severodonetsk salient, but can't cut it. On the flip side, in the Kyiv front numerous Ukraine units were within artillery range of the Russian supply line (which was far more vulnerable than the one supplying Izyum), but couldn't cut it with arty. And now the UAF are currently well within artillery range (only a few miles) of the Russian north-south supply line to Izyum but can't cut that were arty either.

This is because maneuver warfare is way more complicated than moving artillery forward so range fans overlap targets, that helps but isn't decisive at all. If the Ukrainians really want to cut the Russian supply line for Izyum, they're only halfway there. However, they are close enough that they are threatening them, especially if there isn't a substantial force arrayed in depth to stop them, let alone retake some ground, which means Russian need to peel off more units to deal with them and THAT is why the UAF attack was conducted: it was a very well executed operation done as a spoiling attack. Flaechen und Luekentaktik, Surfaces and Gaps, a very old school German concept for maneuver warfare that the US bought into heavily in the 70s and obviously taught the Ukrainians. Instead of using reserves to counterattack Russian strong points (surfaces) in the Severodonetsk salient they're attacking where they're weaker (gaps), but still forcing the Russians to lose combat power in the Severodonetsk salient, which is the main effort for both sides.

Then there was likely political pressure to continue the assault as fast as possible without taking the necessary time to regroup, driving them further into disorganization.

&gt; * In Russia, maternal grief has been a particularly powerful, iconic force, tracing back to World War II, in reverence for the sacrifice of millions upon millions of sons killed while halting the Nazi invasion.

&gt; * But in the 1980s, Soviet veneration of the mothers started to backfire during the occupation of Afghanistan. A host of angry women rose up to protest the widespread abuse of new recruits within deployed units – to the chagrin of the military and politburo.

&gt; * Russian soldiers’ mothers found a greater voice in the next decade. Fierce women mobilized against the Russian war with the breakaway republic of Chechnya. In early 1995, they demonstrated in Red Square; a few days later they headed to a devastated Grozny, ground zero of the hostilities. In the weeks that followed, they confronted Russian military commanders to gain the release of dozens of their boys and men.

&gt; * ...through social media platforms like Telegram (heavily used by Zelenskyy), Russian families can seek and find the truth about the fate of their sons. Imagine a legion of inconsolable mothers descending on the Kremlin. Imagine their collective voices raised in righteous grief that their boys have become cannon fodder.",7720b54248d03fe97b72055012b4352aada54b14,True,False,,,,,0,1651518439,,0,{},i72agfn,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t3_ugo0q5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i72agfn/,1651518451,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651489639.0,

The reason for saying that is the only area I can see they have any advantage at the moment is in artillery.

So far as tanks go, Ukraine is probably getting to the point of matching them there, and also has more in the way of effective anti-tank capability.

Ukraine now has more soldiers due to its internal draft compared to what Russia has on the field.

Air superiority for Russia is debatable given that Ukraine still has a functional airforce. The Ukrainians also make much more effective use of drones. Plus their air defence is taking down a lot of Russian aircraft.

Russia is also likely running low on cruise and guided missiles. Plus due to the sanctions, it is finding it difficult to replace equipment it is using or losing.

So, it seems to me that once the Ukrainians get the large amount of western-supplied artillery into the game, they are going to be far too strong for the Russians. Especially since they are already holding the Russians back, and counter-attacking around Kharkiv and Kherson with the stuff they are using now.

I think the Ukrainians have huge advantages in strategy, intelligence, and tactical nous.

[],False,,Draskla,,,[],,,,text,t2_hw71hsw6,False,False,"&gt; Lots of people in western countries seem to have no fear of nuclear war. They don't seek to minimize its risk because I don't think they have any real appreciation for what it would entail. This of course comes on the heels of 30 years of unquestioned US hegemony and lopsided conflicts with adversaries that could never out-escalate it.

&gt; Since modern Russia's conventional military has been revealed as a paper tiger, lots of people in the west are beginning to exhibit a lack of restraint in dealing with a nuclear adversary. The rhetoric we're hearing from American politicians now would have been unimaginable in the late Cold War.

These points are abject and utter nonsense. First, there is immense and even absolute fear in the ""people"" of the West of a nuclear catastrophe. When Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the sale of Iodine pills skyrocketed literally the following morning across all of Western Europe. But it wasn't just the people; governments are worried too. Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S. have all been independently, as well as on a NATO level, designing containment and counter-response strategies for a tactical nuclear deployment from Russia. Shit, Denmark increased its Iodine stockpile. 

There are news stories from Western media on the likelihood of said nuclear war fallout literally on a daily basis and has been since the war began in February. More anecdotally, I live in one of the largest cities in the world which has also been a site of previous attacks by adversarial actors, and I can say with a large degree of certainty that there is a marked increase in not just the dialogue around a nuclear fallout, but real anxiety around the topic. So, this idea that the West is complacent regarding nuclear war is just not true. Now, is there widespread *panic* around the issue? No. Partly because it has been two months of non-stop war and attentions fray, partly because there's literally not much something the Western military can do or say to stop Putin if he's bent on being irrational, and partly because as COVID showed, there are unreasonable people that are prone to the belief that everything is being done to scare them into being compliant (the conspiracy theorists.)

Secondly, to your point of escalatory actions and rhetoric from politicians and governments: proxy wars have been fought from the beginning of mankind. But, more recently, Korea and Vietnam were two theaters of war where the Soviets and Chinese went **far** beyond the support the West has provided Ukraine thus far. Mind you, these were two post-atomic bomb wars that the U.S. fought and suffered from relatively high levels of attrition. If you want to get even more recent, there was considerable chatter around Russia putting bounty on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The proxy war being fought in Syria is even more relevant. Not once has the U.S. or any Western nation involved in any post WW2 proxy war even whispered the N word. 

Regarding rhetoric, I believe you're just ignorant to history. There has been strong rhetoric, especially in the lower house of representatives (the Duma in Russia and the House in the U.S.), around this topic for over 70 years. Ask any historian of how charged the political and military environment was around McCarthyism. Yet, President's never stepped down to that level. For example, even at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy never explicitly threatened first use of nuclear weapons. But were there numerous war hawk politicians, especially those in marginal seats, that were championing a stronger response? Yes. Were there exponentially higher levels of bluster during parts of Cold War than there has been during the Ukraine conflict? Undeniably so. 

Lastly, reminder that Russia's sovereign territory is not under threat here. Ukraine isn't claiming any part of Russia as its own.",0604f3c0bb73736ff4eb07ec3c3a032c102a9fb0,True,False,,,,,0,1651516101,,0,{},i724njj,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i71tc3c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i724njj/,1651516116,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651487301.0,

This is a risk invaders have to take and Russian doctrine is especially forward facing for even high ranking officers for what I imagine is cultural and historical reasons, which gives the UA quite the advantage. 

Meanwhile top UA leadership is, seemingly, safely behind the front lines and follows a more western approach of having top commanders not near the front and communicating over protected comms. Also, the UA is clearly getting quite a bit of NATO intelligence, but they are probably also benefiting from NATO counter-intelligence, which must be tripping up the Russians in this regard. Maybe Russia has been hitting decoy sites, maybe the decoy signal to noise ratio is too high for them to get real targets.

Part of the defenders advantage is that Russia more or less lives on the front and the front is where you can sneak in a drone or an artillery strike. 

Lastly, say you're a Russian general and have a leadership target in the west 400+ miles away, what are your options?  Fighter jets will get shot down before they get close due to the UAF and AA.

Take this with a grain of salt as it is the experience of two elderly Ukrainians who both speak Russian. Their experience was that it was extraordinarily slow, bureaucratic, and less like a ""checkpoint"" and more like an actual *camp.* Extremely disorganized, with some people being ""temporarily"" detained there for a week or more while others were able to pass through relatively quickly. Lots of documents being issued and then taken and issued again (in my opinion to give the illusion of legitimacy / an official aesthetic). 

It was much more difficult getting through customs to enter Russia proper which was apparently a very long and intense process with a *lot* of questioning (as if a 70 year old refugee is somehow a huge security risk). 

I don't have much more information than this. They also said the Russians treated them surprisingly well, gave them food and helped them to the train and such - but like I said, my relatives are elderly and speak Russian so this helps a lot. Another interesting anecdote was that many of the young men in Mariupol were extremely cynical about the Zelensky government in the opening of the war and there is a *lot* of resentment that their city was ""sacrificed."" Genuinely speaking, they feel very let down by their country and are very angry that Zelensky kept telling them ""don't worry there won't be a war"" (this is why they chose to stay and they paid a heavy price for it).",351e9431550183746c249b887dca092730bdf554,True,False,,,,,0,1651514346,,0,{},i7208ty,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i71yslr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i7208ty/,1651514358,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651485546.0,

The B57 bomb for example, which weighed 500 pounds, could be configured for yields between 5-20 kilotons.  The Hiroshima bomb in comparison was 15 kilotons. 

Assuming the target is a Ukrainian battalion occupying a frontage of  3-5 kilometers, one B57 of could destroy all its personnel and vehicles, including dug in infantry and tank crews.  Trenches and armor would not protect against that level of yield.

Of course, I'm not privy to Ukrainian tactical unit frontages, but 3-5 kilometers seems a good guess based on what I've seen used in other conflicts.  If that is accurate, and assuming a Ukrainian brigade has 3-5 battalions, then perhaps an equal number of tac nukes would suffice to eliminate it.

David M. Finkelstein is a retired U.S. Army officer and long-time student of Asian security affairs. He is the director for China &amp; Indo-Pacific Security Affairs at CNA, an independent research institute in Arlington, Virginia. The views expressed are strictly his own.

----------------

&gt; * In 2016, the PLA underwent the most sweeping reorganization in its history in an attempt to better position itself to be able to fight modern information-age warfare.

&gt; * The PLA’s professional military journals often contain articles discussing the latest developments in Russian military affairs, as well as those taking place in the U.S. joint force. 

&gt; * …assessing Russian operational performance will be a high-priority task for PLA analysts as they move closer to their Russian counterparts.

&gt; * Russia’s performance in Ukraine will provide the PLA with a sense of the difference between training and actual combat.

&gt; * This issue is of great importance for the PLA, which is all too aware of the fact that it has not seen large-scale combat since it invaded Vietnam in 1979. 

&gt; * One lesson they may draw is that even for militaries with extensive experience, war remains a difficult business.

&gt; * Although Beijing has a significant indigenous defense manufacturing sector, the PLA still has in its inventory Russian-manufactured or Russian-inspired weapons, systems, and platforms.

&gt; * …it is too early to state with high confidence what military professionals in China think they are learning from Russia’s operations.

&gt; * At the operational level, PLA analysts will notice that Russian operations to date seem to be violating some of the PLA’s time-honored “Basic Campaign Principles” (基本战役原则).

&gt; * As long-time students of Russian doctrine, the PLA will likely be wondering, if not incredulous, about the apparent lack of “jointness” in Russian operations. 

&gt; * In November 2020, after 20 years of experimentation, the PLA totally revamped its doctrine for joint operations. The new PLA paradigm for joint operations, known as “Integrated Joint Operations” (一体化联合作战), calls for unity of effort and integration among the services across land, sea, air, and key high-tech battlespace domains such as cyberspace, outer space, and the electromagnetic spectrum — all under a unified command and control structure. 

&gt; * These Russian operations do not exemplify the “operational art” that the PLA hopes to be able to implement.

&gt; * …the PLA is the “armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party,” it is a political force as well as a military force. The PLA has a corps of political officers to enforce discipline, strengthen the link between the military and the party, attend to civil-military dynamics, and deal with the personnel aspects of warfare. 

&gt; * One can imagine that PLA analysts and others in the Chinese national security community will study the role that Russia’s possession of a serious nuclear deterrent is playing in shaping the choices of the United States and NATO in their responses to Moscow’s operations, including the early decision not to intervene militarily. 

&gt; * One suspects the nuclear issue will be looked at long and hard by Beijing’s military and civilian strategists.

&gt; * Officials in Beijing continue to state that this conflict is not something they wished to see. We should take that statement at face value.",6e31d7d2f5d62ae93a45a0b3b191595ce2d188df,True,False,,,,,0,1651512833,,0,{},i71wfuv,True,t3_uguz03,False,True,t3_uguz03,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uguz03/beijings_ukrainian_battle_lab/i71wfuv/,1651512850,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651484033.0,

How can Russia find any UAF field HQs to hit them? How do they know when certain field commanders are present to know that's when you hit that specific location already identified?

Also likely the UAF are practicing communication discipline far better than their Russian counterparts.

Now flip it around. UAF has access to the greatest SIGINT capabilities in the world, courtesy of the US and other NATO countries. Russians are known for having poor comms discipline, and are even still using unencrypted communications. Not just radios but likely cell phones too, it's all being intercepted. Ukraine has stay behind forces, especially SOF, operating behind Russian lines looking for these locations, probably overwatching them 24/7 from recce hide sites where they very well might be watching live when certain commanders and their enormous entourage show up, at which point they can radio it in fully securely and have PGMs on target quickly.

1. Lack of capability (poor intelligence, bad targeting, good OPSEC by Ukrainians) 
2. Deliberate avoidance by Russia (for... what reason? This one seems least likely to me)
3. Ukrainian C2 is far more distributed and mobile than the Russians, hence much harder to target
4. Russia has been able to kill some Ukrainian generals, but no verification / heavy censorship by the Ukrainian government.

Russia lost at least 10 BTGs worth of equipment last week.

""Russia has had the most progress near Zaporizhzhia but Ukraine has now been able to stop that as well. Russian advances near Izyum, Severodonetsk and Slovyansk have been extremely minimal and have come with heavy losses.""

Ukraine's success north of Kharkiv means Russian shelling can only come from the east and Ukraine now has the Belgorod-Izyum highway in artillery range.

I'd question the assumption here (it drives *russian* oil and gas prices up which benefits Russia as they sell to other parties).

First off, in the case of Gas.... Russia can't export that anywhere else. It takes pipelines to move gas (or at least russian doesn't have the facilities to turn it into LNG which can be tankered elsewhere) and almost all of russia's gas pipelines run to the west.

As I understand it, their one pipeline to China is already at max capacity and it will be years before there is another... so I don't think there is an open market for their gas they can sell it to other than the EU. That makes any cutoff ""a dead loss"" to Russia, no matter what the price level reaches. If the Eu refuses to buy it, they can't sell it (and also, I understand, cutting it off at source which they'd have to do might even damage their fields). 

With oil, the situation is more complicated..... Russia really can send tankers elsewhere and sell that oil to other markets.... but here I'd question the assumption that the price of russian oil has gone up.

The prices for WTI (american oil), Brent (EU oil) and Arab Oil (Guess where?) have gone up substantially.... but Urals oil (Russia) has gone down in price.

Spot price for Urals was $94.41 on 24/2/22.... Today its $78.15 (after hitting a low around $71 last week). The war has sent oil prices up in general, but *the price for russian oil* way down.

Urals used to trade at $1-2 discount from brent crude. Today it trades at a $35.45 discount from brent crude.

In addition, they don't seem to be selling an awful lot of it even at that shockingly discounted price.... tankers have had to turn around, full, and return to russia as dock workers in the intended countries refused to unload it, and no-one else wanted to buy it, even absent oil sanctions.

What they're losing in price, they're not making up in volume, they're losing both price and volume on oil.

So its really unclear to me how they could be net benefitting from high prices.

Gas.... prices have risen.... but were there EU sanctions there would be nowhere they could deliver it to take advantage of the higher price.

Oil....prices for Urals have declined.... so even if they do shift it elsewhere, they make less money, and very few places seem to want to take it.",ac00dc30faa1494aa7c5e6ee34f55e95baabd1ad,True,False,,,,,0,1651511891,,0,{},i71u1x4,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i71mzox,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i71u1x4/,1651511902,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651483091.0,

1. NATO is arming a proxy and giving it real-time intelligence to kill tens of thousands of Russians and seems set on destroying the conventional Russian military. Every military defeat, every dead Russian deepens Russian hostility.
2. Russia chauvinistically regards said proxy as its imperial domain. The romantic, unhinged way that Russian elites talk about Ukraine makes me think that at least some of them view the conflict in a ""victory or death"" light.
3. The Russian regime is distinctly more vicious, brutal, bloodthirsty, and unhinged in its internal politics and external rhetoric than the post-Stalin Soviet Union.
4. Lots of people in western countries seem to have no fear of nuclear war. They don't seek to minimize its risk because I don't think they have any real appreciation for what it would entail. This of course comes on the heels of 30 years of unquestioned US hegemony and lopsided conflicts with adversaries that could never out-escalate it.

The main issues during the early 80s seem to have been rooted in ignorance and mistrust. The Soviet Union was committed to avoiding nuclear war, and we now know that it would never have initiated an aggressive nuclear war, but it was incredibly paranoid and ignorant about western intentions. We are uncertain as to whether a similarly deep commitment now exists in Russia.

There was also more of a conventional parity between the Soviet Union and NATO/the west that kept an uneasy balance of power in place. Since modern Russia's conventional military has been revealed as a paper tiger, lots of people in the west are beginning to exhibit a lack of restraint in dealing with a nuclear adversary.

No, you just fail to understand things. 

&gt;You think they just pulled out because they weren't actually serious about taking Kyiv or something? 

That's exactly what happened. That offensive was meant to be over in days, their faulty intelligence indicated there wouldn't be strong resistance and meant to decapitate the Ukrainian government at the beginning of the war. When they met much stiffer resistance than they expected, and failed to besiege Kyiv, they entirely gave up on their strategic objectives in that sector and decided to redirect those troops to try to expand their holdings out of Donbas. It's extremely obvious if you've been paying any attention actually.

The Russian front in the east is not going to collapse in days like Kyiv. Mark my words. As much as we want Ukraine to win no amount of wishful thinking is going to make a repeat of Kyiv. You have to try to separate what you want to happen and what is likely to happen.

More than likely Russia has turned down production because its just not finding buyers. This hurts them in the long run.

Russia can still make arms though, I think people downplay how quickly a nation state can find alternative sources of needed resources. The question is how big is the delay and if quantities will match previous ones. 

Also the West doesn't want Russia to collapse. All these sanctions are pretty soft because deposing Putin and destabilizing Russia means nukes on the loose and the potential, if not likelihood, for a hard-liner to take Putin's throne. So there's a bit of an effort here to not hurt Russia too much. Also it makes it easier to remove the sanctions after peace is declared.

So badly hurting Russia isn't the current strategy. Just hurting them a bit. Showing them we can badly hurt them if need be seems to be what the West is doing.

Kyiv was initially targeted in the belief that a coup de main attack on it would trigger the collapse of the Ukraine govt. Obviously that was not the case by mid March, even if Kyiv fell it wouldn't end the war. Plus, they didn't have the troops to take Kyiv, so their choice was to either abandon Donbas to reinforce the Kyiv front, a useless strategic objective, or abandon Kyiv to reinforce Donbas. 

What's happening now in Kharkiv and Chuhuiv are spoiling attacks. Proactive counterattacks done against weak Russian sectors that have the ability to threaten them, that they can't ignore them, so they have to either commit part of their operational reserve or bleed units already tasked with a current mission involving the Severodonetsk salient offensive. 

What was happening at Kyiv were standard counterattacks to try to blunt the offensive that turned into harrying attacks as they realized the Russians were retreating. 

All of this is made possible because of western intelligence fed to the Ukraines, who have access to high quality SIGINT, HUMINT, and IMINT so they pretty much know where every Russian unit is positioned, what they're doing, planning to do, and starting to do. In situations like that the best approach is to continuously disrupt enemy operations. If they manage to stop the Chuhuiv attack then start pressing elsewhere, like near Kharkiv. When they move forces to stop that, the Ukrainians will attack somewhere else. Meanwhile, a lot of the units the Russians planned to use in the Severodonetsk salient offensive ended up committed elsewhere.

Yeah, I mean the most obvious reality here is that the Russians were NOT EXPECTING TO GET SHOT AT. So they weren't on high alert, they weren't tuned in to every twitch happening on the horizon, and they probably didn't realize there were incoming ASCMs until radar picked it up 10-15nmi out... 

Assuming 550kt cruise speed - that's about 1-2 minutes of reaction time - not bad if you are already on high alert expecting to get shot at... but if the russians believed there was nothing that could target them, it seems conceivable that they wouldn't be on a constant alert and might be taking some liberties with reaction time. 

Add to that some moments of delay asking superiors for advice/explaining situation... and  I really don't think it is surprising.

*The US needs a new approach to producing weapons. Just look at Ukraine.*

https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2022/04/26/the-us-needs-a-new-approach-to-producing-weapons-just-look-at-ukraine/

&gt; * ...it has become increasingly apparent such weapons are neither cheap nor available in unlimited numbers. 

&gt; * Indeed, the United States has reportedly provided Kyiv one-third of its overall stockpile of Javelins.

&gt; * ...the United States cannot count on similar help should the roles be reversed.

&gt; * The war in Ukraine is but the most recent reminder that 21st century warfare is munitions intensive.

&gt; * The effectiveness of precision weaponry against invading Russian forces has been impressive but has also highlighted the fact that the current U.S. munitions infrastructure is not robust enough to support a high-intensity, protracted conflict against a major adversary such as Russia or China. 

&gt; * ...the requirement for greater investment in munitions is a recurring finding of wargames and strategic choices exercises...

&gt; * The war in Ukraine has highlighted lethality of modern precision weapons on the battlefield, but also the fragility of the current munitions base.

&gt; * The United States cannot enter the next war with inadequate stocks of precision munitions, nor would it be acceptable to cut off allies from resupply in order to husband limited stockpiles for its own defense. 

&gt; * Rather, the United States needs to work with its close allies to both increase their collective munitions stockpiles and production capacity while also adopting innovative approaches to munitions production.

Mahnken is president and chief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a senior research professor at The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.*",b3312e9d6cebcab2fed19ae5e47b966892118072,True,False,,,,,0,1651506621,,0,{},i71gvo9,False,t3_ugrjje,False,True,t3_ugrjje,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugrjje/flexibility_in_the_us_defense_industrial_base_and/i71gvo9/,1651506634,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651477821.0,

I think Finland and Sweden joining NATO is great for NATO. Sweden punches well above their weight in terms of military arms development. The NLAW is a collaboration between the UK and Sweden for example. Joining NATO, and having to meet NATO standards will probably also be a big help for Sweden's defense industry.  They will have even better access to the NATO market and companies like Saab will be able to join collaborations, whereas they were falling further and further behind Lock-Mart.

Finland provides a large trained manpower base that buttresses NATO's northern flank against Russia. With Finland and Sweden joining the Baltic will be completely closed to Russia and it puts St. Petersburg in a vice. Instead of Norway's northern tip around Tromso being vulnerable, as it was during the Cold War, now that script is flipped. Finnish airspace provides easy access to the White Sea, which is the bastion for the Russian SSBM fleet. Murmansk and Arkhangelsk could be targeted by air power.

Kari who focuses on the expectation that the leader is ""infallible"" and the consequences this has on succession.  Briefly, Putin doesn't make ""mistakes"" (in the official party explanation of the world) his subordinates simply fail to accurately carry out his always perfect orders.  So, being a high profile subordinate is a fairly guaranteed way to develop a public record too blemished to allow for promotion to leadership (since they would fail to be infallible).  Instead, a successor candidate would be ""castled"" (like the chess move, tucked away and protected) and then one day reappear, with only a couple of heroic sounding achievements from before they disappeared from the public light, and be pronounced the new leader.  This is of course not the Putin-is-overthrown scenario, but is the analog to Putin suddenly stepping down / poor health.  The most likely successor now (Kari also mentions Yevgeny Zinitdiev but he sadly fell of a cliff, no joke, since that lecture) is Alexei Djumin.  He rose quickly, was prominent both in the annexation of Crimea, and responsible for the ""rescue"" of Yanukovych when Ukraine overthrew him.  He is one of the VERY few recipients of the title ""Hero of Russia"" who is currently (a) alive, (b) not an astronaut, and (c) the right age.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/29/urkaine-russian-soviet-weapons/

KYIV, Ukraine — In a town near the front with Russia in eastern Ukraine, grease-stained Ukrainian soldiers huddled over the engine hatch of a battle-damaged T-64BV battle tank. They had been working for three days straight.

“Fortunately, it wasn’t a direct hit and the crew survived,” said their commander, Zhenya, who for security reasons gave only his first name. “But the engine had to be replaced.”

Inside this makeshift workshop near Ukraine’s eastern front, soldiers in teams worked round-the-clock to repair the tanks and other vehicles that are the backbone of Ukraine’s military resistance to Russia’s invasion — Soviet-designed and -built equipment once destined for soldiers with allegiance to Moscow.

The Soviet Union, and later Russia, was a major arms exporter, seeding Eastern Europe in particular with tanks, artillery pieces, armored personnel carriers and air defense systems that are cheaper and simpler to use than U.S. weapons, experts said. With Eastern European countries sending equipment to Ukraine, that means Moscow has effectively armed its own enemy — one that was once at the heart of the Soviet Union’s weapons production and innovation.

Now Ukraine has harnessed its Soviet-era inventory against Moscow. In a strange full-circle moment, for instance, Ukrainian hands built both the Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet that sank this month off Odessa, and the missiles used to destroy it.

“Most of the equipment in the Ukrainian military at the beginning of the war was Soviet-era,” said **Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.** In addition to the tanks, Ukraine’s aircraft and artillery originate from that period, he said — and artillery, in particular, has proved decisive in fighting the Russians since the war began.

Antitank weapons from the West, including Javelins from the United States, are perhaps the “most visible but not necessarily the most numerous” of the weapons at Ukraine’s disposal, Cancian said.

“It’s always awkward when you end up equipping both sides of a conflict,” Cancian said.

The Ukrainians and other former Warsaw Pact countries still use many Soviet weapons, mostly because of existing stockpiles, said **Jeremy Shapiro, director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations.**

Despite the vehicles’ age, maintaining them and upgrading their components has greatly extended their service life. The armor and electronics may evolve, Shapiro said, “but the things that fire metal aren’t that different.”

The reliance on Soviet and Russian weaponry has at times made it a challenge for the United States and NATO partners to provide weapons Ukrainian troops need. For instance, U.S. artillery pieces provided to Ukraine use 155 mm rounds, which are incompatible with their howitzers. Instead of rushing munitions to the front, the United States must also send the guns, while also providing training to artillerymen in another country.

U.S. and Western officials are gathering in Germany to discuss the path forward in its defense relationship with Ukraine, including evaluating the willingness of Ukraine to be weaned off Russian equipment, U.S. officials have said.

“Transitioning from that equipment to NATO standard is something that will take years, even decades,” Cancian said. “So this is not something that’s going to happen overnight, but I think both sides want to start the process.”

That would also mean the gradual decommission of T-64 variants, a mainstay of Ukrainian stocks.

First built in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in the 1960s, the T-64 revolutionized tank design by including an autoloader, which cut the crew size from four to three. The aging hulls have been outfitted with upgraded electronics, modern armor and improved gun systems. Modernized variants of the T-64 are the most common tank in the Ukrainian military, according to the **London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.**

Many have been damaged by enemy fire, and others are in need of replacement parts after hours of navigating muddy fields and potholed roads. For Ukrainian mechanics, vehicles like it are the most challenging repair, but they are some of the most valuable pieces of equipment on the country’s eastern front, where Ukrainian forces have battled Moscow-backed separatists for nearly a decade.

Some T-64 variants have been involved in high-profile moments, such as a lone T-64BV that, according to analysts, ambushed an entire Russian column in an attack captured on video and shared on social media earlier this month. T-64BVs were produced through 1987.

The tanks also underscore Ukraine’s long-standing status as a military laboratory.

Ukraine — home to many factories and technical institutions — was a vital part of the Soviet defense industry. By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of the industry was based there, according to **Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King’s College London.** Ukraine specialized in missile production and shipbuilding.

The domestically made Neptune missile that Ukrainian forces used to sink the Moskva was based on the design of an old Soviet cruise missile called the Kh-35 that had been produced in Kharkiv — the Detroit of the Eastern European military industry.

After the Soviet Union disintegrated, Ukraine continued to ship helicopter engines, transport aircraft, rockets, missiles and gas turbine engines to Russia, German said.

Ukraine was the world’s 14th-largest arms exporter from 2017 to 2021, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The country has upgraded Soviet-designed tanks, vehicles and weapons in recent decades and continued to produce its own arms, including the Neptune missile. The state arms manufacturer, Ukroboronprom, comprises state-owned defense enterprises that employ nearly 70,000 skilled workers.

Russian attacks since February have dealt a blow to Ukrainian weapons production. After Ukraine struck the Moskva, Russia attacked a factory on the edge of Kyiv that had been involved in the production of Neptune missiles and Alder precision-guided rockets.

“Both militaries are using different variations or generations of what is principally Soviet weaponry,” said **Michael Kofman, research program director in the Russia-studies program at CNA,** a nonprofit research and analysis organization.

Ukrainian fighter pilots in old jets take on better-equipped Russians

The bulk of Ukraine’s military hardware before the current Russian invasion consisted of late-generation Soviet equipment dating from the 1980s. Ukraine made a push to update some older designs after Russia first invaded the Donbas region in 2014. The Russians, though, had more-sophisticated versions of the same type of weapons, Kofman said.

Both sides are trying to incorporate more modern weapons, including drones, into battlefield arsenals that mainly date from Soviet times, he said. Modern Western antitank guided missiles and manned portable air defense systems have given the Ukrainians a boost.

And the Soviet-era arms keep coming. Eastern European countries have been more than happy to offload their old equipment to Ukraine in exchange for newer models from the West. It’s a “win-win-win” situation, Cancian said.

Poland is sending Soviet-designed T-72 tanks to Ukraine, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Monday, and Slovakia provided Ukraine with the S-300 antiaircraft missile defense system after Washington offered to replace it with the Patriot system, which is more advanced.

The Czech Republic has sent T-72s, which began service in 1973, to help bolster Ukraine’s tank inventory.

Western countries have tried to tread a fine line between arming Ukraine and provoking Moscow. The United States rejected Poland’s offer last month to send Soviet-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine in exchange for American-made planes, out of concern of triggering a direct conflict between Russia and NATO.",6645c2c7f0197ddece2e8de348eb8c0cb759356c,True,False,,,,,0,1651500355,,0,{},i7126kj,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t3_ugo0q5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i7126kj/,1651500366,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651471555.0,

EPISODE SUMMARY

&gt; May 1, 2022: Dmitri Alperovitch talks with Michael Kofman (Research Program Director in the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analysis) and Nolan Peterson (Ukraine-based Senior Editor of Coffee or Die Magazine) about the new developments in the war in Ukraine on Twitter Spaces. Discussion of the state of the Ukrainian military and whether the western weapons aid is getting to the front lines, economic conditions in Ukraine, fight for the Donbas, Russian Chief of General Staff Gerasimov's apparent visit to the front-lines in Izyum and how this has become a war of artillery.

This video of a Russian PGM doing minor damage to a Ukrainian agricultural facility makes me skeptical that they will be able to pull off the ""destroy Ukrainian rail and industrial infrastructure"" strategy that Kremlin hardliners are reportedly pushing for.

They have a limited stock of PGMs, they keep burning them on stupid targets, they don't even seem that accurate, and they don't even do that much damage.

Any talks of a negotiated settlement is highly unpopular among the West, but there are [sensible](https://unherd.com/2022/04/how-the-ukraine-war-must-end/) (my opinion) ones.

&gt;This loose but influential lobby holds that victory for Ukraine is a victory for Nato and the West, so defeat for Ukraine must mean their defeat as well. It follows that enough military support must reach Ukraine to allow it to expel Russia’s forces, including in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.  
&gt;  
&gt;For this lobby, the greatest short-term threat is a ceasefire or, even worse, an armistice with Russian forces still in control of Ukrainian territory, providing a dangerous bargaining chip for Moscow.  
&gt;  
&gt;While Putin cannot be given the two regions he demanded before starting the war, he can be provided with something that he can portray as a victory: plebiscites in both regions where properly certified residents, including returning refugees, would be allowed to vote on whether their oblast should remain Ukrainian or join Russia.  
  
Upon acceptance of the plebiscites in principle, a cease-fire would come into immediate effect, with Russia’s respect of their terms guaranteed by the ease of reimposing sanctions just lifted.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a model for this. Plebiscites proved surprisingly effective after the Versailles Treaty in disputed territories ranging from Belgium to Poland. In spite of the enormous devastation and loss of life brought about by the Great War, and the bureaucratic shortcomings of newly formed states, the votes in 1919 went well enough to prevent further border wars.   
&gt;  
&gt;All of this is anathema for the victory lobby. But its twin goals of driving out the Russians by force and bringing down Putin in the process would only be desirable if nuclear weapons could be un-invented. As it is, they offer Russia a court of appeal when facing conventional defeat, in a manner that negates any conventional victory — something that is surely infinitely worse than the outcome of any referendum.",dbd83326566542d8ba027cefafc170ffbd10fc69,True,False,,,,,0,1651496383,,0,{},i70txy2,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i70qev0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i70txy2/,1651496396,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651467583.0,

I mean, would that change if they stopped land pushing?  The frontline has barely moved last month and yet they've managed to fix many Ukrainian units in place for long periods of time.

Especially one thing pretty much every frontline Ukranian agrees on is that Russian air is still bullying the ever living fuck out of them.  Ukraine clearly has anti-air, but whatever anti-air they have is currently insufficient to prevent Russia's planes from conducting fixing attacks against the Donbas region.

Fortunately Russia is unable to exploit air superiority nearly as well as America, but it's still a standing issue.  Between them and artillery, Ukranian freedom of movement (especially to make large-scale advances) isn't all that free.

&gt;Going on the defensive will not solve Russian attrition and supply problems. It might ease the problems, but what on earth would be the point of taking attrition without any hope for a victory?

Well, they'd offer a ceasefire (which Ukraine would promptly decline) and then they'd probably stage a prolonged artillery tennis match along the frontline.  With their mobile forces no longer pushing, both sides would depend heavily on artillery bombardment to inflict continued attrition, and Russia would presumably hope to be better off there.

When I made my original assessment back in early March, I felt Russia had a significant advantage to that end, both in volume and capacity of artillery.

We all know how the Kremlin conducts its foreign information war, using troll farms, conspiracy-peddling state media, and abusive officials who belittle and insult anyone who dares to criticize them. Democratic governments’ efforts to reach everyday Russians have to be utterly different. Think online town halls involving ordinary Russians, where Western celebrities who have large Russian fan bases, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger (whose recent video appeal to his Russian fans got millions of views) envision a different Russia. Think responsive media, where Russians can ask for details about what is happening at the front, and receive evidence-based answers. Think online forums, where doctors discuss how ordinary people can manage the looming Russian health crisis, or YouTube channels where psychologists delve into the psychological stresses that Russians are experiencing.

There was an interesting [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-being-anti-science-is-now-part-of-many-rural-americans-identity) on science skepticism in America that touched on something similar. Arkansas Fish and Game needed to change the way they managed a bayou in a way that would result in fewer ducks stopping at the bayou, which meant less duck hunting for the hunters and associated businesses.

The director of Arkansas Fish and Game (Austin Booth) knew that if they planned a town hall and just had an academic talk at the community members, it would go over as well as the city council meetings we've seen on COVID measures. So here's what he did:

&gt;Instead, he decided the meetings would be dinners where the Game and Fish staff would eat alongside the people they sought to convince. “I just believe there’s a human component to sitting down and having a meal with someone,” he said. At those dinners, he’d give a brief introduction, then invite people to ask questions of the staff as they ate and mingled.

&gt;At the end of the dinners, Booth said he’d stand up again and ask, “Is there anyone that’s going to walk through that door tonight without their questions answered or comments taken for the record, or with their concerns ignored?” No one, he said, came forward. The four dinners were attended by between 50 and 100 people, according to Booth, but those attendees then spread the word, dampening criticism of the new management system.

Sometimes, but every fight is different.  It's a lot easier to look at the circumstances than trying to cite historical trends imo.

This time around, despite what they're vehemently asserting, they're not actually in a fight for their lives, they're trying to conduct a massive land grab against a well-armed people that in some ways **are** in a fight for their lives.  

Russia's traditional tenacity isn't really designed for this kind of affair, so even the meaning of ""last"" is a bit unclear.  ""Last"" in the sense that they'll nowhere close to finishing their land grab?  I don't think so.  Without significant mobilization and R&amp;R, Donbas is their last push, and it's not even clear whether they'll succeed that one.

""Last"" in the sense that they'll be able to hold some or all of their important current land grabs after switching to a defensive posture?  That's more possible.  In early or mid march, I did a writeup saying that if Russia switches to defense, Ukraine not be able to push them back to the Feb 23 borders except around Kyiv.

Today, I am less sure in that assessment, but:

I do think that if/once it assesses further offense impossible, Russia will absolutely switch to defense and support that fight for at least half a year, if not longer.  And I think they do have that capacity - Ukrainians are doing well on defense, but in their own words it's coming at a cost, and offense is going to be objectively harder, especially since elements of Russia's army synergize well with a defensive posture.

So it's possible Russia could ""last"" in the sense they prevent/significantly delay Ukrainian restoration of the feb 23 borders.",07de898d9f0410a11a99084ee27f22dfa896b30d,True,False,,,,,0,1651479777,,0,{},i706w2v,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i705xqm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i706w2v/,1651479791,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651450977.0,

I found it utterly bizarre when i was on a bus from st petersburg to moscow and we got stopped by the police whilst they took their 'statutory bribe'. Apparently it's normal because it's illegal not to have a seatbelt on, so they just pull buses over and take a payment rather than issuing a fine. It was only about £5 or something too IIRC.

Then when i was in Moscow i watched a guy getting his head stomped into the ground whilst a security guy just watched on in the background and did nothing. They just don't get paid enough to care or to risk their own safety.

Whatever they have left that is designed to be used conventionally is likely(in my entirely amatuer opinion) very old and poorly maintained. Russia quite obviously maintains chemical and biological weapons development program for small scale use.

The problem with large scale chemical weapons use is you need the right weather conditions, wind and humidity. Multiple times in World War 1 the wind shifted and the gas ended up off target, or even over their own men. You also need density, most chemical weapons require large amounts of the agent to be distributed to cover a large area. This typically means a large amount of either conventional artillery or rocket artillery, and the logistics to transport the ammunition. Counter battery fire hitting stockpiles could end up gassing the Russians. Apart from that you want open spaces, and trenches are ideal targets as chemical agents are typically heavier than air. 

The last large scale use was the Iraq-Iran war, from the Iraqi side. Somewhat notable but unrelated is the fact the US, among other nations, knowingly sold them the precursors to manufacture said weapons. There aren't really firm numbers as to what the overall casualties rates were, especially in comparison to the effort used to produce said weapons. More so as Iraq targeted civilians as well. The Halabja massacre that targeted Iraqi Kurds is extremely well known for example. The greatest effect chemical weapons had in this war was physiological. Gas brings hysteria, especially to soldiers and/or civilians that aren't prepared for it. The same can be said for WW1, and the Italian-Ethiopian War. Long term health effects are a terrible secondary effect.

Sorry, kinda of long winded. I doubt Russia has the capacity to effectively use chemical weapons on a large scale, stockpile wise or logistically. I'm doubtful they'd choose to use them over a more effective solution like tactical nuclear weapons, as chemical or biological agents used in a mass scale would likely be viewed on the same level from outside observers.",c91b98045ed1e89627f8b4ab315bf2f01b578a1c,True,False,,,,,0,1651477163,,0,{},i703x1z,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i700tnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i703x1z/,1651477178,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651448363.0,

Poisoning diplomats is one thing, but do we know if the Russians actually have significant stockpiles of an appropriate chemical to use if they wanted to? I know the soviets had programs, and that many weapons systems at one point had a chemical loadout option like a shell or a missile that could carry a chemical payload. However do we know if any of these are still kept by the Russians?

I accept some of this may be uncertain as they might have limited stockpiles in a secret location, but even if they have the chemicals, and the weapons, how likely is it to be succesfully deployed by a force that hasn’t trained with those type of weapons? 

Like anything else, there’s probably a science to picking targets, handling the munitions and so on, do they have this institutional knowledge, or would they be more or less winging it?

They've constructed underground hangers at this base and this base has been historically considered to be a safe rear area beyond the central mountain to the east side of the island. It also hosts a major ROCN naval base right next door.

As it's considered a rear area it's lightly defended from the ground. An assault by PLANMC launched by 075 and 071 circling to the eastern side of the island could do some seriously damage. Obviously ROC know that 075 are starting to enter service and could prepare for this eventuality by relocating some of their troops to the east, but then that would weaken the positions in the west facing the main assault.

Relocating troops between east and west side of the island is non-trivial as there's no path through the mountain range that sits in the middle of the island, so to transfer troops between the two side of the islands require them to travel along the major highways that circle the island near the coast, this is extremely dangerous to do in time of war. During 2019 Han Kuang Exercise ROCMC 99th Marine Brigade was traveling from their base in Kaohsiung to Taipei and was ruled by the JLTS simulation system to have lingered too long at Hengchun Railway Station and was ""hit"" by PLA long range rocket artillery and tactical ballistic missile and completely wiped out and taken out of the exercise.

If Wikipedia is to be believed we actually can get a breakdown of what the British Army has quite easily. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery) and [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army#Artillery) both say that they use just 3 actual artillery systems: the US [M270 MLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System), of which that page says they have 42; the [AS-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-90) 155 mm self-propelled howitzer, of which that page says they are the only operator and 179 were produced in a three year period (so most should still be in service); and the [L118 105 mm towed artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L118_light_gun) of which that page says they have 126. That would make the AS-90 their most common weapon by a significant margin, with the MLRS further padding the advantage of the self-propelled systems if you want to count them. Germany's [PzH 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerhaubitze_2000) is in the news a fair bit since they're sending several to Ukraine, which will add to Ukraine's previous stock of Soviet [2S19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S19_Msta) and [2S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S3_Akatsiya) 152 mm self-propelled howitzers (they had 40 of 2S19 and 130 of its towed variant, and 501 2S3 and 130+ of its towed variant, as well as rocket artillery and I don't have any evidence that this is an exhaustive list).

Using nuclear weapons, even tactical ones, is opening up a pandora's box that nobody knows what to expect. Putin and his council are not all-knowing. They are aware that they are not all-knowing. If they start nuking stuff, they don't know what the response will be.

If they are not suicidal, they won't do it unless facing some sort of existential threat. Once there's a hot war between Russia and NATO, then you can start worrying about nukes.

&gt; If Putin cannot bring about victory via conventional means, is this likely?

As long as the Russians are making gains every day, and so far they slowly have been, there's no way that he will use nukes even if the long term prospects aren't going well for Russia",abee8d5f3e38d4861b25f38a4089888fe499e48e,True,False,,,,,0,1651470572,,0,{},i6zvu7g,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i6zt2ur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6zvu7g/,1651470583,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651441772.0,
[],False,,hatesranged,,,[],,,,text,t2_3svjqav4,False,False,"Here are some reasons why not, mostly collected from what I and others have said earlier in this thread:

a) a tactical nuke to try and break the Ukrainian front in the East or south does not work because you'd be nuking the area you're explicitly trying to annex

b) if a) wasn't reason enough, let's play some universe sandbox:

https://imgur.com/7AF8kPn

So let's let a 50 kT bomb rip over Sloviansk, which is one of the hubs of the Ukrainian defense line.  The orange circle indicates significant chance of immediate serious injury to unprotected infantry, the green circle (ish) dedicates universal injury/death and collapse of most buildings.  Outside of the light grey circle?  Most windows won't even break.

Now compare that radius to the current positional maps (you can use Izium, Yampil and Lyman as easy roadsigns).

You haven't covered all that much of Ukraine's defensive perimeter despite using a relatively large tactical charge.  So it's not like one nuke erodes Ukraine's defenses that much, you'd have to use quite a few.

c) Suppose you do absolutely carpet the Ukrainian defenses with nukes, then what?  You've ostensibly killed a lot of them and destroyed their cover, but your tactical objective is to then advance... into the terrain you just absolutely macerated in radiation, essentially giving the Ukrainians a whole new level of defense.

Button up with your NBC-proof vehicles and roll in?  Considering it's unclear how much defense a lot of the armored vehicles provide in a real world scenario, even your most patriotic soldiers are going to be pretty hesitant, and... the Ukrainians have NBC vehicles too, so it won't be a scouting/cleanup mission, it'll still be a combat mission.

d) Ok, so a tactical nuke to reduce their defenses seems unwise for many reasons-what about one to break their spirits, aimed at Kyiv, Lviv, or Odesa?

That stretches the meaning of ""tactical"", but either way, that probably won't work as cleanly as it did in Japan.  It may have the opposite effect of forcing capitulation, even if you do kill Zelensky.  Hell, especially if you kill Zelensky.

e) any tactical nuclear launch by Russia has a high chance of being detected by NATO with a variety of methods.  So not only you risk NATO panicking and getting ready to counterattack, but the Ukrainians probably get some warning too, depending on the method.  So your problems begin before the nukes even land.

f) The diplomatic (and even internal) consequences for dropping a nuke in any context cannot be overstated.  Even if it won't lead to war or an ultimatum from NATO (it might), it will lead to the complete collapse of Russian diplomatic influence.  Even China would probably seriously consider disavowing you, while fence-sitters like India, Brazil, and Israel?  Gone, outta here.

In short, there is no rational or even semi-rational case for Russia to use tactical nukes at present.

Its interesting that this particularly seems to concern factories, not agriculture, as historically women on farms were quite simply expected to work along with everyone else as a matter of survival. Therefore the idea of the delicately feminine woman who didn’t have a job beyond “homemaker” was probably only economically viable for a relatively small number of germans anyway. 

I’m trying to figure out a timeline of laws being passed that obligated women in various countries to work in war production, and get some idea of if there’s any truth to the idea that the germans had fewer women in that area than say, the russians did, or that an institutional reluctance had a measurable impact on the available labor force.

1. Personnel, Ukraine is mobilizing, Russia is not. If the casualties are 1:1, the current situation is not sustainable for Russia. Due to defenders advantage it's more likely that the casualty rate is more in favor of Ukraine.
2. Material. Ukraine is getting resupplied by the west, Russia has some industrial ability to produce war material, but it's way more limited than the western support for Ukraine that can flood it with tens of thousands of shells 200 tanks and over 100 artillery pieces within a single month. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Ukraine is getting **better** equipment than the one Russia currently has. The technological gap is only going to increase and get worse for Russia. For instance Russia has an advantage in the air, but they've already lost \~10% of their ka-52 fleet, given that some significant percent of the fleet will always be unavailable due to maintenance, we're talking about a significant hit to their CAS ability already which is only going to get worse.

*Russia’s top officer visited the front line to change the offensive’s course, U.S. and Ukraine officials say.*

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/world/europe/russian-general-dead-valery-gerasimov.html

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — The chief of the general staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the country’s highest ranking uniformed officer, made a visit to dangerous front-line positions in eastern Ukraine late last week in an effort to “change the course” of Russia’s flagging offensive there, according to a senior Ukrainian official. Two U.S. officials with knowledge of the visit also backed that assessment.

Ukrainian officials learned of the visit, the Ukrainian official said, but not in time to catch General Gerasimov. When Ukrainian forces launched an attack on one position visited by General Gerasimov, at School No. 12 in the Russian-controlled city of Izium on Saturday evening, he had already departed for Russia. Still, some 200 soldiers, including at least one general, were killed, the Ukrainian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military operation.

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments, confirmed that General Gerasimov had been in eastern Ukraine for the past couple days, but had no information about the attack on the Russian base. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Our working assumption is that he was there because there’s a recognition they haven’t worked out all their problems yet,” said one of the officials.

The presence of such a high-ranking official on the front lines is highly unusual and comes amid what Western military analysts describe as increasing disarray within Russian forces. Even with dramatically scaled down objectives, Western officials and analysts say the Russian military continues to struggle with logistical problems and coordination among its troops, while facing persistently fierce resistance from the Ukrainians.

Izium, a medium-sized city in eastern Ukraine, has become a base of operations for the Russian military as it pursues an offensive meant to wrest away the two eastern Ukrainian territories bordering Russia that make up the region known as the Donbas. The successful seizure of the area would represent a consolation prize for the Kremlin, after an embarrassing withdrawal from the region around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, which, according to U.S. intelligence assessments, the Russian leadership had expected to fall within days of invasion.

But even in the east progress has been slow. Russian forces have been able to make incremental gains, day by day, taking some villages, while losing others, as strongly entrenched Ukrainian troops put up stalwart resistance.

General Gerasimov sits at the right hand of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and is one of only three people, along with the president and the minister of defense, who were principally in charge of plotting the course of the war from its outset. This strict hierarchy that defines Russia’s military leadership is one reason Western analysts say Russia’s forces have so often appeared unable to adapt quickly to changing battlefield conditions.

For more than a month after the war started, Russian forces lacked a battlefield commander who might guide the action from inside Ukraine, leading to poor coordination among different units and services that has contributed to the deaths of thousands of troops. It also led to the deaths of 10 or more generals who had moved into front-line positions to try to untangle the mess.

Early last month, the Kremlin finally appointed a seasoned commander, Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, who was accused of ordering airstrikes on civilian neighborhoods in Syria, to oversee forces on the ground in Ukraine.

Russia-Ukraine War: Key Developments
Card 1 of 3
Pelosi’s visit. In a sign of the United States’ deepening commitment to Ukraine, Speaker Nancy Pelosi became the most senior American official to visit Kyiv, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and vowing to back Ukraine “until victory is won.”

Mariupol evacuation. The long-awaited rescue of civilians from a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol is underway, according to Ukrainian officials and the United Nations. Mr. Zelensky said that about 100 civilians were being evacuated and are heading to a “controlled area.”

Russian oil embargo. European Union countries are likely to approve a phased embargo on Russian oil, sealing a long-postponed measure that has divided the bloc’s members and highlighted their dependence on Russian energy sources. E.U. ambassadors expect to give their final approval by the end of the week, officials said.

American officials said General Gerasimov’s secret visit to the eastern front underscores the problems Russian forces are confronting in the Donbas.

“It likely means things are not going well for the Russians,” Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and former Army Ranger, said in a telephone interview from Poland after visiting Ukraine on Saturday with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“They’ve had thousands killed in action, troop morale is low, and, very significantly, their offensive in the south and east appears to be stalled,” Mr. Crow said.

General Gerasimov had been in eastern Ukraine for several days and arrived on Saturday during the day at School No. 12, which was being used as a base by Russia’s Second Combined Arms Army, as well as airborne forces deployed to the region, the senior Ukrainian official said. According to preliminary information gathered by Ukrainian forces, Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov, who was among the commanders at the base in Izium, was killed in the attack.

“The decision to destroy this object was taken not because of Gerasimov, but because it is an important base of operations,” the official said.",665de97f6c441d4839e44696e588ae10fc2256e4,True,False,,,,,0,1651451613,,0,{},i6yyvw3,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t3_ufyebi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6yyvw3/,1651451632,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651422813.0,

It is not so much that they are wrong, but rather that anyone who follows the PLA knows that the term ""conscript"" or ""conscription cycle"" in the Chinese military context is better understood as ""enlisted"" or ""enlistment cycle"". The term ""conscript"" in the PLA is a carry over of Chinese conscription law that has never been enforced since the nation's founding.

The paper itself is decent, and Mr Blasko is good writer.

But as far as the understanding of ""conscription"" goes, the term is used with the understanding that it describes volunteers, not some sort of mandatory draft (such as in Israel, ROK, or Singapore etc).",e12d92fa1739c9221ed3ae1a960f8b7f40768eca,True,False,,,,,0,1651450090,,0,{},i6yvulp,False,t3_ug7qo2,False,True,t1_i6yopk8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ug7qo2/the_pla_army_amphibious_force_missions/i6yvulp/,1651450101,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651421290.0,
