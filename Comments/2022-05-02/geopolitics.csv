[],False,,smt1,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cr5e,False,False,"&gt;So what's your take?

russian militarists like igor girkin don't think the donbass offensive is going very well at this point (for Russian goals, which is to occupy all of the Donbass areas of Ukraine), and he's very critical of the russian government for not ordering a larger mobilisation. it appears that Ukraine is willing to make strategic tactical retreats from smaller villages, so that's the full extent of what Russia has been able to take since the new offensive started, which is about a month. 

I think girkin's analysis is pretty reliable because it's from the Russian side yet cuts through the government line. 

a translation of his analysis from a few days ago below, my emphasis added.





The area south of Izyum:

fierce fighting continues along the entire perimeter of the Russian bridgehead. There are tactical advances everywhere.

According to incoming reports, the most fierce battles are taking place on the right flank - in the area of ​​the village of Velikaya Kamyshevakha (and, possibly, directly in the village), as well as ""on the edge"" of the offensive - in the center of the bridgehead - in the area (possibly - and on the territory) of the village of Novaya Dmitrovka.

After taking the indicated villages our troops will approach directly the Barvenkovo-Slavyansk highway and create a threat of its interception (which will not be easy, since the settlements along this highway merge into an almost continuous agglomeration).

**It should be noted that the battles are continuous ""viscous"" character. The enemy has enough manpower to - despite the lengthening of the front line in this area - nowhere to allow Russian troops to make deep breakthroughs.**

At the same time, the enemy continues to withdraw his forces from the bridgehead he still has on the left bank of the Seversky Donets - from the Liman-Yampol region and the Severodonetsk ledge, leaving the most advanced positions to the east between Severodonetsk and Popasna (in which fierce fighting continued).

It is assumed that the enemy will soon (today or tomorrow) leave Liman and withdraw his troops to strengthen the flanks of the group - near Barvenkovo ​​and Slavyansk.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the DPR were unable to prevent this and surround the enemy units.

In general, the enemy defends competently, stubbornly, controls the situation and his troops.

There is no panic in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is absolutely clear that their command is betting on **WINNING TIME AND INFLICTING MAXIMUM LOSS ON THE STRIKING UNITS OF THE RF AF (LDNR AF)** \- due to the unhurried surrender of the territory.

Ahead of the Russian troops in this direction is the huge Slavyansk-Kramatorsk agglomeration, which was prepared in advance for a long defense.

Its Armed Forces will definitely not surrender until the last opportunity - defending, if necessary, as a ""besieged fortress"". (In this regard, the fate of the remnants of the Mariupol garrison is of great importance - they should not be released or interned in any case - otherwise the garrison of Slavyansk-Kramatorsk will defend just as long and stubbornly, if not even longer and more stubbornly).

However, this ""fortress"" will still have to be surrounded, which is very difficult to do with the available limited forces and at such a slow pace - at which the enemy freely withdraws his units and prepares new defense units in advance.

In the south - in the area of ​​Gulyai-Pole and Orekhov - the situation has not changed significantly. ""Southern part of the offensive"" have stalled.

In the central section - near Donetsk - the situation as a whole is unchanged. There is a lull in most areas, the fighting is only in the area north of Avdiivka, where the DPR Armed Forces have had minor tactical successes.

**The general conclusion, unfortunately, is bleak: the attack of the Russian group on the encirclement and encirclement of the Donetsk group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which did not come as a surprise, met with fierce resistance and almost certainly will not lead to a complete encirclement and defeat of the enemy. additional tank corps in order to abruptly break through the front and connect deep in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""Cannes"" just didn't work out.**

**In the** ***best*** **case, the enemy will “squeeze out” from the Donbass for many weeks and even - it is possible - for several months, with heavy losses (mutual, of course). That will allow him to create, train and massively introduce strategic reserves into battle in any chosen area without much haste by the summer. And also - to crush Transnistria, gathering sufficient forces for this and not risking defeat near Donetsk during the operation.**",883ef0abc2094c94380dd345e21fa751f5a198d9,True,False,,,,,0,1651512617,,0,{},i71vwgz,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i6z45cn,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i71vwgz/,1651512632,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651483817.0

It is an artificial pipeline diverting the Ukrainian water supply to Crimea for purposes of agricultural terraforming and industry. It does not deprive Crimea of sufficient drinking water sources, other than the increased demand created by Russia invading Crimea and installing a military base there. Furthermore, the canal would have had to be maintained and operated by Ukraine in order to keep the water flowing. 

I do grant that the water pipeline is an important bargaining chip for Ukraine that would be foolish for them to just give up when it could be used to negotiate a cessation of hostilities. But continually framing it as a hostile act to starve Crimeans is a Russian propaganda strategy to muddy the ethical and legal waters of its imperialist aims. Russia tried levying those charges via the UN, but it didn’t work. 

It is not the job of other countries to falsely prop up Russia by giving it benefits it hasn’t earned. I do not mean that only as a moral judgment, but as an estimation of the success of Russia’s military and diplomatic manœuvres. It did not have either the soft power or the credibility to strong-arm the UN into giving any inflated attention or credence to its claims, like the US has been able to do at times.

The Ukrainian government recognized the remaining Tatars’ own legislative and executive representative bodies. But after Russia’s 2014 invasion and annexation of Crimea, which the native Crimeans strongly opposed, Russia labeled the Tatar representation as an “extremist organization,” banned it. Russia eradicated the Tatar-language TV channel and has been inflicting other human rights abuses on the Tatars.

Almost all studies of intrastate conflict (civil wars) point to two factors being the strongest at predicting occurrence and intensity of these conflicts: poverty and availability of an exploitable resource for opposing groups to sustain conflict.

It can be foreign countries giving money or arms, or easily capturable and comidified natural resources like oil, cocaine, opium, etc.

A completely localized civil war can be sustained with no outside interference. There are many cases of countries that went through years-long brutal civil wars where the money came from resource exports sold to criminal organizations while outside countries were pushing for a stop to the conflict so legitimate companies could operate there safely.

Ironically, this is a situation where international monetary aid meant to stop a civil war ends up prolonging it. In a country where many men have no money or job opporunities, the only secure income is combat. The international community is essentially injecting capital into a country whose economy can't sustain a workforce, whose rebel leaders want to use the money to enrich themselves while possibly pushing their own ideological agenda (or power) and whose men only having training in and the opportunity to continue as soldiers.

But crucially, you are either making false claims in bad faith or you are woefully misinformed about the entire Crimean water situation. 

Ukraine is not diverting Crimea’s natural water supply whatsoever. Ukraine had to construct and maintain an artificial canal, the North Crimean Canal, which must be maintained and operated with pumps in order to divert Ukraine’s natural water resources from the Dnipro river into Crimea. This was done not because Crimea has no sufficient sources of drinking water, but in order to artificially terraform the land to better conditions for farming. Then, Russia invaded Crimea and installed a military base, which “sharply increased” the use of water there.

“Importantly, the issue here revolves exactly around positive obligations. Water does not flow naturally into Crimea, and the Canal is an artificial hydraulic structure, which requires human labour to operate. It cannot be compared to a river, but rather (similarly to Hudorovic), to a water pipeline. This pipeline provided water to consumers under the commercial contracts. After Russia took control over the Canal facilities in Crimea, it never officially proposed Ukraine to negotiate a contract on renewal of water supply. Thus, water could not reach the consumers if Ukraine acted negatively (in other words, simply did nothing).”

We could use opinion polls as a proxy, but the results aren't broken down by city, the best we have is region-level breakdown (West, East, South and Center) for some of the items.

TLDR: Most or all the post-2013 changes in opinions can be explained by polls not accounting for ~5-6m people living in Crimea and the separatist territories. Based on that, likely not much had changed in Mariupol either.

There's a significant problem with opinion polls: some people are too cautious to answer honestly to controversial questions and prefer to abstain or virtue signal (26.6-37% say Ukrainians can't freely express their political views). This is happening here in Russia too, where independent pollsters claim that the refusal rate has increased severalfold since the beginning of the war, too many people are unwilling to be polled about the war, rendering any results unrepresentative.
Same with Ukraine, you have to use more neutral questions to gauge their sentiments, else you won't make heads or tails why so many people want the USSR restored yet aren't communists and don't want to join Russia.

If you're interested whether Mariupol is still ethnic Russian, the ethnicity is fairly meaningless. Ukrainians and Russians are like Americans and Canadians, it's mostly a matter of self-identification and family history. Genetics-wise, Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and South Russians are Venn diagrams with enormous overlap, it's pretty much a spectrum. North Russians are a tad different because of intermixing with the Finno-ugric tribes, Balts and even Swedes.

Anyway, the polls:

1: Opinion on the EU. In 2021, even in the government-held areas of the East, [only 38.5% of the population wanted to join the EU](https://i.imgur.com/1b73W78.png). The situation is slightly better in the South, 41.5%. In the West, 83.8%. Nationwide, it fluctuates between 51% and 60% depending on the circumstances (slightly lower in 2019, when pro-Russian Zelensky came to power, slightly higher in 2021 because of the invasion fears).
This is an EXTREMELY important question, because the whole reason why Yanukovych was ousted was because he dropped the idea of joining the EU. The revolution's most common nickname is ""Euromaidan"". If you don't want to join the EU, you pretty much don't share the values of the 2014 Maidan. [Page 106](https://razumkov.org.ua/uploads/article/2021_association.pdf). 

The difference between 2013 and post-war is 5-10%, depending on the year. There are 5-6 million people living in Crimea and the separatist territories, ~13% of the whole Ukrainian population, and their sentiment is pretty much clear (also, anyone who identified strongly with Ukraine has long left those lands).

2. Independency. Only [67.5%](https://i.imgur.com/RUwma7h.png) of all people said that they would vote in favor of independency, up from 56% in 2013. [Page 344](https://razumkov.org.ua/uploads/2021-independence-30.pdf)
[40% of all people](https://i.imgur.com/wboCHIP.png) say independency benefitted them while 29.1% said it turned out bad for them.
[Also see pages 347 and 350](https://i.imgur.com/O8EnECi.png), pretty much everything except for freedom is worse than in 1991. [Only 23.4% of all people](https://i.imgur.com/A1OQgv4.png) think that the overall situation is better than in 1991.
Page 351: [30.6% of all people want the USSR to be restored](https://i.imgur.com/RuLPgUd.png).
Unfortunately, no breakdown by region. 

3. Policy towards Russia. In the South and the East, [only ~30% wanted to reduce cooperation with Russia](https://i.imgur.com/nrceqI8.png) (77.6% in the West, 55.4% nationwide). 48.6% of those in the East wanted to advance cooperation with Russia.

Even if a demographic collapse happens, it will still have way more people than US. Secondly, the only reason US population is not declining is because of immigration. But I am surprised that no one has noticed that immigration has been declining over time and that makes sense. The main reason people migrate from China and India to US is for better salaries. As these countries develop economically, immigration will keep on declining. Not to mention, world population itself is stagnating so immigration is bound to decline. Also, if you look at the GDP per capita of US, it is extremely high (close to USD 70000). Good for them but it also means that the only way it can increase is through innovation. On the other hand, China has millions of poor people and underdeveloped regions. It can grow its GDP for decades just by developing those regions.

If, as you claim, citizens of Crimea have an inherent right to self-determination concerning secession from Ukraine and joining Russia, what of Ukraine’s right to self-determination over the use of its own resources and infrastructure? If you believe Crimea is sovereign and cannot be forced into an agreement or association against its citizens’ will, then a universal application of this rule would permit Ukraine as a sovereign people to stop providing resources and benefits to those outside its borders. Crimea (or Russia, for that matter) would them have no standing to demand otherwise or to incite hostilities over it. 

But another issue with your answer is that it is hypocritical even within Crimea by ignoring the right of self-determination of Crimea’s indigenous Tatar population. The Tatars are a Muslim ethnic group who had been repressed and forcibly relocated from Crimea by the USSR in the past. But even after Russia’s own census, post-annexation, there were still over 246,000 Crimean Tatars on the peninsula, and the Tatars strongly opposed the annexation. 

The indigenous Tatars had created their own representative parliamentary and executive bodies following the fall of the USSR, which had been recognized by Ukraine. Guess what Russia did after annexing Crimea? It declared the Tatar people’s representation an “extremist organization” and banned it.

There are obviously some issues and risks there but, especially with increased presence of western soldiers, direct Russian invasion seems extremely unlikely. Had there been no boots on the ground, no article 5 and rather just another declaration, I don’t see how that makes the situation less risky than it is now. 

I would be more inclined to agree with you if both sides didn’t actively attempt to enlarge themselves at the sake of neutral states over the last 30 years but they do. Creating an artificial zone of buffer states (again) would only put us back where we were at the start of the century. What has happened over the last 20 years would begin anew and probably turned out differently but there is no reason to believe that “this time” it would be different and neutral, non-nunclear buffer states in Eastern Europe would remain independent and left alone by all the powers at play.

Such scenario would be indicative of things if it included someone the US has promised support to. That isn’t Ukraine.

[],False,,Past-Ruin7126,,,[],,,,text,t2_hpupt50x,False,False,"&gt;This is incorrect. The Ukrainians were late to claim this attack

Would you like to share your version of the timeline? It was first mentioned officially by Odessa Governor and only hours after that, Russian MoD said that a fire caused munitions to explode. It would be suspicious if it happened the order was reversed, but this lent better credibility to the Ukrainians claim.

Russians lack credibility because they said it was 'stormy' when it sank while being towed, but it was rather normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Moskva had a myriad of onboard defences (S-300, Osa etc.) and modelling suggests that you'd need a barrage of 10-12 missiles to have a chance of piercing the onboard air defence systems. 

These models carry the assumption that the crew was ready and alert, the radar was able to detect and engage the missiles etc. What probably happened was a combination of them letting their guard down, thinking there's no AshM threat and/or distraction from allegedly TB2 drones.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If the Ukrainians are so adept with the Neptune then why haven't they been sinking Russian vessels left right and centre over the course of the campaign? Why has it taken them almost 2 months to bag a vessel?

This is a good point I thought about - but there's multiple reasons (probably some combination) that we can make educated guesses on

1. They don't have that many operational missiles/some were already destroyed.
2. They were waiting for a surprise opportunity. Once a ship was sunk, all other ships would be much more alert and the chance of sinking other ships go down. Hence you will want to target their flagship for maximum strategic value
3. They didn't use it for the first 1-2 months to give the Russians a false sense of security
4. It came into an 'optimal range/location' that made the probability of a kill high, and they took that opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for hitting the Vizar factory, that isn't proof of anything, it's a military target and they'e been hitting hundreds of targets every day.

The timing isn't coincidental. Additionally, do explain why they were withdrawing further from the coast if not for the alerted AshM threat.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Ukrainians have mobilised all reserves (totalling 900,000). All able bodied men have been prevented from leaving the country and many have been conscripted.

I think perhaps you have a misconception that mobilization = men are instantly ready to fight. Most of these reserves are not in shape, not very refreshed on combat tactics, and Ukraine most likely lack the means to even equip most of them. Most of these people largely serve at best in territorial defense role (border security, patrols etc), not very functional/useful in the Donbas fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The numerical advantage is real, do your own research and you'll see that I'm quite correct.

As I mentioned, even if they are 'conscripted', they are not anywhere near being close to being 'used' in combat. Its like how Russia has a ""million man army"", but actually only \~250k are ground forces and about 80% of their available BTGs are already dedicated to this invasion. 

I believe the burden of proof is on you since you made this claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Relative to who? The US? Ukraine has one of the most powerful militaries in Europe. They've been receiving top tier weaponry and training for at least the past 8 years and have US spec ops trainers embedded within their training academies. 

What exactly is this 'top tier weaponry' that you speak of? 

  
Artillery? Do they have HIMARS, used by Romania? Or M270 used by Germany, Finland, Italy?  
Air Force? No latest F-16s, F-18s, F-35s (already in service in multiple European countries)  
Tanks? No Leopard 2, Challenger, or M1 Abrams Tanks, which are regarded as one of the best tanks in the world.  
And of course, Ukraine navy is virtually non-existent. 

  
Missiles? Not even worth mentioning against the vast arsenal of Russia's missiles, while they only have Neptune and Tochka-U.

You're only right on the training though - the difference in doctrine is what yielded the difference in results.

Of course not, the Russians face an insurgency of an ethnically near-identical people who speaks Russian and lives right next door to them.  The Troubles will be a minor disagreement in comparison.  Russia will continue to spend blood and money trying to pacify Ukraine for years.

On the geopolitical front, Russia has alienated most Western countries and are losing some of the biggest customers of their gas and oil, not to mention all the various sanction which has been imposed on them.  This war has reinvigorated NATO and now former neutral countries like Finland and Sweden are in the process of joining them.  The Russian military has shown itself to be much weaker than expected from its reputation, so much so that client states like Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are defying them in various subtle ways.  Their BFF China is standing around wondering how much of the Russian economy they can buy up after the war is over since they're going to have enormous leverage by being one of the few major trading partners Russia will have left.

In terms of military matters on the ground, while it is true that the Russian army is advancing at a slow rate of several km per day, they're paying a heavy price in blood and metal to do so.

There is no rational reason to assume that mutually assured destruction eliminates the risk of direct conflict between NATO and Russia --- for the same reason it is wrong to have assumed the cold war would have always remained cold and it couldn't have been any other way.  

Mutually assured destruction is a theoretical abstraction, not a law of international relations on par with something like Einstein's theory of relativity.  One the one hand, it is true that every gamed-out scenario involving nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia leads to mutually assured destruction, very quickly.  But on the other, each of those scenarios involve *exchanges* as opposed to *unilateral* --- subsequently unanswered --- nuclear engagements.  

One such possible unilateral, potentially unanswered, nuclear engagement is exactly what is on the table now: Russia uses tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine and Biden does nothing in response.  Assume for the sake of argument that the Biden Administration does not engage with Russia directly even if Russia launches tactical nukes against Ukraine.  The message that sends Moscow is that Washington might not risk potential escalation even if Russia uses lower yield nukes, like tactical nuclear weapons because of perceived risk of subsequent escalation.  

Doing so is consistent with Washington's historic failures to address Russian aggression from Georgia in 2008 to present, now extrapolated to tactical nuclear weapon use.  It's hardly difficult to imagine that Putin would assume the same would apply if he used tactical nuclear weapons in other contexts, including direct conflict.  That would likely be a miscalculation on Putin's part, but we won't know until he (or a replacement) is actually confronted with the choice of whether to retaliate and how.  Almost a decade and a half of Washington's prevarication in the face of Russian aggression and incoherence in its policy towards Russia generally, has brought the world to this point.
