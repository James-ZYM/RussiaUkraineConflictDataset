Race seems to play a very important role in your views. 


&gt;When you step past just blind tribal affiliation, actually determining political belief requires critical thinking. So many people who self identify one way politically, if you actually sit down and do extensive surveys to measure their actual beliefs objectively and assess which label they'd best fit under,  you find the way people self identify, especially on the right in English speaking countries, isn't in line with what they actually believe.

Maybe you need to keep more up to date with the garbage being spewed by your overlords..

&gt; Mr Lavrov said: ""I could be wrong, but Hitler also had Jewish blood. [That Zelensky is Jewish] means absolutely nothing. Wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews.""

**slow clap**

&gt; Mariupol is the home of Azov, the nazi battalion

Ah yes, this tired trope of Russian propaganda.  Are there Nazis in Azov?  Yep.   Azov was around 900 members in 2022, with estimates of Nazi's being about 10%.   You're justifying the murder, rape, torture, the destruction of a nation because of 90 fuckin people.  This argument is beyond retarded.

Support for the far right in Ukraine is less than 1.6%.   Independent and credible polling data demonstrates that Ukraine is the MOST Jewish friendly nation of any of the slavic countries

Meanwhile, you seem to have absolutely no problem with Wagner group, which is full of Nazis. 

&gt; The Wagner Group is named after the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner, whose music Adolf Hitler adored. The group’s leader, Dmitry Utkin, reportedly wears Nazi tattoos, including a swastika, a Nazi eagle and SS lightning bolts. Wagner mercenaries are reported to have left behind neo-Nazi propaganda in the war zones where they’ve fought, including graffiti with hate symbols. 

or RIM?

&gt; Then there’s the white supremacist group known as the Russian Imperial Movement, or RIM, which the State Department designated a terrorist organization in 2020 (an effort led by one of the authors here, Nathan Sales). With the Kremlin’s tacit approval, the group operates paramilitary camps near St. Petersburg in which neo-Nazis and white supremacists from across Europe are trained in terrorist tactics. 

Or dozens of others?

&gt; As for the rape. Ukranians commit war crimes too

Link to a single case of a Ukrainian soldier raping a Russian civilian, you dishonest piece of trash.  I'll wait.  Meanwhile, Russians rape literal babies and are so proud of their achievements they post the videos to telegram.

&gt; This isn’t a one sided battle and neither side of the war is the good one.

Bullshit.  For the first time in living memory, we have a war where it is unequivocal good vs evil.

If you compare actual economic key indicators and numbers of produced equipment and numbers of reinforcements you will see that:

  1. The economic output of the Axis power (you can't look at just Germany) was individually bigger than that of the Allied forces and bigger than that of the Comintern Pact until roughly 1943/1944. It only was smaller if you add up Allied forces and Comintern Pact.
  2. The number of equipment, labour (forced labour) and valuables captured by the Axis was high enough to offset the costs of the war. The turning point was when the Wehrmacht for the first time couldn't successfully conquer enemy territory anymore. This is demonstrated in the book _Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism_.
  3. The number of German reinforcements on the eastern front was bigger than the number of Soviet reinforcements. Even up to 1944 the Wehrmacht and its allies were outnumbering the Soviets. The myth of the ""small elite fighting force against a numerically superior foe"" is created by Wehrmacht generals who have been the primary source for many decades after the war.
  4. The only real tactical advantage the Axis forces had was the earlier adoption of a successful combined arms warfare doctrine. Technologically the Axis wasn't leading but catching up except in the department of rocketry towards the end of the war.",444b58e69cc0151f0dd9f2c39c8e8497f138b6f0,True,False,,,,,0,1651506683,,0,{},i71h15f,False,t3_ugic16,False,True,t1_i708diy,/r/war/comments/ugic16/why_is_the_russian_army_doing_so_poorly/i71h15f/,1651506694,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651477883.0

I'm most proud off being Native since that and Irish are my highest percentage. Swastikas originate from Ancient Sanscret (Hinduism) you know the world's oldest religion. Anyway it was also commonly used in Native American tribes as art and because of its symbolic representation. If you look at Bhudism every sculpture has a swastika carved into the chest. I can go on and on about many many cultures using this symbol it's just unfortunate Hitler did the same, but fucked it up and altering Its main design so my swastikas look nothing you'd assume.

My concern is the way we meddle and actively promote our vision of freedom, sometimes at great cost to the people we claim to be liberating. We have a duty to our nation and to this planet to try to keep the peace, especially with Russia and China.

To me the liberation of former Soviet bloc states is not a high priority. If we can do it, great. But  if Russia will freak out and lose its shit, it isn't worth it. Many lives are at stake here.

I absolutely agree we are the good guys compared to Russia. There'a no doubt. Even with our imperialism, we at least stand for something. And while we hold all the cards in NATO, we don't run it like tyrants. We give members a voice. 

As Biden said recently, we are a good people. But we are often talked into terrible things, and we also have some incredibly scummy people too.
