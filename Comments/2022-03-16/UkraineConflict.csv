The US also has a strong vested interest in retaining access to all the high tech plants over there. This translates into a justified defensive military presence.

As a result, China's eyeing of Taiwan will likely remain just eyeing.

That being said, China's much more likely to follow the propaganda route and simply get a PRC friendly candidate elected even if it takes decades. Referendum and Taiwan is back home in the arms of Mother China.

China desires to be the primary super power in Asia. Letting Russia meltdown (but string them along) is in her best interests.

They aren’t much of a human shield if they aren’t in your possession.  The Swiss have already crossed the metaphorical line of neutrality when they approved sanctions in concert with the whole of Europe and is on Russia’s short list of enemies.

Putin is as conceded as they come but the man doesn’t seem to have a limit and if push comes to shove he knows nothing he does will save his children or even the planet from his nukes, so using them as human shields is pointless.  Sadly using their lives, well-being and sudden loss of luxury against Putin will be more effective but we have yet to reach the point where forsaking moral integrity in the name of peace is acceptable, and unfortunately the point where it becomes acceptable to the Swiss will already be too late for everyone else.  If we do reach that point and it’s a real possibility, everyone should expect the Swiss to capitulate and negotiate before taking any actions, even if the missiles have already launched.

The only reason the Swiss have taken any action against Russia thus far, is because of Russia’s blatant disregard for the Geneva Convention, the rules of war and the fact that there is a money trail linking Swiss banks to Russian Oligarchs a mile long.

,[],False,,Lvtxyz,,,[],,,,text,t2_ef8bhkxe,False,True,"Trump stopped Putin in Syria?  I am very interested to know where you get your information because it is all incorrect. Please send me links (no videos). 

Trump served Syria up on a silver platter to Putin. He pulled out and left our decades-long allies (the Kurds) hanging with no warning and no transition plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't know how many times I can lay this out.

""Putin didn't invade Ukraine from 2016-2020 and instead invaded in 2022 (over a year after Biden took office).  \*Therefore\* it was because x."" You can put anything you like in x.  Maybe he was tracking the price of ammo. Maybe he was shoring up an alliance with China (they agreed China would buy Russia wheat only *days* before the invasion), maybe he wanted to finish mopping up Syria after the Trump pull out in 2019.  Maybe Bolton is right and he was waiting for Trump 2.0 to follow through on leaving NATO.""  You are creating a narrative not supported by the evidence whatsoever.  

Meanwhile you ignore 5 glaring data points that all point to Putin *wanting* Trump in office.  

Here is another possible interpretation of not invading under Trump:  Putin has a puppet in Trump.  Putin thought he was going to win quickly. Which would damage Biden's reputation while everyone said, ""Biden is weak!!""  If we damage Biden presidency, what is in it for Putin?  Positions Trump to retake the WH in 2024.  This theory is more plausible than ""Putin fears trump!"" given the many, many other data points we have. 

Here is where DJT Jr tweets out the email exchange showing that Russia is trying to help him: [https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789839522140166](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789839522140166) 

Here is showing RNC was also hacked but not released. I'm sure you know DNC was released. [https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/12/10/report-russian-hackers-had-rnc-data-but-didn-t-release-it](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/12/10/report-russian-hackers-had-rnc-data-but-didn-t-release-it) 

DJT has many tweets in which he states ""no collusion!"" but doesn't state ""Russia didn't want me to win.""  Essentially admitting that Putin wanted Trump as President. **Again, I ask why? Why would Putin want Trump as president if he fears him?**  “Senate Intelligence Panel found absolutely no evidence of collusion. There was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence 2016, affirming the findings of other investigations.” Daily Caller"" - Trump Tweet, August 2020 but there are MANY in which he is essentially arguing ""they helped me but I didn't work with them directly."" 

Now that is just what DJT Jr and DJT admit. However, since politicians lie, let's turn to the Mueller Report which is written by a veteran and republican and states 

\- Russian interference in the 2016 election was “sweeping and systemic.”\[1\]  


\- Major attack avenues included a social media “information warfare” campaign that “favored” candidate Trump\[2\] and the hacking of Clinton campaign-related databases and release of stolen materials through Russian-created entities and Wikileaks.\[3\]

  
\-  Russia also targeted databases in many states related to administering elections gaining access to information for millions of registered voters.\[4\]

Ask yourself. If you love America can you really let Putin dictate who are next President is? And why is he hell bent on Trump??",4cd37e6558c55bf68a1aae5d5441074c5da759a8,True,False,,,,,0,1647394852,,0,{},i0twks0,False,t3_tel1l6,False,True,t1_i0sjlim,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tel1l6/watch_we_gave_away_our_nukes_for_your_guarantee/i0twks0/,1647394868,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647366052.0,,,,

&gt; According to a Ukrainian diplomat speaking on the Daily Beast&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;The New Abnormal&amp;quot; podcast, Russian President Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine has multiple problems hampering his attempt to take over the country and now it is being compounded by soldiers refusing to take part in the war against their neighbors.

&gt; Claiming that young soldiers who have entered the country are &amp;quot;Extremely demotivated&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;I think, pretty much, everybody outside of his very closed circle around Putin knows that this campaign is going down the drain... We have received reports that soldiers from Crimea are refusing to be deployed to Odessa, to fight for Odessa. They see the warships approach the coast and suddenly stop and turned away.""

&gt; He added, &amp;quot;The [Ukrainian] soldiers are ready to fight until the last drop of blood here and Russian soldiers increasingly are clueless about what they&amp;#039;re doing here.""

That took many resources to load and then later unload those and verify they are ready for combat, 'just in case'.

Moving 5 or 10 as a show of force, sure, but I counted about 30 in that video.

I do not know for sure what the plan is, but I am going to take a swag that they are going to be used by someone over there on a real mission.

For a professional military it would not take long to come up to speed on those.  A couple of days of practice and they would be good enough to be effective.

Besides, who is to say that they have not already received training?  A crew of 3 per vehicle for 30 vehicles is only about 100 troops.

The fire control systems in those things are all electronic with thermal vision and great optics for zooming and easy to learn - look at screen, put reticle on target, push button, repeat on next target.  It is like playing a video game.

Whether or not they have personnel to service them is another story though.

Casualty lists usually divide up into dead, injured and missing. Missing here refers to captured and deserted men, though the military very much doesn't want to admit that desertion might be common. Looking at WWII numbers the ratio of death to injury varies from 1:0.5 for china (lots of murder going on there) to 1:1.5 for Germany with combatants who had good statistics (like the US and UK) both having 1:1 ratios. Sovet numbers are somewhere between 1:2 and 1:1.5. 

10,000 dead means somewhere between 5,000 and 20,000 injured, the 1:1 number is likely a good estimation as long as the Russian army medical and logistics remain open, if they don't expect many of the wounded to die.

The world saw this and joined in the spirit of protecting the freedom, human rights and democracy of Ukraine. The economic sanctions placed on Russia are impeding the economical progress and causing their country's economy to fall.  They've lost decades of progress and hundreds of billions of US dollars frozen. After the first week, we found documents on a war ship showing a 15 day timeline.  Russia has now gotten the attention of all the world.  The world has been rallied to Ukraine's side, by standing firm for the core values we all live by, and by courageously fighting back against the terroristic Russian factions piling up on their borders.  Russian media has loaded its country with propaganda that promotes lies about the war, giving false claims about their reason for invading.  All claims Russia has made regarding their plan, timeline, and progress, falls short of the truth of what has happened. Now Russia is struggling.  Why would Russia even consider asking for help?  Even if Ukraine is getting free help, they only wanted peace.  Ukrainian cause is justified and makes a fair fight.  Who would not fight for the freedom and independence for Ukraine. The Good Russian people here in the US are embarrassed of their former countries leader, Putin...  Despite what is said in Russian propaganda, Putin and the rest of the arrogant Russian fools have failed, left uncertain, upset, and losing.  Just because Russia doesn't disappear, does not mean they are winning.  Lets face it, even if Russian military keeps sending troops, they will continue to drain their military and resources.  The whole free world will stand for Ukraine.  The free world won't believe the propaganda of the arrogant fools making false claims.  They will pay for their lack of concern for humanity.  They will pay for their crafted lies and crafting accusations by using the psychological defense mechanism of Projection against Ukraine and US.  Accusing Ukraine of Nazism, while they themselves are the Nazis.  Everything they accuse of, they are guilty of.    
 Their own neighbors, they treat like this.  The world will not let Ukraine lose its sovereignty, God willing, Putin will fail.  We stand with Ukraine in the USA. We have some idiots here like ""Tucker Carlson"" who are sharply criticizing our government and president publicly, taking advantage of our Free speech to promote a government that is against freedom.  Tucker Carlson is a Fox news fool, who is making our government look weak to the Russian aggressors.  This kind of treasonous fools are flaming the propaganda in Russia and helping to make Russia appear justified in their war against peace.  God willing, Tucker Carlson will also see justice for giving a foothold to the Russian Kremlin false media.  I think we should be able to force Tucker Carlson out of this country, to be sent to Russia to become a Russian citizen.  Then He will appreciate the freedom He once had.  Anyone who is Pro-Putin, or makes Pro Putin comments, should be arrested, forced to take a treason test.  A fine should be paid and a part of the money should be sent to help re-build Ukraines infrastructure.  In extreme cases, if treasonous responses are found, these people should be sent to Russia and have their US Citizenship revoked, for promoting terrorist organization amidst a humanitarian crisis should be punishable by deportation and U.S. citizenship removed.  I'm just trying to be fair.

Here an translated excerpt from a recent interview with French military expert Pierre Servant:

SPIEGEL: You have experienced many wars. What is happening in Ukraine right now, what stage is the war in?

Servent: For the Ukrainians who are being bombed, the situation will remain terrible for a long time. What is particularly remarkable for me, however, is the chaos on the Russian side. The Russian army demonstrates great destructive power and at the same time great vulnerability. They have air supremacy thanks to modern equipment. But they are unable to occupy Ukraine. That is becoming increasingly clear. Because the ground forces are weak. A country of this size, with a population of 42 million, cannot be conquered with 190,000 soldiers. 40,000 of them are just logisticians - and the Russian army is bad at logistics. It speaks to a certain desperation of the Russian President should Vladimir Putin, as reported, use Chechen henchmen or militias of his Syrian friend Bashar al-Assad, the greatest war criminal of all.

,[],False,,PrinceWith999Enemies,,,[],,,,text,t2_4j3td3kn,False,True,"That’s the thing - this is very much a war for funsies. This is a war for conquest - for political and territorial power - and it was sold as a walk in the park. They thought it would be like when Hitler took over the Sudetenland, or if you prefer, when Putin took Crimea. 

If you’re fighting a war for your survival, then a negotiated peace that includes your survival, in whatever diminished capacity, might make sense. Russia is fighting for money and power, and to position itself for further conflicts in Europe. If it starts to cost more than they could possibly win, it becomes a losing proposition. Russia isn’t really threatened by NATO. There weren’t really Ukrainians looking to be liberated from a Jewish Nazi dictator.  

The reasons why the NK/Cuba (or older Soviet) comparisons may not apply when it comes to the Russian will to fight are twofold. First, the economic sanctions are severely reducing Russian quality of life. Going from 100 to 10 is a whole different story than going from 20 to 10. NK, Cuba, and the USSR were used to lower quality of life. Starbucks and Microsoft pulling out of NK isn’t a big deal. It is for Russians. Second is the people with actual power in Russia - the oligarchs - are affects strongly by this. That’s Putin’s base of power, and they support him because he makes them rich beyond the dreams of avarice. If he makes them poor, they’re going to pull their support. 

The announced basis for the war (NATO threat and Nazis) were lies. That’s becoming increasingly obvious, even in Russia. The actual argument for war - it would be an easy power grab that Ukraine wouldn’t resist and the West would permit - turns out to be an error. It’s no longer financially viable. All that’s left is assuaging Putin’s ego with Russian blood and treasure, and the open question is to how long Russia is willing to let that go on.",6c53090c5a0e513d6e979aa1b754c98fa5bd9d19,True,False,,,,,0,1647458181,,0,{},i0x6mgj,False,t3_tfbrnv,False,True,t1_i0wca5r,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tfbrnv/kremlin_in_unexpected_uturn_after_yet_another/i0x6mgj/,1647458194,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647429381.0,,,,

This is the accidental victory essay published by Russian state media:

https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html

Do you speak Russian? Tell me what it says. 

Here I'll translate a special part for you.

&gt;Владимир Путин взял на себя — без капли преувеличения — историческую ответственность, решив не оставлять решение украинского вопроса будущим поколениям. Ведь необходимость его решения всегда оставалась бы главной проблемой для России — по двум ключевым причинам. И вопрос национальной безопасности, то есть создания из Украины анти-России и форпоста для давления на нас Запада, это лишь вторая по значимости среди них.

(bold my emphasis)

&gt;**Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of **anti-Russia from Ukraine** and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.

Its about the ERASURE OF UKRAINE COMPLETELY AS A NATION, and the UKRAINIAN IDENTITY AS AN ANTI-RUSSIA like the anti christ to Russian existence. 

ITS ABOUT THE GENOCIDE OF UKRAINE. Its about PUTIN WANTING TO RETURN TO THE USSR and turn Ukraine into LITTLE RUSSIA.

This is THEIR OWN WORDS.

Stop fucking lying you fucking shill.
