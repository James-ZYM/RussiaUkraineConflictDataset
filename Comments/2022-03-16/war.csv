Of course, there are those who decided to get corrupted as well on our side.  


The only reason Putin decided to invade is that he saw a pro-EU shift in our gov. We overthrew Yanukovich, who was Putin's pawn (just like Lukashenko in Belarus). Before that, we had Yuschenko who was poisoned by KGB for making a referendum to join NATO. Poroshenko, (previous president before Zelensky) also made a lot of mistakes but can you blame a guy who became a president of the invaded, half-destroyed country?  


They are not ideal. But there's no such thing as an ideal gov. We as Ukrainians are trying our best to maintain order in our politics and we pay in blood for that. There's no other way around it.

What is that difference? They are at least for now rational actors. There are reasons based on fact of why they do the things they do, they are not always good reasons, often they are selfish reasons they are even sometimes based on lies. Mostly they boil down to economic or resource or market or political control. 

However under this competition we have built an extremely complex global supply chain. And have improved global collaboration. And most people in the world have benefited from the peace(my chart that you scoff at).  Yes there are tragedies and atrocities but let’s not forget that there are huge benefits and not only for people that live in the US for the world as a whole.

Do you live in US? If you do you directly benefit from all the evil US does, you may not like it but that’s why you get to vote. If the leaders start acting too crazy the institution is still strong enough to prevent them from doing irreparable damage. I don’t lose sleep at night thinking that Biden will do a preemptive nuclear strike.

Now let’s look at Russia. Putin had an ideology of united Russian people and he viewed resources in Ukraine as crucial.. on the face this is similar to wars us/nato ran in the Middle East. However his success is based on the idea that all Russian speaking people want to be with Russia. 

I guarantee if Putin took Kyiv in 3 days, like they planned, and had broad support in UA population, like he expected, after some grumbling and limited sanctions everyone would have looked away. This happened to Crimea, to Georgia etc. 

That would have been evil but it would have been a rational war and in time it would have increased Russias power. Russian opposition to nato was also more or less rational.

The war that is happening now is no longer rational. 

1) After sanctions It does not contribute to the wellbeing of the Russian citizens.
2) Most of the premises of the war are false 
3) the war is already lost because none of the objectives can be reasonably achieved 

So we have one guy murdering civilians and his own soldiers by thousands in order to stay in power, while blackmailing the world with nuclear holocaust. 

This war is a murder suicide of two nations committed on behalf of one man. 

Finally this war has an extremely destabilising effect on the world, much more so than any of the wars in the last 20 years.  The world is not in a good place we need to come together to solve major issues. With this war it may be impossible. Humanity is much more interdependent than we realise. This war may push billions into poverty, famine, death.

I don’t have good solutions on how to deal with Putin, but I know that all possible help must be given, if Ukraine is lost I think the threat of WWIII will go up and not down.",9064ea2d3f771053a420036dcc1c0a4831069f6b,True,False,,,,,0,1647412906,,0,{},i0ut4h1,False,t3_teqd5u,False,True,t1_i0tqhdi,/r/war/comments/teqd5u/well_this_happened/i0ut4h1/,1647412925,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647384106.0,

385,[],False,,malimete,,,[],,,,text,t2_14lpcd,False,False,"I didn't know that like I said before idk much about India-Pakistan. The only thing i know is that i dislike both countries for a few reasons.

The West has done similar things before no news there. Remember how the British wanted to control the Suez again and allied with Israel ? That turned out well for the British. Credit to the Americans if I'm not mistaken they actually stood up against the British so credit where credit is due (again if i remember correctly i might be wrong on that)

I don't think Russia protected India because they wanted to protect a democracy. Russia was communist back in the 70s and India were buying their equipment. I think they saw an opportunity to sell more equipment and be a bit friendlier with one of their close neighbours which means theyll probably buy even more of your equipment in the future. This would force India into thinking that the West cannot be trusted and Russia is their only ally so NATO would lose a potential member which is good for Russia. Again idk a whole lot about the situation there so i can't say anything. But i really don't think they protected India because of any good will or anything.

And preferring a nuclear war to NATO getting more members ? Why do you think countries wanna join NATO ? Protection against the Russians. Modern and good military equipment. Being able to say ""you mess with us ? We got a nuclear power behind us you really don't want to do that."" Hating NATO is one thing i understand that and at some points i even agree with you but preferring a nuclear war ? Preferring to see Europe in ruins ? I hate the Europeans too but i wouldn't want them to get nuked. That would be a disaster both for them and for us. You realize that once the nukes fly there is no going back right ? We are all dead at that point doesn't matter if you liked NATO, hated NATO, hated EU it does not matter cuz there is not a single place in the entire planet that could save you.

We both hate NATO but the reasons as to why we hate NATO and what we prefer etc are WILDLY different. I hate NATO because they backstabbed us many times and i don't believe thats how an ally should act. I prefer a Turkic alliance but that is impossible. We are far away from our Turkic brothers, we would not be strong enough to stand up to possible aggressors like Russia and most of our people don't seem to want it in the first place. So we stay in NATO not because we like it but because we have no other options. You seem to hate NATO because of the many stupid, wrong and useless things they've done in the past. You think they are colonizing the world which i believe is wrong. Again countries wanna join NATO for a reason mainly protection from Russia. You can't blame NATO for colonizing when the people ""colonized"" weren't forced to enter NATO they did it willingly that isn't colonization. And most importantly preferring a nuclear war to NATO gaining a few members ? It just doesn't make sense, doesn't hold up. A nuclear war could and i believe 100% would end our race, our civilization.

It's extremely hard to predict the outcome of a complicated situation where large numbers of people are involved, you have an opponent that does its best to defeat you, and significant effort is made to obfuscate one's capabilities and plans. Wargames are one of the available tools to somewhat reduce uncertainty. They are far from perfect but that doesn't mean they are useless. An actual error is not using wargames, but overestimating how much uncertainty there is even after all the traditional military tools including warfgames - some people are bad at handling uncertainty and need to feel that they have everything covered after they used all their tools - even if it means if ignoring any remaining questions.

To make an analogy, imagine a new disease with 60% mortality. Someone quickly discovers that using a combination of existing treatments can cut mortality to 40%.

And yes NATO is big thanks to all the smaller nations in it but those are really small nations without huge militaries. Those nations don't really matter military wise.

As for war crimes and human right violations it isn't only NATO responsible for these but the whole world. The government's are responsible for giving the orders, the soldiers are responsible for executing the orders, the population is responsible for either supporting or not doing anything to stop these things from happening, the allied nations are responsible for not stopping it and the whole world is responsible for not doing anything about it. I mean look at Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq it's everyone's fault. For either being a part of this entire mess or for not standing up against it. We can't just blame NATO (Even tho they are at fault) we have to blame everyone. Those that took part in it and those that watched it happening.

I am worried about NATO not because I'm afraid they are colonizing the world but because they are supposed to be our allies but they've been always getting in our way. That is what worries me. These people are not our allies if they don't help us and help our enemies. I don't believe they are trying to fully colonize the world. And if they did, if I had no other choice if i had to choose between being colonized by the West or by the East I'd choose the West. Both sides suck but Western nations are more free with a higher quality of life.

As for Putin i don't think bombing civilians in Ukraine is him standing up to NATO. However NATO is absolutely at fault here mainly because of what i said earlier. We have to blame both the people doing a war crime and the people watching it happen. NATO to give them some credit has been supplying weapons to Ukraine but it's too late and nowhere near enough to stop the Russians. Russia will do what Russia does throw more men into the meat grinder until the enemy disappears. Russia should be blamed for this invasion and NATO should be blamed for not predicting this even tho every single event showed us a war could happen and not helping the Ukrainians sooner.

NATO is here to stay like it or not. They are too big and we all know how the ""big, strong, modern and civilized"" Europeans are like. They will protect themselves while alienating those they see as weird and hostile. The only reason I wish to leave NATO is because our allies don't really act like allies to us. I, just like everyone else, hold my own nations interests and future above any other nations interest and future and i believe that if Turkey is to have a good future we need to leave the Islamic world behind and leave NATO behind too. The ""modern and civilized"" West does not want us. Our ""Muslim brothers"" have done more harm to us than anything else. People see us as the face of the Middle East, the face of Islam. We must change that. We should be allies with our Turkic brothers, an alliance of our own. We should be the face of the Turkic people and the Turkic religion of Tengrism. Not Islam, not Middle East. 

Unfortunately I don't think that's possible. My people for some reason don't talk about this idea. No one does. It's sad. But i can't blame them. West has a higher quality of life than anywhere else in the world (except for a few Eastern nations like Japan) Western nations are much more free and rich then anyone else in the world and they are much more stronger military wise too. I understand why people want to be a part of the West. If we ended up doing what i said you know creating an alliance with the other Turkic nations I feel like we would not be strong not even strong enough to defend ourselves. We would be food to our bigger neighbours. We need strong allies preferably allies with nukes behind us to act as a deterrent to anyone who would want to attack us. The only alliance that provides this safety is NATO. We simply don't have any better choices.

I hate both the West and the East. I don't agree with what Putin is doing and i don't think NATO is trying to colonize and conquer the entire planet. I wish we could be better allies with our Turkic friends but we wouldn't be strong enough to defend ourselves, we'd be food to nations like Russia. We are in NATO not because these people are good allies but because every other option we have ends with us losing our nation to some foreign invader. And like i said i don't believe NATO is trying to conquer the planet and colonize everyone or anything no i think that's more of a conspiracy theory than anything else BUT if it was real and NATO was really trying to colonize everyone then I'd rather be colonized by them rather then being colonized by idk Russia, China or anyone from the East. Eastern nations and the people over there are not free. They are not as rich or powerful as the West. Their quality of life is lower then the West's. Why would anyone choose nations like China and Russia ? We are not choosing between good and evil but choosing between awful and less awful. I believe the East fits into the awful category while the West fits into the less awful category so of course I'm choosing the lesser evil between the two options.",5ac7a315a27670a94468e8987793a7a63e1cbed6,True,False,,,,,0,1647393732,,0,{},i0tu04u,False,t3_teqd5u,False,True,t1_i0t9um4,/r/war/comments/teqd5u/well_this_happened/i0tu04u/,1647393745,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647364932.0,

""Nations that engage in war are rightfully criticised and punished by the global community."" 

Nobody was punished for Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, or any other hot war or proxy war for that matter. 

And we've been competing over economics and science forever. Where the hell did you think the nukes came from in the first place? 

Humans don't really innovate in the sense of that word. We create better ways to kill ourselves. We create better bombs, bullets, knives, and armor. When the top soil is eroded from bad farming practices we synthesize fertilizers and pesticides that poison us because we never listen to the natives when they told us to rotate crop fields. 

Science will only take one so far, as a nation needs ethics for it to help humanity. As a computer scientist I can tell you standards from Lockheed Martin that date back decades are still used in the field to this day. You wanna guess what that system was used create?

Or what about operation paperclip? I mean Nazis are bad, but it's OK when they make you rockets, right?

In the end i don't know much about the conflict between them so i can't say anything all i can say is I'm not huge fans of either of these countries.

But China ? I fucking hate China. I'm Turkish we have Turkic ancestry and these Chinese mother fuckers are killing my Uyghur brothers. I hate it. We've been enemies with them ever since we, the Turks, used to live in Central Asia and to this day i consider ourselves to be still enemies. There is only a single event in which i support China. The Western nations used to do a lot of colonization (something they still do to this day.) That's how they got so powerful in the first place just used every other part of this world for their own benefit, never giving a fuck about the people living in these parts of the world. Now China is trying to do the same thing colonizing and all that and the Western nations are against it. Why ? You did the exact same thing before and it is something you still do ? Why isn't other nations allowed to do what you have done previously ? i hate China but in this single situation I will support them.

I don't think NATO is a threat to world peace. The big nations inside of NATO like USA are a threat to world peace. Smaller nations inside of NATO are there only for protection and i don't blame them for that. However i do blame ALL of NATO for backstabbing us time and time again. It's not NATO that's the problem. It's the big nations inside of NATO and the fact that NATO and just the Western World in general always alienates us. Because we are Turkish ? Because of our history with the Ottoman Empire ? Because Turkey is a majority Islam nation ? Because we own İstanbul the West's really precious city ? Because we are in the Middle East/Asia ? There is a lot of reasons and i don't care at this point. If NATO wants to keep alienating us then so be it.

667,[],False,,JoshPigeonfeather,,,[],,,,text,t2_8j85prr0,False,False,"In the movie ""Dr. Strangelove"" based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert""   
(1958). A United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper has   
gone mad and commands a group of nuclear bomb carrying bombers to attack  
 targets in the Soviet Union in the hope that all US nuclear forces will  
 launch an all out attack in order to avert being wiped out by the   
inevitable retaliatory strike his attack will elicit. He tells his   
underlings ""Yes gentlemen, they are on their way in and no one can bring  
 them back. For the sake of our country and our way of life, I suggest   
you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise we will be totally   
destroyed by red retaliation. My boys will give you the best kind of   
start, fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell won't stop   
them now. So let's get going.There's no other choice. God willing, we   
will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through   
the purity and essence of our natural fluids. God bless you all.  
""The referenced to ""natural fluids"" is the general's paranoid belief   
that fluoride in municipal water supplies is a Soviet plot to pollute   
the ""precious bodily fluids"" of Americans. What follows is mostly scenes  
 inside a command center with top US military and government figures   
along with the president of the US. The other scenes are mostly onboard   
the one US bomber that has survived Soviet and US attempts to shoot all   
bombers in their group down so they don' set off WW III. The plot ends   
badly with the one surviving bomber bombing the Soviet's""Doomsday   
Machine"", which is meant to set off some kind of nuclear scenario which   
will end all life on earth so that if the Soviet Union is bombed into   
nonexistence, at least they'll take the rest of the world with them.  
The conversation in the war room is turned to options for surviving   
the nuclear war by wheelchair-bound, presidential scientific advisor, a   
former German Nazi Dr. Strangelove. The Doctor suggests that a small of   
elites (including of course his self and all present in the war room)   
could survive the radiation fallout in shelter built into a salt mine.   
He goes on to insist this redoubt be populated with a1 0:1   
female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once  
 the radiation has subsided, with the females being ""of exceptional   
sexual nature.""  
Are there parallels between this plot and the current kerfuffle   
coming out of Russia today. Is Putin General Ripper? Is Putin's military  
 venture to retake a reluctant (to say the least) Ukraine back into   
Putin's proposed reconstituted Soviet Union meant to elicit direct   
combat between Russian and NATO forces,eventually leading to nuclear war  
 between the two nuclear superpowers?  
Putin is cited by several well established journalists to be   
collecting a harem of women who he has impregnated and set up living in   
exceptionally desirable locations with a lavish trust fund to guarantee   
their survival (and probably to keep their mouth shut).  
Putin has had constructed a massive palace on the Black Sea coast.   
One source states that ""Putin’s Palace has 16-storey underground   
bunker"". Add to this the fact that many of the the Oligarchs supporting   
the Putin regime have taken residence on massive cities on cruise ship   
hulls which could take refuge in harbors with less radiation exposure.   
\*1  
""Putin has moved his family to secret Siberian nuclear bunker, expert  
 claims"" is title of a story in the March 1, 2022 UK Mirror news site.   
\*2  
Is Putin trying to set off WW III, where he and his Oligarchs (maybe)  
 might luxuriate in a 16 story underground bunker stocked with women of   
exceptional sexual nature, with only the job of keeping them perpetually  
 impregnated to occupy their time?  
After all, Chernobyl didn't go so badly did it? There's hunting for   
boar there now and farmers nearby are growing potatoes and probably   
engaging in the Russian sport of remaining drunk on vodka made from them  
 for as much time as possible.   
Vlad and his clan can roam the depopulated planet and live the life, with no one to tell him what to do.  
More room for Vlad and more for his clan.

I've been seeing people telling me i don't belong in NATO and now they just say ""go get em tiger"" because our drones did good work in Ukraine and we can close the straits to Russia. When the war ends the West will go back to alienating us.
