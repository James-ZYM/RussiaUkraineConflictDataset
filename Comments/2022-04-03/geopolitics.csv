For starters, radioactive fallout is not limited to the target of the attack. Using nukes in Ukraine, even small ones, could cause fallout in other parts of Europe, including Russia itself. This invites retaliation from foreign nations, and can cause panic and chaos at home.

It also breaks an unspoken international law: do not use nuclear weapons. One of the reasons no one has used nuclear weapons in warfare is because nations would prefer that no one ever uses them. Once a nation starts using them as a normal means of warfare, others can and will follow suit. Most assuredly, a Russia nuclear use in Ukraine would involve a kinetic response from the West, even if it was only conventional in nature. 

Nuclear deterrence has been a major factor in preventing a third world war, but once a nation proves itself as willing to use such weapons anyways, other nuclear powers are forced to confront or retreat from the situation.

On one hand, I think the russians hoped to seize control of Kyiv in first few days, maybe with a coup (I remember the russians asking the ukrainian army to depose Zelensky the first day); otherwise the paratroopers sent to die in Hostomel would have been unexplainable.

On the other hand, I don't believe they ever wanted to capture Kyiv after the coup failed in the first few days. It's a much larger city than Mariupol and look at how that battle is going. They would have needed a lot more manpower. Also, it's a highly symbolical city, I doubt the russians would have any interest in razing it to ground (I hope I'm right). Since the first few days, the main direction of the russian advance was Mariupol, to connect Crimea and Donbass and then try to surround the bulk of the ukrainian forces in the east. 

Many say that they shifted their initial objective to a minor one - Donbass - but to me Donbass always seemed to be their main objective. This is also the explanation given by the russians, but to be honest it makes a lot more sense than thinking that they wanted to capture Kyiv in an urban battle. The idea, according to the russians, was to keep pressure on Kyiv to force a part of the Ukrainian military to defend it in a mutual bleeding out. It's also the same logic that they with Odessa, by constantly feinting a landing operation. Again, it makes sense, but the losses (even if you do the average with the ukrainians' and the russians' estimate) seem to have been high in the North East. We don't know about Ukrainian losses, tho.

The russians themselves said that they were retreating from Kyiv to help the negotiations (an obvious excuse) but they also announced that the second phase of their ""operation"" would have been the conquest of Donbass and that the war wasn't over. They are obviously regrouping for that. I don't know why we are acting so surprised for something they themselves announced. Something is obviously going to happen in Donbass and the conquest of Mariupol and the bombing of refineries is preliminary to that.

Now, to what extent it was about preventing war vs delaying it I'm not sure, but the West views not much having being gained from delaying the war.

In this case the term appeasement is being applied to refer to the demands Russia is making upon Ukraine and the West more broadly, ""Give me what I want or I will continue to cause damage.""  It's not 100% because there are negotiations around ending the conflict which are more even now that Russia has failed to effectively win this quickly.

The West is reluctant to negotiate evenly because they don't expect Putin to ""go away"" like Hitler didn't ""go away"", which is where the appeasement comes in.  If in your view Putin is a hostile actor whom you can't bargain down in the long term then giving in in the short term empowers him to strike later.

In this context ""appeasement"" is is short handing for a weak negotiating position and outcome (that Chamberlain was seen to be in, and that acceding territory would seem to be here).

[],False,,Affectionate_Cat293,,,[],,,,text,t2_bywstnsf,False,False,"I think you confuse liberalism with assimilation policy or even outright (cultural) genocide. Liberalism does focus on the individual, it assumes that every individual is entitled to live their life as they see fit. It does not mean that there is no space for group rights. It also does not imply that all different groups must be eliminated. In the main article posted in this thread, Fukuyama clearly clarified in the beginning that ""\[t\]he fundamentals of liberal societies are tolerance of difference, respect for individual rights, and the rule of law."" You cannot tolerate difference if you prohibit a group from speaking their language or if you force native people to ""become like us"". The paper about France you cited does not mention anything about ""French view of liberalism"".

I would say that the ""end results"" you mentioned are the consequence of assimilation policy, which is usually linked to nationalism. Stephen May argued in his book, ""Language and Minority Rights: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Politics of Language"" (https://www.routledge.com/Language-and-Minority-Rights-Ethnicity-Nationalism-and-the-Politics-of/May/p/book/9780805863062): ""He argues that the causes of many of the language-based conflicts in the world today still lie with the nation-state and its preoccupation with establishing a 'common' language and culture via mass education. The solution, he suggests, is to rethink nation-states in more culturally and linguistically plural ways while avoiding, at the same time, essentializing the language-identity link.""

The following dissertation (https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1510021/FULLTEXT01.pdf) also observes:

""Even though some forms of nationalism may be more inclusive than others to  
minorities, what nation-states have in common is that one core nation typically dominates politically over groups that form smaller minorities without significant  
political or territorial power within the state. The national, or non-national, ‘others’,  
with cultures or languages that differ from the core nation(s), nevertheless challenge  
the aspirations of majority nation-building. Triandafyllidou highlights how the  
presence of minorities within national borders “disrupts the cultural and political  
order of the nation, and thus challenges its sense of unity and authenticity” (1998,  
603). Many states have aimed to create such unity by political means through  
language policy, history and civic education, and by regulating who has the right to  
settle within it. At the centre of such governance we find politics targeting different  
minorities who are perceived to be deviant with regard to the national core.""

In the case of France, the decline of regional languages started when France forced students to only speak French at the expense of Breton, Occitan, etc:

""The Compulsory Education Law of 1882 was adopted in a  
time when the 3rd Republic aimed to unify the country through  
French language. In schools, teaching practices resulted in the  
prohibition of the use of minority languages, and thus installing  
shame in children’s minds of their own mother tongue and of  
their own culture. Those practices lasted up to the 1960s. In  
1925, the French Minister of Education Anatole de Monzie,  
declared: ‘For the linguistic unity of France, the Breton language  
must disappear’. In 1972, Mr Georges Pompidou, President of  
France, stated that there was no place for regional languages  
in France. These policies and attitudes are reflected in various legislative measures that have restricted and diminished Breton  
language use to the extent that the French state has been  
criticized for conducting a campaign aimed at eradicating Breton.""

Tsakonia, which is the only living descendant of Doric Greek (the language of the Sparta), is also now in danger of extinction. This can be attributed to the policy of the Greek government in the past to prohibit the use of this language in schools; teachers would even punish students who were caught speaking Tsakonian (http://www.tsakoniandialect.info/engintro.html).

Within liberalism itself, there is a body of literature on ""liberal multiculturalism"", which influences the works of international organisations (source: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1510021/FULLTEXT01.pdf):

""**The large body of scholarship on liberal multiculturalism maintains that multiculturalism and multilingualism accommodations are to be strived for in multinational contexts for reasons of justice** (Kymlicka 1995; 2007; Patten 2016; May 2012; De Schutter 2007). Liberal multiculturalist researchers hold that practicing neutrality in matters of culture and language would lead to the promotion of the majority culture and language through state institutions and thereby indirectly cause an unjust assimilation that harms the dignity of national minorities. The normative starting points of liberal multiculturalism can be viewed in contrast to research within political philosophy where a neutrality towards, or assimilation of, minority identities is seen as a path towards a just or equal society (Barry 2001; Pogge 2003; Laitin and Reich 2003). Within research on liberal multiculturalism, possibly the most influential, widely used, and often contested, theory of minority rights has been written by Kymlicka. As he states in relation to the direct policy influence of his theories, “I have been struck by the way \[the ideal of liberal multiculturalism\] has come to inform the work of many international organizations”. He further describes how the concepts, facilitated by IOs, have reached countries such as Syria and Moldova (Kymlicka 2007, 7). The ideas, which have been treated as near-universal theoretical tools (Modood, Triandafyllidou, and Zapata-Barrero 2006, 4-7), have thereby shaped not only academic thoughts central for this dissertation, but also the minority and integration policies that are its subject of scrutiny.""",21c3c0ef3b5e8715e4022f845bd2f3390115ab7f,True,False,,,,,0,1648974609,,0,{},i37a6ja,False,t3_ttqahr,False,True,t1_i375i00,/r/geopolitics/comments/ttqahr/francis_fukuyama_liberalism_needs_the_nation/i37a6ja/,1648974626,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648945809.0

My understanding of liberalism is that its focuses on the individual.  There is no guarantee for group rights in the US Constitution or those most Western countries, those group rights are usually an add-on.   

You can have all the individual rights in the world, but it can't reverse the linguistic genocide of native American populations. The Bill of Rights doesn't guarantee that teachers are hired to revive those languages.

In the USSR and China linguistic minorities had state-funded schools to teach their own languages. In China until the 1980s, most people were taught in minority languages/dialects. Cantonese people were taught in Cantonese etc.  The majority of Chinese people prior to the 1990s couldn't speak Mandarin or spoke it very poorly. 

The author correctly tries to sidestep this issue, because it is a thorny issue.

You can take until your face turns blue about liberalism and how great liberal democracies are, but people look at the results

If the UN passed sanctions against Russia, India will adhere to them. However, the current unilateral sanctions by the ""west"" will not. Unlike China, India has settled martime, trade, etc disputes under the international order.

If nuclear weapons are banned across all countries, India will support it. However, if the world is divided into a hierarchy, it won't. 

If US can't learn to become part of the international order it will eventually lead to a schism between US and India. 

Examples are - US sanctions on Cuba. US protecting Israel, US interference in Libya which is in turmoil. US wars in south America, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc. Occupation of islands in Indian Ocean from natives, etc. 

It's worth noting that US almost went to war with USSR over nuclear missiles being deployed in Cuba. Guess which countries compromised back then, Cuba and USSR. Just know, US foreign policy justifies overthrowing, invading, and destroying a country for much much less than what Russia's demanded from Ukraine was.
