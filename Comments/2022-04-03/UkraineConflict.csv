The trails lead to field commanders and their staffs, tactical commanders and their staffs, the overall operational commander and his staff, the Kremlin and its siloviki and ultimately to the architect and director of this war, Putin.

These events are widespread and systemic. That indicates not just individual responsibility but command responsibility. Either the operational command is being negligent in controlling its troops, or it is directing them to commit these atrocities, either way both neglect and intent are indictable as war crimes and crimes against humanity.

But the trail goes higher than the operational command. Complaints have been made by the UN and it’s member states, and institutions also, to the Russian leadership. Yet the only response is denial. This in itself is both ridiculous and incriminating. Ridiculous because any armed force in armed conflict can commit war crimes and crime against humanity, therefore it is always prudent to seek details and at least investigate. Incriminating in that the continual outright denial may well be because the Russian leadership knows these atrocities are being undertaken, indeed it expects these to take place because they are what it wants, it just doesn’t want to openly admit what it’s troops are doing. The fact that there has been no indication that Russian Forces have ceased to commit grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions since complaints have been raised indicates that the highest levels of leadership accept the atrocious behaviour of its forces and may actually encourage and direct such atrocities; either way, negligence is no defence, it’s the same as directing criminal atrocities.

In the Kremlin there is a criminal conspiracy to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, possibly genocide, and the crime of planning and execution of an aggressive war. Putin is at the head of the conspiracy. However, the conspirators can also be found at the operational, tactical and field levels, with all the commanders and their staffs. The conspiracy is huge, running to many hundreds, if not thousands. Then their are the individuals who actually killed, maimed, raped, looted, and committed the numerous individual crimes. Any war crime tribunal that undertakes investigation and prosecution for Putin’s War in Ukraine is going to have to be very well resourced and have a robust political backing.

Initially I had set out to list the war crimes, crimes against humanity and possible genocidal crimes Russian troops have been linked to in Ukraine since February 2022. To this is added the planning and execution of the crime of a war of aggression. The list of international crimes is so  long, one may just take whole sections of the Geneva Conventions ( Russia is party to most of these) and paste them into any article… it is easier to find the few crimes the Russians have not yet been linked to! However, I wouldn’t be surprised to find out, in time, that they have probably breached these also.",593548eff667194c39e68baa30e14c69f8267e94,True,False,,,,,0,1648990200,,0,{},i37umug,False,t3_tv0a1m,False,True,t3_tv0a1m,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tv0a1m/how_westerner_useful_idiots_lying_about_azov/i37umug/,1648990216,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648961400.0

[],False,,Alternative-Paint-46,,,[],,,,text,t2_atnqkklj,False,False,"You may be right. Like I said, we’ll find out in the end.  You’ve made a good point about one thing; why a fuel depot?On the surface, that question makes sense.  You’ve also easily dismissed two noisy helicopters flying 40+ miles, who are easy to hear and hit, and who go untouched before and after an attack.

It also appears that Putin’s bombing of his own people — leading to a costly Chechnya campaign — in order to get known and then elected, didn’t sow any doubt for you.

In defense of your belief, I’ve looked at the map and the city of Belgorod (where the fuel dept is located) and see it’s in the mid-eastern region of the Ukraine.  Exactly where Russia is supposedly shifting the focus of their campaign.  If it was in the West — where Russia is apparently moving out of — it would more easily support a false-flag.  But it’s not.

On the other hand, we also know that the Ukranians were initially blamed for a missile strike on a Belgorod camp that has now been shown to be an accidental fire.  See link:

https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-ukraine-strike-arms-depot-russia-belgorod-military-town-1693286?amp=1

So a couple questions to consider:

1) Is this fuel depot a permanent structure within Belgorad?  From one report I’m reading, this is a civilian fuel depot that’s not involved in the war campaign.  It’s worth considering, but either way it’s being “civilian” could be spun to support either theory.

2) If it’s a temporary facility set-up prior to the war in order to support the war campaign, the fuel depot — or the camp itself — may be deemed unworthy of keeping and thus a useful target for a false-flag(s).

3)  We already know that Putin would stop at almost nothing in order to give himself leverage.  We know that Russia has already been found guilty of major crimes against humanity and lying about them.  So in closing, why are you so quick to defend and believe Putin and Russia?  

Until proven otherwise, I will give the Ukranians the benefit of the doubt.

&gt; Missiles struck near Ukraine&amp;#039;s southern port of Odesa on Sunday with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military, while attempts to evacuate people from the devastated city of Mariupol were due to continue.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s defence ministry said strikes by its military destroyed an oil refinery and three fuel storage facilities near Odesa.

&gt; Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv&amp;#039;s rule.

The trails lead to field commanders and their staffs, tactical commanders and their staffs, the overall operational commander and his staff, the Kremlin and its siloviki and ultimately to the architect and director of this war, Putin. 

These events are widespread and systemic. That indicates not just individual responsibility but command responsibility. Either the operational command is being negligent in controlling its troops, or it is directing them to commit these atrocities, either way both neglect and intent are indictable as war crimes and crimes against humanity.

But the trail goes higher than the operational command. Complaints have been made by the UN and it’s member states, and institutions also, to the Russian leadership. Yet the only response is denial. This in itself is both ridiculous and incriminating. Ridiculous because any armed force in armed conflict can commit war crimes and crime against humanity, therefore it is always prudent to seek details and at least investigate. Incriminating in that the continual outright denial may well be because the Russian leadership knows these atrocities are being undertaken, indeed it expects these to take place because they are what it wants, it just doesn’t want to openly admit what it’s troops are doing. The fact that there has been no indication that Russian Forces have ceased to commit grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions since complaints have been raised indicates that the highest levels of leadership accept the atrocious behaviour of its forces and may actually encourage and direct such atrocities; either way, negligence is no defence, it’s the same as directing criminal atrocities.

In the Kremlin there is a criminal conspiracy to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, possibly genocide, and the crime of planning and execution of an aggressive war. Putin is at the head of the conspiracy. However, the conspirators can also be found at the operational, tactical and field levels, with all the commanders and their staffs. The conspiracy is huge, running to many hundreds, if not thousands. Then their are the individuals who actually killed, maimed, raped, looted, and committed the numerous individual crimes. Any war crime tribunal that undertakes investigation and prosecution for Putin’s War in Ukraine is going to have to be very well resourced and have a robust political backing.

Initially I had set out to list the war crimes, crimes against humanity and possible genocidal crimes Russian troops have been linked to in Ukraine since February 2022.

\*Russian forces continued to capture territory in central Mariupol on April 2 and will likely capture the city within days.

\*Ukrainian forces repelled several possibly large-scale Russian assaults in Donbas, claiming to destroy almost 70 Russian vehicles.

\*Russian forces will likely require a lengthy operational pause to integrate reinforcements into existing force structures in eastern Ukraine and enable successful operations but appear unlikely to do so and will continue to bleed their forces in ineffective daily attacks.

\*Russian forces in Izyum conducted an operational pause after successfully capturing the city on April 1 and will likely resume offensive operations to link up with Russian forces in Donbas in the coming days.

\*Russia continued to withdraw forces from the Kyiv axis into Belarus and Russia. Ukrainian forces primarily conducted operations to sweep and clear previously Russian-occupied territory.

\*Ukrainian forces likely repelled limited Russian attacks in Kherson Oblast.
