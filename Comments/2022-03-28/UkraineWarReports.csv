 We have no intentions of profiting from our content.

&gt;Are you planning to do any more detailed videos on specific area's.

We are currently working on an article about Russia's war crimes. We have several other sorts of explainers being explored. If you have any suggestions we would be happy to consider them.

&gt;And you didnt seem to answer the question in the post title?

Well we could try and provide a prediction about say, whether or not Belarus will enter the war, but no one knows. What we can do is give you the information to understand it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. There is a huge amount of uncertainty in war so no one can say what will happen. The best we can do is inform viewers and have them understand the major decisions being deliberated and what the consequences of decisions may be. 

We weren't trying to engage in clickbait, but legitimately I think if you're trying to understand what will happen next in the war your options are either the approach that we took or to engage in significant speculation, which is something which we try to avoid at all costs. I find it interesting that you feel like the video didn't answer the question, though, that's valuable feedback which we'll take into consideration.

It's not hard for a Russian to put some blue tape around their arm and make a video. What makes me even more suspicious about this is that the guy doesn't make any attempt to cover his face.

This is about the humanitarian cause. Neither does this support war crimes, nor does this spread propaganda any more than reddit or news or politicians. I haven't seen musicians, artists or politicians calling for inexperienced soldiers to enter Ukraine. Sorry but those who went there for some instagram war fap and got killed did that to themselves.

The sanctions hurt Russia in three ways: financial restrictions isolate Russian money, especially of those Russians who *have* money. For Russian oligarchs who ""parked"" their money in foreign countries where they considered it safe can not access it anymore. The inflation hurts those who have savings the most because those savings evaporate to nothing. Financial restrictions aren't decided by the people but by banks, credit institutes and states. It's not like cancel culture, but a well planned strategic cut off of money flow.

Then there are trade restriction of the states, like not buying Russian gas and oil anymore. Restricting Russian exports this way, even if not all countries can or want to join, tears a gigantic hole into Russian state income. They rely on their exports financially. If they can't export their oil anymore, they have less money for weapons. Again that's not a cancel culture thing like ""boohoo Putin bad"" but a well organized sanction with hopes to end the war sooner than later by making Russia unable to finance the war.

And only the third aspect are the private companies withdrawing from Russia. There the people can pressure single companies to withdraw, and use ""cancel culture"" to sanction those who don't. The effect is not that Russians can't buy shit anymore - that's not the goal. Empty warehouses is just a symptom. What really hurts them is that overnight thousands of Russians lost their jobs. Again hurting the economy as a whole, and making life in Russia uncomfortable, hoping to stirr up Russian people against Putin.

There should be a place of safe refuge for those press ganged to go. If they are pro-Ukrainian, then of course the first priority should be to “leave no man behind.” I’m saying to build some sort of shelter or place of refuge to give up your weapons and safely enter. It would have to be some sort of air raid shelter or a makeshift one perhaps. I still believe that there are also many Russian soldiers who would rather give up their weapons and surrender safely as well. It is not always realistic to merely “run for the hills” as it’s likely that there are Russian soldiers specifically tasked with shooting people who try to do that. While of course this is an ideal situation, likely it isn’t even approaching realistic in most cases. While I agree with your statement and wish it were that easy and simple, unfortunately it’s difficult to gain insight when you aren’t the one fighting. I am not fighting nor am I Ukrainian, but it’s important to be as genuinely realistic as possible in order to actually get the desired results. Your heart and mind are in the right place, though, my friend. And I can see that. 

We need to make it safer and easier for Russian conscripts or any Russian soldier or pro-Ukrainian civilian that was press ganged to join the Russian military to offer a safe harbor. Perhaps there can be makeshift shelters made such as this one:
