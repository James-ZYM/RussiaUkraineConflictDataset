This war is broad and complex, just as people are.  And however it's spun, Russia shouldn't be invading another country in the first place.  They have lost the moral high ground, and they are the initiator and aggressor.  If their forces are willing to kill civilians, they should be prepared for whatever comes to them, including injury and death.

No amount of you deflecting away from the fact changes that Putin chose to invade countries when Obama was in office and now Biden, not Trump, who would have benefitted him most if he was in league with him as you believe.

In the link I shared, it is reported that Trump's aides said he wanted to pull out of NATO. ""John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington’s influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades.""

You are trying to make John Bolton out to be some sort of Democratic operative?   Stop lying. 


&gt; Trump approved the 59 tomahawk cruise missile strike that destroyed the joint Syrian/Russian Shayrat airbase

The ""joint Syrian/Russian Shayrat airbase""?  That was Syrian alone. Not Russian. *Stop lying.*


&gt; With your level of IQ scrambling to google half truth articles...

They are 100% the truth, reported by Republicans appalled at how Trump - who literally a month ago called Putin a ""genius"" and ""savvy"" for the Ukraine invasion - adhered to Americas enemies while attacking our traditional allies.  

**“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine – of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.” ~ Donald Trump**

Or maybe 2017,  when Fox’s Bill O’Reilly called Putin a “killer” and Trump responded: “There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent? Do you think our country is so innocent?”


&gt; “eVeRy oNe I dOnT lIkE iS a rUsSiAn tRoLl!!”

You are a lying pro-Trump, and therefore pro-Putin, troll. Period.

I am not sure what the “implications” are when a commander has his command post near him.  How does that “imply” anything.  That’s like referring to the implications of a truck driver being near the truck.

As a precaution for what?  Many things.  Air Force One breaks down.  There’s a national security crisis that requires the unique communication facilities that the plane has.  The world is an unpredictable place, and things can happen at any moment, and if you have a mobile command post, would it not make sense to keep it near where you are?

The “informative video” is probably clickbait bullshit.  I didn’t even watch it, TBH.  I don’t need to.  My mental response on seeing the headline was “Oh, the E-4B, I’m pretty sure that follows the President around.  Nothing to see here.”  If you’re not paying for it, it’s not news.  It’s clickbait.  Period.  NYT, WSJ, Economist, The Atlantic, that’s a good collection of news sources because they are subscription based.  They don’t depend on clicks for their revenue.  They depend on subscribers who want to be informed paying monthly.  Take anything you see on a “free” news site with a grain of salt.",665615e8d7333ae1feb99e2e3cb8c35a6c3d98d1,True,False,,,,,0,1648444937,,0,{},i2ekla2,False,t3_tpfqlg,False,True,t1_i2eivvj,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tpfqlg/us_sends_nukeproof_doomsday_plane_boeing_747_e4b/i2ekla2/,1648444952,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648416137.0,

Nope.  That's 100% your strawman.  And such moral judgements (""okay/justified"") are completely irrelevant here anyway.  Scream all you want about injustice; it changes nothing.  The question is what should be done in the light of the context of nation-states and how they behave.  Something that's clearly way, way, *way* over your head.  Anyone is free to go back up to my original comment in this exchange to see exactly where I called it:

&gt; If you think this is a *moral* argument, then you just have no idea how nation-states and geopolitics work, and you don't know what a humanitarian and anti-war argument looks like (liberal).  You might want to brush up on these things.

So, back to square one where you are in over your head.  No point continuing this further with you.  Replying again would be a waste of time and energy.

Ah.  So now you're outright denying and apologizing for well-proven fascism.  Fucking YIKES!  I mean, even the U.S. government and the mainstream media very much acknowledged the existence and to a large degree the influence of those neo-Nazis right up until recently when it became very convenient not to.  The U.S. and Ukraine were literally the only nations who opposed a U.N. resolution condemning fascism.  The U.S. even acknowledged it was supporting the neo-Nazis and passed legislation making it illegal for the funding it provided Ukraine to go to them (2015)...and then immediately reversed that decision in 2016 and made it expressly legal to fund neo-Nazis again.  If you're ""checking your notes"" then you need to take WAAAAAAAAAY better notes.

Kyiv and western Ukraine wanted this.  People in Crimea, Donbas, and places like Odessa very much didn't.  Your support of established national borders (state oppression) over what people actually want is pretty telling.

And the U.S. overtly worked to sow dissent in order to move Ukraine toward NATO membership...well, really *de facto* membership and threatened future membership, as it had no chance of becoming a *de jure* NATO member anytime soon.  The U.S. overtly worked to sow dissent in order to move Ukraine *away* from Russian economic relations (not just toward the EU, as the forced choice was either accept subjugation to IMF austerity and trade with the EU while breaking ties with Russia, or continue to trade with Russia and accept Russia's deal of additional subsidies).  I mean, Russia even expressed willingness to negotiate a situation in which the EU, Ukraine, *and* Russia were part of a trade deal, but U.S./NATO/EU wouldn't touch it).

Putin **IS** a war criminal, he has planned and directed his forces in an international war crime, the crime of aggression, and has used war crimes, crimes against humanity and probably genocide to achieve his aims.  SO call him a War Criminal.

How can calling him out for what he is be damaging to relationships when Putin as lied to the international community, the UN, and has used his appointed higher ranking officers to lie to the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.  He loses to his own people.  How can one negotiate with such an outright criminal? ***It's like the police negotiating with a murderer while the corpses of his victims are still warm and he's pulling the knife out!***

So the likes of Macron - who think Bidden has made relationships more difficult.
