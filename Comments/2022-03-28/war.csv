Also the crimes against humanities part is disingenious (again see Iran f.e or Lybia, Gaddaffi was a despot but there the premise for the invasion was a lie and as many human rights organisations have confirmed and is even evident from the leaked Clinton E-Mails and the invasion and turning Lybia into a failed state caused much more suffering than not intervening).

Look up: Putin's Bombers Could Devastate Ukraine But He's Holding Back. Here's Why -Newsweek ; And before anyone misconstrues this: This does not justify any of Russia's illegal actions in any way and doesn't make the whole situation less tragic - that is also why I usually don't compare these things but this post is specifically about comparisons and when I see someone trying to use the horrible actions of one country to whitewashing those of another I find it to be disgusting - both the recent Russian and most of the US invasions can be condemned at the same time - I am a pacifist and war is sickening to me and I feel for all people who suffer as a result of it). Not to forget the two nukes in Japan specifically targeted civilians and killed 100-200k of them. 

Finally also this ""Coalition forces were actually quite welcomed into Iraq by locals"" is simply misleading as well because some locals aren't all locals and most Iraqis did not welcome the US invasion.",d2551f7907aaa89fc924598ecd1ee2f057c41a65,True,False,,,,,0,1648429200,,0,{},i2drabs,False,t3_tprptz,False,True,t1_i2d1foz,/r/war/comments/tprptz/russias_invasions_vs_americas/i2drabs/,1648429214,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648400400.0,,,,

Cuba, Panama and Grenada belong to the American sphere of influence. This means whenever someone in this sphere does something that America dislikes, then America starts a coup or invasion. Half of Latin America got overthrown of invaded through America in the 20th century.

The First Gulf War was legal according to international law.

Somalia started as humanitarian intervention and ended in a shit show, when America send it's special forces, which ended bombing a huge part of mogadishu and killing thousands of civilians on their retreat after they failed an operation.

Afghanistan is a unique case, because America declared war to a country, because it was unwilling to persecute a criminal organisation. They tried to install a new regime, that remained unpopular amongst the Afghan majority and as we all heared last year the Afghans chose the same guys to lead their country like before the invasion.

Iraq was an again a invasion under false circumstances (chemical weapons). Americans were unable to recognize the social dynamics of Iraq.  They destabilzed the country and left it.

Does America bombs indicriminatley? Yes, it does it all the time with zero care for civilian casualties.  If it wouldn't be like this, then they wouldn't block ICC investigations and enforce strong censorship in war zones.

It also seems obvious that the Ukrainian Army wants to hide behind civilians and to make it harder to distinguish between military and civilian by arming the civilians(both with rifles and Molotov cocktails).

As a rational matter, the burden of proof must fall on Ukraine to prove Russia intentionally targeted civilians, and that Ukrainian military weren't imbedded in the apartments/housing areas that were targeted.

Likewise, I've heard endless claims that Russia/Syria used chemical weapons during the Civil War. This is another claim that doesn't stand up to reason.

And it is called PROPAGANDA. If Russians were that shitty, USA would eat them in the Cold War, there is a reason USA didn't attack them and created NATO against Soviets.  


2- You are only seeing what you want to see. I'm saying that Zelensky supported people who attack weak people and know he is the one attacked and you are not even saying anything about it.  


3- If the top dogs(Nato) gave you ammunition and weapons to fight someone you would do a good job against anyone. Ukraine has a small military. Their whole air forces and navy got destroyed in 2 hours by Russia. But yes i kinda agree with you on this Russia got a higher death toll than i expected. But eventually they have bigger guns, more guns, more soldiers, bigger economy than Ukraine. Eventually Ukraine will fall no matter what unless anything unexpected happens.  


4- Russia told Ukraine not to join NATO because it would bring enemy to Russia's door. It would allow USA to open bases in Ukraine soil, near the Russian borders which would be a treat to Russia. Even though Ukraine is not a member of the NATO they allowed USA to open a military base in Ukrainian soil which led them to war. Russia wanted to make sure Ukraine didn't join NATO that is why they attacked them to dethrone the government. We all know Zelensky is a puppet of the USA. I can't blame Russia for ensuring their own safety.

The navy appeared to have given up on making a contested landing in Odessa. From my understanding there is a relatively small area to land which is already heavily fortified. 

The 3 heavy landing ships available in the Black Sea started to offload equipment and men at the undamaged, uncontested port of Berdansk in support of the Marioupul front where 1 of the 3 was destroyed and the others were possibly damaged.

Sounds like you just heard this sentence a few times on the internet and believe it to some degree. It's a very vague statement. I gave a very basic overview of recent US invasionsa and I would suggest looking into things further yourself to gain a better understanding of US conflicts if you are interested in doing so. 

To make a long story short on the Russian situation, Putin is disconnected from reality and justifies a war based on fantasies and personal ideologies and beliefs. Not beliefs of the nation or even his government, but he himself. A man who misses the glory of the Soviet union but also himself propped up as a corrupt thug and grew his political career through corruption and manipulation. He does not believe in an independant Ukraine and wants to reunify it with Russia despite Ukrainians wanting nothing to do with Russia and having been discontented with the Russian-propped government for a long time. Russia has been trying to control the narrative for 8 years and has now doubled down on its own people by banning independant media, censoring its population, banning western social media, and imprisoning protestors. Its no longer suppressing its political opponents, but its own people as well now.",b44b18ea7e3f794b173fd9d8908861dcb23f663b,True,False,,,,,0,1648444409,,0,{},i2ejs5t,False,t3_tprptz,False,True,t1_i2d5itk,/r/war/comments/tprptz/russias_invasions_vs_americas/i2ejs5t/,1648444423,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648415609.0,,,,

Keeping civilians against their will is incredibly stupid for a number of reasons. 

1: you have to protect them, they are a liability and a hindrance to your forces. 99% of them are useless in combat.

2: They are a strain on your limited resources. They use up your food, water and medical equipment. 

3: Russians have proven time and again, the ""human shields"" bullshit is of no consequence to them. When they shelled a maternity ward and later a theater full of children, even a Russian would understand that they don't give a fuck, so it's back to the two first reasons. 

The Russians are the ones who will not let Mariupol civilians leave, exactly for the reasons mentioned above.

You know they hide tanks, howitzers, and other equipment in densely-populated areas because they cannot fight the Russian Army in the open. You know they want to shoot at Russians without the Russians being able to shoot back.

As for what to do about NATO, neutrality, and Russia. I think Ukraine either needs to be split apart, or it needs to remain neutral. It is difficult for me to feel sorry for Ukraine when they refuse to even cede Crimea. Which wasn't added to Ukraine until 1954, and where there are basically zero ethnic Ukrainians.

The Ukrainians have been completely unreasonable, and the reason is because they are working for the interests of the United States government. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt governments in the world, even worse than Russia. It is not democratic, and it is not free. The Ukrainian government has not only banned opposition media, but it has recently banned all political parties.

I hate to even mention what Azov has been doing. They were shooting captured soldiers in the legs the other day. The Ukrainians have from the very beginning done nothing but show gore video of Russian soldiers. They also torture Russians and record it, often stripping them down to their underwear in the winter cold, tying them to poles and beating them, forcing terrified soldiers to denounce Putin and to call their mothers on cell phones to confess their crimes.

The Taliban were a million times more honorable of soldiers than the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have been an absolute embarrassment for Europe and for the white race. Only ISIS exceeds their cruelty.

All while the Western media gushes over that moron Zelensky, who refuses to let any men leave his country, which I can only assume is because he wants to get all slavic men killed. This whole thing is a joke.

With that said, I don't even blame Ukraine, I blame the United States of America. I know for a fact that everything is being orchestrated by America. I know for a fact that America wanted this war. I know for a fact that America doesn't care if every Ukrainian is killed.

U.S. Arms and training  
In March 2015 Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in their Operation Fearless Guardian training mission.\[51\]\[52\] US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the battalion due to its neo-Nazi background.\[53\] However, the amendment was later removed in November 2015, with The Nation reporting that the ""House Defense Appropriations Committee came under pressure from the Pentagon to remove the Conyers-Yoho amendment from the text of the bill.""\[54\]  
  
Azov published a media release on its website on 20 November 2017 stating that it had met with a foreign delegation of officers from the United States Armed Forces and Canadian Armed Forces on 16 November.\[55\]\[third-party source needed\] Writing for Jacobin, Branko Marcetic says that members of Azov have been pictured meeting with U.S. military and NATO officials.\[56\]  
  
US Democrats request for designation as Foreign Terrorist Organization  
In October 2019, members of the US House of Representatives from the Democratic Party requested that the Azov Battalion and two other far-right groups be classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department, citing recent acts of right-wing violence such as the Christchurch mosque shootings earlier that year. The request spurred protests by Azov's supporters in Ukraine.\[57\]\[58\]\[59\]  
  
In February 2020, the Atlantic Council published an article by Anton Shekhovtsov which argued forcefully ""Why Azov should not be designated a foreign terrorist organization"" because it was now ""a regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard that is part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,"" that the links with Brenton Tarrant had been overdone, and cited a Federal Court decision which was detrimental to the terrorist theory.\[60\] On the other hand the Jerusalem Post carried an article in October 2021 that cited a George Washington University report and unearthed problems with the ideological sieve used by the Ukrainian armed forces.\[61\]  
  
Use in Russian propaganda

In 2013 Euromaidan protest sparked against Yanukovich's decision to not sign European UnionâUkraine Association Agreement. Ukrainian parliament voted in favor of agreement and people of Ukraine were also liked agreement to be signed. Russia put economic pressure on Ukraine which caused first sparks of hate to be born. Violent dispersion of Euromaidan caused people to start Maidan revolution, where more than 100 people died. ""Right Sector"" formed at the end of revolution, they thrived on peoples fear and anger like any other radical organisation, fear of government corruption, anger towards Yanukovich whom conveniently fled to Russia. ""Right Sector"" failed to take any governmental power but still caused ultranationalist views to gain popularity which later caused formation of Azov, members of which more ultranationalist more than they neo-nazi. 

They didn't appear in snap of a finger, but in gradual radicalisation of angry, fearful and oppressed people in to their ranks. Even in such convenient breeding grounds for radicals, they still failed to get any governmental power which is a miracle by itself, which tells us how accepting people of Ukraine really are.",c7969490727fa2abaec020bfd123589e3733cdd6,True,False,,,,,0,1648472783,,0,{},i2flnaj,False,t3_tq1tbe,False,False,t1_i2fc6zq,/r/war/comments/tq1tbe/reports_of_ukrainian_soldiers_shooting_russian/i2flnaj/,1648472801,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648443983.0,,,,

Ukraine was a corrupt Russian vassal state with an elected pro Russian government from 1991 until 2014. In 2011 new oil deposits were discovered. The US made a grab for Ukrainian resources by financing a successful a coup in 2014. (One year prior to the scheduled election.) That was followed by money laundering between US politicians and Ukrainians. 

Russia opposed the coup and immediately started a civil war to to keep those resources. They set the battle lines on the Left and Right Bank divide of the Dnieper River that separated historic Russian territory from historic Ukrainian territory. They were successful in Crimea, and semi successful in Donetsk and Luhansk. Mariupol and Odessa were quickly pacified by Ukraine.  

Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk have been fighting the civil war since 2014.  Ukraine was targeting civilians in an effort to ethnically cleanse Russian civilians from those territories, with Russians providing weapons and advisors. When Biden became president, in 2021, he sent advanced US weapons and green beret advisors to assist Ukraine in its 8 year old civil war. Seeing the impending loss of resources and doom of Russian civilians, Russia invaded.

If you look at war maps, you will see that except for cutting off Kiev, for strategic reasons, the invasion stopped at the historic Left Bank of the Dnieper. Russia is planning on keeping the Left Bank as an independent Vassal state, or absorbing it like they did with Crimea. Logically they would want to limit damages and civilian casualties in those regions. Ukraine on the other hand, knowing it will lose those regions are performing a scorched earth retreat to cause s much pain to Russia as possible. Azov, has been at the forefront of Ukraine's ethnic cleansing efforts and stated they will kill as many Russian civilians as they can and raze the cities, rather than surrender them. 

No side is innocent in this grab for resources. Not the corrupt US politicians for starting the civil war and later inflaming it further, so their sons can continue laundering billions of dollars. Not the US puppet Ukrainian government that wants to genocide it's Russian population for wanting to secede with the resources. And not the Russians for backing and supplying the rebels, and later invading to keep those resources. 

It is a shit show all around, but the truth of what each of the three sides is doing is being hidden by propaganda. The truth can be found if you disregard the smoke and mirrors.",37b8f82359f2565844304900790269f413b97c7f,True,True,,,,,0,1648483711,,0,{},i2gala0,False,t3_tpi1k8,False,True,t1_i2g08ns,/r/war/comments/tpi1k8/mariupol_in_response_to_russian_soldiers/i2gala0/,1648483725,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648454911.0,,,,
