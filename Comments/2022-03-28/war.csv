But he still won in 2010 and immediately changed his mind on European integration and decided to build economic ties with Russia instead. One of his decisions is to let Russia build naval bases in Crimea for gas discounts which later led to quick annexation of Crimea.

Ukrainian parliament voted in favor of agreement and people of Ukraine were also liked agreement to be signed. Russia put economic pressure on Ukraine which caused first sparks of hate to be born.

U.S. Arms and training  
In March 2015 Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that the Azov Regiment would be among the first units to be trained by United States Army troops in their Operation Fearless Guardian training mission.\[51\]\[52\] US training however was withdrawn on 12 June 2015, as the US House of Representatives passed an amendment blocking any aid (including arms and training) to the battalion due to its neo-Nazi background.\[53\] However, the amendment was later removed in November 2015, with The Nation reporting that the ""House Defense Appropriations Committee came under pressure from the Pentagon to remove the Conyers-Yoho amendment from the text of the bill.""\[54\]  
  
Azov published a media release on its website on 20 November 2017 stating that it had met with a foreign delegation of officers from the United States Armed Forces and Canadian Armed Forces on 16 November.\[55\]\[third-party source needed\] Writing for Jacobin, Branko Marcetic says that members of Azov have been pictured meeting with U.S. military and NATO officials.\[56\]  
  
US Democrats request for designation as Foreign Terrorist Organization  
In October 2019, members of the US House of Representatives from the Democratic Party requested that the Azov Battalion and two other far-right groups be classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US State Department, citing recent acts of right-wing violence such as the Christchurch mosque shootings earlier that year. The request spurred protests by Azov's supporters in Ukraine.\[57\]\[58\]\[59\]  
  
In February 2020, the Atlantic Council published an article by Anton Shekhovtsov which argued forcefully ""Why Azov should not be designated a foreign terrorist organization"" because it was now ""a regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard that is part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,"" that the links with Brenton Tarrant had been overdone, and cited a Federal Court decision which was detrimental to the terrorist theory.\[60\] On the other hand the Jerusalem Post carried an article in October 2021 that cited a George Washington University report and unearthed problems with the ideological sieve used by the Ukrainian armed forces.\[61\]  
  
Use in Russian propaganda  
In justifying the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the Battalion has played a central role in claims of ""denazifying"" Ukraine, with Russian media inflating its presence and influence within Ukraine to paint of picture of the whole of the Ukrainian government and military as under Nazi control.\[62\]

The Russians are, odd as it may sound, attempting to win hearts and minds, or at least not generate hatred amongst the Ukrainians or give the West excuses to intervene further. 

They have bent over backwards (with a few exceptions) to minimise loss of civilian and even military life. The response from the Ukrainian side has been to exploit this to the hilt to conduct a conventional war in the style of a guerilla war, where military personal, for example, station themselves in schools, store equipment in shopping malls, and transport troops and weapons in civilian vehicles (like cars and DHS trucks). Russia has, for the most part, accepted heavy casualties to \*not\* do a Dresden style campaign of terror bombing.

You know they want to shoot at Russians without the Russians being able to shoot back.

As for what to do about NATO, neutrality, and Russia. I think Ukraine either needs to be split apart, or it needs to remain neutral. It is difficult for me to feel sorry for Ukraine when they refuse to even cede Crimea. Which wasn't added to Ukraine until 1954, and where there are basically zero ethnic Ukrainians.

The Ukrainians have been completely unreasonable, and the reason is because they are working for the interests of the United States government. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt governments in the world, even worse than Russia. It is not democratic, and it is not free. The Ukrainian government has not only banned opposition media, but it has recently banned all political parties.

I hate to even mention what Azov has been doing. They were shooting captured soldiers in the legs the other day. The Ukrainians have from the very beginning done nothing but show gore video of Russian soldiers. They also torture Russians and record it, often stripping them down to their underwear in the winter cold, tying them to poles and beating them, forcing terrified soldiers to denounce Putin and to call their mothers on cell phones to confess their crimes.

The Taliban were a million times more honorable of soldiers than the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have been an absolute embarrassment for Europe and for the white race. Only ISIS exceeds their cruelty.

All while the Western media gushes over that moron Zelensky, who refuses to let any men leave his country, which I can only assume is because he wants to get all slavic men killed. This whole thing is a joke.

With that said, I don't even blame Ukraine, I blame the United States of America. I know for a fact that everything is being orchestrated by America. I know for a fact that America wanted this war. I know for a fact that America doesn't care if every Ukrainian is killed.

2: They are a strain on your limited resources. They use up your food, water and medical equipment. 

3: Russians have proven time and again, the ""human shields"" bullshit is of no consequence to them. When they shelled a maternity ward and later a theater full of children, even a Russian would understand that they don't give a fuck, so it's back to the two first reasons.

Sounds like you just heard this sentence a few times on the internet and believe it to some degree. It's a very vague statement. I gave a very basic overview of recent US invasionsa and I would suggest looking into things further yourself to gain a better understanding of US conflicts if you are interested in doing so. 

To make a long story short on the Russian situation, Putin is disconnected from reality and justifies a war based on fantasies and personal ideologies and beliefs. Not beliefs of the nation or even his government, but he himself. A man who misses the glory of the Soviet union but also himself propped up as a corrupt thug and grew his political career through corruption and manipulation. He does not believe in an independant Ukraine and wants to reunify it with Russia despite Ukrainians wanting nothing to do with Russia and having been discontented with the Russian-propped government for a long time. Russia has been trying to control the narrative for 8 years and has now doubled down on its own people by banning independant media, censoring its population, banning western social media, and imprisoning protestors. Its no longer suppressing its political opponents, but its own people as well now.",b44b18ea7e3f794b173fd9d8908861dcb23f663b,True,False,,,,,0,1648444409,,0,{},i2ejs5t,False,t3_tprptz,False,True,t1_i2d5itk,/r/war/comments/tprptz/russias_invasions_vs_americas/i2ejs5t/,1648444423,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648415609.0,

3- If the top dogs(Nato) gave you ammunition and weapons to fight someone you would do a good job against anyone. Ukraine has a small military. Their whole air forces and navy got destroyed in 2 hours by Russia. But yes i kinda agree with you on this Russia got a higher death toll than i expected. But eventually they have bigger guns, more guns, more soldiers, bigger economy than Ukraine. Eventually Ukraine will fall no matter what unless anything unexpected happens.  


4- Russia told Ukraine not to join NATO because it would bring enemy to Russia's door. It would allow USA to open bases in Ukraine soil, near the Russian borders which would be a treat to Russia. Even though Ukraine is not a member of the NATO they allowed USA to open a military base in Ukrainian soil which led them to war. Russia wanted to make sure Ukraine didn't join NATO that is why they attacked them to dethrone the government. We all know Zelensky is a puppet of the USA.

It also seems obvious that the Ukrainian Army wants to hide behind civilians and to make it harder to distinguish between military and civilian by arming the civilians(both with rifles and Molotov cocktails).

As a rational matter, the burden of proof must fall on Ukraine to prove Russia intentionally targeted civilians, and that Ukrainian military weren't imbedded in the apartments/housing areas that were targeted.

Likewise, I've heard endless claims that Russia/Syria used chemical weapons during the Civil War. This is another claim that doesn't stand up to reason. The government had absolutely nothing to gain from using chemical weapon. They were winning, and using chemicals weapons would and did draw the United States further into the war.

Somalia started as humanitarian intervention and ended in a shit show, when America send it's special forces, which ended bombing a huge part of mogadishu and killing thousands of civilians on their retreat after they failed an operation.

Afghanistan is a unique case, because America declared war to a country, because it was unwilling to persecute a criminal organisation. They tried to install a new regime, that remained unpopular amongst the Afghan majority and as we all heared last year the Afghans chose the same guys to lead their country like before the invasion.

Iraq was an again a invasion under false circumstances (chemical weapons). Americans were unable to recognize the social dynamics of Iraq.  They destabilzed the country and left it.

Also the crimes against humanities part is disingenious (again see Iran f.e or Lybia, Gaddaffi was a despot but there the premise for the invasion was a lie and as many human rights organisations have confirmed and is even evident from the leaked Clinton E-Mails and the invasion and turning Lybia into a failed state caused much more suffering than not intervening). Bush Jr  wanted to do what Bush Sr. didn't that was his motive and it is well reported that he didn't even know anything about Iraq or Saddam even his own staff said so (read John Nixon's book about that if you are interested). Saddam was not even a siginificant political figure at the time anymore. 

Also ""I would also like to comment on the specific targetting and indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, residential areas, and non-military targets"" is just plain wrong. This is one of the points that was is most heavily criticized about the ""shock and awe"" campaigns the US conducts (bombs cities into oblivion - in the first few weeks over 15000 Iraqi civilians were killed compared to roughly 1000-1500 in Ukraine - still a massive tragedy and completely unnecessary no doubt but US officials themelves are saying that the Russian approach is more ""gentle"". Look up: Putin's Bombers Could Devastate Ukraine But He's Holding Back. Here's Why -Newsweek ; And before anyone misconstrues this: This does not justify any of Russia's illegal actions in any way and doesn't make the whole situation less tragic - that is also why I usually don't compare these things but this post is specifically about comparisons and when I see someone trying to use the horrible actions of one country to whitewashing those of another I find it to be disgusting - both the recent Russian and most of the US invasions can be condemned at the same time - I am a pacifist and war is sickening to me and I feel for all people who suffer as a result of it). Not to forget the two nukes in Japan specifically targeted civilians and killed 100-200k of them. 

Finally also this ""Coalition forces were actually quite welcomed into Iraq by locals"" is simply misleading as well because some locals aren't all locals and most Iraqis did not welcome the US invasion.",d2551f7907aaa89fc924598ecd1ee2f057c41a65,True,False,,,,,0,1648429200,,0,{},i2drabs,False,t3_tprptz,False,True,t1_i2d1foz,/r/war/comments/tprptz/russias_invasions_vs_americas/i2drabs/,1648429214,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648400400.0,

I truly hope that at least the surrendered are treated with the dignity afforded them as per the Geneva Convention. 

War is war is war, and only now is the horror of it so easily accessible to any random civilian with an internet connection 

It's never been the epic and glorious event, as we prefer to think of it, when the sons, brothers, father's and husbands are laying in their own piss and shit, bleeding out to the moans of their fellow soldiers and the contemptuous cackling of the victorious. I doubt one feels very heroic when you can hear the gurgles of your stomach digesting itself as you gnaw on a long-expired piece of dehydrated mystery meat, stop a background soundtrack of your brother-in-arms gleefully raping a local while her wailing daughter awaits her turn. 

All of it has always happened, on both sides, by some if not all, regardless of the righteousness of their cause...because the reality of war drives people quite out of their civilian minds. Obviously it does, because everyday people could not stomach what they have been tasked with if they didn't allow the feral part of themselves a turn at the wheel. 

But I sincerely hope that the modern EYE we now have on an ancient practice might begin to turn us away from it ... That the disgust might grow, and our excuses and rationalizations might begin to lose potency as we're no longer afforded the luxury of ignorance. 

Sorry, I'm rambling, I know. 

I tell myself that I can't possibly be surprised at these actions, regardless of which side is perpetrating it. War hasn't stopped being war, and there will never be an army devoid of cruelty ...the kind of cruelty that appears utterly pointless along with the kind of cruelty that looks a lot more like justice. Like avenging the innocent. 

But unfortunately it distracts from the point, it lays a distorting static over the measaging that has so far secured the support of such a huge portion of the world. 

Never was the sentiment of solidarity and the motivation for people from uninvolved nations around the globe to pick up arms to defend the Ukrainians ever stronger than when we were seeing the terrified and dangerously misled youth of Russia being carefully treated and offered mercy upon surrender. 

I hope we continue to see more of it. As humans we seem particularly swayed and influenced by the emotions that such scenes evoke, because we can relate to that more than we can relate to mocking a dying or unarmed person as we cripple them (despite whether or not it was deserved) .... And so I believe mercy is infinitely more useful in strengthening the force that is Ukraine and it's defenders.",70bfda121a43430d8b007063263d953bc19aa750,True,False,,,,,0,1648421905,,0,{},i2dc187,False,t3_tpeaxs,False,True,t1_i2apghk,/r/war/comments/tpeaxs/ukraine_army_murdering_and_mutilating_russian_pows/i2dc187/,1648421920,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648393105.0,

If the missile penetrates the armor the actual hole can be quite small, anywhere from a finger sized hole up to the size of a your fist. Pressure can increase dramatically inside the crew compartment. This can cause a lot of tissue damage, brushing across the entire body, ruptured eardrum, burst lungs.

If the body is in the path of the hot gas/plasma from the warhead explosion there can be a lot of tearing or shredding of the body. It can punch watermelon size holes in people.

If the ammunition cooks and spills into the crew compartment it turns the tank into a blast furnace instantly turning bodies into charcoal.

If the round doesn't penetrate the shockwave can still kill crew. A general purpose bomb like a  JDAM has a large amount of explosives, if you hit a tank with 500 to 2,000 pounds of explosive bomb it can collapse sections of the armor creating fragmentation that shreds the crew.

That fragmentation is called [spalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spall), that spalling can sort of shotgun out and ricochet around causing a lot of wounds similar to gunshots. Most tanks have anti-spall materials to reduce this but if it's a catastrophic hit it's not going to stop it.",3e4d4d3672691a6c499c79760cdb42aa40a4a3d2,True,False,,,,,0,1648419393,,0,{},i2d70hc,False,t3_tpl6h4,False,True,t1_i2cxot3,/r/war/comments/tpl6h4/russian_tank_destroyed_by_ukranian_atgm/i2d70hc/,1648419406,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648390593.0,

Consider [Tercom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERCOM) was in cruise missiles half a century ago, you just have to play with a few cell phone apps to see what kind of image recognition can be done on cheap electronics these days. So it should not be too hard to program a drone with a user-friendly UI to patrol a certain area using cheap cameras for terrain recognition looking for tanks with the same cameras and bombing them, or returning to the pickup point if none are found. Without the typical defence industry mark up it is only a few thousand dollars worths of model aeroplane parts and the kind of camera and processors found in everyone's pockets.

Search just told me the price of a switchblade kamikaze drone is only $6000 so the markup must not be that high. Quite a bargain for something that has a longer range than a Javelin missile. It is probably only a software update away from the kind of autonomous hunter-killer functionality I just described.

So electronic jamming won't be an effective defence against drones with the software to operate autonomously. You could arm tanks with automatic anti-aircraft guns for destroying drones, but how deep are their magazines?

Vietnam: Defend democratic government and ethnic groups in the south who opposed communism and to stop the spread of Communism from both Russians and Chinese in South East Asia. The US did not invade North Vietnam (but incursions and bombings were carried out).  


Grenada: Triggered by execution of a political leader and threat posed to US nationals from the Communist regime. U.S. launched a military intervention following receipt of a formal appeal for help from the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. It was criticized by international community for violation of international law.  


Panama: To overthrow military dictator Manuel Noriega who had been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges and was accused of suppressing democracy in Panama and endangering U.S. nationals. Also to secure the Panama canal.  


Cuba: Communism and communist dictator Fidel Castro - support from USSR and bringing missiles to Cuba.  


First Gulf War: Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was an ally to the US. Ended with the Iraqi retreat from Kuwait.  


Second Gulf War (invasion of Iraq): This one is arguably quite questionable. US and UK held no-fly zones in parts of Iraq to stop bombardment of Iraqi Kurds and Shias by Iraqi government forces. Basically to oust the dictator Saddam and instill democracy in Iraq. American forces were actually quite welcomed into Iraq by locals but due to sectarian tensions and different ethnic/religious groups clashing and failure to instill and popular organized government, led to years of insurgency.  


Afghanistan: 9/11 and Al-Qaeda terrorists I guess. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda was main target ""and punish the Taliban for providing safe haven to al-Qaida leaders.""  


So as you can see, some of these conflicts could be quite questionable - but the theme remains the same. Ousting dictators (most notably communist dictators) and terrorism, as well as crimes against humanity.  


Now lets compare it to Russia's invasion of Ukraine:  


Russian invasion of Ukraine: With the maidan protests in 2014 and popular public movement to oust the Pro-Russian government in Kiev (removal of Yanukovych), Ukrainians sought to remove the Pro-Russian government and bring the country to join EU. With the ousting of this government, Russia illegally annexed Crimea and held a referendum where seemingly majority of Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation. With a rather small movement in the Donbass region to cecede from Ukraine and create a pro-Russian independent republic not supported by even the local governments, Russia latched on and supported this illegal republic. Russia fueled the 8-year long war in the donbass by supporting the separatists, arming them, and sending Russian military to fight against Ukrainians alongside the separatists. Come February 2022, Russia invades Ukraine's sovereign territory to oust the Ukrainian government claiming them as a nazi regime, who are in fact a publicly elected democratic government. It is not a dictatorship, and is not cruel against it's civilians. It has also been fighting 8 years against the Russians in illegally occupied territory by the Russians.   


It may have similarities, but there are some very clear differences. Not only that, but Russia incited much of the violence happening in Ukraine after the ousting of Yanukovych and is using the pro-russian supporters in the donbass for its own personal interests. Russia claimed ""peacekeeping"" operations but this is clearly not that. Russia also lies to its own citizens, bans independent media, doesnt give a shit about even it's own citizens, is run by an egotistical dictator and thiefs/thugs from the soviet era who steal from the russian people and have giant mansions and yachts in the west, shop in the west, and send their children to schools in the west. Russia isn't invading because it cares about the people in Donbass or Crimea. Russia is invading because of it's own personal interests in the country. Ukraine is one of the top exporters of grain and steel, and Crimea / Black Sea coast is a highly valuable strategic area.   


I would also like to comment on the specific targetting and indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, residential areas, and non-military targets. While civilian deaths happen in war, and mistakes happen, it has been a specific thing in this war for Russians to target civilian areas to subdue Ukraine because of it's lack of success in the onset of the invasion.",ca2fcd1a129a38cd4b0427dea74d4c1268f6df24,True,False,,,,,0,1648416703,,0,{},i2d1foz,False,t3_tprptz,False,True,t3_tprptz,/r/war/comments/tprptz/russias_invasions_vs_americas/i2d1foz/,1648416720,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648387903.0,

Trump tried to overthrow our democracy, and is a “strongman” (actually isn’t very strong) that his supporters blindly follow because of propaganda. Putin is a fascist, and I think Trumpism is about as close as you can get to mainstream fascism in the United States. There are many Trumpers in America that seem to be pro-Putin even after the invasion, and parrot a lot of the Kremlins anti Ukraine talking points and propaganda. Trump is a wannabe autocrat, and is a complete narcissist like Putin. However, I guess that is all somewhat subjective.

This means US may prioritised sending lethal and humanitarian aid to front-line Nato countries before joining for a full-scale counter attack when russian resources are spent. 

Putin did mentioned last month that Russia is significantly weaker than Nato due to difference of technology and manpower.
