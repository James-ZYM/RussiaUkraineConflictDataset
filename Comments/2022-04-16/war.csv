Unlike Russia, which seems to have gone backwards since the end of the second world war. Over 80 percent support Putin, live in ignorance and have backward opinions on issues pertaining to race, religion and LGBTQ+.

Sure, a lot of it might be due to trauma after WW2, Stalin and the collapse of the Soviet Union, but at some point you need to get your act together. Right now they are filth on the level of Milošević loving serbs.

*""that people can literally start condoning genocide, and I'm sickened that it's become an accepted thing to say in these sorts of subreddits.""*  
This is hard for you to understand is it?  These are reactionary comments because Russia started it, and is already committing genocide. And they have always done it. Read about Georgia(country) Armenia, Chechnya, Holodomor,  The winter offensive of 1945 when they raped/killed/looted their way across Europe.  

Three weeks ago they flew four jets into Swedish airspace, two of them visibly armed with nukes. In the middle of a fucking war. Russia is one giant asshole and Russians are the shit that comes out of it.

I live in a country with these psychotic fuckers on our border. We have lived with these bastards and their posturing and brinkmanship since WW2. Every week there is something in the news about some Russian navy vessel or air force jet or bomber acting like dicks, entering our air space, or territorial waters, or they makes some fucking demand or other. 80 years of this shit. 

I suggest you try that before you morally high horse anyone who want to give Russia their own medicine. You can fuck right off with your ""Oh, no that's genocide of the poor Russian people you're asking for, evil you!""

Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine right now, and all of us next door are faced with the very real prospect of doing the same, if they fail to defend themselves. 

Un-Fascist-ing Russia is pretty high on my and every one else in Europe's list right now, and as it was with Germany 80 years ago, they are not going to go either easily or quietly. 

Putin has an 80%+ approval rate. Just apply some thought and understand what that means. Let me break it down for you. 80 of a hundred Russians are slavic fascists and they want to come here and take my country, kill me, rape my children and their mother, like they are doing in Ukraine. Right now. 

Me on the other hand only want them to stay in their dystopian shit hole country and leave us the fuck alone. Since that is no longer on the table, then yes. Option 2. I want the 80% dead, so the +/-20% left of decent Russians can rebuild the country into something that doesn't actively hate and covet it's neighbours. **This is** ***their*** **rules, how** ***they*** **play. NONE of us asked for any of this shit,** and yet here we are because those THINGS want us dead or conquered.",e88a881def434a69a2f4acfa4ba5e0b7eb455266,True,False,,,,,0,1650111891,,0,{},i4y7gn9,False,t3_u4g0ej,False,True,t1_i4xymvt,/r/war/comments/u4g0ej/russian_soldier_and_his_wife_who_wanted_to_rape/i4y7gn9/,1650111905,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1650083091.0,

Technically the Neptune should not have been able to sink the ship. It has a 150 kg warhead, even if it hit ammunition storage the fires should have been dealt with by the damage control teams.

The damage control teams had to fail so miserably for the ship to sink. When battle stations are usually called all water tight doors are supposed to be shut, that should hold back flooding and fires. The only way the ship could have sunk from an accident or missile is if they didn't follow procedure.

For example, during a sinkex [DDG-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Buchanan_(DDG-14\)) was hit with 3 hellfire missiles, 3 harpoon missiles, a 2,400 pound laser guided bomb. She still didn't sink and was 1/5th size of Moskva. They had to detonate 200 pounds of explosives to finally get her to sink.
