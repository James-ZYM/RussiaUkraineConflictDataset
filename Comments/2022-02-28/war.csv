Could NATO pull off a full scale invasion of Russia, however? Not at the moment and not with the current doctrine. But, given time and motivation, NATO could easily arm themselves to the task.

Now I'm not sure what the other commenter is getting at when referring to manpower - this isnt 1941 or Stalingrad and that's not how wars are fought. Absolute air superiority would prevent much in the way of reinforcements, and poorly armed troops can barely survive a mechanized modern battlefield. City fighting, however, is still the bane of every army in existence, but without reinforcements able to reach the battle space, we've gotten pretty good and clearing urbanized areas.

The Russian military does have massive stockpiles of older equipment, but Iraq showed how useless that is in the face of modernization.

&gt;Quick answer: nobody. Let’s look at a possible scenario that might lead to such a nightmare:  
Buoyed by successes so far in the Ukraine, Putin and his generals decide to swallow the rest of the nation as well. They believe NATO is demoralized by U.S. trade demands. The just-completed new gas pipeline to Europe gives Russia the ability to mediate European criticism, now that winter is coming on. The strike will be too quick and overwhelming for the Ukrainians to either fight much or complain.  
Battles never go as planned. Ukrainian resistance is far stiffer than expected. What was foreseen as a blitzkrieg-like strike that would be over in a few days has turned into a two-month siege with very little movement and no end in sight. Even worse, Ukrainian forces are now being openly supplied by NATO, and “volunteer” units from Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Hungary are beginning to show up in enemy lines.  
Russian generals offer a solution — a series of “surgical” nuclear strikes behind and on the Ukrainian line, along with a larger device to take out Lvov. These will be relatively low-yield tactical devices, none above 20 to 40 kilotons in yield. Even the Lvov bomb will be not exceed 100 kilotons. These missile strikes, coordinated with massive armored assaults in their wake, will kill, disorganize, and demoralize the enemy units. The Ukraine will be Russian, with very little collateral damage.  
Putin decides to push the nuclear button (“…but only a little,” he later says). The missiles are launched, and the attack goes much as planned. Within three days, his units are mopping up isolated pockets of resistance. The Ukraine is once again a part of Russia.  
International condemnation is quick and fierce, fueled by the civilian death toll in Lvov and the use of any nuclear weapons at all. Polish, Lithuanian, and U.S. critics add another important charge: the dead in Lvov include advisors from all three nations, there on NATO-sanctioned assignments. Their deaths are grounds for invoking Article 5. Russia has committed an act of war against the western alliance.  
The dead, radioactive bodies of the slain advisors are buried with pomp and ceremony. Tempers continue to run high in European capitals. NATO offers a diplomatic solution. Russia must remove her forces from the Ukraine. A plebiscite, conducted under U.N. supervision will be held to determine Ukrainian preferences, and Russia must agree to decontaminate and restore the nuclear strike sites.  
Russia refuses. Further, Putin states that the lands his nation has in the past allowed to behave “as though they were independent” must now return to Russian control. He lists Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, as well as land in Poland and Romania, as the territory demanded. His advisors are certain the NATO nations will step back from the brink. Victory is almost in sight.  
Stiffened by unwavering U.S. support, NATO responds by giving Russia twenty-four hours to comply with their solution, “after which time a state of war will exist …”  
The Russian military does not wait. Tanks cross the frontiers of the three Baltic republics and breach the Polish border as well. Again, tactical nuclear strikes are employed. Russian ballistic missiles strike Liverpool, Brussels, Tours, Turin, Bremen, and Philadelphia — with a warning that more will follow if NATO does not stand down and sue for immediate peace.  
Massive retaliation from U.S., British, and French nuclear submarines follows within minutes. All Russian intercontinental missile forces are targeted and hit. B2 stealth bombers refuel several times as they range over European Russia, looking for mobile ICBM batteries to destroy. Moscow, St. Petersburg, and every Russian city with a population of more than 20,000 is targeted and hit with at least one thermonuclear bomb. The Russian nuclear submarine fleet is destroyed and sunk in the Artic. Russia becomes a radioactive pile of slag, and suffers more than 100 million immediate casualties. Its oil and gas fields will burn for decades.  
Before they are destroyed, Russian ICBMs are able to target Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Seattle, Toronto, London, Paris, Milan, and 20 other large European and U.S. cities. Casualties among the NATO nations exceed 130 million.  
Western civilization has suffered a mortal blow. Hospitals do not exist to treat the millions of wounded, sick, and dying. Without food, transportation, and medical care, the cities of the world quickly begin to die. It is the beginning of a new dark age.  
Although the blackness of a full nuclear winter does not occur, enough debris has been thrown into the atmosphere to deepen the winters and shorten the summers for a decade to come. Many who survived the bombs will die from cold, hunger, and untreated disease.  
Fifty years later, the Chinese pioneers who venture into Europe and North America will wonder what the world would have been like without the Western Suicide War, as they wander through the silent ruins.",384b6944dde95bf2120e5c164c86a56b5868617c,True,False,,,,,0,1646057787,,0,{},hys2wmn,False,t3_t38s2k,False,True,t3_t38s2k,/r/war/comments/t38s2k/oddly_accurate_prediction_for_the_current/hys2wmn/,1646057803,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646028987.0,

Stiffened by unwavering U.S. support, NATO responds by giving Russia twenty-four hours to comply with their solution, “after which time a state of war will exist …”  
The Russian military does not wait. Tanks cross the frontiers of the three Baltic republics and breach the Polish border as well. Again, tactical nuclear strikes are employed. Russian ballistic missiles strike Liverpool, Brussels, Tours, Turin, Bremen, and Philadelphia — with a warning that more will follow if NATO does not stand down and sue for immediate peace.  
Massive retaliation from U.S., British, and French nuclear submarines follows within minutes. All Russian intercontinental missile forces are targeted and hit. B2 stealth bombers refuel several times as they range over European Russia, looking for mobile ICBM batteries to destroy. Moscow, St. Petersburg, and every Russian city with a population of more than 20,000 is targeted and hit with at least one thermonuclear bomb. The Russian nuclear submarine fleet is destroyed and sunk in the Artic. Russia becomes a radioactive pile of slag, and suffers more than 100 million immediate casualties. Its oil and gas fields will burn for decades.  
Before they are destroyed, Russian ICBMs are able to target Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Seattle, Toronto, London, Paris, Milan, and 20 other large European and U.S. cities. Casualties among the NATO nations exceed 130 million.  
Western civilization has suffered a mortal blow. Hospitals do not exist to treat the millions of wounded, sick, and dying. Without food, transportation, and medical care, the cities of the world quickly begin to die. It is the beginning of a new dark age.  
Although the blackness of a full nuclear winter does not occur, enough debris has been thrown into the atmosphere to deepen the winters and shorten the summers for a decade to come. Many who survived the bombs will die from cold, hunger, and untreated disease.  
Fifty years later, the Chinese pioneers who venture into Europe and North America will wonder what the world would have been like without the Western Suicide War, as they wander through the silent ruins.""",de230c137212e8d8cc142ce578bdab536f163e10,True,False,,,,,0,1646057732,,0,{},hys2sm7,False,t3_t38s2k,False,True,t3_t38s2k,/r/war/comments/t38s2k/oddly_accurate_prediction_for_the_current/hys2sm7/,1646057750,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646028932.0,

ALL THESE ARE AI MACHINES,

Im not being offensive to anyone but for English speaking countries, it is very very rare to find civilians interested in politics. If all. 

Just communicating with true civilians (not AI) you will find that no one knows what the f is happening or what the details are. All they know there is an invasion and fuel is going up. 

I used to think that people on subs that still posts things about chads and simps  and cringe are fools because the time is ending and they still wary about some first world problems.

But now i actually give them big respect for not participating. Both sides of media are fully manipulated now to a very very high degree on both sides.

573,[],False,,ArgosCyclos,,,[],,,,text,t2_jp5hehui,False,False,"I have pondered on this quite a lot. I think it's for a multitude of reasons. One being that society is tending towards a more liberal future (which I know seems like a scary thing, but it doesn't have to be.). Another, being that this country has been under the sole leadership of a single generation for 50ish years. Which means with each passing year less gets done, because these people are entrenched in doing for corporations not the people and to their own gain, not caring about the people because they know they'll win no matter what, and becoming older and incapable of understanding the kind of laws needed for a technological future. Because of that society is doing a correction (quickly becoming an overcorrection). And the last is that a whole section of society has wanted what were originally very reasonable changes, and those going unmet has driven people to the extremes of change. Including change for the sake of change.

The overcorrection is the particularly dangerous part. Because it's driving the other side to the extreme of wanting to do whatever is the opposite of that change as long as it keeps them from ruining what little good still exists. A common tactic nowadays is for the left politicians to have some grand idea (with the best of intent, regardless of the real world outcome), and then the right politicians will use their numbers to just make sure nothing gets done at all. One could argue indefinitely on who started the pendulum swinging further and further, but the reality is, it is the randomness of nature. So we will leave it to a ""chicken and the egg"" argument.

The solution is actually the opposite of what both sides think. It's the same solution that would work in just about every human conflict.... Come to the table! Don't go to war, skip that horrible step, and jump right to the part where you come to the table. In the case of the US, let's use healthcare as an example. If we sit down together, instead of refusing to acknowledge the viewpoint of the other, we will immediately find the clear starting point. Every American can agree that healthcare costs are far exceeding the actual value of that healthcare. This can be seen clearly when compared to pricing in nations with equivalent healthcare. That's a perfect starting point. It gives us so much room to work with. We could come up with a solution that is better than any other nation on the Earth.

I also think we need to cancel our own pundits. It's why I do not listen to Bill Maher or Rachel Maddow. And why I use applications that show news from all sides. As strange as it seems, I've even been reading Russian news during this conflict, and Indian news, and other sources. Putin is clearly in the wrong, but how can we solve this if we don't understand that intent, desires, and viewpoints of our opponents? How can we express to our opponents the best solution, if we don't understand what they need from the situation. I do the same with domestic politics. I go to a lot of effort to understand conservative Christians, and rural populations, and libertarians. I cannot expect our government to function in a way that is at the expense of those groups. Then I can work toward a solution that benefits both sides.",2d761473789f9b07a63fbbf84be83ac5c7c1ee99,True,False,,,,,0,1646042941,,0,{},hyrfki9,False,t3_t37ljm,False,True,t1_hyrduqu,/r/war/comments/t37ljm/what_russia_wants_from_its_invasion_of_ukraine/hyrfki9/,1646042953,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646014141.0,

To learn how to reload and manage ammunition effectively.   


Then they must also learn how to move. Maneuver as group to maximize firepower while minimizing the danger. From both enemy and friendly fire. Fighting alone is one thing, but to be able to fight together takes a non trivial amount of preparation and training.  


Then finally, they must know how to communicate. To coordinate efforts, and minimize mistakes. Mistaken identity is a very real possibility. There's already cases of both Ukrainians and Russians accidentally killing each other, since their equipment and vehicles are very similar.  


The old adage. Shoot, move, communicate.  


Soldier's must also learn accountability. Accountability for their actions, for the shots they take, and for each other.

Not sure what the goal is invading western Ukraine, as they’re putting up a hell of a fight and have military/supply backing from the west.  

Russia struck a deal with China that’ll financially support them through the sanctions, and most of their economy runs through organized crime anyways.  The sanctions will hurt Europe a lot as 40% of Europe’s energy comes from Russia, so Russia can do a lot of damage that way.  I don’t know how the west intends to deal with that.

People also talk about potential cyberattacks from Russia.

One thing I do know is that Biden is very unpopular right now and is likely to lose the next election, so Putin is probably waiting out for another Republican President and wants to stall any actions by Biden until that happens.  Biden is very invested in the Ukraine for whatever reason and has been pushing for it to join NATO.

So what is this “sword verse” about then?

Muslims tribe had a treaty with another pagan (note that its not about the Jews or Christians) tribe. However during the time of war the other tribe broke the treat and betrayed the Muslims and joined the attackers. Islam is not a pacifist religion. It allows the right to self defence. And that’s all that this verse is for about a particular time and a particular event in history. It also teaches that you must be forgiving if the enemy asks for asylum then forgive despite them having betrayed you. And that is how Muslims should live. Forgive when ever possible.

Ukraine needed fighters. And they fight hard. Many of them happen to be far right wing extremists.    


Ukraine isn't perfect of course. So far they banned men from leaving the country, lowered the enlistment age, and handed out tons of military hardware to the general population, pretty much no questions asked. And called to arms anyone able enough to throw a molotov or shoot a rifle to fight.  


Of course, to the West, in any other situation, these tings would seem like a violation of our personal freedoms. But the freedom and entire existence of their country is on the line, so they and the world have pretty much accepted it. A justifiable means to an end.  


Anyway, on the note of Chechen forces.

I cannot reconcile why they keep portraying the Russian military as getting their asses kicked easily (despite the maps showing otherwise) with the way the West usually behaves. 

Usually, they overstate and exaggerate the capabilities of the enemy so has to make it easier to derive funding and support. Think of every ragtag Jihadi group of the last 20 years. Oddly, they’re doing the exact opposite with Russia. Instead of portraying them as a military power to be feared, they are portraying Russia as a disunited and inept military led by a singular tyrant. 

I’m starting to be scared that they will try to justify NATO getting directly involved by bolstering the belief (among Western citizenries) that the Russians are inept and easily defeated.

Russia made three very big mistakes.

First, they drastically underestimated the determination of Ukrainian resistance.  Drastically.

Second, Russia underestimated the impact that the many thousands of western weapons would have.  Javalins, NLAWs, and MANPADs have completely eliminated any advantage Russia possessed.

Lastly, it attempted to take the whole country at once.  It divided it's forces into many smaller armies all set to take separate cities.  The second they encountered resistance, the war was lost.  They left with enough fuel to make it directly to the cities and little more.  The second their forces began getting delayed due to Ukrainian resistance...... those tanks, APCs, and support vehicles began wasting what precious little fuel they had.  At that point, failure became inevitable.

So now, to save face, Putin appears to be throwing those remaining support forces at the capital in the hopes of pulling off a miracle...... it's again to losing badly in an RTS video game and abandoning your bases and strategy to make one last push at the enemy....

Do you know what the coat of arms of rurik was??? 

[Trident (tryzub). The official coat of arms of Ukraine is a gold trident on an azure background (see Coat of arms of Ukraine of 1992). As a state emblem the trident dates back to Kyivan Rus’, when it was the coat of arms of the Riurykide dynasty.](http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CT%5CR%5CTrident.htm)

That’s waayyy before Novgorod or any famous russian cities.

The oldest examples of the trident discovered by archeologists on Ukrainian territory date back to the 1st century AD. At that time the trident probably served as a symbol of power in one of the tribes that later became part of the Ukrainian people.

The thing whit what you say about the toponym of Russia is that, no, Russia does not originate from the Russian language, I’m sorry, it’s an exonym from the Norse culture that presumably migrated and assimilated local cultures; EXONYM: just as España comes from a Phoenician word, Estambul comes from a Greek phrase and many other cities and villages in Europe receive their names from other languages. This case is just a coincidence between similar words.

Yes, Rus comes from Kiev, but also from many other cities and population centers between Dnieper and the Caspian Sea, they called themselves the Ros, a multicultural group of people that originated from migration and assimilation, you can read it on the fucking Wikipedia page Jesus. If you want I can research it in the bibliography of my college but I don’t think I’ll change your mind tbh. And please, don’t post Ukrainian or Russian news posts as source, they tend to be (like all countries) very paternalistic with history and tend to misunderstand real events and people, just mediatic propaganda.

Of course Kiev was a developed centre before Moscow, because Moscow wasn’t really important until 18th century… You’d have to look at cities like Novgorod or Smolensk to see big activity in the area in the late Middle Ages… BUT, what about this: [Russkaya Pravda or Rus' Justice (Rus' Justice or Rus' Truth;[2][3] Old East Slavic: Правда роусьскаꙗ, Pravda Rusĭskaya (13th century, 1280),[4][5] Правда Руськая, Pravda Rus'kaya (second half of the 15th century);[6][7] Russian: Русская правда, Russkaya Pravda; Ukrainian: Руська Правда, Rus'ka Pravda) was the legal code of Kievan Rus' and the subsequent Rus' principalities during the times of feudal division. It was written at the beginning of the 12th century and remade during many centuries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russkaya_Pravda). A legal code, written by princes of the Rus, in Kiev… calling it Russkaya Pravda??? Isn’t that the name we are discussing about? Of course, modern Russian state is not based on Kiev nowadays, populations move, and it would be stupid to think that Kiev was always Ukrainian… Btw, it wasn’t the name of a human group until much later: [The oldest recorded mention of the word ukraina dates back to the year 1187. In connection with the death of Volodymyr Hlibovych [uk], the ruler of the Principality of Pereyaslavl which was Kyiv's southern shield against the Wild Fields, the Hypatian Codex says ""Oukraina groaned for him"", ѡ нем же Оукраина много постона[5] (o nem že Oukraina mnogo postona).[6] In the following decades and centuries this term was applied to fortified borderlands of different principalities of Rus' without a specific geographic fixation: Halych-Volhynia, Pskov, Ryazan etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Ukraine) basically: Ukraine didn’t start as the name of a culture, but as a designation of the borderlands of the reforming feudal governments present in the area. Sry to disappoint, maybe you won’t even try to understand, but it is what it is: we had to wait until 1500s to call ourselves Spain so… 
And of course development was much faster in the Kiev area than in the Moscovite and Novgorod area, geography is the cause, but that isn’t proof of a state or culture… it proves that Kiev is closer to Central Europe and Byzantium and could develop faster, while Moscow couldn’t. But please don’t fail to understand that Kiev doesn’t mean Ukraine as Moscow in 400 would have been a sclavenian emplacement, not Russian…",05286203ae1219514b78d91214b82b3d019d04cd,True,True,,,,,0,1646001866,,0,{},hypcjc2,False,t3_t2sxw0,False,True,t1_hyp4ewc,/r/war/comments/t2sxw0/besides_the_misinformation_title_and_top_comments/hypcjc2/,1646001878,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1645973066.0,

They are slavs, same race, culturally same approximately.  They are neighbors , they have had good relations years ago , and based on this conditions Putin didnt want to show the wildest way of making war , based on my perception, maybe im wrong about the similarities i mention .

Putin didnt count will be such a tought resistance ,counting he had a lot of suporters ,intels , arrangnents to make the invading much smoother , thats why he might didnt want to show the real strength.

In terms of military strength , the world is bipolar. Russia and Usa ,nobody else can compare with these to states.
I think if the war wouldnt be with Ukraine but with another state, we could see another kind of response, much toughter , much devastating in all terms.

I havent seen till now any modern equipment in use from invader .  Only guns , old tanks , a few fighter jets, a few Bm-21. Nothing sophisticated from such a big wolf on this planet (from what i have seen in media,and my perception)even though real war isnt on camera.

Even Russian soilders in my eyes doesnt look prepared for war , they dont know where they are ,looks unorganized, low morale making me think they are new military recruiters . I see even Putin looks doesnt care at all about his own soilders (heartless) ,make me think ""the real soilders he have in Russia yet. 

My fear is ,going this way with such resistance, with such losses in the eye of the world the perception of this military power is changing and in the eyes of the world russia might see it necessary to shows everybody the real strength and potential, to prove it might throw sophisticated attacks with bigger bombs .

Ukraininan army have to deal with the enemy coming from outside , even with the enemy(ukrainian citinzens pro russian) they have inside too, such a tough job to do.

Ukrainian consul in Germany received birthday cake in form of ""Main Kampf"" from his colleagues and then had picture of it published by Ukrainian Foreign Ministry in a book.

*1.  (C) Summary.  Following a muted first reaction to Ukraine's intent to seek a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) at the Bucharest summit (ref A), Foreign Minister Lavrov and other senior officials have reiterated strong opposition, stressing that Russia would view further eastward expansion as a potential military threat.  NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine, remains ""an emotional and neuralgic"" issue for Russia, but strategic policy considerations also underlie strong opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia.  In Ukraine, these include fears that the issue could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.  Additionally, the GOR and experts continue to claim that Ukrainian NATO membership would have a major impact on Russia's defense industry, Russian-Ukrainian family connections, and bilateral relations generally.  In Georgia, the GOR fears continued instability and ""provocative acts"" in the separatist regions.

There is an order to the russian solders to minimize the civilian loses as much as possible. The civilians will die, it's a war, but no unlimited artillery and thermobaric usage from the russians in the civilian areas so far.

This is from your own link: Originally, the name Rus' (Cyrillic: Русь) referred to the people,[1] regions, and medieval states (9th to 12th centuries) of the Kievan Rus'. 

So the word Rus originated from Kiev?? 

[originally the name of a group of Swedish merchant/warriors who established themselves around Kiev](https://www.etymonline.com/word/russia)

[For the first time Ukraine was mentioned in the Hypatian Chronicle. Not Little Rus’ or something else, but Ukraine. Nobody heard about Moscow and Russia at that time.](https://uapost.us/en/blog/in-12th-century-the-land-is-first-mentioned-as-ukraine-russia-does-not-exist/)

What historical data will help to clarify Ukraine and Russia backgrounds.
Higher education institutions: the Russian Academy of Sciences was founded in 1724, Moscow University in 1755. Ostroh Academy was founded in 1576 in Ukraine, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was established in 1615 and Lviv University in 1661.
First printed ABC book in Ukraine was published in 1574 in Lviv, and in the Tsardom of Russia it happened 60 years later in 1634.

Religion: Kyiv Metropolia was founded in the year 988, and Moscow Patriarchate only in 1458. Kyiv Metropolia is 460 years older than Moscow ones.
Capitals: Kyiv is one among the oldest cities in Europe and was founded in 482, while Moscow was founded in 1147 by Yuriy Dolgoruky, the son of Volodymyr Monomakh. So, Kyiv is older than Moscow by 665 years.
The first monarch who was crowned in the Tsardom of Russia was Ivan the Terrible in 1547, and in Ukrainian lands it was the first king of Rus’ Daniel of Galicia in 1253.",3bec3d5c1ae4cb7cf14e757c09ce513bfeea47c4,True,False,,,,,0,1645998517,,0,{},hyp4ewc,False,t3_t2sxw0,False,True,t1_hyp2565,/r/war/comments/t2sxw0/besides_the_misinformation_title_and_top_comments/hyp4ewc/,1645998534,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1645969717.0,

Btw DOES NOT come from sowing:[The most common theory about the origins of Russians is the germanic version. The name Rus', like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (*Ruotsi), supposed to be descended from an Old Norse term for ""the men who row"" (rods-) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (Rus-law) or Roden, as it was known in earlier times.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Rus%27,_Russia_and_Ruthenia#Etymology)

How come Donetsk and Luhansk never wanted to be a part of Russia before 2014?? Nobody even had those thoughts there back then. 

Australia and England are a completely different story. Ukraine existed way before Russia. Russia derived from Ukraine. 

[15th century The modern name of Russia (Rossija), which came into use in the 15th century, is derived from the Greek Ρωσία, which in turn derives from Ῥῶς, the self-name of the people of Rus'.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Rus%27,_Russia_and_Ruthenia)


[Вкраїна Vkrayina [u̯krɐˈjinɐ]) was first used in reference to a part of the territory of Kievan Rus' in the 12th century. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the 12th century, referring to numerous lands on the border between Poland and Kievan Rus' or its successor states.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Ukraine)

I do not believe that Putin would push the button first. I’ve been through times when the conflict was much hotter, the arms race in full swing, and that button did not get pushed.

But I *am* aware of the intense psychological burden the nuclear conflict places upon one’s mind, particularly in the minds of young people such as yourself. I’m aware of the existential fear that the Cold War placed upon generations during the mid 20th century, right up until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. It was palpable.

My country is a defense contractor. We’ve many conflicted feelings about this. There is no ethical way to be an arms dealer, or a global hegemon. But my country is avowed in defense of your own. We are NATO, we are allies, and we owe Italy our promise in that.

You are merely fifteen. I am sixty-five. You were born long after the Cold War and even after the World Trade Center attacks of 9/11/2001, which ushered in the “War on Terror”. I’ve seen a lot of geopolitical conflict in my 56 years. Truly frightening thoughts, and even though the US is a sort of “fortress across the ocean”, that actually makes us a powerfully protected ally. We are in this together.

As for bunkers, well… we’ve been there too. Don’t worry too much. You’ve a lot of living yet to do and as a beloved friend of mine once told me: *Nothing is the End of the World, except the End of the World”.*

Much of the populace reacted quite negatively to this news and protested, and now Germany decided to finally supply Ukraine with Panzerfausts and Stingers, as well as to support kicking Russia off SWIFT.

Completely unrelated. If I shoot 2 birds from revolver and 1 from shogun, it does not mean that shotguns are ineffective against birds.

Incorrect. That why there were 0 tanks destroyed by Bazookas during November 1942  - May 1943 and just 6% of all British/American tank casualties in Normandy were due to Panzerfausts. Early models were just not capable of penetrating heavier armour and did not have the range as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's incorrect. Bazooka or Panzerfaust use hollow charge warheads, they don't depend on kinetic energy to penetrate. They will penetrate the exact same thickness of armor at range 0 as at 1000.

Incorrect again. Bazookas/Panzerfausts require penetration - thats why US/British tanks added extra armour in form of sand bags ect. If the Panzerfaust was as effective as you claim the Germans would have won the war because they produced 6-8 Million of them.
