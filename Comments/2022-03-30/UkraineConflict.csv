&gt;Event: A small group of German bombers miss their intended night-time target and accidentally drop their bombs on London, destroying homes and killing British citizens.  
&gt;  
&gt;Impact: Air superiority was a prerequisite for invading Britain. Without it, an invading force would be vulnerable to British air and naval power. In an attempt to achieve superiority, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had concentrated its airpower during the early stages of the Battle of Britain against the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Germans were on the cusp of defeating the RAF and ruling the skies when the accidental bombing of London occurred. Up to that point in the war, a tacit ‘gentleman’s agreement’ had existed between Britain and Germany that civilian targets were off limits to bombing raids, especially targets in each other’s capitals. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill interpreted this unintentional bombing of the capital as a deliberate strike against defenceless civilians and, in reprisal, ordered a series of bomber attacks against Berlin. Enraged, Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to switch from their successful attacks against RAF airfields and facilities and conduct a ‘Blitz’ bombing of London and other British cities. While ‘the Blitz’ resulted in tens of thousands of British civilian casualties and vast destruction, from a military perspective, the purely revenge attacks relieved the pressure on the RAF and allowed it to recover. Not only did the Germans lose the Battle of Britain, but they were prevented from invading Britain, and Britain subsequently became the essential platform for massive unrestricted aerial bombing of Germany and for the Allied invasion of Europe.

,[],False,,History_Anon,,,[],,,,text,t2_id4vlmc1,False,False,"Your all ready for the Ukrainian victory parade in Kiev, over the news about Russia’s “strategic shift”, you might want to re-familiarize yourself with basic military concepts. Maneuver warfare is a good place to start. Understand Russia started its “special military operation” with a severe manpower deficit—200,000 attackers to some 600,000 defenders (or more). Classic attritional conflict was never an option. Russian victory required maneuver. Maneuver war is more psychological than physical and focuses more on the operational than on the tactical level. Maneuver is relational movement—how you deploy and move your forces in relation to your opponent. Russian maneuver in the first phase of its operation support this. The Russians needed to shape the battlefield to their advantage. In order to do this, they needed to control how Ukraine employed it’s numerically superior forces, while distributing their own smaller combat power to best accomplish this objective. Strategically, to facilitate the ability to maneuver between the southern, central, and northern fronts, Russia needed to secure a land bridge between Crimea and Russia. The seizure of the coastal city of Mariupol was critical to this effort. Russia has accomplished this task. While this complex operation unfolded, Russia needed to keep Ukraine from maneuvering its numerically superior forces in a manner that disrupted the Mariupol operation. This entailed the use of several strategic supporting operations—feints, fixing operations, and deep attack. The concept of a feint is simple—a military force either is seen as preparing to attack a given location, or actually conducts an attack, for the purpose of deceiving an opponent into committing resources in response to the perceived or actual actions. The use of the feint played a major role in Desert Storm, where Marine Amphibious forces threatened the Kuwaiti coast, forcing Iraq to defend against an attack that never came, and where the 1st Cavalry Division actually attacked Wadi Al Batin to pin down the Republican Guard. The Russians made extensive use of the feint in Ukraine, with Amphibious forces off Odessa freezing Ukrainian forces there, and a major feint attack toward Kiev compelling Ukraine to reinforce their forces there. Ukraine was never able to reinforce their forces in the east. Fixing operations were also critical. Ukraine had assembled some 60,000-100,000 troops in the east, opposite Donbas. Russia carried out a broad fixing attack designed to keep these forces fully engaged and unable to maneuver in respect to other Russian operations. During Desert Storm, two Marine Divisions were ordered to carry out similar fixing attacks against Iraqi forces deployed along the Kuwaiti-Saudi border, tying down significant numbers of men and material that could not be used to counter the main US attack out west. The Russian fixing attack pinned the main Ukrainian concentration of forces in the east, and drove them away from Mariupol, which was invested and reduced. Supporting operations out of Crimea against Kherson expanded the Russian land bridge. This phase is now complete. Russia also engaged in a campaign of strategic deep attack designed to disrupt and destroy Ukrainian logistics, command &amp; control, and air power and long-range fire support. Ukraine is running out of fuel and ammo, cannot coordinate maneuver, and has no meaningful Air Force. Russia is redeploying some of its premier units from where they had been engaged in feint operations in northern Kiev to where they can support the next phase of the operation, namely the liberation of the Donbas and the destruction of the main Ukrainian force in the east. This is classic maneuver warfare. Russia will now hold Ukraine in the north and south while its main forces, reinforced by the northern units, Marines, and forces freed up by the capture of Mariupol, seek to envelope and destroy 60,000 Ukrainian forces in the east. This is Big Arrow War at its finest, something Americans used to know but forgot in the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan and Iraq. It also explains how 200,000 Russians have been able to defeat 600,000 Ukrainians. Thus ends the primer on maneuver warfare, Russian style.",fb012aa7659e216701f3147a00a9743e1efe811d,True,False,,,,,0,1648613881,,0,{},i2oc9hc,False,t3_tqsxav,False,True,t1_i2obag9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tqsxav/face_to_face_meeting_was_constructive/i2oc9hc/,1648613899,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648585081.0,,,,

&gt; A Ukrainian soldier who told an officer on a Russian warship to &amp;quot;Go fuck yourself&amp;quot; at the start of the invasion has been released as part of a prisoner exchange, and awarded a medal for his services, the Ukrainian ministry of defence said on Tuesday.

&gt; Initial reports said 13 border guards on the island had died after refusing to surrender, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine saying each guard would be posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine.

So, Trump basically followed a line already agreed. He might be much more vocal about it, and called out the other NATO allies on the subject in a very showy way, but that’s about it.

As for Trump just pull US out of NATO, it’s not that simple, since it’s not like pulling out of e.g. the Paris climate agreement. But, his ongoing digs at NATO, questioning its relevance for US certainly could undermine NATO’s reputation among republican woters and hence ultimatly make it more attractive for Republican lawmakers to make the actual withdrawal happen.

Multiple sources, citing e.g. Esper, Bolton and Mattis point to Trump’s intention of abolishing NATO, and litterally today Trump called for Putin to help him find dirt on Hunter Biden. 

Almost at the same time Russian state TV have a segment where Russian pundits Call for an American regime shift to get Trump back. Isn’t that just an interesting coincident…

**The UK has proposed strengthening the G7 — but the EU appears more comfortable with the status quo.**

LONDON — Western allies have presented a united front against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but they’ve hit a familiar stumbling block in deciding the best forum to coordinate sanctions — disagreement between Brussels and London.

After doling out a series of measures meant to punish Moscow over the past month, the European Union, United States and the United Kingdom are now trying to work out the best way to formally synchronize these penalties going forward.

While the EU seems comfortable with the ad hoc status quo, the U.K. has floated the notion of bulking up the G7 group of wealthy democracies to make that the main forum for such discussions, giving it a secretariat to make it more similar to other international organizations such as NATO.

U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a new “sanctions dialogue” to streamline coordination on Tuesday after visiting both London and Brussels, but did not offer details on Washington’s preferred method for holding such talks. U.S. President Joe Biden first mentioned such a plan after a NATO summit in Brussels last week, saying allies had discussed creating an organization to ensure compliance with the sanctions, tackle any loopholes and look “at who has violated any of the sanctions, and where and when and how they violated them.”

On Tuesday, Adeyemo made it clear that cooperation on sanctions involves more players than just the 27 governments in the EU when he told an event in London that “more than 30 partners and allies” have formed a “coalition in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”

For London, the natural home for discussions on further sanctions is the G7, which includes the U.K., U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told a U.K. parliamentary committee in early March that the G7 has been “instrumental” in coordinating sanctions against Russia, saying the war “demonstrates the importance of working with our allies, including non-democracies.”",20774cb7313d9851d9ee643d2b007da553b883fc,True,False,,,,,0,1648677144,,0,{},i2rqvad,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t3_tsk6z3,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqvad/,1648677163,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648344.0,,,,

She has previously advocated forming a “network of liberty” with partners that share strong trade and security ties, even if they are not liberal democracies.

“It is very important for us to build that very strong network with the G7,” Truss told MPs. “I think we can do more to strengthen the G7 and give it a more permanent footing.”

Observers see in her idea an evolution of the so-called D10 concept — an expanded version of the G7 including Australia, India and South Korea, first pitched by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2020.

But the British proposal does not have much support in continental Europe, according to an EU diplomat. EU leaders believe the G7 has allowed them to have frank discussions on sensitive security matters, but are reluctant to introduce any changes that may make it more vulnerable to pressure from civil servants or others, the diplomat said.

Johnson’s pitch for a D10 rather than a G7 “died” at the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, last summer, amid concerns it would be perceived as an anti-China club, the envoy said, adding that attempts to float this idea again will not succeed despite the radical change in circumstances posed by the war in Ukraine.

“It would create more problems than solutions,” the diplomat said, pointing to China’s likely opposition to India joining the group. “We need to play with what we’ve got.”

One EU official suggested the U.K.’s desire to strengthen the G7 stems from its feelings of isolation post Brexit.

“The U.K. is hugely frustrated as they have very little impact on the sanctions packages, so I understand they want to work more via the G7,” the official said. “They are the fifth wheel on the wagon. It’s mostly between the EU and the U.S. The sanctions are such a balancing act within the EU that it’s mostly up to others to align with us once we [are] agreed on internally.”

Others on the Continent suggest allies could create a “committee for sanctions” connected to NATO, arguing the transatlantic military alliance represents the majority of governments involved in those discussions.",1c7a33cac1fa7d7c9423133b687703bb872f9e97,True,False,,,,,0,1648677154,,0,{},i2rqw5k,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqvad,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqw5k/,1648677171,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648354.0,,,,

However, this option presents the same problem as the expanded G7 proposal: There are six EU countries that have sanctioned Russia that are not members of NATO, nor are Japan and Switzerland, among others. Opponents counter that it would be odd to link economic sanctions with a security alliance.

EU ambassadors have not yet discussed options for more structured cooperation on sanctions, and many feel current coordination efforts with the U.S. are working well. Brussels and Washington are also already trying to meet regularly under the auspices of the Trade and Technology Council, launched in June, with another meeting expected to take place in Paris in May.

Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial services, said Tuesday the EU and the U.S. are in “lock-step” on sanctions, and that the key was “to ensure effective and full implementation of sanctions across jurisdictions.”

“We will continue to coordinate our response with the strongest determination and unity. And we are fully committed to strengthening our close cooperation on sanctions and sharing information with our U.S. and other partners,” McGuinness said.

Robin Niblett, director of the London-based Chatham House foreign affairs think tank, said many international sanctions agreed before Brexit relied on exclusive information shared by Britain, so it would be counterproductive for the EU to try to sideline the U.K. from key discussions on this topic.

“It doesn’t surprise me that some EU governments and the European Commission definitely would rather not have the G7 in the middle of this because of course that reduces their power and their clout vis-à-vis with the U.S., and they get mixed up with Canada, the U.K. and Japan, and then they are not in the driving seat,” Niblett said.",1c4206f74635941d8203de4ec2186b85de513fc9,True,False,,,,,0,1648677162,,0,{},i2rqwvr,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqw5k,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqwvr/,1648677175,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648362.0,,,,

He added there is still merit in an expanded G7 and while Johnson’s “insistence on including India” could create gridlock, Australia and South Korea would be “logical joiners.”

The G7, or an expanded version of it, could also invite countries such as South Korea and Switzerland to attend discussions on sanctions on an ad hoc basis, even if they refuse to join the organization formally, he said.

“Using NATO runs the risk of making this an extension of military action and looks too much like ‘the West,’” he said. “G7 would be better — it has the U.S. and the EU in it, as well as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Japan. And it can be enlarged as the Carbis Bay summit was. Even without a formal secretariat, the existing G7 is the logical forum.

“I don’t see a problem, as long as you don’t call it a number … Whenever the prime minister has tried to go for a catchy title like D10, he’s got himself into terrible trouble because then you do exclude a whole bunch of countries.”

Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who chairs the House of Commons defense select committee, supported the idea of opening up the G7 to new members as a way to fight for “stronger standards and values” and begin to “rebuild the foundations” of international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, which he said is not functioning as it was intended.",0ede374a2c4779515352779342a13adbb21f007c,True,False,,,,,0,1648677168,,0,{},i2rqxgz,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqwvr,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqxgz/,1648677184,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648368.0,,,,
