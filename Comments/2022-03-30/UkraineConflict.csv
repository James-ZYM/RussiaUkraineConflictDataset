&gt; A Ukrainian soldier who told an officer on a Russian warship to &amp;quot;Go fuck yourself&amp;quot; at the start of the invasion has been released as part of a prisoner exchange, and awarded a medal for his services, the Ukrainian ministry of defence said on Tuesday.

&gt; Initial reports said 13 border guards on the island had died after refusing to surrender, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine saying each guard would be posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine.

[],False,,History_Anon,,,[],,,,text,t2_id4vlmc1,False,False,"Your all ready for the Ukrainian victory parade in Kiev, over the news about Russia’s “strategic shift”, you might want to re-familiarize yourself with basic military concepts. Maneuver warfare is a good place to start. Understand Russia started its “special military operation” with a severe manpower deficit—200,000 attackers to some 600,000 defenders (or more). Classic attritional conflict was never an option. Russian victory required maneuver. Maneuver war is more psychological than physical and focuses more on the operational than on the tactical level. Maneuver is relational movement—how you deploy and move your forces in relation to your opponent. Russian maneuver in the first phase of its operation support this. The Russians needed to shape the battlefield to their advantage. In order to do this, they needed to control how Ukraine employed it’s numerically superior forces, while distributing their own smaller combat power to best accomplish this objective. Strategically, to facilitate the ability to maneuver between the southern, central, and northern fronts, Russia needed to secure a land bridge between Crimea and Russia. The seizure of the coastal city of Mariupol was critical to this effort. Russia has accomplished this task. While this complex operation unfolded, Russia needed to keep Ukraine from maneuvering its numerically superior forces in a manner that disrupted the Mariupol operation. This entailed the use of several strategic supporting operations—feints, fixing operations, and deep attack. The concept of a feint is simple—a military force either is seen as preparing to attack a given location, or actually conducts an attack, for the purpose of deceiving an opponent into committing resources in response to the perceived or actual actions. The use of the feint played a major role in Desert Storm, where Marine Amphibious forces threatened the Kuwaiti coast, forcing Iraq to defend against an attack that never came, and where the 1st Cavalry Division actually attacked Wadi Al Batin to pin down the Republican Guard. The Russians made extensive use of the feint in Ukraine, with Amphibious forces off Odessa freezing Ukrainian forces there, and a major feint attack toward Kiev compelling Ukraine to reinforce their forces there. Ukraine was never able to reinforce their forces in the east. Fixing operations were also critical. Ukraine had assembled some 60,000-100,000 troops in the east, opposite Donbas. Russia carried out a broad fixing attack designed to keep these forces fully engaged and unable to maneuver in respect to other Russian operations. During Desert Storm, two Marine Divisions were ordered to carry out similar fixing attacks against Iraqi forces deployed along the Kuwaiti-Saudi border, tying down significant numbers of men and material that could not be used to counter the main US attack out west. The Russian fixing attack pinned the main Ukrainian concentration of forces in the east, and drove them away from Mariupol, which was invested and reduced. Supporting operations out of Crimea against Kherson expanded the Russian land bridge. This phase is now complete. Russia also engaged in a campaign of strategic deep attack designed to disrupt and destroy Ukrainian logistics, command &amp; control, and air power and long-range fire support. Ukraine is running out of fuel and ammo, cannot coordinate maneuver, and has no meaningful Air Force. Russia is redeploying some of its premier units from where they had been engaged in feint operations in northern Kiev to where they can support the next phase of the operation, namely the liberation of the Donbas and the destruction of the main Ukrainian force in the east. This is classic maneuver warfare. Russia will now hold Ukraine in the north and south while its main forces, reinforced by the northern units, Marines, and forces freed up by the capture of Mariupol, seek to envelope and destroy 60,000 Ukrainian forces in the east. This is Big Arrow War at its finest, something Americans used to know but forgot in the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan and Iraq. It also explains how 200,000 Russians have been able to defeat 600,000 Ukrainians. Thus ends the primer on maneuver warfare, Russian style.",fb012aa7659e216701f3147a00a9743e1efe811d,True,False,,,,,0,1648613881,,0,{},i2oc9hc,False,t3_tqsxav,False,True,t1_i2obag9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tqsxav/face_to_face_meeting_was_constructive/i2oc9hc/,1648613899,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648585081.0

[],False,,MarshalThornton,,,[],,,,text,t2_17gsix,False,False,"Interestingly enough, a somewhat similar event ended up being crucial to the Battle of Britain:

&gt;Event: A small group of German bombers miss their intended night-time target and accidentally drop their bombs on London, destroying homes and killing British citizens.  
&gt;  
&gt;Impact: Air superiority was a prerequisite for invading Britain. Without it, an invading force would be vulnerable to British air and naval power. In an attempt to achieve superiority, the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had concentrated its airpower during the early stages of the Battle of Britain against the Royal Air Force (RAF). The Germans were on the cusp of defeating the RAF and ruling the skies when the accidental bombing of London occurred. Up to that point in the war, a tacit ‘gentleman’s agreement’ had existed between Britain and Germany that civilian targets were off limits to bombing raids, especially targets in each other’s capitals. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill interpreted this unintentional bombing of the capital as a deliberate strike against defenceless civilians and, in reprisal, ordered a series of bomber attacks against Berlin. Enraged, Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to switch from their successful attacks against RAF airfields and facilities and conduct a ‘Blitz’ bombing of London and other British cities. While ‘the Blitz’ resulted in tens of thousands of British civilian casualties and vast destruction, from a military perspective, the purely revenge attacks relieved the pressure on the RAF and allowed it to recover. Not only did the Germans lose the Battle of Britain, but they were prevented from invading Britain, and Britain subsequently became the essential platform for massive unrestricted aerial bombing of Germany and for the Allied invasion of Europe.

All I can find is opinion pieces that have it in a headline but if you read it they essentially say 'he didn't say it specifically in this instance therefor I am going to assume he's against it'.

He has definitely been hard on NATO. I could go as far as seeing him bluff and make claims about backing out if other countries don't pick up their end of the agreement. Whether that would be right or wrong, I don't know. Certainly bad optics, as it would be more of a ""business style"" move rather then a presidential or political move.

But in all honesty, if you exclude the US, when he took office there was only 2 countries out of the remaining 29 that were actually meeting their obligations. Its not fair for the US taxpayers to shoulder that burden.

It would never happen (because MERICA). But if the left wants to reallocate miliary spending to social programs like healthcare etc, the best way to justify it is if the other NATO countries pick up the slack and fulfill their end of the agreement.

However, Putin IS a war criminal, he has planned and directed his forces in an international war crime, the crime of aggression, and has used war crimes, crimes against humanity and probably genocide to achieve his aims.  So call him a War Criminal.

How can calling him out for what he is be damaging to relationships when Putin as lied to the international community, the UN, and has used his appointed higher ranking officers to lie to the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.  He loses to his own people.  How can one negotiate with such an outright criminal? It's like the police negotiating with a murderer while the corpses of his victims are still warm and he's pulling the knife out!

So the likes of Macron - who think Bidden has made relationships more difficult.  There is no relationship - other than force - that is all Putin understands - brute overwhelming force - so I suggest that is the means of negotiation until the Russian people can find a ""clean skin' to bring this to an end and negotiate peace.

P.S.  Ukraine would be duped to accept a peace that suits others, especially those nations who want an end to the war to solve self-interest (rule supplies from Russia) and elections at home.
