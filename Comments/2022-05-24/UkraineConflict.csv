AHAHAH, you are crazy. Go ask vietnamese, latin americans (not migrants), arabs, serbs, lybians what do the think of you. 

You think others have different opinion? You think everyone is blind and doesn't notice your methods and so on?

States are quiet because of military threats and money flow. When first or second (or both) disappear - they'll change their position.

Maybe we are unpopular in USA-related media, but you are unpopular in reality.

&gt; Ukraine doesn't want to be Russian don't you get that?

Let's see how much pro-russian president Yanukovich (whom you violently threw away) had on last fair elections - [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Ukraine\_ElectionsMap\_2010-2\_Yanukovich.svg/1280px-Ukraine\_ElectionsMap\_2010-2\_Yanukovich.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Ukraine_ElectionsMap_2010-2_Yanukovich.svg/1280px-Ukraine_ElectionsMap_2010-2_Yanukovich.svg.png) 

Don't you get that? (C)

&gt;They wouldn't have any war if not for you.

You pushed them to war, that's obvious as day. USA didn't even want to make Ukraine its' ally, it wanted them to have war with Russia, to make slavs kill each other. Pretty much like you did in Afghanistan. It sort of backfired, but you aren't afraid of russian tricks, right?

&gt;But NEVER have we had a Putin, Stalin, Hitler figure. You have them all the time it would seem. 

You are really retarded if you put these 3 in one line. I'm not surprised you are american, you have no idea of literally anything. Nor about communism (Stalin), nor about anti-communism aka fascism (Hitler) both of which were created as a result of capitalistic crysis 1900+. Putin has nothing to do with both btw.

Go to university please. Or community college, or where is it possible in USA to become literate?

&gt;The Baltics moved into NATO. Why is that? 

Because they are in US-influence sphere. NATO is just a cover for economic ties, a guarantee for relationship. 

&gt;It certainly isn't because they were scared of NATO

Like they were asked, cmon, Estonia and Latvia are together like 3 millions. After years of antirussian brainwashing - of course they joined. Now both countries are dying states, living on EU funding, but who cares :) We'll see what happens to them in 100 years.

&gt;Your history and reputation precede you.

Are you aware that Russia gave stateness to Latvia and Estonia, yes? :) 

To be honest I don't expect you to know anything about society or history. Because ""your history and reputation precede you.""

&gt;Again, you never speak of anything I ask you?

You mostly speak nonsense, how am I supposed to discuss that?

&gt;We are going down this path, and it's going to blow up in all of your faces, and the west. You ALL are to blame. Regular citizens just want to live and raise families but you feel the need to subjugate your neighbors.

Again, you talk idealistic nonsense, like ignorant 15yo kid. NATO wants to live and raise families but for some reason brings missiles and radars to our borders? Sends fighter jets and ships like Defender in our space? 

You are exactly the problem you talk about - go and protest your government (until they put you in some Guantanomo). We only respond. 

We agreed on sovereign neutral unarmed Ukraine - you dragged them in military union and militarized. That's a fact! That's a reality! Hello, wake up! 

Does someone discuss that in your media? Tucker Carlson 5 minutes a week and that's all? Maybe someone in active government or parlament? No, only retired Kissinger in Davos.

You provoked this war and try to shift guilty on us. Okay that might work for some months, maybe few years, but after that propaganda bubble will blow up. In terms of political result you'll get new Vietnam, my congratulations.

You haven't won a single war since ww2, am I right? You've only brought destruction and misery, this will be yet another failure. Not impressive, even compared to 3 Putin successes.

&gt;Why would they? For what?

For resources, for influence, for money, for military companies interests - for whatever you launch these invasions for.

Cmon, you've destroyed one of the most ancient civilizations using a glass with white powder and 3d model of a truck. And with no realistic reason. Nobody trusts such world order anymore and nobody trusts USA specifically. 

Just look what a joke of a country you became - demented pedo-grandpa who handshakes air, ignites a war in Ukraine where he and his friends laundered money while his son doped fucked his cousin. Country where president gets banned from his main social media, country where most elites come to billionaire island for sex-trafficiking (and of course he kills himself), country which never punished its' own criminals (and even made a Hague law so that international laws won't work on it) but at the same time gave 175 years to Assange for speaking truth about different crimes including war crimes. Or Snowden, who has exposed huge international violations of human rights - but you don't care about them. Bush and his war on terror, Powell and his lies - all are respected members of society. Your country are these hawks in marasmus, while Coca-cola, coke, Kardashians and Marvels distract you from peeing in bottle on Amazon job. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!

&gt;I laugh my ass off at big bad Russia, nukes for days, well armed, complaining they feel threatened.

Should we nuke you for sanctions? 

Or for training ukranian saboteur on our territory?

Or for bringing guns to kill our countrymen?

Do you suggest to solve these conflicts with nukes? 

Why aren't you worried about your country organizing these conflicts though?

&gt;Youre totally hate infested, everything you do is out of hate

We have some serious hate to nazism, yes. For some other crimes aswell. We can't encourage someone to [kill and burn alive](https://youtu.be/QxcB0PI4ZLg?t=1347) for peaceful political beliefs, we hate that. US/NATO can, US/NATO loves it.

&gt;That their statehood is considered a falsehood

Experiment failed, USA/NATO decided to drag it to themselves and it went out of control.

&gt;DESPITE STANDING FOR 30 YEARS

30 years is nothing for history.

&gt;Your explanation of why you feel threatened by Ukraine, but not Finland, is paper thin

I don't remember Finland jumping around shouting ""hang russians"", but if they will and if you ask...

&gt;Finland has maintained neutrality for a long time, only to change that policy recently. They arent the only one. Why is that

Crysis of capitalism, USA is failing, Europe is brought under knife.

Sweden/Finland are pushed to NATO by their western patrons. [Despite all democratical traditions and logic](https://youtu.be/kHDbx-PrQ10?t=3435).

&gt;its because they are scared of you

I suggest you to watch video above.

&gt;You know no unity, and you never have.

That's true, like 200+ nations living together, having 37 official languages in a state is a country which, by your words ""knows no unity"".

And before that country united around itself half a globe, including most neighbours and was even called Soviet (Council) UNION.

I'm not sure you can even make more laughable statement :)

The people who still do business with you, its not because they like you, its because its in their interests

Rainbow pony world, where states ""love"" each other. Japan must really love USA for massive bombings and 2 nukes - right? :)

&gt;You would do well to keep it that way.

Russia will probably just sell resources to Asia. If Europe can't get rid of USA pressure, we shouldn't help Europe with cheap resources. We better help China for example. China doesn't bomb Iraq just to build embassy - it's not a bandit country, like some neocolonizers.

&gt;I cant wait to see your ships show up in the middle east with the grain you stole from Ukraine

I'm pretty sure the only one stealing grain atm is USA and Europe. 20 millions tonnes by USA and 20 millions tonnes by Germany, iirc. \~5 million tonnes left. I mean ukranians don't need food, that's obvious for NATO, but still. Can you leave them at least 10% of what the had?

Unlike USA doctrine, for example, same USA which is the only country that has used nuclear weapons. Has built military bases all around Russia and dropped short-mid range missiles treaty.

Do we have a right to defend ourselves? Do we have a right to voice a warning?

Or you strip russians off human rights?

&gt;weakest in the room

""Sarmat"" thinks otherwise. Plus crazy US proxy Ukraine will fall in some months. And same USA ran from Afghanistan, dropping their allies and drugs from planes.  Maybe you should brag less? :)

&gt;You will hear no such threats from the west, but best believe they are implied either way.

There were hundreds of threats and hundreds of such actions. Cmon, whole NATO exists to oppose Russia since the begining. Do you live on this planet at all, what are you saying? How many NATO trainings had Russia as enemy? :)

&gt;that are actually giving their own opinion on the matter is increasing

I'm more impressed how normal people rise while some scumbags run in foreign countries.

&gt;Youre a phony and a fraud, any finger pointed at you is met with a finger pointing back.

Why does it bother you?

If there is some standard of actions - why can't Russia follow it?

Like using collective safety article of UN to protect LDNR - we had full right to do so. Noone did illegal sanctions on USA/NATO for Yugoslavia. Noone did sanctions for Iraq either. Lybia/Afghanistan/Syria/Vietnam/Latin america/Africa...

Your states act like hypocritical lieful butchers, forcing mine to respond. SS parade in Kiev and all your medias telling how there are no nazis in Ukraine. 13,000 dead in a thousands of shellings of LDNR - but LDNR war is a myth. 6th wave of NATO expansion against agreement with Russia - and it's not a compromise to russian security.

There is no point to talk to you any longer, your states are crazy.

&gt;You couldnt have an original thought or notion if you tried.

I'm talking about reality, there is no need to invent something.

&gt;Unjustifed war of aggression.

[Unjustified war of agression.](https://youtu.be/vRac8cYTlEY?t=156)

Sorry.

&gt;You need

Maybe YOU need me to say this?

I for surely don't need to lie like that - to erase LDNR war, ukranian nazism or NATO involvement.

&gt;Youre not nazis, your Ruzzians, and that is worse

Can't call you objective :)

&gt;You talk about a swastika, what about Z

Z is Zapad. You guys promoted this symbol, with your ruZZians bullshit, But it became so good that we took it over.

Especially - slishu ZOV ebat AZOV.

&gt;just like the swastika

Oh no, every symbol is a swastika for sjw. Except obviously swastika itself (because you know mhm... Ukraine!) and USA flag :)

&gt;So you are saying the 50,000 civilians you have killed are Nazis?

How did you count?

For example, civilians in area which Ukranian army chose for a fight, but didn't evacuate them, and used them as a living shield for defense - who holds responsibility for their deaths?

For great example - missile hit in TV-tower in first days of conflict. Russian Ministry of defense informed on briefing that it will be targetted. Ukranian side keeping info bubble decided not to warn their people. As a collateral damage someone died. Who is responsible for such civilian deaths?

I'm not even talking about deliberate murders of so called ""collaborants"", which are any people who didn't support Ukranian army actions. ""Those who aren't ready to kill and to die - are bad human material"" (c) UA National guards commander about CIVILIANS.

&gt;That you were protecting them from...nazis?

We are protecting ourselves from NATO backed nazis. And normal ukranians. Unfortunately they are trapped by people with guns. That's pretty much like in nazi germany - you couldn't leave the system easily, even if you didn't belong to it.

&gt;Its the old mafia trick of create a problem, and then fix it, for a price or favor.

Like USA is bargaining terms of peace in europe now? :)

Oh.. you meant food supply. But it's not Russia who started sanctions (illegal restrictions, to be more exact, since they aren't UN approved).",4b600bd5f4f6cb792997ae06a3b7a887a1bad6ac,True,False,,,,,0,1653430259,,0,{},i9v0zq5,False,t3_uu58gc,False,True,t1_i9up3ks,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uu58gc/looks_like_video_confirmation_of_surrender_is_now/i9v0zq5/,1653430273,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653401459.0

Man, no one can confused Dutuerte as being pro western or NATO, why does he call Putin a killer of elderly and children? Could it be he is just offering his own assessment of his FRIEND, Putin?

Russia threatens the world with nuclear weapons, nursing some grudge about lack of respect? Yep, you are on the right team buddy. Loudest in the room, weakest in the room. You will hear no such threats from the west, but best believe they are implied either way.

It seems the number of people within your country that are actually giving their own opinion on the matter is increasing. Its especially respectable with the restrictions on free speech in your country. Brass balls on those ones, Navalny too. 

Oh and btw, MAXAR has kept Russia front and center this whole war and there is no discounting image after image of broken and destroyed Russian equipment. 

Youre a phony and a fraud, any finger pointed at you is met with a finger pointing back. It makes you a corporate shill like I said. You couldnt have an original thought or notion if you tried. All you know is NATO THIS AND NATO THAT NATO NATO NATO. Take some responsibility for your country's actions, and just call it what it is. Unjustifed war of aggression. You need to lean into it, lean into who and what you are, and stop trying to be something youre not.

Youre not nazis, your Ruzzians, and that is worse. You talk about a swastika, what about Z. Z is now a symbol of hate and genocide, just like the swastika, that I seem to struggle finding relevance beyond Russian propaganda. I see some radicals, some racists, same shit I see in every country, yours and mine included. So you are saying the 50,000 civilians you have killed are Nazis? That you were protecting them from...nazis? 

Youre totally hate infested, everything you do is out of hate. The US doesnt hate Russia, but Russia hates the US. Russia hates Ukraine, enough that they want to wipe them off the face of the map. That their statehood is considered a falsehood DESPITE STANDING FOR 30 YEARS. Your explanation of why you feel threatened by Ukraine, but not Finland, is paper thin. Finland has maintained neutrality for a long time, only to change that policy recently. They arent the only one. Why is that? It isnt because they have great love and admiration for the US, its because they are scared of you, and know that there is strength in unity. You know no unity, and you never have.

The people who still do business with you, its not because they like you, its because its in their interests. You would do well to keep it that way.

And they weren't responsible for 'civil' war. Ukraine doesn't want to be Russian don't you get that? They wouldn't have any war if not for you. The USSR broke up, get the fuck over it already. 

America is a war mongering nation, we stick our nose in way too many places. America has committed war crimes. Crossed the line many times.

But NEVER have we had a Putin, Stalin, Hitler figure. You have them all the time it would seem. None worse than the one you have now. Demented cold war relic mad because the USSR fell apart. The Baltics moved into NATO. Why is that? It certainly isn't because they were scared of NATO, they are scared of you. Your history and reputation precede you. 

Again, you never speak of anything I ask you? All you do is parrot reasons why you think this shit is okay. You ARE a corporate shill. You have twisted everything beyond recognition to anyone who will listen. You excuse the actions of your country by throwing out pathetic justifications of the atrocity that is common place whenever Russia gets involved. Childish don't you think? 

It doesn't matter. We are going down this path, and it's going to blow up in all of your faces, and the west. You ALL are to blame. Regular citizens just want to live and raise families but you feel the need to subjugate your neighbors. Acting like anyone is going to attack Russia. Gtfo with that. Why would they? For what? I laugh my ass off at big bad Russia, nukes for days, well armed, complaining they feel threatened. It's like the snowflakes here in my country. Looking for any reason or justification to lose their mind.

All those FORMER republics, don't want to be in your camp. That isn't the west fault. They clearly made the right call because they aren't the ones being invaded. They have vibrant economies and good living standards and PEACE. Meanwhile your heathens move in and steal every toilet and washing machine not bolted down because they live so much better. 

The crappy part for you is that it would seem your leader calculated every move, except for the possibility of getting smashed in Ukraine. If only that would have worked, this would be over by now. Russia would have Ukraine and we can all sit an argue about it, but that's not what happened.

Truthfully, in the beginning I was one of those that wanted the west to stay out of it. Ukraine isn't NATO, but a few weeks into it, there is no way to keep that position. Picture is worth 1000 words, and NOTHING you say can blunt that or try to spin it as the other guys fault. Ukraine is burning, not Russia. Well Russia a little too, but neither here nor there. The Ukrainians don't want to fight, they just want THEIR country that has been their country for 30 years. They didn't ask for this or 2014. You call it a civil war, hogwash. It was an invasion under false pretense with little green men, just like Georgia.

Like our country, yours has a certain playbook. The reason we gave Ukraine 40bn, is because the world at large cannot allow your war of aggression to continue into Europe. There will be no appeasement. This is building to WWIII and you're fucking crazy if you think anyone can control it. 

Again, you pretend that Russia is some innocent down trodden nation who is fighting for the little guy against the world hegemony! But no doubt you will leave things much worse than when you found them. You pretend that Russia hasn't crossed just as many lines as the US in the last 100 years. You have no moral highground. The cold war, took two parties. Not just one. At least I can admit that. 

The US didn't invade Ukraine, the US did not cause Ukraine to not want to ride with Russia. They made their own mind up. It's evident since they clearly don't see you as liberators. At all. The US didn't make you blow up maternity wards and apartments. Train stations filled with evacuees. Mass Graves. Executions. Torture. Rape of children. 

Tell me, how do you kill a child's family destroy their home and then act like you did them a favor. They don't want you there. They weren't a threat to you. You did this. Blame the west for anything in history you want, I don't care, but YOU DID THIS. Excuse it however you want, but it doesn't change it.

US withdrew from ICC for a reason, but your kidding yourself if you think you are the good guy or that this war was justified. Go home. Quit blaming everyone else for your actions. Two wrongs don't make a right and innocent people are dying by the thousands, and you justify it. 

You call genocide and destruction of Ukraine people, place, and culture 'strategy'. It's called terrorism. You want to break their will by extreme trauma, overwhelming destruction and tragedy. Influence the leadership to capitulate to make it stop. This is a well known terrorist tactic, using terror and fear.

Seriously, all Russian state TV talks about is nuking other places and making threats. What a fine upstanding place you represent. Haven't seen any nuclear threats lobbed at Russia lately, but Russia is throwing them around to the point of irrelevance. Raving lunatics, committed to the death of millions, hoping for it. Wishing for it even.

I still retain my sense of right and wrong. You don't. To me, there is never justification for genocide or mass murder, by any country. Your issues with Ukraine did not warrant this. Similar to Iraq. The war wasn't justified. We destabilized the region for years to come. Travesty. It was wrong and so are you. 

Clearly our views are both clouded by our respective countries propaganda. You especially lack the ability to be unbiased. Youre a party line kind of person. Stick to the talking points. Object, deflect, and upset. Blah blah. You believe everything your side says and does. You justify and rationalize every atrocity or downright deny. You couldn't admit wrong if you wanted to. I can.

I guess we should just all see Russia as the lovable underdog, fighting hard for the rights of Russian speaking people everywhere and fuck everyone else right?

&gt;Your facts aren't facts.

Which of my facts isn't a fact? :)

&gt;The difference between us is I know my government is hypocritical.

Damn this is so smart, learning that politicans can be hypocritical...

&gt;No respect for human life, even your own, and I stand by that.

May I ask what do you read/watch to get an opinion from other side of conflict?

I think your claim is absurd.

&gt;You don't think it's because of the war

Actually Ukraine started this war in 2014 by physically attacking regions that refused new governors sent to them from post-coup Kiev.

Illegal president Turchinov signed the law. And the units that fought there did all kinds of crimes - and they keep doing it now, in much greater amounts.

&gt;nazi style concentration I mean filtration camps.

How is filtration camp connected to nazis?

You don't need to separate soldiers from civilians? You don't need to check people for crimes? How does it work in your mind? Seems like you live on couch, and have no idea about reality.

&gt;BTW, the Cuban missle crisis, was a two way street.

Was it a two way street when USA decided to escalate by bringing missiles to Turkey? Or after that?

&gt;You're not justified in any of it.

Of course we are - such a simple demands - Ukraine has to stop war in LDNR, Ukraine has to denazify, Ukraine has to demilitarize in terms of offensive weapons, Ukraine has to refuse NATO path.

I doubt simple ukranians cheer for war in LDNR - 73% of them voted for president who promised ""to stop war in LDNR by any cost, even if it will cost him career or make him stand on knees"". He did the opposite. I doubt majority of simple ukranians are pro-nazi regardless of brainwashing done to them. I doubt simple ukranians want to go at war, judging by how they bribe customs and wear dresses to escape mobilization. And non-NATO status was declared in their sovereignity declaration.

&amp;#x200B;

So, who holds them as hostage? Who uses them as proxy? Who is responsible for this conflict and all these deaths? USA/NATO and their puppet Kiev regime.

&gt;Secret police, extra judicial killings, camps, genocide.

Literally ukraine - SBU terrorizing people, murders like Buzina and other pro-russian/pro-eastern activists, camps including illegal like Azov/Aidar and SBU ones, genocide of Donchans, whom the call ""colorado bugs"".

You've literally described Ukraine when talking about how nazi state looks like.

&gt;How do you rate russias military performance so far mate?

Quite good.

&gt;Going as planned?

I'm not in headquarters to know operational plans :)

&gt;You signed a deal to end this war 8 years ago.

Yeah and we tried.

For example first point of these agreements is to change Ukranian constitution to allow special status for DNR and LNR - was it done by Kiev? Nope.

They refused Minsk-2, that's a fact. Germany and France instead of forcing them to follow agreement did the opposite - probably mostly because of US influence.

&gt;Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons, they trusted you

Yeah, when declaring sovereignity Ukraine was obliged to 2 principles - neutrality and non-nuclear status. Neutrality was dropped when they've rewrote constitution. Various nuclear threats were made aswell (even parlament deputy once called to explode Southern NPP), but 19th of february 2022 Zelenskiy said that they'll reconsinder non-nuclear status. That's a much serious threat than imaginary WMD in Iraq.

Why do you defend such country, which violates all treaties it signs?

&gt;you didn't give them statehood

We literally did, but their oligarchs didn't find compromise with each other and sold country to NATO.

&gt;your piece of shit empire collapsed because it was hollow and drunk on its own vodka and values.

If you wanna be rusophobic - don't forget to wear your swastika.

&gt;Nothing you can say to me will change my mind or anyone else's.

That's the definition of fanatic.

Literally - just check dictionary (if you have one).

&gt;We have the ability unlike everyone in Russia to seek our news and info from whatever source and outlet we like

Can you read RT? Can you watch Perviy on youtube?

Oh, you can't... 9000 channels were deleted from youtube, and pro-russian point is only talked where? In Tucker Carlson show, but only because it opposes Biden? :) I've asked what sources of russian view do you watch above, let's see.

&gt;We don't get arrested for calling things a war

Can you quote me criminal law about this?

Let's check, maybe you were fooled?

I know that you gonna just run from answer, because there is no such criminal law.

&gt;I wish you well and hope you rediscover YOUR sense of right and wrong. Not your mother country.

Oh, I know quite well what's right and wrong. And I relate both to Ukraine and Russia to say that.

You know one side of that conflcit isn't responsible for ""Alley of Angels"", isn't shouting ""hang moscals"" and doesn't hope that their POW countrymen will be treated differently to POW that they have. That's the right side, I guess.

&gt;I hope that there is a swift end to this conflict.

And you've made a right estimation? :)

And that's why you repeat western NATO propaganda word by word, including details? I see. We call it ""useful idiot"" then.

&gt;You think because I live here that I think the US is a beacon of morality and righteousness? I don't.

Why do you think someone cares what americans think?

You guys can't fix even basic problems in your country. Now you have demented president and a bunch of hawks behind him starting another war.

You tell me fairytales how smart and critical thinking you are - but at the same time you support war organized by your state, in your main proxy. How do you justify supporting people, who were previously considered as a neonazi group by your own officials, fighting under similar ideas and same swastika, which was used by Buffallo shooter?

As you say ""Amazing really, but this is possible in 2022.""

&gt;I only wish it was possible for you to see both sides in the same way.

Well, I'm on reddit discussing western point - it's not like you've came on russian forum discussing russian point of view.

&gt;You don't give reasons, you give excuses.

Who are you for me to make excuses, lol? :)

&gt;You don't give reasons, you give excuses.  
&gt;  
&gt;You make the facts whatever you want.

What does that suppose to mean?

&gt;Navalny has balls twice the size of yours or your fearless leader for coming back to Russia.

Maybe he is just useless and can't do anything for his owners outside of Russia? In Russia he can at least sew clothes in prison though :)

It's so funny to observe westerners talk about Navalny, not having any idea what's going on. That this is just another wannabe politician-populist, western puppet. Like Guaido or Tikhanovskaya or Pashinyan and many others.

&gt;He was jailed because he is a threat

Provocateur, not threat. Like Gapon.

&gt;People that aren't threats to power generally, generally don't have to worry about assassination.

That's why russian doctors treated him well and russian government allowed convicted person to be sent to foreign country, to fix his health - because he isn't threat.

&gt;You tried to kill him, the fool went back

Typical western press reader...

He wasn't poisoned and he isn't a fool.

&gt;Navalny was arrested for disparaging a WWII vet.

Nope, he was arrested for fraud (159.4).

What Assange did wrong to get 175 years of prison - talked about war crimes and international violation of human rights by USA?

Democracy in action - Bush and Powell are on freedom, Assange jailed, and you worry about western puppet Navalny - american citizen in a nutshell.

By the way - how did you like recent Bush talk about ""one man decision to invade""? How did you like prank call with him?

&gt;What do you say about your recent high profile government figures denouncing Russias war?

Who?

&gt;There will certainly be more.

There are plenty of western shills here still. There were even more before you started openly discriminating and dehumanizing russians by ethnicity 3 months ago :)

&gt;Yet, you're the only place who sees events this way.

No man, we are majority - just look around. Central and southern america knows your CIA methods of opression, exploiting and neocolonization - they know what's going on in Ukraine. Same with Africa, same with Asia. What's left? NATO and satellites, 1/7th of world population? And even in these countries majority isn't stupid to believe media storyline.

So... only loud brainwashed minority chooses not to notice huge ukranian guilt in this conflict.

Hell, they already broke all rules of war - but someone cheers for them, that's amazing :)

&gt;all of the sudden the US is viewed like a white knight.

Ahahaha, where, in NATO's media? :)

&gt;It's not because they are it's because the threat of evil Russia looms so large

Oh yeah, that's evil Russia... dared to speak against NATO expansion and LDNR war done by neonazis.

If you believe what you say - you are perfect product of US brainwashing.

&gt;It's frankly comical that you portray Europe as a Nazi sympathizer or supporters. I give you a failing grade for creativity. Could have done better than freaking nazis, with a Jewish president.

Not as comical as [Victory day congratulation from ukranian president](https://twitter.com/wyattreed13/status/1523772143061807109) (ethnical jew).

Once servers in NY realize lot of requests for some particular page comes locally, instead of routing each request to London, they sort of hold reply to request in their memory and offer it themselves. This lowers the load of traffic as requests are not sent to London anymore. As Google robots scan web, they create own cache, which is shown in search snippets after searching Google. Now let’s imagine somebody changes context of the page. As notification is sent to servers in NY to update the context (either upon change of context or predefined expiration time of cache), same notification is not sent to Google to do the same. So Google uses old cache of page which already was changed. In short. Someone changed context of Wikipedia page (anybody can do it), Google did not caught up yet with this fact and shows old version (of the page).

You think because I live here that I think the US is a beacon of morality and righteousness? I don't. Do you think I believe half the shit the US says? I actually still retain the ability to sift through the garbage and generally get to the bottom of things. Amazing really, but this is possible in 2022. 

I only wish it was possible for you to see both sides in the same way. You don't give reasons, you give excuses. You say yeah we didn't do that, but if we did, it's because you made us. You make the facts whatever you want. Navalny has balls twice the size of yours or your fearless leader for coming back to Russia. He was jailed because he is a threat, and you know it. People that aren't threats to power generally, generally don't have to worry about assassination. You tried to kill him, the fool went back, and now he's in prison. Not smart, but brave. Navalny was arrested for disparaging a WWII vet. Give me a break. 

Also, why jail all of the jehovahs witnesses in Russia? What did they do to Putin? Knock too loud on a Saturday morning?

What do you say about your recent high profile government figures denouncing Russias war? There will certainly be more. Which means more murder suicides and clumsy falls out windows.

 You justify everything you say with what you call facts. Yet, you're the only place who sees events this way. It's frankly comical that you portray Europe as a Nazi sympathizer or supporters. I give you a failing grade for creativity. Could have done better than freaking nazis, with a Jewish president.

Your facts aren't facts. The difference between us is I know my government is hypocritical. I know they don't have the right of it, alot. In fact it's funny, because since this war started, all of the sudden the US is viewed like a white knight. Why is that?

You don't think it's because of the war, you started, and the atrocities and outright theft of Ukraines land, their food, and their people do you? Maybe its because the rape of women and children, flattening of cities, nazi style concentration I mean filtration camps. 

BTW, the Cuban missle crisis, was a two way street. Literally every event, you spin it so that Russia can do no wrong. Like they are champions of humanity and simply are doing their duty for all humanity. 

You're not justified in any of it. Tell me what on earth justifies doing this? Millions will starve, thousands dead, children's voices no longer heard. Homes and lives destroyed. For what? For nazis? For the US? Please explain to me how the people of Ukraine deserved this. When did they attack you? 

If you wake up one day, and run into a nazi, you ran into a a Nazi, it happens. If you call people nazis all day, then you might be the Nazi or at the very least resort to their tactics. Secret police, extra judicial killings, camps, genocide. 

Fuck man, at this rate, the NAZIS are going to start looking up to you. Except they actually took the countries they invaded at first. 

How do you rate russias military performance so far mate? Going as planned? You signed a deal to end this war 8 years ago. It meant nothing. Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons, they trusted you. You didn't give them statehood, your piece of shit empire collapsed because it was hollow and drunk on its own vodka and values. A bunch of yes men, too scared to pass gas at Putins 20 foot table.

Here's the part where we go our separate ways. Nothing you can say to me will change my mind or anyone else's. We have the ability unlike everyone in Russia to seek our news and info from whatever source and outlet we like. We don't get arrested for calling things a war, when they are clearly  a war. 

I love you, as a fellow human. I cannot control my government or yours. They both have done despicable things and have waged unjustified wars. I can admit that, you can't. I wish you well and hope you rediscover YOUR sense of right and wrong. Not your mother country.

Who decides what is okay and what is not? USA?

Russia has all reasons to perform this unpleasant but rightful operation, provoked by USA/NATO. 

&gt;Nothing the US justifies what you did to UKRAINE. 

Have you heard of Cuban crysis?

&gt; One minute it's the existential threat to Russia by a country who's never invaded you or attacked you

As potential NATO springboard - it is.

&gt;Then it's denazification. 

Denazification part was obvious since 2014 when neonazis got embraced instead of getting punishments.

&gt;Then it's war with the west.

Of course, since Ukraine is just western proxy. West doesn't hide that - listen Liz Truss speech or recent Bush talk on this. How many - 58bln of military help since start, plus many more since 2014? All kinds of possible help, except for direct official army and heavy weapons which can escalate conflict to nuclear?

&gt;Then it's for Christianity.

Here you lie.

&gt;Theh it's for rebuilding USSR in that bizarre manifesto where Ukraine doesn't have a right to exist? 

What does that suppose to mean? Rebuilding USSR? Russian Federation? USSR first gave level of stateness to Ukraine, just fyi. But, yes, in current form Ukraine can't have such stateness. If they don't change political course - this country will disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, you've made a nonsense claim about putin because of your binary childish approach to this complex subject.

&gt;The reason you have to copy and paste a word document full of bullet points is because you are the ones with a story to sell.

I don't copy paste anything from word document, I even reopen all links while posting them. Yeah, you guys are stupid on reddit that I have to repeat myself even on most obvious things. How many of redditors cheering for ukraine don't realise their nat.guards walk under swastika? 95 percent? That's ridiculous how stupid people are.

But your insult is funny, it shows that you aren't ready to deal with someone who believes in what he says, because he knows that's true.

&gt;All I've heard is finger pointing at every country except the one you invaded. 

Ukraine? It's awful - I can write a book why it's failed state.

&gt;Its the same reason they didn't greet you as liberators.

Or maybe they don't greet us as liberators because they might get killed for that, the same way as pro-russians were killed for last 8 years? 

But you of course don't know that. How anyone who doesn't help AFU/SBU/Natguards/police are ""collaborants"" and should be treated by ""martial law"" (death)?

&amp;#x200B;

Just as you haven't seen a single person happy about getting rid of ukrops. Nor in LDNR, nor in Kharkov, nor around Kiev, nor in Kherson-Zaporogje... 

Type ""9 мая Херсон/Бердянск/Мелитополь/Энергодар"" - seems like they are really upset, right? :)

&gt;You know, say what you will about America, but Putin is so scared of any challenger.

Which means - ""you are right about USA creating a terrible and dangerous system of international relationships, based on their hegemony, exploitation, terror and wars, but we shouldn't speak about that, because my media makes me dislike Putin"".

Putin is my president, not yours, don't worry about him.

&gt;It's why navalny is in prison

Navalny is western shill who has violated multiple laws and came in country knowing he will go directly in prison. That's a standard move, to wait pro-US coup, Saakashvili returned to Georgia the same way for example.

And he isn't really a challenger, just a puppet with some support, but loyal to his NATO owners. What was his support around country - 2-3%? Cmon, it's like 1/5th of commies support.

&gt;Anyone who dares disagree is dealt with. 

Such a nonsense, there are parties constantly criticizing state policies, there are big politcians doing that, hell there even was a state funded media who was dedicated to criticizing government (and head of government is essentially Putin, prime-minister is a functioneer) - Echo of Moscow. Yes, they got closed after operation started, because it was too much, to shit on people for their own money (I mean russian supporters of state course). But it existed more than 2 decades and noone touched it! And that's just one example.

&amp;#x200B;

From other side keeping such ""opponents"" (Navalny) and ""critics"" (western-liberals from Echo) - is beneficial, because they discredit yourself and promote you. Maybe it's pragmatic approach.

During Maidan violent (murderers) protestors supported by different powers (like those presented by Victoria Nulland) took over power in capital and started threatening legal president and legal local powers. He decided not to respond violently and ran away - big mistake.
