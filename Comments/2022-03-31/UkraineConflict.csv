A normal troll is an online user who deliberately posts inflammatory, offensive, or provocative messages in order to elicit a strong emotional response or to disrupt normal on-topic discussion. A state sponsored troll is a person or group of people who are paid by a government to spread propaganda or to discredit an opposing point of view. The tactics of a state sponsored troll may overlap with those of a normal troll, but the state sponsored troll is more likely to be more organized and have more resources at their disposal.  
  
This troll is posting inflammatory or offensive content  
  
The goal of this tactic is to create division and discord by provoking a reaction from people who hold opposing views. By doing so, it becomes harder for people to come to a consensus on important issues, and makes it more likely that they will give up and stop trying to engage in productive dialogue. By doing this, the trolls hope to sow chaos and confusion, and ultimately undermine faith in democracy and the political process.

This troll is also spreading disinformation: This is false or misleading information that is spread deliberately to deceive people.

Fight disinformation:

1. Create a list of trusted news sources and only share information from those sources.  
2. Be skeptical of everything you read online and do your own research\* to verify claims.  
3. Don't share information unless you are sure it is true.\*\*  
4. Check the date of an article before you share it to make sure it is not outdated.  
5. Be aware of the source of the information you are reading and consider their motives.  
6. Don't believe everything you see in photos or videos, as they can be doctored.  
7. Be cautious of clickbait headlines and only read articles from reputable sources.  
8. Be aware of your own biases and look at information objectively.  
9. Take time to verify claims made in social media posts before sharing them.  
10. Report any disinformation you see to the site or social media platform where it is found.

\* (Note: The phrase ""do your own research"" became a slogan for disinformation because it is a way for people to spread false information without being held accountable. When someone tells you to ""do your own research,"" they are essentially telling you to take their word for it and not to question their claims. This is a dangerous way of thinking, as it can lead to people believing false information. Additionally, this slogan encourages people to trust their own research over that of experts, which can lead to people believing false information.)

The order came five weeks into Russia's invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that none of those called up would be sent to any ""hot spots"".

The issue of conscripts' involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March 9, the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on various occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in. read more

Putin's spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts.

The annual spring military draft, which runs from April 1 to July 15, will affect Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27, Putin's decree said.

Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May.

""Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots,"" he said in remarks published on his ministry's website.

However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russia's National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. The war has killed thousands of people and uprooted millions.

In recent days Russia has reframed its objectives, saying it never intended to take the capital Kyiv and other major cities but is focused on ""liberating"" eastern areas where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army since 2014.

Its statements have been greeted sceptically by Ukraine and Western governments. Military analysts have suggested the declared focus on the eastern Donbas region may be an attempt to make it easier for Putin to seek a face-saving exit.",5aacdf793a67f4d4938ef70bff0155f02eb3c60f,True,False,,,,,0,1648729316,,0,{},i2u7fkp,True,t3_tsyiv3,False,False,t3_tsyiv3,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsyiv3/russia_drafts_134500_conscripts_but_says_they/i2u7fkp/,1648729330,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648700516.0

Fighting against a democratic nation with an administration open to criticism and ridicule of a free press and more vulnerable to enemy propaganda is easier for the likes of Putin. For example the US in the Vietnam war - they were not beaten in Vietnam they were beaten in the press of the free world and by their own voters. The warlords know they only need to be resilient and persistent to eventually have a democracy give up and go home.
It's for this reason alone I hope the Ukranians stay strong and resist. The chain of events have shown this Russian MO complies with this general rule - they just keep coming back for more. Give in to their demands today and they, no matter what assurances western politicians give them, five/ten/fifteen years from now Putin or his ilk will repeat the exercise on some bullshit excuse to demand more. I probably won't be alive to witness it but you will. For as long as Ukranians wish to struggle I hope the west continues to fund and supply them. They cannot win in conventional warfare against Russia but they can make life unbearable for them in the hope the attitudes toward warfare changes in Russia. Their younger generation are not so easily fooled by the likes of Putin as the brainwashed older generations have been.
Unless something drastic happens in the west, I cannot see a scenario where western forces will be unleashed to help Ukraine. I could be wrong but the west is more concerned about fiscal matters and voter popularity than any despotic megalomaniac like Putin will ever be. One way of action will protect their immediate effort, the other could cause their voters hardship - I think we all know which they will follow. Poor, brave Ukraine may even become extinct if they give as much as one metre more to Putin. As I said - I may be wrong but the omens are not particularly auspicious for the Ukranians. We will have to just agree to disagree on what we feel should/might happen next. Opinions are like arseholes - everyone has one, some just smell worse than others.

At that time the parliament voted democratically to remove him through the legal imprachment process and hold more DEMOCRATIC elections. Poroshekno then won during the first round of elections which wasnt normal with runoffs happening like what happened even with Zelensky.

2nd, Donbass and Crimea didnt vote in any legal sense and with Russian gunmen being bused in and holding weapons during the widely known fraudulent ""votes"" they got an unprecedented and false vote count of 97%. So fuck off with your bullshit lies, half truths and trying to rewrite history. 

Russia started this when they bused in all those mercenaries and others who wanted to go to the area that werent Ukranian and a lot of the ethnic Ukrainians left because of everything.

He added there is still merit in an expanded G7 and while Johnson’s “insistence on including India” could create gridlock, Australia and South Korea would be “logical joiners.”

The G7, or an expanded version of it, could also invite countries such as South Korea and Switzerland to attend discussions on sanctions on an ad hoc basis, even if they refuse to join the organization formally, he said.

“Using NATO runs the risk of making this an extension of military action and looks too much like ‘the West,’” he said. “G7 would be better — it has the U.S. and the EU in it, as well as the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Japan. And it can be enlarged as the Carbis Bay summit was. Even without a formal secretariat, the existing G7 is the logical forum.

“I don’t see a problem, as long as you don’t call it a number … Whenever the prime minister has tried to go for a catchy title like D10, he’s got himself into terrible trouble because then you do exclude a whole bunch of countries.”

Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative MP who chairs the House of Commons defense select committee, supported the idea of opening up the G7 to new members as a way to fight for “stronger standards and values” and begin to “rebuild the foundations” of international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, which he said is not functioning as it was intended.",0ede374a2c4779515352779342a13adbb21f007c,True,False,,,,,0,1648677168,,0,{},i2rqxgz,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqwvr,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqxgz/,1648677184,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648368.0

However, this option presents the same problem as the expanded G7 proposal: There are six EU countries that have sanctioned Russia that are not members of NATO, nor are Japan and Switzerland, among others. Opponents counter that it would be odd to link economic sanctions with a security alliance.

EU ambassadors have not yet discussed options for more structured cooperation on sanctions, and many feel current coordination efforts with the U.S. are working well. Brussels and Washington are also already trying to meet regularly under the auspices of the Trade and Technology Council, launched in June, with another meeting expected to take place in Paris in May.

Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial services, said Tuesday the EU and the U.S. are in “lock-step” on sanctions, and that the key was “to ensure effective and full implementation of sanctions across jurisdictions.”

“We will continue to coordinate our response with the strongest determination and unity. And we are fully committed to strengthening our close cooperation on sanctions and sharing information with our U.S. and other partners,” McGuinness said.

Robin Niblett, director of the London-based Chatham House foreign affairs think tank, said many international sanctions agreed before Brexit relied on exclusive information shared by Britain, so it would be counterproductive for the EU to try to sideline the U.K. from key discussions on this topic.

“It doesn’t surprise me that some EU governments and the European Commission definitely would rather not have the G7 in the middle of this because of course that reduces their power and their clout vis-à-vis with the U.S., and they get mixed up with Canada, the U.K. and Japan, and then they are not in the driving seat,” Niblett said.",1c4206f74635941d8203de4ec2186b85de513fc9,True,False,,,,,0,1648677162,,0,{},i2rqwvr,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqw5k,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqwvr/,1648677175,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648362.0

She has previously advocated forming a “network of liberty” with partners that share strong trade and security ties, even if they are not liberal democracies.

“It is very important for us to build that very strong network with the G7,” Truss told MPs. “I think we can do more to strengthen the G7 and give it a more permanent footing.”

Observers see in her idea an evolution of the so-called D10 concept — an expanded version of the G7 including Australia, India and South Korea, first pitched by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2020.

But the British proposal does not have much support in continental Europe, according to an EU diplomat. EU leaders believe the G7 has allowed them to have frank discussions on sensitive security matters, but are reluctant to introduce any changes that may make it more vulnerable to pressure from civil servants or others, the diplomat said.

Johnson’s pitch for a D10 rather than a G7 “died” at the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, last summer, amid concerns it would be perceived as an anti-China club, the envoy said, adding that attempts to float this idea again will not succeed despite the radical change in circumstances posed by the war in Ukraine.

“It would create more problems than solutions,” the diplomat said, pointing to China’s likely opposition to India joining the group. “We need to play with what we’ve got.”

One EU official suggested the U.K.’s desire to strengthen the G7 stems from its feelings of isolation post Brexit.

“The U.K. is hugely frustrated as they have very little impact on the sanctions packages, so I understand they want to work more via the G7,” the official said. “They are the fifth wheel on the wagon. It’s mostly between the EU and the U.S. The sanctions are such a balancing act within the EU that it’s mostly up to others to align with us once we [are] agreed on internally.”

Others on the Continent suggest allies could create a “committee for sanctions” connected to NATO, arguing the transatlantic military alliance represents the majority of governments involved in those discussions.",1c7a33cac1fa7d7c9423133b687703bb872f9e97,True,False,,,,,0,1648677154,,0,{},i2rqw5k,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t1_i2rqvad,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqw5k/,1648677171,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648354.0

**The UK has proposed strengthening the G7 — but the EU appears more comfortable with the status quo.**

LONDON — Western allies have presented a united front against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but they’ve hit a familiar stumbling block in deciding the best forum to coordinate sanctions — disagreement between Brussels and London.

After doling out a series of measures meant to punish Moscow over the past month, the European Union, United States and the United Kingdom are now trying to work out the best way to formally synchronize these penalties going forward.

While the EU seems comfortable with the ad hoc status quo, the U.K. has floated the notion of bulking up the G7 group of wealthy democracies to make that the main forum for such discussions, giving it a secretariat to make it more similar to other international organizations such as NATO.

U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo announced a new “sanctions dialogue” to streamline coordination on Tuesday after visiting both London and Brussels, but did not offer details on Washington’s preferred method for holding such talks. U.S. President Joe Biden first mentioned such a plan after a NATO summit in Brussels last week, saying allies had discussed creating an organization to ensure compliance with the sanctions, tackle any loopholes and look “at who has violated any of the sanctions, and where and when and how they violated them.”

On Tuesday, Adeyemo made it clear that cooperation on sanctions involves more players than just the 27 governments in the EU when he told an event in London that “more than 30 partners and allies” have formed a “coalition in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”

For London, the natural home for discussions on further sanctions is the G7, which includes the U.K., U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told a U.K. parliamentary committee in early March that the G7 has been “instrumental” in coordinating sanctions against Russia, saying the war “demonstrates the importance of working with our allies, including non-democracies.”",20774cb7313d9851d9ee643d2b007da553b883fc,True,False,,,,,0,1648677144,,0,{},i2rqvad,True,t3_tsk6z3,False,True,t3_tsk6z3,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tsk6z3/eu_and_uk_at_odds_over_how_to_coordinate/i2rqvad/,1648677163,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648648344.0

So, Trump basically followed a line already agreed. He might be much more vocal about it, and called out the other NATO allies on the subject in a very showy way, but that’s about it.

As for Trump just pull US out of NATO, it’s not that simple, since it’s not like pulling out of e.g. the Paris climate agreement. But, his ongoing digs at NATO, questioning its relevance for US certainly could undermine NATO’s reputation among republican woters and hence ultimatly make it more attractive for Republican lawmakers to make the actual withdrawal happen.

Multiple sources, citing e.g. Esper, Bolton and Mattis point to Trump’s intention of abolishing NATO, and litterally today Trump called for Putin to help him find dirt on Hunter Biden. 

Almost at the same time Russian state TV have a segment where Russian pundits Call for an American regime shift to get Trump back. Isn’t that just an interesting coincident…
