One counter argument against the ""this war is the West's fault"" that I heard/agree with isL   
 Since 2014, there was a 0% chance that Ukraine was joining NATO.  Russia invaded and occupied Crimea/Dombass.  The very second Ukraine joins NATO, article 5 would automatically go into effect and NATO would be obligated to attack the Russian (invasion) forces in Ukraine.  Before the ink is dry, the West would be declaring war on Russia.  So it was never going to happen.  Now as far as pre-2014, that's a different story.  But it kind of puts a hole in those calling the *current* war the West's fault...

Obviously we can go back further than 2014 though and my main thought about that is, why do all of these countries that border Russia want to join NATO and anger their super-power neighbor (with which they share strong cultural/ethnic ties, no less)?  It would be really impressive if it was all due to the West's poor decisions or coercion...As in, could it be Russia's behavior...?

Because Russia suffered so many casualties, they can't stay there, and have to consolidate forces.

Staying around Kyiv is futile and pointless for Russia now. Staying there would mean sending more troops and more supplies there every day for months, and taking serious casualties, all for basically nothing.

While it would bleed Ukrainian armies and civilians as well, Russia doesn't have enough troops to do that and their plan D at the same time.

* Always overestimate your enemy. And most analysts we read assumed Russia was enemy, so they overestimated.
* Information on Ukraine was sparse at best. EX: I posted a little bit about the Stugna-P before the war, and that it would be a very effective weapon against tanks. There was very very little information on it before the war. Now we are seeing video evidence of them ambushing columns and inflicting real damage. Against MBTs!
* We've severely underestimated the Ukrainian modernization of the Ukrainian army. Again, information was sparse. But people who were dealing with the Ukrainian army before the war knew that they'd be a difficult adversary for Russia.
* Public information on Ukrainian force numbers is hard to come by. My estimate is close to 200k soldiers before mobilization. 
* Russia propaganda worked on western analysts. The ""modernization"" seems to be mostly just to build a reputation rather than to implement real capability. 
* Russia was probably largely unaware of their own problems. They have just been coming off of a few victories in Crimea and the War in Donbass (I'd argue not a victory, but was definitely spun in Russia as a victory). When there are so many lies, it's difficult for the military to understand the real story, and that has a huge detrimental effect on decision making skills of the entire chain of command. 
* Real information on Russia military capability post 2000 was sparse except for the Crimea and Donbass. Crimea was a special forces operation and Donbass wasn't the full might of the Russian military. So it's difficult to see those through the cloud of war.
* Most Ukrainian wins seem to have been due to grit fighting. AKA infantry outwitting their enemy. Not special weapons (Tanks, Migs, etc). Not air power (TB2). Good old fashion skirmishes and battles on the ground. Russia does not have a counter to that other than sending more bodies to the front. 

And here is the biggest kicker that I think nobody is really talking about.

[],False,,Tilting_Gambit,,,[],,,,text,t2_dulkt,False,False,"&gt; More of the Western experts who study Russia’s armed forces could and should have anticipated these problems. The Russian military has not been asked to undertake complex technological or logistical operations for at least three decades. Its more recent military actions, such as the bombing of Syria, were quite straightforward operations, in which aircraft could be used to terrorize an enemy that could not efficiently fire back.

Heaps of people were saying exactly this, though. It was certainly no secret that there were no relevant recent experiences to speak of, so there was no way to determine how Russian logistics would actually perform. What's the author's criticism here? It feels like he's just rushing to be the first to say ""Western intelligence was wrong and now I'm going to come up with reasons they got it wrong"" (to get published in the Atlantic). 

&gt;To truly understand a military’s effectiveness, analysts must investigate not only how it looks on a spreadsheet but also how it may function in the chaos and pressure of a battlefield. War is an extremely difficult and complex business. Western strategists cannot go back in time and alter their earlier assessments. 

What's the call to action here? I find it silly that O'Brien doesn't think this is what intelligence and military personnel do already. Of course military planners know that war is more than a spreadsheet of equipment. Western soldiers have spent the last 60 years getting smoked by farmers with AK-47s. 

No military uses equipment + doctrine as an equation for how a military will do. There's evaluation of commander's experience and competence, political factors, social factors, reviews of recent military engagements, how doctrine is used in exercises, environmental and terrain factors, how thorough the enemy's planning cycle is, etc etc etc. 

&gt;Any system with a widespread consensus that an excellent and modernized Russian military would conquer Ukraine in a matter of days is a system in crisis.

Intelligence is a world of incomplete information. It's a world of probabilities and assessments about unknown factors. The Russians seem to have planned a Day 1 assault on Hostomel with a Day 2 assault into Kyiv looking for a fast regime change. If that had worked, authors like O'Brien would likely be saying it was ""obvious"" the Russians would win the war quickly. 

One thing that worked extremely well was that within *four days* Western intelligence organisations had completely reversed their previous assessments and recognised that Russia was getting smashed and unlikely to meet all their objectives. Within a week they were skeptical, bordering on certain, that an operation on Kyiv was beyond Russia's capabilities. That shows a surprising amount of organisational dexterity for ostensibly big, old, bureaucratic institutions like UK's Defence Intelligence or the US' National Intelligence Community. 

They changed their assessments as they received more information, which is perfectly fine and what intelligence analysts should strive to do. [Tetlock goes into this in his research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7333631/): the ability to determine what information means as it comes in and detect the important stuff from the unimportant stuff is greatly important. 

&gt;We can, and must, try to do better next time. If world leaders have a better understanding of the potential difficulties of any war in East Asia, for example, perhaps they will realize how hard the outcome of such a confrontation is to predict. If the Chinese tried an amphibious landing on Taiwan, for instance, they would be undertaking maybe the most complex wartime operation, and one that their military has never attempted before. I can’t tell you what would happen, but I know it would not go according to plan. War never does.

Yeah mate, any actual advice? What would you have done better, or differently, than military/intelligence personnel? What would you do differently for China-Taiwan?

The official narrative is that they're withdrawal as a show pf good faith to help negotiations.

Which kind of war?

An offensive war to conquer another country? A war to defend its own country against an aggressor? 

The French comparison is interesting, because one the things not mentioned in the article is the abysmal non-functionality of the French government after years of internal hick-hack and bickering between the political parties, with corresponding effects on military leadership, motivation and aggressiveness. 

Lets stay hypothetical: *NATO would invade Russia.* vs Russias invasion of Ukraine.

- How long had the invasion force time to prepare the actual invasion of Ukraine? Some articles / statements indicate a time frame of a few weeks tops, with some estimation of a single week, with lower level units having a few days of planning. Would that be the same case the other way around?
- The logistics system failed as far as we can tell, but then again it is a logistic system to defend a country, which means that it stands to reason that it would perform far better if 
- The invasion force can only be as good as the intelligence it has. We have the first indications that the different sources of intelligence (FSB, political filtering etc) did not worked well together, with vastly contractionary goals inside the Russian bureaucracy and access to Putin. Will that be the same case when Germany announces *OP Barbarossa: now with eve more red beard?""*
- Is there a fair differentiation between the errors the invasion force *itself* did, the government by accepting intelligence reports stating ""all Ukrainians will love the invading Russian troops"" or the military high command by setting up the invasion force with BTGs and short term supply systems?

Especially considering the potential of further escalation (Donbass occupation, Baltic invasion etc) the exact kind of failure of both Western intelligence assumptions and why exactly the military failed in the first few weeks should be answered first, before we come to a conclusion that the Russian army is a paper tiger and poses no threat.  

The Soviet Union stumbled in the first few months of WW2, with the Wehrmacht running haywire through the first few hundred kilometres. Then they got their act together. An army who failed once is not necessarily an army who will fail every time.

Let me tell you a story about a military that was supposedly one of the best in the world. This military had some of the best equipment: the heaviest and most modern tanks, next-generation aircraft, and advanced naval vessels. It had invested in modernization, and made what were considered some of Europe’s most sophisticated plans for conflict. Moreover, it had planned and trained specifically for a war it was about to fight, a war it seemed extremely well prepared for and that many, perhaps most, people believed it would win.

All of these descriptions could apply to the Russian army that invaded Ukraine last month. But I’m talking about the French army of the 1930s. That French force was considered one of the finest on the planet. Winston Churchill believed that it represented the world’s best hope for keeping Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany at bay. As he said famously in 1933, and repeated a number of times afterward, “Thank God for the French army.”

Of course, when this French army was actually tested in battle, it was found wanting. Germany conquered France in less than two months in 1940. All of the French military’s supposed excellence in equipment and doctrine was useless. A range of problems, including poor logistics, terrible communications, and low morale, beset an army in which soldiers and junior officers complained of inflexible, top-down leadership. In 1940, the French had the “best” tank, the Char B-1. With its 75-mm gun, the Char B-1 was better armed than any German tank, and it outclassed the Germans in terms of armor protection as well. But when the Battle of France started, the Char B-1 exhibited a number of major handicaps, such as a gas-guzzling engine and mechanical unreliability.

Having good equipment and good doctrine reveals little about how an army will perform in a war. To predict that, you must analyze not only its equipment and doctrine but also its ability to undertake complex operations, its unglamorous but crucial logistical needs and structure, and the commitment of its soldiers to fight and die in the specific war being waged. Most important, you have to think about how it will perform when a competent enemy fires back. As Mike Tyson so eloquently put it, “Everyone has a plan until they are punched in the mouth.”

What we are seeing today in Ukraine is the result of a purportedly great military being punched in the mouth. The resilience of Ukrainian resistance is embarrassing for a Western think-tank and military community that had confidently predicted that the Russians would conquer Ukraine in a matter of days. For years, Western “experts” prattled on about the Russian military’s expensive, high-tech “modernization.” The Russians, we were told, had the better tanks and aircraft, including cutting-edge SU-34 fighter bombers and T-90 tanks, with some of the finest technical specifications in the world. The Russians had also ostensibly reorganized their army into a more professional, mostly voluntary force. They had rethought their offensive doctrine and created battalion tactical groups, flexible, heavily armored formations that were meant to be key to overwhelming the Ukrainians. Basically, many people had relied on the glamour of war, a sort of war pornography, to predict the outcome of Russia’s invasion of its neighbor.

Those predictions, based on alluring but fundamentally flawed criteria, have now proved false. Western analysts took basic metrics (such as numbers and types of tanks and aircraft), imagined those measured forces executing Russian military doctrine, then concluded that the Ukrainians had no chance. But counting tanks and planes and rhapsodizing over their technical specifications is not a useful way to analyze modern militaries. As The Atlantic’s Eliot Cohen has argued, the systems that the West used to evaluate the Russian military have failed nearly as comprehensively as that military has.

Though analysts and historians will spend years arguing about exactly why prewar assessments of the Russian military proved so flawed, two reasons are immediately apparent. First, Western analysts misunderstood the Russian military’s ability to undertake the most complex operations and the robustness of its logistical capabilities. And second, prognosticators paid too little attention to the basic motivations and morale of the soldiers who would be asked to use the Russian military’s allegedly excellent doctrine and equipment.

Russia’s problems executing complex operations became obvious almost immediately after its army crossed the border into Ukraine. For instance, many observers believed that the large, advanced Russian air force would quickly gain air dominance over Ukraine, providing the Russian land forces with support while severely limiting the Ukrainians’ movement. Instead, the Ukrainians have put in place a far more sophisticated than expected air-defense system that stymied Russian air efforts from the start. By challenging the Russians in the air, the Ukrainians have shown that Russia’s army cannot efficiently conduct the complex air operations needed to seize air supremacy from a much smaller enemy. Russia’s logistical system has been, if anything, even worse. Russian trucks are poorly maintained, poorly led, and too few in number. Once the Russian forces advanced, they found that bringing up the supplies needed to keep them moving forward became more and more difficult. Many advances, most famously the 40-mile column of vehicles stretching down to Kyiv from Belarus, simply stopped.

At the same time, the supposedly professional volunteer Russian soldiers were confused as to what they were doing, totally unprepared to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance, and, from photo evidence, surprisingly willing to abandon even the most advanced Russian equipment almost untouched. As the war has gone on, and Russian casualties have mounted, Russian soldiers have fallen victim to frostbite, refused to follow orders, and, in at least one episode, tried to kill their superior officers.

More of the Western experts who study Russia’s armed forces could and should have anticipated these problems. The Russian military has not been asked to undertake complex technological or logistical operations for at least three decades. Its more recent military actions, such as the bombing of Syria, were quite straightforward operations, in which aircraft could be used to terrorize an enemy that could not efficiently fire back.

To truly understand a military’s effectiveness, analysts must investigate not only how it looks on a spreadsheet but also how it may function in the chaos and pressure of a battlefield. War is an extremely difficult and complex business. Western strategists cannot go back in time and alter their earlier assessments. Any system with a widespread consensus that an excellent and modernized Russian military would conquer Ukraine in a matter of days is a system in crisis. We can, and must, try to do better next time. If world leaders have a better understanding of the potential difficulties of any war in East Asia, for example, perhaps they will realize how hard the outcome of such a confrontation is to predict. If the Chinese tried an amphibious landing on Taiwan, for instance, they would be undertaking maybe the most complex wartime operation, and one that their military has never attempted before. I can’t tell you what would happen, but I know it would not go according to plan. War never does.",b6ba56f8eff9c42a4bed049427731ead99ef3167,True,False,,,,,0,1648757580,,0,{},i2w5bsh,True,t3_tt8iwh,False,True,t3_tt8iwh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tt8iwh/how_the_west_got_russias_military_so_so_wrong/i2w5bsh/,1648757594,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648728780.0,

IFV's are far cheaper, smaller, more versatile, and can carry firepower sometimes on par with the heavier chassis. so I think we will be seeing a transition to a bigger focus on APS systems (especially against ATGM's) and on lighter armored vehicles.

As far as T90 vs Abrams, I feel like this is growing increasingly irrelevant.

Tank vs Tank battles are rare, often anticipated and rarely happen. Tanks in history have mostly had a supporting role as indirect fire, or suppression of other vehicles, especially armored vehicles(command and control, APCs, IFVs, supply trucks, etc...)

Its been speculated that the MBT just might be obsolete, as ordinance is getting better, easier, and more precise, so medium-size arms on medium sized aircraft, such as drones might take over this role, as well as infantry anti-tank/vehicle weapons.

Again, as far as Abrams vs T-whatever, they vary in tactics as Russian and US doctrine are different. Russians favor up close assault weapons, and the US prefers long range standoff weapons.

But even in the case of an Abrams that moves especially fast, with especially long range and shoot and move capabilities, that might not save it from a drone strike, especially with thin armor on the top as its designed to stop rounds from other tanks and ground vehicles. Its certainly not faster than a drone, and while its possible to hide a tank, and set up ambushes with one, its certainly not the ideal tool for that.

Take Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

If I were in charge of Russia's armed forces and were presented with the _perfect_ plan to dismantle an army made of Soviet gear, I would come up with a cost effective method to neutralise that attack.

I couldn't believe it when it turned out that Russia had clearly done _no such thing_ in the 30 years between desert Storm and Ukraine.

It's insane. Where's the massive SEAD/DEAD operation?
Where's the combined arms thrust North to South made with BTGs, beating the brush to flush out the national guard. Separate west Ukraine from east Ukraine.

Cut off the entire troops in the east and force a surrender.

Then do the same to cut off west Ukraine from East Poland.

So in other words they want to try and go on the offense again... after they've dug in... I mean its doable and maybe suggests they were trying to get their supply situation in order in the North.   


However now their are reports of them ferrying equipment north west up their front to their rear lines in the area which suggests they are retreating? **Honestly I just think we dont have enough facts right now to discern what's happening north of Kyiv.**

I've been thinking the thing. And while the Russians are repositioning their forces to the South, the Ukrainians will be pressing them on other fronts. 

&gt;Ukraine will probably find it harder to replace lost equipment than Russia will.

Agreed. Ukraine has captured a large quantity of Russian vehicles though, including over 100 tanks. I'm not sure how much of that captured equipment will be usable though. The biggest issue I can see is AA equipment. I'm sure Ukraine has lost a ton of it, and without getting proper replacements that could have a huge impact on the war. 

&gt; Russia's best chance of success is to wait another couple of months to rebuild and rearm their divisions, while attempting to attrition Ukraine with constant bombardment of its infrastructure and military units.

Agree completely. That's the war I expect Russia wants to fight, but it won't be possible until they take the Donbas which is unlikely for months. 

&gt;This is an ideal scenario for Russia though and excludes difficulties with re-activating reserve equipment, political and social unrest due to sanctions, all of which would tip the balance towards Ukraine and help them get a better negotiated settlement.

This is the biggest question mark imo. How long will this conflict last? Will both sides seek a ceasefire or come to terms in a few weeks/months?

Assault Pioneers are a particular Canadian/Commonwealth thing. Similar really to the whole ""Sapper Leadership Course"" that the US Offers. Essentially, Pioneers or Assault Troops are Infanteers or Armoured soldiers trained in basic engineering tasks, like demolitions or field construction. Also, Pioneers used to have the monopoly on beards. (The meme worthy 'Lumberjack Commando' picture was of soldiers of the Royal Canadian Regiment's pioneer platoon) - An Infantry Battalion essentially has a Platoon of these personnel for organic engineer taskings. (Which is thankfully coming back into vogue in Canada - Rather than abusing Engineers to do those taskings)

Pioneers can also be used as well, in relationship to a labour force under the command and direction of engineers. The UK for the longest time had a Royal Pioneer Corps, who essentially served as labourers under the direction of Combat Engineers. They were the people who dug ditches, provided defense and employment platoons for higher headquarters.

I came up with this structure, as a thought exercise, quite quickly. Looking at their geography, and the numbers. I think that, if they decided on an end state, they could find things. I also, wanted to be ""realistic"", based on their capacity, as well as thinking of what a mass of people could do, and some sort of requirement.  Also, it would give them a structure to start ""targeted recruitment"". For example, if they said they need a mass of staff officers, I would go. Or if they said they need people who were combat engineers to provide training and form engineering units.

As another thought experiment, I actually came up with an idea of a 'mixed' rescue and civil defense task organization. To provide support and assistance to the civil population. Which also could be a use for people. However that was more a paper exercise, based on my studies of cold war civil defense and military aide to the civil authorities/ aide to the civil power.

I never, met anyone who joined any military outside of me, who wanted to be the Assistant Deputy Assistant G3 For Photocopier operations, or who wanted to be the Range Control driver, or the potato peeler. However, it's an essential part of soldering. I can understand the allure of wanting to have a knife between the teeth jumping out of planes, eating snakes and engaging the enemy with trick jump shots deep behind enemy lines. 

Soldering is more than that. While there is a need for the tip of the spear, those elite types who get all the medals. There's a lot of mundane to war in reality.. *""What did you do in the war daddy?"" ""Well, I sat in a timber bunker watching a set of woods for 6 months and walked through a set of woods.""* or ""*I was the storeman at an Infantry Training centre and ensured troops in training had uniforms.""* (My grandfather did that in WW2, my grand uncle worked literally for the Stationary Department for the RCAF, ensuring bases had paper and pens.)

**That is essential, needed work.** 

**I would never refer to it as for washouts.** Those people would be doing a task to free up personnel to do other work, or they have reached a certain level of capability. Also, it would allow for a longer training pipeline, to build capability. Too many people think that war is high intensity. The maintenance of a reserve is critical. Just because a war is on, does not mean that one has to look only at today. 

I said here before, individually training someone to do basic infantry tasks, or basic tasks such as a gun number do not take long. Unit and collective training, and bringing them up to a standard do take time, resources and equipment. The last 20 years have warped a lot of people's perspectives I think. The idea that an Infanteer needs 30 weeks of basic and trade training, with a 6 month to 1 year pre-deployment cycle for a 6 month deployment to be employable is a bit gold-plated.

I think as time goes on, more information will be released on their plans. A lot of the people who went over feel to me, to be the hyper-masculine light-infantryman types that the last 20 years of Conflict have created. A lot of people I think followed them thinking that they could do that too. However, as has been said, this is not Afghanistan, or Iraq, where there is rapid medical evacuation to a cutting edge hospital, enablers, fast air and artillery. Where assaults will hold to evacuate wounded. This is more traditional infantry tasks, in an area where one does not operate from a huge base with little risk of indirect fire or air attack.",f46e6701d35a3b24352cba7c2149018ec8fc62fe,True,False,,,,,0,1648749834,,0,{},i2vlale,False,t3_tlwb05,False,True,t1_i2umdy8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tlwb05/lessons_from_finland_for_ukraine_and_its_foreign/i2vlale/,1648749854,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648721034.0,

Folks need to rethink this. Couple of points for you to ponder:

* Putin refused to annex these regions. (Still refusing to)

* The little green men from Crimea never showed up.

* Ukrainians were beating back separatists up until 2015, when Putin finally did put together pro-russian counter-offensive

As the story goes, after annexation of Crimea, Strelkov assembled 50 fighters and went to Donbass, under false belief that Putin will attempt to annex the entirety of Ukraine. As we have witnessed Putin was actually very cold toward that idea. 

But Russians let the situation unfold because it hurt Ukraine. At some point they realized Ukrainians will take back the separatists regions, at which point they removed Strelkov (so as not to cause any unnecessary farther escalation by a rogue agent), and then they froze the conflict until 2022.

You may not agree with that, but all facts point exactly to that.

So you've got prior interventions that happened to work, which further cements that bias. ""Hey, this approach worked last time."" The failure is in catching when intervention *won't* work.

However, I do not find it hard to believe that a new system developed to succeed and old (and very successful) system would end up being total shit, despite being far better on paper. This happens all the time in many different areas of design and production; think about car models that end up completely sucking, or how every other version of windows seems to be total trash, etc etc. The S-400 was developed in the 90's and given the state of the Russian Federation at that point and since then I would be completely unsurprised if its development was a cluster fuck of corruption and bureaucratic incompetence that produced something incapable of performing anywhere near its theoretical capabilities in the real world. 

Note this entry from the wikipedia page: 
&gt; In 2003, it became apparent that the system was not ready for deployment. In August, two high-ranking military officials expressed concern that the S-400 was being tested with ""obsolete"" interceptors from the S-300P system and concluded that it was not ready for deployment.[6] The completion of the project was announced in February 2004. In April, a ballistic missile was successfully intercepted in a test of the upgraded 48N6DM missile.[7][8] In 2007, the system was approved for service.

Now, that is just an issue that we know about. How much don't we know? Moreover, again, complex operations are hard; it would not at all be surprising if a system designed to use multiple missiles against multiple targets only ever gets tested for one kind of use at a time in a lab environment under perfect conditions with everything set up perfectly ahead of time for the operators by the design engineers - something that would not be surprising in Russia, going solely by how they run their real-world training and live fires. Such testing does not translate to the system actually being able to quickly, easily, and effectively change between and utilize multiple types of missiles against multiple types of targets, and especially not when being set up and operated by an average military crew, rather than the design engineers. Patriot is very simple and easy to use on paper, but you would not believe how quickly actually getting it to work as designed for anything but the most basic of tasks becomes a tangled complicated mess of high-level maintenance and arcane operator knowledge.

Cynically speaking, the loss of life and fortune is lamentable, but there are advantages to letting Russia wear itself out in Ukraine. Best case scenario for the West is it causes Putin to be removed from power via coup or revolution due to unrest/elite dissatisfaction. IF Ukraine holds, the worst case scenario is the Russian state has spent an ungodly amount of money on this misadventure and sustained economic damage that may take years to recover from. If Ukraine survives relatively intact and the frozen conflict that has been going on since 2014 ends then there’s probably no question in the West’s mind that the gamble was worth it. 

Plus, showing your hand to Russia as deterrence only works if you think Russia will be deterred forever after. “If Putin doesn’t invade today, then why not tomorrow?” Just because this coup attempt was foiled doesn’t mean the next one would’ve been. The conflict was frozen for almost a decades and could’ve remained frozen for years to come. Now at least, there’s the possibility of some kind of resolution, for better or worse.

Also though, alternatively, and this is probably most relevant, we have no idea when any counterintelligence might’ve learned of this supposed coup, or the strength of the evidence for it, or the manner in which it was averted and what kind of timetable that required. It could’ve been several months ago or even when Biden started sending out warnings just prior to the invasion. It’s possible the coup was the intelligence he was referring to back in February and why he and the administration were so loathe to provide details. It could’ve been the case that it was a warning/deterrence to Putin just as much as it was a warning to the West. It seems likely though that Putin didn’t guess the extent of the intelligence the US had, i.e., the coup plot, and chose to invade anyway.

If the coup attempt was real and truly was foiled by the US/NATO/Ukraine then Biden was almost certainly hinting at his hand back in Feb.

When I heard the reports of there being a Foriegn legion I got the bright idea to attempt going into the legion myself for glory, and to try regaining some self respect from washing out of the Army the first time.  However reports from a couple of buddies of second, well third hand information seems to have lined up well enough here. They gave me information on their losses for the legion, and how a good 100 of them went out, being airstruck at their OSUT by a cruise missile or two. 

Looking at Finland now seeing as it is probably next got me searching for their foriegn legion, which lead me here. I got some people that are somewhat depending on me to get them out of finland when the war starts. However recently it became apparent they can get themselves out if they leave some people behind. With connections there, and wanting to enter service, Finland sounds like a great idea at this point as Army recruiters and more so Civilian officials are failing to provide proper paperwork to allow me to rejoin the US army.


However your points on wash outs makes me wonder how many others are looking to go there for the same or more fantastical reasoning such as glory. You're right, there would be little to no glory there being part of it. Would be similar to a national guard if anything, a coast guard sort of situation like what we have inside US broders, or a border patrol if nothing else. With the lack of men, washouts may make the remaining goals for recruitment for the legion.

We should leave open the possibility that NATO/Ukrainian counterintelligence was just that good. After all, they've been preparing for this very fight for 8 years themselves.

Are you implying Ukrainian intelligence utilized turned assets to convince the Russians a coup was at hand and goad them to invade? Because that's wildly risky, and overly complex. Maybe the goal wasn't to goad Russia into an invasion - why feed them information that a coup was imminent? That seems like it could backfire pretty easily. Ultimately, if Ukraine *wasn't* actively feeding them information on an imminent coup, the failure still rests on Russian intelligence structures. 


The far simpler answer is institutional incompetence. Incompetence does not imply stupidity. There are obvious flaws with autocratic governments that have conflicting incentives - a military intelligence structure that is independent enough to provide useful, unbiased analysis is also a political risk.

Undoubtedly there are some elements of successful counterintelligence at play here, but the ultimate failure of the Russians appears to be a political inability to provide accurate information to its leadership.",441a7982add73dbf68d97ca9828b0f470f34586b,True,False,,,,,0,1648736236,,0,{},i2um2x8,False,t3_tsyhsy,False,True,t1_i2ugao7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tsyhsy/ukraine_megathread_march_31/i2um2x8/,1648736248,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648707436.0,

[],False,,NutDraw,,,[],,,,text,t2_ir5jw,False,False,"Reposting a comment a made late last night in response to some speculation about why Russia seems to have failed so spectacularly in the last megathread. Curious as to what the more seasoned analysts think so giving it its own post today for discussion.

&gt;Some have suggested an FSB coup gone bad, and the ~150,000 Russian troops were intended to shore up the coup and crush desultory military resistance after the Ukrainian military lost all central cohesion.

I think there's a reasonable amount of evidence for this. So to your question, how did they misjudge so badly? The working theory of this armchair analyst, which I'm aware is nearly impossible to prove at this point, is that this may be the fallout of one of the most successful counterintelligence operations in modern history.

You might say, ""Nutdraw, that sounds like pure speculation."" Well, to be honest a fair amount is. But if we go with the failed coup theory, that strongly implies Russia obviously thought they had sympathetic elements within Ukraine that would rise up when the invasion started. Those never materialized. For an operation of this size and importance, that would have meant the extensive curation of assets over years, not just a few individuals. If they pursued this, those assets were all turned or neutralized without the Kremlin ever knowing at the time of the invasion. That's the bread and butter of counterintelligence.

My second line of evidence comes from the apparent lack of effective hybrid warfare by Russia. This was supposedly Russia's specialty, and a capability they openly bragged about. One would have expected massive cyber attacks on communications, infrastructure, etc. at the start of the invasion to maximize chaos and disrupt the Ukrainian response to the invasion. This too failed to materialize. I don't think this is because they didn't try. Granted, Russia has made **a ton** of bad decisions this campaign, but it seems insane this wasn't a component of any Russian invasion; coup or not. They've been so successful with it in the past there's little reason to believe they wouldn't have tried again this time. If they tried and failed, nobody actually has any incentive to openly discuss it. Russia wouldn't want to admit failure, while Ukraine and her allies wouldn't want to reveal their capabilities and there are advantages to leaving Russia wondering what went wrong. Countering these types of hybrid warfare can also fall under the purview of counterintelligence.

To me, many of Russia's mistakes make a lot more sense if you see it as a coup foiled by successful counterintelligence. The force composition, the disjointed operations, the apparent lack of logistical planning, lack of obvious cyberwarfare, etc. and even attempting to do it in the first place points to a confidence that a bunch of VDV in strategic locations could establish control over the country. Hubris is a likely candidate for that assumption, but I fear it's a little too eager to attribute all of their failings to incompetence.

It's easy, fun even, to just think the Russians were just incredibly stupid. While quite possible, and objectively in some instances they were, it just seems unlikely to me they'd both behave so out of character and misjudge things on so many levels in areas where they've shown prior competence. We should leave open the possibility that NATO/Ukrainian counterintelligence was just that good.

You will the find the same explanation for this in the reason why Argentina decides to be so antagonistic with the US and with Europe overall. (Coincidentally the period in which Argentina was at the top of its relationships with USA also matches the same period in which Russia was at the top of its relationships with the West: The 90s). The reason is the way most of the population perceives the West and their values regarding economics/society. Look at this:

https://news.gallup.com/poll/107599/russians-sold-free-market-economy.aspx

This was back in 2008. Way way long before Russia went full state propaganda and started cracking down hard on dissidents. Imagine how it must look now. In Argentina the feelings are exactly the same.

There's some history involved with this that I'll develop further below.

Now...why is this important? When you oppose free trade and want your country to make everything (Imports substitution) and everyone to buy your stuff you start framing relationships with other countries as a zero-sum game. You want to own everything and have everything done with national capital. Either you are selling them your stuff and you are winning or you are buying them their stuff and you are losing. If Russian capital is not the one extracting gas and selling it to Europe then we are not extracting any gas at all.

Does it actually matter whether that it would enable more jobs to be created and would make everyone richer off? No, it doesn't matter. Thus any proposal to have some of your consumed goods made abroad is going to be seen as traitorous or damaging ""the people"".

Contrast this with the European Union. To some degree, countries that accepted to join the European Union overcame this ""trap"" and became WAY richer. Look at Poland's, Czechia's, Slovenia's GDP in 1992 right after they left the COMECON. They were as poor as Africa. Now look how they are faring these days. Go and do the same for Argentina. If you search for the same kind of survey I shared that was done in Russia, but this time done in those 3 countries, you'll find they don't consider their neighbors ""competition"" or ""enemies"" (Poland to some degree with CiS is sliding back into this posture but for the moment it's not the majority).

Now, here comes the history part in why people oppose free markets and don't want to trade with others. Naturally, we would be extremely dumb if we denied the impact the Soviet Union had on people. Most of the people who live in Russia nowadays grew up or had parents who lived during the Soviet Union. There people were indoctrinated into the benefits of the proletariat dictatorship and trust me if I tell you that someone who has been hammered 24/7 with that stuff since they were 5 years old is going to start believing it when they grow up. I've seen it firsthand.

1991. The Soviet Union is dissolved. Free market and capitalism show up in Russia under the banner of Yeltsin. And it's a complete mess. Those who had the connections inside logistics or handled stuff in the Army/Intelligence apparatus start to quickly seize goods and strike deals with Western companies to give them access to stuff in return of a kickback. This last part is super important as it the reason why Russia has those oligarchs.

The state is completely absent in terms of stablishing rules and frameworks for structured competition. Pyramid schemes, in a country where people had no financial education or exposure AT ALL, are rampant (Remember that even Albania had a civil war due to all the scams being run there). People are losing savings right and left. And there are now regions in Russia rising against Moscow's rule, the army -The famous and mighty ex Soviet army- gets annihilated inside Chechnya. Terrorists attacks and mafia rule some places. All order people had during the Soviet times is long gone.

1998, the ruble is devaluated due to a financial crisis. People are left with no savings at all (those lucky few who did not had their money in banks and held foreign currency saved themselves). And now some flats explode and people are pissed as hell with everything that's happening.

Guess who comes in to save the day? You got it right. Putin comes around, puts a leash on oligarchs, destroys all insurrections and order is restored. Russia is back on the winning track.

Go too big, and it goes up in cost. It goes up in weight, ammunition size, crew size, and importance. The larger you build it, the more infrastructure you have.

Consider 105mm towed guns (Let's say the L118 Light gun), small, fast, quick into action, can fire solid shot in local defense. They also fire 17km. All in a package of 1 truck, with crew, ammunition, stores and gun. 8 crew per gun, 6-8 guns per battery, with your echelon. Again, quick to move, set up and fire. You also can carry sufficient powder and shells without too many support vehicles. At 400$ a round, it's a steal for volume.

17km range, means about 11km assuming you are 5km behind the forward line of troops supporting a brigade.  That is exceptionally good for close support, as you don't need long range observation (As said guns would be used mostly for close support of units). The mobility is key for protecting against counter-battery work, as you can set up, fire 2-3 rounds and move the detachment quickly.

Also speed of fire and close support. An Infantry Section commander can call for fire, and direct tube artillery onto a target. Or a Forward Observer, or a Mortar Fire Controller. (*Golf Wun-Wun , this is India Too-Wun Charley, Fire mission over*..) The fire mission can be called and fired within a minute or two. There is great value to having that sort of fire power on call. Either for illumination, smoke, or HE. 

The larger you go, the bigger the system, the more logistics you need. Someone in the thread mentioned hoists to move ammo, the more crew, the more vehicles. Also the scarcity due to higher cost increases. That also makes a larger artillery system a more valuable target, and requires additional protection. Also, feeding it goes up. You might fire 3 rounds per day, or 400 rounds per day out of tube artillery. At 400 rounds per day, that's a lot of ammunition and powder. 

Larger artillery is more likely to be held for higher level objectives, which leaves a gap in close support to units. 105/155 as is is very good for that, especially in mobile battles. When you are in a fixed location, similar to Vietnam or Afghanistan, then you have the time, control and space to set up larger fixed batteries with rocket assistance and precision guidance that can fire a few shells out to 100km without fear or what have you. Remember, mobility is a counter. 

There is a ""place"" for larger artillery, however there is just as much of a place for smaller tube artillery with sub 30km range. Rockets require a huge trail to keep them firing.  All artillery, from 81mm mortars, to MLRS to  500000mm superguns have a place in the fire plan. All are tools in the toolbox

Another thing to think about is how flexible the west uses Artillery. One of their strengths historically is the ability to plan and call fire missions quickly, and even by the end user.  An Extra few kilometers of range doesn't help the ability to call, plan and execute rapid fire missions. Nor does it replace Forward Observers, FSCCs and other artillery observers embedded into low level units with a hot line back to the artillery.",cd0c4a5e710c2a620bfbec3c8039afccd43953f1,True,False,,,,,0,1648719430,,0,{},i2tt74s,False,t3_tqtbl6,False,True,t3_tqtbl6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqtbl6/how_much_can_the_range_of_traditional_cannon/i2tt74s/,1648719445,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648690630.0,

Yet, the umbrella was during PRC rule.

As I also stated, the premise of these actions is based on American military supremacy. Taiwanese leadership and Chinese leadership are both operating under the belief that a conflict over Taiwan will draw in the US. 

But what if this is a 50 yr affair, 100 yr affair? The belief that this will necessarily end in war is only based on the belief that the US shall remain supreme in Asia unless challenged and defeated militarily in Asia. But it's not the case. The simple proposal that if the Chinese navy has simply had the tonnage to match the USN, certainly not in any foreseeable future, but just the mental exercise that assumes that were to happen, then the US policy will necessarily be one of retrenchment and not of forwarding deployment. 

The point isn't about whether that would or will happen, but that conflict itself may not be necessary to change the political reality around Asia, and people follow political reality however much they hate it. Just like when AU realize the British Empire is no longer around, no matter how much they yearn for the motherland, they shift their strategic tie to the US. Taiwanese policymaker so long as they are made to face the political reality would shift their positions, or their constituents will make it for them.

You know what's funny, I didn't think something magically happened, I think propaganda happened. 

You on the other hand seem to think something magically happened. 

&gt;Sure. But people paid to do this are not coming up with anything mutually agreeable either.

Because these people aren't paid to come up with mutually agreeable things today. Su Qi is called a traitor in Taiwan today, he was paid 20 yrs ago to see if something can happen. And he did manage it. Neither China nor Taiwan liked the concept. In fact, BOTH sides came out repudiating it.

About the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute

&gt; Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) is an international institute based in Stockholm. It was founded in 1966[1] and provides data, analysis and recommendations for armed conflict, military expenditure and arms trade as well as disarmament and arms control. The research is based on open sources and is directed to decision-makers, researchers, media and the interested public.

&gt; SIPRI's organizational purpose is to conduct scientific research in issues on conflict and cooperation of importance for international peace and security, with the goal of contributing to an understanding for the conditions for a peaceful solution of international conflicts and sustainable peace.

Quote from the article:

&gt; The excessive focus on ‘hypersonic missiles’, particularly in some popular media, paired with a lack of understanding of the limitations of this descriptor, has meant that discussions on the risks created and possible responses have sometimes overly focused on the threat of reduced response times, or impact on missile defences and other countermeasures. Questioning why certain actors—be they states or industry—adopt this terminology can help reveal motivations and vested interests in the hype around hypersonic missiles, i.e. to appear threatening or attract funding. More informed discussions have explored, for example, the potential impact of significant manoeuvring capabilities, including target ambiguity and the evasion of radars and other sensors. In the way that it is currently being used, the term ‘hypersonic’ often has little to no meaning and at the same time fuels competitive dynamics and a fear of missing out on the technology. Overcoming this lack of nuance could help put a brake on some of the competitive dynamics and hype-driven military spending. For example, the capabilities of some existing missiles often already provide the desired capabilities. Conversely, the advantages of future hypersonic missiles over other systems are sometimes exaggerated and come with a large price tag. Considering the technical and economic challenges of developing and deploying viable hypersonic weapon systems can help inform arms control and non-proliferation efforts addressing risks posed by hypersonic missiles.",2a6d3cc9fc21b1f1a7e26227f1e88d8a4321ff33,True,False,,,,,0,1648707550,,0,{},i2tf3kh,True,t3_tstc94,False,True,t3_tstc94,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tstc94/a_matter_of_speed_understanding_hypersonic/i2tf3kh/,1648707565,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648678750.0,

[],False,,NutDraw,,,[],,,,text,t2_ir5jw,False,False,"&gt;Some have suggested an FSB coup gone bad, and the ~150,000 Russian troops were intended to shore up the coup and crush desultory military resistance after the Ukrainian military lost all central cohesion.

I think there's a reasonable amount of evidence for this. So to your question, how did they misjudge so badly? The working theory of this armchair analyst, which I'm aware is nearly impossible to prove at this point, is that this may be the fallout of one of the most successful counterintelligence operations in modern history.

You might say, ""Nutdraw, that sounds like pure speculation."" Well, to be honest a fair amount is. But if we go with the failed coup theory, that strongly implies Russia obviously thought they had sympathetic elements within Ukraine that would rise up when the invasion started. Those never materialized. For an operation of this size and importance, that would have meant the extensive curation of assets over years, not just a few individuals. If they pursued this, those assets were all turned or neutralized without the Kremlin ever knowing at the time of the invasion. That's the bread and butter of counterintelligence.

My second line of evidence comes from the apparent lack of effective hybrid warfare by Russia. This was supposedly Russia's specialty, and a capability they openly bragged about. One would have expected massive cyber attacks on communications, infrastructure, etc. at the start of the invasion to maximize chaos and disrupt the Ukrainian response to the invasion. This too failed to materialize. I don't think this is because they didn't try. Granted, Russia has made **a ton** of bad decisions this campaign, but it seems insane this wasn't a component of any Russian invasion; coup or not. They've been so successful with it in the past there's little reason to believe they wouldn't have tried again this time. If they tried and failed, nobody actually has any incentive to openly discuss it. Russia wouldn't want to admit failure, while Ukraine and her allies wouldn't want to reveal their capabilities and there are advantages to leaving Russia wondering what went wrong. Countering these types of hybrid warfare can also fall under the purview of counterintelligence.

To me, many of Russia's mistakes make a lot more sense if you see it as a coup foiled by successful counterintelligence. The force composition, the disjointed operations, the apparent lack of logistical planning, lack of obvious cyberwarfare, etc. and even attempting to do it in the first place points to a confidence that a bunch of VDV in strategic locations could establish control over the country. Hubris is a likely candidate for that assumption, but I fear it's a little too eager to attribute all of their failings to incompetence.

It's easy, fun even, to just think the Russians were just incredibly stupid. While quite possible, and objectively in some instances they were, it just seems unlikely to me they'd both behave so out of character and misjudge things on so many levels in areas where they've shown prior competence. We should leave open the possibility that NATO/Ukrainian counterintelligence was just that good. After all, they've been preparing for this very fight for 8 years themselves.",8b3f08ac5564265f622a048a74f8af49bdd260b1,True,False,,,,,0,1648706022,,0,{},i2td1b8,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t1_i2sfjba,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2td1b8/,1648706037,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648677222.0,
[],False,,Skeptical0ptimist,,,[],,,,text,t2_150m2g,False,False,"Based on what I have seen, China has capability to take Taiwan and keep US+allies away by a number of means.  The have plans for not only amphibious landing, but paratroopers and helicoptor dropping of special forces.  They also have plans to mine both entrances to Taiwan Strait to keep out both US surface vessels and US submarines.  It's possible that all of these could fail, but evidently Chinese have put a lot of thought into this problem.

Today, the only thing currently keeping China from taking Taiwan are the consequences.

I tend to think that once China decides to accept the consequences, it doesn't make sense to do blockade only.  They would throw everything they have planned for the highest chance of success in the shortest amount of time.

Also, I would like to point out that, very likely, the capture of TSMC will be useless for China.  I'm sure TSMC has plans to destroy all the photo mask sets, delete layout databases, OPC (Optical Proximity Correction) algorithms, process flows, process recipes, etc. so that all technology and design IPs are kept from Chinese if invasion looks imminent.  Also, plans to scatter key scientists and engineers into hiding.  Without these materials and people, all China will get is a building full of off-the-shelf wafer processing tools (sure, they are pricy), but they will not be able to produce any of the chips TSMC produces, or even to reverse engineer TSMC's technology.

In any case, the consequences of invasion to be imposed on China is likely to be cripling.  The worst of which would be counter-blockade.  US Navy will be able to cut off China's access to Persian Gulf petroleum and food imports easily, not many PLAN ships can operate far away from China.  China is not self-sufficient  in food production.  They need both food import as well as petroleium import for their agriculture.

[],False,,jogarz,,,[],,,,text,t2_jde8q,False,False,"Russia has always long had a bit of an identity crisis with regards to the West. On one hand, Russia shares a lot of common heritage with Europe (for instance, its Christian religious background), and historically many Russians have seen themselves as part of the European community. On the other hand, Russia has often framed itself in opposition to the West. Elements of this first appeared as opposition to Western liberalism under the Tsars, and then was made even more explicit during the Soviet era (as you can probably guess).

This conflicting identity is where the concept of ""Eurasia"", which shows up a lot in Russian thought, originates. Basically, Russia sees itself as not fully European, not fully Asian, but somewhere in between. However, Eurasia is arguably even more poorly defined than other regional identities.

Add on top of this is the trauma of lost empire. Losing your empire is always traumatic for any country. In Russia's case, it lost its empire at the end of a lengthy competition- the Cold War- with the Western bloc. Most of Russia's leaders (and in fact, much of its population, which skews older) had their formative years during and immediately after this bitter defeat.

All of these factors mean that Russia's leaders, and to a lesser extent, its population, have a certain level of reflexive hostility towards the West. They're predisposed to see the West as a rival or even an enemy, rather than a partner.

Almost all light gas guns only have those high velocities shooting into an evacuated barrel. As far as creating a light gas combustion cartridge, hydrogen is very annoying to store long term. It migrates through most materials.

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"&gt;LNG terminals can't makeup for LNG shortfall.

They're not expected to by themselves (though I also disagree that they couldn't; they definitely could, but we'll get to that). Germany consumes about 93 BCM per year, of which 55% (about 51 BCM) is imported from Russia ([ref](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-dependence-imported-fossil-fuels)). That's what needs to be replaced or reduced through efficiency improvements.

Germany also isn't trying to make up for the LNG requirements for the entirety of the EU, so your 155 BCM figure is irrelevant as far as they are concerned (though the EU overall is expecting to get about 1/3rd of their natural gas from the US ([see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd5In0rQ2gw)), largely using the 28 existing LNG terminals, many of which were running at about 1/2 capacity). Each country will obviously need to take their own measures, I'm just using Germany's situation as an example because it was specifically mentioned by the OP.

It should be noted that Germany is not expecting to need to actually import 51 BCM per year. The German government is currently financing transitions from gas heating systems to heat pump systems [[ref (German)](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Energie/0325_fortschrittsbericht_energiesicherheit.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=10)], and even if you were to burn natural gas at a gas power plant and use that to run a heat pump, it would easily be 200% more energy efficient than the maximum efficiency of burning the gas directly for heat (see an explanation of that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFEHFsO-XSI)).

On that note, 44% of natural gas in Germany is used by residences, and 90% of that is for heating ([ref](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/Energy/gas-natural-gas-supply-in-germany.html)), in other words, 40% of their natural gas is used for residential heating, or about 37 BCM. Much of this is expected to be converted to heat pump heating over the next two years, and even just a 50% conversion would reduce their deficit from cutting off Russian supplies to 32.4 BCM. Conversion of industrial heating systems as well, plus insulation improvements and smart thermostats could also provide significant improvements, and Germany is working on all of these.

Lastly, you are probably underestimating the throughput of LNG terminals. It typically takes about 20-30 hours to unload a large LNG tanker (14,000 m^3 per hour ([ref](https://germanlng.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-lng-terminal-2/))). A large LNG tanker, like a Qmax tanker (from Qatar, which is one of Germany's currently planned import partners) can hold up to 266,000 m^3 of LNG, which would expand 600x to about 160 million m^3 of natural gas. A single LNG terminal running at 75% capacity can supply 6.3 million m^3 of natural gas per hour, or about 55BCM per year.

Pipelines are definitely cheaper, I'll agree on that point, but Germany is trying to import from the US, Qatar, and the UAE, as well as from Norway and the Netherlands. EU partners could maybe get a pipeline set up in the next few years, but I doubt we're ever going to see a natural gas pipeline from the US to Germany, or from Qatar for that matter. LNG tankers make perfect sense as an interim solution while Germany transitions to renewable energy alternatives.",3cc411ca5686e28a2fa3418d5c094e4fce6bd839,True,False,,,,,0,1648688445,,0,{},i2sfwyu,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t1_i2rzfd5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2sfwyu/,1648688458,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648659645.0,

They have proven that corruption within their military is endemic and very deep. Despite their claims of having new modern weapons, the reality is their weapons are horribly maintained and their most modern equipment was being produced at such a slow pace, that it would take decades for them to be on par with the United states (who they are constantly comparing themselves against.)  


Their doctrine of combining mass conscription with special forces has only created a doctrinal contradiction where their (possibly elite) special forces are being supported by a army of barely competent conscripts. The result of that is that the regular units are very poor in quality overall and their elite troops dont have any competent support to rely on.  


Although its modernized somewhat its Airforce (seemingly) hasn't learned anything from Afghanistan. Its was still horribly ignorant of the threat of MANPADS and its pilots seem barely trained and barely competent. This is likely thanks to the lack of training they get do to the fact that most of their aircraft even in peacetime can barely be flown due to either a lack of spare parts or malfunctions.  


Overall this invasion is a catastrophically poor show of Russian military force and has done nothing other than embarrass its military on the world stage. This has the side effect of lowering their influence abroad. (Hence why Japan has recently been considering retaking some of their northern islands from Russia.)
