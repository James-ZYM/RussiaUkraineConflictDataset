Finally, there are serious concerns that China will not escape the middle-income trap, which is generally a transition from low-value add manufacturing based off cheap labour to advanced manufacturing with highly educated labour plus high value-add services (finance, law, tech, academia, media), which are all normally associated with alpha cities.

Well, that is true for all governments and all wars. If a written paper could avoid war, no war would have happened in the past 400 years. This is why diplomacy matters, to make sure that we can avoid war using constant negotiation and balancing interests. Putin may, and probably will, sign a peace treaty eventually with what is left of Ukraine. 

Force and calculations of national security determine if there will be a war. Not a piece of paper signed by two sitting presidents. And this is true not only for Putin, but for all nations of the world.

Everyone 'knew' RU would bowl right over UA because everyone *knew* that Russia had the 2nd most powerful military in the world.  

But now we *know* that Russia's military is a paper tiger.  Their units are terribly maintained and outdated, probably because the officers are selling the parts on eBay.  Their generals obviously have no idea how combined forced work or how to make a logistics pipeline.  Their communication systems are crap.  And their soldiers have no real pride to fight for cause.  

Thus the current abject failure of an invasion- politically appointed generals who couldn't win a modern war, ordering badly-maintained units crewed by unmotivated soldiers, to fight using obsolete tactics, with insecure communications and wholly inadequate support and logistics.  And a complex multi-headed operation involving armor, infantry, air, and logistics working together, is not possible for them.  

Right now, every day this fight continues is bad for Russia.  Every day Russia loses more tanks, vehicles, ordnance, money, and pushes the world farther against them.  It's the Soviet Afghan War all over again, only this time the Russians don't have a competent military.  Just like Afghanistan, in time Russia will leave Ukraine with little of value.  

And let's not forget those foreign Russian currency reserves.  Zelenskyy is doing the smart thing- trying to capture them for reparations.  I think he has a decent chance of success.  Which means UA will have tons of cash to rebuild and RU only has a broken military and decimated economy that people will be quite hesitant to do business with.  

Another thought- Right now, Putin and Russia are the same thing.  But that may not always be true.  Russian elites have gotten a taste of capitalism and they like it.  And they have to know that if this invasion continues much longer Russia will be forever a global pariah just like North Korea.  So I would bet money that right now there's multiple groups within Russia plotting to overthrow Putin.  If any of them succeed, the whole game changes.  Remove Putin, whoever follows him will almost certainly immediately declare ceasefire and try to get out of Ukraine as cleanly as possible.  
When that happens- Russia MUST pay reparations to Ukraine.  But when that happens, THEN we should negotiate with Russia to bring them back into the global economy.

Occupied Donetsk and Luhansk have long felt what Gall describes about Chechnya. As for Putin's goal, he has many goals. Historical - to become emperor of the Slavic Empire (restored Soviet Union). Strategic - dominance in the Black Sea. State - to destroy Ukrainian culture and history, which calls into question the ""supremacy"" of the Russian nation and language. Utilitarian - to remind the people of Russia that the revolt will cost them their lives. And of course economic - to capture sources of hydrocarbons. So far, none of the goals have been achieved.

Where we are seeing major advances recently is in open-air Carbon capture to fuel technology. I follow these topics closely and see a lot more development in these technologies open-air carbon capture to fuel lately.

  
Combining hydrogen produced from excess electricity then combining it will carbon pulled out from the air is less efficient than using hydrogen in fuel cells. I believe the economics will make more sense in the long term since we can simply transition existing infrastructure over to Synthetic hydrocarbons, instead of creating new infrastructure to handle hydrogen.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as materials go, it's actually the other way around. Right now Hydrogen storage and fuel cells require a lot of palladium or platinum. 

There are hints this materials problem might be solvable, but the fact that Hydrogen is still extremely inconvenient to store and transport is always looming.

While true the most energy-dense Lithium batteries use Cobalt, the amount they use is decreasing quickly, to the point the recycled cobalt from older batteries will likely sustain production or high energy density batteries. Other materials used are Nickle and magnesium which while can be expensive, are relatively abundant.

Less energy-dense batteries such as Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries are growing in the low-cost EV space.

The Iraq Body Count initiative, which is extremely critical of the invasion places ordinance caused civilian deaths to be in the 5% range of total fatalities. The primary cause of death is execution after capture which was exclusively partisan and terrorist led efforts. 

Which makes the death toll from bombing something in the 5-10,000 range, which is already getting close to what the Russian army has achieved in Ukraine.

The view is fine though it makes me question whether the views presented are merely views rather than facts. My utmost apologies to OP if untrue. OP, if you could, please educate by presenting some articles or points of evidence to substantiate these opinions. 

Here are my thoughts: 

Three consecutive administrations (Obama, Trump, Biden) has endorsed a pivot to Asia militarily. Biden may be distracted by Russia but this is a mid-term blip in the trend. If they pull out of Japan, then the island chain thinking is more-or-less useless thus one less reason to defend Taiwan. And even if US leaves Japan, CCP controls Chinese media and will still make US and JP to be the bad guys.

I think your argument on North Korea not putting much of a fight is inaccurate. Even if a good number of NK artillery fails, it could still destroy significant parts of Seoul. So despite South Korea disliking Japan, they want US in the region and based in Japan too. Also SK planners probably won't forget China fought on the side of NK.

The US has given up on liberalizing China and I believe this was a failed experiment. From the beginning, China has played the West well on this and knowing the Chinese mentality this was easy to see for an Asian audience. China is known for long-term thinking and that's why they have become a success. My opinion now though is that they're becoming more short-term with their tactics (e.g. wolf warrior diplomacy).",5edab5405a3d392374b09bd8491d55f3c9138282,True,False,,,,,0,1648715824,,0,{},i2tp23k,False,t3_tsstpi,False,True,t3_tsstpi,/r/geopolitics/comments/tsstpi/us_military_out_of_japan/i2tp23k/,1648715844,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648687024.0,[],text,t2_jopy7,False,False,

The deforestation of Solomon Islands, the propping up of dictators with Chinese cash and the wholesale destruction of fisheries throughout the region backed up by thuggish Chinese coast guard vessels ramming local boats that are the livelihoods of local people and very expensive for them to repair. Not to mention pristine reefs buried with sand to make artificial islands for the Chinese military to extend their control. To me, this is the most beautiful part of the world and it is covered in Chinese waste and disregard for the natural environment, corruption and supremacism over locals. Suharto came to power amid a Chinese backed coup attempt which almost turned Indonesia into another communist hellhole.

I don't know if you have spent any time in China but I have, and the culture there is cutthroat, racist to the core, and solely concerned with wealth accumulation and to hell with everything else. They try to turn these other countries that they set up operations in onto that and you can see it everywhere you look. Hainan used to be beautiful, lush and tropical and now it is a dump filled with trash and casinos and a lot of truly insufferable people. They would do that to Taiwan in a heartbeat. Sorry if that upsets you but that is because you have no idea, at all. You might get it one day.

And when Taiwanese overthrew their oppressors they carried their severed heads through town singing songs. I have seen reenactments and heard those songs. More recently, Taiwan's oppressors have had their grasp forcibly removed through political reforms and transitional justice. You may not like the former's methods, but you have to understand them.

I don't want anybody to die, I just want to see some respect for indigenous people and their land. And some people don't seem capable of showing respect. Look at Ukraine. Do you think they were ever going to get respect from Russians? Well, they will now. And do you think Taiwanese will ever get any respect from Chinese? Now ask yourself why on earth you ever thought they had any respect for people among the islands of southeast Asia.

Putin's speech he made declaring the 'special military operation' (read: invasion/war) against Ukraine:

“Today, I again consider it necessary to come back to the tragic events taking place in the Donbas and the key issue of ensuring Russian security. Let me start with what I said in my address of February 21. I am referring to what causes us particular concern and anxiety – those fundamental threats against our country that year after year, step by step, are offensively and unceremoniously created by irresponsible politicians in the West.  
“I am referring to the expansion of the NATO to the east, moving its military infrastructure closer to Russian borders. It is well known that for 30 years we have persistently and patiently tried to reach an agreement with the leading NATO countries on the principles of equal and inviolable security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we constantly faced either cynical deception and lies, or attempts to pressure and blackmail, while NATO, despite all our protests and concerns, continued to steadily expand.

Very few countries supported the US in the invasion, unlike Afghanistan, and the UK government in particular paid a heavy price with Tony Blair's legacy pretty much destroyed by it.

People tend to think it had wider support than it actually did because coalition forces came afterwards in an attempt to stabilise Iraq.

But Iraq is far away from any western country both geographically and culturally. Most people also despised Saddam Hussein and the US was the global hegemon. So there was much less appetite to sacrifice for it.

This time western people relate to Ukraine, like its leader, the war is ""next door"" and Russia is only a regional power unlike the US or China. So the consequences for economic action are much less. Furthermore the only thing stopping western nations doing a desert storm style campaign against Russia are the nukes.

Ok so in terms of roles at thinktanks, there are several different kinds but I'll keep focused on research (won't mention stuff like development which is crucial for thinktanks but I don't think that's what you're asking about). There's your basic analyst role and that's usually at a commercial think tank like Rhodium or RAND. If you're already working, going into those kinds of positions are your best bet.

However, other entry positions would be research assistants for big name ppl at think tanks. My friend started off as Ryan Hass' assistant and then moved into a Congressperson's office as their FP advisor so you can def move into actual policy.

If you want to leveret your existing experience, there's a couple ways depending on the product you're on and your current role at your desk. For example, munis would be super helpful and you could prob get an above entry role at a thinktank dealing with state and municipal funding.

However, let's say your experience at whatever BB you're at right now is useless. Then your breaking in depends if you have any IR research experience. If you can leverage that, you can prob get into a good Congressional office/thinktank. Most of the friends and colleagues I mentioned above went straight from undergrad to working in IR. 

Definitely leverage university prof relationships to see what's out there. I still keep in touch with my Columbia profs and they're super generous with sending any opps they know of my way.

Worst case scenario if you have nothing is to go back to school to get an MPA or some graduate degree. 

Also, going into these positions as you know is going to be a major pay cut compared to what we're used to (which is why I haven't made the switch yet despite a lot of opportunities out there) and if you have a family, it may complicate things.",1468c11db4a4834be09ea9434c4211b0bfd2e233,True,False,,,,,0,1648691699,,0,{},i2sn3e4,False,t3_tqaqxt,False,False,t1_i2skvvz,/r/geopolitics/comments/tqaqxt/johns_hopkins_sais_vs_georgetown_msfs/i2sn3e4/,1648691715,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648662899.0,[],text,t2_dboe9zrj,False,False,
