[],False,,valewolf,,,[],,,,text,t2_60lqwlrp,False,False,"I’m gonna assume you’re talking about the 2003 Iraq invasion cause the 1991 invasion was done with massive international support cause Saddam brutally annexed it’s smaller neighbor and needed to be stopped. The Afghanistan invasion was done with the support of the afghan government mostly cause it was a counter taliban effort, not an invade and fight the internationally recognized government thing. 

So assuming it’s the 2003 invasion. The leader of Iraq at that point was still Saddam. The same dude who brutally invaded Kuwait a decade earlier, entire international community recognized him and his government as a piece of shit still for that. The us invading Iraq is more similar to if 10 years from now someone invaded Russia. Even if it’s not right, people remember the bullshit that same government did recently and see it more as karma than some unprovoked attack. 

Another major difference is that Russia is actually annexing territory like Crimea which gives the whole developed world scary ww2 flashbacks. The US never had any intention of annexing any of the countries it attacked which makes it very different from an international relations standpoint. 

Also the fact that Ukrainians instantly and violently are rejecting the Russian takeover. During the Iraq invasion most Iraqi citizens hated their government anyways and were not interested for the most part in fighting to uphold it unlike in Ukraine. The real insurgency In Iraq only started a year or 2 maybe after the us already took the country and dissatisfaction mounted. Many Iraqis were perfectly fine watching the us free them from Saddam until their lives failed to improve 1 or 2 years into the occupation",f1a56fc640d52a4daa235853c04bf8a1317ef8b7,True,False,,,,,0,1652566427,,0,{},i8mkjp5,False,t3_uphqb4,False,True,t3_uphqb4,/r/war/comments/uphqb4/double_standards/i8mkjp5/,1652566438,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1652537627.0

Also these countries tend to not be allies with the countries you’re talking about, my understanding is that sanctions will usually only get thrown around when an ally is being attacked. In this case, Ukraine is in alliance with dozens of major countries, so there’s gonna be a more predictable response than if a country with few allies was attacked.

Russia will ignore the West towards Lviv due to being too close to Poland. Putin is an INTJ like myself. His backup plans are set in stone. 

NATOs toppling of governments through proxies and interfering will take a huge blow this decade. China, Russia and Iran will see to it.

Frist, being recognized as terrorists by the US or EU isn't necessarily a good thing. They both do what's in their own interest, they're not a reference to decide who's a terrorist or not.  
Second, this is a war. Unfortunately they are war crimes and I'm pretty sure PKK members committed atrocities. But Turkey also did and does. If PKK are terrorists for this reason, so is the turkish state.  
Finally, I'm tired of hearing that PKK is the same as ISIS. Please, PKK is fighting armed forces while ISIS walks in the streets of Paris shooting random civilians. ISIS claim they want a totalitarian islamic state, while PKK claim they want a more direct democratic society. Don't get me wrong, I don't support the PKK, but they don't fit the definition of ""terrorists"", while ISIS does. They are more like rebels, paramilitary group, guerilla, but not ""terrorists"".
