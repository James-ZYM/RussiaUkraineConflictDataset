&gt; LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine, March 6 - The number of Ukrainian refugees was expected to reach 1.5 million on Sunday as Russia continued its attack 11 days after invading Ukraine and Kyiv pressed for further Western action, including more sanctions and weapons.

&gt; In Kherson, southern Ukraine, the only regional capital to have changed hands since the invasion, several thousand people demonstrated on its main square on Saturday, chanting &amp;quot;Kherson is Ukraine&amp;quot; and demanding Russian forces withdraw.

&gt; Concerns over nuclear dangers remained after Russia seized Ukraine&amp;#039;s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with a top U.S. official saying on Friday that Russian troops were 20 miles from Ukraine&amp;#039;s second-largest nuclear facility.

They'll even be watching Fox news and talking about other peoples ""propaganda"" it's terrifying to see. 

Every form of media is injected with opinions and they start to grow on you. At this day and age media is being weaponized in the U.S. even. I will follow a story through a few common brainwashing news outlets and then move on to some ""unbiased"", smaller news teams and then follow even a few ""fringe"" people before I try and seperate  what's really going on.

You have to almost build a filter and think to yourself ""hmm what is this news team want you to leave here with? What's their target audience? How do they want me to feel after seeing this?"" And proceed with critical thought to try and unwind the story and what's really going on. 

Propaganda and brainwashing techniques are real and when someone tells you something enough you start to believe it. There have been alot of stuff in the .media as of lately who do their best to spread fear and push a narrative. Unfortunately it's your job as the consumer to see through the BS which gets thicker and thicker.

The minute he started saying it like it was, China put the screws on him... just like they arrested two Canadians on espionage out of nothing but sheer retaliation.  That is the sort of country it is.  Corrupt to the bone, and now he feels bad that he did not have the courage to say the truth earlier in his video career... sometimes that kind of stuff lives with you and eats at your conscience and when he decided that he wanted to say it like it was.

I don't agree with the guy on many issues, and I think he has a huge ego, but like I said earlier, to do what he does, you need to have confidence in yourself.  The things that bother me most about him, and in fact lots of South Africans I meet, is that apartheid is still ingrained in their heads from childhood.  They try not be racist cause they know that is the right thing to do, but deep down inside they still are.  They still believe  in superiority of one race over the other.   The walk they walk to not be racist, they feel is a gift to the minorities out of the goodness of their heart.   Not something minorities have a right to.   When a racists incident happens that pushes their beliefs, their deep ingrained views show their ugly side.  

...but like I said, South Africa ingrained that into people they force fed it to you its not easy to change and when you see a man trying to do just that, you have to respect it even if you feel that a lot of it is window dressing, because they know what is right and wrong and are trying their best to live up to those standards.

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

He's shown support for Yeonmi Park and other people who knowingly spread disinformation.  He's been openly racist when talking about his life in South Africa, and has some questionable views in the thousands of hours of video that he talks in.

As far as criticism he receives sure its mostly from cpc trolls and wumao crazies but they actually point out a few things that I never noticed in my years of watching him and Laowhy.  I used to be a big fan, even went on this guy Nathan Rich's video to defend them as he made a few videos making fun of/criticizing them.

It wasn't until I noticed what American Uncensored was about, learned about epoch times and saw how they share stories/have crossover with ADV(serpentza and laowhy) that I realized how much of an idiot I was for not seeing it sooner.

I know Russia's army *in theory, SHOULD be* far more capable than what we are seeing on the news.  *In theory*, the sheer weight of metal they've thrown at UA *SHOULD* be able to punch in one side of the country and out the other.  Should.  
But they're not fighting their equipment anywhere close to effectively.  It's like someone ordered up a mass of metal and forgot all the details- tanks need fuel, soldiers need food (and TRAINING), and you should collect some intel first to see what you're walking into.  

It's like whoever is in command there not only has no experience but no strategic training also.  Thus we have these really stupid mistakes like 20+km long columns with no dispersion on roads that haven't been secured for their passage, without enough fuel to reach their objective.  
The soldiers seem to have no idea what they do or why they do it, just 'officer says go that way so we go that way and ended up here'.  The result is that the hardware being deployed is not used effectively.  

And let's not forget the unencrypted comms- if Russia is so well equipped and capable, why do we hear their tactical chatter on unencrypted sideband radios?

The Average age of a Russian male is 71, Putin is 69. He was a KGB officer in Berlin, when the wall fell, he saw his country fall apart, crack wide open. 

He's gone from that, to one of the most powerful men in the world surrounded by yes men. Also probably the richest man in the world off the books. Anything he wants he gets, When he plays hockey with his Belarusian buddy , the other hockey players aren't allowed to touch them And anytime they shoot at net the goalie can only make a half assed attempt to block it. He hasn't lived in reality for decades.  

Now he's at the end of his life and the one thing he can not get is more time, No amount of money, so science, no prayer, no military, nothing can get him what he wants.  

What happens to country when the singular head of state has a mental breakdown and he's surrounded by yes men who have NEVER stood up to him or said no.

Has nobody in the Russain government watched American news in the last 20 years? do they not see you can't beat a determined people, Russia's own history in Afghanistan should have told them taking Ukraine would extract a heavy toll.

Once the process starts, the costs are always lower for being the first to strike, which both sides know, and even though they know that whoever strikes first will still be devastated, the game theoretic nature of the conflict forces both sides to increased readiness, provoking the other, until both sides launch. 

The only reliable way to prevent this is to maintain a lower level of tension. 

A no fly zone is worth considering, but there's every reason to believe it will start that process.

In a press release issued Monday afternoon, York Regional Police said the victim was driving in the Bathurst Street and Steeles Avenue area when a red Range Rover cut them off and stopped in the middle of a live lane of traffic.  
  
“A male suspect got out of the Range Rover and tore a Ukraine flag off of the victim’s vehicle and smashed one of the vehicle windows,” the release reads.  
  
Police said the man may also be involved in “at least one other incident” in Toronto. He has been charged with mischief under $5,000.  
  
“The motivation for the Saturday incident is still under investigation as the suspect is not of Eastern European descent and suffers from a significant mental health issue,” the release said.  
  
Police said the 32-year-old man from Markham “will not be named for this reason.”

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

&gt; Ukraine is offering amnesty plus five million rubles to anyone who deserts from the Russian army and agrees to go to a Ukrainian prison. That’s about $48,000, probably several years’ pay for a young Russian worker.

&gt; On the surface, this sounds like a sweet deal, but on reflection, it’s anything but. Put yourself in the shoes of a Russian soldier. First, you have to elude the Russian Army, knowing you could be shot for desertion. Then, you have to surrender without getting killed by Ukrainians. After that, you’re stuck in prison; maybe they’ll deposit you in a regular POW camp, complete with Russian loyalists ready to kill you when the guard’s not looking. Wherever you languish, you know your fate hinges on the outcome of the war.

You can do an internet search and see what sort of activism they’ve been involved in over the years.

Many do not understand that and have been critical of this new activism, but it just shows you that despite all the “sex tapes” leading to “reality tv” billionaire empires and twerking becoming a dance that kids do with their grandparents over breakfast tik-tok viral videos, sex is *still* largely taboo in 2022.
