I think we at times fool ourselves with the positive news. Russia sure has lost a lot more than it expected, but how much will their power really have changed from this?

The EU and the US send a lot of material but how much of this won't just end up in Russia's hands? We've sent several thousands of anti-air but how many aircraft have been shot down since then? If Ukraine eventually capitulates, they might be picking up thousands of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons to be used against western forces.

It's not like the soldiers carry all the equipment around - we have already seen videos of Russians capturing trucks full of weapons on the Ukranian side.

Many captured vehicles might also be reclaimed by Russia afterwards.

Lots of troop losses but a lot of them are just injuries, morale loses, captures. At the end of the war, perhaps only some 15000 or such only died on the Russian side, which is still a relatively small part of their entire force.

It will cost them a lot to try to keep Ukraine under control, but it's not the first them they institute draconian measures to keep a population in check.

The sanctions sure will hurt Russia, but there seem to be too many ways to work around them. They will take a hit but I don't think they will miss resources.

They will probably not start attacking other nations immediately. It will probably be more like a cold war. Ten years of Russia rearming itself. Especially with modern nuclear weapons. Stronger ties nurtured between Russia and other authoritarian states. Non-stop provocations and conflicts on the side - notably cyber terrorism and state-funded terrorism. Western nations might have no choice but to turn up the defense budgets even further, which means money that won't go into societal and technological development.

It seems like a dark future. I would rather see it snuffed out now.

The nations failed to take such a common stance and as some made it clear that they would not send troops, others followed suit. It seems like Putin was provoking these reactions and judging how the nations would react.

I also think there's a huge difference between marching on Russia and sending troops to defend Ukraine. The latter is not a declaration of war on Russia, despite what Putin says. I am personally in favor of it but I know it's complex and most do not agree.

But as a civilisation we are at an epoch defining moment. Do we stand up for our values or not? Do we support those people who just want to have access the those same rights and freedoms that you and I take for granted, or do we abandon them to the whim of a dictator? Freedom of speech. The freedom to choose how you are governed. The freedom to decide how your country acts towards others and the direction it takes. Freedom of worship. Freedom from fear or want. These are not just pithy statements or concepts but are fundamental to our identity as free peoples of the World. They form the basis of our civilisation. And these rights, while being universal, are under attack. A dictator in Russia wants to force an entire European country to surrender all freedoms and submit to his will or be erased from history. If he succeeds who is next? Finland? Sweden? Georgia? Armenia? Fear prevents us from acting and gives a free pass to the dictators of the world to act with impunity.

He was speaking as to the mindset of Putin.  Why WOULDN'T Putin take advantage of an obviously feeble-minded and weak Biden?

""By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad. Very sad.""

Trump then LITERALLY went on to say that Putin wouldn't have done this if he had still been in office (rightfully so) and that if he HAD, Trump would have ordered strikes against Moscow.

Let's take a look at the timeline:

Obama refuses to send aid and lethal deterrents to Ukraine- Putin ""annexes"" the Crimean penninsula

Trump sends plane loads of Javelins and other weapons to Ukraine WHILE sanctioning Russia- Russia calms their tits

The sundowning racist, Biden is installed, STOPS sending lethal aid to Ukraine, and says, OUT FUCKING LOUD, that no matter what Russia does to Ukraine, the US won't ever send troops to stop them.  Oh yeah, he also gave all our intel to the Chinese, who then turned it directly over to Russia- Russia launches a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.

Grow the fuck up.

And Trump didn't ""Withold aid to Ukraine"".  The Democrats got mad because Trump was withholding aid to an obviously corrupt Poroshenko.  Zelenskyy was elected in large part to clean up the Poroshenko corruption that was enabled by politicians like the Bidens, the Pelosis, the Romnneys.",2bbcf290c7ffd3176af331c6d76c62cfa6cb6e3b,True,False,,,,,0,1646602357,,0,{},hzmi1sn,False,t3_t887ng,False,True,t1_hzme507,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t887ng/ukraine_soldier_says_us_not_honoring_their/hzmi1sn/,1646602374,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646573557.0,,,,

The focus has been on counter insurgency ops in Afghanistan so heavy armour, like tanks and IFVs have been neglected for 20+ years. NATO could mount a defense but not an offensive campaign with ground forces at the moment. But what NATO countries are capable of is projecting airpower because this was used extensively in Afghanistan. The only thing lacking is political will to do so.

On the no fly zone, that point is correct too. It would definitely prevent Ukraine from attacking Russian forces. But I do not suggest a no fly zone. I suggest NATO air forces fight with Ukraine and very quickly end the Russian war crimes by destroying the artillery and aircraft being used to indiscriminately bomb civilians. Attacking air defense is not done by dropping bombs over a wide area but rather with targeted missile strikes. This would not cause casualties to civilians unless Russians use civilians as human shields. Which would be another war crime committed by Russia.

War is appalling. So often the best decision is the one which results in the least casualties over the long term even if in the short term casualties spike higher.

(look no further than all the idiots who believe various conspiracies in the US).  

My biggest concern is that those in charge in Russia will be successful enough at controlling the narratives that when the majority in Russia experience the economic collapse, they can say you are broke and starving and miserable because the US did this to you.  Blame them its their fault and they hate you. 

And because it's human instinct to look for someone or something to blame when there is suffering and things are difficult, it will be easy to believe that it's the fault of the faceless foreign country, rather than the leadership whose names and faces are seen everyday.   That will eventually lead to a resentment and hatred of those they blame which will result in a rekindled cold war.   And that means a whole new generation will grow up with a distrust and hatred toward western cultures and democracy.   Then as that generation takes over, the cycle will continue and the suffering will continue to be blamed outside of the leaders who make the decisions.

The only real hope to avoid that future is to somehow have individuals like you find a way to resist and grow the message that the world doesn't hate Russians.  It hates the Russian leadership and their greed and manipulative practices that are used to retain and grow their power over all those they come across.

And Russia made a lot of them to boot, which is why many are still flying to this day. So Ukrainian pilots, they were trained with Soviet-era planes, so giving them Western aircraft would take much longer for them to train and be ready, which is time they don’t have. Poland received a lot of ex-German MiG-29s on top of their own fleet, and many are mothballed IIRC. They can easily be pulled out of storage, cleaned, and prepared to fight.

Russia isn’t exactly utilizing their very best in terms of air assets right now, so I’d imagine new Ukrainian MiG-29s would be used to attack low-flying attack craft and helicopters as opposed to trying to create air superiority (Russia has a lot of SAMs too, after all). They could also be used to attack wayward aircraft that aren’t protected by Russian anti-air, including supply aircraft and even drones.

Of course, this is just me talking like an armchair general, but for what it’s worth the MiG-29 is a versatile aircraft, and Ukraine would no doubt get the greatest milage out of every single one of them.",8f9cb54e353027d26c638a694d1cb16e9b43b718,True,False,,,,,0,1646598456,,0,{},hzm8uzu,False,t3_t80wh4,False,True,t3_t80wh4,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t80wh4/us_and_poland_are_in_discussion_to_give_sovietera/hzm8uzu/,1646598473,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646569656.0,,,,

First, without drawing a line in the sand Putin continues to make it clear to the whole world that if you have nukes then you can do what you want, even in Europe, and NATO will not stop you. The message to Iran and others is loud and clear - build nukes and act with impunity. This creates a much bigger problem down the road. 

Second and more immediate, is Russian war crimes. Civilians are dying right now. They are being deliberately target by Russian forces. Attacking a nuclear power plant is also a war crime. If we intervene now we save life and head off a much greater catastrophe. This is also a very easy and verifiable narrative to explain to neutrals which will no doubt be backed up by rulings from the ICJ and ICC.

To be honest I don't even think it will take the whole of NATO to achieve this. US and UK both have treaty obligations guaranteeing rhe independence of Ukraine following Ukraines giving up nukes. Based on the performance of the Russian airforce I think air supremacy would be achieved very quickly and the threat of bombing Russian ground forces with impunity will likely break Russian army morale completely.",990fd492f4f15c5e54b862b5e3708309a8b44c89,True,False,,,,,0,1646594912,,0,{},hzm0iod,True,t3_t7m8pq,False,True,t1_hzldeen,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t7m8pq/military_aid_is_working_ua_troops_destroying/hzm0iod/,1646594925,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646566112.0,,,,

And this was most likely true, as for example finnish authorities reported that approx 40K soldiers were called off from finnish border and moved (where else than Ukraine).  


Belarus were about joining the fight with their army (or Lukashenko was), but seemed their army disobeyed the command and they couldnt send it in the end. This is helpful, but Belarus still is part of the attackers as russians are using their soil to attack to Ukraine. Hopefully they can get rid off Lukashenko soon as he will get the army to fight (he is nothing but tragic puppet to Putin). That would break Belarus free from Putin.  


Estimates report these losses for Russia already being  more than 3 billions and more to come day-by-day. Along with sanctions, Russias economy is going for middle-ages. West hasnt truly hit their last resort though, which is energy (gas and oil). That nail in the coffin is needed yesterday.  


Huge losses, but unfortunately Putin seems to prepare his army going all the way. Perhaps he knows he is down for sure if he cant come from this as a victor or just misguided fucker, dont care about that guy that much what he thinks.   


Sad fact is that if Russia brings in its reserves, Russia can operate army of ten-times than this, but how much of their (estimated 3 millions) personnel can actually really leave their posts for Ukraine, is another thing. Russia is huge and now they have to worry for shutting down protestors not spreading the truth out more. Without army, policemen would be without protection for example.  


West countries are afraid of end of the world from nuclear if they attack directly to Putin.

Turkey closed the Bosphorus to the Russian navy. They said they would enforce their decision, and Russian warships which had intentions of going to the Black Sea decided not to test Turkey’s resolve (who, recall, shot down a Russian jet in 2015 for violating their air space.) It is the maritime equivalent of a no-fly zone. Of course the caveat was its closed to *all* warships, but literally no one intended to go in the Black Sea but the Russian navy.

Additionally, Russia has shied away from far western Ukraine, deliberately avoiding conflict on the borders of a NATO country.

Further, it would seem a deal is actually in the works to supply Ukraine with Polish MiG-29s, on the condition that those are replaced by US F-16s. If this is the case, why stop at fighters? Why not send artillery and IFVs? Stingers and javelins were delivered strictly within the framework of “defensive equipment”- providing jets is a massive shift and is effectively deploying NATO assets.

To be clear, I’m not advocating a no-fly zone, but the hypothesis that Russia is itching for an excuse to start WWIII when threatened by NATO is not grounded in reality either. Statements from Russian public officials going back to last year have consisted of sometimes thinly veiled threats and brinksmanship, but their actions tell an entirely different story. They have avoided NATO like the plague, and it’s not entirely clear to me how supplying a stream of equipment up to fighter jets is much different than a war by proxy for NATO, which Russia has publicly acknowledged as well.",b584a3178807b49448b8560c5de091d3478d7d82,True,False,,,,,0,1646585553,,0,{},hzldj0q,False,t3_t7ybt6,False,True,t1_hzkovcl,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t7ybt6/close_the_sky/hzldj0q/,1646585566,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646556753.0,,,,

NATO directly attacking Russian troops seems like an unnecessary risk. There's all the usual reasons but a big reason, directly related to what you wrote, is Russian morale. 

It seems that any NATO country entering the war would suddenly unite Russia and boost morale. ""Putin was right!"" they'll say, ""NATO is a direct threat to Russia!"" 

Their propoganda machine is working overtime to hide their obvious lies but this would give such an easy victory to their state media, and for what? A chance to end the war 2 weeks earlier? 

Any betting man would say that at the current pace Ukraine will win, I definitely think so and it looks like you do as well. So why make a move that has the potential to change the fundamental nature of this war and give Russia a rallying cry to unite their country? This would also change the positions of other neutral countries. China comes to mind who right now is remaining neutral but an attack from NATO would likely push them to Russia's side. 

I know this means we're basically asking Ukraine to bear the human cost, and I'm very aware I'm sitting safely across the ocean away from the fight. But strategically it's the right thing to do. NATO is already helping in every conceivable way short of sending troops, and it's working. There's no need to escalate this.

I think your analysis that Ukraine should go on the offensive to take back their land is absolutely right on. Russia is dazed and confused right now.

When all of this started happening, she sends me this guys youtube account to follow to get ""the other side"" and gave me a recounting (obviously one-sided) of the recent history.   
She even sent me the invite link to one of the pro-Putin/Russia propaganda telegram groups.   


I'm a fairly sceptical person, so I didn't believe anything she said at face value.

However, I'm left wondering if there is or were any shreds of truth to it.

She, at first, was excited for Russia to invade. She said that she thought Russia would secure the Donbas region and that the people would have the liberation that she said that all of them wanted, and there would be peace between them and Ukraine.   
Since it instantly escalated, she hasn't been online much(That's how I stay in touch with her these days), and I daresay she might be doing some serious soul-searching...   


But, well... Yeah. I wonder how much, if any, truth there is in the dubious recent past between the Donbas region and the rest of Ukraine.   


I wonder if the separatist line is as honest and simple as she made it sound, in that those local governments simply didn't accept the new Ukrainian government.   
Or, if they had Russian infiltration in their local governments to stoke that, and through propaganda proliferate that attitude. 

Again, I'm absolutely pro-Ukraine. I just pose these as muddled thoughts that at this point I don't have a clear or definitive point of view on of my own.

There are, however, some other possibilities as far as assistance that, while quite risky, might allow the West to straddle the line between actively engaging Russia and sticking to sanctions and supplies. One would be Berlin Airlift style assistance where cargo planes drop relief supplies to besieged cities. The hope would be that Russia would be sufficiently circumspect about actually getting NATO involved in a shooting war that they would hesitate to down these planes and provoke a response. Another would be for NATO forces to come in to eastern Ukraine at the behest of the Ukrainian government as a bulwark against Russia taking the whole country. Basically just come in and squat there in solidly Ukrainian held territory and dare the Russians to shoot first. If this allowed Ukraine to hold even a rump state, it would greatly facilitate later supplying insurgents in any areas Russia takes.

In both cases, I wouldn't trust Putin to hold off, but not everyone can be as crazy as he seems and the Russian military commanders have to be aware of just how poorly they'd fare against NATO when it comes to anything other than nukes and that nukes are a death sentence. The hope would be that they would resist pressure from Putin, further weakening his position.

I do feel like we have to do something and (my apologies to Ukraine and know that this is not a personal opinion but a geopolitical assessment only) not so much because we have to help Ukraine specifically but because if we let Putin hold a nuclear gun to our heads without some response other than sanctions, and he manages to survive those sanctions, we have essentially given him carte blanche to take whatever territory he desires and are reduced to hoping that Ukraine bogs him down enough long term that he can't attack anywhere else because once he knows that we will avoid any and all actions that might eventually result in nukes, we are rendered toothless.",aeca542c024b4b37dca74a479152a80839d76f3a,True,False,,,,,0,1646580129,,0,{},hzl0sbr,False,t3_t7ybt6,False,True,t3_t7ybt6,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t7ybt6/close_the_sky/hzl0sbr/,1646580142,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646551329.0,,,,

Unfortunately this has to be contained and all avenues have to be looked at first sanctions will work long term but won't stop this war.  


What we are all witnessing is horrific and barbaric for this day and age the wars over the past 100 years continue to dived us more and more. World war 3 will happen sometime soon how soon no ones knows but this will be the last war on earth. 

Russia 

The only options for peace is Putin needs to go only people who can do that is the Russian people the videos I've seen are no different to SS on German citizens mainly Jewish and gypsies, The propaganda gone straight back to the USSR days and the new laws around calling this a war is just a look at how hard Putin government are pushing this agenda. 

Nato

We need to stick to promise we made unless provked, we said that we would not admit country's to the east of Europe but we did right or wrong it was that sovereign country choice. 


The world can't go on with personal agenda by leaders the only agenda should be how to move forward as humans in science, medical and health issues, development of 3rd world country, space travel. 



The future of humanity at this moment is down to soldiers/armed forces willing to die for an agenda if they all refused no war no deaths only the elite left to argue with themselves.

You are doing a bloody good, commendable job of it too, and the rest of the world is mighty impressed. Western leaders know there are wider, future implications which they are preparing for just in case (e.g. Germany). But let's be honest here, if Nato or other nations get involved directly the stakes are raised to a level that would threaten every soul on this planet. Compare that to how many are directly involved now. Of course if Russia escalated it by moving further West then they'd have much more powerful military to contend with, far more than they are capable of dealing with if the last fortnight is anything to go by. 
I think we would all like to see this ended, none more so than you but it's similar to a 1v1 fight versus a riot. I think we're hoping the 1v1 is where it will all end and we are betting on you guys for the win. 
What we don't need to do is provoke a mad man into making the whole world burn because we had a hurried strategy. 
I think you know that's true. 
It's an ethical dilemma, it doesn't sit entirely well but it is morally sound when you compare the numbers involved now versus the numbers that would be involved (exponentially).
We cannot be accused of sitting back and letting Russia win when you take all of the current collective support is taken into account. 
It breaks my heart it's happening....I hope with every fibre of my being that it doesn't escalate any further. Can you imagine seeing the effects of a nuke on Ukraine? And Putin blaming the West for him having to do it? Destroying and obliterating all life and evidence if his war crimes....


Hold on in there. We are all behind you but it's your fight for now (with as much support as is strategically sensible).

The more logical answer is that the trucks sat and sat and the tires are probably dry and rotten on one side from sitting and also just from how old they are. 

I'm not tires expert but there are a few things about tires I know from just using them on my daily and on my track car. 

First tires get heat cycled out, which doesn't apply to military trucks since they probably won't ever head them up that high, but also age of the tire. 
   Even if my track car's tires still have loads of tread I will usually replace them to due heat cycles, and if, for example, my second set of wheels' tires have sat for too long, they will be no good at some point even if they are just sitting in my garage. 

So just like I don't want a failure on track when I need them to perform, a military needs to maintain and replace their tires so they perform when needed based on what they are designed for. 

Allllll that said.... I'm so happy the Russians were too corrupt to be able to maintain their equipment properly.

&gt; Art. 18. Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.

&gt; States which are Parties to a conflict shall provide all civilian hospitals with certificates showing that they are civilian hospitals and that the buildings which they occupy are not used for any purpose which would deprive these hospitals of protection in accordance with Article 19.

&gt; Civilian hospitals shall be marked by means of the emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of 12 August 1949, but only if so authorized by the State.

&gt; The Parties to the conflict shall, in so far as military considerations permit, take the necessary steps to make the distinctive emblems indicating civilian hospitals clearly visible to the enemy land, air and naval forces in order to obviate the possibility of any hostile action.

&gt; In view of the dangers to which hospitals may be exposed by being close to military objectives, it is recommended that such hospitals be situated as far as possible from such objectives.

&gt; Art. 19. The protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.

&gt; The fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are nursed in these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet been handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.

It was sort of along the same questionability of every Russian POW saying the same thing in the Ukrainian videos. I've also seen a few other such videos shared on Twitter.

I think Ukraine's reason for showing those video is to make sure the world knows they aren't summarilly executing enemy soldiers and they're receiving medical attention and being fed as a way to prevent Russia from making claims they're being tortured. At the same time it's making the soldiers look like they were misled by their government and relaying that information back to their families which is honestly a form of a propaganda in itself.

Clearly you can tell by the reactions of some of the family they call in the videos being terrified for their safety as a captured prisoner implies the Russian media is trying to make it seem like the Ukrainians are treating people barbaricly.

Most of the world doesn't want to push the Russian perspective so it doesn't behoove them to share interogations of the captured Ukrainian soldiers.

Because there are tons of parallels:

Working for government in some fashion as it collapses during a war and is worse for wear: ✅

Angry about said defeat and viewing it as a catastrophe: ✅

Going into politics and consolidating power around themselves in a borderline dictatorship vowing to bring back the country’s greatness: ✅

Spending the next few years sowing division into potential international enemies: ✅

Slowly taking pieces of his neighbors through warfare little by little as the international community placates him: ✅ 

Gets brave enough from what he’s been allowed to do to the point where he invades a neighbor outright, this is the step too far that draws international outrage and more real responses: ✅

Quite literally like he’s taking Hitler’s playbook play by play to be honest. Only thing he’s missing on is he doesn’t subscribe the eugenics and isn’t actively committing genocide(beyond a few anti gay sentiments). Outside of that it’s a little terrifying how closely putin is mirroring Hitler.

I think my primary concern is the level of desperation we've yet to see here. Russia is now facing a potentially failed invasion, global exposure of dramatically overestimated conventional forces, an incalculably high potential reparations bill following the decimation of their economy, and accountability for atrocious and numerous war crimes. When you leave someone with nothing to lose, they become far more dangerous, and it appears that Putin faces a very real existential threat following the position he has put himself in. Now to the credit of your argument, I will also bring up the Russian nuclear detection systems' false alarm in 1983 that nearly caused a ""retaliatory"" strike against the U.S. and NATO. It was a soviet officer, who's name I unfortunately can't remember off the top, who prevented the escalation. It is a possibility that somewhere along the chain of command, an order for launching the first nuclear strikes would be outright refused.

Alternatively there is another less risky move, which would be to continue to support Ukraine from the sidelines with an information campaign in hopes they are able to hold them off and cause enough damage to allow doubt within the Russian ranks and citizens.

NATO is nuclear too. Fighting a proxy war in Ukraine provides each side with a convienient stopping point. As long as NATO does not attack Russia directly or invade its territory then there is no reason to use nukes becase of Mutually Assured Destruction. 

Also, I would reference the Cuban Missile Crisis where Khrushchev also backed down when he fully understood that the US and NATO were not bluffing and were willing to go to war over nukes in Cuba. So long as Putin is able to scare the West with nuked he has free regin to do what he wants.",9408b9995f64d10661d3f104f38eb32e2552c102,True,False,,,,,0,1646530825,,0,{},hziuwlb,True,t3_t7m8pq,False,True,t1_hzit3ak,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t7m8pq/military_aid_is_working_ua_troops_destroying/hziuwlb/,1646530837,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646502025.0,,,,
