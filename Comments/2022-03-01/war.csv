[https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/theduran](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/theduran)

They are ""conservative leaning"" by the US standard I guess (they are sympathetic to Trump).

From a left wing US sources you can try this author: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Ames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ames), but I have no idea for whom he writes now. He used to run great newspaper in Moscow for expats (called Exile), he was kicked out by Russian government when he made acquittances with some radical opposition politicians. He know great deal about ex-Soviet union countries.

[https://thegrayzone.com/](https://thegrayzone.com/) is another good leftist US source, you can find lot of info about Ukrainian far right scene there.

If you want something more analytical, try these guys: [https://www.youtube.com/user/cftni/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/cftni/videos)

They are ex-CIA and ex-US government. They are pretty knowledgeable as far as I can tell, and they don't talk propaganda BS like other Washington ""think tanks"".

You can google [Michael Kofman](https://www.cna.org/experts/Kofman_M) for military stuff, he works on Russia (for US navy I believe). Look for videos with him on youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=michael+kofman](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=michael+kofman)

I just found this guy, he blogs from Ukraine right now, you may find him interesting: [https://www.youtube.com/c/CoachRedPill/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoachRedPill/videos)

Look also at this guy: [John Mearsheimer](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=john+mearsheimer) if you want to understand geopolitical picture from ""realist"" school of thought. Putin is realist so this will help you understand his motivations.

And what about the Eastern European countries that fear Russia, its military and the leaders the Russians elect for life? The reason why joining NATO has become popular idea in Finland is due to Russian aggression, not because NATO is cool or anything (I think they're just American c\*cksuckers and shills). Its because Ukraine was mutilated, the treaties that guaranteed their security with the Russians ripped to shreds, its people torn apart by the Russians. Why would any country ever want anything to do with Russia after what they did to Ukraine. Russians conducted false flag ops. in Eastern Ukraine just like the Soviets did in Poland, and just like the Nazis did in Poland prior to war, and all of them refusing to find a peaceful settlement on the matter. No other European country wants to face Russia alone like Ukraine did or even like Georgia did.

Entire story is nitpicking, manipulation and propaganda. Video under this link is a false claim followed by fragment of video taken out of context:

1. Text description under the video claims *""In 2016 Viktor Shokin (prosecutor general of Ukraine) \[...\] identified Hunter Biden as the recipient of over $3,000,000 from the company"";*
2. However, the direct demand to fire Viktor Shokin made by Joe Biden had happened in December 2015 (i.e. before 2016).
3. Moreover, Viktor Shokin was preventing proper investigation against the Burisma and its corrupted owner - Mykola Zlochevsky.

The reason why US wanted Viktor Shokin to be fired is because he was highly-corrupted. Anti-corruption reforms was a condition for getting loan from US, and him not being fired was the deal breaker. Entire case with false accusations towards Hunter Biden was intended to be used as an information weapon against Joe Biden as a politician. Wiki has a detailed [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal#Ukraine_and_the_Bidens) about this:

&gt;*As of May 16, 2019, when the prosecutor general's office cleared Biden and his son of alleged corruption, there is no evidence that Biden acted to protect his son's involvement with Burisma, although Trump, Giuliani, and their allies have fueled speculation.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You have it completely wrong. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vdiEABLFoo&amp;t=930s

Video under the link is a laughable propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Neo-Nazis have significant influence in the current Ukrainian government \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;For example Ukrainian army have neo-Nazi unit as part of it's official military. It's called Azov battalion \[...\]

False claim and propaganda. Claims that ""Azov are nazi"" are based on deeply-echeloned propaganda. ""Anti-fascists"" mentioned a lot in the referred article are not an actual anti-fascists - they are mostly russian agenda who are using left rhetorics as an informational weapon, as part of the russian informational war against Ukraine. An actual war against Ukraine (which started by russia 6 days ago) was justified, among other lie, by made up ""anti-nazi"" rhetorics as well. This is what it is all about - justification of a war, invasion, and ongoing multiple war crimes and terrorist attacks against Ukrainians.

Russian army gave strict orders to their soldiers not to film and publish anything (they probably had to gave up cellphones too). And they also made it a policy not to publish any official videos. Now since Chechens have special ""privileges"", they were allowed to film. Which is why you got so many videos from them as soon as they arrived.

The logic behind is that Russian army is liberating Ukraine from regime of neo-Nazis and American puppets and Russian soldiers don't fight against Ukrainian people. Any looses that Russian impose on Ukrainian army are ""necessary evil"" and not something to brag about.

It looks like Russian government is now changing policy, may be they see that they are loosing the propaganda war, not sure, and some official videos are been published.

In short, impression made by the footage you see is skewed because how imbalanced it is. And yes, you can get much better feeling how things are doing from maps.

Do you suppose the Ukrainians aren’t happy to kill. Their enemy? What about the Russian? What about when the Americans killed terrorists? What about when they killed Americans? That’s the point. I’m demonstrating exactly what conflict brings. Vain indifference to human life. Russians in these threads see the videos of bombings of civilian buildings but below it defend their countries decision. It hurts when that vain indifference is turned around. there are those who may not give two fucks about dead Ukrainians, but they do about their dead countrymen. It bothers them and they don’t like seeing what this war is bringing.

So, I’m not looking for you to agree. I could care less. I’m forcing perspective on people who like to learn about war with a post on the internet but don’t like seeing it’s reality. War is hell right? Then shouldn’t you not like to see it? Shouldn’t you feel the same about the photos of dead soldiers and civilians posted here for every other war?

I recently started seeing a lot of videos about People being shot in absolute nowhere in a car. Why would russians do that? They dont shoot the civillians. At least i think they dont because I saw a lot of fist fights of People fighting russian soldiers, or People jumping on russian cars, standing in front of tanks etc. And none of them shot the civillians. It makes me believe that the militants, Who were given guns to defend the country, shoot these People because they are fleeing...

Look once again, it's now 05:15 over here and I will go to bed after this one, but my opinion of what's gone on has changed drastically upon viewing all the footage this last week. I don't like it. I was pro Russia prior to the invasion not thinking it would go this way. And I was that way because of the atrocities committed by Ukraine against Russia. I am not in any way in support of the current government or the invasion now. I find it abhorrent and detestable.

But what I do want to see is an investigation into what has been going on. There is just an insurmountable quantity of evidence damning the Ukrainian force's actions and I find that just as disgusting.

My reason for posting is that I find it ridiculous the absolute denial from all western parties, of the actions taken on the part of Ukraine. Every country keeps reiterating in the UN that the the invasion was ""unprovoked"" and I think that it was provoked very strongly.

When I sleep I will dream of a peaceful and allied Europe (including Ukraine) and Russia where the European part of Russia is no longer just geographically European.

&gt;Factor 1. What has biden to do with Ukraine, I noticed some years ago of some sort of a scandel or something fishy biden was doing in Ukraine, someone even said about a virus labortary that was operated or financed by biden in ukraine..but I have no sources to prove it.

There is this very corrupt men in Ukraine that owns company called [Burisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burisma). In 2014 people who this men had business conflicts with came to power in Kiev. To get a protection, this corrupt businessman hired bunch Western politicians and their relatives as a ""cover"" against judicial attacks and prosecution of his business by his opponents that were now in power in Kiev. Among people this corrupt businessman hired was son of Joe Biden, Hunter Biden. Also former Polish minister and bunch of other high ranking politicians from EU. Formally they were sitting on the board of this corrupt company receiving huge sums of money for doing nothing.

It worked. [Joe Biden forced Ukrainian president Poroshenko to fire Ukrainian general procurer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXA--dj2-CY) who was investigating this corrupt businessman and his company Burisma under the threat of not giving to Ukraine US government loan until procurer is fired. President Porošhenko at first did not want to do it, because general procurer was his political ally, but then he threw him under the bus. Ukraine desperately needed  money from USA.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Factor 2. In normal wars, the operation is always organized, but this is the most unorganized war I've ever seen, the Russian troops running out of fuels, abandoning position (my theory the Z team are the point of no return, and they are all mostly young russian kids, meaning Putin send young men to their death for no reasons, but maybe for some reasons he doesn't want to have many young generation in russia that are maybe a threat to the future of communism as they are more likely to follow the path of freedom)

You have it completely wrong. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vdiEABLFoo&amp;t=930s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vdiEABLFoo&amp;t=930s)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Factor 3. Putin keeps calling them nazis, etc, and it is not an invasion, so this whole thing is like a reverse psychology war.. just does not make any sense at all.

Neo-Nazis have significant influence in the current Ukrainian government because they have ties to various Ukrainian oligarchs and politicians. For example Ukrainian army have neo-Nazi unit as part of it's official military. It's called [Azov battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion) and is part of Ukrainian national Guard because former minister of internal affairs was patron of this neo-Nazi group:

*Indeed, 2005-2010 was a fruitful time for Patriot of Ukraine, the Kharkiv neo-Nazi group whose members later came to form Azov. With Avakov as governor, this neo-Nazi group cooperated with the Kharkiv authorities and police. Their activities included monitoring “illegal immigrants” in the city’s student hostels and raiding shopping kiosks (whose owners were, by coincidence, not loyal to the local authorities’ material interests).*  
  
*In February 2014, Avakov became interior minister*

[https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/rise-of-azov/](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/rise-of-azov/)

&amp;#x200B;

Avakov was not the only high ranking Ukrainian politician that have ties to neo-Nazis, many other politicians and oligarchs have too. Mayor of Kiev Klitcho made another neo-Nazi organization [called C14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S14_(Ukrainian_group)) in to a city police:

*Anton Kolumbet was appointed the press-person of the “Municipalnaya Varta”, the vigilante formation assisted by then mayor of Kiev Vitaly Klichko. According to Ukrainian media, “Municipalnaya Varta” is mostly made of members of far-right group S14 led by Yevhen Karas’.*

So this *anonymous* looks to be part of their a random propaganda campaign. You can tell by the story they've come up with about the desire to re-establish the Soviet Union. Another random skid also published a fake article on the compromised news website tass, which purported to be a prepared ""post-Ukrainian annexation report"" and detailed how this was Putin's goal to reunite old Russian allies. The conspiracy is identical.

The steps appear to be:

* make western civilians believe Russia wants to restore the Soviet Union and Ukraine is the current target with fake news articles and rhetoric simply reciting this conspiracy
* discredit and deny the countless videos and photos that evidence the Ukrainian atrocities against ethnic Russians; man, women, and children as the lies of a tyrant/dictator
* sew doubt when damning videos arise with questions like ""are they saboteurs?"" ""I heard the Russians were donning the Ukrainian's clothing"" etc
* use provocative language in doing this because it stirs emotion in the manipulable
* at the end of the war given the west wins it, absorb Ukraine into the western hemisphere (EU or NATO membership or both) while --
* unrest is sewn in Russia until Russia can also become the final western puppet
* once all is said and done, the economic codependence of Russia on the west will ensure money is made by the big boys of the western hemisphere and Russia will finally actually be subordinated

One needs to look past all this western propaganda and ask themselves:

* Do you honestly believe the videos of the tiny Russian kids from Eastern Ukraine uploaded over 7 years ago missing limbs with bloody stumps, and dying in hospital beds are fake?
* Do you honestly believe they've been faking it for 8 continuous years?
* Do you honestly think all those children and mothers crying and recounting the shellings are paid actors or something?
* Do you honestly believe the number of Russian dead (surpassing fourteen thousand prior to February 2022) which is agreed upon by all sides in the war (Ukraine, Russia, UN, DPR, and LPR) are made up?
* Do you honestly believe the random chance videos shot in Donbass depicting billboards stating that *Russians don't exist* were just placed there to be in the background of random YouTuber's videos?
* Do you honestly believe there was no ethnic cleansing going on?
* Do you honestly believe the fascist groups like Azov Battalion were able to overthrow authorities in Kiev such that they could parade there unchecked (perhaps a red herring, but why are there so many photos of them in Independence square and other major centres)?
* Do you honestly believe that the eight members of the old diplomatic party replaced by Zelenskyy all committed suicide after the armed coup?
* Do you honestly believe the deaths of the President of the DPR and attempted assassination on the LPR diplomatic party were fake?
* Do you honestly believe that people who want to escape ethnic persecution do not deserve autonomy and a right to vote to do so with or without the support of their home-nation?
* Do you honestly believe Russia had no right to step in after all this violence began and not do anything to help their people (in 2014)?
* Do you honestly believe anyone in the UN/NATO/EU actually listened to Russia's concerns?
* Do you honestly believe Russia remaining unheard for this 8 or 9 year period should have continued to wait while five Russians were killed on average per day, and they continued to have to receive refugees?
* Do you honestly believe Russia wants this escalated war?
* Do you honestly believe anyone wants this war in *any* of its parts?

And do you honestly believe that when you say ""Slava Ukraina"" that you are supporting the sovereignty of a country and its people, and not the bloodshed their forces perpetrated for the better part of the past decade targeting *predominantly civilians*?

I feel you all need to start considering the information and input streams for yourselves and stop absorbing these anti-Russian provocative titles and propaganda videos. Look at *all* of the news sources, see how the numbers change as you change sides. Look at how the entire western hemisphere is banding to create a ridiculous Rusophobia so strong it rivals the hatred of the Jewish people last century - and how this phobia is warping your beliefs and capacity to call into question, or consider. Look at how Russia and previously the RSFSR has been the target of NATO explicitly (its in its founding articles) and how every diplomat and politician that interacts with Russia denies everything they ask for or state. Look at how the Ukrainian refugees are on all western news stations for the last few days, non-stop. How all these tragic stories are being shared, but none of the Russian side from the last eight years were ever shown and how their mention is met with ""paid Putin bot"" criticism and ridicule, admonishment, and rebuffal. The same refugee situation, far more deaths, far more child victims. And when the world heard Russia speak and watched the videos it just retorted ""it's made up"", ""it's lies"", ""it's a false pretext"" time and time again.

Lastly I would like to encourage you not to admonish someone for being Russian or Ukrainian. Just because they are of a nationality does not discredit what they have to say. To not believe what someone has to say because they share a nationality or ethnicity is basic racism and/or xenophobia.",13165689268e1a35b143836cb08fbe95216c7852,True,False,,,,,0,1646144031,,0,{},hywvwds,False,t3_t3sllr,False,True,t3_t3sllr,/r/war/comments/t3sllr/anonymous_sent_a_message_to_putin/hywvwds/,1646144046,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646115231.0,,,,

Hate is tearing me apart! Hatred for everyone. For every creature that is involved in this hell.  
Year 2014. Russia annexes Crimea. Heck! I was against it from the very beginning. Despite all patriotism around. I knew from relatives and friends in the Crimea that the majority there really wanted it. I was against the tension between us. 

  
Together with Crimea, problems begin in Donetsk and Lugansk. I don’t know what really happened there, but I know that a woman at work (a refugee from the Donetsk region) spoke about Ukraine only with pain and hatred. She only mentioned a few times about the bombings by the Ukrainian army. An army that bombed civilians.

  
I am 100% sure that the birth of the DPR and LPR was not without the hand of the Kremlin. But such sentiments (as well as color revolutions) are not born out of the blue. Without the support of the people this is not possible ...

  
The authorities in Russia did not want to lose influence on Ukraine. The Russian authorities feared NATO.

  
“the West”… Excuse me, but I will personify with this word those who were interested in this. Yes, I'm wrong. I know it. I know that the average American, as well as the German, the French, the Italian... (Damn, I won't list) ...it's nothing. I hope you forgive this exaggeration. Let there be West. The West also needs influence. Ordinary fuss in an ordinary sandbox. That's just the sandbox is our whole world.

  
Now we have what we have. What was in Lugansk and Donetsk for 7 years is now all over Ukraine. Please God let this all end soon. God forbid that this does not unfold all over the world. It pains me to see what is going on there.

  
Looking around (in Russia) I see two groups.   
The first group looks at the war with horror. The fact that we ourselves (!!!) went to war against our brothers. It just doesn't fit in every Russian's head. We used to think that Russians/Ukrainians/Belarusians are the first to NEVER (!!!) ATTACK. Heck!   
The second group, triumphantly, says that at the end of this 7 years HELL will end. Women and children will no longer die. Both are right in some ways and wrong in some ways. Both of them have friends and relatives in Ukraine. It's horrible.  
This shit is 7 years old. I don't hate every. Russian/Ukrainian/American/European who is involved in this. Let's finally finish this. I don't want to hate.

WARNING! This video is a powerful ""psychological weapon"".  To create the desired feeling in the heart.   
The video shows one side. I apply it only because on this resource there is a bias in one of the sides. See why there are many (how many are against) people in Russia for this war.

PS: Whatever the reason. People will suffer. It is impossible to wage war (no matter how good goals are set) and not hurt the civilian population. With pain from Russia. No war. Putin go away!

Q: Why not use aircraft?
A: Russian Air Force by this point has achieved total air superiority meaning what left will have to go through a formidable air defense network including how many combat aircraft are defending it 

Q: What about all the new planes they are getting?
A: These planes are used by NATO countries meaning their avionics and systems will be very different from what UKAF pilots are used to, meaning time to learn how to use them and employ weapons that aren’t synced to the ones used by the UKAF. (Many NATO aircraft are designed to carry the same weapons to streamline logistics and production of ammunition to allies). I’m not certain but most if not all countries have a very bad problem with combat pilot retention, meaning it’s likely the UKAF doesn’t have enough pilots to quickly man and employ these new planes. Likely they’d be obliterated by highly trained Russian combat pilots. 

Q: Why not use Artillery?
A: With modern warfare and lack of air superiority any build up of rocket or normal artillery will likely be spotted and destroyed before being able to fire on the convoy.",917cc26e0b2c759f6f77d8e2fe67cee49555ab97,True,False,,,,,0,1646135478,,0,{},hywgq5q,False,t3_t41ae4,False,False,t3_t41ae4,/r/war/comments/t41ae4/why_cant_they_bomb_the_17_mile_convoy/hywgq5q/,1646135490,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646106678.0,,,,

And in my 20 years experience with firearms, both in the military and as a civilian, I've seen plenty of people accidentally shoot themselves, each other, or the wall. Many, were trained military and police officers. But most had no formal training at all and were overconfident and complacent.

I've taught hundreds of people how to shoot as a firearms instructor. Young and old. So if familiar with the common mistakes people make. To some, guns come naturally. But to most, holding one, and using it to hit to kill, let alone hit a target at any significant distances, is a completely foreign concept.

Seriously every time the west underestimated some eastern “subhuman” they got wiped. The success of imperialism came from working within existing power structures and not underestimating anyone, even random African tribes with spears had orientalists studying them, finding ethnic and other divisions, picking winners and losers, and exploiting differences, because it was more sustainable and less costly than forming an army to go invade. Force was used strategically. 

That’s also one reason why divisive politics is still practiced by all nations that want to weaken another. It works. And works well. But this shit doesn’t.

Secondary targets like big cities will still get hit, but not nearly as bad if the U.S. launched first.

If the U.S. launched nukes first, the Russian secondary strike would be absolutely disasterous for NATO population centers. The Russians will not have to take out the 450 U.S. ICBM silos.

Russians also likely have 2 warheads targeting each silo, one land based ICBM and one submarine based SLBM, if there is a failure or the launch system gets destroyed prior to launch the other warhead will kill the silo possibly before it launches.

Russian static ICBM silos were designed to cold launch the missile out of the tube, this allows the silo to be reloaded and fired again. This forces the U.S. to nuke empty silos to prevent them from firing again. 

The U.S. secondary strike is still going to kill a majority of the Russian populations.

These countries don’t want to be part of the Soviet Union, so they align with the US who is against communist expansionism.

* Russia *cannot* back out of this war without some consolation prize. Even setting aside Putin's hubris, It would destroy Putin's legitimacy (which he has based on his strength) and international image.
* Ukraine *cannot* give Russia anything Russia didn't already have at the start of the war (e.g. Donbass), otherwise RU will invade again in a couple years and do this all over again except competently this time.
* Therefore, neither will find an acceptable peace deal
* Russia cannot maintain the current military situation, due to rapidly mounting protests at home. Russia *needs* a reasonably fast victory.
* It is quickly becoming evident that said victory will not be achieved with conventional forces.

From here is conjecture about future events

1. Russia uses a small tactical nuclear strike to force a capitulation from Ukraine. I'm talking a single large demonstration bomb on a city, possibly simultaneous with 10 or so small bombs on military targets to clear the way for Russian forces. Putin believes he can get away with this because what will NATO do? Initiate a nuclear holocaust?
2. Target city will likely be Lviv, due to being a large city with no proximate RU forces, being of comparatively small economic importance to an occupied Ukraine, and being the major funnel route of NATO supplies into the region. NATO member states have personnel in-city, and fallout will fall across Poland and other states. This is EXTREMELY likely to be considered as an Article 5 trigger considering the current world situation. Cue WWIII.
3. Due to it being a *single* event, NATO refuses reply with nukes. Instead, NATO either A) continues with economic and diplomatic retaliation (to little effect), emboldening Russia to continue use of nuclear weapons, or B) NATO sends a special forces decapitation strike on the Russian Government. Russia, if it doesn't immediately collapse, considers this an act of war by NATO member states. Cue WWIII.
4. If NATO took option A (econ/diplo retaliation), then on Russia's 2nd use of nuclear weapons, NATO is forced to launch nuclear weapons on Russia.

I'm absolutely messed up and carrying a lot of mental and emotional scars from it, and some minor physical things that are slowly making themselves known more and more as I age.

When the occupation of Iraq ended, and ISIL swept through Tikrit and Mosul?  I watched the news with absolute horror.  There was a few locals in those two cities, which I spent a lot of time in, that I had gotten to know and actually cared for.  I started drinking again, and hard, as the worry about them tore me apart.

There was one gentleman that I always brought peanut M&amp;Ms to whenever I was by his compound.  His daughters loved them, and it was one of those things that helped me smile in the middle of all that awfulness. I couldn't do much, I was just a lowly NCO in a fucked up situation, trying to show some compassion when his youngest was watching me munch on them one day, so I offered her the rest of the bag.  Her father thanked me, and I promised that if I could?  I would bring more for his family whenever I could.

I managed to once every other week, and it was a small bit of brightness in an otherwise horrible situation.  I still don't know what happened to them, and it pains me to think about it even now.  Someday before my time is up, I hope to go back and find that family.  I know exactly what streets to take, because I walked them so often.  It's my deepest hope to knock on that gate, a backpack loaded with M&amp;Ms, and to see them alive and well and living a decent life.

Ukraine applied to begin a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008.[2][3] Plans for NATO membership were shelved by Ukraine following the 2010 presidential election in which Viktor Yanukovych, who preferred to keep the country non-aligned, was elected President.[4][5] Amid the Euromaidan unrest, Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February 2014.[6] The interim Yatseniuk Government which came to power initially said, with reference to the country's non-aligned status, that it had no plans to join NATO.[7] However, following the Russian military invasion in Ukraine and parliamentary elections in October 2014, the new government made joining NATO a priority.[8] On 21 February 2019, the Constitution of Ukraine was amended, the norms on the strategic course of Ukraine for membership in the European Union and NATO are enshrined in the preamble of the Basic Law, three articles and transitional provisions.[9][10]",916d7e9529c3ac3f7f3b7b281c8452a227384b1d,True,False,,,,,0,1646093725,,0,{},hyujwx6,False,t3_t3h2di,False,True,t1_hyujih2,/r/war/comments/t3h2di/why_putin_didnt_purposefully_send_its_weakest/hyujwx6/,1646093743,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646064925.0,,,,

This is not a war for only territory, it is also a war for culture. I think Putin and his regime are terrified of a country that they cannot completely control so close to their border. If liberalism, democracy and concepts of freedom were to flow back into Russia and it’s puppet states this would be bad news for Putin.  2014 revolution of the Maidan is terrifying to Putin and his regime. 

I now believe that majority of the Russian forces that have attacked thus far really are cannon fodder meant to weaken and tire the Ukrainians for what’s to come.  I think Putin and his general’s fully expected this level of resistance (the concept of Ukrainians meeting them with flowers was a lie Russia put out on purpose but didn’t actually believe themselves)

Two things can be true:
-Russians had hoped to topple the Ukrainian government quickly.
-if this didn’t happen then the back up plan would be to appear as if you are trying to minimize damage to infrastructure and to the civilians but then resort to reducing the resistant cities to rubble and then mopping up whatever resistance is left over.

In 2014 the police used live rounds on the protesters at Maidan who were not well armed. In 2022 I am afraid we will see overwhelming force used again on Ukrainians.

Why else would Russia risk the ire of the west and endure economic hardship if it wasn’t their own very existence on the line? The same type of political polarization that pits us against each other in the west will eventually find itself in Russia.
