Yeah I wasn't referring to those, they're still bad but they're considered eastern yeah. It was just a bit of an extra detail.

&gt;there is pretty universal opposition to it along with what I think is pretty clear opposition to the current Russian government.

Not really, the person I met over from there was before 2011 and he told me about the atrocious before the US even say anything. The US ignored all the calls for this genocide, they only used it when their relations with China deteriorated. Don't ever think that any of the Uyghurs look for the US to rescue, they know that they're only doing that for their interests not because they're humanitarians or care about their lives. US backed govs in the MENA started deporting these Uyghurs at one point, there was once that I had these Uyghurs that I knew taken from their neighborhood deported back and since then I've never heard from them, I have no idea what happened to any of them. The neighborhood I lived in had alot of foreign students, refugees and expats. So I got to see the police going in taking some of them. [It made the news I think back then.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/world/asia/egypt-muslims-uighurs-deportations-xinjiang-china.html) and to this day they're still hunting the rest down to deport them. This wasn't us the Egyptians, this was the government the US itself brought to power.

That's not entirely true since they unanimously supported that invasion but I see your point. And that is the one of the problem, the propaganda machine is always there before you.

I wonder why,, it's almost as if no one wants to fight their own country men for some fat business man elsewhere. Almost all of the US allies are like that, they're nothing without them... ANA fell the moment the US left because they had no reason to exist anymore, they were a levy force of a satrap not a country of their own. US isn't that smart at as they seem, they never learn from their mistakes.

&gt;Stop looking to the past and blaming the West for your problems.

Seriously? that is the most douchey thing you can ever say. THE WEST IS THE PROBLEM, to this day they won't let us govern ourselves, they still fund dictators and create puppet regimes, when we fight them we're labelled terrorist and turned into outcasts. Even as the US is now coming to an end they're handing their mantle to a new oppressors, Russia, Iran, Israel or Turkey.... some of which they're enemies of but they prefer them to rule us than us ruling ourselves. I know this because the US fights the culture itself, no matter how amount of deals people try to make with the US they mostly refuse the conditions even when they're at their most reasonable state because they don't fight just because of the oil, that is what I found out way later.

&gt;Police your own people better so other countries don't try to do it for you.

Sure, if you just let me and recalled all your men and also stopped sucking from that oil bosom, I'll get on to it.

&gt; Establish a group of people who have morality, honor, dignity, and bravery to enforce the values you hold so dear.

Sure we have all that, just not the same way you define it. The people who have honor are fought by the US.

&gt;Until you address your own internal issues- the West shouldn't even be on your mind.

\*sigh\* the west has it's dicks up our noses, so much that we can even focus on anything else. but ofc it's easy to say that from your place, no offense.",6affdfb19c09fa3251328736a0939ae97644a0da,True,False,,,,,0,1647213784,,0,{},i0jvon3,True,t3_td9vnr,False,True,t1_i0jre4p,/r/war/comments/td9vnr/on_this_day_little_abeer_qasim_was_savagely_raped/i0jvon3/,1647213799,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647184984.0,,,,

I grew up in Egypt, my family like most Egyptian families had anti-western sentiment but it's not really the reason why I too started have those, I never really thought about these stuff when I was young and I was mostly influenced by western media anyway. But as I grew up I met alot of fellow Muslims starting from school all the way to collage, Uyghurs, Russian Muslims, Chechens; Iraqis, Syrians, even Afghans and Pakistanis when I started going abroad, and then I've met and seen people who have actually been to western countries and I heard all their experiences and what everyone of them had to endure either from Russian genocides, Chinese ""cultural"" conversion or American bombing back when they invaded. Where I'm from started having the effects of American interference, Coups started happening. Governments that are directly funded by the West and the only reason they even exist is them shooing down unarmed protesters, break in houses and take people for no reason, young men who protested all that getting to have to spent their entire lives in political prisons.... You get the point. I started going online and now seeing us being blamed for all this eventhough we fought as hard as we can (maybe not hard enough) just made me hate the west even more tbh. Also as someone who likes history (as alot do) I started sensing the historical revisionism alot of western do. and also seen how Americans and Brits orchestrated two other coups before I was born, also in other neighboring countries. Overall seeing hypocrisy and double standards from the westerners when it comes to MENA people is just something.

The wars U.S engaged in since have been seen as unjust by the people- putting tons of pressure on American politicians and companies. We've literally held the leash of our own war machine. On top of that, any U.S soldier who intentionally brings harm to civs here or abroad MUST answer to a court of his peers. There's still members of PMC's/USM doing life for atrocities committed in the Middle East.

The American people stood up, was incarcerated, gave up their ways of life in support of holding back the war machine. At one point, even going so far as to sabotage military operations in the past. The American people wouldn't do this if they hated you or your way of life.  


That being said, it's undeniable that the U.S had witnessed atrocities committed by the people of the Middle east, against the people of the Middle East on a way larger scale. They couldn't even establish a modern police force due to the amount of Middle Eastern soldiers who refused to give up their ""Tea Boys"", would sell equipment for dope, would defect upon meeting of resistance, and whose combat training yielded similar results as a chimp with an AK.   


Stop looking to the past and blaming the West for your problems. Police your own people better so other countries don't try to do it for you. Establish a group of people who have morality, honor, dignity, and bravery to enforce the values you hold so dear. Until you address your own internal issues- the West shouldn't even be on your mind.

I personally think we should stay on our side of the water, we have to many problems in our own country to worry about and the money would be better used on that. But I realize that if we don’t get involved in some cases, it’s bad news. 

Examples… 
1) WW2… Europe was basically under Nazi control before the US got involved. Russia was holding them off in the west, but wasn’t making any progress until the US got involved and forced them to defend themselves on 2 fronts.
2) Korea- though limited in success, the North had at one point taken over nearly the entire peninsula and if the US didn’t get involved all your Kpop bands and Korean based anime (who do you thinks animates it) wouldn’t exist as all of South Korea would be under the north’s dictatorship. 
3) Afghanistan- we went in fought hard and helped them maintain a peaceful government were women had rights, and people weren’t slaves. We pull out and within days the Government is run by the taliban. Women and children are sexually assaulted and dehumanized, children are being sold into marriages with old men to be slaves.

Libya was a shithole under Gaddafi, all of his ""programs"" were a joke, Libya's healthcare was mediocre and the education was terrible. 

He put the country in pointless wars, lost all of them, funded terrorist groups, funded the worst regimes in Africa, kept Libya repressed and unable to develop 

This guy had gas stations all over Africa, with his face plastered all over them, and yet somehow his country did not develop like the Gulf countries? Very strange 

Libya had the world's 8th largest oil reserved and like 4 million (?) people. I won't even expect ghaddafi to make it like Norway or some Scandinavian country, but the bare minimum he could have done was make his country another Qatar, Kuwait or UAE. His citizens could have lived extremely prosperous lives and would have been doing wheelies on gold plated jeeps.

Fuck that guy.

West Ukraine would be more or less inhabitable until cleanup can be done, like with Chernobyl, but with less fallout spreading through Europe. Putler will get Kyiv, and Ukraine seises to exist.

This is a truly sadistic and horrendous event and is widely used within our organizations to try and root out the environments where things like this happen. There are bad people everywhere. 

I am not here to debate who is good and who is bad or if the war in Iraq was right or wrong. War is horrible and unimaginable things happen in war. I have carried my fare share of dead children from suicide bombers. This targeted rape and murder should never happen and yet it happens around the world all the time. Little kids are abducted, raped and killed in the United States. I do appreciate your post though as I do remember this incident every single year and speak about it with those around me so we can all learn from the evil that exists out there regardless of where you are from.

I think the vast majority of veterans would actually agree that they met some of the best people they know in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Hard working civilians trying to make it through life with very little in a war zone and they will offer you their last piece of bread in a heartbeat. At the end of the day it is a very sad thing that innocent lives are lost in these conflicts. I would say the United States and other NATO countries try to limit collateral damage quite a bit more than the Russians launching entire volleys of unguided MLRS munitions into towns and cities, but it doesn't take away from the fact that innocent people have died at the hands of both. 

Not to take away from your post I would like to pay my respects to those tragically murdered in this incident.

NATO will for SURE intervene if Russia attacks the Baltics states, the only reason Russia has not attacked Baltic states is because it knows NATO will intervene and they know they will not be able to win that fight.

You NUKES argument is kinda lame, ur whole argument assumes that once Russia attacks NATO (any NATO member) the response from NATO will be NUKES, well not really, NATO does not have to use NUKES if Russia attacks NATO because NATO knows they will win the conventional war against Russia. Russia also knows it cannot win a conventional war with its ramshackle excuse of an Army and it knows that its only way to fight and even then get a draw (MAD) is the Nukes, so the real question is why would Russia play all this mouse and cat game and attack the Baltic NATO states when it knows.it will ultimately have to resort to NUKES, why not just go for the NUKES and cut the crap?!

The point is all these nukes talk are cheap talk, Russia (USSR) did jot resort to nukes when it was at the peak of its power in 1969 during the Sinno Soviet conflict.

Also there is this video on youtube i think brezhnev or some other soviet leader yelling and threatening to nuke the world.

So to sum it up,it is simple.

We have an almost full information game here:

Players: Russia and NATO

A) Russia knows it cannot beat nato in a conventional warfare.
B) NATO knows it can beat Russia in a conventional warfare.

Game type: extensive form game

Since NATO would never attack Russia and is a defensive packt the first move is up to Russia.

In the beginning russia has two moves, Attack nato in a conventional warfare or not, if it does not attack it is all good, if it does then NATO as the second player moves and has to options, respond with conventional warfare and win or don't respond with conventional warfare and lose, so the optimal move is to respond and engage in a conventional warfare and win, then again russia has a move to escalate it to a nuclear warfare woth nato and no one wins, both lose, so as u can see the optimal option is from the start do not attack and no one loses.",81913bb8dfd70eaeb9971fb51973354df1ff894f,True,False,,,,,0,1647165581,,0,{},i0h5yq0,False,t3_tcqxco,False,True,t3_tcqxco,/r/war/comments/tcqxco/scenario_in_my_head_i_cannot_shake/i0h5yq0/,1647165598,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647136781.0,,,,

In fact, I will go so far as to say that this whole thing was set up with the consent of all parties involved. Not counting the civilians who are being brutalized of course, because we little people never count. America has been addicted to war since it's inception, and our economy is addicted to the Federal Reserve dollar, which is addicted to war, so every time we finish one war we have to start another one to keep our economy going. World War II ended, the economy went into recession, so we started fighting in korea. Korea ended, and we had to get involved in Vietnam. Vietnam ended, and we had a few years of Cold War, but then when that ended, we attacked Iraq, which was our best ally in the region up until they weren't. We managed to drag that out long enough to get an actual hot war started in Afghanistan and Iraq, and now that those have finally ended, we have to have another war to keep things going. 
In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act and the income tax act were both passed, and then the next year World War I began. This is not coincidence. It's got nothing to do with governments, or nations, or generals, but with bankers. The bankers control the flow of money, and they decide who goes to war and when. They decide the winners and the losers, and nobody else's opinion matters. As long as we continue to fall for the bullshit that the government and their media propaganda organizations feed us, we will continue to deserve to suffer.",4f526d7d23530b500b8763ef060965406b659f04,True,False,,,,,0,1647150363,,0,{},i0gmhbc,False,t3_tcjmrp,False,True,t3_tcjmrp,/r/war/comments/tcjmrp/is_there_a_chance_the_war_in_ukraine_would_become/i0gmhbc/,1647150375,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647121563.0,,,,

Congratulations we have verifiable proof that this is Irpin P30 bridge. 

[liveuamaps](https://liveuamap.com/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60506682) and [Sky news](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-mapped-the-story-so-far-in-maps-and-charts-12564145) are all in an agreement that Russian forces are just north of Irpin and the only major roads out of Irpin are towards the Russians or via the two bridges. P30 and the [rail bridges](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.5109773,30.2579533,3a,58.6y,26.56h,81t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1slGtP39svOfaNmpT-yOVnyg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i52) that are both destroyed. 

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that civilians don't want to be in a war zone. so obviously they'd evacuate. 

We know the Ukrainian forces are using yellow armbands and I'm doubtful they'd bring in paid actors to act like refugees.
