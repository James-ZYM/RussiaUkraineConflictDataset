I'm all for deserters. Seriously, I think the earlier deserters lay down their weapons, the less responsibility for war actions they should face. They should be granted refugee status in another country too. Those who desert later should be held responsible but get a chance to restore the country they fought to show good will. People become deserters because they want to live and not kill, or because they realized they're killing on the wrong side of a conflict. And that should be honored.

But I also understand that they get shot. Soldiers who desert aren't just missing numbers. They're a serious security breach. If a soldier dies, it's one less. He will be replaced and they move on. If he survived and deserts to the enemy, he can give the enemy intel or compromise security of military camps. One deserter may kill thousands of his own people, if he knows enough. And if he doesn't tell voluntarily, the enemy might torture or blackmail him to get what he knows. And then the whole morale thing. Deserters lower the morale of their home troops. That's why every military shoots them.

And yet he keeps this going, he started ordering the killing of civilians, of children, the bombing of maternities and hospitals that pose no risk whatsoever for his military advancements.
This are obviously actions of an old mad man, cornered and unable to accept his defeat (nor mistakes, instead he blames and puts under arrest his people, for not winning this war faster).
So please explain to me, where do you get any indication that he wouldn't nuke us all, the second he gets directly confronted by nato (who's military power is definitely stronger, and would absolutely destroy russia through a conventional war).
I know it makes you feel better to believe, that people with so much power are sane and would never do such a thing, but unfortunately reality suggests otherwise. NON of his actions have indicated so far otherwise.

[],False,,CriticalPolitical,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_1694i1ub,False,False,"It’s not a perfect idea, I was just thinking of the logistics of what a “safe zone” for Russian soldiers to realistically defect to would be because if what Russian soldier POWd are saying is true and there are firing squads behind many of the soldiers on the front line who are Russian soldiers, how would they get to that safe area without being shot? It might also help if Ukraine offered more money for useful intelligence given by Russian soldiers who lay down their weapon. I just saw that this thread’s original comment gave an idea of a “safe zone” for Russian soldiers to safely defect to without being shot by their own military and was just thinking out loud about what that might look like because by the sound of it, many Russian soldiers don’t want to fight this war. Morale is already low for Russian soldiers. Imagine if we could get half of an entire battalion to get to this safe location to surrender…how much lower would the remaining Russian soldiers morale be then? Now image this but to a much larger scale…it might save many more lives overall in the long run if we could successfully find a way to protect Russian soldiers who truly want to defect from getting shot from their own. Again, I’m open to other ideas, I was just putting that out there.

Second fact, Ukrainians aren't belligerent. They are being invaded.   
Another History lesson, Germany didn't have satellite nations.   
More facts, WW2 started with Japan invading Manchuria in 1931. Not with Pearl Harbor or with the NAZI and USSR invasion of USSR.  


Examples in history. America's proxy war in Korea. MacArthur wanted to nuke China with 50 atomic bombs. ""Buck Stops Here."" Truman fired Douglas MacArthur because a nuclear attack on China would have brought the USSR into a full scale Nuclear Attack on The USA.  


Second example: Vietnam, a proxy War of he West vs Communist Countries. Supplies rolling in from China and Russia. Only way to have really stopped it was to invade Cambodia and drive right up to China. Didn't happen.. why? Because that would have lead to a Nuclear War.

The USA will not be invading Russia, nor will we be invading China. Simply because they both have nukes. What will be happening is a continued proxy war across the globe. WW3 has already started. USA and NATO are rushing supplies, weapons, money, logistics, and intelligence to Ukraine. Blows are to be had. Watch closely what other Countries start doing. Maybe you'll prove it to yourself in time... maybe you are of the age to get sent to the frontlines.... maybe then you will realize it.... then again......   


Every nuclear super power knows full well that nukes end it all. Every Nation knows that to invade a Nuclear Super Power is a swift nuclear retaliation. It is insurance that the homeland is not invaded. Think we Americans will ever invade North Korea? Think again dep-dip. Not as long as they have nukes.   


Wars are not always ended with another Country being invaded and wiped out. Example, Germany in WW1, which ended with Germany still a Country and not invaded by the allies and wiped out. No, Absolutely Not, Never Ever will we Americans at anytime in the near future going to be invading Russia or China.

NATO also bombed civilians in Yogoslavia, Serbia, Kosovo, Lybia and the list goes on. The European Union has consistently breached international law and the 1951 Refugee convention, causing physical and mental trauma or death to millions of people fleeing war. 

It's easy for us in the West to cry out shame on Russians from the comfort of our smartphones with access to free press, freedom of speach and a judiciary system. If we had resisted our own governments and held them accountable, they may have considered halting their friendly trade with Putin when he did the exact same thing in Georgia, Chechnya, Crimea or Syria in the past decade. 

WE need to wake up and stop tolerating this humanitarian racism which makes us so mobilised for the cause of victims who look like us while turning a blind eye to our own states' war crimes against people who don't look so much like us.

-Forcible drafting is done in every society. We see it in America, the capitalist center of the world; we had a draft just a few decades ago for Vietnam and still require adult men to sign up for the draft. We see forced conscription in medieval history and throughout all time.

-A monopoly on information was a tactic used by certain communist dictators, sure, but it was/is also used by fascist states, theocracies, and many other authoritative countries.

-Lying about casualty numbers? Shit, that's just called ""war""! Nobody gives accurate information about casualties, especially when they're getting their asses kicked!

-The arresting of non-violent protesters isn't exclusive to communism, unfortunately. America has always arrested non-violent protestors, especially those who opposed slavery, Jim Crow and other racial inequity, and pointless wars overseas.


What Communism is, is the economy owned by the people. Now, to make things really confusing, Stalin claimed to be a communist, but he didn't give the economy to the people. He controlled it himself. It's not uncommon for dictators to just lie about what their country is, look at North Korea's claims to be a democracy! If words truly mean things, Stalin's claims that the Soviets were communist is just a straight up lie. So Russia was never communist, and isn't restoring communism.

Russia isn't communist because it has private industry. Anyone can start a business. There is an owning class of private individuals who own almost all of the resources. This is the definition of capitalism.

Putin is a piece of shit, and the whole world would benefit from him and his regime being shut down as soon as possible, but they are not communists.",62085fec5f58ed5c3b92e4c95addd8de4d4501dc,True,False,,,,,0,1647121681,,0,{},i0f3act,False,t3_tbumz2,False,True,t1_i0f1l6b,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tbumz2/arming_ukraine_is_worth_the_risk/i0f3act/,1647121696,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647092881.0
