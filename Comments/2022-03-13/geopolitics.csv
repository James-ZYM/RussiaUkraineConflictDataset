War map for the evening of March 13

The most high-profile military event was a precision-guided attack on AFU training centers in the village of Starichi and at the Yavorivsky military training ground in the Lviv region. Foreign mercenaries were stationed there, with 180 deaths reported.

The situation with Izyum has become clearer: there is still fighting in the southern part of the city. There, on a kind of peninsula, which is formed by a bend in the Seversky Donets River, an enemy battalion has entrenched itself. The bridges over the river were blown up by the AFU. Only the foot bridge remains, which is not easily held by our motorized riflemen. Our troops established pontoons below Izyum and there were battles near them for two days, but eventually we managed to cross and continue the offensive. In the battles for Izyum, we had to break through a serious defense organized by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The LNR army continues its offensive near the Severodonetsk agglomeration, and artillery is being reinforced. Fighting is going on in Rubizhne and Popasna. The rest of the Donetsk front is also advancing, with explosions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Ugledar and Avdeevka. In response, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again struck the Donetsk market. Reports came in that our forces had entered Gulyaypole, but fighting continued there, and they also shelled Ugledar, flanking it.
In Kharkiv and Mariupol the picture is the same as yesterday. Explosions and urban skirmishes.

In the Nikolaev region, our troops are fortifying and expanding their positions. Mykolaiv is blockaded on three sides, and point-blank strikes are being launched.

On the Kiev front, the main news today is the arrival of Kadyrov. Fighting continues in the same directions.

If you look back to the 2016 election, note that Hillary focused heavily on Trump's character failings - particularly the misogyny and implicit racism behind his platform and its target audience.  Her campaign slogan was ""I'm with her"" and a lot of the top line value propositon was around her gender identity and what it means culturally for a woman to be president.   I'm simplifying for sake of brevity, but ultimately the election was a referendum on white nativism vs urban cosmopolitanism.

Hindsight is of course 20/20, and she did win the popular vote, but I suspect she would have won concincingly enough in the popular vote to carry the electoral college had she focused, as her husband did, on economic platform rather than projecting cultural preferences and identity politics of the urbanite college educated.

As we all saw, the Democrats at the national level doubled down on liberal/conservative culture war across all major platform issues over the ensuing 4 years.  Where pragmatists like Bill Clinton created economic messaging that appealed to both urban and rural, beyond racial identity, the party ran the opposite direction during the Trump years and turned every issue into a platform for racial and gender justice.  Including foreign policy.

The foreign policy path the US has committed to since WW2 is frankly incompatible with the DNC platform messaging at the moment.  So it will be interesting to see how Biden manages this tightrope.  I develop solar across southern Africa and its amazing to see how quickly his admin has abandoned actually trying to compete with China re:infrastructure investment, when doing so was a stated platform foreign policy goal.  Groups like Power Africa don't even have offices in countries like Namibia, where you have the best solar irradiation on the planet + cooperative, pro business government.",7a579adb20b2b783ddb282388bc91f3181e9ab65,True,False,,,,,0,1647206920,,0,{},i0jfveg,False,t3_tcnap7,False,True,t1_i0iotsy,/r/geopolitics/comments/tcnap7/what_does_putin_think_hes_doing_an_experts_primer/i0jfveg/,1647206935,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647178120.0,

If Russia collapses, maybe it somehow stays somewhat whole a la the RFSR's transformation into the Russian Federation, which mostly survived except for Chechnya- or like the February Revolution, and it has a chance at staying whole.

[],False,,Abyssight,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ende,False,False,"The analysis makes some assumptions that are very optimistic in favor of the US. The reality is certainly not going to play out that way.

First of all, the EU and the US are not as united as it looks now. Russia's aggression presents an imminent threat at the EU's eastern frontiers. This is the only reason France and Germany quickly signed up for the unprecedented sanctions. Germany also has finally become aware of its untenable energy policies (thanks Merkel). I fully expect the unity against Russia to endure. However, the author makes an assumption that this unity will *also* persist against China. This is certainly not going to happen. To the EU, China is not a nearby threat, and is a far larger economy that they simply cannot antagonize too much. It is not in EU's economic interest to stay firmly on Americans side against China. They would much rather watch on the side lines. The article predicts that the global power struggle will become democracy vs authoritarian. This is pure neoliberal fantasy. 

Second, the article predicts that ""NATO will continue to expand"". But Sweden and Finland are the only realistic candidates and it is still far from certain that they will join. The article also says ""U.S. influence in the non-Western world will increase"". But Saudi Arabia, India, and Pakistan are not co-operating with the US on Russia. Turkey is going its own way, and they have their own motives when it comes to Russia. South East Asian countries are hedging between China and the US, and will never commit to one side unless there is a clear winner in the regional struggle.

Moreover, unless China blatantly aids Russia, no one is seriously going to sanction or reduce trade with China. The inflation is already running dangerously high, and further trade disruption will make things a lot worse. The American mid-term elections are coming up and there will be many unhappy voters. The EU are even less willing to confront China. This means China has more room to manoeuvre than the article suggests.

Based on these unrealistic assumptions, the article paint a picture of China becoming more isolated if it stays neutral or backs Russia. It also overstates the case for keeping reputation and goodwill. But China has faced nothing consequential over the Uighurs, and have turned many elites in the West to their side through lucrative business opportunities and donations.

[],False,,gudtoomes,,,[],,,,text,t2_8nfi29k9,False,False,"Very interesting read, especially given the source. In terms of scenario thinking, what he states is definitely possible, and even one of the more likely scenarios.

Assuming competent action and governance from the West, Russia does look likely to fail regardless in the short term or in the long term, and be left severely weakened.

With Russia out of the picture, one of the possible scenarios is that it could result in a world where 'western' allied countries increase in unity, and unite vs China, resulting in them being more isolated.

The main thing I would say is that I can just see alternative scenarios occurring too.

1) The European region grows more independent, and won't 'risk it all' to join in the 'fight' against China since they are relatively 'far away' from most consequences.

The US is a 'democracy' only in name, given it's run by oligarchs through 'open bribery' via lobbying. It also has a increasingly polarised democrats vs republican split, combined with a rotting economic system where a increasingly disillusioned middle class (arguably even the lower upper class) and below are increasingly being left behind. 

All this is setting up for the US to undergo a lot of potential internal instability in the relatively short run (could go out of control if a lot of those problems don't get fixed), and trust me the Europeans (and the rest of the world) will be and are already watching and asking themselves 'what is wrong with the US'? Should we really follow their lead?? There could even be doubts regarding whether the US has the right to call itself the 'leader' of democracy if the inequality and political polarisation in the country continues to increase as far as I'm concerned.

Especially when the European market is already larger than the US market on it's own, and as the eastern european countries catch up, will only grow larger and larger relative to the US.

Simply put, the US doesn't have the same level of dominance and soft power it had in the past, hence will the europeans put their necks (purses) on the line for some imaginary 'ideological' conflict between the US and China, especially if China won't hit the europeans first (there is no major competition between China and the EU)?

Maybe to a minor extent, but I'm doubtful it'll happen to a major extent unless openly provoked. Hence, the point is, I don't see the scenario mentioned by the analyst becoming as one sided as he suggests.

2) Money/trade matters. Japan/SK/Taiwan will definitely continue to work with the US, but I don't see it being again as one sided in the longer run. Given my read on human nature, people are loss aversive, hence, money will always come before any 'ideological' conflict - unless of course ones security becomes threatened. However, even then, as long as enough money is on the line, people (especially those not on the front line) are willing to play the game and risk more. As a consequence, given that China is already their biggest trading market, and the defacto market of the future, I again, don't see them committing economic suicide for some 'ideological' conflict unless again, the Chinese threaten their security to an extreme extent. Money matters most, and corporations influence politics (just to different degrees).

Other things I'd say I'd kinda disagree on, or at least would say needs deeper analysis is 1) Is russia truly dead in the longer run, 2) whether the 'international' community really cares that much about Ukraine (to me, the worry was more about Putin threatening to bring nukes, which inevitably drags the whole world into it) in the long run especially given my read on human nature, and whether the international community is 'choosing sides' (to me they care more about their self-interest, which is that the destabilization caused by Putin should stop, than some again 'ideological' conflict), 3) whether the Chinese really have to openly throw Russia under the bus to 'satiate' the imagined 'international community' as a result (to me a lot of the world is already losing interest, now that the initial threat of potential utilization of nukes is becoming forgotten).",0820b48fb7458e26193219bd2189ee26fb716fc6,True,False,,,,,0,1647196965,,0,{},i0istpq,False,t3_td8f3t,False,True,t3_td8f3t,/r/geopolitics/comments/td8f3t/possible_outcomes_of_the_russoukrainian_war_and/i0istpq/,1647196976,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647168165.0,

[],False,,AC_Merchant,,,[],,,,text,t2_fda0g,False,False,"I think the biggest issue for China is whether it views Europe or Russia as more important. The rest of the world has already mostly made up their minds about China and are not gonna change their minds based on their response to the war. Europe and Russia are the two with the most at stake and where China's position could have impact. With this I think there are a 3 main questions:  
1. How ideological is Europe, and are they willing to take a side against China in the New Cold War even if they stand more to gain economically by playing both sides?  
2. How much does China have to gain by Russia, Europe and the US distracted by Ukraine?
3. How important is Russia as a potential ally?  
I think the answer to the first is a toss up, the answer to the second is a little, and the answer to the last is a lot.
To expand, Russia is unlikely to have a West oriented government anytime soon. Even if Putin falls and they withdraw from Ukraine, there will still be the issue of Crimea which Russia is never giving up. Additonally even if Ukraine is only a small distraction for the West, it's still helpful in delaying the Pivot to Asia which is good for China as time is on its side. If China helps out Europe and sanctions Russia they risk alienating a potential ally with little gain. Are we really as naive to believe the world will warm up to China just because they side with them on one issue? For China allies are hard to come by and Russia would be a very powerful one. The world has changed a lot since the Sino-Soviet split and both countries are much less ideological and much more pragmatic. I think China would do good to cultivate ties with them as even if they are a declining power they are a power nonetheless with a powerful military and tons of natural resources.  
For these reasons I think China should stay officially neutral on the issue while cultivating ties with Moscow behind closed doors. Europeans may say China is outrageous for staying neutral but I very much doubt it would have a lasting impact like taking a side would. If Europe turns against China it will regardless of the Ukraine issue. Russia on the other hand is much more lenient and would see Chinese neutrality as a relative good given the sanctions of other regimes. By staying neutral China can minimize angering other countries while potentially opening up a diplomatic opportunity with Russia for the years ahead.",b2498b59e891d023d60b4d04d30122ffa62d9ff1,True,False,,,,,0,1647192239,,0,{},i0ihc3v,False,t3_td8f3t,False,True,t3_td8f3t,/r/geopolitics/comments/td8f3t/possible_outcomes_of_the_russoukrainian_war_and/i0ihc3v/,1647192254,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647163439.0,

The policy of containment worked for the USSR because our economies were not deeply intertwined. Similarly, the US economy is not deeply intertwined with Russia. Even the EU isn't that connected with Russia. The US, EU, Japan, and South Korean economies are deeply intertwined with China. 

A containment policy aimed at China would cause the price of goods to skyrocket. As it stands, the united States is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis that is making a comfortable living unattainable for a significant portion of the population. Throwing unaffordable consumer goods on top of unaffordable housing, child care, elderly care, and education is a recipe for a economic turmoil, which would lead to political strife.

China, unlike Russia, does not pose a threat to Europe. So it really does not make sense for Europe to isolate China and throw their economy into the toilet.

The American public tends to look at geopolitics in moralistic terms and framing, and the Democratic party since 2016 has focused heavily on making their approach on every major issue a referendum on respectability politics - both domestic and foreign policy wise.

Biden is a very experienced foreign policy person.  He was involved with the Obama admin during the 2014 war in Crimea, and was in the senate as a major foreign policy expert in 2004.  He is as intimately familiar with Ukraine-Russia as any elected official in the US.  And this was the path he chose.

To me, it suggests 1 or more of the following

1) He felt sanctions would cripple Russia's war machine before it could achieve strategic objectives in case of invasion

I don't dispute that Putin is authoritarian and jailing of protestors is wrong but so many other countries, this does not remove legitimacy to his leadership. I know people who got fined in London during the past lockdown for just standing in a park, this is also wrong and happened in a place considered liberal. About removing selected unwanted information, this is actually a distinctive characteristic of the West over the last 2 years, the removal of RT is just the latest example. There is no real freedom of information in the West.

&gt;There is no government mandate or law compelling them. Ditto all the companies leaving Russia. 

It's not by chance, there is a politically organised hate campaign towards Russia, imposed sanctions and political pressure that caused many companies to join in and boycott Russia.
When the USA invaded Iraq using some lies as an excuse, I don't remember any sanction being imposed against the USA. Clearly there is a double standard and the main reason for the hate campaign against Russia is not really humanitarian, it's because the USA democrats have invested billions in Ukraine.
Remember that Ukraine is neither part of NATO nor part of the European Union.

&gt;millions fleeing death and destruction

I'm not denying people fleeing, I believe the Zelenskyy regime does not allow men to go. I haven't seen much footage, I'm sure there is devastation and civilians have died and that's very sad, however the Ukrainian army decided to bring the war to the towns using civilians as a shield, instead of fighting far away.

&gt;The cause is the invasion and war that Russia started not the world stopping business with a hostile Russia

Russia has not been ostile with the West so the West is jumping on the bandwagon of hostility to Russia.

The author that you mentioned wrote some good articles, but I disagree with his twist and point of view. If I have to choose a side, I stand with Russia because I understand the historical reasons that led to the war. Russian people living in the Donbass region have been killed for 8 years, this is ignored by western media but shown on RT. I think RT is much better at showing the historical truth of the problems between Russia and Ukraine than the hypocritical pro-NATO western media.

We all consider this army low on morale.

But an army low on morale would disperse and desert more easily. No chance anybody sane is going to fight if he sees 9 in 10 people around him getting killed one after another while marching in a stupid line on a street.

The longer the war takes with them advancing, the more I think it might not be the case.

The claim of 13k dead russian soldiers is also an indirect claim having wounded 100k more. We all know, dead soldiers are a tiny minority of the shot and wounded soldiers.

Ukraines claims are so far as hilarious as Russian ones.

I do get the situation wrong, I got it wrong that Russia is not going to attack. I thought: they can not win a pure military confrontation. But now I see they can starve cities and then take them and go slowly one by one. This does not look doomed to me.

Military at least, in a humanitarian way it is all doomed and messed up.

You can not hold Kiev without food. Millions of refugees require a lot of work and help.

The foreign volunteers might be a serious liability in the long run, when they get captured by Russia and we have to negotiate the release.

I might be wrong, but this clusterfuck didn't even start yet, give it half a year. Processes started which will be impossible to reverse. Decoupling russian economy might lead to the situation of them having no reason not to massacre a million civilians and our only option of preventing it would be the death of millions more in a world war.

Our only plan is that ""Putin is marching towards his doom""... if this is not the case, .... we are more f'ed than ever, going to see chinese and syrian ""peace keepers"" in Europe. If Ukraine doesn't submit to Russia, it will submit to China to make it stop. Foreign peace keepers is the only possible way to achieve the stated russian goal of demilitarising Ukraine. I could imagine Ukraine not having a real military, but beeing jointly defended by a mix of EU-US-RU-CHI with a mandate by the United Nations.

The other nations just have to make sure they are not being economically taken advantage of by coordinated mercantilist policies. 

While the economic benefits of relatively unrestricted free trade have always been important to the LIO project, they are not necessarily absolutely essential. And there are still enormous economic benefits to be had with a more restrained Free Trade system where it is less about maximizing efficiency at all costs, and instead robustness and other national interests are factored in more heavily. This is still better than a colonial empire, siloed trade system where everyone has to run around with battleships protecting their own trading vessels and resource access, etc.",518bf08c1c38207d1406ebd97790de7e8914ebc4,True,False,,,,,0,1647161921,,0,{},i0h1kqq,False,t3_tah87d,False,True,t1_i00yyjx,/r/geopolitics/comments/tah87d/yoon_sukyeol_south_korea_needs_to_step_up/i0h1kqq/,1647161931,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647133121.0,

I just made a comment that seems logical to me: Australia and New Zealand are close partners of the US and NATO and belong to the Five Eyes so it means almost automatic adherance to the former's policy line. I honestly even forgot about them... Commercial activity between them and Russia is marginal. Take for instance New Zealand: it had a positive foreign trade balance with Russia - exports of around 170MM USD in 2021 and imports 60MM USD. As you can see, they are even losing more than they are gaining here with the sanctions, and yet that's nothing compared to trade between Russia and the UE which amounted around a quarter of a trillion dollars last year.

https://tradingeconomics.com/new-zealand/imports/russia

As I said, in the grand scheme of things it doesn't make much of a difference in terms of the sanctions themselves... and yet people are downvoting my previous comment. Why? It seems to me that people rather put their feelings before the practicality of the situation. 

It's the same with abstentions: UN resolutions are worthless if they are unenforceable. What matters for the sake of the economy are effective sanctions. Just an example (and again this is entirely factual):

For the 29th year in a row the UN General Assembly voted for the US to drop sanctions against Cuba. 184 countries voted in favor, two voted in favor - the US and Israel - and there were three abstentions: Colombia, Brazil and guess who else? Ukraine.

https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094612

Did the voting matter? Did Ukraine abstaining say anything about its government's political doctrine which counters the overwhelming will of the entire planet? Does this doctrine have anything to do with them being the only ones, besides the US that is, that voted against a resolution “combating glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance” (for which, BTW, Australia abstained) that passed at the end of last year with 130 votes in the UN General Assembly? Did these votes against and these abstentions matter in any significant way at all? 

https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094612 

https://www.yjc.news/en/news/55077/the-united-states-voted-against-a-resolution-condemning-nazism-and-racism

Ukrains negative vote doesn't even necessarily mean that they are for Nazism but maybe there are other plausible explanations, and I accept this for a fact, but then must make a logical decision here - and I believe you'll end up agreeing with me: Either votes against and abstentions do not necessarily reflect the political spirit of a country, in which case an abstention in the resolution against Russia might mean anything; or votes against and abstentions do reflect the political spirit of a country, in which case it means that Ukraine is pro-Nazism. 

I'm pretty sure that we don't agree with the second conclusion, so the first premise must be correct.

I suspect that I'm going to be downvoted again but I at this point I really don't care. I think my position on abstentions is quite clear and whoever thinks it makes any difference is simply deluding him or herself.",265b9050f1bd723c7605e8916b0f8542f6342650,True,False,,,,,0,1647161779,,0,{},i0h1eky,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_i0gusac,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i0h1eky/,1647161792,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647132979.0,

They have tremendous upside breakout potential, especially in the unlikely--but still quite possible--event that China reaches some game changing technology milestones ahead of the West. 

Still, China also has so many challenges. Even if left alone, China's demographic, political and economic challenges are significant. Finally, unlike the Soviet Union, China is not autarkic as a modern economy. China is, as a last resort, incredibly vulnerable to resource disruption strategies using American hard power.

So while hope is not a strategy, one also needs to avoid seeing one's adversary as 10 feet tall. Thus, I believe the US and the West are engaged in supply chain rebuilding at a moderate pace so as to minimize economic harm to themselves. Covid is also a factor. Undoubtedly, were China seen as a more imminent and dangerous threat, Western nations could supercharge the speed of this supply chain rebuilding process. But that would be much more costly. 

So I think that given Chinese vulnerabilities, and the economic damage Covid has already done, the West is taking a bit of a gamble that China won't invade Taiwan or cross over serious red lines in the next 3-5 years. If they do, the West will wish they had moved faster, but China should still be manageable. However, once Covid is firmly in the rear view mirror, and substantial supply chain rebuilding has been done, the West will have significantly more room to maneuver with respect to pressuring China. In addition, it is possible that during this time, the balance of probabilities with respect to China actually being able to successfully invade and conquer Taiwan quickly may also be altered in Taiwan's favor.

&gt; Putin has united the West, and caused the Europeans to take their own defence seriously - something that all post-Cold War American presidents have failed to do. 

This isn't true and is perhaps biased by Trump, who spiked US / EU relations and really started the ball rolling on militarisation. This came along with the migrant crisis (there's a reason why Frontex is the sole EU uniformed service to date).

&gt; Taiwan is not Ukraine, and the argument that China will take advantage of U.S. distraction over Ukraine to attack Taiwan is just silly.

One thing that is conspicuously left out is that the pandemic is still ongoing, and China is still committed to a zero-COVID policy amidst some of their biggest outbreaks yet. They have their own distractions as it is.

&gt; **Nilay Patel: Right now, the Biden plan, I think it’s $50 billion or $52 billion in incentives, subsidies. Is that enough? Is that the first payment? Is this something that needs to continue to start building more chips in the United States?**

&gt; Willy Shih: I would say it’s not bad for a down payment. I had somebody from deep within Washington call me up and ask me how much money it would take to catch up with TSMC. I had just been to the GlobalFoundries fab in Malta, New York, and they had spent $15 billion to get 30,000 wafer starts per month at 14 nanometers — so it’s not even leading edge, but it’s a nice fab. They’ve done a good job there. TSMC Fab 12 has a capacity of 250,000 wafer starts per month. TSMC Fab 14 has about 250,000. TSMC Fab 15 has about 250,000. TSMC Fab 18, they’re targeting the same capacity. So I told this person, “Oh, I don’t know. You’d probably have to spend 10 times what GlobalFoundries spent up in Malta, New York.” I could hear him fall out of his chair. And when he got back up, he said, “What did you say?” And I said, “I don’t know, 10 times that, $150 billion. Maybe it’s not $150 billion. Maybe it’s $130 or $140 billion. But you have to realize that TSMC is going to spend over $30 billion this year, and that’s one company. And they spent $20-plus billion last year, and they’ve been spending $10 to $20 billion a year for the last decade. And they’d been spending like $5 to $10 billion a year for the decade before that. So they’ve been pouring money into this for 35 years. So $52 billion — and by the way, all the lobbyists are in there trying to make sure that their company gets their share of it. By the time it gets peanut-buttered around, the worry will be, how much difference is it actually going to make?",3c186ab5e0972ea5d376ee0b1793e181ab84ece8,True,False,,,,,0,1647152427,,0,{},i0gpjms,False,t3_tavy3t,False,True,t1_i04m8ej,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavy3t/why_isnt_the_us_spending_more_money_to_speed_up/i0gpjms/,1647152442,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647123627.0,

Yes, they would. You are lacking information about who the Gülenists were. 


They were a factions within AKP or an ally to it. They provided the educated people necessary to run a government. By 2015, however, they weren't in favourite any more. A few of them got liquidated in corruption cases. And there were plans to liquidate even more. So the mission was suicidal because the group didn't have time. 

About the teachers. The Gülenist were never a military cliques. They were a group within the civil government. İn light of the 28 Feb, they provided educated people to fill in the positions. Their presence in the army was limitted. Coup attempt happened because some Kemalists allied themselves with the group.  

You talk about misinformation. I want you to consider the misinformation on your side. Consider the media you consume. Do you really think that the America  news would tell it was a real coup attempt? Especially when it is so obvious that it was a US Opération? Of course the international news would insist on it being a red flag. They would hang out to each and every thread of dubiousness. Combine that with the lack of knowledge about Turkish politics.

India’s dependency on Russia has left it reluctant to publicly criticise Russia’s war on Ukraine. Rather than pressure India to pick a side, the EU should show India that it is a serious geopolitical partner.  
Alongside 34 other countries, India abstained from the vote on the recent UNSC resolution condemning the Russian invasion. But, India signalled indirect disapproval of Moscow’s actions by stressing importance of “the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states” in its statements at UNSC.   
India’s foreign policy has focused on walking the fine line between Moscow and Washington while simultaneously navigating its relationship with Beijing. In this context, it seems to be an uncomfortable necessity for New Delhi to maintain a diplomatic balance on Ukraine.  
India is over-dependent on Russia on many fronts. Along with military hardware, Russia provides political and diplomatic support to India in international institutions such as the UN. India also imports strategic goods, such as  mineral oils, fertiliser, and nuclear technology from Russia.   
India has recognised that, and has started to diversify its portfolio, both economically, and militarily. India has strengthened its security cooperation with the US through bilateral agreements,  and deepened its multilateral engagement with the West through formats such as the Quad.   
India’s efforts to reduce its dependency on Russia are part of a complex, long-term process.  
Instead of intensifying pressure on India to openly choose a side, the European Union should think about what it can offer the country to help address its dilemma. EU should adopt a strategic approach to its trade policies. This is especially relevant for arms exports, which the union can use to strengthen partners such as India – thereby helping the country reduce its dependency on Russia while maintaining a balance in its relations with China and the US.",f9a479dc781028a217718f1946e38026a0088eb4,True,False,,,,,0,1647147724,,0,{},i0gia03,True,t3_tczhso,False,True,t3_tczhso,/r/geopolitics/comments/tczhso/why_indias_silence_on_ukraine_is_an_opportunity/i0gia03/,1647147741,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647118924.0,

Vladimir Putin was not made in Moscow rather in St Petersburg and the DDR where he served as a minor official in KGB Stasi Liaison in Dresden. It is certain that witnessing the fall of the DDR and its impact on the Stasi was a key event.

He did work as a taxi driver but many did back then as a side hustle. You simply drove along the road looking for customers, negotiated a price and then drove them to their destination. 

What was interesting are the various activities he got up to after returning. He was involved in a company founded with some other ex KGB types for disposing of some overseas property (to which he had no rights).  He then worked for his former professor who became Mayor/Governor of St Petersburg, Sobchak running the committee of foreign economic affairs. In this role he controlled all foreign business coming to the city including the establishment of the first foreign bank which was run by a former colleague from the Dresden Stasi. He also organised a massive deal by which metals would be exported from the city by the Tambov organised crime gang on return for money that would be used for the orphans. Something like $100m, but unfortunately it disappeared and Putin got richer.

The main points being are that he is scared of instability, he has a background as a corrupt bureaucrat and had contact with organised crime. The latter certainly influenced his later management style which was more that of crime boss.

Also in this time, he and his ex KGB friends (lookup the Ochrva Dacha Club) became more and more resentful if the money being made by those in the private sector that he thought was rightfully the property of those from the military and security areas. This was the foundation of his links to the *Siloviki*.

Sobchak lost the election as governor which upset Putin. He was quite loyal. At this point he seemed to decide that democracy was not for him. He left St Petersburg and moved to Moscow for a job with the Yeltsin administration which welcomed those who were loyal but with flexible morals.",cee529af80bb45440b088d98e2b55a913f1e51ad,True,False,,,,,0,1647147589,,0,{},i0gi1x6,False,t3_tcnap7,False,True,t1_i0ee68h,/r/geopolitics/comments/tcnap7/what_does_putin_think_hes_doing_an_experts_primer/i0gi1x6/,1647147607,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647118789.0,

I recently watched drone footage many of you all probably saw, of ukranians ambushing an armored column that appeared to be supported by infantry. The response to this ambush, as well as others I've seen was dismal, and appeared to be a reaction that a year ago, I would have expected to see from the afghan military, and not a supposedly tier 1 military force. I'm starting to think that Latvia and other Baltic states would stand a much better chance against Russia.

Russia can bring air support and overwhelming indirect fire on an enemy, but appears to be near worthless in up close combat. (I'm probably being over critical, but compared to the size and investment out into their military, it feels fitting).

🇺🇺🇦 Updated map of combat and territorial control in Ukraine by the end of March 12, 2022

❗️ The security ring around Volnovakha is expanding. There is fighting in Mariupol - there is not much change on the western flank, but an armored group managed to break through the defensive lines on the Vinogradne side.

❗️ Near Luhansk, there is fighting and shelling for Popasna and Rubizhne.

❗️ There are no particular changes in the Nikolaevsk direction: the Russian Armed Forces continue to reinforce their positions in Kashperovo-Nikolayivka and build up their grouping near Novovorontsivka for an offensive against Kryvyy Rih and Nikopol.

❗️ To the west of Kyiv, the Russian Armed Forces continue to block the highway to Zhytomyr and expand control around Makarov. To the east, there is fighting in the vicinity of Gogolev.

❗️ The AFU continues its attempts to counterattack near Izyum: fighting on the southern bank of the Seversky Donets. Approaching reinforcements in the vicinity of Balakleya are being hit.",fb4efbe2a208f29710907f3c733c722f47583f3b,True,False,,,,,0,1647132500,,0,{},i0fq333,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i0fq333/,1647132516,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647103700.0,

It's like this 'expert' is simply getting her ideas from mainstream news outlets and doesn't even question the geopolitical ramifications for Russia. Anybody that's pushing the 'denazification' narrative is misinformed IMO. Same goes for people who think it's just Putin's ego. The whole nazi angle is literally the Kremlin's PR. Why should we believe *anything* about the stated intent about the invasion?

When you look at it purely through a geopolitical lense the reasons are pretty clear:

1) Taking Ukraine pushes Russian influence closer to the Carpathian mountains, and makes it harder for NATO countries to project influence east

2) 50% of Russia's energy exports pass through Ukraine. As Ukraine strengthens western ties it becomes an economic threat to Moscow

3) Ukraine has the 2nd largest natural gas reserves in Europe and it's mostly untapped. If Ukraine starts extracting gas it'll make Russia much less competitive considering most of Europe is dependant on Russian energy.

4) If Russia takes the southern coast of Ukraine it can dominate the black sea, or at least contend with Turkey. It can stretch it's supply chains and project influence further into the middle east.

5) Russia is a failing state with a terrible economy and demography. They need to act now to preserve what little they have left. The won't be able to sustain their military in 10 years because there's not enough young men. Most of their skilled left when the USSR collapsed, and the ones that stayed will retire in 15 years. The Kremlin is trying to hold on to what little power they have left before Russia fully collapses.

If not for Russian leadership choosing to invade a democratic Ukraine would any of this happen? 

Western media draws clear distinction between Russian leadership and Russian people so far as to even call this ""Putin's War on Ukraine"". Putin is widely viewed as a dictator in the west that keeps Russian people misinformed by removing independent sources of information and jailing protestors, etc. 

-------

You say: ""operators following up from the above hate messages have already started boycotting the delivery of russian oil""

Workers that unload ships find what is happening in Ukraine so revolting they want nothing to do with unloading Russian ships. There is no government mandate or law compelling them. Ditto all the companies leaving Russia. 

People in the west see video footage of millions fleeing death and destruction with homes / hospitals / corpses on streets exploded by Russian weapons. Are you claiming this footage is fake? Do you consider that footage ""western propaganda with clear hate against Russia""? Why would millions of women and children abandon their homes and seek refuge in other countries?

-------
You say ""Russia also exports a huge amount of grains, western sanctions will also cause food shortages and famine particularly in poor countries in the middle East""

The cause is the invasion and war that Russia started not the world stopping business with a hostile Russia. When Russia stops invasion/war the sanctions stop. Please keep cause and effect straight.

-----------

You say: ""I'm not convinced that Putin will stop the war just because of sanctions""

You say ""I think the West should stop trying to punish Russia, take a more neutral stance, they should listen to Putin and""

I think you are genuine but you have the views and beliefs you do due to consumption of Russian state-owned news like ""RT News"". Please look up their reputation.
