But MY guess is about half of that 20 k is INJURED and about 1/4 of those injured are dead or gonna die from their injuries.
So all in all, probably about 3000 are dead or close to dying, and the rest of that 7,000 is injured and sent back home.

As a kid, I liked looking at military surplus catalogs (it was the '90s, print catalogs were still a big thing). One such was The Sportsman's Guide. It had a mix of surplus, sporting goods, and just odd things that military or hunting enthusiasts would like. One year they had a bunch of Russian toy T72s, I believe leftover from the late '80s (end of the Soviet era). They were battery powered and would drive forward or backward and the turret had a light that flashed. 

For whatever reason, the catalog gave you a discount on 2 of these things, and they were cheap. I asked for them for Christmas and was a happy boy when I got them, I liked tanks and weird foreign things.

So, the way you turned them on to make them go was a little rocker switch on the back of the engine that had three states, ""stop"" in the middle of the switch and ""go"" if you pushed it left or right. I obviously could not read Cyrillic but I could tell that both directions were marked by the same character even though one way was forward and the other was reverse.

So, one of these things seemed to work as intended, rock the switch left for forward, right for reverse. The other, however, had some exposed copper wiring sticking out of the switch that would spark gently when you turned it on, sometimes it wouldn't start at all, and the switch seemed to be backwards (right was forward and left was reverse).

I asked my dad why these two supposedly identical toys have opposite controls and one doesn't seem to work quite right.

So what we were talking about is that Z doesn't equate Swastika. Cause an army symbol isn't an ideology while Swastika is an evil ideology, do you get it? It's like comparing a german iron cross to Swastika. 

Sure, under the german iron cross, many experienced genocide. But is german iron cross Swastika? Clearly not, and you can see that germans have this symbol at the side of the tanks to this day.

Now compare Z symbol to german iron cross since both symbolizes army. So is Z comparable to swastika, no because Z is a battle group and swastika is an ideology. Like the german iron cross, many died under the Z symbol, but it isn't as evil as the ideology itself.

1.  Convoy looked too big and too dumb to be real- perhaps defending forces considered it a likely trap of some sort. Or perhaps international intelligence spotted something. Or there was just too much contested territory to venture into in any great force- as the smaller Ukrainian forces would be hesitant to group up too densely and make themselves a target.

2. Ukraine forces tied up defending a besieged Kyiv at the time.  President Zelenskyy had put his foot down on holding the capital, so a stuck convoy was less of a priority than stopping active and dangerous Russian forces within the city. 

3.  The convoy did have anti-air vehicles within it- quite a few of those fancy SAM trucks were in the length, so the dwindling air force might not have survived the attacks.

4.  Artillery does have a certain range, and it needs to be defended.  As related to previous points, perhaps defenders did not feel there was viable means to bring guns to bear on the convoy.

5. In the first weeks of the conflict, there was a hope that domestic pressure would force Putin to pull his troops back.  Perhaps as an additional consideration of any of the above points: Ukraine wanted to maintain the image of being the innocents in need of aid.  Should they accomplish a risky attack on the convoy, would that make them seem too successful and reduce the incoming military aid?",a6f3eb1bd486682a5824ee28bc0da41c24f094a3,True,False,,,,,0,1651564626,,0,{},i74uvkz,False,t3_ugx1lj,False,True,t3_ugx1lj,/r/war/comments/ugx1lj/why_didnt_ukraine_attack_russias_massive_vehicle/i74uvkz/,1651564642,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651535826.0,
