It just doesn't work that way. You need to actually try to understand what the fuck is going on in order for things to work. Other countries don't really care how tough your personality is when there's billions of not trillions of dollars on the line. There is nuance and a delicate balance to maintain. It is not a football game and if it is, it tends to not be very stable or very wise to invest in. So the whole ""strong man"" personality is attractive to people who think this is how the world is or how it should be. For them, maybe it is -- maybe they do really gain some good benefits by huffin and puffin around, it's just limited is all. You tend not to be able to achieve complex things for any sustained amount of time with ego involved, even if you wish it worked that way or tries to make it work that way, it just gets in the way. These people see Putin or Trump and they see someone like him putting off a bad boy vibe and they think ""I knew it was possible! He's like me! I knew being tough would make it work"" meanwhile behind the scenes, there is a lot of thought, albeit evil sometimes, that's goes into it, it's not just walking into rooms and yelling at people and MAKING IT HAPPEN, you will lose allies before long. So again, I think these people are offloading their need to understand what is happening and replacing it with ""trust for our leader"", but trust doesn't help you understand but it can be shoehorned into that slot in our minds. I think that's why people can sometimes get angry when you question them because it's like they've spent all this time balancing this precarious house of cards and well it IS standing... But ""Why are you trying to destroy it! I worked so hard on this!"". If a simple examination or prodding of it can destroy it... It's not very strong is it? Companies pay good money for penetration testing on their networks to make sure no one can break in when it matters.

I actually did not know reaper drones were now being sent since it did seem to contradict the secondary reasoning about offensive weapons.  

What surprised me was Jen's explanation for this which was confusing.  She didn't sate what I thought was obvious that the drones, which can be shipped in containers and easily re-assembled are not the same as flying Migs into a contested airspace from a US airbase (she did mention that last part though).  

Instead of admitting that the previous explanation of offensive vs defensive equipment is not the main reason and that they had made a mistake in statements she doubled down a bit and re-iterated the categorization of weapons which is just weird.

I think in her mind she wants to hone in on her previous point that the US would stop supplying military support of weaponry should Ukraine counterattack Russia in an offensive to go beyond it's borders but I might be misunderstanding something here.",c09d7c92a846e949120ae230aad76de49b960a6d,True,False,,,,,0,1647708742,,0,{},i1arzm0,False,t3_thwzpv,False,False,t3_thwzpv,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/thwzpv/jen_psaki_just_had_to_remind_fox_news_that_russia/i1arzm0/,1647708757,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647679942.0,,,,

if any news agency does not report that and tries to question the legitimacy of such nonsense, it will be banned and journalists jailed. so most of them are keeping quiet.

The red and black flag means different things to different people. It’s origin goes back to the 12th century. It was taken up and used by UPA, Ukraine’s Insurgent Army formed in 1942 with the goal of establishing an independent Ukraine after the war. UPA’s history is complex. Some see the flag as representing violent, far-right nationalism. Others see it as a symbol of the struggle for independence. The red stands for love; the black for sorrow, and how they are intertwined.

They had found their peace, they would have controlled the unrest in the east as well at some point. Now the cities are bombed, people had to flee, civilians dead... that's a loss compared to before.

However - just because Ukraine loses infrastructure, lives and potentially some land doesn't mean Putin wins. I'd say the contrary is true. His expectation that he can force Ukraine into an alliance or neutrality has already failed the moment he crossed the border. Putin has already lost, too. His situation is worse than before, too.

Both sides are losing. The only way for Putin to turn this around into a win would be total conquest of Ukraine, but it's impossible. Even if he succeeds militarily, he cannot occupy a land that hates him so freakin much long term.

Making them pay their contractually obligated share towards NATO rather than leaving the entire burden of their own defense to America. Also addresses the idiocy of Germany depending on Russia. 

&gt;This was known since 2014.

But nobody seemed to talk about it enough. Few people were willing to get in their face and slap some sense into them. 


&gt;KJU didn't gave up his nuclear program

But we got further than we ever had before with him.

 Admittedly, having a deterrent to invasion makes sense for a nation in their position. (Though they could try to stop sucking, but if people did we wouldn't have need for politics to begin with.) Point being that it's like asking a guy for one of his arms.

No it is not a joke that I'm ""stuck"" on a genocide that is being funded by the US government.

I'm stuck on what I have influence over, and where my tax money goes. Since it isn't going to build the bombs killing Ukrainians, I do get stuck on the people of Yemen and Palestine that they kill. 

I can't look at other fucking countries as long as we are doing the same thing. Maybe if we really cared about the Ukrainians, we'd take a long hard look at ourselves first and clean our own house of the things we are stuck with defending that are indefensible.

That said, does anything besides the TITLE applied to the Telegraph posted Youtube video indicate that this was a RUSSIAN vehicle that ran him over **on purpose**? His translated testimony says ""they"" did so-and-so.  Who's ""they""? Nothing you've shown in inconsistent with an unfortunate accident by Ukrainian forces IN KYIV just HOURS after a Russian invasion began. 

On the other hand, why didn't OTHER Ukrainian military forces in the immediate vicinity fire at this ""Russian"" anti-air vehicle (which came from where? The sky?) that's randomly attempting to run over civilians? How did ONE random unmarked (no ""Z"") anti-air tank drive unaccompanied all the way to Kyiv within hours of the invasion, and intentionally run over one random old man, and then drive off?  

Look, Putin's a psycho and this war is a travesty. That's clear from the evidence.  I'm not defending Russia's invasion at all. But there's no sensible explanation for this particular collision that accounts for ALL the relevant facts besides that it was an accident.  Admitting that does *nothing* to diminish Russia's culpability in this atrocious invasion.

Sometimes a few clickbait headline writers living 1000 miles away get the facts wrong; it happens (NY Post had the same mistaken headline). Sometimes an old guy on a bed hopped up on adrenaline and morphine gets the facts wrong (though, in his defense it's hard to see from the translated testimony who he means by ""they"" or how he'd know the difference under the circumstances).",66a125aa0a260a1039479ec69d0a8394e4f5652a,True,False,,,,,0,1647660778,,0,{},i18oro2,False,t3_thebwl,False,True,t1_i18fznk,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/thebwl/some_stats_for_today_18th_of_march/i18oro2/,1647660791,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647631978.0,,,,

I disagree that the USA has acknowledged our past. We are repeating our past in allowing and enabling the genocide of Semitic peoples under the banner of Zionism. 

We are actively supporting ethnic cleansing around the globe. So we aren't actually making sure it never happens again. We are just working to make sure it doesn't happen to the group of people it happened to in the 1940s again. 

It is my opinion that the horrors of genocide that we are witnessing in Ukraine cannot be denounced by those who are also enabling the exact same horrors elsewhere. Pushing the conversation of the exposure of your own hypocrisy or treating genocides of Ukrainians and genocides of Palestinians as apples and oranges is just furthering the same agenda that is currently killing the Ukrainians.

He came and sat down with some of us right in the middle of a conversation about how a former intelligence agent on podcast 2 years ago had described Russia's ""new modern military""  as way over blown. That the 4/5ths of the military was made up of old equipment which was very poorly maintained, the troops were often poorly trained and they didn't even have proper MRE's. That fuel could be scarce and funds very poorly distributed. 

We asked our veteran friend to weight in. ""I'll put it this way"" he said. ""My veteran friends and I have had a joke latley: ""When I was still in the Armed Forces we were told 10 rules to follow in order to ensure victory. The Russians have broke 37 of them."" 

He proceeded to explain how poorly equipped even Russia. Special forces are. Stating that last year he had ordered newer Russian MRE's (made in 2019) than what the soldiers have in Ukraine , plus a kevlar helmet and flak vest which he stated weren't army surplus but were sold by Russian military leaders on the side. He stated ""I'm have better Russian kit than nearly everyone in the field right now."" He also told us how Canadian Military intelligence had known for years of the inferior training, logistical challenges, and ""if you're weak appear strong"" ethos of the Russian Military as well. 

We wished him luck and told him to be safe to which he responded ""if I were you I'd be much more worried about the guys on the other end of my rifle."" 

Take it for what it is. He's my primary source and a very matter of fact guy.
