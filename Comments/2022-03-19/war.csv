But they did that.... After toppling saddam they just did that.

&gt;The US and its allies just wanted a pro-Western leader

And that's what we call a puppet.

&gt; popular backing from the local populace (what we naively call 'democracy' - leaving aside the sinister pro-capitalist bias).

But the one they got wasn't even popular, people just accepted it.

&gt;They spent 20 years trying to set that up and couldn't. 

They spent 20 years and to fuck it up even more.... the lack of progress in Afghanistan for example can be attributed to the US simply not letting them grow.

&gt;they could have done what Russia did in Chechnya, Syria and Ukraine: bomb the place to fuck and hope the locals remain too cowed to fight back.

But US does that too..... Russia installed a dictator in Chechnya and so does the US in countries they invade or just do it from afar by supporting certain shady military figures to do coups

&gt;The allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan didn't do that. They tried to put the mechanisms in place for a functioning democratic country - and they didn't achieve it.  


They were trying put a mechanism for the nation to always have pro-westerns leaders.

I am not American and I agree the Gulf Wars of the early 00's were unwarranted, but the goal was never to occupy the region and set up a puppet regime (like Russia in Belarus and Ukraine).

The US and its allies just wanted a pro-Western leader with popular backing from the local populace (what we naively call 'democracy' - leaving aside the sinister pro-capitalist bias).

They spent 20 years trying to set that up and couldn't. If they wanted to just occupy / subdue the country they could have done what Russia did in Chechnya, Syria and Ukraine: bomb the place to fuck and hope the locals remain too cowed to fight back.

The allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan didn't do that. They tried to put the mechanisms in place for a functioning democratic country - and they didn't achieve it.

There were atrocities. There were civilian casualties. The whole invasion was predicated on known lies. All true. 

But it doesn't begin to resemble the situation where a nation simply invades its much smaller neighbour with no shadow of pretext, and seeks to usurp a democratically elected government and annex their territory.   That is just simple murder and theft.

It's unhelpful to draw parallels with things the US has done because a lot of people don't understand the nuances of it and there's a danger you'll lead people to make comparisons that really are not justified.",e28e9339983a5a3a2728245463caa3204999f350,True,False,,,,,0,1647730319,,0,{},i1c5vs2,False,t3_ti3aju,False,True,t1_i1c1ujd,/r/war/comments/ti3aju/tomorrow_is_the_anniversary_of_the_iraq_war_19/i1c5vs2/,1647730332,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647701519.0,,,,

That was backed by the US for a long time....

Lmao wtf are you even saying..... US wasn't there to overthrow a dictator, overthrowing the dictator was just the secondary task. Just like how Iraq was rich in Oil, Ukraine has newly discovered natural gas..... the difference is that the latter isn't the main short-term object of Russia.

&gt;You literally have zero evidence that the US hit and targeted civilian buildings

&gt;Good guys? I’m not sure about that. Better than Russia? Oh fuck yes

If that's your bar then you're setting it really low. I'm not gonna argue which is better because both suck ass.

&gt;Millions of civilians died at the hands of fellow Iraqis during the civil war

Which was indirectly caused by US destabilizing the shit out of the country.

&gt;not at the hands of Americans during the invasion. If you actually educated yourself you would know this

US and people they support killed more than in Iraq than any of the other sides.

&gt;I also don’t support the invasion.  I’m fine that we disposed a murderous dictator who tries to genocide Kurds

And I'm fine with that too. You think we liked Saddam? you think this post is defending Saddam? Saddam was literally the Americans puppet until he made a wrong move and they decided he had to go.

&gt;who invaded two neighboring countries.

Lmao, he was given arms in the war with Iran by the US. And in Kuwait US ambassador to Iraq at the time gave Saddam the green light to invade. see : ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie#Meetings_with_Saddam_Hussein), [2](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/09/wikileaks-april-glaspie-and-saddam-hussein/))

Bla Bla Bla. Reality can be a bitch. You might have been right about everything until day 3 of the invasion. Until then, even a stupid russian, should have understood what is going on. Now you have two options. Just go with it and try to make it out alive somehow while killing innocent people or find a way to surrender asap and hope for the best knowing you will never have to go to Russia again. 

Everything else is just Russian-Friendly Propaganda. 

Also remember that there was no complains for Invading Donbass and Crimea in Russia or by Russians whatsoever. So no Russian is innocent to me. 

They need to be shamed wherever and whenever. That is the LEAST we can do compared to what their government and their army is doing to Ukraine and its people. 

So whenever you feel the need to excuse any russian for what is going on, just think of the blood that was already on their hands 8 years ago.

US has the ability to do precision strikes, but they do it to target places with civilian populations.

,[],False,,OFRobertin,,,[],,,,text,t2_175lyt,False,False,"That's very true, Russia managed to start the death of the us dollar as the world reserve currency, it was planned, and they did it perfectly. When the US decided to block Russia's access to the SWIFT network(which is used for the execution of financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide, and it uses the USD), and this was a very dumb move from the US, since now the dollar has been weaponized, and that's not good for the ""World reserve currency"", where the US has the power to block you from your own money, if you are deemed an enemy.   
What country would keep their monetary energy in a currency, not to mention how inflation is sky high all over the world and the US dollar was supposed to be the , meanwhile the World's reserve currency is being printed like it's just a piece of paper, or not even that, nowadays, the printing is happening through technology, and thus, can be done in a much larger scale, instead of just printing more paper money, the US has no exit to this situation and that's because the US national debt is above what the country is worth, in 2021 it was around 130% the GDP, and that's a recipe for a default(when you can't pay your due debt, like what's happening in Russia, but they have the resources to pay, just that they can't send money thorough banks, and thus aren't able to pay), and what that means to the US, is that they are obligated to print more USD, devaluing their own money even more, spiraling down to the value of the paper itself, like in Venezuela, where the currency has devalued so much, that people are making purses and other things out of the money, since there is more value then. All of this was accentuated by the Russian invasion, since the USD has been weaponized and also printed more than the bible, and that's the reason why the M1, aka money suply, has gone up 500% since march 2020(covid crash) and that means that around 80% of the USD in circulation, was printed in the last 2 years, other countries are selling their US treasuries which was supposed to be the ultimate savings tool for governments, since 1971, when Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar to gold, and thus creating the FIAT system.  


Which then made and Russia and China have been doing this since 2014, they've been buying lots and lots of gold, and that's when Russia took Crimea (The reason seems to be that Crimea has 80% of the total OIL in Ukraine, and that would give competition for the Russian oil), thus kicking off the Ukrainian invasion, though they waited a couple years for the real deal, and that's why they did it now, that's when the global economy is the weakest since the 2008 housing bubble, they knew that if they struck now, the US fed would have no other choice other than to print more money.   


When the fed mentioned about raising rates (that means that the economy will suffer) way back in September, Every US market dropped like it's hot and went basically into a bear market, that is, dropped more than 20% from All time high, which was caused in the first place because of inflation, print more money, value of stocks goes up, aka quantitative easing, that shows how weak the economy is. This week, the federal reserve's chairmen raised interest rates, finally, US CPI(cooked price index) is almost above 8%, and what does the FED chairmen do? raises it by the literal minimum amount and that's because of Russia's actions, if they raised more, the economy would suffer way too much and what the fed said, was that he would raise interest rates on the FOMC meetings that they have every so often, they had one this week, and then their next one is in may, then june, and basically what the said fed is that he will raise interests once per meeting and that mean that they are being very predictable, and that is what the markets like, they hate suprises, yet, the markets are still down quite a bit, and that's because once you raise interests, that causes investors to go to risk off assets, meaning that tech stocks, and riskyish business suffer, and that's why  and that means that the US economy is suffering like never before, and that's why they are rekt, and when he finally hiked rates, he did the bare minimum, 0.25, this happened this week, and that rallied the markets because he basically said that he will be raising rates until something breaks. Aka a recession. And that's why the dollar is about to die. sowey for the text wall...",6ffb7e0c37c6cd256f30bb526b234bb9310d8ac4,True,False,,,,,0,1647665232,,0,{},i18whex,True,t3_thhk2n,False,True,t1_i18brxg,/r/war/comments/thhk2n/what_happens_with_the_sanctions_if_russia_ceases/i18whex/,1647665250,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647636432.0,,,,

Sanctions are fair game when you deal with rouge fascists like Russia, and I don't see a problem with that, or that China is scared of being treated like a paria for the future.

The fact that Russia can trade with China through that marginal system is in fact a good thing, because it will make Russia Chinas puppet and more or less only trading partner. Everyone else will probably choose the west, like China does. I don't think Russia will want to live with sanctions and go through China for ever, It just won't get things back to normal. 

The hit the west has chosen to take is manageable, and it will not cause a recession, because the world continues without Russia, and nobody else want what Russia gets.

For every Russian soldier that has killed civilians in cold blood there are many whom surrendered some never firing a single shot. In Odessa 600 marines refused to disembark their ships choosing to riot instead of fighting according to Russian POW testaments. Many conscripts apparently deserted after crossing the border or surrendering within the first few hours. 


Same as back home in Russia. They say putins approval rating is 75% but do we really believe that in a country where all media is controlled by the state now?  

Before the war there was already a huge growing animosity amongst the general Russian people a tens of thousands now are being arrested and brutalised on the streets and in police stations across Russia to protest the war. 

It is sort of like a Hitler Germany situation. Its easy to say all Germans were nazis between the period of 1938 and 1945 but that is also an over simplification. The ones in charge were obviously guilty but there were many whom did not agree and did resist. Many whom never lived to see the end of the war. 


Propaganda on both sides are aiming to dehumanise the enemy as is always the case in war. Humans can't just start shooting each other its hard wired into our brains to find that kind of thing abhorrent and unnatural. That is why Propaganda often depicts a broad and vile image of the enemy to galvanise people into action. 

Of course Ukrainians didn't need much convincing to shoot back after missile strikes swept the country in the opening hours of the war. Putins own war machine was better Propaganda than anything the Ukrainians could come up with. But Russia depicts ukraine as a failed nazi state and a puppet of NATO who are also secretly nazis etc... and though yes groups like azov the extremist pro neo nazi group they are tiny in comparison to the main military and even smaller still to the whole of Ukraine. 


War makes good men into monsters in order to justify monstrous and inhuman acts against one another. And as long as the war continues that will only continue to become more apparent and the circumstances will become even more abhorrent. Its a snowballing effect that will eventually lead to full on genocide if we're not careful. 


Do not lose that which makes you, you.

,[],False,,OFRobertin,,,[],,,,text,t2_175lyt,False,False,"yea, ofc most sanctions are just a showoff for people to think that governments are doing something, meanwhile they are buying gas and oil like no tomorrow. But what about  the real sanctions, for example, the swift ban, that is a really big deal, not only for Russia, but for every country out there that uses it, since now, the dollar has been weaponized by the US, and they tried to block money itself, and thus the trust in the ponzi, and how can any rational person keep their monetary energy in the money controlled by a single country that has shown it's willingness to block money itself, if you are considered an enemy of the west, or even if you are in the west itself. What can Russia do now? Use the Chinese version of swift, which barely anyone uses? and what does that solve? you just shifted the Government that you have to trust. Saudi Arabia has already shown interest in selling oil for the Chinese Yuan, and what can the US do about it? Invade them again? I don't think so, the US would be insane to start another war, in the current situation, Russia has grabbed the US by the balls, and twisted it, and that looks to me like the death of the dollar, just look at the CPI (cooked price index), it's already insanely high, and those are the ""oficial numbers"" meanwhile gas is above 50% price since 2021 (Don't quote me on that), And that's a recipe for another recession, and then the fed decides to raise rates finally, after we get cpi above 7.9, and him just mentioning that he will raise rates caused the markets to panic sell, and instantly go into a bear market, and he had just mentioned the rate hike. The US economy is cucked, and they did that themselves, and with everything happening across the world, it only points downwards, what can the US do? they owe more debt than the whole country is worth, it's a vicious cycle, they have to print more money, and that's the world reserve currency we are talking about, the euro is even worse than this, and they just said  that they won't be raising rates, at least they were honest about it. What can anyone do? Gold maybe? like Russia has been buying, and selling US treasuries. However, if you look at gold's price, adjusted for inflation, it's quite useless as a hedge, and it goes down with everything else in a recession, and what else can you buy? The answer is quite obvious tbh, a currency that is everywhere around the world, and where no one controls the monetary policy, and is censorship resistant, and seizure resistant, and the only kind of property that you could store literally in your head(thought that's a recipe for a brain injury away to lose it all). Russia has shown interest on it, thought I don't think they will adopt it right away, or even announce before they buy it, and that's almost a race for the gold which has a very strict maximum number, and thus invaluable compared to the FIAT system which is printed constantly and has no limits, it's just like the denominator of a division, 21M/infinity.",86020438e6bae941cdc004f8bc0091e6e7a0bc46,True,False,,,,,0,1647653652,,0,{},i18awrv,True,t3_thhk2n,False,True,t1_i1860t0,/r/war/comments/thhk2n/what_happens_with_the_sanctions_if_russia_ceases/i18awrv/,1647653663,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647624852.0,,,,

Gas is a short term issue but Europe is set on getting rid of the dependency on Russia, so that is manageable with the help of Norway and LNG imports from the rest of the world. 

Minerals are a bit different, because Europe would have to open up mines and create new ones to get the minerals, which might be a good thing anyway. The Russians need to sell their shit to survive, and minerals going to China, and then  out to the rest of the world is likely, because Russia needs money to survive and keep a small army.

The rest of the sanctions is laughable, and sanctioning politicians that don't have any assets in Russia and have no desire going there is just dumb.
