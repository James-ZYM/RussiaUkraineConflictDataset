When the US decided to block Russia's access to the SWIFT network(which is used for the execution of financial transactions and payments between banks worldwide, and it uses the USD), and this was a very dumb move from the US, since now the dollar has been weaponized, and that's not good for the ""World reserve currency"", where the US has the power to block you from your own money, if you are deemed an enemy.   
What country would keep their monetary energy in a currency, not to mention how inflation is sky high all over the world and the US dollar was supposed to be the , meanwhile the World's reserve currency is being printed like it's just a piece of paper, or not even that, nowadays, the printing is happening through technology, and thus, can be done in a much larger scale, instead of just printing more paper money, the US has no exit to this situation and that's because the US national debt is above what the country is worth, in 2021 it was around 130% the GDP, and that's a recipe for a default(when you can't pay your due debt, like what's happening in Russia, but they have the resources to pay, just that they can't send money thorough banks, and thus aren't able to pay), and what that means to the US, is that they are obligated to print more USD, devaluing their own money even more, spiraling down to the value of the paper itself, like in Venezuela, where the currency has devalued so much, that people are making purses and other things out of the money, since there is more value then. All of this was accentuated by the Russian invasion, since the USD has been weaponized and also printed more than the bible, and that's the reason why the M1, aka money suply, has gone up 500% since march 2020(covid crash) and that means that around 80% of the USD in circulation, was printed in the last 2 years, other countries are selling their US treasuries which was supposed to be the ultimate savings tool for governments, since 1971, when Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar to gold, and thus creating the FIAT system.  


Which then made and Russia and China have been doing this since 2014, they've been buying lots and lots of gold, and that's when Russia took Crimea (The reason seems to be that Crimea has 80% of the total OIL in Ukraine, and that would give competition for the Russian oil), thus kicking off the Ukrainian invasion, though they waited a couple years for the real deal, and that's why they did it now, that's when the global economy is the weakest since the 2008 housing bubble, they knew that if they struck now, the US fed would have no other choice other than to print more money.   


When the fed mentioned about raising rates (that means that the economy will suffer) way back in September, Every US market dropped like it's hot and went basically into a bear market, that is, dropped more than 20% from All time high, which was caused in the first place because of inflation, print more money, value of stocks goes up, aka quantitative easing, that shows how weak the economy is. This week, the federal reserve's chairmen raised interest rates, finally, US CPI(cooked price index) is almost above 8%, and what does the FED chairmen do? raises it by the literal minimum amount and that's because of Russia's actions, if they raised more, the economy would suffer way too much and what the fed said, was that he would raise interest rates on the FOMC meetings that they have every so often, they had one this week, and then their next one is in may, then june, and basically what the said fed is that he will raise interests once per meeting and that mean that they are being very predictable, and that is what the markets like, they hate suprises, yet, the markets are still down quite a bit, and that's because once you raise interests, that causes investors to go to risk off assets, meaning that tech stocks, and riskyish business suffer, and that's why  and that means that the US economy is suffering like never before, and that's why they are rekt, and when he finally hiked rates, he did the bare minimum, 0.25, this happened this week, and that rallied the markets because he basically said that he will be raising rates until something breaks. Aka a recession. And that's why the dollar is about to die. sowey for the text wall...",6ffb7e0c37c6cd256f30bb526b234bb9310d8ac4,True,False,,,,,0,1647665232,,0,{},i18whex,True,t3_thhk2n,False,True,t1_i18brxg,/r/war/comments/thhk2n/what_happens_with_the_sanctions_if_russia_ceases/i18whex/,1647665250,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647636432.0,

Sanctions are fair game when you deal with rouge fascists like Russia, and I don't see a problem with that, or that China is scared of being treated like a paria for the future.

The fact that Russia can trade with China through that marginal system is in fact a good thing, because it will make Russia Chinas puppet and more or less only trading partner. Everyone else will probably choose the west, like China does. I don't think Russia will want to live with sanctions and go through China for ever, It just won't get things back to normal. 

The hit the west has chosen to take is manageable, and it will not cause a recession, because the world continues without Russia, and nobody else want what Russia gets.

For every Russian soldier that has killed civilians in cold blood there are many whom surrendered some never firing a single shot. In Odessa 600 marines refused to disembark their ships choosing to riot instead of fighting according to Russian POW testaments. Many conscripts apparently deserted after crossing the border or surrendering within the first few hours. 


Same as back home in Russia. They say putins approval rating is 75% but do we really believe that in a country where all media is controlled by the state now?  

Before the war there was already a huge growing animosity amongst the general Russian people a tens of thousands now are being arrested and brutalised on the streets and in police stations across Russia to protest the war. 

It is sort of like a Hitler Germany situation. Its easy to say all Germans were nazis between the period of 1938 and 1945 but that is also an over simplification. The ones in charge were obviously guilty but there were many whom did not agree and did resist. Many whom never lived to see the end of the war. 


Propaganda on both sides are aiming to dehumanise the enemy as is always the case in war. Humans can't just start shooting each other its hard wired into our brains to find that kind of thing abhorrent and unnatural. That is why Propaganda often depicts a broad and vile image of the enemy to galvanise people into action. 

Of course Ukrainians didn't need much convincing to shoot back after missile strikes swept the country in the opening hours of the war. Putins own war machine was better Propaganda than anything the Ukrainians could come up with. But Russia depicts ukraine as a failed nazi state and a puppet of NATO who are also secretly nazis etc... and though yes groups like azov the extremist pro neo nazi group they are tiny in comparison to the main military and even smaller still to the whole of Ukraine. 


War makes good men into monsters in order to justify monstrous and inhuman acts against one another. And as long as the war continues that will only continue to become more apparent and the circumstances will become even more abhorrent.

But what about  the real sanctions, for example, the swift ban, that is a really big deal, not only for Russia, but for every country out there that uses it, since now, the dollar has been weaponized by the US, and they tried to block money itself, and thus the trust in the ponzi, and how can any rational person keep their monetary energy in the money controlled by a single country that has shown it's willingness to block money itself, if you are considered an enemy of the west, or even if you are in the west itself. What can Russia do now? Use the Chinese version of swift, which barely anyone uses? and what does that solve? you just shifted the Government that you have to trust. Saudi Arabia has already shown interest in selling oil for the Chinese Yuan, and what can the US do about it? Invade them again? I don't think so, the US would be insane to start another war, in the current situation, Russia has grabbed the US by the balls, and twisted it, and that looks to me like the death of the dollar, just look at the CPI (cooked price index), it's already insanely high, and those are the ""oficial numbers"" meanwhile gas is above 50% price since 2021 (Don't quote me on that), And that's a recipe for another recession, and then the fed decides to raise rates finally, after we get cpi above 7.9, and him just mentioning that he will raise rates caused the markets to panic sell, and instantly go into a bear market, and he had just mentioned the rate hike. The US economy is cucked, and they did that themselves, and with everything happening across the world, it only points downwards, what can the US do? they owe more debt than the whole country is worth, it's a vicious cycle, they have to print more money, and that's the world reserve currency we are talking about, the euro is even worse than this, and they just said  that they won't be raising rates, at least they were honest about it. What can anyone do? Gold maybe? like Russia has been buying, and selling US treasuries. However, if you look at gold's price, adjusted for inflation, it's quite useless as a hedge, and it goes down with everything else in a recession, and what else can you buy? The answer is quite obvious tbh, a currency that is everywhere around the world, and where no one controls the monetary policy, and is censorship resistant, and seizure resistant, and the only kind of property that you could store literally in your head(thought that's a recipe for a brain injury away to lose it all). Russia has shown interest on it, thought I don't think they will adopt it right away, or even announce before they buy it, and that's almost a race for the gold which has a very strict maximum number, and thus invaluable compared to the FIAT system which is printed constantly and has no limits, it's just like the denominator of a division, 21M/infinity.",86020438e6bae941cdc004f8bc0091e6e7a0bc46,True,False,,,,,0,1647653652,,0,{},i18awrv,True,t3_thhk2n,False,True,t1_i1860t0,/r/war/comments/thhk2n/what_happens_with_the_sanctions_if_russia_ceases/i18awrv/,1647653663,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647624852.0,

NATO has been surrounding Russia for 2 decades now, up east to Georgia. Yeltsin was too weak and drunk to do anything, Putin is a very different guy.

It’s not happening.

Ukraine is acting desperately and ruthlessly, impeding the evacuation of civilians whilst the Russians are doing all they can to spare them. They want a lot of civilians to die in order to provoke the West to an escalation. They are, also, one of the most corrupted Countries on earth.

They can't even get air support and their air force is literally incapable of large scale operations. You know, the kinda shit you need BEFORE a ground invasion? 




&amp;nbsp;


&gt; I however, do not believe the numbers being given by the Ukrianians or Americans for that matter because A: Ukriane is spreading propaganda in hopes of giving faith somehow B: Trusting the US lol, sounds like a joke

Yea I already explained why in this instance, US intelligence is a good source. Russia being unstoppable would literally help us in this fight. So if we were going to lie about anything, we would be making Russia into a bigger enemy than they are. That is the motive for US intelligence when they do lie. 



&amp;nbsp;




&gt;by justifying that Russia committed war crimes too lol.

No, that isn't what I was doing at all. I merely pointed out that Russia has an invalid reason for this invasion. War crimes are not shit Russia cares about in the slightest. You can't bring up Ukraine doing this or that, when Russia is significantly worse by EVERY fucking metric. 



&amp;nbsp;




&gt;It's like saying, well I slapped you, but you slapped me too so let's just forget who was at fault. 

Definitely one of the dumbest things you have said thus far, and that is saying something my friend. 



&gt; We both are and just saying Russia committed war crimes doesn't actually equate or dismiss the bad shit Ukriane did too

I am not in the wrong at all. Keep me out of your bullshit. What you don't seem to realize is the fact that Russia did war crimes, means they can't complain about Ukraine doing them, and then invade. The deaths in this fight are also largely not from infantry combat. So this idea that Zelensky got people killed because he gave them guns is bullshit. Russia is killing people with missiles, rockets, and artillery.",438347bf72b0cd32ac0a2d22a50d1788580fe3f1,True,True,,,,,0,1647625228,,0,{},i16gxxe,False,t3_tgberp,False,True,t1_i16f1z8,/r/war/comments/tgberp/footage_of_the_russian_military_using/i16gxxe/,1647625242,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647596428.0,

If you take in count that it is the 21st century and humanity should already be in a state where war with itself is a crime and should be punished by all nations of the world yet here we are having war with ourselves and governments (like Viktor Orbán) says ""we should not take actions against Putin because it is not our war"" then Russia already won. This is not just for the territory they want. They want to show the world that attacking other nations is still an option to show your dominance.

If you go wild with the idea that Hitler nearly had the same tactics as putin now and the west reacted the same way as now (except it was way slower with Hitler) then again It could be possible that this is just the start of a much larger, worse war. Let's hope this is not the case.

My hope right now is that russian military and civils will say no at some point because of the actions of Anonymous hack group (It is amazing what they did and it is a huge game changer) and they will remove Putin from the power.

No it isn't. US intelligence has clearly been able to completely monitor Russia and everything they are doing. This is why we knew the invasion was coming, and Russia backed down for a week or so before actually invading. 


So we actually have US intelligence that says it isn't going well for Russia. If we wanted to make the war a bigger issue around the world, we would definitely not be talking about how fucked up Russia is getting from this conflict, we would lie and say the opposite.

1: Putin is a PIECE of shit for invading Ukriane, if he wanted Ukraine to not join nato, he made his point. Ukriane itself told it's no longer interested for nato membership and now would have been the time to withdraw forces but he didn't

2: Zelensky is a piece of shit for involving civilians in this war. Instead of focusing on evacuating the citizens, he's armed the city of kiev which unfortunately will cause a lot more casualties. Not only kiev but he's motivated people to fight outside kiev too and now they're dying, when instead the plans for evacuations and minimising civilian casualties should have begun a long long time ago. 

3: I clearly admitted that invasion of Ukriane was solely based on the fact that putin wants Ukriane under his belt, I don't even know why we're talking about that when I've admitted countless time that neo nazism isn't even a reason to invade

4: Im too lazy to give you the source and look for the video in this forum. By giving you multiple sources of atrocities committed by azov and Ukrianian military of violation of human rights, I think I've established certain rapport for being truthful to my claims, therefore I won't waste countless manhours looking for the video while I clearly know it's on this subreddit. You should look for it yourself because it DOES exist. Believe me or not I don't care

5: Ramzan is a piece of shit I don't even care about him

6: I know Putin doesn't care about human rights, however hypocritical West's claim of calling Putin a war criminal may be, this is a part of Putin legacy which he has tarnished forever. Yes people have been killed and I've always called out Russia on the fact that they bombed hospitals and innocent civilians who were affected by collateral. I have even talked to a Ukrianian here on this exact subreddit forwarding my condolences and regret of this war. Apart from that I don't think I need to further justify myself and my stance on this war. My stance is that both sides have committed their share of mistakes, Although Russia has unarguably done more share of their atrocities, but the fact remains that both of them have their own blames. That's the main thing I always advocated for. The fact that my defense for Russians is more apparent, it's only because there are more pro Ukrianian people here who spread propaganda, and my share of criticsm goes to counter that. That's why you are mistaken that somehow I'm defending the Russians more. 

In conclusion: All my history of criticising Ukrianian goverment was for the reason of their support for Azov and giving civilians weapons and motivation to fight, therefore involving them directly in this conflict. They involved the foreign legion in this war, the war whose result we already know (Russia will win, Ukriane doens't have the backing of NATO or EU for that matter) so why even try to include citizens when you know you're gonna lose. Just avoid the bloodshed. That's all I've ever criticised the Ukrianian goverment for. People are dying on both sides and by my history it's clear that I advocate for human rights because I value the life that's being wasted on both the sides. Apart from that believe whatever you will. This was my last reply to you because im just done and it's pathetic to justify myself again and again that I care about the Ukrianians. I can't anymore.
