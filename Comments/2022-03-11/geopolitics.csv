[],False,,prettyketty88,,,,,,"&gt; MAD is a type of game theory. 

you arent using the word game theory correctly... mathematical game theory is the study of how games are played and how actors behave in strategic situations

A military ""doctrine"" has nothing to do with game theory. Sure its an attempt at opponent behavior prediction, but as i already pointed out, one that makes many assumptions.

&gt;If you have to reach for hypothetical scenarios that even you admit aren’t realistic to outline a scenario where your argument holds water, then you might want to reevaluate your position and rethink your Freshman 101 view of the world.

why are you being so hostile, you are the one that doesnt even know what game theory is and you are arguing. It was an example of how there could be information that you arent aware of. The fact that it was a ""hypothetical"" does not negate the point that there could potentially be (an unlimited) number of possibilities you aren't aware of. In fact, real world strategic situations are so complicated, thinking that you have found the solution to the game of nuclear warfare, when the best artificial intelligence cant even solve the game of chess, is very naive.

&gt;Your argument about suicide by blaze of glory fails on its face as Vova has and has had plenty of opportunities to do so already with an endless variety of weapons.

 i didnt say he is likely suicidal. I said ""bad strategy to assume"". it was yet again simply a way to prove the point that MAD predictions are based on the assumptions that both people who are in charge want to live, and value the future of the planet. MAD is the same thing as saying no one is going to rob you or hurt you because they will go to jail. Some people believe that they will never be murdered because the person will go to prison, people get murdered all the time. Super naive to walk around thinking that. You are saying foreign policy should be designed around the assumption that the enemy will never attack under any circumstances.

""enemy never attack cuz we have big bomb""  you are such a genius/s

completely ignored my last point about how defensive weapons that shoot nukes out of the sky are now deployed. This entirely changes the game, and you seem to have acknowledged that. You also proved your ignorance of how technology has changed since MAD first was spoken of. You keep saying, ""its been kept simple"". that doesnt prove anything. I entirely agree with you its simple, its dramatically oversimplified for how complicated the world is and the simple fact that there are an essentially countless number of possibilities.

&gt;is like designing your foreign policy based on the slim possibility that all Russians are secretly unicorn-riding leprechauns in disguise. It’s neither a good idea, nor is it realistic.

you shouldnt design your foreign policy on any assumptions. There are different ways to choose moves, but typically the best response is the one that works regardless of what your opponent does. This is because of how hard it is to predict behavior.

&gt;what’s going to benefit America, not what’s going to soothe your irrational fears.

my peer, we both want to benefit america, dont give me that nonsense that i do not want whats best for myself and home just because we disagree about MAD.

on soothing irrational fears... im the one arguing that nuclear war is possible, you are the one arguing it is impossible. if anyone is trying to soothe themselves with dogmatic teachings (what a doctrine is) thats you. don't answer me without addressing this point.

The missiles in Khazakstan were non-operational ICBMs that could have been prepared at the Tyuratam (Baikonur) Cosmodrome in case of an emergency.

The ICBMs remained under the firm control of the Soviet Rocket Forces. These troops had been ordered to prevent any unauthorized entry into their base.  
  
At the same time, a plan was devised to take out the ICBMs should the ROcket Bases were about to fall into Byelorussian or Ukraine hands. The troops would have opened the silo doors allowing aircraft to bomb the missiles inside.  
  
This would have effectively destroyed the ICBMs and created a radiological mess.  
  
Byelorussia complied to give up the missiles, Ukraine was making life difficult.  
  
So an unofficial liaison mission from Russia and NATO was sent to Kiev.

Europe is taking the brunt of war and not only because of the increased energy costs and the costs associated to the influx of refugees but also from things like mentioned in one of the links I posted: 

&gt;Finland is by far the main exporting country to Russia when it comes to paper and board, representing 54% of all EU exports to this country. 

People are always referring to Russia's invasion to Finland and the security implications, but the truth is that Finnish paper and board producers are probably taking a big hit at the moment, which sucks of course for them. In the end, I have framed the analysis within the idea that we should evaluate the costs of war systemically 

So I was being a bit facetious when I brought up Disney and Adidas, they aren't even the most affected sectors within perhaps one of the less affected parties. 

My point was that I've seen people trying to gauge the cost to Russia's economy from companies leaving the country i.e. 80 McDonald's stores are closing down or GM is not going to sell cars to the Russian market, etc. While this has an impact, the tit-for-tat export restrictions from Russia will probably have a much larger impact in the short term since such commodities directly affect the lower rung of the hierarchy of needs.

So generally, fertilizer uses 3 major components: potash, phosphorous, and nitrogen. 

Morocco produces the overwhelming majority of phosphorous that is used for fertilizer. Nitrogen can come from anywhere.

Potash, the 3rd ingredient, is what is found in Russia and Belarus. Canada is actually the largest producer, producing about as much as Russia and Belarus combined (who are the #2 and #3 producers). China and Germany also produce some amount of potash, and there are a few other countries with small production volumes, but Canada, Russia, and Belarus produce around 70% of global potash.

China openly stating that it intends to ""reunify"" with Taiwan allows them to strongly pressure any other nation to prevent recognition of Taiwan in even very small ways. For instance were China to be more unclear about their intention I doubt the WHO would be willing to publicly embarrass themselves to avoid talking about Taiwan. WHO does that because China's position is openly stated and there is no room for interpretation.

Russia has stated that they are willing to use whatever force necessary  to beat Ukraine. This has cowed less confident members of their opposition. For example Poland trying to form complicated schemes to give jets to Ukraine instead of just flying them over or shipping them directly.

So why would the US state in no uncertain terms that it will not intervene? It removes the ambiguity surrounding US intentions in the region.

I do agree, but I think we are seeing a scorched-earth moment in this conflict from both parties. The West is having a massive loss in investor confidence too as I wrote in another post:

First, Russia's recent moves have made it fundamentally unattractive to most Western investors short- and medium-term. Tricks like nationalising foreign assets only work once, and the price you pay for them is massive loss in investor confidence. This is even true (albeit to a lesser extent) for 'friendly' countries like China: if the Russian government has indicated willingness to flout norms of ownership, then that adds significant risk to any investment decisions, which will be expensive to hedge.  
  
Second, don't underestimate how severely Russia's tech sector in particular will be hit by everything that's happened. Progress in tech is heavily reliant on attracting high-skilled personnel and generating the right kind of start up/investment ecosystems. Russia was already lagging in these domains and is now in deep trouble. Why would a smart talented coder from e.g. India or Vietnam go to work in Russia and be paid in rubles when they could get a job in San Francisco or London? Why would non-Russian investors take risks on throwing money Russian startups when the international situation could change so quickly?

Well I'm from Portugal so maybe I can give some insight from here although the countries in Southern Europe seem to have VASTLY different concerns when it comes to this conflict. 

Portugal and Spain at least seem very comfortable to just 100% support Ukraine since Russia can't really pressure us in any way. Our oil and gas don't come from Russia and we are way too far away to be concerned in terms of military security. We are honestly more concerned on getting some EU funds to help our economies post-Covid by towing the line than anything else.

Italy seems to be more cautious given their higher dependence on Russian energetic resources and warmer relations with Russia as a whole (although I'm not too informed on specifics in their position). Meanwhile, in Greece we have the ""Turkey variable"" to consider, that will have to take into account how Turkey ends up at the end of the conflict.

I doubt Kruschev truly intended to use Cuba as a base to first strike the US, but the US leadership perceived that the possibility was unacceptable to their strategic interests (that and the Monroe Doctrine), and was willing to start a nuclear war to prevent that possibility. 

It is in Russia's strategic interest to prevent Ukraine from falling into a foreign military alliance. It is also in Russia's strategic interest to prevent Ukraine from challenging their gas monopoly in Europe (they discovered large natural gas reserves in 2010 and a Ukraine integrated with Europe is a dangerous threat to Russia's most important bargaining chip with the West. There is also an argument to be made that it is in Russia's strategic interest to define a clear consequence for breaking free of it's orbit.

That is not even remotely true. A nation-state is constrained by several factors, the least of which is nuclear weapons. This idea Putin is going to conquer the whole of Europe is farcical and media-driven. He can't do that. He doesn't have the resources to do so. This is not WW2 and I am tired of seeing the allusions to Hitler. I'm tired of seeing ""imperialism"" used as a sneer word.

Russia isn't even close to an empire. In order to be an imperial power, according to most political definitions of the word (I'm going to use world-systems theory), you need to export capital and have control over the major systems of trade. Russia does not fit in either of those categories. It's a semi-peripheral state. It does not have the resources to conquer all of eastern Europe, nukes don't change that equation. Let's stop fear-mongering already.

This article quotes Victoria Nuland regarding US LNG interests wrt Germany and Nord Stream 2. It's from Jan 27th so I would assume most things were set in stone regarding military action from Russia, but it's interesting to hear her so upfront about it. (also interesting to note considering her role in the 2014 coup)

(Sidebar while on the topic of Euromaidan, Medvedchuk also talked in depth about the sniper's who really kicked off the chaos - and something interesting to note about that was the number of deaths. IIRC, he claims a US correspondence stated they would not get involved unless the death toll hit 100, and then makes the claim that the exact death toll of this event was 100. Most promising leads come from an external Forensics expert in Ottawa who believes the shots came from protestor held buildings, not police/army, and also compiled video footage and found 2 men to be leading a group of people to the exact spot of the massacre, in view of the building windows previously mentioned. Big claims from Medvedchuk but you're free to evaluate for yourself)

Wrt to the energy market, IIRC Hunter Biden is on the board of directors of some oil company in Ukraine. I remember a documentary in which Viktor Medvekchuk talked about Ukraine being a resource rich land, and the oil and gas potentials are largely untapped as instability in the region has discouraged big investment for oil to be produced. Nothing concrete there but if you wanted to go digging further it could be interesting to learn why the son of the guy who helped orchestrate this conflict (knowing the cause and effect line since 1997) is linked to a company who would stand to profit big in the case of stability.

&gt;*Crimea:*   Russia seeks agreement that it has the right to keep the 10,000 square mile peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.   Crimea is site of  the  Sevastopol naval base, which has a history on Crimea that far predates [Khrushchev ""giving"" Crimea to Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point) in 1954.

NATO was planning to admit Ukraine and Georgia (hence Russia's response to deny their sovereignty and territorial integrity).

Yet if you listen to Americans, Ukraine and especially Georgia are not core security interests to the US. Quite frankly no one West of Poland is all that interested in having security commitments to Ukraine.

But they were fine with enlargement, why?

Here's where we need to step away from ""realist"" geopolitics and understand the mentality of the West, especially the ""End of History"" West.

Western foreign policy has largely been liberal. Following the collapse of the USSR, the West no longer cared about geopolitical struggles or concerns basically at all. In their eyes liberalism had one. It would be capitalism and democracy forever now. Sure there were still authoritarian states, but they'd come around in time. With increasing global trade old conflicts would be made irrelevant and there would be peace and prosperity for all.

That is the _genuine_ optimistic outlook of the West on the future. You'll notice how NATO is also in principle about democracy, and that some states, such as Slovakia, were initially not accepted due to overly authoritarian governments. Thus even to join the West pressured countries to be more democratic.

Ukraine in NATO was never a security consideration, it was simply a way to help Ukraine westernise. But tying then into Western institutions like NATO and the EU, Ukraine would be all the more a proper liberal democracy.

This is also the rough time period when the West admitted Russia and China to the WTO, which shows again that same optimism and same hope for liberalisation through admitting countries into international institutions.

Thus even the West said they would allow Ukraine, it was not an anti-Russian move. It was about Western institutions. When the Americans said it's not against Russia and Putin need not be worried, they were absolutely serious, because one day they also wanted Russia to be a part of the West in the same way.

They also failed to understand Putin's concerns entirely, because at this time the West believed in a peaceful liberal world order. They did not understand or take seriously any geopolitical concerns. They did not really expect there to be major wars ever again.",5c590b3a93e8bae6cb9f1907f72d2afb6c478dcc,True,False,,,,,0,1646991937,,0,{},i08145u,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i05373i,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i08145u/,1646991949,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646963137.0,[],text,t2_162o6f,False,True,True

One can praise her for her measures after the scandal of rightwing / nazi structures in a one of the special forces, the KSK - but she didn't have much choice really, as the public &amp; political outrage about it was growing immensly.

AKK also didn't really act when there was another scandal about ammunition &amp; explosives being stolen by certain soldiers (to be later found buried in their garden). The right move would have to be to kick these soldiers out, but they got away with a slap on the hand.

Furthermore, she was a disastrous communicator, even her own party (the CDU) was often angered about her leaving both them, the coalition partner and the parlament in the dark about her plans.

Here is what happened and how the G36 *actually* performs:

In th eearly 2010s, the A400M, NH90 and Euro Hawk procurement disasters had ""matured"" to such an extent that the defense officials could no longer cover up their highly paid incompetence. Additionally, news of equipment shortages tarnished the German Defense Department's image under Thomas de Maizière.

In 2013, Usula von der leyen, the new defense secretary, vowed to sweep out the disaster that is defense procurement. So, she hired a management consultant as state secretary and put pressure on the bureaucrats. Rather than pointing to failed projects that they and not their predecessors were responsible for, they suddenly discovered that the G36 was said to be defective after not just Germany successfully using it for 20 years. And Instead of clarifying this with the manufacturer, they went public with it. Opposition politicans eagerly took up this topic and, as German politicians and bureaucrats had done before with the G11, politics put HK at the edge of financial abyss.

But what about the criticism? An assault rifle magazine holds around three dozen rounds. In the ""test"" in question, someone emptied one magazine after the other with continuous fire and then found that the barrel got hot and aiming at 300(!) meters became inaccurate.

As you might know if you had trained with such weapons, assault rifles are not designed for sustained fire over sevral minutes. This applies to *all* guns comparable to the G36: It would have happened exactly the same with a G3, an AK-47, M-16 or SG550. (It wouldn't have happened so quickly with the aforementioned G11 btw.)

For decades, the G36 had been used without complaint - not only by the Bundeswehr, but also e.g. by the Spanish, Swedish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Uruguayan, Thai and many other armed forces - each after tendering, tests and comparisons. Speaking of desert operations: the Saudi and Jordanian armed forces have also been using the G36 for years.",d2ea24c4ebf2923229fb207a2ce1ac2e5ff96fbe,True,False,,,,,0,1646986531,,0,{},i07uq4s,False,t3_tad8j9,False,True,t1_i00tov1,/r/geopolitics/comments/tad8j9/why_is_germanys_army_bundeswehr_relatively_weak/i07uq4s/,1646986544,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646957731.0,[],text,t2_1jknr8fo,False,False,

The only thing that would stop him would be actually intervening and credibly escalating in kind to any escalation on his part up to nuclear war.  Personally I don’t think Putin is suicidal and if NATO and Europe was willing to escalate and risk nuclear war but always credibly left the option of Russia as the hermit kingdom of Europe, NATO and Europe would win the escalation game.  Putin would take the crazy hermit state and live as the big fish in the small pond…. But it is very rational to not be willing to take the risk needed to prove that out.

People are focused on Ukraine because he has no way of “winning” and achieving his strategic goals for Ukraine, even if he wins militarily.  But Putin has an overarching strategic goal beyond Ukraine.  Stopping the expansion at the very least, but preferably pushing back “the west” and pushing back NATO is what he really wants.  Putin put himself in a bad position because he read the room wrong on international sentiment and resolve and thought going into Ukraine he was going to fight a different war than what he got.

But now he has nothing left to loose on the international relations front.  He knows that none of the countries that oppose him want a nuclear war, so he might as well keep on escalating to try to see how far he can push back NATO, and to see at what point he can break up political unity.  Even if he unilaterally stops now and withdraws, his influence internationally is not going to be repaired and the economic sanctions will not be lifted.  He can’t better his situation through cessation, so why stop?  Might as well let it ride…  If he continues and escalates, militarily “all” he will face is some sort of limited conventional confrontation at most.  Economically he now knows how far “the west” is ready to go, and it was much worse than he expected.  Sure it can get worse, but not that much worse.  Because of the nature of the carve outs, he knows when / how it is going to get worse and by whom, he just does not know when.  And he knows that after he stops eventually, the current carve outs will be the first economic sanctions that will be eventually eased.

Even now, militarily he can accomplish flattening major cities with big guns and bombs, seriously degrading Ukraine’s military, secure the greater Donetsk &amp; Luhansk regions secure a land route between Russia and Crimea, secure water for Crimea and withdraw to those boundaries and try to pretend he won / spin it for his domestic audience.  Then threaten to re-invade and/or nuclear Armageddon if Ukraine or any of of the other border states not yet already down the path of admission are admitted to the EU and NATO.  Also bluster if EU or NATO helps Ukraine rebuild their military.  The EU and NATO may protest and still donate / sell Ukraine military equipment, but as long as Putin or one of his inner circle is in power, Ukraine and likely all the other states on Russia’s periphery that are not yet already along in the process of joining the EU or NATO are not going to be admitted to the EU or NATO, and significant weapons systems transfers are going to be contentious.

&gt; The bitter truth is that Putin has achieved almost all of his political objectives in Ukraine and then some. And may I remind you once again of that Clausewitzian edict that holds to this day, that all war is but a means to political ends.

&gt; So let’s stack up what political ends Russia has either already achieved or is about to achieve. Here is a map of how things stood at the end of yesterday.

[Map](https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a68a3f2a1e8c6c2faed338a80baeb1a5-lq)

&gt; 1. Crimea is irretrievably lost to Russia by Ukraine.

&gt; 2. The Donetsk and Luhansk provinces stand on the verge of being captured (not just the separatist regions which were already occupied but the entire provinces)
&gt; Both provinces will be irretrievably lost to two new puppet regimes installed by Moscow much like Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the case of Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008.

&gt; 3. Worst of all, the Russian Army with the aid of its navy have systematically captured territory in south, creating a land bridge between Donbas and Crimea. That land bridge will ironically enable Russia to continually fuel a violent insurgency in those two provinces against Kyiv, if the latter doesn’t cede them outright. And then Russia achieved some more territory in the South. Only Mariupol holds out on the southeast but is completely surrounded and is being starved and shelled, and once the key port of Odessa in the southwest falls?
&gt; Ukraine will be landlocked. She is doomed after that, given that her navy was already destroyed completely in the invasion of 2014, after many of her naval officers and commanders defected to Russia. Now I hope I don’t need to explain the economic and geopolitical plight of a nation that both has no access to the sea and is also surrounded in the North, East and South by a very hostile and large military power. Russia can pretty much choke and kill any Ukrainian economic or political aspirations whenever she pleases by simply blockading the Black Sea.

&gt; 4. There is zero prospect of whatever rump state of West Ukraine remains of ever joining NATO.

&gt; 5. Ukraine is well on its way to being bombed back to the Stone Age and will take decades to recover, it will not pose a threat anymore as a model of a prosperous democracy in Putin’s lifetime and may not ever do so even in our own lifetimes. It is about as wicked of a crime as one can imagine, but it is what has largely happened.",0ea9ef0b520eab2a042beab22d84e16cabf82a3f,True,False,,,,,0,1646985866,,0,{},i07twfr,True,t3_tbl669,False,True,t3_tbl669,/r/geopolitics/comments/tbl669/answer_to_is_russia_actually_losing_the_war_in/i07twfr/,1646985879,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646957066.0,[],text,t2_43tc2e59,False,False,

First: The west would need to trully unite behind this and also acknowledge that some western countries would also collapse as a result(Some will inevitably break off to save themeselves). How would you convince Japan and South Korea to go along with this knowing well they would be the first to go should China retaliate.

  
Second: Any sanctions large enough to distroy China would be interpreted as an act of war by China. So instead of collapsing the CCP, Chinese people would resort to extreme levels of nationalism.

  
Three: China could also move to deny the west from recreating their lost manufacturing industries by cutting off access to natural resources which come mainly from the third world. Africa is key here, a place where China wields a lot of influence and China also being Africa's largest trading partner would mean that Africa goes with China. The thing is that nearly half of the worlds pupulation if not more, significantly rely on trade with China, and since its trade it goes both ways. So the west threatening the livelihoods of more than half of the world's population would not win them any good friends.(But in all fairness the west could mitigate this by finding some way of framing China as the bad guy).

  
Four: If Push really came to shove, the CCP could resort to Nuclear War and make sure there is no winner. Yes its extreme but the CCP is that fanatical, anything that threatens to revert China to the century of humilition would merit a Nuclear response in their eyes.

Furthermore, there are legitimate reasons to believe that the deterrence equation between Putin-led Russia and NATO is different than that between the more collectively governed USSR and NATO.

Putin may truly believe that the future of Russian civilization is currently at stake, and framed a certain way, he may be right. This is all difficult to calculate.

However, I also wonder to what extent NATO is concerned by the growing support for US retrenchment and even neo-isolation in America, bolstered by temporary war exhaustion. This is a potentially lethal threat to NATO and the future hopes of the liberal international order. As memory of Afghanistan and Iraq recedes, and as Europe starts to free ride less, this anti-liberal order faction in the US may be diminished over time.

Or you think we should avoid it, but pretend to still be considering it?) But in any case, I don't think ""don't reveal plans"" is always good advice.

I guess it depends what you mean by ""plans"". Revealing specific tactics and precise capabilities seems like a bad idea.  But on our broader strategy, I don't think we want our enemies to be completely in the dark. Making clear what lines we won't cross can help prevent unintentional escalation. And making clear what lines we won't allow others to cross, and how we would respond if they did, can be valuable for deterence.

Nuclear deterence has some clear examples of this. E.g., we (the US) want it to be pretty clear that if we were ever attacked with nuclear weapons, we would be willing and able to launch a devastating counter attack. And at the same time, we should want it to be clear that we *wouldn't* ever launch a nuclear first strike.

This is particularly true because the point isn't to ""win"" a nuclear war by catching the enemy by surprise, but to *avoid* a nuclear war in the first place by making it super obvious to our enemies that starting one would be a terrible idea.

&gt;Maybe when the aliens come and humans have to contend with outside life, then we can move away from nationalism.

There is a story that when Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating nuclear disarmament, and talks went nowhere for hours, they went outside for a smoke abd were alone. Reagan asked Gorbachev: ""If aliens attacked US would you come to our aid and fight with us?"" and Soviet president answered ""Definitely, and you?"". ""I think we would do the same"". They went back and stroke the deal within an hour. 

On the serious side, we made enormous effort to move from nationalism and globalism helped with the growth in economy and reduction in wars. But Russia never understood the concept. While the rest of the world saw the Internet as the collection of world knowledge, porn and cat videos, Putin saw it as one of the American weapons. Look into their efforts to make borders on the net. Instead of modernizing their economy he still see it as a resource based. Austrian minister was in UAE few days ago discussing alternatives to Russian oil and gas. EU ministers met yesterday to discuss how can they reduce EU's dependency on Russian oil. If they move to green, nuclear, or find another source, what would be left of the Russian economy? This probably wouldn't happen anytime soon.

But nationalism comes back in the time of crisis. We've seen it at the start of the pandemic. It is closely tied with populism. And in recent years it was an answer to immigration. People need to belong into groups, and many feel threatened when outsiders come in. All these days I am often thinking about Fukuyama and how terribly wrong he was. It is a complete delusion that any ideology will fix all problems and stay there forever. Communists made the same mistake.

Russia has said that they do not plan to occupy or annex Ukraine, Russia's aims are to demilitarize Ukraine, and they will probably change Ukraine's government to something that provides the east and south regions with the autonomy and voting power that was similar to what the Minsk agreement had.

Now how does Ukraine get back to normal, I suppose by losing and giving into Russia sooner rather than later, the longer this goes on I think the last reserved Russia is going to be with their military capabilities. If Russia cannot achieve their objectives, they will just break Ukraine instead.

It makes sense for Russia to invade during the winter time because it increases its leverage, so perhaps they moved forward with the plan ahead of time. 

We can only guess, but the plan has been moving along in different axis and I didn't mention all of it. Take for instance this: 

&gt;The Iran sanctions negotiations in Vienna may be reaching the last stage – as acknowledged even by Chinese diplomat Wang Qun. But it was Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who introduced a new, crucial variable into Vienna’s final discussions.   
&gt;
&gt;Lavrov made his eleventh-hour demand quite explicit: “We have asked for a written guarantee … that the current [Russian sanctions] process triggered by the United States does not in any way damage our right to free and full trade, economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with the Islamic Republic.”
&gt;
&gt;As per the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement of 2015, Russia receives enriched uranium from Iran and exchanges it for yellowcake and, in parallel, is reconverting Iran’s Fordow nuclear plant into a research center. Without Iranian enriched uranium exports there’s simply no JCPOA deal. It boggles the mind that US Secretary of State Blinken does not seem to understand that.  
&gt;
&gt;Everyone in Vienna, sidelines included, knows that for all actors to sign on the JCPOA revival, no nation must be individually targeted in terms of trading with Iran. Tehran also knows it.
&gt;
&gt;So what’s happening now is an elaborate game of Persian mirrors, coordinated between Russian and Iranian diplomacy. Moscow’s Ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, attributed the fierce reaction to Lavrov in some Iranian quarters to a “misunderstanding.” This will all be played out in the shade. 
&gt;
&gt;An extra element is that according to a Persian Gulf intel source with privileged Iranian access, Tehran may be selling as many as three million barrels of oil a day already, “so if they do sign a deal, it will not affect supply at all; only they will be paid more.”

Russia has basically captured or isolated and encircled the major parts of Ukraine, it's a very effective Soviet tactic. When a war through attrition. The West heavily relies on air supremacy and support, there are no better anti-air defense systems in the world and hypersonic missiles than those employed and developed by Russia. The S400 and S500 are are highly regarded.

UN says that Russian casualties and losses are far lower than what Ukraine has reported. Russia has said that they've only suffered 1500 casualties as well. If we get into a war with Russia, it's going to be a devastating war for all sides, they would not lose in a matter of days, it's clear that Russia is not using all of its capabilities right now. Also if Russia gets into a war China would get involved, So could Iran, other friendly allied states to Russia like India might join as well as they have a long history together.

[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,,,,"But you have to see the larger picture: it's not Russia, it's Russia plus China (plus Iran and whoever else feels wronged or threatened or bullied by the West). The western media is still portraying this as ""the world versus Russia"" but it's the ""US, the UE, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore against Russia and its allies"". 

China in particular will be a huge winner out of all of this: CIPS and Unionpay are getting a huge boost that would have taken years to emulate had the sanctions wouldn't have occurred. It was a ""coincidence"" that some military intervention happened every time a country spoke of charging for their resources other than USD. Take a look how the tide is changing, just follow the news:

From the past month:

- Possible End to Dollar Dominance?: Permanent Alterations to the World Order Post-Ukraine - https://thewire.in/world/possible-end-to-dollar-dominance-permanent-alterations-to-the-world-order-post-ukraine

&gt;Third, the US dollar has committed possible harakiri regarding its image as a safe haven. For so many decades, the US Federal Reserve prided itself in stating that every single dollar ever printed is backed by the sovereign and will be honoured. However, ‘Bidenism’ killed this promise twice over – by freezing half of Afghanistan’s seven billion dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves and all of Russia’s foreign exchange dollars. Any central bank will now think several times before buying US treasuries and will always look for alternative safe assets, even if they are a shade less safe. 

...

&gt;Fourthly, China will continue to draw down its US dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves of about $1 trillion in its war chest of $3.4 trillion. Since 2005, China’s share of dollar securities has fallen from 80% to just 30%.
&gt;
&gt;The US’s consistent targeting of Chinese foreign exchange reserves and foreign exchange management, by naming it a ‘currency manipulator’, and its recent last-recourse to economic sanctions, is not lost on Chinese strategists. Even though the Yuan forms only about 3-5% of world trade, the trajectory, through trade-expansionism into EU, South America, Africa and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) nations, is clear.
&gt;
&gt;Coupled with the largest quantum of national central bank digital currency (CBDCs or e-yuans) already issued, possibilities of a yuan-inspired undeclared non-dollar bloc of nations are becoming realistic. 

(Again, the effects of weaponizing the banking system and sanctions, which no one is talking about)

And from the past years: 

- Exclusive: China taking first steps to pay for oil in yuan this year - sources/ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-yuan-exclusive-idUSKBN1H51FA

There's one final thing which nobody talks about and it's an strategic shift of the economic priorities and the way we understand richness and economic strength: About a month ago Facebook lost in a single day 230 billion USD from their stock value. Does that mean that the US became a quarter of a trillion USD poorer in one day? What does that mean in terms of people's quality of life? how do you make such a drop something tangible?

Do you think that Tesla is really worth a trillion USD, three times more than Toyota for instance? based on what? again, what does that value mean in terms of what people can do with their daily lives? Is that what makes the US so much richer than all other countries?

Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia, will also issue UnionPay credit and debit cards. Although only introduced five years ago, 40 percent of Russians already have a Mir card for domestic use. If India was smart it would push for RuPay in Russia too. 

&gt;UnionPay is much larger than you think. It’s already the largest network by number of cards in circulation due to the sheer size of the Chinese economy, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report. While best known and mostly used inside China, where it has about 90% market share, it is growing outside China as well.
&gt;
&gt;UnionPay is both a network and a brand. It has debit, credit and prepaid cards in China. Internationally, it has steadily grown acceptance of UnionPay cards through deals with merchant acquirers and banks that own ATM networks. It also partners with local financial institutions in Southeast Asia, Africa and elsewhere to issue UnionPay cards. The company’s cards are accepted in 180 countries and regions and are accepted by 55 million merchants.

Now Russians will also be able to use their cards internationally, via UnionPay’s growing network. And without Visa and Mastercard, commissions on all transactions will remain in the Russia-China sphere. I foresee a greater push from Russia and its allies to start implementing these solutions, first in closer allies - Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, Iran, Syria, Serbia, the Eurasian Economic Union - and then in other important commercial allies that depend in one way or another to Russia and China - Brazil and Vietnam, for instance. 

And despite some mild insinuations of China limiting financial services to Russia, [Russian companies are rushing to China](https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-russian-firms-rush-open-chinese-bank-accounts-sanctions-bite-sources-2022-03-03/) and even announcing that they can receive payments in yuans. But if that wasn't indication enough, things like the joint naval exercises that they are doing with Russia later this year and [they defending Russia's allegations of biowarfare labs in Ukraine]*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-08/china-pushes-russia-conspiracy-theory-about-u-s-labs-in-ukraine) should give you an idea. 

IV) Russia is starting to go ballistic in their own countermeasures (they supposedly still haven't laid out their entire sanctions package). Besides trading foreign reserves for foreign debt (and susbtituting half a trillion dollars to ruble), they have announced [the nationalization of foreign assets](https://www.reuters.com/business/russia-approves-first-step-towards-nationalising-assets-firms-that-leave-ruling-2022-03-09/) and also [know-how, software and patents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/09/russia-allows-patent-theft/) which account for a bunch of billions more. They are doing this while receiving an incredible amount of extra money from overpriced oil, gas, nickle, wheat, etc.

V) And then there is the tremendous effect that this war will cost on Western companies - particularly in EU - and not because of lost business that will be substituted by other companies in the Russia-China sphere of influence. I haven't seen it in the traditional channels but just take a look at some of what's happening: Michelin closing down four factories in France; steel plants, paper and pulp plants, and fertilizer manufactures closing down all over Europe; Korean car manufactures being highly affected; serious disruptions in the tech industry.

I'm sure that the governments of western nations do symphathize in one way or another for the plight of Ukranians, but I feel inclined to believe that it's not really what has been moving them with such strength against Russia (again, if freedom, democracy and respect for HR's was the commanding principle, Maduro wouldn't have gone from having a 15MM USD bounty on his head to being a potential ally from one day to the other). 

What we are seeing here is a true world war between two power blocks that are trying to redefine the entire bases of the world economic order. I also think the US is trying to move quickly before it starts to feel the heat. It is not casual that Biden yesterday announced studies to issue a digital dollar, a perfect sign of the times.

[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,,,,"This war was a long awaited economic and political confrontation between Russia and the US and its allies and Ukraine was the chosen hill to die on by both parties. We really don't know how any of this will play out at the end, but any analysis that doesn't recognize the reality of the conflict will miss the mark by the most. 

We know that Russia has been long preparing for this war: After the Orange Revolution that first deposed Yanukovich, NATO's Bucharest Summit Declaration's welcoming Ukraine and Georgia as members of NATO and Yanukovich's ousting in 2014, Russia knew - within their geostrategic position - that a military confrontation with Ukraine was inevitable. [They acted like dozens of political analysts and top strategic thinkers had warned us for decades](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t6xnna/crisis_danger_and_opportunity_chinas_geopolitical/hzizvo6/), pointing out the real possibility of a military escalation if NATO expanded towards Ukraine. 

It was precisely in 2014 when Russia accelerated its preparations for this war. Beyond the modernization of its military forces and its performance on the ground which had been happening for some time (and which many will question considering differing the reality on Ukranian soil) Russia began serious efforts to de-dolarize its economy; began its own local alternative to SWIFT (SPFS) in 2014; [started investing billions of dollars to be able to use the Northern Sea Route](http://www.eiu.com/industry/article/591780243/the-northern-sea-route-rivalling-suez/2014-05-02), connecting Western Russia with the Pacific without passing through the Suez canal; and pushed for the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, which was signed on May 29th, 2014 and now has five members: Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. 

Anyone who hasn't been following Russia's foreign policy trajectory in the past years isn't aware of their soft power projection via some very clever international relations maneuvering. For instance, their involvement in the Syrian Civil War not only propped Bashar Al-Assad, but it alsom managed to secure the Tartus sea port in the Mediterranean, but we saw some very interesting developments. I'll just mention a few&gt;

Pay attention to the dates and what has been going during these past years. It shouldn't come as a surprise that sanctions to Russia have come from the US, the EU and its closer allies: Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. That's it, not [Latin America](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/some-latin-american-nations-call-russian-withdrawal-ukraine-2022-02-25/), not Africa, not the [Middle East](https://asiatimes.com/2022/03/why-middle-east-wont-join-us-in-isolating-russia/) and [the rest of Asia](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/world/asia/asia-russia-ukraine-war.html). Even Turkey's response has been mild, that's an interesting case that might need an analysis in itself (which even came at odds with the US because of the purchase of S400 air defense systems). 

There's something else too: People in western countries and the EU might feel automatic solidarity with Ukraine but the rest of the world is much more wary of the US, the UK, France, NATO. It seems to have been erased from public opinion that bombings, displacement and death are still going on in Syria, Somalia, Palestine and Yemen. It doesn't help that there is less oil in the market and suddenly Venezuela and Iran don't seem to be such pariah states but are actually cool soon-to-be democratic allies. That's the sort of thing that Russia exploits, again take a look at Putin's declaration in the Russia-Africa Summit.

During this time China too knew what was up. We know it because they also created their own alternative to SWIFT back then in 2015: CIPS. And also they have been expanding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with India and Pakistan joining in 2017 and Iran being expected to join soon. 


------



So, one might question if Russia was so prepared what can they do to counter the sanctions and come out of what seems like total ruin? And I think that they waited until they could strike, not be totally wrecked and counter-strike to greatest pain. People don't realize that what's happening here is a harsh blow to the dollar as fiat currency:

I) First, [Russia just *de facto* converted 480 billion in foreign debt into rubbles](https://thecradle.co/Article/columns/7672).

&gt;It works like this: to pay for loans obtained from a sanctioning country exceeding 10 million rubles a month, Russian companies do not have to make a transfer. They ask for a Russian bank to open a correspondent account in rubles under the creditor’s name. Then the company transfers rubles to this account at the current exchange rate, and it’s all perfectly legal.
&gt;
&gt;Payments in foreign currency only go through the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis. They must receive special permission from the Government Commission for the Control of Foreign Investment. 
&gt;
&gt;What this means in practice is that the bulk of the $478 billion or so in Russian foreign debt may “disappear” from the balance sheets of western banks. The equivalent in rubles will be deposited somewhere, in Russian banks; but western banks, as things stand, can’t access it.


II) Russia is a major commodities exporter and it's are moving all their payments away from SWIFT, USD and euros. People don't even understand SWIFT but it's good to know what it trully is. From [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e8705d48-bfea-4f95-af3b-af13c1e4305d):

&gt;Swift is a messaging system, not a payment system. Unlike the payments themselves, messages can be sent by many different routes. In the case of Russia, banks could use its own transfer system, the SPFS (Sistema Peredachi Finansovykh Soobscheniy), which was established after the 2014 invasion of Crimea by the Central Bank of Russia.
&gt;
&gt;This system is increasingly used by domestic banks for cross currency payments within the Eurasian Economic Union — made up of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan — and Russia claims it accounted for 17 per cent of Russian international payments messages in 2020. It is also used by some Russian bank subsidiaries in Germany and Switzerland. Russia could also use the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, network created in 2015 by the People’s Bank of China for the purpose of cross-border payments in renminbi. CIPS features indirect participants in many countries. All these systems — Swift, SPFS, and CIPS — have the same architecture based on the global payments messaging standard ISO20022. 

The US and the EU had the monopoly on banking messagging less than a decade ago. They weaponized it when they attacked Iran (and later Venezuela) and now they don't have a monopoly. And Russia can use their leverage to charge all their resources in whatever denomination they want.",d49bf7c33d89d53b5c71962689ad1df3184b4517,True,False,,,,,0,1646964571,,0,{},i06t439,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i06t439/,1646964587,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646935771.0,[],text,t2_24531htf,False,False,

have you ever studied game theory? there are multiple limitations on predicting opponent behavior, one of them is that you may not be dealing with a rational actor, and others are that not all knowledge in the game is common to every player. For example, if russia has some type of secret technology, its a game changer. i dont care if thats realistic, just a point about how unknown knowledge can change the game.

Thinking that the conversation starts and ends at MAD is middle school level thinking, especially because that is a ""doctrine"", or a dogmatic teaching.

suicide, maybe he wants to go out in a blaze of glory. Bad strategy to discount possibilities. When you are walking around in a big city you shouldn't assume you arent going to get robbed because the person will go to jail, or that someone wont do something because no rational person would do it. People dont always behave rationally and in addition, the other persons risk assessment, and how they value the outcome may be different.

[],False,,TikiTDO,,,,,,"Would conscripts actually be required in a modern hot war? The one thing that's stood out to me in this entire conflict is how fundamentally different the Russian approach to modern war is compared to what we know about the modern US approach. Russia seems to be treating this conflict as an extension of WW2; get a bunch of young guys together with some tanks, and send them into another country. Granted, they haven't brought out some of the new toys they've been talking about, but that also probably means they haven't trained with them much.

For the US the approach these days (well, for the past few decades) seems to be more about the technology. It's all about sensors, drones, space resources, networking, smart munitions, over-the-horizon capability, and expensive gadgets. It might not have been very effective in the middle east, but that largely came down to the fact that it was nearly impossible to tell combatants from non-combatants. Against a more traditional enemy sporting tanks, APCs, artillery, and planes the approach is a lot more likely to be effective, particularly given the amount of experience that the US military was able to get in conflicts over the last few decades.

With such an technology-oriented military, getting a bunch of conscripts feels like it would be a waste of time. It would simply take too long to train conscripts to use the new tech, and in a similar vein, returning back to the old ways of fighting wars would render all the tactics and strategies built around this technology redundant.

Honestly, I imagine the biggest thing keeping the US out of the conflict is twofold. One is the risk of it going nuclear. I don't think anyone wants to see how a modern nuclear conflict would play out. The second is the famous Napoleon quote: ""Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."" At this point Russia has burned through all the international good will it had remaining, and is quickly burning through the good will of it's own people by talking about increasing conscription. It's thrown away god knows how many billions of dollars worth of equipment and munitions, and for all that it has shown barely any results. Making this into a hot war would let Putin unify the Russian public against a common enemy. By not giving in to these provocations the US is forcing Putin into more and more extreme actions, which leave him looking like a complete on both the domestic and the international stage.

If Putin does decide to escalate into attacking NATO, I wouldn't be too surprised if there is a swift, but limited response.
