You can tell he's scared for his family and he is in a tight tight spot. He can't openly say anything against Russia and can't openly support them even if he's ordered to.

Jarmir Jagr is one of the greatest Russian players behind ovechkin and he was forced out of the NHL probably on threat of death to go play back in Russia because Putin needed to boost morale in his country. Or just because he was a fanboy. Watch some clips of Putin playing against pros and watch how scared they are of him.

Here. Read.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Non-Aligned-Movement

&gt;You can have the minimal moral decency to state that invasions of soverign, countries without reason, is wrong considering you suffered it yourself. 

We have our own interests here .

Just as you have yours. Russia is our old friend,west is not. Secondly,russian allegations about there being Nazis is true,the Nazi problem is a large one in ukraine. 

&gt;Wars in Europe are very much your concern as are wars anywhere. 

Least bothered. 

It is rather an opportunity for us. India is raising steel and wheat output. 

&gt;Next plague we'll just say that in SE Asia it is none of our concern? 

You can say so.

Why would we care  ? South East Asia has progressed a lot. 

&gt;No we sent aid. 

We sent aid to Ukraine too.

Humanitarian aid is different. Political stances are different. 

&gt;You're part of the informal to formal BRiC alliance and you want your Russian weapons at the minimum. 

Our friendship with USSR is old.

The USSR was instrumental in helping us in stopping the genocide of bengalis in 1971. NATO supported the genocide by threatning to attack India. 

&gt;At worst you're pivoting towards totalitarianism. As to ""radical militias"" it sounds like the bigots are pervasive enough in India not to need separate units in India. 

Thry are pervasive everywhere.

Just like in US. However,in India,even Pakistan,it is not an explicit part of state policy unlike Ukraine. 

&gt;And I doubt Modi would've complained if it had been them getting your people out. 

Ironical that you complain about Modi.

Modi is considered as a US shill due to his affection for the US. 

I am an opposition supporter,I would rather be happy with NATO squirming. The left has openly taken sides on the conflict,if they would have been in power,we would have opposed NATO. 

&gt;On the medical students thank you....we have that in the US too. But it isn't cheaper. The less accomplished students go to Caribbean schools and pay several times more and are recognized, as are FMGs, as inferior

Reason why we abstained.

Like a lot of other countries. We have our own problems and are busy solving them.

A war in Europe is non of our concern just like wars in South Asia are not yours.

&gt;Oh yeah that group WAS one unit of 2500 and no longer exists. 

Part of the army now.

It is an army unit. Endorsement by the state.

&gt;Out of your 1 billion plus how many are religious zealots ready to kill others over your absurd religious squabbles?


We have zealots.

However,for every country in Asia apart from Afghanistan,Iraq and Libya, there is a difference. We do not incorporate radical militias into our militaries. Ukriane does. It is on the same level as iraq, afghsnistan and libya.

Students who do not score well go to Ukraine because the entrances are easy and the courses are cheaper there.

I was surprised to hear they supposedly still have the majority of their fixed wing craft as we havent heard of much about them but its probably not strategically opportune to use them when they are doing so well with drones and other hit and run or guerrilla tactics that are knocking out vehicles left and right.

More of these land based AA missile systems would be amazing though and there are talks about giving them S300 SAM systems which would give them a nice advantage in this urban ground war with those hit and run tactics to keep the skies clear.

Its just beyond unfortunate that Ukraine has been screaming about this invasion for almost a decade and no one believed them or helped them enough. The flip side of that coin is that the Ukraines have been preparing and figuring out the best startegy to fight this exact war with Russian tactics that haven't changed in half a century.

I just hope they get planes or whatever it is they need to save as many as possible and stop this new version of Hitler so it doesnt boil over into WW3.

However fighters are useless, they'll do better with the Anti Air and Anti Tank missiles.  
  
The support you need for fighters to operate usefully makes tanks look like Toyotas.  
  
They need runways, hangers, fuel, repair, loaders  
  
Anti Air is mobile, cheap and VERY effective especially for this type of fighting  
  
Most of the bombs the Russians are using are dumb, no guidance. Meaning the aircraft have to get low to bomb accurately, that's when you hit them with the Anti Air missiles.  
  
Force the pilots to either commit to the bombing run or defend against the missile, they can't do both at the same time.   
  
This is a logistical fight, if Ukrainians can get those missiles spread out thru the city's they can eat away the the Russian air offensive, If the Russians think it's safer to use cruise, and guided munitions, it will be much more expensive, taking more resources, depleting their ever shrinking war chest, Not to mention how much it must kill moral when the Russians see a SU-25 go down , the one that's supposed to provide close air support for armor and infantry.
