One thing to keep in mind with regards to Israeli politics is that the left-right spectrum is not comparable to that of the US (for example).

The divide revolves mainly around national security and attitudes towards the Arab-Israeli conflict (i.e. Palestinians).. if you transplanted the current ruling party to the US they'd be considered left leaning socialists.

Israel's stance vis-a-vis Ukraine is similarly centered around how it would affect Israel's security, specifically with regards to Russia's presence in Syria and its involvement in the Iran/NPT issues.

&gt; the grain shortage

Israel has significant agricultural (amongst other) ties to India, i would assume this would be the preferred route given the current Russia sanctions.

&gt; being ""taken over"" by Turkey be a factor in their action?

Israel treads carefully and suspiciously with Turkey - more so than it does with Russia. Turkey hosts and to an extent supports the Hamas militant group, and the Turkish president often makes inflammatory and threatening remarks aimed at Israel such as claiming 'Jerusalem is our city' and calling Israel a terrorist state.",41ba5eaeaeadeca59121a09e742adfb4269be74b,True,False,,,,,0,1648165933,,0,{},i2005xq,False,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t1_i1sb7re,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i2005xq/,1648165950,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648137133.0,

I don’t think even Russia feels this is a viable option.  The preferred Russian plan seems to have been a combination of territorial concessions that gave them the oil rich areas of Ukraine together with a puppet regime, but at this point that solution has the same problems as occupation.  Propping up a deeply unpopular regime is going to require resources that Russia just doesn’t have.  Their *best* outcome at this point is territorial concessions in the south with the potential for serious civil unrest.  That isn’t likely to be perceived as a decisive victory even by the more starry-eyed member of Z nation.",a2c9c15c602258dcd286d96b8b3fc5061213c029,True,False,,,,,0,1648157598,,0,{},i1zgffw,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_i1yixe3,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i1zgffw/,1648157610,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648128798.0,

I strongly want to believe you understood what i meant and is pretending to not know aka strawmaning me.

first of all, i never said there is zero liberal thought in the eastern cultures. The world is not black and white, yes or no, 1 or 0. Instead there is aways an 'in between'. There are people inclined to liberalism and authoritarism everywere.

I never said ""the west is liberal and the east is authoritarian"". What i said is that, based on several indicators, there is a clear distinction between western and eastern cultures specially when it comes to government types, when you look at it on a MACRO level... If you look at the small picture, then yes, your examples of liberalism in the east and authoritarianism in the west will fit in, but if you look at the bigger picture you'll hopefully understand what i mean. So once more i suggest you search for the newest index of democracy.

Is it a coincidence the west tends to be more democratic than the east?

yes yes, there was a wave of iliberalism after the french revolution, so what? does that mean that since there was this wave, the revolution didn't change anything? there was no change in mentality at all? is that the logic?

Is it nonsense to characterize this as east vs west, when there is a clear statistical discrepancy when you look at the map? when putin himself refers to europe and america as west. is it nonsense when our history is deeply marked by this?

the greeks vs persians, the romans vs persians, the crusades, the great schism, and yet, let's simply pretend west vs east is not one of the many narratives we tell ourselves that make up civilization.

And then, lastly, you tell me autocracies don't need to expand and conquer, because there were cases of isolationism although you were not specific as to what state you're talking about.

Syria murders Druze, Christians murder Muslims, Jordanians murder Palestinians... it's a mess on a level that anyone who's never lived in that neighborhood could barely hope to understand, much less unwind. When you live in a neighborhood like that, having strong friends who can push back against all the other people trying to murder you is a massive benefit.

Within Israel (as the Jewish state it currently is) there are Druze (who are far more committed to Israel's security than most Jews even), there are Bedouins, a few flavors of Christians and a large number of Israeli Arab Muslims (mostly Sunni but also Shi'ite)... (there are other smaller groups, but you get the point). Most of those people have been happy living in Israel for a long time because they know what life was like outside of Israel and living in a modern democracy is way nicer. Where Israel missed the mark (and this is having an impact across those groups today) is that while they can vote and participate in most aspects of civic life, their in-group issues are not high priorities for Israel, so they rarely get to feel like it's their nation to have a real stake in. Sure, if the economy gets better, all boats rise, but Israel has no huge incentive to look into troubles that are specific to Bedouins for example unless those problems elevate into crimes/terrorism.

There is an event in Israeli cultural memory known as the missed opportunity from when Israel took the West Bank from Jordan. When Israelis first showed up, Palestinians were glad to no longer be under the heel of a king and enjoyed the new levels of commerce that the two groups were having with each other. Israelis would go visit the towns in the West Bank for tourism and on dates and similar things were happening with Palestinians visiting Israel. The miss was that at that moment, Israel should have simply annexed the territory and handed those Palestinians Israeli citizenships. Sadly, as almost all national governments seem to do, they didn't feel an urgency to do something and so they sat on the situation as it was. That whole time, the PLO was building up funds and recruits across the Arab world with the idea being to poison the well between the two peoples and to use Palestine as a lever for eventually deconstructing Israel.

Had Israel not missed that moment, we might be looking at a very different ME today.

Of course being too clever by half, Israel's solution to the PLO was to establish Hamas and we know pretty well how THAT turned out...

&gt; While there is definitely some economic pain hitting the Russians, their economy has not collapsed as was bullishly claimed would happen. The USD to Ruble exchange rate, which went from about 1:84 to 1:135 a week after the first sanctions, has since gone down to roughly 1:100. The price of oil is still trending upwards, ensuring that the Russians will be making good money for the foreseeable future even though currently selling their oil at a discount.

Yeah I think this is being extremely generous to Russia. We knew their economy would continually be propped up by oil, but the exchange rate losing 20% of the value in a month is still extremely bad for their economy. 

Sanctions will take time for their effects to show but the long term effects of western companies pulling out of Russia will be a long term detriment. Russia's threats to nationalize companies will lead to a long term chilling in international investment as well.

I will not comment on the situation on the ground as much is still hidden by the fog of war and therefore up for dispute, but when it comes to the political and economic war being waged against Russia by the western powers, it's clear that the early assessments of the damages suffered by Russia have thus far proven overblown.

While there is definitely some economic pain hitting the Russians, their economy has not collapsed as was bullishly claimed would happen. The USD to Ruble exchange rate, which went from about 1:84 to 1:135 a week after the first sanctions, has since gone down to roughly 1:100. The price of oil is still trending upwards, ensuring that the Russians will be making good money for the foreseeable future even though currently selling their oil at a discount.

In the political sphere, despite much-ballyhooed claims about the ""[international community](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOLC_xiXEAUp9Hp?format=jpg&amp;name=orig)"" standing united against Russian agression and about how Russia's embarassing preformance and western sanctions would reduce it to a pariah state, no one outside the western bloc and its close east-asian allies has actually joined in on imposing sanctions on Russia. China has hardened its stance against the US, accusing them of being the main instigator in the conflict, while India staunchly refuses western calls for it to distance itself from Russia. Many other countries, including the likes of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico in Latin America, have also signalled their intentions to mantain friendly relations with Russia. The middle eastern states, with which Russia has been building closer relationships over the past decade, are almost unanimously turning away from the west and towards Russia and China.

2) The author of the OP wants to sell her 'brand' though, her 'implementation of a system'.

For people to switch/copy and implement, what you are selling must appear to be clearly superior in some way to make up for the initial switching costs ideally with real world data/results to look at (the best data point to look at is your own implementation, the one you the seller runs/owns).

My point was, if your implementation of a given 'system' is as great as you suggest, that is to say it is vastly superior to alternatives, it will automatically spread in the long run without forcing anything due to peoples natural tendency to copy what *clearly* works. 

If your implementation of democracy was clearly well functioning/performing it would suggest to others that your implementation could be rated say &gt;85/100, and hence, since it is much higher than the average 50/100, most people would in the long run copy and implement your system, since the differential is worth the longer run switching costs.

If your implementation of democracy doesn't appear to be functioning and performing that well, hence rated say 60~65/100, for many countries it wouldn't be worth it, and you'd have to go back to the drawing board and improve your implementation.

Good things will naturally spread in the long run, since humans being are intelligent, and hence can analyze and compare results, and hence like to copy and implement what is good. If what you are selling doesn't appear to be selling as much as you expected, it simply means what you are selling doesn't appear to be as good as you think it is.",074fc88b5f8592508cb93d143b7103fa59049ca2,True,False,,,,,0,1648144067,,0,{},i1yi21f,False,t3_tl8wiz,False,True,t1_i1xvo11,/r/geopolitics/comments/tl8wiz/madeleine_k_albright_the_coming_democratic_revival/i1yi21f/,1648144081,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648115267.0,

[],False,,EqualContact,,,[],,,,text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,"There are several things in play I think. One is just that the ""vibe"" that Nazi propaganda creating was a highly infectious one for several reasons. It appeals to a sense of machismo and empowers people who feel downtrodden/disregarded by society. For this reason, elements of Nazism are easily coopted into other ideologies.

As for Ukraine specifically, independence from Russia has been very fleeting for most of the region's existence—Putin is not wrong that the Ukrainian state is a relatively new idea. There was a moment after Brest-Litovsk where it seemed that an independent Ukraine might come into existence, but the quick collapse of the Central Powers meant that the USSR was able to gobble it back up rather quickly. This (and the brutal war) left a further bad impression about Russia with the Ukrainians, but there were friendly sentiments for the Germans who had tried to make independence happen.

Ukraine was of course terribly effected by Stalinism in the 1930s, so the Soviet state was *very* unpopular when the Germans returned in 1941. People have speculated that if the Nazis hadn't been so vehemently anti-Slavic, their invasion probably could have caused a collapse of the Soviet state, and they would have been welcomed as liberators.

Some Ukrainians of course—perhaps consumed with hatred for the USSR/Russians—decided to collaborate with the Nazis in spite of the horrors that were visited on their countrymen. They did this in the name of an independent Ukraine, though ultimately they were essentially ""useful idiots"" for the Nazis.

Flash forward to post-Soviet Ukraine though, the nation as a whole lacks meaningful symbols and history to differentiate it from Russia. Many of their attempts to find symbols and ideology that differentiate Ukraine from Russia inevitably ties back to earlier independence movements, many of which had ties to the Nazis or Germans in general. This is not to excuse such ideology, and the Ukrainians do try to stop using symbols when their Nazi associations become obvious, but it's difficult to find common cultural things that make you different when the government campaigned for centuries to eliminate such things.

This is just a brief summary of course, but hopefully it helps.",a4180e9d3391444839a065ce8ba72e4fe69a80cb,True,False,,,,,0,1648143672,,0,{},i1yh18o,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i1xg3mn,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i1yh18o/,1648143690,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648114872.0,

I don't know much about China's social credit scores or how it works, but in the western world, you are judged, often without much context, all the time. Credit scores and criminal records means one bad decision can hold you back from climbing the social ladder, possibly for ever.

There are services you probably use, like Uber, where everyone involved in the transaction has the ability to review all those involved. 

And marginalization happens in all sorts of other ways. Think about fines. Most countries issues the same fine for the same infraction, but the punishment is not equal depending on your net worth. A $200 traffic violation is pocket change to a millionaire, but it could make someone living paycheque to paycheque miss their rent payment. Their landlord will kick them out, and when they try to get another apartment, that new landlord will ask for references from other landlords. Hrm

&gt; You can be disappeared at a whim of the state.

I'm not sure about other countries, but you can be arbitrarily detained in the US under a variety of circumstances.

They don't need proof, nor to charge you with that crime though.

The U.S. has been “extremely trigger-happy” with stinging economic measures, and central banks may decide to diversify their portfolio of foreign reserves instead of relying heavily on the U.S. dollar, according to the co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.



He said one in 10 countries in the world is under some form of U.S. sanctions.



“That has a cumulative effect and as a result, we see the dollar playing less and less of a role and portfolios of central banks,” Luft said.



“On the one hand, you are sanctioning right and left. On the other hand, you want countries to buy your Treasurys and finance your debt. That’s not a sustainable scenario,” he said.


--- end article quotes --- 


Even before the new sanctions on Russia, the dollar's share of global foreign reserves (59%) is at a 25 year low and have consistently decreased around 1% per year since 2016. The new sanctions on Russia will likely accelerate the diversification of global reserves away from the dollar.

My point is still valid. Your claim is that it is happening regularly and by implication to the present day. Which is a valid rebuttal and disproves your statement that it’s happening to modern day.  If you want revise your statement, that’s acceptable, but what you said as it is stated is false. Also, israel was not a developed country in the 1948, as that’s what you are referring to. Also, I’m 1946, the allied power expelled 14 million Germans from Eastern Europe, who have been living there for centuries, to Germany. Germany was a developed nation, so that false as well.

Current system dictates that no country can invade and take land from another sovereign country. Perhaps some ex colonial nations might have seen benefits from being able to redraw their borders through small wars, but at large it keeps peace and prevents excessive bloodshed. 

And although we can't simulate alternative histories, we can compare the alternatives. During cold war we had the Soviet alternative, which did seem promising at first, but at some point it was clear that it wasn't a better alternative. China is trying to build an alternative, but they don't seem to have a humanist approach, which is a must at this point in our civilization imo. No one is trying to build an international system based on fascist, monarchic or communistic ideologies anymore either. So this is the best we can do right now. 

I also don't think that the current system is that violent. We have free trade, free flow of capital and people, exchange of culture and little overall violence worldwide.

Evolution works by selecting against traits that provide a bias against passing on genes. Many species have traits that have no function or even are even a detriment but manage to continue just fine. Red hair in humans is a prime example of a genetic abnormality that confers neither advantage not disadvantage, but was likely the result of it spreading in a small population. Many skinks have legs that are nearly or completely useless but require the skink to expend energy and nutrients to maintain, but they continue to propagate. Nothing forces the skinks to evolve towards legless states, and they could randomly start to evolve larger legs.

Applying evolutionary principles to society is difficult. Biological evolution is not driven by conscious effort but through random, minute, changes over time. When humans change society in whatever direction, it is through a conscious effort to do so.

We use ""evolve"" as a colloquial verb to describe gradual change in societies, but the analogy quickly falls apart when trying to apply the biological definition.

&gt;	Point is, humans are animals to copy and learn from each other. They inherently desire to copy what they perceive as working well. If it looks like they don’t want to copy what you are doing, it’s because you are setting a very bad example.

Human society is extremely complex and humans in general are bad at recognizing advantages and estimating risk. They are mostly set in their routines and more concerned about what puts food in their mouth and a roof over their heads for another week. If they don't want to copy what you're doing, it's not necessarily because it's bad.

I wrote a topic that was locked by moderation, reason unknown. So I'm going to ask my question here to see if anyone can help me understand. Hopefully I will not get censored this time.

Everyone mention the fact that Ukrainians felt relieved by Nazi Germany ""liberating"" them from Stalin's heavy hand. But I can't find a satisfactory explanation on why the sympathy remained right after Hitler's occupation, much less an explanation on why there is STILL sympathy for Third Reich to this day in Ukraine, with so much History and information available to everyone.  
  
It's undisputed that the joy for the arrival of the Wehrmacht only lasted until the Schutzstaffel started purging the ""inferior Slavs"".  
  
The phenomenon is not limited to Ukraine and its Azov Battalion, although they are the center of attention right now. There are cases of Neo-Nazi Slavs in Poland, the one country to have suffer the most under Germany occupation in the WW2, and even cases in Russia itself. All that putting aside the Slavs in the Balkans.  
  
Is ""pure ignorance"" the only explanation for this?

Sure. 

When people refer to modern day expulsions, they either mention the case of Sheikh Jarrah ( /wiki/Sheikh_Jarrah_controversy ) which is a decades long legal property dispute concerning about 13 families. Some have been evicted 20 years ago, others are still asserting their rights to remain and their case is brought to the spotlight every few months as the court proceedings continue. 

Other times people refer to the occasional destruction of Bedouin villages and encampments as proof of ethnic cleansing. ( /wiki/Unrecognized_Bedouin_villages_in_Israel ) which is rare enough to warrant outcries and controversy when they occur. The most notable case is that of Al-Araqeeb which has been demolished and rebuilt a few times and which also concerns a few individuals.

Other times people refer to the Israeli policy pf house demolitions ( /wiki/Israeli_demolition_of_Palestinian_property )
. I find the wiki page to offer a fair picture of what’s going on. 

Related of course is the alleged Israeli policy of Judaization of East-Jerusalem. ( /wiki/Palestinian_displacement_in_East_Jerusalem ) which puts hundreds of Palestinians at risk of evictions according to OCHA. 

Usually though people will refer to the ongoing refugee issue which was created following the Nakba / Israel’s war of independence in 1947-1948  when some 700’000 Palestinians became refugees. Their descendants, still considered refugees, are numbered at around 5.4 million last I checked. 

As to the question of how many Palestinians have been illegally and systematically expelled recently, that’s up to discussion.

 If one considers every single eviction in East Jerusalem (and thus disregarding entirely the legal context relating to building permits or property rights), as ethnic cleansing, then a few dozen people have been ethnically cleansed in the aforementioned Sheikh Jarrah case.

That’s a slippery slope though: it’s enough in that case for a Palestinian who illegally built a shack to be considered a victim of ethnic cleansing, which in my opinion is blatantly offensive when compared to the hundreds of thousands of victims of actual ethnic cleansing in Ethiopia, Myanmar or Syria as recently as this year.",b9ca8c2e297e9295fc39916046d0a1e33cd2c190,True,False,,,,,0,1648128369,,0,{},i1xenw7,False,t3_tl4u2d,False,True,t1_i1xa31c,/r/geopolitics/comments/tl4u2d/do_mass_forced_expulsions_and_population/i1xenw7/,1648128381,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648099569.0,

* I’m unsure where this fixation on dead cops came from, seeing as how I ever brought it up. In fact, the FE incident was the very *last* I mentioned. You may want to brush up on strawmen and their role as a logical fallacy. 

* Equivocating one eventual death to cops resorting to firearms at the very beginning is poor form. That was a group in a choke point, trying to break through a barrier. Everyone saw the shooting and it this had a chilling effect on all present. That’s generally not how it works when troops fire on crowds. I refer you to the Boston Massacre and how it took more than one fatal shooting. In a time when a trained soldier could fire something like three rounds per minute, as opposed to the capacity and rate of fife of modern firearms. 

* There remains the disconnect between your stated position (they were invited in) and reality (they overran inadequately manned barricades and the cops there didn’t have the manpower to resist). Again, we circle back to Capitol/Metropolitan forces being inadequate. Note also that military resources were not present despite it being known in advance that there would be a “Stop the Steal” rally nearby. It’s almost like someone tried to underman the lines and then stage a self coup. 

* You should look up the definition of insurrection. A group of rioters, some of whom appear to have been armed and/or planned to deploy armed assets, effected entry into a government building during the certification of votes, then proceeded to attempt to force those lawmakers present to overturn the will of the people. That and BLM are not the same, no matter how many strawmen you want to trot out. 

* Petition for redress of grievances is a sanctioned right. Storming the Capitol is not.

The answer is that the west accounts for over  40% of the global economy, Russia didn't account for 4% before sanctions take a bite. The petrodollar still means stability, providing you don't go roflstomping on the west's doorstep. Also there are no real alternatives, since the Yuan is only worth what China says, and they aren't above forced nationalisation either.

This collective action also actually boosts the west's future power since it shows that the west isn't weak and decadent as China and Russian like to portray, and is in fact capable of acting in unison inspite of democracy, which is often portrayed as a weakness.

Regarding sanctions, the other options were let Putin get away with it, at which point Moldova, Poland Romania and the Baltic States would have been next (hey, they didn't budge for Ukraine....), Or go straight to a military invasion with the risk of nuclear escalation. This is probably the solution that actually hurts Russians the least.

Regarding the treaty, it will probably be multilateral, and the end of sanctions will be part of the deal. Could Ukraine just gun for it and get everything back?

[],False,,EqualContact,,,[],,,,text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,"&gt;I have a feeling the West may have seriously harmed its future power. By releasing such monumental sanctions, I don't see how the majority of the world continues to invest in reserves or use the petrodollar as before. It's going to look way too risky for them.

It's possible, but the West has some strong arguments for those that might be concerned. Most notably, they warned Putin very sternly about the consequences of his actions and gave him a great deal of time to back down. Indeed, it was popular to suppose that Putin wouldn't attack because the risk of sanctions was much greater than the potential reward. 

Furthermore, it isn't as if there are other global reserve currencies. Maybe China can start advocating for the Yuan that way, but their own policies currently prevent this from developing. The West continues to be far more economically stable than the rest of the world, and therefore alternatives to the Dollar and Euro are problematic. This will change eventually, but currently there just aren't a lot of options out there.

&gt;Another worry: I see a social trend of how the people of Rus should all collectively ""suffer"" economically since Ukrainians are. Of course, Rus is way less financially secure than the US or EU, so sanctions are easier to add whereas these types of sanctions on the West would either be impossible or incredibly detrimental for another country to impose. But I'm seeing a strange cultural shift in how war is perceived, and politically on how to combat it, that I think is due to this being a truly ""online"" war and also in a European country.

I share some concerns, but I note that western leaders have been far more measured in their response than random Twitter handles. It's natural for people to be angry at Russia, and currently neither the West nor Ukraine benefits from allaying those feelings. This will change when peace eventually happens. We are likely to have Zelensky himself calling for mercy and forgiveness once a settlement has been reached.

In the meanwhile, I do think that there is some concern with hatred towards Russians. I don't think there is much to be done about it at the international level though, rather that local communities will have to wrestle with such issues.

On the macro level though, there is some responsibility given to the nation of Russia for their current actions. Whether Putin has majority support or not (there's no evidence he lacks support), the Russian people within the country have primarily been passive to the government's policies. The sanctions are designed to disable and deplete Russia's ability to effectively wage war. In the past the West has attempted to avoid inflicting pain on the Russian people, but in the current situation there appears to be little reason to spare them discomfort.

&gt; the most likely ending to this conflict is a signed treaty, but what is the political will of those in the West to even facilitate it?

Western leaders will be very happy for a path that allows them to return some manner of normality to relations with Russia. I agree this will not be popular, but I think Zelensky selling such an agreement on the behalf of Ukraine would go a long ways towards bridging the gap, and give politicians enough cover to do what they would prefer to do anyways.

Even a total win for Ukraine (not realistic) where they expel Russians to their 1991 borders is unlikely to result in a total lifting of sanctions and return to 2021 relations with Russia. Most likely the West allows Russia to use SWIFT again and releases their frozen reserves, enabling their economy to stabilize, but sanctions on individuals and on certain industries (microchips) would likely remain at first.

I think sanction relief will depend upon how satisfied Ukraine is with the peace, but some sanctions will last for decades unless there is a very significant change in Russia's government.

And seeing as Israel has Russia on its borders without NATO or U.S. troop protection, like South Korea, Japan, and Europe do, I’m sure Israel would be willing to trade whatever symbolic sanctions you think they need to implement in exchange for troops guarding it from Iran and Russia on its northern border.

I have heard of that. Have you heard of him much in the past few years? How many front page stories on Saudi Arabia’s response to Ukraine and how many about Israel?

South Korea pays **some of the cost** of defending them. The rest of it is paid by the US. The US pays $4 billion a year to protect South Korea, and puts US troops’ lives on the line.

Aid to Israel is typically less money than that, with zero American troops on the line. It also is entirely spent on US goods, while in South Korea, the U.S. is paying for supplies and injecting cash into the South Korean economy.

Defending South Korea undoubtedly costs more *and* has more risk to American lives than Israel. It’s weird how you think because they pay some portion of the cost, that means footing the rest of the bill should be ignored, even when it costs more and benefits the US less economically (in terms of where the money is spent) than aid to Israel.

In Japan, costs are over $5 billion a year.

The bases are absolutely there to defend both. To pretend otherwise is wrong.

Japan and South Korea have taken the same stance as Israel. They closed any loopholes to sanction Russia the same way the U.S. has, as has Israel. They provided humanitarian aid. They condemned Russia.

Unlike Israel, they haven’t put field hospitals out there though. They aren’t risking their citizens’ lives like Israel to help Ukraine’s people.

They also aren’t taking in significant numbers of refugees, like Israel is. Israel has taken in over 164 times more refugees than Japan, and in per capita terms, the disparity is over 2,000 times.

Oh, and Israel is the one mediating, something Zelensky has personally and repeatedly thanked them for.

Yes, RAtN is given to only non-Jews. That’s irrelevant to the point.

Thank you for proving my point re: Netherlands. That is a state that proves the exceptional rescue of Jews in the Netherlands by comparison to larger states with more Jews. Again, you’ll notice the states with the most Jews and thus opportunities for rescue have them most RAtN. But if you do it on a per-capita basis, it becomes clear that having the fourth most doesn’t make you special. Per capita, the Netherlands is special. Ukraine is not. It was the same or worse than most.

You claim the quote doesn’t say they were enthusiastic. Here is the direct witness testimony:

&gt; The wind carried sparks from one building to another, the fire crackled and soared into the sky mercilessly, and the bones of the first victims crunched. **An enthused mob** of shrieking peasants, just like locusts, pounced on everything that belonged to the Jews.

So uh, yes it does. I also added another quote you didn’t respond to.

Who am I to say it’s far less severe? Seriously?

Numbers say it’s far less severe. Statistics and facts say so. We don’t have to pretend you have to have lived through both to know the difference. More Jews died per day in the Holocaust than civilians in Ukraine in the past month, even though the lethal weaponry of war is significantly more powerful today than back then.

You then say you wouldn’t compare your situation to that of others, **which is exactly what he did**. So maybe now you get how it is a complete rewriting of history he did not live, featuring statistics that show precisely how different they are.

Righteous Among the Nations is awarded to only non-Jews. Also, the Netherlands had a Jewish population of 159,806 and has the second most Righteous Among the Nations. So, I feel that your whole comparison lacks backing.

Regarding collaboration, it is something that has been well researched both within the context of the Holocaust and in other contexts. IMO, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland by Christopher Browning is an essential read. The quote you provided does not say they were ""enthusiastic"" (I read page 143-145). Your statement that they were ""free to finally kill their Jewish neighbors"" is disingenuous. Collaboration is an interesting phenomenon and goes way beyond that. There are cases where neighbours who were on very good terms, turned on each other. I would never say ""finally kill"" as if they always had a deep desire to do it. 

But we can both agree that collaboration indeed occurred in large scale. 

And honestly, your statement ""He also minimized the Holocaust by comparing it to a far different, and far less severe (albeit still bad) situation."" is appalling. While I do not necessarily agree with him using the Holocaust as a comparison. Who are you to say its far less severe just because it does not impact you? Total disregard of other's lived experience.

It's not any agreement, and [regarding the Taba Summit](http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1644149_1644147_1644141,00.html) ""The summit ended only days before the Israeli election, which Barak lost to Ariel Sharon . . .

That was prior to the Taba Summit, and as explained on that page, the situation at the time was:

&gt;The Israelis agree to contribute to an international fund to be established for the compensation of Palestinian refugees. However, Israel wants the fund to compensate Jews who came to the country from Arab states. Israel agrees to the return of hundreds of refugees under a family reunification plan or on humanitarian cases. The Palestinians want Israel to take moral and legal responsibility for the refugee crisis. UN Resolution 194 must be accepted so that all refuges are guaranteed the right of return, and by return we mean to Israel. Refugees who chose to return and those who do not must be compensated. The Absentee Treasurer created in Israel in 1949 to administer refugee money is responsible for the compensation. Host countries should also be compensated. An international fund could be established but that fund would only be responsible for part of the compensation. We refuse to mix the issue of Palestinian refugees with Jews immigrants.

Because there were so many Jews in Ukraine, there were more ""Righteous Among the Nations"". That's how it works. Poland has the most Righteous, and yet also the largest number of Jews killed during the Holocaust were killed there (over half). Poland has 7,177, and 3 million Jews died in Poland.

Ukraine has 2,673, and nearly 1.5 million Jews died in Ukraine.

Just to put that in perspective there was 1 Righteous person for every 561 dead Jews in Ukraine. [Ukraine never conducted](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/nazi-hunters-give-low-grades-to-13-countries-inclu-94616.html) an investigation of a local Nazi war criminal or prosecution of a Holocaust perpetrator. As described [here](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20130500-holocaust-in-ukraine.pdf), collaboration occurred plenty. Saying ""others did it too"" is irrelevant. Zelensky portrayed Ukraine as some savior of Jews during the Holocaust, which ignores the fact that far more of Ukraine collaborated and helped carry it out. On page 144 of that monograph, for example, witnesses describe how an ""enthused mob"" of Ukrainians murdered and ""brutalized"" local Jews 3 days after the Nazis arrived, burning and plundering Jews' homes. As one witness recounted:

&gt;The participation of Ukrainians in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews
is beyond any dispute…. At the German invasion, they themselves initiated
terrible massacres in comparison to which even the cruelty of the Germans
seemed pallid. It is a fact that the Germans took pictures of Jews being hurled
into the flames of burning houses. In Przemyslany the perpetrators of this were
the Ukrainians. Had they been allowed, they would even today cut down the
entire ghetto in their passion for plunder.

I mean, it doesn't get more clear than that. Testimony after testimony shows the enthusiasm with which Ukrainians, free to finally kill their Jewish neighbors and take their things, did so when the Germans arrived. Then the Soviets swept it under the rug, pretended it never happened, and until the Soviet Union fell, we didn't even have an accurate measure of the extent of deaths, let alone collaboration, in Ukraine.",68ad7946872454a8af5f46fb38f952ba5074a16c,True,False,,,,,0,1648090668,,0,{},i1vv41w,False,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t1_i1vty6t,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i1vv41w/,1648090689,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648061868.0,

It's literally a call for repatriation, i.e. return.

There is no reason to say you *regret* the lack of repatriation if you're not calling for it. That's absurd.

And calling it ""gaslighting"" is equally absurd.

&gt;the world at large has been calling for Israel to either respect that right of the refugees to return or negotiate reparations with them in exchange for them ceding that right

The world has called for compensation for lost territory. Ironically, the world doesn't call for the larger number of Jews displaced from the Arab world (who also lost land equal to 5x the size of Israel, and far more property) to also get compensation.

Even so, that's not the same as a call for *repatriation* or *return*, which the resolution literally includes.

&gt;The Israeli government has never been willing to accept responsibility for driving those refugees into exile though

The Israeli government has [literally agreed to offer compensation](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-200101/) for the refugees and descendants of this war **that Palestinian leaders openly admit they began**.

Have the Palestinian government, and all various Arab governments, ever agreed to compensation for the larger number of displaced Jews? Just wondering, since we're talking about responsibility.

&gt;hence has never made an honest effort to negotiate compensation and instead falsely accuses the world of being bent on Israel's destruction

1) You're literally talking about a resolution that ""regrets"" the lack of repatriation, i.e. calls for such ""return"" and destruction of Israel.

2) Israel has offered [to contribute to a $30 billion](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-204899/) international fund for refugees caused by a war Palestinians began.

3) The only side refusing compensation is the Arab one. Jews lost over $100 billion in property and land, and zero compensation has ever been offered. When Israel brought up that said $30 billion fund, offered in 2000, would include Jews, the Palestinians said they refuse to let Jewish ""immigrants"" mix with Palestinian ""refugees"", ignoring and denying Jewish refugeehood and *actually* refusing to take responsibility, precisely what you (falsely) accuse Israel of.

&gt;And navigating from from this page you can find all the General Assembly resolutions see their vote totals, those regarding Israel, Palestine, and otherwise. The main one is called Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine, that link going to the most recent version, and neither it nor any other call for Israel's destruction. The entire notion that the UN calls for the destruction of any UN Member State should be utterly absurd on its face to anyone, but again unfortunately many people have been gaslighted into imagining otherwise.

The UN General Assembly is calling for a policy that *sounds* nice, but would replace Israel with Palestine. It's not ""absurd"", and claiming it's ""gaslighting"" ignores that the literal text you quoted says what you're trying to claim it doesn't. The UN has also called Zionism, the belief that Israel should exist, ""racist"". Thank you for demonstrating, I guess, that the UN treats Israel uniquely. Given 20 condemnations or so are filed each year of Israel, compared to less than 10 for the rest of the world combined many years, I think that's also obvious to anyone with eyes.

Plus you went on to state blatant falsehoods about Israel's positions on the refugees caused by the Palestinian decision to go to war in 1947-49.

If you check the document /u/HariSeldonOlivaw linked you see that unlike what they claim, the word *return* doesn't even appear in the document at all. The synonym *repatriation* is in the resolution, but there's no demand for the refugees to return, and rather what [the document](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N21/387/68/PDF/N2138768.pdf?OpenElement) actually says is:

&gt;Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution [194 \(III\)](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/PDF/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement), has not yet been effected, and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to be a matter of grave concern and the Palestine refugees continue to require assistance to meet basic health, education and living needs

That's the situation, since all the way back in 1949 when UNGA 194 was passed, the world at large has been calling for Israel to either respect that right of the refugees to return or negotiate reparations with them in exchange for them ceding that right.  The Israeli government has never been willing to accept responsibility for driving those refugees into exile though, hence has never made an honest effort to negotiate compensation and instead falsely accuses the world of being bent on Israel's destruction.

In other words, ""yeah, I thought tons of cops were killed in the Capitol riot (because that's what the news told me) before you forced me to look it up, but I don't want to say so despite the truth being obvious from my previous comments"". Eh, I'll take it.

&gt;&gt;Had the Capitol Police demonstrated their ability and willingness to use their tools (including weapons) at hand, much/all of the chaos might have been avoided in the first place

&gt;So, in your mind, the Capitol Police should've opened fire en masse and killed or wounded hundreds of people? That would have been a reasonable response to charging the barricades?

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Following the normal deescalation procedures for such a circumstance (verbal warnings, warning shots, etc.), yes. *Absolutely* yes, once serious violence began. Hundreds of people would not actually have been wounded or killed (we know this, because we know that, again, only one rioter was ultimately killed). But if necessary, in the horrible circumstance in which those in front are shot/killed but the 140 behind them won't stop their single-minded intent to Overthrow the Government of the United States^(TM), yes. (See below.)

Third answer: Yes, as you'd have known had you actually paid attention to what I've been saying since the beginning.

&gt;The insurrectionists on January 6th attempted to overturn the results of a lawful democratic process through violence and intimidation.

So, let me get this straight:

* 150 rioters who caused chaos, assaulted law-enforcement officers, but didn't actually kill anyone are ""insurrectionists"" who were barely stopped from overthrowing the entire United States government (despite the law and Constitution not actually, you know, working that way)

* ... yet don't merit said officers using the weapons and training they were given to prevent said ""insurrectionists"" from assaulting their own selves, let alone the chaos they caused.

PS - As I pointed out earlier, during the 1968 riots in DC after MLK's assassination, active-duty troops manned machine gun batteries on the Capitol steps. Were they there just for funsies?

The point was violence and remains violence. The point was to establish that it's hard to argue ""they were invited"" after you're confronted with all the cases of assaults on police. And I didn't even touch on the rampant damage to property or the looting, both things that also further undermine your narrative of ""they were invited.""

So, in your mind, the Capitol Police should've opened fire en masse and killed or wounded hundreds of people? That would have been a reasonable response to charging the barricades? 

That's an interestingly authoritarian position. Does your criticism extend to those who incited such behavior? What about the people that deliberately failed to dispatch the various National Guards available to support the Capitol Police? Because from where I'm sitting, it seems like those folks are just as culpable as the most radical elements at the Capitol that. I'm pretty sure I know your opinion on this, though. 

&gt; Good lord. Just how many race-and-culture classes did you take in college?

I'm aware this is a disingenuous question, but because I find your take amusing: zero. I graduated before my alma mater even had an inclusivity office. 

&gt; You call a mob who trespass into the Capitol and for a few hours demonstrate ""riotous behavior"" but don't kill anyone ""insurrectionists"". But you also say that calling the nationwide, days- and weeks-long frenzy of rioting, looting, and violence that directly caused the absence of governmental authority in substantial chunks of several cities, and actually directly killed people after the death of George Floyd ""Floyd riots"", is a ""dogwhistle"". Got it.

There's a lot to unpack here, but I'll try.

* The insurrectionists on January 6th attempted to overturn the results of a lawful democratic process through violence and intimidation. What's fortunate for them is that they were *at* the Capitol. Because otherwise they meet all the classic definitions of terrorism: using violence or the threat of violence to effect change (usually political) from people not at the immediate site of the action. 

* The repeated attempts on your part to equate BLM protests and riots is the dogwhistle. I'm not sure why that's so hard for you to understand. The protests were the people petitioning the government for a redress of grievances. That phrase might be familiar to you. 

* BLM and related organizations have repeatedly and emphatically criticized the rioters. They're clearly not the same groups. If some less scrupulous people used BLM as a cover to riot and/or loot, that doesn't tarnish BLM with the same brush. Do you believe that all the insurrectionists were part of the most extreme groups that showed up? Do we equate the people grinning like idiots in photo ops in the Capitol with the guys that showed up with plate carriers and had coordinated plans to smuggle arms into the area? Because if you're equating BLM with sporadic rioting, then you have to also consider everyone at the Capitol to be directly affiliated with the Proud Boys or similar groups that operated there. And I don't think you're quite willing to make that leap.",b6998cb60554d181d6358b930c8a980c7fb02062,True,False,,,,,0,1648085066,,0,{},i1vj42x,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1uyflv,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1vj42x/,1648085078,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648056266.0,

What about, for example, if what's preventing you from buying a car, isn't the government, but your own financial situation? By this I mean, a person from a third world country(not China) cannot afford a car even if the government isn't limiting their choices.

China's social credits(in certain places) does limit car ownership, due to age, family makeup and more, but it also created the infrastructure to go about your daily life relatively easily.

""He said Israel should help Ukraine because Ukraine helped Jews during the Holocaust, why would it be relevant that far more Ukrainians collaborated with the Holocaust than rescued Jews?""

Do you hear your own argument?

&gt;especially coming from a Jewish man

This is the worst possible argument. Jews can engage in Holocaust denial, especially soft Holocaust denial. It happens all the time. Jews have literally written Holocaust denial books. Zelensky is framing stuff the way the Soviets have taught it for decades, and which is still very well ingrained in Ukrainian thought, as numerous scholars have pointed out. The Soviets suppressed and destroyed evidence of Ukraine's collaboration in the Holocaust for literally decades.

Not to mention comparing this war, however bad, to the Holocaust...is a form of soft denial too. It is a minimization by comparison. It's like comparing the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to a school shooting. They're both bad, but they are not the same in scale, and it minimizes the atomic bombs to make that inane comparison.",feeefe9fd9f827f0e01d19960fa2328ec3ac698e,True,False,,,,,0,1648080630,,0,{},i1v94h9,False,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t1_i1us47a,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i1v94h9/,1648080647,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648051830.0,
