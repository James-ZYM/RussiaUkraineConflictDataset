I understand the fears of NATO but also a part of me deep inside feels like it’s seriously the right thing to do to pound Russia’s military into the dirt in a matter of days if not hours and obliterate the kremlin so the people can take charge of their own country.

But I know it would also not be so simple. Putin is safe in his bidet-hole, and as long as there are those who remain loyal to him he will continue to disseminate false news reports and use fear to control the large percentage of Russians who believe the propaganda.

Is that really the solution when dealing with a nostalgic, desperate madman? Yet again, how does such a person hold so strong influence over the fears of the rest of the world?

NATO has the power to prevent very likely any further innocent deaths in Ukraine. No doubt Zelenskyy is aware of the complexities of the matter, but it seems he and Ukraine are of the kind who think “whatever the consequences, it is more important to do the right thing.”

It is also an easy position to take when you are the one who is desperate for help—what else can you do but plead to those who have the power, when the enemy is so easily and ruthlessly killing your beloved people?

Our disagreement stems from our appreciation of the power and ramifications of the propaganda.

They are brainwashed and don’t have a clear idea of what’s going on. The people in Germany didn’t want to believe what hitler had done either, they had to visit the concentration camps in order to understand that reality.

Propaganda is really the problem here, for someone like you or me who (I assume) come from democratic nations, it is difficult to tell because from the outside looking in, Russia really seems like a democracy with some level of corruption.

It is not. Having family and friends there (from different generations) I am lucky to see that they are so brainwashed that they will allow their government to hurt their loved ones thinking it is helping them instead.

For instance, even Russians who have been living in a true democracy like Spain or Italy for 10-15 years, still believe in Putin propaganda, either fully or to a degree. You know why? Because they can’t bring themselves to accept that they have been lied to about everything for the past 30+ years.

I can only encourage you to learn more about the insidious impacts propaganda has on people, passing off judgement on Russians without understanding that crucial element is akin to judge a fish for not being able to climb a wall. 

**Understand who they are and then judge them for that.**

I had heard that part of the reason the Russians haven't been able to bring their reputedly advanced air force to bear on Ukraine to the extent that western analysts expected is that they used up too many of their advanced munitions (missiles, precision bombs) in Syria, and because of this, they didn't want to risk their most advanced planes in low flying dumb-bomb dropping operations.

&gt; And what, for example, is a massive fire strike (MO[U?]) of the front? To begin with, we note that the maximum number of combat-ready forces and means of aviation, missile troops and artillery, electronic warfare equipment at the disposal of the commander of the front forces (operational-strategic formation) is involved in the MOU. The MOU consists of one massive air sortie, two or three launches of OTP and TR missile systems, and several artillery fire raids. Well, if the degree of fire damage to the enemy is 60-70%.

&gt; What is the most important thing in this matter in relation to the conflict with Ukraine? Of course, the MOU will inflict heavy losses on a potential enemy. But to expect to crush the armed forces of an entire state with just one such blow means to show simply unbridled optimism in the course of planning and conducting combat operations. In the course of hypothetical strategic actions on the theater of operations, such MOUs will have to be applied not one or two, but much more.

States would be levelling us to the ground in seconds, and nothing remotely like that would ever happen cause everyone knows that would happen.  

And the states lost some thousands to islamic terrorists, russia lost 20-27 million people during WWII while US lost like 300k and has never been invaded themselves, except by themselves.  States would be extra pissed if we invited china, or any other country according to the monroe doctrine, legally to help bolster national security.  Not that it would happen obviously cause Canada knows it would not be a pleasant experience.

No one would be charged with war crimes due to the American Service members Protection Act.  It is American policy to use any means neccessary and appropriate to ensure no US or allied soldiers or officials are tried under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  It prevents handing over evidence and extradition to the ICC.  In short, the US does not accept international standards of accountability for war crimes they have committed,  while simultaneously supporting their efforts against other countries.  Thus it shouldnt be a suprise to anyone when the Russians refuse to comply with the ICC, because US policy has made it perfectly clear that it does not apply universally.

US has a long history of not respecting the sovereignty of other nations, see Latin America.  It is why bananas are the cheapest fruit in America despite being imported.  And has laid the foundation for American Multinationals and thus the vast amounts of wealth possesed by the states.  So my problem is less with criticizing Russia and more regarding the exceptionalist nonsense while being completely ignorant to the American role in maintaining the political climate where this stuff happens, instead of promoting and strengthening institutions which could provide an avenue for universal justice in international politics.  

Israel had been getting US support for how long?  They justify their nonsensical 2000 year old reclaim casus belli, but they are no better than the russians, they are just not doing things to Europeans, considering that Donbas was owned by ukrainian cossacks and lost to turks, russia took donbas and crimea from turks, and the cossack hetmanate eventually eventually requested to be a subject of Russia because they were threatened by the Poles.  But when palestinans engage in urban warfare they are said to be using human shields and innocent people killed are written off as collateral damage.  Canadas largest weapons deal was made to saudi arabia who has been bombing civilians in yemen for a long time.  Saudis are not a democracy, so thats not what things are about.  Worst humanitarian crisis on earth for years and no international effort or attention other than picking a side and bombing the people they dont agree with.  

There needs to be cooperation between nations even if they fundamentally disagree or else we will never have any hope of finding peace on this planet.

Hidden factions among those who dwell with the Father for those that have sought their solace and their company for the weary and the valiant. Halls of intriguing creatures, alien and angelic, and sometimes in powerful yet caring forms, peaceful baths, warm fires, and strong drink. Riddles of life are answered there and a paltry minute can steady the soul from its worries for any challenge for years to come. But the last time I was there, I was told they did not expect me so soon, and yet, I was not denied the benefits of that mysterious lodge. I might not have known if these are but reassuring illusions or some glimpse of a place that seems a mix of Heaven and Valhalla's pleasures, save for the epiphanies that only come through the basking of absolute knowledge and peace and to look with unfettered eyes again at the world and see where favor lies. But who would believe me? If your soul does not seek adventure and justice by day and if your heart does not seek high affections and healing libations by night, then why would you have seen it? I cannot blame them for this. Who else has seen these draconic Valkyrie? These reptilian angels in maidens' garbs with foaming steins, their halos and wings aglow in unexpected holy lights; they would be misunderstood. Who else can bear to witness their mightiest mortal translation in to such images we have long saved for relating to sin and the slay-worthy? Perhaps few are ready for such gnostic insight. Perhaps it is their hidden weapon against the greatest evils. But I believe only those who are haunted by the worst of monsters need such consolation that more fearsome and lovely spirits yet champion their cause. For the eagle's wings can only raise you up, but once you are there, feathers fail and ancient scales will shield you from the weight of fiendish devices.

&gt; The war&amp;#039;s economic and geopolitical shockwaves - with soaring energy prices, fears for global food supplies, and Russia and China aligning in a new world order with Cold War echoes - have reverberated across a planet yet to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.
