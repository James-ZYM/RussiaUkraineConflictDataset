Bolton thinks putin didn't attack during Trump first term because he thought he could win again and, once a second term president not op for re election, he would leave NATO. I think that's possible.

The press is being lazy defining the difference between a regular old public health lab and a biological weapons research program.  Which has allowed these conspiracy theories to flourish.

Here are Russian supporters Rubio and Tucker tag teaming the same propaganda thread. That putin is pushing. (this is from Tucker transcript so the beginning are quotes)

VICTORIA NULAND, U.S. UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS: Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact, we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

&gt;  
&gt;Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Monday that his southern Russian region would not be able to survive a month without Moscow’s multi-billion-dollar subsidies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kadyrov estimated that Russian handouts in Chechnya total 300 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) a year. According to the RBC news website, Moscow’s grants and subsidies to the republic of Chechnya totaled 125.6 billion rubles ($1.6 billion) in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I swear to the almighty Allah, we won’t be able to last three months — not even a month” without Russia's financial backing, Kadyrov said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We won’t survive without Russia,” he added in a live social media stream shared by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kadyrov said he “also wanted an independent Ichkeria,” referring to the Chechen secessionist government that Moscow waged two bloody wars against in the 1990s and early 2000s.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the Chechen strongman stressed that his region has “no gas, no electricity, no oil” that would allow it to secede from Russia.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve been looking for seven years, but I can’t find a single investor to handle the refinery,” Kadyrov said. “If anyone offers us something else, let them write an economic model for us.”",02cfb86e7995f4e13a6bc775836dc2d07134fded,True,False,,,,,0,1647346130,,0,{},i0qn64k,False,t3_tdsivt,False,True,t1_i0okduy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tdsivt/calls_in_georgia_to_retake_south_ossetia_from/i0qn64k/,1647346145,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647317330.0,

Ask where NATO is?  The largest most powerful force and its not stopping Putin They no stopping Putin now is the best option… Ukraine is his taster meal before Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, the Former States of Yugoslavia.  He’ll always wave his nukes!!!

Tell NATO to stop hiding behind its Article 5. To stop hiding behind national interests for fuel from Russia.

Remind NATO Member States they are all member states of the UN and it’s Charter. Russia has committed the most flagrant breach of this Charter! Article 51 of this Charter allows states like Ukraine to protect its integrity AND for coalitions of member states to support such states against violation, that’s what Ukraine is asking NATO member states to do. Show letters you’ve sent asking, pleading with NATO member states to adopt an immediate response, to work within their NATO framework to fight and defeat ALL Russian forces in Ukraine, forcing them out of Ukraine. The World needs to know NATO has been asked and has so far failed to uphold the UN Charter!!!!! The global risks of such behaviour will unravel our world

We need change. **BADLY.** That much is painfully obvious.

But that change is not going to happen by just accepting humanity in its horrific state and succumbing to our own despair.

Yes if you put your tin foil hat on and get a little conspiratorial, one can argue America fucks up a lot when it comes to foreign intervention. But my point in reminding the world of the OEF coalitions is that it is not just America who does this. Foreign intervention happens everyday, we know this. 

But normalizing recent behaviors perpetrated by the Russians is everything wrong with war. I may be willing to press a red button but some people here and the greater part of the world it seems are okay with civilians waving white flags getting bombed. It wasn't cool when the west did it and it's sure as hell not cool when Russia does it. 

Staying critical of any event such as the bombing of innocent civilians regardless of who did it is what I stand for (so for anyone asking yes I don't support a few instances of foreign intervention perpetrated by my government). And I urge others to do the same. Even in war, the shit we have all seen IRL, in the news, etc. as of late should incite anyone with a heart to stand up physically and verbally against these war crimes regardless of outcome. 

Putin needs to realize he isn't the only crazy person in the world and I thank Ukraine and it's people for showing the world they won't stand for this shit. As an American I want my government to physically intervene.

&gt; Just before 11 a.m. Moscow Standard Time on March 1, after a night of Russian strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, a set of Russian-language Twitter accounts spread a lie that Ukraine was fabricating civilian casualties.

&gt; The Twitter profiles are part of a pro-Putin network of dozens of accounts spread across Twitter, TikTok and Instagram whose behavior, content and coordination are consistent with Russian troll factory the Internet Research Agency, according to Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor who, along with another professor, Patrick Warren, has spent years studying IRA accounts.

&gt; Multiple Twitter accounts, for example, shared a screenshot of a Russian actor&amp;#039;s tweet that he cared more about being able to use Apple Pay than the war in Ukraine.

[],False,,DadJokesAndMore,,,[],,,,text,t2_14k5kfo1,False,False,"There is a lot to unpack here, so I give you some personal views as a white, South African, male. This is observations and some opinion, I did not ever and have never made or enforced laws in any country.

I was a teenager in this time of sanctions, in South Africa. I grew up in a middle class, white family, born mid-70s.

From a teenager's point of view, not much changed life as we knew it already, since being far away physically we were already used to paying high prices on imported goods and back then, the international economies were not so interconnected. We were watching movies that had been released years before anyway and there was no global stores like Amazon or PayPal to help you buy anything directly, so I guess back then sanctions were more of a worry for business and govt. ...and people employed by business and govt.

Sanctions definitely worked, but so did a movement of yearning for... ...something else. People were tired, disillusioned and the veneer was starting to peel off the government. Hatred can be tiring, I guess.

The sanctions messed with the economy and ultimately the cashflow the government depends on for their hate machine. South Africa situation was unique too: Don't forget in that time, non-white people outnumbered white people almost 10 to 1 and most of those ten did not get living standards at all; if companies closed or stopped to pay wages, things would get ugly really fast.

The govt at the time decided to go for a transition of power rather than massive violence which was almost a certainty. There was a referendum, if I recall, to vote for 'should we try to work it out' or 'business as usual' in the early nineties (I have some doubts about this memory). I think they got the message and tried to work something out.

The government is still corrupt as fuck, though, its still money and talking and not much more. Sanctions is a good first step to force a hand, as pointed out in other comments; the body guards and police need to get paid and the money has to be worth the risk. The businesses need security guarantees and supplies of willing workers that can be paid meaningfully otherwise everything stops including the support for the decisions makers. The governments listen to big businesses more than the workers.",0c5a32e71f23477295a7f429286060674cc5411a,True,False,,,,,0,1647291274,,0,{},i0nyrpb,False,t3_tckmep,False,True,t3_tckmep,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tckmep/again_i_need_someones_anyones_help_in/i0nyrpb/,1647291290,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647262474.0,

There are 195 countries on the planet, back then it was give or take a few, but I'm pretty sure the number of participants in OEF was in the low 60s. Similarly, many nations abstained from voting to get involved in sanctions against Russia. I'm not mentioning this to correct you so much as to suggest that there isn't necessarily this unifying outrage as you imagine. There are countries all over the world who don't even have tight controls on media and where the populations tend to support Russia because they believe the propaganda, even when presented with the facts side by side.

Anyway, I understand you don't think this is anything the same as what's happened before. Heck, I was even trying to tell my girlfriend this the other day when she asked if this was any different than how we have done nothing to get Israel to stop killing and destroying the Palestinians. No way, it's totally different. Yet... at the same time... she has a point, and so does u/cc81. The truth is, even the ""good guys"" have done some despicable things. It's usually not \*systemic\*, but some rogue unit or panicking soldiers who decide to just shoot everybody. Trust me, it's happened. And at the same time, I'm willing to bet there are a ton of Russian troops who are not interested in killing innocent people. The Russian military is a clusterf\*ck right now and they've got conscripts and ex-felons who have no idea what they're doing and shoot at everything that moves because they don't want to die. This isn't meant to defend them. It's just a reality of war. 

Still, as horrible as this is, without us being able to control the amount of death and pain, it's better than forcing billions to go through the same thing in a slow and agonizing fashion.

For some reason I'm immediately reminded of what Morgan Freeman's character says to the White Power guy in American History X: ""has anything you've done made your life better?""

It's horrible what Putin's regime has done.

It would be way worse, the pain and horrors to come, if we retaliated with actions that led to nuclear war.

There is a philosophical exercise which is becoming more popular lately, one where you are a train switchman. There is a runaway train and no ability to brake, so all you can do is switch the train from one track to the other. The problem is that on one track is a child and on the other track there are several adults. You have to choose. The brakemen are further down past the tracks, so the only thing you can do is decide which track the runaway train goes on.

We don't have any control over Putin. We really don't. And Putin has spent 22 years insulating himself from assassination attempts and coups. The Russian people don't want to die and most of them don't want to kill anybody either, but they're surrounded by media convincing them that Putin just wants what's best for all slavic peoples.

But we \*do\* have some control over just how much death occurs. Right now we and most of the world are supporting Ukraine, and every single day we do, the number of deaths goes up. If the world stopped supporting Ukraine, the war probably would be over last week. 

That doesn't mean we shouldn't support Ukraine. It really is important to make this as painful as possible for the Russians.

It's important because the alternatives are doing nothing (which means people will die anyway), or doing much worse (nuclear... where even more people die).

The choice is pretty simple. We stay the course and do everything we can short of starting a nuclear war. Why? Because all death is intolerable, but we have to choose the least amount to be as effective as possible. That's the only moral imperative here.",38648613e480ba0bd0f1d06e8c1d953edf71a2f4,True,False,,,,,0,1647280547,,0,{},i0n7b5l,False,t3_tdwt87,False,True,t1_i0mxczc,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tdwt87/dad_and_son_ambushed_by_russian_soldiers_with_3/i0n7b5l/,1647280566,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647251747.0,

It is unfortunately the reality of war and something that has most likely happened every year you have been on this earth. It is horrible.

What I will post now is not a comparison of conflicts as I do think that the US intervention against IS was a very good thing (Iraq is another story). But just to show that even when a military is completely overwhelmingly powerful and not inefficient and bogged down in fighting in cities like the Russian one, war is incredibly brutal.

&gt;In the last days of the battle against the Islamic State in Syria, when members of the once-fierce caliphate were cornered in a dirt field next to a town called Baghuz, a U.S. military drone circled high overhead, hunting for military targets. But it saw only a large crowd of women and children huddled against a river bank.

&gt;Without warning, an American F-15E attack jet streaked across the drone’s high-definition field of vision and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the crowd, swallowing it in a shuddering blast. As the smoke cleared, a few people stumbled away in search of cover. Then a jet tracking them dropped one 2,000-pound bomb, then another, killing most of the survivors.

&gt;It was March 18, 2019. At the U.S. military’s busy Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, uniformed personnel watching the live drone footage looked on in stunned disbelief, according to one officer who was there.

&gt;“Who dropped that?” a confused analyst typed on a secure chat system being used by those monitoring the drone, two people who reviewed the chat log recalled. Another responded, “We just dropped on 50 women and children.”

&gt;An initial battle damage assessment quickly found that the number of dead was actually about 70.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/us/us-airstrikes-civilian-deaths.html

That is war. When the US helped SDF to take back Raqqah and Iraqi security forces to take back Mosul those were incredibly brutal fights in cities. Again the cause was just but that does not help innocent civilians that die. The bombings of those cities were more intense and brutal than anything that has happened in this war so far.
