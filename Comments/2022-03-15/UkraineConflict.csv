And I feel the other guy who understandably doesn't want to die a horrific death in nuclear fire and neither do I.

We need change. **BADLY.** That much is painfully obvious. And I don't know how that change is gonna come, be it from human expansion into space, new geopolitical treaties, the working class finally overthrowing these assholes once and for all and implementing a new socioeconomic normal that involves dismantling every single last nuke and launching all of the uranium into the fucking Sun, I don't know. 

But that change is not going to happen by just accepting humanity in its horrific state and succumbing to our own despair.

If we want to fix the unholy mess we're in, we have to get out and talk to people and do it. Build a new way. Stick to it despite the odds. 

Please don't give up on yourself, and most of all please don't give up on humanity.

Don't give in to your demons and support burning the world in nuclear fire.

Don't give in to the other guy's demons and support imprisoning the world in hellish tyranny, forever to subsist as a slave with a nuclear gun pointed to its head.

He’ll always wave his nukes!!!

Tell NATO to stop hiding behind its Article 5. To stop hiding behind national interests for fuel from Russia.

Remind NATO Member States they are all member states of the UN and it’s Charter. Russia has committed the most flagrant breach of this Charter! Article 51 of this Charter allows states like Ukraine to protect its integrity AND for coalitions of member states to support such states against violation, that’s what Ukraine is asking NATO member states to do. Show letters you’ve sent asking, pleading with NATO member states to adopt an immediate response, to work within their NATO framework to fight and defeat ALL Russian forces in Ukraine, forcing them out of Ukraine. The World needs to know NATO has been asked and has so far failed to uphold the UN Charter!!!!! The global risks of such behaviour will unravel our world

&gt;  
&gt;Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Monday that his southern Russian region would not be able to survive a month without Moscow’s multi-billion-dollar subsidies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kadyrov estimated that Russian handouts in Chechnya total 300 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) a year. According to the RBC news website, Moscow’s grants and subsidies to the republic of Chechnya totaled 125.6 billion rubles ($1.6 billion) in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I swear to the almighty Allah, we won’t be able to last three months — not even a month” without Russia's financial backing, Kadyrov said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We won’t survive without Russia,” he added in a live social media stream shared by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kadyrov said he “also wanted an independent Ichkeria,” referring to the Chechen secessionist government that Moscow waged two bloody wars against in the 1990s and early 2000s.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the Chechen strongman stressed that his region has “no gas, no electricity, no oil” that would allow it to secede from Russia.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve been looking for seven years, but I can’t find a single investor to handle the refinery,” Kadyrov said. “If anyone offers us something else, let them write an economic model for us.”",02cfb86e7995f4e13a6bc775836dc2d07134fded,True,False,,,,,0,1647346130,,0,{},i0qn64k,False,t3_tdsivt,False,True,t1_i0okduy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tdsivt/calls_in_georgia_to_retake_south_ossetia_from/i0qn64k/,1647346145,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647317330.0,,,,

Bolton thinks putin didn't attack during Trump first term because he thought he could win again and, once a second term president not op for re election, he would leave NATO. I think that's possible. There could be tons of other reasons though including shoring up support at home or whatever else.

There are many factors to consider on this. 

1. The value of all the buildings and land that the US government owns. That in itself is an enormous sum that can be borrowed against or sold as needed. 

2. The incredible value of I.P. that the US owns. This can be monetized in multiple ways as needed. 

3. The value of national parks. This would be an unusual move, but they could be leased out to private entities to monetize. 

The net value of the things that the US Government owns is many times more than the national debt. 


There is also other factors to consider; inflation &amp; GDP increase.

As a country, the longer you hold debt, the less it costs you because of inflation and increased GDP.

Let's say that inflation is on average 2% per year in the US, that means that the true cost of the national debt reduces by 2% per year even if they do nothing but pay the interest. It may not sound like much but that combined with GDP increase is how many countries paid off their massive debts from WW2. 

Example; Canada had enormous debts after WW2 that were worth many times more than their annual GDP. 

Back in 1945 a billion dollars was an unthinkable amount of money. Today a billion dollars is pretty much chump change for governments. 

Over the next 50 years they paid the interest and a small amount of the principal and by the time they paid it off, it was worth just a tiny fraction of the country's GDP. 

That's a very short and simplified version of why national debt can't be looked at in the same way that personal debt is. The media hype is total BS because they don't understand how it works.

That would be amazing to see an actual report in the net worth of everything the US Government owns. It would be nearly impossible because a lot of it is subjective until you actually go to sell it but an estimation would be really cool. 

For instance, if the government decided to sell Yellowstone National park....what is it worth? (Yes I know it would be impossible with public outcry but just hypothetical)
No single private entity is going to buy the whole thing, so you have to subdivide it...how much is each section worth, how many sections are there in total...etc. And that's just one national park!

Humanitarian aid has been withheld, humanitarian convoys attacked, humanitarian corridors suspended and then attacked. civilians have been besieged to stave of freeze to death. Protected persons have been “disappeared” by Russian military. 

All of the above are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. In an army that is commanded by Putin. He is ultimately responsible for these operational policies and practices.

The fact that this has been so widespread and systematic shows it’s no rogue commander or rogue troops - it’s all of them. It’s a function of command to control forces. At the very best Putin has failed to control them, but that is Al highly unlikely and unrealistic. Putin has directed these policies and practices and encouraged atrocities. He and his command chain have committed war crimes and have to be held accountable.

As to why Putin has done this? He is desperate to subjugate Ukraine and ran out of time, money, troops and political “friends” so he’s resorting to more and more extreme measures to break the relentless Ukraine spirit to be free and independent.
