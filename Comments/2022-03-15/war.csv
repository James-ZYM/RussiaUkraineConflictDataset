Attacks in the USA and Europe have been linked to terrorists who have had trained in the Azov battalion before committing these acts. Wanted criminals go from European countries to Europe to continue supporting their beliefs. Nazi beliefs, if you will.

This war is way more complicated than you think it is, neither I or you are capable of making decisions about it. You may call Putin a “nazi” (ironic as hell, makes you seem dumb and uninformed) but many others, including my grandma and my family that is currently in Trieschyna, Kiev, believe that Zelensky is a corrupt clown who acts like he’s in a movie for the west, instead of either surrendering or making talks about a coalition to take down the Azov, since they’re the bad guy. But I doubt he’s foggy vision will ever allow him to do that. He was a comedian, has zero experience when it comes to politics and war and people defend him by saying that his grandpa was a jew. So fucking what lol? All the grandpas of these Azov scums were Soviets who were dying for the freedom of the Soviet Union and todays Ukraine. So what?

A Russian motor-rifle battalion has like 300 men, and from what I know, rule of thumb for Russian brigades is that they always have only one infantry regiment (generally 3, sometimes 2 battalions) . 

Of course they would have their tank battalion, 2 artillery battalions, one MLRS battalion, the engineer battalion and the anti aircraft battalion, but those are generally significantly smaller than infantry battalions (an armored battalion is closer to 100 men) . 

Averaging them at 200 men per battalion you get around 1800 men.

Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey). Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press).

For the period from 1994 to 2009, estimates ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 civilians and 10,000 to 50,000 Russian servicemen killed.

[],False,,BrahimBug,,,[],,,,text,t2_5u8u2,False,False,"Sorry but I disagree. I refuse to buy Russian propaganda because I learnt to how to identify it from American propaganda over the last 2 decades.

All those things you said about Afghanistan and Iraq is the same thing as Putin saying ""we are fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine."" You are completely ignorant of the long history of U.S. and Russian involvement in Afghanistan and the hand they played in turning those nations into fragmented failed states. The Taliban was armed by the U.S. to fight Russia... ISIS was armed by the U.S. to fight the Syrian Govt... 

The media printed the propaganda provided by the CIA, with no attempt to challenge it. There no point in trying to convince you because you have already made your mind up.

I stand with the Ukrainian people because I do not want to see Ukraine destroyed like the other countries I have witnessed in my lifetime.

Because I, an Iraqi, who hated also hated Saddam, can look at the fact that before the 2003 invasion there were 0 suicide bombing and 0 car bombing in Iraq, and realize that the U.S. invasion was not for the benefit of the people or Iraq. Also, I am half Kurdish, the people gassed by Saddam Hussein. He was an evil piece of shit but the U.S. is not better. That is just fact whether you like it or not. I refuse to ignore one evil just because another evil exists.

I do not want the people of Ukraine to experience the same thing that my parents experienced. That my wife's family, who is Yemeni, is currently experiencing in Yemen under the brutal invasion by Saudi, with U.S. approval and weapons.

What I see is 2 superpowers fighting for their own interests, and the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle. I know how important it is to stand up for the Ukrainian people and challenge Russian aggression because I know first hand the terrible fate that the people of Ukraine are facing.

I said ""resist"" like Vietnam - as in I hope the people of Ukraine make Russia's military suffer the way the Vietcong made the U.S. military suffer.

I am not here to debate which wars are justified and which are not, I am here to explain my view that the ""whataboutism"" is not a contest, but an equivalation. I am against Superpowers invading poorer, smaller nations because we can look at Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen as say ""Holy shit we must stop this or Ukraine will end up the same.""",973cfd3ae93a685c313cecf18afe6d5b523c9aff,True,False,,,,,0,1647289629,,0,{},i0nulya,False,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0nher9,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0nulya/,1647289645,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647260829.0

Most armies don't. They'll generally have *guards*, but those are for security, not offense. *Specifically*, most armies don't because sticking big weapons on them is itself a war crime, and draws fire. The place where you *will* see that is particularly brutal insurgencies and warlord-like paramilitaries such as are most often found in the more unstable of African nations.

Or maybe you just see anyone that opposes the US as a ""Kremlin gremlin"", You don't know how much I hate Russia for you to even say that.

You're not directly, which is better than the others that shamelessly defined the warcrimes but your entire argument of ""nOw iS nOt tHe tImE"" is respectfully bs. Same thing was said when ISIS was around and the US were bombing urban areas at the same time they used the same dead argument. Goldstein maybe a real person but he's not as big of threat. Thought you guys learned that along time ago.

&gt;whataboutism is so goddamn annoying because whenever anyone brings up whataboutism, it's mainly to justify and defend who is doing the bad at the moment.

You guys never get tired of throwing that buzzword everywhere? you know what? if you have only said ""yes what US did bad and we will make sure Russia doesn't do it too"" and moved on instead of starting entire shitty useless arguments, there wouldn't have been any of this you complain about.

[],False,,LystAP,,,[],,,,text,t2_11xqbz,False,False,"&gt;Fair point, this isn't to make people act surprised, this is just to show them that what they think is free media, is just stated owned behind the scenes one way or the other. The US wasn't the only hypocrite superpower to ever exist.

Hypocrisy is inevitable for all powers, because ideals often don't match with the real world. Every major political power in history has their hypocritical moments, and honesty is often unrewarded. 

&gt;I understand your point, but I disagree... I personally see war as part of humanity and not embracing and regulating it properly can lead to destruction of people who are not involved... I think that nations adopting hedonistic beliefs leads them also to care less about what the consequences of an ungoverned, unrespected war can be. Maybe a bit too idealist but that's just my opinion.

There are alternative ways to have conflict without 'warfare'. In a way, the whole 'sanctions' response is one good alternative. One nation putting their economy against others. This seems to be a route that China is aiming for and I support this method of power projection, as it encourages rivals to focus on their economies (and ideally the development of their people) as well, instead of self-destructive arms development. At some point, you'll hit a point where almost everything in your arsenal can end the world. What is best for humanity is conflict that minimizes destruction that threatens humanity. Of course, this is my opinion.

&gt;But what if these goals can be seens as.... righteous? atleast by one side.... conflicts happen when there's no other way to settle disagreements, they happen when two incompatible  philosophies clash, mostly. But warlike culture is definitely not good. I liked the idea of neutral orgs at first but then they turned out to be not so neutral. I still think we can strive to make something similar tho.

The problem with 'righteousness' is that its' relative to the culture and individual. To invade others (or generally to use violence) to spread or uphold your 'ideas' inevitably leads to a point where conflict spirals out of control since everyone has their own experiences and tries to protect or impose their version of 'righteousness' on the other. 

The situation thus far is at risk of spiraling out of control due to 'righteousness' from my perspective, in terms of on one side, a 'righteous' desire to reclaim the glories of the past against the hedonistic West, verses an 'righteous' perception that this is a democratic holy war against an autocratic invader. We aren't there yet, but there's a feeling its' heading that direction. Neither side is 'right' or 'wrong' from this perspective, but unless a compromise is reached (where no one has everything they want, but they have something), it'll keep escalating because people are still angry tribal monkeys at heart. The more this conflict continues the more polarized each side will become. 

&gt;Don't understand what you mean... if you're saying that people are free to criticize the US then you're not entirely wrong or right... there's alot of people that criticize the US and are free, there's also alot who did and got incarcerated or were in an environment where they can be killed. There was this list of people mysteriously killed after criticizing the gov... and it wasn't even about war.

It is not a cultural norm that critics disappear. If it were, then honestly Western media wouldn't be as obscenely chaotic as it is now. That we are having this discussion at all is evidence, although I do not reject the possibility that it may not be so. Things do happen, those with power/wealth can as ever freely do whatever they want.",a4503e7d7d97174a68b72743a373291af88a4d20,True,False,,,,,0,1647277120,,0,{},i0myfkt,False,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0mstsz,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0myfkt/,1647277137,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647248320.0

Fair point, this isn't to make people act surprised, this is just to show them that what they think is free media, is just stated owned behind the scenes one way or the other. The US wasn't the only hypocrite superpower to ever exist.

&gt;War itself is a crime in my opinion as is the usage of it to achieve political ends.

I understand your point, but I disagree... I personally see war as part of humanity and not embracing and regulating it properly can lead to destruction of people who are not involved... I think that nations adopting hedonistic beliefs leads them also to care less about what the consequences of an ungoverned, unrespected war can be. Maybe a bit too idealist but that's just my opinion. 

&gt;Ideally, everyone stops invading each other to achieve their goals. 

But what if these goals can be seens as.... righteous? atleast by one side.... conflicts happen when there's no other way to settle disagreements, they happen when two incompatible  philosophies clash, mostly.

&gt;But they don't usually disappear when they do that.

I don't have to say the same echo chambered sentence so I can get people to listen. Russian gov harmed the lives of people I know personally, I don't like them one bit. You being a pussy and afraid of people getting critical of your gov is not my fault, it's also not my fault alot of the Americans expected this sub to be an echo chamber.",43ac56443d8bdc9c304aee661fe47f970a0520d1,True,False,,,,,0,1647273696,,0,{},i0mpl8q,True,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0mohky,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0mpl8q/,1647273714,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647244896.0
