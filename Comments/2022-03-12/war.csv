&gt;According to author George Lepre, the total number of known and suspected fragging cases by explosives in Vietnam from 1969 to 1972 totaled nearly 900, with 99 deaths and many injuries. This total is incomplete, as some cases were not reported, nor were statistics kept before 1969 (although several incidents from 1966 to 1968 are known). Most of the victims or intended victims were officers or non-commissioned officers. The number of fraggings increased in 1970 and 1971 even though the U.S. military was withdrawing and the number of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was declining.[5]: 44–47 [8]: 155 

&gt;An earlier calculation by authors Richard A. Gabriel and Paul L. Savage, estimated that up to 1,017 fragging incidents may have taken place in Vietnam, causing 86 deaths and 714 injuries of U.S. military personnel, the majority officers and NCOs.[9]

&gt;Fragging statistics include only incidents involving explosives, most commonly grenades. Several hundred murders of U.S. soldiers by firearms occurred in Vietnam but most were of enlisted men killing other enlisted men of nearly equal rank. Fewer than 10 officers are known to have been murdered by firearms. However, rumors and claims abound of deliberate killing of officers and non-commissioned officers by enlisted men under battlefield conditions. The frequency and number of these fraggings, indistinguishable from combat deaths, cannot be quantified.[5]: 2",019580cbf57c4718fb97496c84da2f095a5d35db,True,False,,,,,0,1647128929,,0,{},i0fisux,False,t3_tcj8sb,False,True,t1_i0fhfuw,/r/war/comments/tcj8sb/russian_soldier_with_a_grenade_launcher_chained/i0fisux/,1647128945,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647100129.0,,,,

787.0,[],False,,deminion48,,,[],,,,text,t2_77xkxddb,False,False,"It is known that the DM12A0, DM22, and DM72A0 rounds were tested on actual tanks from Russia, so we know for sure they can penetrate those. It is not known what the newer DM72A1 is tested on or if it is tested at all. But logically has more performance than the old DM72 round. The only development of the Russian tanks since then are the T-72B3, T-80BVM, and T-90M/MS with Relikt ERA.

The system (trigger mechanism and scope) seems to cost nearly $10 000 and the more advanced version is just over $11 000. Each round costs around $300 (depending on the round). Not cheap for an RPG, not expensive for an AT system. The only RPG known to be similar in terms of power is the RPG-28, the strongest RPG in the ""RPG"" family. The trigger mechanism and scope are reusable multiple times, after which the scope loses zero.

The launcher is 60mm and the round is 110mm. The total system weighs around 15 to 16 kilograms, depending on the warhead. The firing unit weighs around 2.3 kilograms, the tube + warhead around 13 kilograms, and the warhead around 4 kilograms (so the tube around 9 kilograms). The system has a length of 910mm, the version with an improved tandem warhead has a collapsed tandem charge. This makes it multi-purpose, only for the heaviest targets, the tandem charge has to be extended. The range is 400 meters for stationary targets and 300 meters for moving targets. The maximum range is 920 meters and the minimum range is 20 meters. The warhead activates after 5 meters. The rocket needs 2 meters behind the operator and a space of 40 cubic meters for the backblast, as such, it can be used indoors and in confined spaces. The magnified scope is made to be easily used against Russian tanks. A night sight can be added to the system. The projectiles are rocket-assisted and generally have a velocity of around 243 m/s.

The Panzerfaust 3-IT600 was introduced as well, with the advanced dynarange scope. This is a magnified day/night sight with a targeting computer and rangefinder that calculates where to aim to effectively hit a stationary and moving target. This significantly improves the hit probability of the operator (takes away guesswork) and increases the range. The effective range with high hit probability is increased from 300 to 600 meters for moving targets and from 400 meters to 900 meters for stationary targets. This variant, together with the DM72A1, DM12A2, and DM32 rounds was initially bought by The Netherlands, together with the firing mechanism with a standard scope in 2006.

This is generally a squad-level weapon (just like how weapons like the AT-4 are used). The Dutch actually bought the Pzf 3 as a replacement for the AT-4. In The Dutch Army and Dutch Marine Corps, for example, each squad (usually 6 soldiers) has a Rifleman AT who carries the Panzerfaust 3 as their main anti-tank weapon. Multiple reloads are carried in the vehicle or carried. And then usually the Spike MR is carried on the vehicle for longer range targets (ATGM with top-attack, fire and forget, and multiple kilometers of range, generally a slightly more capable Javelin). That is the anti-tank capability of a Dutch infantry squad. Lighter systems (in The Netherlands the M72 LAW) are more sporadically carried, and more used by special forces for soft targets and quick use.

Germany uses both the variant with DynaRange and without. They also have access to the newest rounds.

Other rounds were tested as well. Like a laser homing round and a lighter variant with a 90mm round. However, these were never finished. The 90mm variant was developed to the RGW 90 (basically a more modern and capable AT-4) from the same manufacturer. They also developed the RGW 60 (60 mm) as a light RPG (basically a more modern and capable M72 LAW), just like the M72 LAW. Currently, they are developing the replacement of the Panzerfaust 3, the RGW 110. Germany and The Netherlands are working together on this as their new heavy anti-tank RPG. The difference is that it should bring better performance than the Pzf 3 and be able to circumvent APS. Seemingly, to defeat a tank like the T-14 Armata. For that, it will need even more penetration, an even better tandem charge to defeat the new ERA (Malachit), and a system to be able to deal with the APS system on the T-14 Armata (Afghanit). That's likely why the system has not been introduced yet and is still in development.

I will have a short list of comparisons here so that you can compare it with what I described above (RHA penetration/caliber/velocity/effective range/weight/cost/disposable/indoors):

Lots of nato aligned countries are pulling business out of russia, this will create an opportunity for china, india, brazil, venezuela, uae, and the saudi,'s. 1.Europe is still buying russian oil, nor will they be able to just cease buying russian oil in an abrupt manner. They wont be able to cut ties completely for years, they are not energy independant. The united states could be essentially energy dependant, but the biden administration is making that impossible.  Instead biden wants to stop importing from russia and instead import from venezuela and the saudi's, whom are essentially russian allies. You see russia has the world by the balls right now because it has aligned itself and its allies with energy. Russia's high export and control of fertilizer will also drive fertilizer prices higher and potentially ban export to western aligned countries. This creates higher govt subsidy payouts to farmers, and less crop yields, driving food prices, and creating scarcity. Russia/ ukraine provide 30% of the worlds wheat supply as well. Since russia and her allies essentially have control of gas, they can hit western countries with higher gas prices, thus adding more economic strain.

And, China, between the two nations there are only trade agreements (like almost all the agreements of this world), in the event that russia were to lose the ability to trade with most of the countries and in the negotiations only china would remain as a large country, the negotiations will be dominated by China which will completely eat Russia because it will not have the possibility to trade with others.  
 Or do you think that if China had the opportunity to make extremely advantageous deals on Russia, it would be merely doing Russia a favor?  
 In other words, do you think china will prefer russia over its own economy?

Then you take it for granted that putin and russia have prepared well for this war, instead assuming that the nato did not expect it, and you assume that russia had calculated all the sanctions. 
 Have you ever thought that maybe the Russians got their calculations wrong??
 History teaches that many countries make nonsense bullshit (the Soviet Union last century is the perfect example). Then, Russia is not the USSR of 60 years ago, it is now an economically desperate country (if compared to NATO countries or other superpowers), which has even decided to wage a war (i.e. other economic losses, lives, resources and consensus among its people) for ukraine, that is an even poorer country that has nothing to offer, in the end even in the best of cases for russia this will only be a losing war, to defend itself from ghosts, from a NATO that doesn't even want Ukraine. Without considering that until last year NATO was considered dead and useless because there were no real enemies, but today with this war Russia has made the Nato again useful, united as never before and, looking at the military investments of the member countries, NATO is even stronger than ever.

However, speculating today for the future is useless, also because the sanctions that are hitting Russia aren'y for today, but for the next few years, to ensure that Russia will never have the chance to bother again. You think that Russia has calculated everything while NATO (and the allies) have been caught off guard and don't know how to move, from my point of view it takes very little to understand that nothing is going the way Russia wanted.  I don't know if you're Russian, I don't know if you've real access to information without barriers, I don't know if you've a cultural and academic background to understand what is happening, the fact is that it seems to me that you do it really very simple for Russia, you're overestimating them a lot. However it will be seen in the next few years, I just hope that Russian civilians don't have to pay hell for the few billionaire oligarchs in government.",25f6cad314a12ad6aff17bff0a52c3af340f1311,True,False,,,,,0,1647115853,,0,{},i0eqba6,False,t3_tcawy2,False,True,t1_i0e8zv7,/r/war/comments/tcawy2/putin_wants_nato_to_join_the_war/i0eqba6/,1647115870,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647087053.0,,,,

The concern was the same as it is now, The Russian sovereignty and national security. It was a promise that was to be kept. If it was nothing, why were there literally transcripts available that said and Quoted Everything that Brady and Gorbachev said at the time? Why did nato only start expanding after the fall of the Soviet Union when Russia was at it's weakest. And why does NATO exist and keep it's membership open when the Soviet Union fell? It was all because that the US wanted to expand it's prowess to the Entire Europe. And despite your beliefs, Oral agreement or promises are enforceable if the proof is substantial and that has played out multiple times in the court of law too. You don't always need to have shit written just to have it being true. Declassified documents clearly state what Baker himself said. So you're wrong when you say there are no written documents of proof, when there are entire transcripts of conversations

Its about the good guy versus the bad guy,   it really is . Coalition intervenes because of humanitarian moralistic concerns.  Its always about morals.  World war 2 with the nazis, Iraq, Vietnam, Serbia, Afghanistan, the USA is all about morals.  So once this war rages on and methods get more brutal, and war crimes become covered,  There will be so much popular support that the democratic nation will most likely commit, whether Russia will use nukes or no not.

  Once nukes are being used they either fall back or commit further. Nukes are the logical extension of modern warfare.  Its the natural extension of invention, WE created these weapons to create massive amounts of force to destroy people. They will be used, nukes are very young still. They were only used once by the USA.  They were created less than 100 years ago. One man lives past 70.   The USA already used nukes! 

SO of course nuclear war will happen.  Its an inevitability.  We will see what happens,  of course its possible. Lots of crazy sad things are possible.

Was more than likely an F.A.E and not a nuke. If Russia uses a nuke, its proves two things.

Russia cannot fight a conventional war against an eastern European power and win.

The likelihood of nuclear war breaking out significantly increases, with Russia coming out as the clear loser. We'd still get hit hard, there's no doubt, but estimates have Russia losing up to a minimum of 50% of its population and its entire infrastructure. 

Putin knows going nuclear is suicide, he's willing to push the boundaries of what NATO thinks is acceptable, but he's not stupid enough to go over the line. 

In his mad justification of invading Ukraine, it was to prevent nuclear war. He's not going to throw all of it away now.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'd highly recommend you watch and listen to what POTUS says. They warned about the invasion, warned about the false flag attacks that Russia used to justify the war, they warned about the soldiers getting orders to fire into civilian buildings and they're now warning about a possible chemical or biological false flag attack.

So far, everything POTUS has said has happened, it's clear that they have some spies deep in the upper echelons of Putin's regime and their sources have been reliable. Putin is the only one who can order a nuclear strike so if they start warning about a possible nuclear attack, then its time to panic.",5cbe342376f951515fc98ddd8613b4f0e2e236ab,True,False,,,,,0,1647046346,,0,{},i0bailh,False,t3_tbwe9a,False,True,t1_i0a57hn,/r/war/comments/tbwe9a/this_is_the_first_pro_ukrainan_chechen_unit/i0bailh/,1647046363,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647017546.0,,,,
