by your logic erdogan version would be considered conspiracy theory as well as we cannot prove or disprove it....you should realize that if we have infromation about this mostly from erdogan the infromation lacks a lot validity, when one side spread misinformation to push their narative and we lack other sources you can take what they say for granted, for example look at what russia is doing calling ukrainians nazis and such, people in russia who lacks decent source infromation about that-and it is most of them think its true even though most of the world realise its just russian propaganda, same could be case in the coup attempt

lets be honest her, erdogans rule is quite authoritarian and the coup played perfectly into his hand, solidifying his rule and getting rid of opposition, one could understand purging army officers but journalists, teachers and such definitely not

there coud be actual coup movement and erdogan knowing about them using them to his advantage or not thing is we dont know how exactly it was and can only speculate

the fact remains that possibility that it was staged exists and because erdogan had resources,capabilities and good reason to do it, I think it is scenario with highest probability

1) I think that it is increasingly possible that Russia may not win the war in Ukraine at all, at least by the definition of conquering the entire nation and sufficiently suppressing resistance.

2) As per this having no relevance for Taiwan, this is far from clear. In particular, if nuclear gamesmanship becomes a reality, this could very much impact Taiwan. Many experts fear that the US and Taiwan have let a situation develop where China could actually succeed in a quick takeover or near takeover of Taiwan and then present it as a *fait accomplit*. The ability to try to threaten or even use tactical nuclear weapons to then lock in the victory over Taiwan and prevent the US and its allies from reversing the victory conventionally is something to be taken seriously. 

3) I think the author is looking at the geopolitical situation a bit too much in terms of classic geopolitics, and not also looking at it through the lens of the Liberal International Order (LIO), which may be being rejuvenated. The LIO project is more comprehensive than just the US balancing here and there. Singapore may be siding with the LIO and the West because it is seeing where the winds might be blowing now, and it knows it depends on the LIO for its prosperity, in addition to sharing the essential values of the LIO.

4) The author seems too sure that Cold War decoupling with China is nearly impossible. But as various players increase their supply chain robustness, you could see major powers being in a much better position in the future to isolate China economically if required. If China invades Taiwan, for example, I think you may see much more support for isolating China than many people predict.",6a2b719f3bb874064ed52a7c7142e420bde14be6,True,False,,,,,0,1647119663,,0,{},i0eys7w,False,t3_tc9p8k,False,True,t3_tc9p8k,/r/geopolitics/comments/tc9p8k/in_defending_principle_of_sovereignty_the_only/i0eys7w/,1647119677,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647090863.0

Both Ukraine and Israel have both denied it officially. This top advisor to Zelensky likewise denied it publicly, saying Israel actually pushed on *Russia* to be more realistic.

Now wonder why it is that outlets have been publishing the false story based on such loose sourcing. Normally two sources are required at minimum, and more if it’s a sensitive issue, but here just one “senior official” gave the claim anonymously.

Also wonder who was motivated to leak it. My guesses:

1) One possibility is that this was part of the larger propaganda war between Russia and Ukraine. Russia is trying to push, online at least, that Ukraine’s resistance is pointless and that it should give up. Perhaps it has a Ukrainian official on its side that wanted to say another country is pushing this narrative, ie Israel as it mediates. This seems unlikely to me, however, because the call was a private one between Bennett and Zelensky, which means someone in Zelensky’s closest circle would have to know about the call *and* support surrender and/or Russia. This seems unlikely given he’d probably be dead if he had a traitor that close. Then again, maybe that’s why Ukraine claims he’s survived a dozen assassination attempts, if someone is constantly informing on him.

2) My personal more-likely guess is that someone in Ukraine wants Israel to send weapons and support. Israel has refrained to this point, sending humanitarian aid and condemning the invasion, but keeping a measured tone because Russia controls Syria’s skies.

Too much criticism, or weapons to Ukraine, could lead Russia to close them to Israel, which would make it hard for Israel to strike the advanced weapons Hezbollah is trying to add more and more of to their arsenal. The UN is clearly useless on this front and has failed to disarm or even monitor Hezbollah buildup consistently, and no one else seems to want to get involved to prevent Iranian arms flowing to Hezbollah (or even challenge Russian dominance of the skies there, of course), so Israel is stuck between the terrorist group to its north getting even stronger more quickly as it sends weapons to Ukraine that others are already sending, or doing what it has and trying to walk the line. But Ukraine seems to want both criticism of Russia and weapons while also making Israel mediator, which indicates to me a rift either internally in Zelensky’s team, or even just confusion on their own part. Zelensky has himself called on Israel to offer more fervent support, but then praised its ability to mediate and called on negotiations to be held in Jerusalem, which is only possible if it doesn’t offer that support.

I’ll be frank, I’m not sure what the play is here. But definitely interesting to watch how far and wide this misinformation spread.

In defending this norm, the only ‘side’ Singapore is taking our own side, its own interest.

That is usually the case in every geopolitical position that countries take regarding their relations to other countries. Take Kosovo for instance: Spain doesn't recognize it and it will maintain that position because the recognition will tacitly strengthen the position of Catalonia and the Basque country to become countries of their own.

It should be an interesting exercise for anyone trying to understand what interests are at stake and the realigning forces in the world economic order to see why a certain country has assumed a certain position towards the Ukrainian conflict. South Africa is an interesting case because its a member of the G20 that didn't sanction Russia and has received great pressures from Western countries to change its stance.

Both Ukraine and Israel have both denied it officially. This top advisor to Zelensky likewise denied it publicly, saying Israel actually pushed on *Russia* to be more realistic.

Now wonder why it is that outlets have been publishing the false story based on such loose sourcing. Normally two sources are required at minimum, and more if it’s a sensitive issue, but here just one “senior official” gave the claim anonymously.

Also wonder who was motivated to leak it. My guesses:

1) One possibility is that this was part of the larger propaganda war between Russia and Ukraine. Russia is trying to push, online at least, that Ukraine’s resistance is pointless and that it should give up. Perhaps it has a Ukrainian official on its side that wanted to say another country is pushing this narrative, ie Israel as it mediates. This seems unlikely to me, however, because the call was a private one between Bennett and Zelensky, which means someone in Zelensky’s closest circle would have to know about the call *and* support surrender and/or Russia. This seems unlikely given he’d probably be dead if he had a traitor that close. Then again, maybe that’s why Ukraine claims he’s survived a dozen assassination attempts, if someone is constantly informing on him.

2) My personal more-likely guess is that someone in Ukraine wants Israel to send weapons and support. Israel has refrained to this point, sending humanitarian aid and condemning the invasion, but keeping a measured tone because Russia controls Syria’s skies.

Too much criticism, or weapons to Ukraine, could lead Russia to close them to Israel, which would make it hard for Israel to strike the advanced weapons Hezbollah is trying to add more and more of to their arsenal. The UN is clearly useless on this front and has failed to disarm or even monitor Hezbollah buildup consistently, and no one else seems to want to get involved to prevent Iranian arms flowing to Hezbollah (or even challenge Russian dominance of the skies there, of course), so Israel is stuck between the terrorist group to its north getting even stronger more quickly as it sends weapons to Ukraine that others are already sending, or doing what it has and trying to walk the line. But Ukraine seems to want both criticism of Russia and weapons while also making Israel mediator, which indicates to me a rift either internally in Zelensky’s team, or even just confusion on their own part. Zelensky has himself called on Israel to offer more fervent support, but then praised its ability to mediate and called on negotiations to be held in Jerusalem, which is only possible if it doesn’t offer that support.

I’ll be frank, I’m not sure what the play is here. But definitely interesting to watch how far and wide this misinformation spread.

You can only compare with the past, if the past is still relatively similar. New technologies can change the past so much that the older data is obsolete.

Social media I believe is one of those technologies that have changed the dynamics of the game enough to reconsider whether the civilians 'rising up' is totally off the table. The only worry is what ends up going viral, as it could either result in nationalism or desire for change.

It's too early too know right now - as it'll probably take an extended period of hardship for emotions to build up. Wasn't there a saying about how civilized people are like 3 meals away from barbarity or something?

In this case it's not war driving prices up but the effect of the western propaganda with clear hate against Russia and sanctions decided by the West.

&gt;“Britain said it will phase oil purchases from Russia _by year end_”

True, however I've heard that some operators following up from the above hate messages have already started boycotting the delivery of russian oil. Markets are already disrupted by this and by the uncertainty on our future ability to purchase enough oil.

As Russia also exports a huge amount of grains, western sanctions will also cause food shortages and famine particularly in poor countries in the middle East. The effect of sanctions there will be somehow similar to the effect of the USA engaging in wrong wars in poor countries, killing a lot of civilians.
However in general sanctions will increase inflation world wide for all. Who will pay worse consequences are the poorer people, not much Putin.

I'm not convinced that Putin will stop the war just because of sanctions, it may actually push him into a stronger alliance with China, India and Iran.

Calling Ukraine a democratic country is debatable. The main reason for the current strong involvement of the West is because the USA with Obama and Biden have invested billions in Ukraine since 2014, taking advantage of a very corrupt country to bribe/choose local politicians and do questionable deals, like the financing of labs to develop bioweapons.

I think the West should stop trying to punish Russia, take a more neutral stance, they should listen to Putin and try to negotiate a guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO and guarantee the independence of the Donbass region from Ukraine as Putin requested.

I believe a nation can integrate myth and psyche into their interests. See above, my little paragraph on Poland in the post. I think its fair to say that they are being extraordinarily careful to avoid a repeat of WW2, where they were promptly abandoned by their allies and then given up as a concession to the Soviets. What began as a feeling of betrayal has ultimately manifested itself as a policy that dictates Poland's actions today.

I'd argue a large degree of Russia's constant bemoaning of losing Eastern Europe centres around the national trauma of World War 2.

I think your analysis is correct and the quote above answers the ""red-herring"" question of ""will he retaliate with nukes"".

Putini will come to the same conclusion as NATO, which is that the donation of these (Polish) MiG-29s won't make much difference to the UAF war effort and certainly won't affect the outcome of the war, so it doesn't justify the use of nukes.

[],False,,Skeptical0ptimist,,,[],,,,text,t2_150m2g,False,False,"I’m not sure ignoring ‘feelings’ is a good idea.  While there’s no denying that national interests are the dominant force behind foreign relation dynamics, national narrative/myths are also a force which, under some circumstances, can be dominant over more ‘hard’ factors such as geography, resources, economy, strategic landscape, etc.

Here are a couple examples where national narratives/myths overrides realpolitik factors.

China’s hostility towards the US and liberal order despite enormous economic benefits and influence they afford China. Global trade enabled by US military dominance made China wealthier at a rate never seen before in history.  It also provided technology transfer from advanced economy, and enabled China to insert themselves into supply chain of all developed countries, thus giving them a huge influence in policy setting and decision making around the world.  If China were motivated by ‘interests’ alone, they would be working on inheriting the world order, and curating it, at least until they become the one enabling and maintaining it.  But their memory of ‘century of humiliation’ compels them, in stead, to abolish the order and recreate it, which is a far riskier and more difficult path.  

South Korea has strategic interests in collaborating with Japan to balance rising China.  Both countries regard China as strategic threat to their sovereignty.  S Korea has a strong army and Japan has a strong Navy: combined they would be formidable.  Both have highly developed economy and maintain bilateral military alliances with USA.  Tighter collaborations, both economical and military, would considerably strengthen both countries’s positions (in fact military planners advocate this). Yet, because of memory of Japanese colonial period (especially ‘comfort women’), frequent economic sanctions are the norm, and their militaries don’t talk to each other (joint military exercise was called off because Koreans demanded that Japanese navy not use their ‘rising sun’ flag, which goes back to their empire days).  Without separate bilateral alliances with US, it is likely these 2 countries would be at Cold War status today.

In my view, realpolitik captures certain aspects of large aggregate population dynamics, however it is not a complete picture. Humans are motivated by narratives/myths, and this certainly is a force (a small perturbation in some cases, a dominant factor in others).  So I find statements like ‘only realpolitik matters’ akin to ‘my theory is right, and reality is wrong’.  Survival of a nation requires resources, economy, strategic security, but it also requires narratives and myths.  

National narratives and myths are hard to quantify, and therefore there seems to be tendency among some scholars to dismiss it, because without it, they are able to build a more elegant model of population behavior.  

I see this tendency also among economists: ‘If only humans were rational agents who always try to optimize their utility function, then I can build an elegant analytical model!’  Then they go around and advocate people should make only economic decisions that maximize their wealth so that their model would be valid.",5bbc01069ebef99c46311920d683b2da7b20d489,True,False,,,,,0,1647089840,,0,{},i0d40nq,False,t3_tbfaph,False,True,t1_i085qyp,/r/geopolitics/comments/tbfaph/an_analysis_of_international_strategic_interests/i0d40nq/,1647089858,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647061040.0

I thought this was a good analysis from Bilahari, a retired Singapore diplomat. 

Key points: 

1. Ukraine will be defeated eventually (despite what reading Reddit may have you believe). Putin’s legitimacy to rule Russia is ultimately what is at stake for him in Ukraine. The Ukrainians are fighting heroically, but in the end the sheer mass of the Russian offensive will overwhelm them. It will not be an easy victory for Russia but a grinding and bloody war with heavy casualties on both sides.
1. Putin has united the West, and caused the Europeans to take their own defence seriously - something that all post-Cold War American presidents have failed to do. 
1. China has three mutually irreconcilable objectives which has put Beijing in a dilemna. Namely it must find a balance towards respecting sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference (due to China's own claims on Xinjiang/Tibet/Taiwan), wanting to preserve it's partnership with Russia (Russia being the only other great power which shares its suspicion of a Western-orientated global order), and wanting to stabilise its relationship with the West and avoid suffering collateral damage from sanctions directed Russia (China being much more integrated into the global order than Russia and has benefited much more than Russia from that order.)
1. Taiwan is not Ukraine, and the argument that China will take advantage of U.S. distraction over Ukraine to attack Taiwan is just silly. The U.S. is not all that distracted and there is a strong bipartisan consensus on competition with China and growing sympathy and support for Taiwan. Taiwan is a more important economy than Ukraine and a crucial node in the global supply-chain of semi-conductors.

I did not want to include them because I was eager to keep things limited to my own research and articles and talks by experts. Also, I prefer not to base my writing on the opinions of the masses, but rather that of proven strategic concerns and the actions of the leadership.  
  
That said, I'll share some opinions from the extraordinarily insignificant sample size that I have access too.  
  
Romania:  
  
The ""word on the street"" is that Romania is highly on edge about any possible spillover and the common undercurrent is that their military is in no way shape or form ready for an actual war. The Romanian people are firmly Pro-West, Pro-Europe, Pro-Nato, but that love for the west does not extend to the same willingness to challenge Russia that is seen in Poland. While they want to do everything they can to help the Ukrainian people, they don't particularly care much for the medias glorification of the Ukrainian government and demonisation of the Russian government. The term they used was ""fatigue"" from media hype (comparing the constant media attention given to Zelensky to how every headline was focused on Guaido during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis) and concern that they were attempting to whip the people into a state of willingness to support an actual intervention.  
  
Serbia and Croatia, based on semi-drunk conversations on my balcony (I actually do have a Bosnian! Gotta catch em all!, but he utterly refuses to discuss politics.)  
  
Serbia has a large degree of sympathy for the Ukrainian people, but is far more behind the Russian stance that this is a necessary action to take for a number of core strategic reasons and that NATO expansion against Russian protest is the ultimate cause for this crisis. The arguments I've heard also included a deep deep deep cynicism towards Zelensky's decision making since the start of the war. Rather than praising the decision to arm the people, free prisoners with combat experience and sign the bill allowing them to fight as combatants without repurcussions, my Serbian friend's opinion was utterly scathing and he believes that he is trying to gamble by sacrificing enough Ukrainians to force the west to intervene on the behalf of his regime.  
  
My Croatian friend (who naturally, has the most hilariously vitriolic friendship with the Serbian) disagreed on all fronts, and places 100% of the blame on Putin's decision making and the mismanagement of Russian Intelligence for determining that this was a swiftly achievable ""operation"". Except the notion that Zelensky is engineering a situation that, deliberately or not, is going to result in far more civilian casualties than any other course of action he could have taken since the war began. He also thinks the Ukrainian Military has been using civilian buildings to place AA and Artillery (thus attracting Russian return fire). Go figure, both the Balkan boys agree that the leadership's decision making is far less about saving Ukrainian's and far more about remaining in power.  
  
Please note; I do not view the opinions of friends and drinking buddies as valid geopolitical analysis. Don't take the above as fact. Its just a couple of people who are worried for their families overseas.  
  
That's before I even go into the opinions of my local ""soviet bloc"". I host a chess night on Wednesdays (we spend far more time pouring drinks and talking than making moves)...the regulars are a Russian, a Romanian, a Ukrainian, an Uzbek and a Kazakh...and a well travelled Ozzie (in addition to myself)...oh boy

You said: “I’m against sanctions, they tend to increase prices for all and punish people who have nothing to do with the original intention. I’d go as far as saying that widespread use of sanctions is symptomatic of a non-liberal regime.”

I’m also against sanctions. I am even more against war, more so nuclear war.

And then broke all of those rules anyway - AKA Libya. They would have done it in Syria too if Russia hadn't stepped in. 

As for why Russia didn't go to the UN, I'm not sure. Perhaps they simply didn't care. Some of the claims did have merit. There is plenty of evidence that Russian-speaking citizens in east Ukraine and Roma in west Ukraine have been openly targeted. That is not propaganda. The UN's own website acknowledges at least 14,000 Russian-speaking civilians in the Donbas region have been killed in the last eight years. There has been a rather unsavory right-wing resurgence in Ukraine in the last few years. Is that a reason for Russia to invade? No, but I do think we need to acknowledge the truth in this situation. It's complicated, as most post-USSR countries happen to be. Back in that time, everyone was a Soviet citizen, so these sorts of fights weren't open for discussion. Without that, these regions devolved into nationalist fault lines that are based on ethnic chauvinism. Russia is also displaying that sort of chauvinism as well.

Part of me thinks the current USSR nostalgia in Russia is more about the longing for a union of Slavic nations rather than an imperial desire, but that's a different subject.",add4f6fed192a3c43352f9fc068e7952ff81a6a6,True,False,,,,,0,1647045364,,0,{},i0b8izw,False,t3_tbren9,False,True,t1_i0amgzx,/r/geopolitics/comments/tbren9/putins_nuclear_bluff_how_the_west_can_make_sure/i0b8izw/,1647045379,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647016564.0
