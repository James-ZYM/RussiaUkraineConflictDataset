They have no Air Force anymore, their gasoline and ammunition supplies are low. I've seen their miserable supply trains; mostly wagons draw by beaten up old hoses or oxen.

Our parents believed the Cold War was the price required to bring stability between superpowers and insure the failure of communism and the Soviet Union, If only they were right.

Your argument about who Zelensky is can, is, and will continue to be debated probably far into the future - at present what matters is that he seems to be the right one for this particular job. Don't confuse your personal biases with ethical righteousness, the problem at hand is that Russia is attacking Ukraine and that's what needs to be addressed immediately. 

Let's look at what this means to understand why this is an American issue:

-[If you read nothing else, read this.](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/war-minds-mitigating-effects-ideological-subversion)

-Do some googling: ""Russian atrocities since 1900,* and ""Cold War,"" then ""Berlin Wall,"" then ""Russian American proxy wars."" Then look into ""global economic impact of the Cold War,""  There's a lot to read so take your time. You'll find that 2 countries appear often and are always on opposing sides. 


-America signed a security guarantee with Ukraine and the UK, Ukraine, and America's oldest enemy, Russia. [Russia has violated this several times.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances) Aside from the opportunity to put Russia down before it can really get strong and rise up again, consider what this means for *any* future nuclear non proliferation attempts that America, indeed the world, consider important. This is a direct threat to American security goals. What do you think the conflicts with countries like Iran and North Korea are about?

-Russia is now attacking Europe in its long campaign to rebuild the Soviet Union and [this would have many negative implications for American security.] (https://cepa.org/putin-is-determined-to-rebuild-the-russian-empire/). Allowing Putin to rebuild the Soviet Union isn't just immoral because of his methods but also will enable him to continue the goals of his predecessors, [as well as expanding upon them.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putin-wants-build-pro-russia-26646057) 

-""According to former KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin, who was head of the KGB's operations in the United States, the ""heart and soul"" of Soviet intelligence was ""not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs."" [Putin learned his place in the world as a KGB officer.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070627183623/http://www3.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/21/interviews/kalugin/) Actually, [Putin says we're already at war with him, ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-06/ex-oligarch-says-putin-sees-war-with-the-west-already-underway) and [has publicly stated so.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-western-sanctions-are-akin-declaration-war-2022-03-05/) The US has been a [long term victim already, and it will take everyone to fix.](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/war-minds-mitigating-effects-ideological-subversion)

-The US has climbed into many conlicts for lesser reasons and always justifies with moral and ethical purposes. This is a major nuclear threat and world player expanding as an enemy, looking to increase power, disrupting global stability and integrity of the rules based order, and waving nukes around like a 4 year old with a big stick. At the very least in the interest of integrity of the usual argument to enter a conflict and consistency of US policy, the US is morally obligated to step in. In its own long term security interests, from domestic to nuclear non proliferation, to the degree that they're even separable, the US is obligated to enter. Europe and the US should already be balls deep in this situation. Russia is invading Ukraine purportedly to keep the West off its borders and it, in turn, is coming up to our borders. This is with special consideration that Belarus recently legalized the local storage and launch of nukes. In the interest of a preemptive but very obviously necessary strike, the West, including the US, needs to put this mad dog that's been gnawing us slowly down before it becomes more dangerous",ccc59fba52f8b98e4e4d4a18474890cfe2e97812,True,False,,,,,0,1649515021,,0,{},i41eqsf,False,t3_tyh6ff,False,True,t1_i40oprv,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tyh6ff/the_deal_is_fair_you_give_us_weapons_we_sacrifice/i41eqsf/,1649515037,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649486221.0

This is the exact the reason russia gave to invading in the first place, you using the exact same language makes it no better. We had the nuerenberg trials just because we wanted to have a fair trial. Calling for genocide is wrong, calling for justice is something else. 

&gt;Did you see me talk anywhere about stealing/looting ?

&gt;You are just trying to muddy the waters, create excuses.


Use my wordt the way I wrote them, don't cherry pick. I have repeatedly said that they are guilty, no excuse about what they did. What I was talking about is those soldiers that are not participating in the rape, torture,... but haven't deserted yet out of fear of the things I listed. In that part of my answer I did say that sentence, nowhere else.


Please, read every answer I gave again and read only what I say in the context I said it.
- if you commit those crimes, you are guilty
- if you put 19 year old in a situation like that and discipline breaks down, things get out of hand (=observation, not excuse)
- desertion is hard, not everyone will do it, not even if the don't agree with the actions of the army
- deserters have to live of the land, which is criminal on its own right
- people who think they have justice on their side, are willing to do a lot that wouldn't be acceptable in any other situation (like being willing to drop a nuke on a country, killing innocent people in the process)
- accepting that there are nuances is not the same as muddying the water
- to be clear, I do not agree with Putin, russias invasion and even less with the war crimes
- I understand this is an emotional topic, so I do understand that emotions can get in the way of understanding the words I say, I do have a habit of looking at things a bit too dry. I apologise if that is a bit of putting, it is not intended to be, only to try and have an objective conversation about a very emotional topic",5bfb3395f088802cc7b47bb051d233a7604e6e98,True,False,,,,,0,1649483903,,0,{},i403n4r,False,t3_twwmlk,False,True,t1_i3tshe4,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/twwmlk/russian_solider_have_steal_a_phone_but_didnt/i403n4r/,1649483920,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649455103.0

Bessarrabia, the Romanian name for the region that makes up the largest portion of modern Moldova and is heavily populated by Romanians, was rewarded to Romania for being on the winning side of WW1 but Russia demanded Romania hand it over as WW2 broke out. (Sound familiar?) Romania got angry so joined the Axis so they could fight Russia and get it back. That didn't pan out, well, eh, and Russia took it back after ww2.

Stalin made it a Soviet Republic but Stalin also did not want Moldova (or any other republic) to be separatist threat so he sent hundreds of thousands of locals to Siberia, work camps, etc. where they and their progeny live out second-class existences. Meanwhile, Stalin trucked in poor Russians, minor political opponents, people who'd looked him wrong etc. into Moldova to re-populate it. But, also, he re-drew the border of Moldova east of the Dniestr River to accommodate a chunk of whatbhad been Ukraine.(Bet they loved that, eh.) This force-inergrated the future of Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian ethnic peoples and cultures. So clever, Stalin, you monster. But there is more! Stalin invested heavily in the industrialization and militarization of the tiny Ukrainian slice of the republic, which we know as Transniestria, so that is where all the power and wealth was accumulated while the more Romanian portion to the west remained more agrarian. (Seriously, if you go there now you won't be surprised to see horse-drawn carts, hand-piled haystacks, etc. as people carry own ""peasant"" traditions except they have flat screen TVs and mobile phone. It's like an alternate reality.)

So the Soviet Union falls apart but how is Moldova going to fall? The ethnic Ukrainians want it to join Ukraine, Romanians to Romania, and Russians to Russia. Romanians have the land, Ukrainians have the wealth, Russians have the military and political clout. The majority Romanians start to lean toward Romania as Romanians look toward the EU but also see a nationalist resurgence after their own release from authoritarian leadership under Nicolae Ceasescu.

Russians and Russia don't want to lose Bessarabia but their military and political power is collapsing, too. So they send in a small troop of well-armed ""peacekeepers"" which in effect create breakaway Republic within Moldova--one country with a river dividing it. This creates a wedge issue within Moldova and by wielding softpower and bribes Russia has managed to keep Moldova corrupt, impoverished, divided and politically gridlock (loke China does with North Korea, sans a despot) even as Romania has flourished as an member--or just affiliate? I don't recall it's current status--of the EU and member of NATO. Recently, transniestria has been losing population as any Russian or Ukrainian passport holder or historical native who has better options has fled. Politcal power has begun again tilting toward Romania and the EU.

What's next? Is Moldova a domino that would fall with Ukraine or might it be a fallback plan for Putin if he loses in Ukraine? Moldova and Georgia are watching all this play out with great anxiety, as their futures are tied up in Ukraine's. Interestingly, Ukraine is Moldova's big, tough neighbor just as Russia is Ukraine's. Ukraine was no friend to independent Moldova when the war there broke and if Russia hadn't intervened might have taken the transniestrian region for it's own. So while I very much appreciate what Zhelensky and Ukraine are doing to stand up for their national integrity, I do hope their nationalists do some soul searching about their own past.

If any of these countries want to join the EU and NATO, those organizations will surely want the territorial issues are worked out first. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised to Romania and Hungry go to war someday over Transylvania, especially if Orban pulls a Putin and decides an invasion mightbprovide a ratings boost. lol.

We did nothing. Russia not so quietly moved weapons, missile systems, and tanks into the Donbas, the eastern region of Ukraine. We stood back and watched; we were already caught up in ISIS and Afghanistan, but we could have helped then. But we assumed your attitude. Your callous attitude, and I am ashamed for our nation.

Now look where we are. Look where Ukraine is. If we and our allies cannot come together and support an invaded sovereign nation building a democratic society that enjoys freedom of speech, freedom of movement, all the things we enjoy, it won’t just be Ukraine and the freedom we and most of Europe enjoys.

If Ukraine falls, Russia will go after the Baltics. Look at a map. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are next. These are our allies. Then NATO and the US are in it up to our ears. Then Finland will be in Russia’s crosshairs. So will Sweden. Norway, too. These are our allies. Putin has already said that Finland and Sweden joining NATO would be tantamount to declaring war. Look at a map. Poland is also in Russia’s crosshairs. They are our allies.

Finland is in the process of filing to join NATO. They will be accepted. They are part of the EU. They have a robust military that regularly runs war games with NATO and the US. They have the necessary military hardware. What’s Putin’s move then?

You seem to forget that two World Wars and the Cold War threat to Europe has irrevocably bonded us to Europe. Japan and South Korea, too. Australia and New Zealand, too. None of these countries lives in a fish bowl, immune to what happens the next bowl over. We, the United States, are hand-in-hand with Europe. What happens in Ukraine happens to Europe. As President Zelenskyy says, again and again, “if we fall, so do you”.

FFS, where is your heart? Are you watching what’s happening, or are you just sitting back nice and comfortable in your own bubble of contentment? You, and people who think like you, need a slap of reality. If Ukraine goes down, Europe goes up in flames and we are at war. Another World War. So, now what? You think two oceans will stop intercontinental missiles? Nope. Now, what? Have you even thought that far?

I have. Though I live on a small, fixed income I have tightened up here and there so I am able to donate funds each month to charities supporting Ukrainian refugees, and the elderly, sick, and disabled who cannot get out. This month my donation goes to help Ukrainian animals necessarily left behind. It makes life a squeeze for me. That is NOTHING compared to the suffering Ukrainians. I could not live with myself if I didn’t help them in my small way. Everything helps, no matter how small. I could not live with myself if I didn’t urge my House Rep and my Senators to do everything in their power to give Ukraine what it needs to survive. NOW.
