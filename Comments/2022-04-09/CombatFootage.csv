Firstly, due to VKS's failure to perform SEAD/DEAD, they don't have air supremacy (or even superiority) in many areas, leaving their ground-attack aircraft and helos vulnerable to interception, either from what's left of Ukraine's airforce or from ground-based systems. As such, they are forced to fly low because to loiter at altitude is often to invite an attack from air defences.

Second, Russia has a very limited stockpile of precision guided munitions (PGMs), meaning that they simply don't have enough accurate weapons to conduct meaningful attacks from high altitude. This is compounded by their cutting off from GPS, which was used for the terminal guidance of their PGMs. They still have GLONASS but can only use it as far as getting in the right area, not true precision strikes as we in the West understand them.

What this all means is that the VKS is forced to fly defensively (low and fast) to avoid air defences, leaving them vulerable to MANPADS and are reliant on ""dumb"" bombs to carry out strikes.",0581e1f769e8a03ebe5270c8b7b6708db35b989b,True,False,,,,,0,1649463728,,0,{},i3z1wc2,False,t3_tzaxbc,False,True,t1_i3yzj2u,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzaxbc/ruaf_su25_over_amvrosiivka_earlier/i3z1wc2/,1649463745,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649434928.0,,,,

I don't see how a rocket is closer to a paper airplane than a paper ball. A paper airplane's mass to surface area is absurdly low, which is not the case for a rocket.

Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought lifting force was entirely thanks to the Bernoulli principle, i.e. the shape of a body must be asymmetrical in such a way as to generate lower pressure on one side than the other as the body passes through the air. There are no such features on the rocket. How can it possibly glide?

So basically a badly mauled unit coming from Kyiv/Chernihiv/Sumy won't be nearly as responsive to enemy threats or opportunities, much more likely to break and run in the face of enemy fire, and if it's particularly bad, they might even go AWOL or be the cause of a mass rout of other low morale forces.

The problem with this reasoning is that it works both ways. The units in the north were some of the most elite units that Russia has and could have been put to great use in the south or east. Remember they essentially had the element of surprise at the start.

Pulling them out now also doesn't make a lot of sense if tying up troops was the plan. Now those troops are free to be redeployed, when they would have been busy on a costly campaign to liberate the north, which they now essentially got for free. Russia paid a heavy price for what they captured in the north and then just gave it up. 

&gt; Russia is losing badly why do we need to send Ukraine arms then ?

Nobody serious is saying that Russia is losing badly in the sense the war is about to be over. Most that I follow are predicting a protracted war of attrition in which case additional supplies are essential for the Ukranians.

&gt; but it makes no sense that about 14K guys were supposed to take a city of 3 million people, especially without an air campaign or strikes by the iskander missile,

Yes, which is where the most criticism of the Russian plan is coming from. They did do missile strikes and an air assault.",f7c1ca57dd77e1a63466606e563666d86276cef2,True,False,,,,,0,1649466888,,0,{},i3z8h7n,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i3z6hgl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3z8h7n/,1649466901,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649438088.0,,,,

The stroling part might have been in eastern Ukraine tho highly doubt they thought they'll be welcomed with open arms in Kiev area 

The whole tying down thing is exactly what we did in the first gulf War with two marine divisins holding Iraqi royal guards on the coast while other units carried on, had the marines not done that I feel we would've suffered some casualties, the only difference between that and this is, mainly weapons and the Ukrainians actually confronted ( artillery mostly and ambushes) the Russians while the Iraqis well lol you know the story. But if they never tied down these guys we would've seen a huge massive offensive that would've annihilated more Russians troops if the guys from mauripool and donbass front were able to freely move and all this fight would've been over for Russia a month ago, remember they're operating with roughly 190-220k troops and not all of them are infantry or front line soliders 

For some odd reason they weren't striking weapons depots and weapons that were coming from Poland before such as the Turkish drones and javelines, but now we've seen that change I know of atleast 4 strikes on weapons depots and another strike in a railway west of Ukraine that was bringing in some ammunition and weapons, the Russians seem to have moles I'm Ukraine intelligence and military.

He's not changed in terms of mentality, he just reached that level of power and confidence (and delusion) that made him thinking that he could repeat what he did in crimea on a larger scale, so doing outrageous military and political moves without facing major consequences. This led him to commit this massive blunder as your rightly called it. 

But if you think about this blunder, if in 2014 NATO and EU reacted quickly to the crimea crisis as they did now, taking Crimea would've had been seen as a massive blunder too.

That to me is very unlikely to happen and I'll explain why: 4th Tank Division, 47th Tank Division and  3rd motorized got depleted taking Izium. They were able to push a bit further but they seem to have completely stalled. Russians are now pushing whatever they can through the northwest Izium bridge in order to keep going through two separate corridors covering both main highways. It is unclear to me how many men they are able to gather but it seems to not be enough, even if some of these reinforcements are pretty elite like the 1st guards tank army. A lot of troops are also tied up in the south to either garrison occupied territories and establish a front line there and low chance of further reinforcements coming from the Kyiv front (armies fighting in the north western front are not fit for combat anymore and on the north east it seems like low morale or refusal to fight might be happening). So with one month to go Russia will have to necessarily push with what they currently have. Is it doable? Eventually it might be, because for some reason there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency on the Ukrainian side in reinforcing these areas. 81st on the left and 95th on the right took a beating over the last month and won't be able to hold on. There seems to be reports of finally fresh Ukrainian troops and equipment arriving to Krasnopavlivka and Kharkiv but we'll have to see if it's enough. However, Russians finally seem to have realized that just pushing large convoys into a main objective (Barvinkove and Slovyansk in this case) without securing ground and villages as they go leaves them wide open for ambushes and taking every settlement one by one will be a grind. So my argument is that one month won't be nearly enough to reach these objectives, much less secure all of Donbass. And while by the 9th of May we can call this a Ukrainian victory on all fronts, it won't help the country as I feel like Putin won't stop until he accomplishes something that can be called a victory for Russia, even if it takes years to do so. Hope I'm wrong in this assessment and the Ukrainian army is able to outright defeat Russia on the eastern front by putting all the stuff they are getting from the West to good use and mounting a serious counter offensive through Kharkiv much like they did in the North.",0f9dd167973613d9f0c784f1353823b4737356e6,True,False,,,,,0,1649468783,,0,{},i3zciha,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t3_tzf5kn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3zciha/,1649468796,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649439983.0,,,,

Putin was much more calculating before and had the record to prove it. Here is how he has done in conflicts before this invasion:

Chechnya - won
Georgia - won
Crimea - won
Donbass - won
Syria- won

Also Russian economy significantly strengthened despite the corruption.

Now let’s see his calculations for this invasion:

Invade a country whose military doubles the invasion force and more than triples it after mobilization

Expect the government to fall immediately 

Expect the UA military to change sides

Expect Ukrainians to meet Russian troops with flowers as liberators

Expect sanctions to be mild

How would a person even of average intelligence really expect all this? But let’s say somehow he does. Anyone who is about to start a military campaign knows to expect not only what should happen, but also what could happen. What is his contingency plan?

I don't follow. Calling them Ukrainians gives the individuals and the side they're fighting for all the glory, without running the risk of helping propagandize a hate group.

&gt; If the ""Azov's ideology"" is so bad and should be scrutinized, wouldn't it be better to title the footage of Azov as Azov footage and not Ukrainian footage?

Precisely no. Everything about these videos portrays Azov in a positive light. These all portray them as performing courageous acts, fighting and dying bravely. Noble. Respectable. Worthy of admiration. It's 100% positive vibes ans 0% ideology, and the viewer has no reason to suspect that they're a hate group. The viewer is more likely than not to think that the organization is ""good"", and they really have no incentive to research the validity of that belief.

&gt; Wouldn't naming it as just Ukrainian make it the positive propaganda you are talking about?

It's all propaganda, but at least everyone (not in Russia or Belarus) can agree that the Ukrainians are the good guys here. Let Azov propaganda feed the greater good instead of glorifying themselves, and by proxy, their ideology.

&gt; The amount of ""brainwashing"" that goes on in is a lot less than what people claim it to be

I'm not arguing that ideological indoctrination is widespread, but this type -- the hate-group type -- doesn't need many people to fall prey to still be extremely damaging to societies.

I want to point out, too, that I'm not only talking about Azov propaganda working to promote Azov. Their propaganda can be used by any group that shares that ideology.

I think the question is whether Putin can actually afford to keep going for years.  On one the one had we have the increasing effect of economic sanctions.  On the other, we have the fact that he's sold all of this to Russia as something that shows how strong they are -- if you've seen any of the state TV broadcasts they're all talking in completely unrealistic terms about annexing Ukraine. 

The longer this drags out, the more his promise to make Russia seem strong blows up in his face.  And sanctions will make the war even more unpopular.  

What's concerning is that he's closing all of his off ramps in terms of being able to stop short of total annexation.  I don't think he can just take Donbas and stop with the expectations he's built, even assuming he's capable of taking Donbas at this point (which is very questionable).

&gt;A bred-in-the-bones skeptic, Rooney [Andy Rooney, a reporter for Stars and Stripes] ignored the fantastic claims of enemy damage and focused instead on the boys in the bombers. It was his job, he thought, to tell their story, a story “buried under the damnably cold heap of statistics the Allies are trying to pile higher than Axis statistics.”37 But there were, he conceded later, stories that were “too sad”38 to report. One in particular lived in his mind.

&gt;While Rooney and some other reporters were waiting in front of a control tower for a squadron of bombers to return, word spread that a ball turret gunner was trapped in his plastic bubble underneath the plane. “The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then return him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.” 

&gt;Just before landing, the Fortress’s hydraulic system, which was riddled with shell holes, malfunctioned, making it impossible for the pilot to put down the wheels. The emergency hand crank for operating the main landing gear has also been destroyed by enemy fire. The pilot would have to make a belly landing. “There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.”

&gt;Rooney returned to London that evening, unable to write the most dramatic and ghastly story he had ever witnessed.

TLDR; 

Germany and Austria are complaining about the economic sacrifice that that would require them having to make.  That in turn is making places like Portugal, Spain, and Greece have a big WTF moment, since Germany and Austria (and a few others) forced them to make some very crushing economic sacrifices following the 2008 financial crash.  As a consequence the duo's resistance is crumbling.

But there's one final holdout to a Russian oil ban - Hungary.  It's said it will veto any such measure, and since the vote in favour needs to be unanimous that would kill any potential ban.  But that in turn would put it in direct opposition to Poland who have long been their ally and a partner in their ""illiberal axis"".  So given the white hot burning Polish hatred of Russia going through with their veto would pretty much turn the Poland - Hungary alliance to rubble.  That in turn would allow the rest of the EU to impose all the punitive measures on Hungary that they've wanted to do due its deeply authoritarian and anti-democratic policies, but can't because they are currently being vetoed by Poland.",00508aaef19e10f4a556a82d3127957fb3cafc97,True,False,,,,,0,1649470011,,0,{},i3zf2bq,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t3_tzf5kn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3zf2bq/,1649470025,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649441211.0,,,,

&gt;The worst kind of censorship has always been the kind that newspaper people impose on themselves. I was not aware of being in any way a propagandist as a reporter for The Stars and Stripes, but there were stories I didn’t write because I didn’t like to think of the bomber crews with whom I spent so much time talking, reading them. Too sad. During the two years I covered the air war, there were half a dozen stories I couldn’t bring myself to write even though it would have been more honest if I had. I remember one in particular.

&gt;The Eighth Air Force had a disastrous day when it bombed Regensburg deep inside Germany, and I was at a base waiting to interview some of the fliers when they came back.

&gt;It was the custom for concerned ground crews and flight crews that hadn’t been assigned to go out that day to gather in front of the control tower shortly before the bombers’ ETA. (Another good time-saving acronym produced during the war: Estimated Time of Arrival. Most acronyms are used by people who think they make them sound knowledgeable when they use them, but there are some that are useful. The British were good at both acronyms and code names. They were responsible for popularizing the use of such words as “Overlord” for D-Day, “Cobra” for a strike to the south after the breakout at Saint-Lô, “Mulberry,” the name for the prefabricated docks towed across the English Channel to the beaches. I wouldn’t be surprised, in spite of their American sound, if the D-Day beaches Juno, Gold, Sword, Omaha, Utah were named by the British. Winston Churchill was referred to cryptically in top-secret memos as “Colonel Warden.”)

&gt;All of us on the ground that day were relieved as specks appeared in the sky over the Channel. As the specks grew to dots and the dots grew to spots, radio reports started coming through and it became certain the ordeal wasn’t over. There were dead and dying men on board half a dozen of the group’s bombers. There was a frantic call from one radio operator. The ball-turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble hanging beneath the B-17. The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then returned him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.

&gt;Two of the engines of the B-17 were stopped, about 3,000 pounds of dead weight hanging from the wings. The plane was losing altitude fastand flying at barely 135 miles an hour, close to stall-out speed. The pilot ordered the crew to unload everything on board.

&gt;“Everything!” he yelled in a command that reached the control tower over the radioman’s open microphone. The crew started pitching out machine guns, .50-caliber ammunition tracks, oxygen tanks, and every instrument they could tear loose in an attempt to lighten the load and keep the foundering plane in the air.

&gt;The pilot opened the petcocks on the fuel tanks to drain them down to the last few gallons. This was common practice when a plane was about to crash because it lessened the chance of fire. I think the gas evaporated before it rained to the ground because I never heard of anything catching fire on being dampened by any of it.

&gt;The hydraulic system was spewing fluid where the tubing that conveyed it was shot full of holes. The gas tanks were leaking. Nothing worked. The wheels, folded up into the bomber, could not be brought down without its hydraulic system and a belly landing was inevitable.

&gt;There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.

&gt;I returned to London that night, shaken and unable to write the most dramatic, the most gruesome, the most heart-wrenching story I had ever witnessed. Some reporter.

&gt;The incident has been fictionalized in half a dozen different ways over the years. President Reagan, in one of his speeches, told the story of a gunner trapped in the ball turret. After the rest of the crew had bailed out of the fatally damaged aircraft, the pilot was said to have left the cockpit and gone back to reach down into the ball to take the gunner’s hand in his. As the plane plummeted toward the ground, according to Reagan’s speech, the pilot said, “Don’t worry. We’ll ride this one out together.”

&gt;The story seems to have come, not from an actual incident, but from an old black-and-white movie called A Wing and a Prayer, starring Dana Andrews.

3060.0,[],False,,Ordinary-Damage2896,,,[],,,,text,t2_at4dcqyg,False,False,"Although technically correct as  you pointed out, on the western front for example, it was the Germans that were known for their lavish and very deep dugouts.  Once the order was given after the failure of the schliefen plan and order given to retreat the Germans hand picked the area's most suitable to defend ie, ridges...salients , hills.the advantage of the high ground, essentially provided much better drainage  leading  to less caveins and far more  stable ground to dig down too for entrenching . The idea was to get as comfortable as possible for the long haul ahead. Depths of 25-30ft were quite the norm ,some officers went as far as wall papering  the dug out and comandering beds from shelled out houses of the towns in that area.
  The Germans would make use of the reverse slopes on these locations which gave a large amount of protection  from the allie batteries attempts to  locate and counter battery fire at  the Germans. concealing  their batteries from  artillery observers spotters was another good  reason for the higher ground  and reverse slope entrenching. 
A big problem for the  British and French  was that they had way more qf field guns  which predominantly worked in the direct fire role and had a much shallower shell trajectory  which ment they weren't able to drop the shell's over these High ground areas and needed to be able to observe where shell's landed. However the Germans  used this to their advantage as they primarily used  a method know as  In-direct fire with Howitzers  which fired HE shell's that would fire on a much stepper trajectory up and over their positions  and into the British and French trenches . The allies theology was that they didn't plan on being there long so the were sparce in comparison, not to  mention water logged for the best part of the war",5e8a8c9eb75c36bd6a082a203f6bfe37729a1329,True,False,,,,,0,1649472437,,0,{},i3zk02c,False,t3_tz11cf,False,True,t1_i3wd8jf,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz11cf/footage_of_artillery_strikes_on_russians/i3zk02c/,1649472456,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649443637.0,,,,

[These are the lifting surfaces](https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2022_03/thumb_files/630_360_1648296023-911.jpg) on a Tochka. They are primarily for stabilization and orientation control (working in tandem with the grid fins). The lift they generate is small, but the hollow tube of steel which is a missile without fuel or payload is not a heavy object.

&gt;Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought lifting force was entirely thanks to the Bernoulli principle i.e. the shape of a body must be asymmetrical in such a way as to generate lower pressure on one side than the other as the body passes through the air.

You are not misremembering so much as misunderstanding. 

A body *does* need to generate an asymmetric pressure field to generate lift, but it does not need to be asymmetric in order to do this. Flat plates are very capable of producing lift if given an angle of attack. But wings and winglets are not the only sources of lift. For most aircraft ([exception here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body)) the vast majority of lift comes from lifting surfaces. But this is not true for rockets and missiles. Rockets gain lift both from lifting surfaces and from lift generated by aerodynamic forces working on the body itself. [Here is a simplified description of these principles](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/rocket/rktaero.html). 

There is a large caveat to all of this though. Which is the question of how stable the missile remains after releasing its sub-munitions. If you shift the center of gravity backwards -towards the center of lift- it will shorten the static margin of the body and reduce its stability. This occurs when the missile's front-sitting sub-munitions are released. If the center of gravity shifts such that it is entirely behind the center of lift, it will destabilize entirely and begin tumbling wildly. The lifting surfaces on a Tochka are far enough aft that even with a significant CG shift I do not think the missile would fully destabilize (as some people have asserted in this thread). But the reduction in stability combined with any asymmetric forces which might be incurred from releasing the sub-munitions could certainly lead to a somewhat erratic path. Other smaller cluster weapons exhibit fairly significant oscillations on release of their bombs. Whether or not Tochkas also experience this destabilization is unknown.",7ab446f115fa018ed4ff57525d6bfff2280dcb07,True,False,,,,,0,1649472455,,0,{},i3zk1dy,False,t3_tz08ny,False,True,t1_i3z22oe,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz08ny/tonkau_missiles_being_launched_from_the_donetsk/i3zk1dy/,1649472470,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649443655.0,,,,

Rummel even notes one estimate of 1million + civilian deaths but obviously extremely overexaggerated. I reference him mainly because he calculates his estimates based on sources on both sides so it's a little less biased but obviously has massive data skews on each end of the spectrum. 

[https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/walrus\_cambodiabombing\_oct06.pdf](https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/walrus_cambodiabombing_oct06.pdf) has a nice infographic on the areas bombed by the US, showing that yes bombing occurred mainly in the east of the country but that is the entire eastern side of the country, that was significantly more populated than what was presented. The capital Phnom Penh lies in the east of the country and was heavily bombed as shown in the infographic. The report also mentions Clinton's revelations on actual tonnage of ordinance dropped being significantly higher than what was previously estimated (which is important as tonnage of ordinance dropped is frequently used to estimate the death toll). The bombing also began 4 years earlier than what was previously stated, so factor that in to the civilian death toll as well. 

I think every agrees the war was a fucking waste. The only thing I wish people realize is that in 1944-1945, there really was hope for a independent Vietnam, and the US was leading that hope. Bit of a long read but this is all public information so it's not just me pulling things out of my arse.

Roosevelt made it clear on several occasions that France would not return to Vietnam and that an international trusteeship would be established to help Vietnam gain independence after the war. Roosevelt and Gen. Wedemeyer made significant efforts to counteract British and French operations in Indochina as they speculated (and with hindsight, we know they correctly speculated) that Britain was trying to put France back in power in Indochina (confirmed by Operation Masterdom). 

US operatives from OSS Deer Squad landed in Vietnam to arm and train the Viet Minh, allegedly taking part in a few combat operations together with the Viet Minh against the Japs and even marched with the Viet Minh into Hanoi (Maj. Allison Thomas can be seen in photos with the Viet Minh during the march to Hanoi). 

Lt. Col. Archimedes Patti was in Vietnam to oversea the transferring of POW's into allied hands and goes into a lot of detail about his experiences in his 1981 interview). He mentions the warm welcome he received by the Vietnamese, the terrible way the French treated the Vietnamese (and how the French were actively releasing anti-American propaganda to undermine their influence there). He spoke of how Vo Nguyen Giap (commander of Viet Minh / PAVN forces) visited him at the villa he was staying at and they had a pleasant conversation about the future of Vietnam. When the convo was over, Giap asked Patti to step outside where he was greeted by a 50piece band playing star spangled banner with the flags of the US/Viet Minh/Soviets/China (KMT)/ Britain flying overhead. A photo of Patti can be seen saluting the flag while the Viet Minh stand next to him giving their clenched fist salute (communist salute).

Patti also spoke with Ho Chi Minh several times during his stay and even spent the night at Ho Chi Minh's home going over the draft copy of Vietnam's declaration of Independence to which Patti was taken back when he first read it as it includes part of the US' declaration of Independence

***""All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""***  
***This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.""***

Patti was invited to be on stage during the declaration but he declined for political reasons. He was present in the crowd however during the declaration. This occurred on the 2nd of September. 11 days later, the British had arrived and most of the Americans were gone. The British then went to work dismantling the Viet Minh government in the South to give the French the ability to take over, which they did in a coup d'état on the 24th of September. The combined Japanese, British and French operation pushed the Viet Minh out of power in the south and allowed the French to return to Vietnam.

In January 1946, Ho Chi Minh sent a desperate letter to Truman, basically begging for the US to intervene and stop war from breaking out (https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/ho-chi-minh-truman) .

He was ignored, and unfortunately the rest is history.

The US had every opportunity to help Vietnam (going back as far as 1919 at Versailles when Ho Chi Minh originally asked Robert Lansing in letter for assistance in giving Vietnam independence).

Apply directly to the skin 2-3 inches above the bleeding site. If bleeding is not controlled with the first tourniquet, apply a second tourniquet side-by-side with the first.”

Yes. Re-read my comments and try to find me making that argument. Be my guest.

A watermark on a video is not the same type of ind=formation as a title describing Azov heroics. Hell, most users would probably just assume that Azov is a Ukrainian word they don't know rather than an organization without the help of these titles.

And yea, I've heard all the arguments about them not really being that bad. Feel free to believe that. If someone comes to you and says the KKK are the good guys now because some of their top guys are gone and most weren't that bad to begin with, I guess you'll believe that too.

When training first aid among non-medics, Combat Live Savers in the Army, the same guidance is used but in practice it was much easier to drill infantrymen to always just do high and tight, and we'll put in a more optimal location later - focus on the muscle memory to stop the bleeding and not get caught up in the intricacies of TC3.

They do not believe Russia even has the capacity to be imperialist, due to some fucked up definition that they're using. They've completely accepted Putin's justification for the invasion -- mainly NATO expansion (and a whole bunch of conspiracies). 

After arguing with many of them I've come to the conclusion that their support for Russia solely stems from their weariness, and often hatred, of NATO. Specifically, NATO's own imperialist actions in the past. They absolutely cannot see past this, to the point where they believe the Ukrainian people have no self-determination and that they fight only because NATO has manipulated them to. Basically, they've adopted a contrarian approach to all things NATO.

NATO countries have absolutely caused great harm in their own imperialist wars and meddling.

""While Rooney and some other reporters were waiting in front of a control tower for a squadron of bombers to return, word spread that a ball turret gunner was trapped in his plastic bubble underneath the plane. “The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then return him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.”
  
Just before landing, the Fortress’s hydraulic system, which was riddled with shell holes, malfunctioned, making it impossible for the pilot to put down the wheels. The emergency hand crank for operating the main landing gear has also been destroyed by enemy fire. The pilot would have to make a belly landing. “There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.”""

Because conversations I've heard, and statements by captured Russians is that many of them were lied to and  they were told they would be welcomed by the Ukrainians.

And if you want to talk about crimes in the Donbas regions since 2014, open your eyes and take a look at Russian mercenaries (paid for by Putin) have done.

Here's a few groups to look into:

* Wagner Group (Dmitry Utkin)
* Rusich (Alexey Milchakov)
* Sparta Battalion (Vladimir Zhoga)

All three are neo-Nazi mercenary groups, that have been involved in the Donbas region, lead by actual neo-Nazis.

And as an FYI, - Alexey Milchakov (leader of Rusich) graduated from torturing and decapitating puppies, to torturing and mutilating Ukrainian solders. If you look around, you can find actual photos of what they done.

So, when you make a generalised comment like ""won’t admit they don’t know shit about this conflict"", perhaps some people here know a fuck load more than you do.

During the Kosovo War in 1998 and '99 large portion of ethic Kosovo Albanians fled the region into neighboring countries, with Macedonia eventually receiving the brunt of the exodus with more then 360000 temporarily settling in the country. This was an alarmingly large number for the central government in Skopje, which predicted and was prepared to take in only about 25000 at most. What was even more concerning for the officials was the fact that in a country whose total population number more then 2 million, with a color pallet of mixed ethic and religious backgrounds, having that many Albanians in the country raised concerns the the more extremist nationalistic groups might start an armed confrontation with the goal being either autonomy or outright independence.

Indeed what the Macedonian government predicted did came in fruition in the form of some former Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army officials moving into northern Macedonia and covertly moving weapons across the border in leu to the now Albanian ethically dominated north.

The National Liberation Army (which was already formed in 1999 but had no prior conformations with neither the military nor the police) in January of 2001 began a large scale offensives and although at first the NLA managed to gain significant portion of the land, through Bulgarian and Ukrainian military support, the Macedonian Army and police forces managed to confine and later push the NLA out of major population centers and into the mountainous countryside.

The conflict would end in early November of that same year with a peaceful diplomatic solution (Ohrid Agreement) calling for the Macedonian constitution to enhance the rights of its Albanian population, and for the NLA to official to hand over all of their weapons and dissolving the movement, ensuring no recaps of the conflict could happen in the future.",e430ba7c4b079514953ee1c25ba7d6aa8fc4c3d4,True,False,,,,,0,1649491342,,0,{},i40dq7a,True,t3_tz382y,False,True,t1_i406olm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz382y/army_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_artillerymen/i40dq7a/,1649491353,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649462542.0,,,,

From the pro-Ukrainian interview with the Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot. According to him, the Russians are actively using anti-radiation missiles, knocking out a  mobile Ukrainian air defense systems. Also, the use of jamming equippment creates certain problems for Ukrainians. Unfortunately, the Russian MoD does not demonstrate the combat results of its aviation group. Also, we do not know the real scale and results of a air strikes on Ukrainian troops. Ukrainians are not interested in showing them. For example, a few days ago one target in Nikolaev was hit by the air-to-surface missile (definitely the PGM). Some photos leaked, but there was not video published. Many continue to believe that Russian aircraft (multi-role fighters jet and bombers) do not use PGM.

An important factor in assessing the effectiveness of the VSK is that  this is the first conflict in modern times where the attacked side has a relatively powerful and numerous anti-aircraft defense. BukM1 and S-300 may be in some way obsolete, but they are still formidabble, highly mobile air defense systems. I think that Ukrainian air defense has long switched to ambush tactics and time reduced sessions of combat work. With intelligence support, this tactic can bring good results. At least in creating a focal threat to aviation. Also, it's allows to keep AA-vehicles intact for a longer time.

&gt;They still have GLONASS but can only use it as far as getting in the right area, not true precision strikes as we in the West understand them.

In terms of accuracy, Glonass is no different from the GPS. At least in this region(Europe). Can you open your argument why glonass cannot be used for delivery a ""true precision strikes"".

&gt;What this all means is that the VKS is forced to fly defensively (low and fast) to avoid air defences, leaving them vulerable to MANPADS and are reliant on ""dumb"" bombs to carry out strikes, which are much harder to drop with any semblence of accuracy from higher altitudes.

New sighting systems allows to drop bombs with a high accuracy. No as good as JDAM-converted dumb bombs. But 10-15 meters of CEP is pretty achievable.Check the operation of Russian Su-24s in Syria. For the Fencer bomb raids (from the altitude 5000+ meters to avoid MANPADs) in Syria they used mostly dumbs bombs and the SVP-24 aiming system. The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane's location together with flight parameters, geoposition of target and environmental parameters (meteo data) and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided bombs.",4a3e097acc7ae35bad70e9f49950027c4418c17a,True,False,,,,,0,1649491740,,0,{},i40e8fw,False,t3_tzaxbc,False,True,t1_i3z1wc2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzaxbc/ruaf_su25_over_amvrosiivka_earlier/i40e8fw/,1649491753,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649462940.0,,,,

Without additional conscription they can really only muster the size of force we see in Ukraine which is probably 175,000 to 200,000 men at most. Even if they could take other large cities they then have to leave troops to occupy it, there are 44 million people in Ukraine and Mariupol doesn't even crack the top ten for largest cities in Ukraine. How many occupation forces would you have to leave in each city? What kind if insurrection from left over Ukrainian forces will you have to deal with? If you have to leave thousands of thousands of men behind in each city you only have even fewer men for the next attack and so on.

Plus if they group their entire army together for these attacks that let's Ukraine do the same thing. they might have more attackers but Ukraine will have more defenders as well. We've already seen how well they can defend against the Russians, they spent a month on Kyiv and Kharkiv and didn't get very far, you can't assume they would have more success the next time.

Now Russia could draft more men in Russia, rumor is they might have mobilized 60,000 reservists, but as much as many Russians might support the war the more men you conscript and the more coffins and seriously injured soldiers get sent home to Russia the more public opinion will turn against the war. That's what happened when soldiers started returning, or not returning, during the Afghan war in the 1980's and the Soviets couldn't keep a lid on the dissent, how bad could it get this time around? The true scale of how many casualties they've already suffered hasn't had a chance to sink in yet and you can't hide that people died forever, families notice when loved ones don't return or come back with crippled. You can't tell them not to talk about but after losing a son or father or grandson they don't tend care, families refused to be silenced in the 80's as well, I doubt now will be any different. And it looks like they might have had as many killed in the first month of the war as died *in the entire Russian-Afghan war.*

Sanctions have barely had time to have their effects truly felt by citizens. Unrest can only grow because of those factors, how much remains to be seen but I guarantee the risk is very concerning to Russian authorities.

Russia managed to surround Mariupol at the start of the war by catching Ukraine on the backfoot breaking out of the Crimea peninsula and the fact they already had a frontline opposing the city since 2014, now that element of surprise is gone it won't be so easy to surround the next major city. Russia could turn this into a war of attrition by drastically increasing the size of it's armed forces but whether that is something Putin wants to push forward is debatable. Sadly unless there is some highly unlikely miracle operation to relive them the forces Mariupol will eventually fall. I predict Putin will try and regroup his forces and make a push in the east to see what he can get for around a month or so. He'll have his land bridge to Crimea and most likely a source of water if they can hold some land around Kherson. He'll stamp ""job done"" on that, declare victory and stop all offensive action.

&gt; if Ukraine has the defensive capability to hold out for months, which it doesn’t

1830.0,[],False,,FilthyCatfish,,,[],,,,text,t2_125r12,False,False,"\&gt;What indicates that the Russian VKS do not perform a SEAD/DEAD operations or doing them with completely failure? 

There is nothing to suggest that the VKS are not performing SEAD/DEAD, but the fact that the Ukrainians retain aircraft and effective anti-aircraft capability is the real test. If the VKS had performed SEAD/DEAD to a good standard, there would be no further losses of Russian aircraft, for obvious reasons. Of course they are trying, but they have not had anything close to success insofar as to achieve air supremacy or superiority. Thus, they have failed in this regard.

\&gt;Unfortunately, the Russian MoD does not demonstrate the combat results of its aviation group. Also, we do not know the real scale and results of a air strikes on Ukrainian troops. Ukrainians are not interested in showing them.

There is plenty of OSINT available with which we can judge the effectiveness of VKS operations.

\&gt;Many continue to believe that Russian aircraft (multi-role fighters jet and bombers) do not use PGM.

Of course the VKS use PGMs, but they don't have enough to make consistent long-term use of them a reality. Also, as you reference Syria later, I'll add that the vast majority of VKS strike ops in Syria were conducted by dropping unguided munitions and there is plenty of evidence to support this.

\&gt;An important factor in assessing the effectiveness of the VSK is that this is the first conflict in modern times where the attacked side has a relatively powerful and numerous anti-aircraft defense. BukM1 and S-300 may be in some way obsolete, but they are still formidabble, highly mobile air defense systems. I think that Ukrainian air defense has long switched to ambush tactics and time reduced sessions of combat work. With intelligence support, this tactic can bring good results. At least in creating a focal threat to aviation. Also, it's allows to keep AA-vehicles intact for a longer time.

Indeed, this is the first time a relatively modern air force has faced a comparable opponent. That the Ukrainian air defences even retail functioning levels of equipment is testament to the VKS's failure to suppress or destroy them. They made an attempt during the first days of the war, and we saw (and continue to see) losses, not just of the flashy new equipment like KA-52s and SU-35s, but across the range of the VKS inventory. Of course there is value to claiming the kills of the latest and greatest, but the evidence suggests kills are being achieved on older kit too.

\&gt;In terms of accuracy, Glonass is no different from the GPS. At least in this region(Europe). Can you open your argument why glonass cannot be used for delivery a ""true precision strikes"".

In terms of navigation, Glonass is comparable to GPS. In terms of PGM strikes, many Russian PGMs relied on GPS in the terminal guidance phase of the attack. These weapons are not able to use Glonass in this phase, resulting in lower accuracy. 

\&gt;New sighting systems allows to drop bombs with a high accuracy. No as good as JDAM-converted dumb bombs. But 10-15 meters of CEP is pretty achievable.

I think we have different definitions of ""high accuracy"". A CEP of 10-15 meters is not enough when dropping relatively small (up to 500kg) munitions on hard targets, or in urban areas. This results in significant over-claiming (a problem all air forces face), poor effect on target and high levels of collateral damage. All of these have been seen from the VKS in Ukraine and in Syria. The collateral damage, it seems, may even be deliberate.

\&gt;The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane's location together with flight parameters, geoposition of target and environmental parameters (meteo data) and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided bombs.

Yes, it's a bomb sight.

**Translation by google, I fixed a couple of errors:**

  
Summary of the LDNR (I don't have any current data on the rest of the front):

  
~~Raisins~~ Izium *(note by me: Izium is Russian for raisins)*: fighting in the area south of the city. No significant changes. Mutual artillery strikes.

  
The Ukies are intensively preparing Slavyansk and Kramatorsk for defense, turning them (together with the long-fortified Karachun) into one big ""fortress"". The Russian military will be asked to once again break its forehead and bleed here.

  
Rubezhnoe. Contrary to earlier statements, the city is not completely under the control of the Armed Forces of the LPR and the Russian Federation. Heavy fighting continues in the city and the surrounding area without much success.

  
Popasnaya is exactly the same picture as in Rubezhnoye.

  
Near Avdiivka - there is no progress. This point has been turned into a fortress, it is useless to storm it with the forces of only ""second-rate"" mobilized battalions of the DPR, as they are trying to do now. Moreover, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to actively strengthen and continuously throw manpower to replace losses.

  
Marinka - most of the village - is still under the ~~shelters~~ UKRs *(note by me: he says под украми, which google mistakes for под укрытиями - under shelters)*. Otherwise, everything is the same as with Avdiivka.

  
On the Kurakhovsky direction - without significant changes. Kurakhovo itself has been turned into a powerful fortified area and continues to strengthen. Another ""fortress"".

  
In Mariupol - I do not have reliable confirmation of the full control of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the DPR Armed Forces over the Mariupol port. We can only say that the port village has been completely taken and cleared and that our troops have entered the port itself.

  
Fierce fighting continues in the vicinity of Azovstal, and the storming of the plant itself is still a long way off.""Kadyrovtsy"" - strictly in the second line.In the first , almost exclusively the DPR Armed Forces. With appropriate victims. (Every day I get messages: ""so-and-so is killed, so-and-so is wounded."")

  
In general, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces has finally stalled in the Donbas. The continuation of attacks by the Donetsk infantry sometimes brings minor local successes.  
With the regrouping of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, much is not clear. In a week and a half to two weeks, everything will turn green, it will be even more difficult to advance.

You can see that the EU countries don’t have the military power as they haven’t been building it for a while now. On the other hand, Russia has allies that don’t like the US and in the event of a US invasion would gladly take Russia’s side.

They didnt fought much according to their doctrine in first few weeks. The fact that they retreated from north to strengthen the south means they are building up for offensive according to their doctrine.

&gt;It wasn't a matter of interest, it was a matter of taking lopsided losses, facing sustainment and logistical failings, as well as finding their positions increasingly untenable. They had no choice but to retreat.

Definitely.  Inflation there is up around 10%, GDP is projected to fall so far it will wipe out the last 10-15 years of growth, and people are resorting to a ""gray-market"" for buying goods.   


But the sanctions aren't meant to work quickly, they're not just supposed to make life hard for Russian people, they will be damaging the more technical portions of their economy for years, or even decades, even if they are lifted soon.

697.0,[],False,,DJC71AU,,,[],,,,text,t2_522u04kv,False,False,"There are certain users who are deliberately spreading a whole lot of misinformation, particularly in regards to Ukraine and the Donbas region.  
  
In the interest of clarity, there are three main Russian-backed neo-Nazi mercenary units that have been fighting in Donbas on and off since 2014.  
  
They are:  
  
\- The Wagner Group  
\- Rusich  
\- The Sparta Battalion  
  
These three groups are known to be led by neo-Nazis and far-right ultra-nationalists.  
  
  
**The Wagner Group**  
  
The Wagner Group was formed by Dmitry Utkin, a Russsian who was previously a lieutenant colonel in the GRU special forces.  
  
Utkin's call sign was ""Wagner"", which is a reference to Richard Wagner, Adolf Hitler's favourite composer.  
  
Utkin also has nazi related tattoos - specifically, Waffen SS collar tattoos as well as a Reichsadler tattoo on his chest.  
  
Dmitry Utkin is on the payroll of Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka ""Putin's chef"". Prigozhin is a close associate of Putin, and also funds the St Petersburg troll factory.  
  
Wagner Group initially fought in the Donbas region of Ukraine in support of separatists, however, they have also worked in Syria, Libya and other countries.  
  
They are currently actively involved in the war on Ukraine.  
  
  
  
**Rusich**  
  
Rusich was formed by Alexey Milchakov and Yan Petrovsky, two Russian neo-Nazis.  
  
As a teenager, Milchakov had quite the reputation in St Petersburg. Not only was he a neo-Nazi, but he also achieved some infamy by cutting the head off a puppy, and posting the photos online. These photos can still be found online.  
  
He also wanted other neo-Nazis in St Petersburg to kill stray dogs and the homeless.  
  
Milchakov served time in the Russian military as a paratrooper.  
  
After meeting Yan Petrovsky through The Russian Imperial Movement, they formed Rusich with Milchakov serving as the leader, and Petrovsky as his deputy.  
  
Rusich fought in the Donbas region alongside Russian-backed separatists, where they gained notoriety for mutilating the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. Again, there are photos online.  
  
Petrovsky lived in Norway for quite some time, however, because he had never taken out permanent residency, the Norwegin Government sent him back to Russia.  
  
Ukraine wanted Petrovsky extradited to Ukraine, where they wanted to put him on trial for his crimes in Donbas.  
  
Norway sent him back to Russia.  
  
At times, members of Rusich have worked with the Wagner Group in places like Syria.  
  
They have also continued their involvement in the Rusian Imperial Movement, specifically, the armed wing who are known as The Imperial Legion.  
  
Milchakov and Petrovsky have been involved in training neo-Nazis and far right groups in a training camp located near St Petersburg.  
  
They are currently actively involved in the war on Ukraine.  
  
It was recently reported that Milchakov had been wounded.  
  
  
  
**The Sparta Battalion**  
  
The Sparta Battalion is another neo-Nazi, far-right ultra-nationalist group active in the Donbas region.  
  
They have been involved in fighting since 2014.  
  
Their original leader was Russian born Arsen Pavlov, whose callname was ""Motorola"".  
  
Motorola was killed in 2016 when a bomb exploded in his elevator. There are conspiracies about who killed him.  
  
Vladimir Zhoga (also a Russian neo-Nazi) took control until he was killed in early March 2022.  
  
After Zhoga's death, Russia announced that he would be given the award of ""Hero of Russia"".  
  
Not bad for a neo-Nazi who was killed fighting a war...sorry, ""special operation"" to de-nazify Ukraine.

I hope this helps people.

690.0,[],False,,SexualToothpicks,,,[],,,,text,t2_f5gyc,False,False,"So I was pretty surprised that Russia is still engaged in Kharkiv, as I figured when they pulled out of Chernihiv and Sumy, Kharkiv would be next, as it's a similar situation where they're taking significant losses fighting in a suburban area where the defenders have a huge advantage with practically no chance of actually taking the cities.  However, I think I'm seeing the reason why Ukraine hasn't just snowballed down south and pushed the Russians out in Kharkiv after clearing the north.

1 - Russia cannot give up the siege of Kharkiv without exposing the northern flank of their Luhansk offensive, which would be deep in open Ukrainian territory and extremely vulnerable to being cut off and destroyed.  If that happens, Ukraine might even be able to roll up the entire Donetsk front starting from the north. 

2 - Much of Ukraine's forces in the north that liberated Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy are territorial defense units that cannot be easily relocated south, both in terms of political will and their need to stay in the north to ensure Belarus doesn't get testy or Russia doesn't push again, not to mention logistical problems.

3 - Russia could more easily pull troops out of Sumy and send them to Kharkiv or Izyum due to their own internal rail network around Belogorod.  Ukraine's transportation infrastructure in the east of the country has likely taken a beating from artillery and airstrikes, whereas the Russian transport infrastructure has been largely untouched. 

I'll be the first to admit I'm an armchair strategist at best, but does anyone else have any input on the Kharkiv situation?  I'm very interested in discussing it and hearing any input you guys have.

For a HE 120mm mortar shell it's 30m defined as 2 shrapnel with enough energy/mass to kill per square meter. 

In reality its a bit more complex and there are actually a number of fancier models proposed how to calculate or define the lethal radius of fragmentation shells. For example: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914720303834](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914720303834) where they stretch the lethal radius for a mortar shell out to 38m. But all the math in the world cant change the fact that its propability based thing. You might be standing up, get a mortar shell to land 15m away from you and walk the concussion off or you might have one landing 150m from you and that one bastard shrapnel piece finds your jugular artery and that's the end for you. 

Anyway, as a rough rule of thumb, as far as I understand.

* 120mm is approx 30m radius
* 155mm is approx 50m radius

For soft targets. If it lands within 1/4 of that distance, roughly, it can even fuck up armored targets without landing a direct hit.",50c55787b19fea02926fa9286136b5f6cbae9a7d,True,False,,,,,0,1649513510,,0,{},i41b97n,False,t3_tz11cf,False,True,t1_i415lcg,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz11cf/footage_of_artillery_strikes_on_russians/i41b97n/,1649513525,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649484710.0,,,,

The thing is with Russia is that wealth distribution by region is way way more fked up than in any other European country.

Our richest region is greater london, which has a per capita income 3 times greater than the poorest (Northumbria) in Russia the gap between the richest and poorest regions is over 50 times.

The first is that if this is a ground attack sorty, which would be the only reason to put a vulnerable ground attack jet in the air, then the closer you are to the target, the more successful and accurate you will be.

In regards to what Zelensky said, it's one thing to say that and the other to act on it. Plus, what does it mean to support occupiers. There's a big difference between simply obeying Russian soldiers because your life is at stake or actively supporting the in reaching their objective. At the end of the day, these are civilians, it's a wild assumption that the soldiers who are going in to liberate them from Russian invaders are just going in head first and shoot anyone on site for potentially ""supporting Russian soldiers"". It may happen, but there's a low chance of it.

There's a lot of potential scenarios what has happened there, and as you mentioned we may never know the real truth. Maybe they did a massacre, maybe they did shit but not to the extent the media is painting it, maybe some people died from Ukrainian shelling, maybe some rogue soldiers killed their own people. There's a lot of maybes here, but if we take the duck argument, what probably is a duck here is that the Russian side did some bad shit to civilians. Until there's a solid good argument against it, we can take it as the most likely scenario (you're free to think otherwise, of course)

I like to look at the way both sides act to it as well. The Ukrainian side is acting in a way that suits both arguments (either it was a massacre or they'd like to paint it's a massacre), so a bit hard to discern from theirs only. The Russian side either has an issue with their PR (too deep in their propaganda) and is making bad decisions or they actually did it.",68f27da66527d4a6941e43f20f9dd9a6693440d0,True,False,,,,,0,1649518156,,0,{},i41mbzh,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i40zrya,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i41mbzh/,1649518171,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649489356.0,,,,

The angle is based on the way the rocket was found. It's very likely that that rocket was ""bouncing around"" when it exploded, due to the sheer force of the explosion, therefore it could be the whole grey circle.

*I know that this story was originally written by Andy Rooney who was a correspondent for ""Stars and Stripes"". He was at the airfield when the incident occurred.  Rooney recalled, “I was there when they came back from a raid deep in Germany, and one of the pilots radioed in that he was going to have to make an emergency landing. He had only two engines left and his hydraulic system was gone. He couldn’t lower the wheels and there was something even worse. The ball turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble beneath the belly of the bomber.  Later I talked with the crewmen who survived that landing. Their friend in the ball turret had been calm, they said. They had talked to him. He knew what they had to do. He understood. The B-17 slammed down on its belly and onto the ball turret with their comrade trapped inside.”*",27e0a45f6c51ae367d1795d5272447bb481c8c86,True,False,,,,,0,1649518646,,0,{},i41njqp,False,t3_tzcr9y,False,True,t3_tzcr9y,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzcr9y/the_story_of_the_wwii_ballturret_gunner_who_was/i41njqp/,1649518664,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649489846.0,,,,

He has actually been very open and revealing about a lot of details.

He claimed moral responsibility for MH17 being shot down while oddly denying actual guilt that would hold up in a court basically.

He admitted that most of the ammunition they seized in the beginning of the war was defective ( corrupt and decrepit 2014 Ukrainian army) that’s why they were so reliant on “humanitarian convoys”.

Most revealingly he says that without the Russian hybrid war the whole separatist armed conflict would have “fizzled out like Odessa and Kharkiv”.

He spoke about how even in donbass it was just minor skirmishes between his guys ( agents, assets, Russian ‘holiday soldiers’  and security services personnel) vs. right sector guys and the like.

It’s absolutely insane because I remember you specifically can go back and watch the vice news Russian roulette episodes.

There’s one where some right sector guys were ambushed and killed and thrown in some wooded area. You had pro-Russian people acting like they don’t know what happened but looking back it’s funny how all the people calling shots were basically in synch with russian security forces and military officer directives the whole time.

We didn’t know that.

Even now before the war started, a CIA journalist guy on the team house (navy seal) podcast mentioned how penetrated the SBU is. They had tonnes of pro-Russian cells and anything that Americans told the SBU they expected the Russians to know.

This also lines up with what we know about Putins spymasters being in charge of readying assets and preparing people for the invasion.

I think it was explained that’s why Kharkiv fell? That there were pro-Russian traitors that basically sabotaged the defense.

And the whole operation ranged from bribing officials to setting up alternate politicians, western declassified intel said that after eliminating Zelensky they had a shadow government freshly baked and ready to install.

It’s really good to look at Strelkovs revelations as they do provide insight on past actions and mostly are confirmed with what we know. It also tells us how they likely hoped to see things go with this invasion.

It seemed the “Kharkiv” people’s republic didn’t quite work out though, I’m mixed up but I can’t tell if it was Ukrainian officials pointing out how Kherson or Kharkiv people’s republic operation failed this time.

Either way after the war started CIA journalist spoke about how the Ukrainian intelligence services were finally rolling up all the pro Russian cells and assets they had on “watch and wait” for months. That’s why we saw so many arrests of higher ranked people for treason and some mayors etc. They’d long been fingered.",835695ff0be5655cbb75ca47aa40c6777b5993c7,True,False,,,,,0,1649519289,,0,{},i41p59m,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i40yw68,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i41p59m/,1649519301,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649490489.0,,,,

I know its hard to believe if you have been following the conflict through the Russian narrative but some of us have been following the conflict since 2014 in military forums etc. 

The Russian deniable assets used in 2014 and 2015 were pretty much tied off as loose ends by the Russians during the 2015 Debaltseve operation and during the 2016-2017 reorganization. 

Russian special forces command failed to achieve the promised results in Deblatseve and Russian regular army command was given lead to clear out the situation. 

During this these deniable assets were pretty much used as cannon fodder ahead of regular Russian armed forces units partly to minimize regular losses but also because of inner power within Russian armed forces where special forces command had gained a lot of political influence after the Crimean operation. When they failed in Deblatseve and Russian regulars had to be brought in the regular army command wanted these old assets gone so they pretty much ordered them to advance against dug in Ukrainian positions. 

Mass casualty events among the ""separatist"" forces followed which leaked. During 2016-2017 the Russians spent time killing of the old separatist figureheads and removing loose ends from old operations. 

From 2017-2018 onward they spent time building the 35k mostly recruiting from Russia which also leaked online as the recruitment advertisements for security work ""in Crimea"" werent exactly hidden. 

They also extended this offer for people needing to escape legal issues in Russia. 

It has also leaked that those who went to serve are now not allowed back in to Russia which i am sure you have heard of?

Most local young people able to work have moved either to Ukraine or Russia for employment and the so called ""novorussia"" project was ideologically bankrupt quite early because as you recall Putin was clear early on that he did not want to annex Donetsk, Luhansk in those days. 

So no one wanted to ""join"" these deniable asset separatist forces other than old men needing the money.",9f3a643603013c2ba7b86eefe664708f25177439,True,False,,,,,0,1649521196,,0,{},i41twoy,False,t3_tzr251,False,True,t1_i41s0ld,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzr251/latest_defence_intelligence_uk_update_on_the/i41twoy/,1649521212,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649492396.0,,,,

When Australian SF was accused of killing civilians people found the bodies, they found plenty of civilians with matching stories that was supported by physical evidence found at the scene.

Note that it's the standard lighting bolt design of the SS, but with some modifications.

The colour of the patch is also important. Note the black, yellow and white miniature flag.

The colouring is important - it's the Imperial flag of russia, which is used by many neo-Nazi groups and ultra-nationalists, and the Russian Imperial Movement.

You can search for the ""Russian Imperial Movement"" group. You'll note that when I wrote about Rusich, I also mentioned that they were running training camps outside of St Petersburg with the armed wing of RIM - the Imperial Legion.

And then there is this, which I think it pretty self explanatory:

That is Vladimir Zhoga when he was younger.

NOTE: I can guarantee that someone will say ""That's not him"".

As I said, it was taken when he was younger.

5193.0,[],False,,TheMalcore,,,[],,,,text,t2_7ikct,False,False,"&gt; Inertial guidance is a system that can improve accuracy. But it is not what people today consider under ""guided"" or ""precision"".

[Yes it is.](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45996.pdf) 

&gt; Common conception of a guided weapon is target selection and tracking, camera or laser involved...

So you are implying that guided weapons don't include INS/GPS guided weapons like JDAM? A weapon that I'll remind you carries the GBU (**Guided** Bomb Unit) designation. 

&gt; ...but it should be defined with CEP. With a CEP of 150m Tochka-U is an area weapon.

*How* accurate the weapon is doesn't change the fact that is has a guidance system that is guiding the weapon. Just because a car has a weak motor doesn't mean it isn't a *motored* vehicle.

&gt; Amunition with other augmented delivery system, like for example iron bombs droped from bomber equiped with GPS/GLONASS assisted drop system that can reach CEP of under 15m can be considered precision hit weapons.

No, that just not how this works. Dropping an **unguided** weapon from a guided aircraft doesn't magically make the weapon guided just because it is more accurate. Again, I have to reemphasize, **how accurate a weapon is doesn't change the fact that it does or doesn't have a physical guidance system onboard.** Furthermore, you are applying a completely arbitrary accuracy test to your argument. 150m isn't accurate enough, but 15m is. Well, what is that based off of? Just how you're feeling? What's the magic number? is 45m too big? is 21.687m accurate enough?

A weapon being guided or not isn't dependent on how *effective* the guidance is, it's dependent on whether there is an actual guidance system being used on it.",a5957a92472818c110b3d040c4ae4f7386845ee2,True,False,,,,,0,1649522661,,0,{},i41xj91,False,t3_tz6lcd,False,True,t1_i40oasq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i41xj91/,1649522674,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649493861.0,,,,

Ok, maybe. The US, which is the big player in this conversation, has been at war for 20+ years though.

There are a lot of countries in NATO who would not be able to offer much against someone attacking the US - but because they're in NATO, it's much less likely that a smaller aggressor will attack them. That helps keep the peace, which means less dead people, which is good. So in a purely military sense, the US doesn't get a lot out of it, but the other NATO leader states - France, the UK, Germany - have a huge interest in preventing wars in Europe and ensuring they have mutual security if someone (cough Russia cough) gets aggressive. That interest is not only military, but also economic and humanitarian. And by being involved in the formation of NATO, the US clearly showed that it's also interested in securing peace in Europe, even if that was based on grr commies and not pure altruism.

In return, smaller countries do make financial contributions, as well as hosting NATO bases on their territory and cooperating in various ways.

There is actually some debate in various NATO members about whether they actually would respond to a Russian attack on another NATO member. The idea, of course, is that the deterrent threat is strong enough that no one tests that in reality.

Also, like...what other great powers are you worried about? Russia...well, Ukraine _without_ NATO is hammering Russia. So yes, a smaller country absolutely can make a big difference, although if Russia were to go east instead that would make it difficult geographically. But if Russia goes east, the US goes nuclear. China? China doesn't want to attack the US. They're interested in local land grabs; their competition with the US is mostly economic.

It was just a hypothetical. *If* a country's military was strong enough to really make it a fair fight with the US, Ukraine's involvement, I don't think would make-or-break that war. That was my point. 

You make a good point. I guess from that perspective it makes more sense. However, if the goal is to deter war then adding Ukraine to NATO, I don't think accomplishes it. Those in power in Russia cannot stand the fact that Ukraine isn't willing to be in their sphere of influence. At this point in history I don't think it's a wise move to force that issue by signing up NATO to get involved. They got away with it when it came to the Baltics, perhaps they weren't as important, perhaps Russia was still too weak. They got away with it when it came to Poland and the others but they weren't ever a part of the USSR either, they were always at least a tiny bit independent. But then the rumblings about Ukraine and Georgia started and we see how that ended up. To analogize, I think there is a difference between erecting a barricade on a road to stop a car from driving past when the car is hundreds of meters away and has time to stop, and places to turn off. It's another thing entirely to yeet that barricade in there when the car is a second away from passing that point. Maybe it's slams on its brakes, maybe it just says fuck it and runs it hoping for the best.

Ukraine has a track record of firing those missiles. Including the one that hit the apartment building in Donesk (likely not the target). One that hit one of the their bases and one that hit the port where the ships were stationed.   
The accuracy is within 150m. So not pinpoint accurate. It could have easily been a missed or faulty intelligence on the target. 

Or maybe it is a Russian missile out of storage. Who knows.   
It's easy to verify via serial number and erase all doubt. If Ukraine checks the serial number database and it's not on there, then by default it leaves Russia responsible.

The USSR did not break up units by republic. There were plenty of large-scale units based in multiple republics at once and multiple districts within several republics. Ukraine included at least four, two of which were split between Ukraine and Moldova when the Union broke up.

No, missiles were accepted by higher commands and disbursed to operational units as required.

I googled the query ""Sparta battalion nazi"", the most relevant link that came up was a dailymail article (known to be one of the shittiest ""media sources"" on the planet) with only a title saying one of the leaders was killed, referring to them as a ""neo nazi mob"". The body text for the article however does not elaborate any further on what them being neonazis entails - in fact it doesn't mention nazism or fascism again aside from the title.

There are literally hundreds of articles titled something along the lines of ""Russian warlord who led Neo-Nazi 'Sparta Battalion'"".

They literally appear in almost every search (which I find frustrating).

I don't live in the UK so I don't know the quality of newspapers over there, except Rupert Murdoch sucks (that's also an Australian thing).

What I do know - and I have mentioned this in another response to someone else - is that the Sparta Battalion patch has the lightning bolts associated with the SS, as well as the black, yellow and white miniature flag.

The colours of that flag are important, as it's a flag associated with the Imperial flag of Russia, which is used by many neo-Nazi, white supremacists and ultra-nationalist groups, including the Russian Imperial Movement.

You will note that I have mentioned the Russian Imperial Movement, and their armed wing, The Imperial Legion in the section about training camps for neo-Nazis.

Getting back to the Sparta Battalion, the group was formed by neo-Nazis back in 2014.

They weren't getting a lot of media attention back then, as the west wasn't really interested until Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down, and then then the media focused on MAH17.

[Tag24.de](https://Tag24.de) have an article that touches on the formation of the Sparta Battalion.

[https://www.tag24.de/thema/ukraine-konflikt/er-wird-als-russischer-held-gefeiert-neonazi-warlord-stirbt-offenbar-in-der-ukraine-2359945](https://www.tag24.de/thema/ukraine-konflikt/er-wird-als-russischer-held-gefeiert-neonazi-warlord-stirbt-offenbar-in-der-ukraine-2359945)

The below is the translated version (from German):

\---

Zhoga had been the leader of the so-called ""Sparta Battalion"" since 2016. This is a military unit that is active in the People's Republic of Donetsk - an area that actually belongs to Ukraine but which was recently granted independence from Russia.  
  
The pro-Russian military group has existed since 2014 and mainly consists of neo-Nazis who want to volunteer to fight the Ukrainian troops. Even before the current war broke out, they were repeatedly involved in battles in the crisis region.  
  
In addition, the ""Batallion Sparta"" is accused of various war crimes, some of which are said to have been documented in videos - Vladimir Zhoga himself is said to have murdered Ukrainian prisoners of war, for example. This is how he earned the title of ""Warlord"".

\---

So, whether you choose to accept it or not, the Sparta Battalion grew from neo-Nazis who wanted to fight Ukrainians.

They also adopted the colours of the Imperial Russian flag, which is synonymous with neo-Nazis in Russia, white supremacists in Russia, and ultra-nationalists in Russia.

And on that patch, they use the SS runes, which is very common amongst neo-Nazis (including Azov).

All of this could be found easily with a search.

In my original post, I stated:

""I implore you to do your own research, and correct others regardless of whether they are deliberately trying to spread misinformation, or inadvertently spreading it.""

And yet, people ignored that and started demanding I help them and were pretty freaking rude.

It's now 5:19 AM in Australia.

Instead of demanding that I prove it to them, they could have fucking looked it up themselves instead of being entitled brats.

I don't get paid for this. And I certainly don't get paid to help entitled brats who should be capable of finding it out themselves.

Fuck them.

So do good while you can, with the You you have.

Aircrafts used to have very complex bombsigths since WWII, they had analog ""computers"" to increase precision, but it would still be way of and required a very steady fligth path. Modern Israeli and Russian system use GPS/GLONASS data, to calculate drop point and with these CEP is 5-15m even when release is from 5000+m. JDAM has GPS on the bomb, so it does mid course corrections, but is much more expensive. There is also the difference of Iskander to Tochka. Iskander recives updates on target coordinates during fligth, there is even the optical head. So Iskander is more like JDAM. Nobody decides arbitrary witch CEP is precisions hit and which is not. If a Tochka lands 150m of target, target does not get destroyed. If Iskander or Tochka lands 15m of target , target is destroyed. Iskander has a CEP of 30m, down to under 10m, with guidance. If an iron bomb of 200-500kg lands within 5m of target, the target is destroyed. More or less, depends on target type, soft, hard.

[No, we were talking about **guidance**.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i3xadat/) Don't try to shift the conversation onto a different word. 

&gt; Aircrafts used to have very complex bombsigths since WWII, they had analog ""computers"" to increase precision, but it would still be way of and required a very steady fligth path. Modern Israeli and Russian system use GPS/GLONASS data, to calculate drop point and with these CEP is 5-15m even when release is from 5000+m.

*Completely* unrelated to the conversation of if INS is considered 'guided'.

&gt; JDAM has GPS on the bomb, so it does mid course corrections, but is much more expensive.

INS provides mid course correction too. The only difference between GPS and INS is GPS uses measurements of signals from satellites to keep track of it's own position, and INS uses inertial measurements. 

&gt; There is also the difference of Iskander to Tochka. Iskander recives updates on target coordinates during fligth, there is even the optical head. So Iskander is more like JDAM. Nobody decides arbitrary witch CEP is precisions hit and which is not. If a Tochka lands 150m of target, target does not get destroyed. If Iskander or Tochka lands 15m of target , target is destroyed. Iskander has a CEP of 30m, down to under 10m, with guidance. If an iron bomb of 200-500kg lands within 5m of target, the target is destroyed. More or less, depends on target type, soft, hard.

Again, **none** of this is relevant to whether the INS in Tochka is a guidance system. 

&gt;  I say the hell with nomeclature, all that is important is how accurate a weapon is.

No. It's. Not. 

How *good* the INS is inside Tochka does not change the fact that it **does** have it.",7c0c6adc455d069b8262591fb888a6938a4f3490,True,False,,,,,0,1649533546,,0,{},i42nzq3,False,t3_tz6lcd,False,True,t1_i42mbg0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i42nzq3/,1649533558,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649504746.0,,,,

But if the reason to invade a country is because there are 1000-2000 nazis (azov battalion size was estimated between 900 and 2500 members), then you could use this excuse to invade a large amount of countries in the world. And you know it. 

If you are able to take the bait that Russia is invading a country with 44 million people because of that amount of nazis you're either dumb or just in bad faith.

 I am Russian, I have Ukrainian mother, and have quite a lot of relatives in Ukraine (2 of my mother's sisters and their kids and kids of kids)
 For one 2 Of my Aunts lost their livelihood in 2014-2015 due to shelling from Ukrainian side. (they lived in Donbas region, some of them moved to Kiev to be supported by other relatives, some stayed behind). Over years we have seen a lot of atrocities committed by UA in Donbass. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Horlivka
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_of_Angels
to just name a couple of things
No one in the world basically cared about that. and Victims accumulated over years.  another things  that you would want to know is that a lot of Protests in 2014 were going with chance like ""moskalyaku na gilyaku"" - which means ""Hang the Russians"".  
one of the bludier episode of initial protest is Trade Union House Fire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Odessa_clashes perptrators were never caught or brought to justice. 
make not this is even b4 donbass war, there is no actual enmity with Ukraine and that what was going on. Basically Ukraine was being turned into Anti-Russia. Top of that was so called Language Law that forbids usage of Russian Language in anything but casual conversation (Press, education, TV, Services - all should be in Ukrainian now, despite huge percent of population speaking Russian as native) They even Split the church. well those are internal problems but from Russian side it seems as attempt at forceful assimilation. 

To be fair, answer to this question is quite complex. Without Elaboration since it's already takes to long
NATO - Problem
Nazi - They do exist and need to be destroyed
 Opinion on war ""Proxy war with USA that used ultra right paramilitary groups to install puppet regime to use it as expendable pawn against Russia. Unless threat is removed - it will blow up sooner or later since it is Not the Will of Ukraine but the will of the puppeteer""

Is it in line with propaganda? Maybe. Did i see the evidence to support this line of thinking - yes. 

&gt;Do you think Ukraine or nato was really going to attack Russia?

In case Ukraine was somehow admitted into nato - it would instantly make the block enter conflict with Russia Due Donbass and Crimea. Thats is why Russia specifically asked for years for guarantee of  Ukrainian neutrality. Also while i cant confirm it and it might be propaganda - in some conscription offices were found medals ""For retake of Crimea"" according to Russian sources (with pictures of those attached) while it is not really believable - that still exist.

Your comment:
&gt; So the UK is sending Harpoon missiles to Ukraine now and its confirmed from the UK side.

So where the fuck is the mention of Harpoon AShMs? The ones that the UK has never used in a coastal defense battery?

Now, sadly enough a source a I consider more reliable on the DailyMail:

[Based on earlier deals, I would expect this to be the Sea Spear](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1512837866258419713).

So no confirmation of what type of AShM is being sent, but OSINttechnical is more than knowledable. Now I know you /r/worldnews people don't know shit about military hardware. But here's a hint, a naval Brimstone is not a Harpoon.

So no, I'm not looking to ""walk back"" on my prior statement, as you haven't provided anything regarding the statement around sending Harpoon AShMs. Which would be stupid to announce in the first place, as it'd just tell Russia to park their ships more than 75 miles away from the Ukrainian controlled coast.",594fd6dc6cb44e07a8ae50b54541028a4a45ef36,True,False,,,,,0,1649535657,,0,{},i42stnt,False,t3_ty0lb3,False,True,t1_i42p5o4,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ty0lb3/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_472022/i42stnt/,1649535669,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649506857.0,,,,

But this still leaves me with questions. The main one being, is war going to solve the problem? Will Russia truly be able to win in a way that guarantees Russians live normal lives in Ukraine? It seems like the anti-Russian sentiment has gone up dramatically and understandably so.

As far as I am aware, there is no indication that zelensky is deeply unpopular. There is no indication that Ukraine will collapse due to different factions (which you would expect in a weak puppet government). There are no mass defections to Russia from the Ukraine side as far as I am aware, which you would also expect if what you say is true, that it is the will of the US and not Ukraine.

Do you have proof the 2014 election was a sham, and that the government was unsupported by the people since then? That it is unsupported now? 

Forceful assimilation is a sad thing, but I don’t think it justifies war. (It would be nice to see more links on this like the language law, but I can look it up sometime if not). And neither do nazis. there are nazis in many countries including the US, but you don’t say that it would be right to declare war on the US. And finally on NATO, I find nato declaring an offensive war over crimea impossible. The west does not want a war with Russia, even now when the public war support is higher than in your scenario. I also find it odd to say that russia must at such costs retain territory that it did not control just 8 years ago.",2dd6ef41c3d8f18cc20ed07b3c77b4525f073e89,True,False,,,,,0,1649536628,,0,{},i42v1bi,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i42s4km,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i42v1bi/,1649536647,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649507828.0,,,,

Huh? Those are not mutually exclusive positions at all. A person can be a nationalist about protecting their own territorial sovereignty but not give a shit about other nation's or what goes on there. That is perfectly logically consistent for a nationalist to be self-centered on their own nation's interests and not apply that externally.

However, being a ""leftist"" but supporting autocratic capitalism *is* contradictory.

You have the most facile, American-brained understanding of political science imaginable if your entire view of Conservatism is ""government not doing stuff"" and if government does stuff that suddenly isn't Conservatism? What on earth. You're on a totally different planet. 

Again, there is nothing inherently contradictory about a conservatism and supporting government spending on something. There is, however, an inherent contradiction on calling yourself a leftist but supporting an autocratic capitalist state. 

&gt; I gave you two examples but honestly I can find way more

[The Sea Spear is naval launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_\(missile\)#Naval-launched_Brimstone_Sea_Spear), if you'd spend 10 seconds looking. The short-range(which would be shorter than a aerial launched variant) combined with the ability to use a laser designator would eliminate the need to use and integrate a shore based radar. This makes for a quick-stop gap solution, which is probably why OSISTtechnicals made their statement.

One, a small drag chute like the one in the picture isn’t really “working that hard.”  If you did enough damage to reduce it’s drag by 10%, it just wouldn’t make a meaningful difference to what the chute is intended to do.  And even if this chute failed, the warhead is going to fall onto whatever it’s overhead.  One of the risks of missile interception is that sometimes you shoot down a missile that was going to errantly land in a cornfield, and it instead crashes into a neighborhood.

But more importantly, the damage to the parachute would have to be almost catastrophic.  In my days as a paratrooper, I jumped parachutes that had a surface area of about 960 square feet.  You‘d have to put thousands of .30 caliber bullets through the parachute to add up to 1 square foot.  The math just gets really steep really fast.

And as a bonus 3rd reason, parachutes don’t produce drag quite as intuitively as it seems.  The flow of air through small openings in a parachute can actually end up creating more aerodynamic drag than a solid one.  You will sometimes see chutes designed with small openings that “complicate” the airflow in a way that produces drag.",500cd95afe8225189003b5abc88d108aba583723,True,False,,,,,0,1649543514,,0,{},i43aoms,False,t3_u01ph8,False,True,t1_i4358sa,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u01ph8/russian_military_dropping_bombs_on_parachutes_in/i43aoms/,1649543525,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649514714.0,,,,

I will definetely read up on the bucha situation, i hadnt hears about any massacres.

Regarding propaganda, its goal is tl raise public support, and i like to think if propaganda not directly related to war for this. Soviet propaganda is a great example of this. Theyll often show many people looking fairly similar all working together to achieve one goal, or theyll use some type of person, who may be lazy or greedy, and portray them as ruining for everyone else. Alot of it focused on progress, to produce more, or research more.

here is an example of what i mean

https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-464440413-1024x689.jpg

This contains no facts whatsoever. I believe it simply say ""we smite the lazy worker"",  but i can already feel a quite strong sense of camraderie and belonging through that picture. It makes me imagine being part of something bigger, even if the role i play is small, it is the combined effort that leads us into the future.

It is similar i feel when someone says ""soldier shooting at residential building"", which is factually correct. But its very much contextually wrong, as it clearly aims to cause in you a feeling of disgust for the destruction of this building, even though it may very well be used by the military.

This is also what i mean with not everything being a lie, as far as i know, russian media is heavily regulated, but it does not mean that everything is staged. We lack context and can therefor say we cant form an opinion, the same goes doe ukraine. I believe it is wrong though to assume thar everything russia is posting are lies, as it does lead down a dangerous path. If my enemy always lies, then that must mean that my ally must be telling the truth, if they contradict my enemy 

Another major thing ofcourse is doubt, its not so much about convincing people that you are right, just managing to get you to doubt that the enemy is right goes a long way.

I am so sorry i really wanted to write more but its so late and im very tired, i wanted to respond before i fell asleep though incase i forgot to do it tomorrow haha",6ea91c30e8458da5a27c6290c5293af86c4bdb12,True,False,,,,,0,1649544540,,0,{},i43cyko,False,t3_tu01tm,False,True,t1_i3r2ken,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tu01tm/ukrainian_grad_and_truck_struck_by_precision/i43cyko/,1649544550,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649515740.0,,,,

Ofc you won't see comments like you do in this thread when we get daily videos of Ukrainians bombing Russian military positions in villages, its hypocritical and counter-productive to actually calling Russia out on their BS.",37241b59858567c49a80e1f3dcf87a93bd2f3c15,True,False,,,,,0,1649548673,,0,{},i43lw78,False,t3_tze79d,False,True,t1_i40ww82,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tze79d/russian_backed_separatists_hit_the_contested/i43lw78/,1649548692,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649519873.0,,,,
