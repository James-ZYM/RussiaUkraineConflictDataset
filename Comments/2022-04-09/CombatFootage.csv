He has actually been very open and revealing about a lot of details.

He claimed moral responsibility for MH17 being shot down while oddly denying actual guilt that would hold up in a court basically.

He admitted that most of the ammunition they seized in the beginning of the war was defective ( corrupt and decrepit 2014 Ukrainian army) that’s why they were so reliant on “humanitarian convoys”.

Most revealingly he says that without the Russian hybrid war the whole separatist armed conflict would have “fizzled out like Odessa and Kharkiv”.

He spoke about how even in donbass it was just minor skirmishes between his guys ( agents, assets, Russian ‘holiday soldiers’  and security services personnel) vs. right sector guys and the like.

It’s absolutely insane because I remember you specifically can go back and watch the vice news Russian roulette episodes.

There’s one where some right sector guys were ambushed and killed and thrown in some wooded area. You had pro-Russian people acting like they don’t know what happened but looking back it’s funny how all the people calling shots were basically in synch with russian security forces and military officer directives the whole time.

We didn’t know that.

Even now before the war started, a CIA journalist guy on the team house (navy seal) podcast mentioned how penetrated the SBU is. They had tonnes of pro-Russian cells and anything that Americans told the SBU they expected the Russians to know.

This also lines up with what we know about Putins spymasters being in charge of readying assets and preparing people for the invasion.

I think it was explained that’s why Kharkiv fell? That there were pro-Russian traitors that basically sabotaged the defense.

And the whole operation ranged from bribing officials to setting up alternate politicians, western declassified intel said that after eliminating Zelensky they had a shadow government freshly baked and ready to install.

It’s really good to look at Strelkovs revelations as they do provide insight on past actions and mostly are confirmed with what we know. It also tells us how they likely hoped to see things go with this invasion.

It seemed the “Kharkiv” people’s republic didn’t quite work out though, I’m mixed up but I can’t tell if it was Ukrainian officials pointing out how Kherson or Kharkiv people’s republic operation failed this time.

Either way after the war started CIA journalist spoke about how the Ukrainian intelligence services were finally rolling up all the pro Russian cells and assets they had on “watch and wait” for months. That’s why we saw so many arrests of higher ranked people for treason and some mayors etc. They’d long been fingered.",835695ff0be5655cbb75ca47aa40c6777b5993c7,True,False,,,,,0,1649519289,,0,{},i41p59m,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i40yw68,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i41p59m/,1649519301,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649490489.0,[],text,t2_8m7zk7na,False,False,

*I know that this story was originally written by Andy Rooney who was a correspondent for ""Stars and Stripes"". He was at the airfield when the incident occurred.  Rooney recalled, “I was there when they came back from a raid deep in Germany, and one of the pilots radioed in that he was going to have to make an emergency landing. He had only two engines left and his hydraulic system was gone. He couldn’t lower the wheels and there was something even worse. The ball turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble beneath the belly of the bomber.  Later I talked with the crewmen who survived that landing. Their friend in the ball turret had been calm, they said. They had talked to him. He knew what they had to do. He understood. The B-17 slammed down on its belly and onto the ball turret with their comrade trapped inside.”*",27e0a45f6c51ae367d1795d5272447bb481c8c86,True,False,,,,,0,1649518646,,0,{},i41njqp,False,t3_tzcr9y,False,True,t3_tzcr9y,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzcr9y/the_story_of_the_wwii_ballturret_gunner_who_was/i41njqp/,1649518664,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649489846.0,[],text,t2_2nrljnuy,False,False,

In regards to what Zelensky said, it's one thing to say that and the other to act on it. Plus, what does it mean to support occupiers. There's a big difference between simply obeying Russian soldiers because your life is at stake or actively supporting the in reaching their objective. At the end of the day, these are civilians, it's a wild assumption that the soldiers who are going in to liberate them from Russian invaders are just going in head first and shoot anyone on site for potentially ""supporting Russian soldiers"". It may happen, but there's a low chance of it.

There's a lot of potential scenarios what has happened there, and as you mentioned we may never know the real truth. Maybe they did a massacre, maybe they did shit but not to the extent the media is painting it, maybe some people died from Ukrainian shelling, maybe some rogue soldiers killed their own people. There's a lot of maybes here, but if we take the duck argument, what probably is a duck here is that the Russian side did some bad shit to civilians. Until there's a solid good argument against it, we can take it as the most likely scenario (you're free to think otherwise, of course)

I like to look at the way both sides act to it as well. The Ukrainian side is acting in a way that suits both arguments (either it was a massacre or they'd like to paint it's a massacre), so a bit hard to discern from theirs only. The Russian side either has an issue with their PR (too deep in their propaganda) and is making bad decisions or they actually did it.",68f27da66527d4a6941e43f20f9dd9a6693440d0,True,False,,,,,0,1649518156,,0,{},i41mbzh,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i40zrya,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i41mbzh/,1649518171,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649489356.0,[],text,t2_u3nqf,False,False,

To the best of my knowledge, these groups formed in 2014. Over time, their numbers have changed, but their numbers are generally not advertised, and even if they were, probably shouldn't be trusted as they may be inclined to over-inflate their numbers.

With Russich, as an example, a number of members went with the Wagner Group when they went to Syria (to protect Yevgeny Prigozhin's gas companies).

How many and who went across is unknown.

Some of this might be available on certain social media sites (usually Russian), but I do know that some of the mainstream sites like Instagram have removed their accounts.

The thing is with Russia is that wealth distribution by region is way way more fked up than in any other European country.

Our richest region is greater london, which has a per capita income 3 times greater than the poorest (Northumbria) in Russia the gap between the richest and poorest regions is over 50 times.

For a HE 120mm mortar shell it's 30m defined as 2 shrapnel with enough energy/mass to kill per square meter. 

In reality its a bit more complex and there are actually a number of fancier models proposed how to calculate or define the lethal radius of fragmentation shells. For example: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914720303834](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914720303834) where they stretch the lethal radius for a mortar shell out to 38m. But all the math in the world cant change the fact that its propability based thing. You might be standing up, get a mortar shell to land 15m away from you and walk the concussion off or you might have one landing 150m from you and that one bastard shrapnel piece finds your jugular artery and that's the end for you. 

Anyway, as a rough rule of thumb, as far as I understand.

* 120mm is approx 30m radius
* 155mm is approx 50m radius

For soft targets. If it lands within 1/4 of that distance, roughly, it can even fuck up armored targets without landing a direct hit.",50c55787b19fea02926fa9286136b5f6cbae9a7d,True,False,,,,,0,1649513510,,0,{},i41b97n,False,t3_tz11cf,False,True,t1_i415lcg,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz11cf/footage_of_artillery_strikes_on_russians/i41b97n/,1649513525,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649484710.0,[],text,t2_seytw,False,False,

690,[],False,,SexualToothpicks,,,,,,"So I was pretty surprised that Russia is still engaged in Kharkiv, as I figured when they pulled out of Chernihiv and Sumy, Kharkiv would be next, as it's a similar situation where they're taking significant losses fighting in a suburban area where the defenders have a huge advantage with practically no chance of actually taking the cities.  However, I think I'm seeing the reason why Ukraine hasn't just snowballed down south and pushed the Russians out in Kharkiv after clearing the north.

1 - Russia cannot give up the siege of Kharkiv without exposing the northern flank of their Luhansk offensive, which would be deep in open Ukrainian territory and extremely vulnerable to being cut off and destroyed.  If that happens, Ukraine might even be able to roll up the entire Donetsk front starting from the north. 

2 - Much of Ukraine's forces in the north that liberated Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy are territorial defense units that cannot be easily relocated south, both in terms of political will and their need to stay in the north to ensure Belarus doesn't get testy or Russia doesn't push again, not to mention logistical problems.

3 - Russia could more easily pull troops out of Sumy and send them to Kharkiv or Izyum due to their own internal rail network around Belogorod.  Ukraine's transportation infrastructure in the east of the country has likely taken a beating from artillery and airstrikes, whereas the Russian transport infrastructure has been largely untouched. 

I'll be the first to admit I'm an armchair strategist at best, but does anyone else have any input on the Kharkiv situation?  I'm very interested in discussing it and hearing any input you guys have.

697,[],False,,DJC71AU,,,,,,"There are certain users who are deliberately spreading a whole lot of misinformation, particularly in regards to Ukraine and the Donbas region.  
  
In the interest of clarity, there are three main Russian-backed neo-Nazi mercenary units that have been fighting in Donbas on and off since 2014.  
  
They are:  
  
\- The Wagner Group  
\- Rusich  
\- The Sparta Battalion  
  
These three groups are known to be led by neo-Nazis and far-right ultra-nationalists.  
  
  
**The Wagner Group**  
  
The Wagner Group was formed by Dmitry Utkin, a Russsian who was previously a lieutenant colonel in the GRU special forces.  
  
Utkin's call sign was ""Wagner"", which is a reference to Richard Wagner, Adolf Hitler's favourite composer.  
  
Utkin also has nazi related tattoos - specifically, Waffen SS collar tattoos as well as a Reichsadler tattoo on his chest.  
  
Dmitry Utkin is on the payroll of Yevgeny Prigozhin, aka ""Putin's chef"". Prigozhin is a close associate of Putin, and also funds the St Petersburg troll factory.  
  
Wagner Group initially fought in the Donbas region of Ukraine in support of separatists, however, they have also worked in Syria, Libya and other countries.  
  
They are currently actively involved in the war on Ukraine.  
  
  
  
**Rusich**  
  
Rusich was formed by Alexey Milchakov and Yan Petrovsky, two Russian neo-Nazis.  
  
As a teenager, Milchakov had quite the reputation in St Petersburg. Not only was he a neo-Nazi, but he also achieved some infamy by cutting the head off a puppy, and posting the photos online. These photos can still be found online.  
  
He also wanted other neo-Nazis in St Petersburg to kill stray dogs and the homeless.  
  
Milchakov served time in the Russian military as a paratrooper.  
  
After meeting Yan Petrovsky through The Russian Imperial Movement, they formed Rusich with Milchakov serving as the leader, and Petrovsky as his deputy.  
  
Rusich fought in the Donbas region alongside Russian-backed separatists, where they gained notoriety for mutilating the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. Again, there are photos online.  
  
Petrovsky lived in Norway for quite some time, however, because he had never taken out permanent residency, the Norwegin Government sent him back to Russia.  
  
Ukraine wanted Petrovsky extradited to Ukraine, where they wanted to put him on trial for his crimes in Donbas.  
  
Norway sent him back to Russia.  
  
At times, members of Rusich have worked with the Wagner Group in places like Syria.  
  
They have also continued their involvement in the Rusian Imperial Movement, specifically, the armed wing who are known as The Imperial Legion.  
  
Milchakov and Petrovsky have been involved in training neo-Nazis and far right groups in a training camp located near St Petersburg.  
  
They are currently actively involved in the war on Ukraine.  
  
It was recently reported that Milchakov had been wounded.  
  
  
  
**The Sparta Battalion**  
  
The Sparta Battalion is another neo-Nazi, far-right ultra-nationalist group active in the Donbas region.  
  
They have been involved in fighting since 2014.  
  
Their original leader was Russian born Arsen Pavlov, whose callname was ""Motorola"".  
  
Motorola was killed in 2016 when a bomb exploded in his elevator. There are conspiracies about who killed him.  
  
Vladimir Zhoga (also a Russian neo-Nazi) took control until he was killed in early March 2022.  
  
After Zhoga's death, Russia announced that he would be given the award of ""Hero of Russia"".  
  
Not bad for a neo-Nazi who was killed fighting a war...sorry, ""special operation"" to de-nazify Ukraine.

I hope this helps people.

They didnt fought much according to their doctrine in first few weeks. The fact that they retreated from north to strengthen the south means they are building up for offensive according to their doctrine.

The Russian army in Ukraine is super small compared to what they would be able to mobilize if the US invaded. How could the US be a military threat to Russia?

Their nuclear arsenal negates any threat, even if we can argue that the US is more powerful with nukes and they can level Russia, the whole world will pay.

You can see that the EU countries don’t have the military power as they haven’t been building it for a while now. On the other hand, Russia has allies that don’t like the US and in the event of a US invasion would gladly take Russia’s side.

Not to mention, wars today are through politics and economy, not with troops (if we put aside things like the Middle East, etc.)

**Translation by google, I fixed a couple of errors:**

  
Summary of the LDNR (I don't have any current data on the rest of the front):

  
~~Raisins~~ Izium *(note by me: Izium is Russian for raisins)*: fighting in the area south of the city. No significant changes. Mutual artillery strikes.

  
The Ukies are intensively preparing Slavyansk and Kramatorsk for defense, turning them (together with the long-fortified Karachun) into one big ""fortress"". The Russian military will be asked to once again break its forehead and bleed here.

  
Rubezhnoe. Contrary to earlier statements, the city is not completely under the control of the Armed Forces of the LPR and the Russian Federation. Heavy fighting continues in the city and the surrounding area without much success.

  
Popasnaya is exactly the same picture as in Rubezhnoye.

  
Near Avdiivka - there is no progress. This point has been turned into a fortress, it is useless to storm it with the forces of only ""second-rate"" mobilized battalions of the DPR, as they are trying to do now. Moreover, the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to actively strengthen and continuously throw manpower to replace losses.

  
Marinka - most of the village - is still under the ~~shelters~~ UKRs *(note by me: he says под украми, which google mistakes for под укрытиями - under shelters)*. Otherwise, everything is the same as with Avdiivka.

  
On the Kurakhovsky direction - without significant changes. Kurakhovo itself has been turned into a powerful fortified area and continues to strengthen. Another ""fortress"".

  
In Mariupol - I do not have reliable confirmation of the full control of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the DPR Armed Forces over the Mariupol port. We can only say that the port village has been completely taken and cleared and that our troops have entered the port itself.

  
Fierce fighting continues in the vicinity of Azovstal, and the storming of the plant itself is still a long way off.""Kadyrovtsy"" - strictly in the second line.In the first , almost exclusively the DPR Armed Forces. With appropriate victims. (Every day I get messages: ""so-and-so is killed, so-and-so is wounded."")

  
In general, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces has finally stalled in the Donbas. The continuation of attacks by the Donetsk infantry sometimes brings minor local successes.  
With the regrouping of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, much is not clear. In a week and a half to two weeks, everything will turn green, it will be even more difficult to advance. The time for an attempt to turn the tide of hostilities is running out.",def84e19297f52619572e6d0dd8c6a8cf3b758bc,True,False,,,,,0,1649501190,,0,{},i40pxl5,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t3_tzf5kn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i40pxl5/,1649501200,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649472390.0,[],text,t2_9z5msto9,False,False,

1830,[],False,,FilthyCatfish,,,,,,"\&gt;What indicates that the Russian VKS do not perform a SEAD/DEAD operations or doing them with completely failure? 

There is nothing to suggest that the VKS are not performing SEAD/DEAD, but the fact that the Ukrainians retain aircraft and effective anti-aircraft capability is the real test. If the VKS had performed SEAD/DEAD to a good standard, there would be no further losses of Russian aircraft, for obvious reasons. Of course they are trying, but they have not had anything close to success insofar as to achieve air supremacy or superiority. Thus, they have failed in this regard.

\&gt;Unfortunately, the Russian MoD does not demonstrate the combat results of its aviation group. Also, we do not know the real scale and results of a air strikes on Ukrainian troops. Ukrainians are not interested in showing them.

There is plenty of OSINT available with which we can judge the effectiveness of VKS operations.

\&gt;Many continue to believe that Russian aircraft (multi-role fighters jet and bombers) do not use PGM.

Of course the VKS use PGMs, but they don't have enough to make consistent long-term use of them a reality. Also, as you reference Syria later, I'll add that the vast majority of VKS strike ops in Syria were conducted by dropping unguided munitions and there is plenty of evidence to support this.

\&gt;An important factor in assessing the effectiveness of the VSK is that this is the first conflict in modern times where the attacked side has a relatively powerful and numerous anti-aircraft defense. BukM1 and S-300 may be in some way obsolete, but they are still formidabble, highly mobile air defense systems. I think that Ukrainian air defense has long switched to ambush tactics and time reduced sessions of combat work. With intelligence support, this tactic can bring good results. At least in creating a focal threat to aviation. Also, it's allows to keep AA-vehicles intact for a longer time.

Indeed, this is the first time a relatively modern air force has faced a comparable opponent. That the Ukrainian air defences even retail functioning levels of equipment is testament to the VKS's failure to suppress or destroy them. They made an attempt during the first days of the war, and we saw (and continue to see) losses, not just of the flashy new equipment like KA-52s and SU-35s, but across the range of the VKS inventory. Of course there is value to claiming the kills of the latest and greatest, but the evidence suggests kills are being achieved on older kit too.

\&gt;In terms of accuracy, Glonass is no different from the GPS. At least in this region(Europe). Can you open your argument why glonass cannot be used for delivery a ""true precision strikes"".

In terms of navigation, Glonass is comparable to GPS. In terms of PGM strikes, many Russian PGMs relied on GPS in the terminal guidance phase of the attack. These weapons are not able to use Glonass in this phase, resulting in lower accuracy. 

\&gt;New sighting systems allows to drop bombs with a high accuracy. No as good as JDAM-converted dumb bombs. But 10-15 meters of CEP is pretty achievable.

I think we have different definitions of ""high accuracy"". A CEP of 10-15 meters is not enough when dropping relatively small (up to 500kg) munitions on hard targets, or in urban areas. This results in significant over-claiming (a problem all air forces face), poor effect on target and high levels of collateral damage. All of these have been seen from the VKS in Ukraine and in Syria. The collateral damage, it seems, may even be deliberate.

\&gt;The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane's location together with flight parameters, geoposition of target and environmental parameters (meteo data) and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided bombs.

Yes, it's a bomb sight.

Even if they could take other large cities they then have to leave troops to occupy it, there are 44 million people in Ukraine and Mariupol doesn't even crack the top ten for largest cities in Ukraine. How many occupation forces would you have to leave in each city? What kind if insurrection from left over Ukrainian forces will you have to deal with? If you have to leave thousands of thousands of men behind in each city you only have even fewer men for the next attack and so on.

Plus if they group their entire army together for these attacks that let's Ukraine do the same thing. they might have more attackers but Ukraine will have more defenders as well. We've already seen how well they can defend against the Russians, they spent a month on Kyiv and Kharkiv and didn't get very far, you can't assume they would have more success the next time.

Now Russia could draft more men in Russia, rumor is they might have mobilized 60,000 reservists, but as much as many Russians might support the war the more men you conscript and the more coffins and seriously injured soldiers get sent home to Russia the more public opinion will turn against the war. That's what happened when soldiers started returning, or not returning, during the Afghan war in the 1980's and the Soviets couldn't keep a lid on the dissent, how bad could it get this time around? The true scale of how many casualties they've already suffered hasn't had a chance to sink in yet and you can't hide that people died forever, families notice when loved ones don't return or come back with crippled. You can't tell them not to talk about but after losing a son or father or grandson they don't tend care, families refused to be silenced in the 80's as well, I doubt now will be any different. And it looks like they might have had as many killed in the first month of the war as died *in the entire Russian-Afghan war.*

Sanctions have barely had time to have their effects truly felt by citizens. Unrest can only grow because of those factors, how much remains to be seen but I guarantee the risk is very concerning to Russian authorities.

Russia managed to surround Mariupol at the start of the war by catching Ukraine on the backfoot breaking out of the Crimea peninsula and the fact they already had a frontline opposing the city since 2014, now that element of surprise is gone it won't be so easy to surround the next major city. Russia could turn this into a war of attrition by drastically increasing the size of it's armed forces but whether that is something Putin wants to push forward is debatable. Sadly unless there is some highly unlikely miracle operation to relive them the forces Mariupol will eventually fall. I predict Putin will try and regroup his forces and make a push in the east to see what he can get for around a month or so. He'll have his land bridge to Crimea and most likely a source of water if they can hold some land around Kherson. He'll stamp ""job done"" on that, declare victory and stop all offensive action.

&gt; if Ukraine has the defensive capability to hold out for months, which it doesn’t

With Western support why can't they? Even just using the farms in the west of the country they can easily feed their own populace and they're getting massive shipments of arms in every day. Ironically I think it's Russia that might not be able to keep the conflict going for months, not because thy couldn't but because they don't want to risk more internal dissent.",200b3f4287682ffbce06980eccd48afe7d46c61c,True,False,,,,,0,1649491817,,0,{},i40ebyu,False,t3_tziorh,False,True,t1_i40byjn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tziorh/study_of_wars_mariupol_map_for_4822/i40ebyu/,1649491833,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649463017.0,[],text,t2_ekxnp,False,False,

From the pro-Ukrainian interview with the Ukrainian MiG-29 pilot. According to him, the Russians are actively using anti-radiation missiles, knocking out a  mobile Ukrainian air defense systems. Also, the use of jamming equippment creates certain problems for Ukrainians. Unfortunately, the Russian MoD does not demonstrate the combat results of its aviation group. Also, we do not know the real scale and results of a air strikes on Ukrainian troops. Ukrainians are not interested in showing them. For example, a few days ago one target in Nikolaev was hit by the air-to-surface missile (definitely the PGM). Some photos leaked, but there was not video published. Many continue to believe that Russian aircraft (multi-role fighters jet and bombers) do not use PGM.

An important factor in assessing the effectiveness of the VSK is that  this is the first conflict in modern times where the attacked side has a relatively powerful and numerous anti-aircraft defense. BukM1 and S-300 may be in some way obsolete, but they are still formidabble, highly mobile air defense systems. I think that Ukrainian air defense has long switched to ambush tactics and time reduced sessions of combat work. With intelligence support, this tactic can bring good results. At least in creating a focal threat to aviation. Also, it's allows to keep AA-vehicles intact for a longer time.

&gt;They still have GLONASS but can only use it as far as getting in the right area, not true precision strikes as we in the West understand them.

In terms of accuracy, Glonass is no different from the GPS. At least in this region(Europe). Can you open your argument why glonass cannot be used for delivery a ""true precision strikes"".

&gt;What this all means is that the VKS is forced to fly defensively (low and fast) to avoid air defences, leaving them vulerable to MANPADS and are reliant on ""dumb"" bombs to carry out strikes, which are much harder to drop with any semblence of accuracy from higher altitudes.

New sighting systems allows to drop bombs with a high accuracy. No as good as JDAM-converted dumb bombs. But 10-15 meters of CEP is pretty achievable.Check the operation of Russian Su-24s in Syria. For the Fencer bomb raids (from the altitude 5000+ meters to avoid MANPADs) in Syria they used mostly dumbs bombs and the SVP-24 aiming system. The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane's location together with flight parameters, geoposition of target and environmental parameters (meteo data) and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided bombs.",4a3e097acc7ae35bad70e9f49950027c4418c17a,True,False,,,,,0,1649491740,,0,{},i40e8fw,False,t3_tzaxbc,False,True,t1_i3z1wc2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzaxbc/ruaf_su25_over_amvrosiivka_earlier/i40e8fw/,1649491753,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649462940.0,[],text,t2_cckkr,False,False,

During the Kosovo War in 1998 and '99 large portion of ethic Kosovo Albanians fled the region into neighboring countries, with Macedonia eventually receiving the brunt of the exodus with more then 360000 temporarily settling in the country. This was an alarmingly large number for the central government in Skopje, which predicted and was prepared to take in only about 25000 at most. What was even more concerning for the officials was the fact that in a country whose total population number more then 2 million, with a color pallet of mixed ethic and religious backgrounds, having that many Albanians in the country raised concerns the the more extremist nationalistic groups might start an armed confrontation with the goal being either autonomy or outright independence.

Indeed what the Macedonian government predicted did came in fruition in the form of some former Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army officials moving into northern Macedonia and covertly moving weapons across the border in leu to the now Albanian ethically dominated north.

The National Liberation Army (which was already formed in 1999 but had no prior conformations with neither the military nor the police) in January of 2001 began a large scale offensives and although at first the NLA managed to gain significant portion of the land, through Bulgarian and Ukrainian military support, the Macedonian Army and police forces managed to confine and later push the NLA out of major population centers and into the mountainous countryside.

The conflict would end in early November of that same year with a peaceful diplomatic solution (Ohrid Agreement) calling for the Macedonian constitution to enhance the rights of its Albanian population, and for the NLA to official to hand over all of their weapons and dissolving the movement, ensuring no recaps of the conflict could happen in the future.",e430ba7c4b079514953ee1c25ba7d6aa8fc4c3d4,True,False,,,,,0,1649491342,,0,{},i40dq7a,True,t3_tz382y,False,True,t1_i406olm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz382y/army_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_artillerymen/i40dq7a/,1649491353,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649462542.0,[],text,t2_4zajn6ia,False,False,

And if you want to talk about crimes in the Donbas regions since 2014, open your eyes and take a look at Russian mercenaries (paid for by Putin) have done.

Here's a few groups to look into:

* Wagner Group (Dmitry Utkin)
* Rusich (Alexey Milchakov)
* Sparta Battalion (Vladimir Zhoga)

All three are neo-Nazi mercenary groups, that have been involved in the Donbas region, lead by actual neo-Nazis.

And as an FYI, - Alexey Milchakov (leader of Rusich) graduated from torturing and decapitating puppies, to torturing and mutilating Ukrainian solders. If you look around, you can find actual photos of what they done.

So, when you make a generalised comment like ""won’t admit they don’t know shit about this conflict"", perhaps some people here know a fuck load more than you do.

Feel free to continue making ignorant comments, and others will feel free to continue down voting your ignorant comments.

And for the record, I haven't down voted you.

The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.”
  
Just before landing, the Fortress’s hydraulic system, which was riddled with shell holes, malfunctioned, making it impossible for the pilot to put down the wheels. The emergency hand crank for operating the main landing gear has also been destroyed by enemy fire. The pilot would have to make a belly landing. “There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.”""

They do not believe Russia even has the capacity to be imperialist, due to some fucked up definition that they're using. They've completely accepted Putin's justification for the invasion -- mainly NATO expansion (and a whole bunch of conspiracies). 

After arguing with many of them I've come to the conclusion that their support for Russia solely stems from their weariness, and often hatred, of NATO. Specifically, NATO's own imperialist actions in the past. They absolutely cannot see past this, to the point where they believe the Ukrainian people have no self-determination and that they fight only because NATO has manipulated them to. Basically, they've adopted a contrarian approach to all things NATO.

NATO countries have absolutely caused great harm in their own imperialist wars and meddling.

His birthday is October 7th which he will turn 70. Im sure he is willing to move heaven and earth to use those dates as celebration goals. Which giving a timeline for a war is a recipe for disaster. The main issue is to see if the US and NATO are willing to go against their Intel agencies and supply offensive weapons to Ukraine. My humble opinion is that CIA does not want Ukraine to win, as it will open up a myraid of new issues. Puting an unpredictable, possibly ill Putin in a corner forcing him to use WMDs, or even worse is the actual collapse of the Russian econmy would destabilize a nuclear power, making it strife for abuse and destroy the status quo of global energy distribution.

When training first aid among non-medics, Combat Live Savers in the Army, the same guidance is used but in practice it was much easier to drill infantrymen to always just do high and tight, and we'll put in a more optimal location later - focus on the muscle memory to stop the bleeding and not get caught up in the intricacies of TC3.

I reference him mainly because he calculates his estimates based on sources on both sides so it's a little less biased but obviously has massive data skews on each end of the spectrum. 

[https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/walrus\_cambodiabombing\_oct06.pdf](https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/walrus_cambodiabombing_oct06.pdf) has a nice infographic on the areas bombed by the US, showing that yes bombing occurred mainly in the east of the country but that is the entire eastern side of the country, that was significantly more populated than what was presented. The capital Phnom Penh lies in the east of the country and was heavily bombed as shown in the infographic. The report also mentions Clinton's revelations on actual tonnage of ordinance dropped being significantly higher than what was previously estimated (which is important as tonnage of ordinance dropped is frequently used to estimate the death toll). The bombing also began 4 years earlier than what was previously stated, so factor that in to the civilian death toll as well. 

I think every agrees the war was a fucking waste. The only thing I wish people realize is that in 1944-1945, there really was hope for a independent Vietnam, and the US was leading that hope. Bit of a long read but this is all public information so it's not just me pulling things out of my arse.

Roosevelt made it clear on several occasions that France would not return to Vietnam and that an international trusteeship would be established to help Vietnam gain independence after the war. Roosevelt and Gen. Wedemeyer made significant efforts to counteract British and French operations in Indochina as they speculated (and with hindsight, we know they correctly speculated) that Britain was trying to put France back in power in Indochina (confirmed by Operation Masterdom). 

US operatives from OSS Deer Squad landed in Vietnam to arm and train the Viet Minh, allegedly taking part in a few combat operations together with the Viet Minh against the Japs and even marched with the Viet Minh into Hanoi (Maj. Allison Thomas can be seen in photos with the Viet Minh during the march to Hanoi). 

Lt. Col. Archimedes Patti was in Vietnam to oversea the transferring of POW's into allied hands and goes into a lot of detail about his experiences in his 1981 interview). He mentions the warm welcome he received by the Vietnamese, the terrible way the French treated the Vietnamese (and how the French were actively releasing anti-American propaganda to undermine their influence there). He spoke of how Vo Nguyen Giap (commander of Viet Minh / PAVN forces) visited him at the villa he was staying at and they had a pleasant conversation about the future of Vietnam. When the convo was over, Giap asked Patti to step outside where he was greeted by a 50piece band playing star spangled banner with the flags of the US/Viet Minh/Soviets/China (KMT)/ Britain flying overhead. A photo of Patti can be seen saluting the flag while the Viet Minh stand next to him giving their clenched fist salute (communist salute).

Patti also spoke with Ho Chi Minh several times during his stay and even spent the night at Ho Chi Minh's home going over the draft copy of Vietnam's declaration of Independence to which Patti was taken back when he first read it as it includes part of the US' declaration of Independence

***""All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""***  
***This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.""***

Patti was invited to be on stage during the declaration but he declined for political reasons. He was present in the crowd however during the declaration. This occurred on the 2nd of September. 11 days later, the British had arrived and most of the Americans were gone. The British then went to work dismantling the Viet Minh government in the South to give the French the ability to take over, which they did in a coup d'état on the 24th of September. The combined Japanese, British and French operation pushed the Viet Minh out of power in the south and allowed the French to return to Vietnam.

In January 1946, Ho Chi Minh sent a desperate letter to Truman, basically begging for the US to intervene and stop war from breaking out (https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/ho-chi-minh-truman) .

He was ignored, and unfortunately the rest is history.

The US had every opportunity to help Vietnam (going back as far as 1919 at Versailles when Ho Chi Minh originally asked Robert Lansing in letter for assistance in giving Vietnam independence).

But with the defenders it’s harder to tell.

Now whether victory for Russia can be achieved in a month, that is full occupation of Donbass including Slovyanks and Kramatorsk, depends on the state of the Ukrainian army.

[These are the lifting surfaces](https://static.ukrinform.com/photos/2022_03/thumb_files/630_360_1648296023-911.jpg) on a Tochka. They are primarily for stabilization and orientation control (working in tandem with the grid fins). The lift they generate is small, but the hollow tube of steel which is a missile without fuel or payload is not a heavy object.

&gt;Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought lifting force was entirely thanks to the Bernoulli principle i.e. the shape of a body must be asymmetrical in such a way as to generate lower pressure on one side than the other as the body passes through the air.

You are not misremembering so much as misunderstanding. 

A body *does* need to generate an asymmetric pressure field to generate lift, but it does not need to be asymmetric in order to do this. Flat plates are very capable of producing lift if given an angle of attack. But wings and winglets are not the only sources of lift. For most aircraft ([exception here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body)) the vast majority of lift comes from lifting surfaces. But this is not true for rockets and missiles. Rockets gain lift both from lifting surfaces and from lift generated by aerodynamic forces working on the body itself. [Here is a simplified description of these principles](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/rocket/rktaero.html). 

There is a large caveat to all of this though. Which is the question of how stable the missile remains after releasing its sub-munitions. If you shift the center of gravity backwards -towards the center of lift- it will shorten the static margin of the body and reduce its stability. This occurs when the missile's front-sitting sub-munitions are released. If the center of gravity shifts such that it is entirely behind the center of lift, it will destabilize entirely and begin tumbling wildly. The lifting surfaces on a Tochka are far enough aft that even with a significant CG shift I do not think the missile would fully destabilize (as some people have asserted in this thread). But the reduction in stability combined with any asymmetric forces which might be incurred from releasing the sub-munitions could certainly lead to a somewhat erratic path. Other smaller cluster weapons exhibit fairly significant oscillations on release of their bombs. Whether or not Tochkas also experience this destabilization is unknown.",7ab446f115fa018ed4ff57525d6bfff2280dcb07,True,False,,,,,0,1649472455,,0,{},i3zk1dy,False,t3_tz08ny,False,True,t1_i3z22oe,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz08ny/tonkau_missiles_being_launched_from_the_donetsk/i3zk1dy/,1649472470,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649443655.0,[],text,t2_b02a7,False,False,

Depths of 25-30ft were quite the norm ,some officers went as far as wall papering  the dug out and comandering beds from shelled out houses of the towns in that area.

3179,[],False,,planck1313,,,,,,"This is what Rooney writes in his book:

&gt;The worst kind of censorship has always been the kind that newspaper people impose on themselves. I was not aware of being in any way a propagandist as a reporter for The Stars and Stripes, but there were stories I didn’t write because I didn’t like to think of the bomber crews with whom I spent so much time talking, reading them. Too sad. During the two years I covered the air war, there were half a dozen stories I couldn’t bring myself to write even though it would have been more honest if I had. I remember one in particular.

&gt;The Eighth Air Force had a disastrous day when it bombed Regensburg deep inside Germany, and I was at a base waiting to interview some of the fliers when they came back.

&gt;It was the custom for concerned ground crews and flight crews that hadn’t been assigned to go out that day to gather in front of the control tower shortly before the bombers’ ETA. (Another good time-saving acronym produced during the war: Estimated Time of Arrival. Most acronyms are used by people who think they make them sound knowledgeable when they use them, but there are some that are useful. The British were good at both acronyms and code names. They were responsible for popularizing the use of such words as “Overlord” for D-Day, “Cobra” for a strike to the south after the breakout at Saint-Lô, “Mulberry,” the name for the prefabricated docks towed across the English Channel to the beaches. I wouldn’t be surprised, in spite of their American sound, if the D-Day beaches Juno, Gold, Sword, Omaha, Utah were named by the British. Winston Churchill was referred to cryptically in top-secret memos as “Colonel Warden.”)

&gt;All of us on the ground that day were relieved as specks appeared in the sky over the Channel. As the specks grew to dots and the dots grew to spots, radio reports started coming through and it became certain the ordeal wasn’t over. There were dead and dying men on board half a dozen of the group’s bombers. There was a frantic call from one radio operator. The ball-turret gunner was trapped in the plastic bubble hanging beneath the B-17. The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then returned him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.

&gt;Two of the engines of the B-17 were stopped, about 3,000 pounds of dead weight hanging from the wings. The plane was losing altitude fastand flying at barely 135 miles an hour, close to stall-out speed. The pilot ordered the crew to unload everything on board.

&gt;“Everything!” he yelled in a command that reached the control tower over the radioman’s open microphone. The crew started pitching out machine guns, .50-caliber ammunition tracks, oxygen tanks, and every instrument they could tear loose in an attempt to lighten the load and keep the foundering plane in the air.

&gt;The pilot opened the petcocks on the fuel tanks to drain them down to the last few gallons. This was common practice when a plane was about to crash because it lessened the chance of fire. I think the gas evaporated before it rained to the ground because I never heard of anything catching fire on being dampened by any of it.

&gt;The hydraulic system was spewing fluid where the tubing that conveyed it was shot full of holes. The gas tanks were leaking. Nothing worked. The wheels, folded up into the bomber, could not be brought down without its hydraulic system and a belly landing was inevitable.

&gt;There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.

&gt;I returned to London that night, shaken and unable to write the most dramatic, the most gruesome, the most heart-wrenching story I had ever witnessed. Some reporter.

&gt;The incident has been fictionalized in half a dozen different ways over the years. President Reagan, in one of his speeches, told the story of a gunner trapped in the ball turret. After the rest of the crew had bailed out of the fatally damaged aircraft, the pilot was said to have left the cockpit and gone back to reach down into the ball to take the gunner’s hand in his. As the plane plummeted toward the ground, according to Reagan’s speech, the pilot said, “Don’t worry. We’ll ride this one out together.”

&gt;The story seems to have come, not from an actual incident, but from an old black-and-white movie called A Wing and a Prayer, starring Dana Andrews.

TLDR; 

Germany and Austria are complaining about the economic sacrifice that that would require them having to make.  That in turn is making places like Portugal, Spain, and Greece have a big WTF moment, since Germany and Austria (and a few others) forced them to make some very crushing economic sacrifices following the 2008 financial crash.  As a consequence the duo's resistance is crumbling.

But there's one final holdout to a Russian oil ban - Hungary.  It's said it will veto any such measure, and since the vote in favour needs to be unanimous that would kill any potential ban.  But that in turn would put it in direct opposition to Poland who have long been their ally and a partner in their ""illiberal axis"".  So given the white hot burning Polish hatred of Russia going through with their veto would pretty much turn the Poland - Hungary alliance to rubble.  That in turn would allow the rest of the EU to impose all the punitive measures on Hungary that they've wanted to do due its deeply authoritarian and anti-democratic policies, but can't because they are currently being vetoed by Poland.",00508aaef19e10f4a556a82d3127957fb3cafc97,True,False,,,,,0,1649470011,,0,{},i3zf2bq,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t3_tzf5kn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3zf2bq/,1649470025,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649441211.0,[],text,t2_1hx5yb,False,False,

&gt;A bred-in-the-bones skeptic, Rooney [Andy Rooney, a reporter for Stars and Stripes] ignored the fantastic claims of enemy damage and focused instead on the boys in the bombers. It was his job, he thought, to tell their story, a story “buried under the damnably cold heap of statistics the Allies are trying to pile higher than Axis statistics.”37 But there were, he conceded later, stories that were “too sad”38 to report. One in particular lived in his mind.

&gt;While Rooney and some other reporters were waiting in front of a control tower for a squadron of bombers to return, word spread that a ball turret gunner was trapped in his plastic bubble underneath the plane. “The gears that rotated the ball to put the gunner in position to shoot and then return him to the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret gunner was caught in a plastic cage.” 

&gt;Just before landing, the Fortress’s hydraulic system, which was riddled with shell holes, malfunctioned, making it impossible for the pilot to put down the wheels. The emergency hand crank for operating the main landing gear has also been destroyed by enemy fire. The pilot would have to make a belly landing. “There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the runway and the belly of the bomber.”

&gt;Rooney returned to London that evening, unable to write the most dramatic and ghastly story he had ever witnessed.

I think the question is whether Putin can actually afford to keep going for years.  On one the one had we have the increasing effect of economic sanctions.  On the other, we have the fact that he's sold all of this to Russia as something that shows how strong they are -- if you've seen any of the state TV broadcasts they're all talking in completely unrealistic terms about annexing Ukraine. 

The longer this drags out, the more his promise to make Russia seem strong blows up in his face.  And sanctions will make the war even more unpopular.  

What's concerning is that he's closing all of his off ramps in terms of being able to stop short of total annexation.  I don't think he can just take Donbas and stop with the expectations he's built, even assuming he's capable of taking Donbas at this point (which is very questionable).

I don't follow. Calling them Ukrainians gives the individuals and the side they're fighting for all the glory, without running the risk of helping propagandize a hate group.

&gt; If the ""Azov's ideology"" is so bad and should be scrutinized, wouldn't it be better to title the footage of Azov as Azov footage and not Ukrainian footage?

Precisely no. Everything about these videos portrays Azov in a positive light. These all portray them as performing courageous acts, fighting and dying bravely. Noble. Respectable. Worthy of admiration. It's 100% positive vibes ans 0% ideology, and the viewer has no reason to suspect that they're a hate group. The viewer is more likely than not to think that the organization is ""good"", and they really have no incentive to research the validity of that belief.

&gt; Wouldn't naming it as just Ukrainian make it the positive propaganda you are talking about?

It's all propaganda, but at least everyone (not in Russia or Belarus) can agree that the Ukrainians are the good guys here. Let Azov propaganda feed the greater good instead of glorifying themselves, and by proxy, their ideology.

&gt; The amount of ""brainwashing"" that goes on in is a lot less than what people claim it to be

I'm not arguing that ideological indoctrination is widespread, but this type -- the hate-group type -- doesn't need many people to fall prey to still be extremely damaging to societies.

I want to point out, too, that I'm not only talking about Azov propaganda working to promote Azov. Their propaganda can be used by any group that shares that ideology.

There was no time for Europe and NATO to react as it was over immediately. 

Putin was much more calculating before and had the record to prove it. Here is how he has done in conflicts before this invasion:

Chechnya - won
Georgia - won
Crimea - won
Donbass - won
Syria- won

Also Russian economy significantly strengthened despite the corruption.

Now let’s see his calculations for this invasion:

Invade a country whose military doubles the invasion force and more than triples it after mobilization

Expect the government to fall immediately 

Expect the UA military to change sides

Expect Ukrainians to meet Russian troops with flowers as liberators

Expect sanctions to be mild

How would a person even of average intelligence really expect all this? But let’s say somehow he does. Anyone who is about to start a military campaign knows to expect not only what should happen, but also what could happen. What is his contingency plan? Military defeat, stronger nato and collapse of Russian economy?

This is not what Putin from earlier would have done.

3275,[],False,,VerdocasSafadocas,,,,,,"So right now Putin has roughly one month to capture Donbass before Russia's victory day. That to me is very unlikely to happen and I'll explain why: 4th Tank Division, 47th Tank Division and  3rd motorized got depleted taking Izium. They were able to push a bit further but they seem to have completely stalled. Russians are now pushing whatever they can through the northwest Izium bridge in order to keep going through two separate corridors covering both main highways. It is unclear to me how many men they are able to gather but it seems to not be enough, even if some of these reinforcements are pretty elite like the 1st guards tank army. A lot of troops are also tied up in the south to either garrison occupied territories and establish a front line there and low chance of further reinforcements coming from the Kyiv front (armies fighting in the north western front are not fit for combat anymore and on the north east it seems like low morale or refusal to fight might be happening). So with one month to go Russia will have to necessarily push with what they currently have. Is it doable? Eventually it might be, because for some reason there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency on the Ukrainian side in reinforcing these areas. 81st on the left and 95th on the right took a beating over the last month and won't be able to hold on. There seems to be reports of finally fresh Ukrainian troops and equipment arriving to Krasnopavlivka and Kharkiv but we'll have to see if it's enough. However, Russians finally seem to have realized that just pushing large convoys into a main objective (Barvinkove and Slovyansk in this case) without securing ground and villages as they go leaves them wide open for ambushes and taking every settlement one by one will be a grind. So my argument is that one month won't be nearly enough to reach these objectives, much less secure all of Donbass. And while by the 9th of May we can call this a Ukrainian victory on all fronts, it won't help the country as I feel like Putin won't stop until he accomplishes something that can be called a victory for Russia, even if it takes years to do so. Hope I'm wrong in this assessment and the Ukrainian army is able to outright defeat Russia on the eastern front by putting all the stuff they are getting from the West to good use and mounting a serious counter offensive through Kharkiv much like they did in the North.",0f9dd167973613d9f0c784f1353823b4737356e6,True,False,,,,,0,1649468783,,0,{},i3zciha,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t3_tzf5kn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3zciha/,1649468796,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649439983.0,[],text,t2_7f6hxrva,False,False,

Wouldn't that be the exact opposite of what you are arguing for? 

&gt;Extremist recruitment doesn't begin with the ideology, it starts with the positive propaganda.

If the ""Azov's ideology"" is so bad and should be scrutinized, wouldn't it be better to title the footage of Azov as Azov footage and not Ukrainian footage? Wouldn't naming it as just Ukrainian make it the positive propaganda you are talking about?

The amount of ""brainwashing"" that goes on in is a lot less than what people claim it to be, people aren't joining the military or a militia and slowly become radicalized into being extreme left/right, they either are already radicalized and are joining because their ideology matches with the military/militia.

People that says with huge confidence ""Putin will never stop his plan to retake Ukraine and even baltic states, and he'll escalate more and more in the future"".

He's not changed in terms of mentality, he just reached that level of power and confidence (and delusion) that made him thinking that he could repeat what he did in crimea on a larger scale, so doing outrageous military and political moves without facing major consequences. This led him to commit this massive blunder as your rightly called it. 

But if you think about this blunder, if in 2014 NATO and EU reacted quickly to the crimea crisis as they did now, taking Crimea would've had been seen as a massive blunder too.

The stroling part might have been in eastern Ukraine tho highly doubt they thought they'll be welcomed with open arms in Kiev area 

The whole tying down thing is exactly what we did in the first gulf War with two marine divisins holding Iraqi royal guards on the coast while other units carried on, had the marines not done that I feel we would've suffered some casualties, the only difference between that and this is, mainly weapons and the Ukrainians actually confronted ( artillery mostly and ambushes) the Russians while the Iraqis well lol you know the story. But if they never tied down these guys we would've seen a huge massive offensive that would've annihilated more Russians troops if the guys from mauripool and donbass front were able to freely move and all this fight would've been over for Russia a month ago, remember they're operating with roughly 190-220k troops and not all of them are infantry or front line soliders 

For some odd reason they weren't striking weapons depots and weapons that were coming from Poland before such as the Turkish drones and javelines, but now we've seen that change I know of atleast 4 strikes on weapons depots and another strike in a railway west of Ukraine that was bringing in some ammunition and weapons, the Russians seem to have moles I'm Ukraine intelligence and military.

The problem with this reasoning is that it works both ways. The units in the north were some of the most elite units that Russia has and could have been put to great use in the south or east. Remember they essentially had the element of surprise at the start.

Pulling them out now also doesn't make a lot of sense if tying up troops was the plan. Now those troops are free to be redeployed, when they would have been busy on a costly campaign to liberate the north, which they now essentially got for free. Russia paid a heavy price for what they captured in the north and then just gave it up. 

&gt; Russia is losing badly why do we need to send Ukraine arms then ?

Nobody serious is saying that Russia is losing badly in the sense the war is about to be over. Most that I follow are predicting a protracted war of attrition in which case additional supplies are essential for the Ukranians.

&gt; but it makes no sense that about 14K guys were supposed to take a city of 3 million people, especially without an air campaign or strikes by the iskander missile,

Yes, which is where the most criticism of the Russian plan is coming from. They did do missile strikes and an air assault.",f7c1ca57dd77e1a63466606e563666d86276cef2,True,False,,,,,0,1649466888,,0,{},i3z8h7n,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i3z6hgl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3z8h7n/,1649466901,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649438088.0,[],text,t2_9d8n4,False,False,

Resupplying these units to a usable state would take months, not exactly fitting the timeframe Putin has supposedly set out for the invasion to conclude",453f858a9f6fa072087cf9a1f6b63b6fcaf01228,True,False,,,,,0,1649465576,,0,{},i3z5r5f,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i3z27my,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3z5r5f/,1649465594,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649436776.0,[],text,t2_1pmydjq2,False,False,

So basically a badly mauled unit coming from Kyiv/Chernihiv/Sumy won't be nearly as responsive to enemy threats or opportunities, much more likely to break and run in the face of enemy fire, and if it's particularly bad, they might even go AWOL or be the cause of a mass rout of other low morale forces.

Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought lifting force was entirely thanks to the Bernoulli principle, i.e. the shape of a body must be asymmetrical in such a way as to generate lower pressure on one side than the other as the body passes through the air.

Firstly, due to VKS's failure to perform SEAD/DEAD, they don't have air supremacy (or even superiority) in many areas, leaving their ground-attack aircraft and helos vulnerable to interception, either from what's left of Ukraine's airforce or from ground-based systems. As such, they are forced to fly low because to loiter at altitude is often to invite an attack from air defences.

Second, Russia has a very limited stockpile of precision guided munitions (PGMs), meaning that they simply don't have enough accurate weapons to conduct meaningful attacks from high altitude.

At high speed they induce less drag than a comparable steering fin. They are deployed throughout the entire flight of most weapon systems which use them. You can see [here](https://i1.wp.com/missilethreat.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tochka-u-ru-mod-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1) and [here](https://i1.wp.com/missilethreat.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tochka-2.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1) that the grid fins on a Tochka-U are deployed at launch. The only time which grid fins act as brakes is in transonic flight, something which SpaceX does take advantage of, but which is irrelevant to a super-sonic SRBM. And even on Falcon, grid fins are primarily used as control surfaces. So once more, grid fins are control surfaces, not air brakes.

As per why a low-density spent booster might travel further than a high density warhead... your example of a grape and paper ball is close. However in this case, a grape and paper airplane would be more accurate. The booster has lifting surfaces. Between the lift generated from those surfaces and body-lift, it's quite reasonable that the lighter booster would glide further than a warhead on a purely ballistic trajectory.

Basically a real life version of keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

Sadly as in any group of people in society at large you will find racism and hatred in some members of any unit anywhere in a military. That's probably the situation azov finds itself in today, those types of views aren't widely tolerated but some might still have them.

Since by all accounts the leadership has been totally replaced and extremist views are not tolerated in it I think that was probably the right call as distasteful as it might have been to not come down harder on them initially. So assuming the above is generally true I'm not sure how we should view azov today, the roots of the unit are firmly entrenched in racist ideology. However if those ideals really are no longer acceptable in the unit and the leadership has been purged I don't know when it crosses some theoretical line where they no longer stand for that or if they will always be tainted in some way.",ed7efc69f862aa266b1738f261bd187d65ee2bf0,True,False,,,,,0,1649460314,,0,{},i3yueo6,False,t3_tzfnkl,False,True,t3_tzfnkl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzfnkl/is_this_sub_is_being_used_for_neonazi_propaganda/i3yueo6/,1649460331,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649431514.0,[],text,t2_ekxnp,False,False,

""Collins, and other military experts, attribute the astonishing turn around to a “herculean effort” in barely six years by Ukrainian military leaders, coupled with millions of dollars of training and military equipment from an international group of countries, led by the United States, along with the U.K., Canada, Germany and Lithuania.

In 2014, Ukraine’s defense minister said the country had 6,000 combat-ready troops. Today, Ukraine’s army numbers around 170,000 active duty troops, as well as 100,000 reservists and volunteer Territorial Defense Forces.

“Boy they were motivated to defend their country and they were taking the steps to develop,” said retired Major General Tim McGuire, who was deputy commander of U.S. Forces in Europe from 2016-2018.""

Part of the reason the Russia was able to capture the Crimea and the so-called Donbas region in the south-east was that Ukraine’s army relied on untrained conscripts with little training and experience. Things could have been worse had not thousands of volunteers, and militias helped in the war effort.

In 2016, then-president Petro Poroshenko asked for senior defense advisors from the U.S., Canada, the UK, Lithuania and Germany to advise the country on how to bring its armed forces up to NATO standards.

Gen John Abizaid, the former head of U.S. forces in the Middle East, was appointed as advisor to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry. To assist him, Abizaid picked Collins, a decorated former U.S. Army Special Operations commander who served in Iran and Afghanistan before becoming director of the Modern War Institute at West Point, the nation’s top military academy.

The U.S. had been conducting training exercises with Ukraine for a number of years, with names like Sea Breeze and Rapid Trident. But the intensity dramatically picked up, with up to five battalion (roughly 400-500 men each) being trained a year.

Since 2014, U.S. military advisers have trained more than 27,000 Ukrainian soldiers, U.S. officials say. Training included everything from “basic fundamentals” to the importance of camouflage and dispersion tactics and cyber operations.

It also included training for Ukrainian units at the Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany. “That's where we do our realistic, largescale training exercises replicating the rigors of combat,” said McGuire.

An entire Special Forces branch was created from scratch. Training was done at tactical troop level to senior advisors within ministries.

“ The ultimate mission of the Green Berets is train the trainers. Their job is to work with indigenous forces. That's their classic mission. And I think what you're watching in Ukraine is how that mission truly paid off,” said Roger Pardo-Maurer, a former Special Forces officer who was also the top official for Latin America at the Pentagon. “Our tactics, our training, our organization, our system, our weapons, they picked it all up,” he added.

“Our fighter pilots have been telling everyone for years that the Ukrainian Air Force is pretty good,” the head of the California National Guard, Maj Gen David Baldwin, said in a recent interview after hosting Zelensky at a California Air National Guard base in September.

Over time, the Ukrainian armed forces established their own trainers the U.S. and its allies took on a more advisory role. The Ukrainians also gradually acquired what McGuire called “the intangibles that I believe are really what sets a military apart - the importance of professionalism, of discipline, of leadership, of initiative in the chain of command.”

“At the end of the day, it comes back down to the equipment only works if you've got a disciplined, well-trained, well-led, motivated military that can use it,” he added.

Western military teaching encourages lower ranking troop commanders to use their initiative in order to be ready to give expedient battlefield orders when necessary.

“The training and advice spread to every level, pretty much across the board,” said Collins. “This cultural shift, combined with eight years of fighting (southern separatists) in the Donbas, has created a generation of combat-ready officers,” he added.

The formation of Territorial Defense Forces in Ukraine, has also boosted morale, as well as valuable human intelligence in towns and villages.",e23205d43a7a9f2dbc696565e2f77ca034d793ce,True,False,,,,,0,1649460117,,0,{},i3ytyno,False,t3_tzf5kn,False,True,t1_i3yrg7d,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzf5kn/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_492022/i3ytyno/,1649460130,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649431317.0,[],text,t2_984lfeez,False,True,

However they decided it would be better to integrate them with the army and slowly push out the most problematic of people instead of disbanding it and having a few thousand angry, unemployed and battle hardened people bitter against the Ukrainian government floating around out there doing god knows what. Basically a real life version of keep your fiends close and your enemies closer.

Since by all accounts the leadership has been totally replaced and extremist views are not widely tolerated in it I think that was probably the right call as distasteful as it might have been to not come down harder on them initially. So assuming the above is generally true I'm not sure how we should view azov today, the roots of the unit are firmly entrenched in racist ideology. However if those ideals really are no longer acceptable in the unit and the leadership has been purged I don't know when it crosses some theoretical line where they no longer stand for that or if they will always be tainted in some way.",3adeca1401548685f888968c98d522a44d60477f,True,False,,,,,0,1649460103,,0,{},i3ytxhr,False,t3_tzfnkl,False,True,t3_tzfnkl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tzfnkl/is_this_sub_is_being_used_for_neonazi_propaganda/i3ytxhr/,1649460115,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649431303.0,[],text,t2_ekxnp,False,False,

It’s also exceedingly funny watching you think your post has any perspective.. Like the height of comedy.. Would you like to talk about the time the UK had ZERO aircraft carriers? Was it a better part  of a decade? It was.. Don’t forget the most vaunted features the Royal Navy has chosen for UK’s future.. The new models are non nuclear and don’t have steam catapult viability while including the ridiculous and dated and frankly too fucking sad “ski jump” construction.. F-35’s will have to be VTOL models that waste range to take off, the carriers themselves are abysmally small and their air wing is also.. The force projection ability between a US carrier and a UK one is not even comparable.. A modern UK carrier has an air wing of 36 F-35’s whereas a US carrier generally has an air wing of 65-90 but can retain upwards of 120-130 aircraft. That includes a large amount of support aircraft that simply don’t fit on a UK carrier and this drastically limit’s it’s force protection and projection capabilities. Size comparison, crew size, internal storage are widely different, UK has 9 decks US has 25… Not to mention the US has another 7 or 8 smaller carriers to ferry entire Marine Corps MEU’s around when the UK has exactly ZERO. Lastly there are 11 San Antonio amphibious transport docks to the UK’s two and those of course as you would expect have size discrepancies not in favor of the UK as well.

As for whether they're going to win outright, Great question and I'd like to think that they could do well if they broke up the combined area Russia gets when Mariupol falls, but I'm not sure about the east.

At the same time I'm hopeful just from the nature of the war so far, trends and great analysis/info from ISW, Pentagon etc.

War divides people into one of two camps, so I don't exactly see any compelling evidence to make me question who is the aggressor in this war. UA didn't deploy 200K+ soldiers and mercenaries into Russian territory. UA being the same country trying to side with the west and NATO, as their population has requested (a majority of them at least).  


Even if you're an ethnic Russian in the west or NATO, surely people can view evidence and make an independent conclusion without viewing specific propaganda. That is one reason why this sub-Reddit is valuable. Some videos are propaganda, but others are purely documentation of war. Unless UA soldiers are geolocated to RU territory, it's clear a foreign aggressor is in the wrong as there's been no evidence I'm aware of, that would warrant an invasion and war to the death between these two countries. Without a paranoid Putin and his autocratic rule, RU and UA would have been able to work on a peaceful relationship and even trade partner despite any EU or NATO affiliations.

&amp;#x200B;

Putin is so paranoid about NATO aggression, he's trying to include a threat from NATO as an excuse that forced his hand. However, the US and therefore NATO does not desire war with Russia; if the US wanted to invade RU so bad, they would have entered this war as soon as the opportunity/excuse of an invasion occurred. The US knows it would require total war on the scale of WWIII to conquer RU, and the two younger generations in the US certainly don't want a WWIII even if RU and China threaten the US's status of largest economy and largest military. There are likely more aggressive individuals within the older generations (those in power for the most part), but their US constituents wouldn't support going to war, especially after just escaping a 20-year war in Afghanistan,",d3b4e3fefafb5a3402a275e639cb79878c2ba9d0,True,False,,,,,0,1649458383,,0,{},i3yq08q,False,t3_tz08ny,False,True,t1_i3w4nel,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz08ny/tonkau_missiles_being_launched_from_the_donetsk/i3yq08q/,1649458402,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649429583.0,[],text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,

In any case we are not talking about biplanes here, but about a missile.

The booster at the moment of warhead deployment travels at 1200 m/s, the warhead deployment happens at 2250 meters.

So lets say the booster slows down by 50% (to 600 m/s) within a second (as it has less than 2 seconds before it hits the ground). Which is by the way impossible, but lets use it as an example.

That is -61g force on the booster right there. That's absurd isn't it? Especially if we consider that it happened within less than a second by nothing else than airbrake and tumbling. That goes beyond absurd straight into the realm of impossible. At the same time, at -61g the booster would disintegrate in the air.....even if it was made out of titanium!

See the problem? There is simply not enough time to for the drag/lift to have the effect you want it to have. We are talking about an equivalent of an hearth beat for the missile to shed majority of its momentum and alter its trajectory, without engine and thus any thrust to assist with that. 

And that's not happening on this planet.",47b06ce0df9d5fc117aa21d72e4491c2d97b53f8,True,False,,,,,0,1649454043,,0,{},i3yfruh,False,t3_tz6lcd,False,True,t1_i3y6mni,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i3yfruh/,1649454056,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649425243.0,[],text,t2_frfob,False,True,

Maybe the faulty memories of people have led them to believe in the truthfulness of a fictional T.V scenario that they saw as kids decades ago?

&gt;In this sense, Steven Spielberg's 1985 TV drama, ""The Mission,"" part
of the Amazing Stories series, is more self-aware. It focuses, in spite of a
surface realism, on the B-17 as those of us too young to be in the war
knew it best, as a model, as a drawing. The plane is returning from an
aborted mission, its landing gear out, two engines gone, and the ball turret
gunner stuck in his turret, sure to be crushed when the plane has to
make a belly landing. The gunner is saved when he manages to add to
a drawing of the B-17 a set of obviously cartoon wheels, wheels which
then magically appear on the real plane. (182)

5032,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,,,,"1. You need to bring in boats large enough to transport things.  You need ships with cranes and large, reinforced, holds to support the equipment required for a large group of mechanized troops.    Does Russia even have military or convertible cargo vessels capable of being loaded into the Dnieper? What is the habour like?  is there mines? Are the facilities secure? 

2. Boats are expensive.  Losing them isn't exactly like losing a packet of peanuts.  Russia already lost an alligator class ship in a completely controlled environment much farther from enemy lines. They cost tens of millions if not hundreds of millions.  Also, you lose whatever they were carrying.  Russia immediately stopped using ships for re-supply in the theatre after that happened.  They only have one other class ship left if I'm not mistaken. 

3. Boats require trained people.  Does Russia have the logistics equipment and personnel available in Kherson to offload? 

4. Boats can be (but not always) more difficult to load/unload cargo. Often they're actually better, especially for long distances, but that is usually in a non-combat situation.   Boats can be targeted like all the other transport equipment that Ukraine is targeting. 

5. There is also distance to consider.  Are they going to Kherson from Crimea?  From my understanding Russia DOESN'T control the outlet into the Dnieper all the way to Kherson, exposing their ships to enemy fire if they come from Crimea.  If they're just crossing the Dnieper, where are they loading?  Is there a port there to load the ships?  How is the cargo getting to that port on the south side of the river and then loading? 

6. Russia is having trouble meeting basics like food and ammunition for their troops with Rail and trucks.  You think they're going to be better once they switch to a much more limited ship-based re-supply in a contested river area? 

I'm not saying it is impossible I'm saying it is unlikely to be a solution.  If they lose the bridges, the supply situation becomes desperate.",6640e61f74b90a7d2d746771dbbc4765f7fb0c28,True,False,,,,,0,1649452351,,0,{},i3ybmdg,False,t3_ty0lb3,False,True,t1_i3y2gn7,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ty0lb3/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_472022/i3ybmdg/,1649452370,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649423551.0,[],text,t2_4mryd,False,False,

---
""Okay everyone, let's talk about what we saw. What was a big issue in their workspac-... er, armored vehicle? Yes, exactly correct Tim, there was no organization.

See how chaotic their working environment is when there's no organization? Abu Ridhwan could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he had practiced always keeping his spare magazines in the same place so he didn't have to look for them, and Abu Abdullah would have gotten the rockets he needed faster if he had a specific place they should be and had labeled them so that Ridhwan could find them. If their space had been more organized, Abu Hajaar would have known where he should fire from to not hit Ridhwan with hot brass and would have been able to better synchronize with his coworkers. Like I always say: when your *workspace* is chaos, your *work* is chaos. 

Next slide please, Margaret.

Now, organization effects how leaving goes too! Imagine going home on Friday and realizing you forgot something you needed! Our gang experienced this as well. Their exit from the vehicle would have gone a lot smoother if they had all of their items organized. Remember ACE guys? They simply could not ASSESS the situation, COLLECT the necessary equipment, and EXECUTE the plan when they didn't know where anything was.

Now, can anyone think of someone who might have benefited from being able to ACE the exit? Yes John, that's possible. The driver might have gotten out if they were better organized, but we didn't really see what happened there, so we don't know. Who else? Tim, what about you? Yes, Abu Abdullah wouldn't have forgotten his RPG if he had been better organized, good one. There's another one that I'm really looking for. Any other thoughts?

Yes! Great one, Sarah! Abu Ridhwan really would have benefited from ACEing this situation. If he had been more organized, he might have remembered to bring along his first aid kit when he exited, or maybe even a plate carrier, if he had been more organized. That certainly would have helped him achieve his and his company's goals!

In the end, the problem our gang struggled with was that none of them were willing to take the personal initiative to treat their workspace, their coworkers, and themselves with respect by practicing proper organization. 

And that's why you need to label your damn food in the shared fridge, Gary.""",0f145f49bc8cdb52fd49022a220dada027037e1e,True,False,,,,,0,1649451967,,0,{},i3yaobg,False,t3_tz5ljh,False,True,t1_i3xs465,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz5ljh/azov_fighter_manages_to_sneak_up_and_destroy_a/i3yaobg/,1649451985,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649423167.0,[],text,t2_e5tbdqpp,False,False,

Normally, the nose is just a hollow ogive cap, with a flat nose underneath it. This nose readily deformed upon impact, but not as well as a HESH warhead. Still instant action fuzing, but sligtly better blast. 

Now, the nose actually contains a small EFP lens. As a result, the weapon has a very modest armor penetration ability, mostly there to help defeating walls and light vehicles.

I know, i said that already like three times. The angle of attack is 78 degrees.

The speed is 1200 m/s at approach, the 9N123K warhead is deployed at 2250 meters, at which point the booster has less than 2 seconds to overcome its momentum at an angle of attack of 78 degrees.

If we involve the drag lift coefficient, its entirely plausible for the booster to continue on its trajectory.

What is far less plausible is the booster shedding and altering its momentum due to drag/lift in less than 2 seconds.

of a control tower for a squadron of bombers to return, word
spread that a ball turret gunner was trapped in his plastic
bubble underneath the plane. “The gears that rotated the ball
to put the gunner in position to shoot and then return him to
the position that enabled him to climb out and back up into
the aircraft had been hit and were jammed. The ball-turret
gunner was caught in a plastic cage.”

&gt;Just before landing, the Fortress’s hydraulic system, which was
riddled with shell holes, malfunctioned, making it impossible for
the pilot to put down the wheels. The emergency hand crank
for operating the main landing gear has also been destroyed by
enemy fire. The pilot would have to make a belly landing.
“There were eight minutes of gut-wrenching talk among the
tower, the pilot, and the man trapped in the ball turret. He
knew what comes down first when there are no wheels. We all
watched in horror as it happened. We watched as this man’s
life ended, mashed between the concrete pavement of the
runway and the belly of the bomber.”

I heard of Russian aviators who threw Chechen prisoners, screaming, out their helicopters. There were rapes, but it was hard to know how many because women were too ashamed to report them. One girl was raped in front of her father. I heard of one case in which the mercenary grabbed a newborn baby, threw it among each other like a ball, then shot it dead in the air.Leaving the village for the hospital in Grozny, I passed a Russian armored personnel carrier with the word SAMASHKI written on its side in bold, black letters.

Absolutely. By the end of its flight, the booster segment is mostly hollow. The majority of its mass comes from the solid rocket fuel, which by that time is completely spent. The Tochka-U does not have a detachable warhead - if it's armed with [cluster munitions](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/946437980732678226/962033457826005042/unknown.png?width=978&amp;height=635), as it seems to be the case here, they will be release. Those cylinders are completely solid and will travel closer to the original trajectory (i.e. closer to what it would be in a vacuum) than the rest of the rocket body.

&gt;maybe translate is mixing the subtly of what is north east of what

Yeah, it's not a good translation. What the original says is that the *wreck* of the rocket is oriented such that it's front is facing east-northeast.

&gt;Even if the drag was identical, the lighter object would travel less distance as it has less kinetic energy.

Exactly.

&gt;Also the booster has air breaks on so it isnt going to take a ballistic trajectory anyways

Right, but at the point where separation of ordnance is happening, they won't induce a significant deviation from the original trajectory, simply because there isn't enough time.",0517a0052011aaf96478df923905e5d97deb81d2,True,False,,,,,0,1649451010,,0,{},i3y89q6,False,t3_tz6lcd,False,True,t1_i3y2l0v,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i3y89q6/,1649451026,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649422210.0,[],text,t2_5acfz,False,False,

There’s a few flaws with this argument. First, I doubt they did everything they could to anger Russia - it sounds like 1) their main goal was to anger Russia and 2) like their disagreement was one-sided. There’s a super low chance this is true. If you look further in history, they have a fucked up one. And although they may not like Russia as a ruling country, usually countries in that situation wish to be independent and not simply wish to anger another country.

Second, let’s say they did it to anger Russia - it’s their fucking country. How can that be used as a good reason to invade? Russia said a few times (aside of their nazi argument) that the problem is Ukraine is anti-Russian. So what? Some countries don’t like each other and they don’t start a war because of it.

In this system, officers, not NCOs, are the primary trainers of the platoon. In order to prepare these lieutenants, cadets usually attend four- or five-year military academies that more closely resemble a combination of the U.S. Military Academy and the Basic Officer Leaders Course. As soon as a new lieutenant graduates from an academy and takes command of their platoon, they are expected to immediately begin training and maintaining discipline. Soviet lieutenants fill the leadership, planning, training, and disciplinary roles of both a U.S. platoon leader and platoon sergeant.

&gt; Booster falls faster than cassettes separated from it due weight/drag.

Since when drag makes thing fall faster you clown?

*The faster the parachute falls, though, the more drag it creates. The drag force resists the downward movement of gravity, pushing the parachute back up. As the parachute falls, the drag increases until it just balances out the pull of gravity.*

Drag is cousin to a lift, **drag makes things fall SLOWER**!

Just like in a car, too much drag prevents you from going faster, the same happens in the air. Drag makes you go slower and generates measure of lift on its own.

As for the weight, simple check will tell us that weight helps to maintain momentum and makes it difficult to change or overcome said momentum.

If the Tochka came from the east, the booster still had plenty of momentum to continue west after the cluster munition was deployed. Especially if we take into account that Tochka comes at 78 degrees at the speed of 1200 m/s weighting 1800 kg.

The booster is sure as hell continue on its direction from where it came from, past the impact area. So again, if the missile came from the **WEST** the booster would continue in an **eastward** direction. But it didn't, since the booster is west of the impact area.

Also, this is the cluster warhead that was used.

How come there are no impacts west of the boosters, when the cluster warhead deploys in a 360 degrees manner?",9ba715e000fe8421418d91bfe7ffda3a75432297,True,False,,,,,0,1649448430,,0,{},i3y1rq3,False,t3_tz6lcd,False,True,t1_i3xt5fm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz6lcd/possible_origination_of_the_tochkau_strike/i3y1rq3/,1649448441,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649419630.0,[],text,t2_frfob,False,True,

This is what Putin has always wanted, hence the invasion of the Crimea in 2014. 

I don't understand how you can possibly believe that Russia is in any position of strength here. If Russia takes the Donbass, it will only be to negotiate from a ""position of strength"". Ukraine will not give up this region, especially seeing the atrocities committed by the Russian army in the occupied areas. Russia cannot hope to win a protracted conflict. It will go broke. The best that they can hope for is a declared autonomy for the LNR and DPR and to declare victory. 

My dude. Russia sent in the SPETZNAZ and the VDV. These are considered to be Russia's ELITE fighting forces. The VDV were pretty much wiped out trying to take the Kyiv airfield when they weren't reinforced in time, and the Spetznaz continue to operate, despite suffering heavy losses. Russia could NOT send conscripts into the warzone, as it's their own policy to not do this unless war is declared. Now they're drafting people under the auspice of ""volunteers"". Those will be conscripts. 

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here. While I take your points, and it's an interesting angle, Russia is fucked no matter which way you look at it. The economy is projected to shrink by at least 10%, they no longer have access to swathes of western supplies, and are about to lose their main economic lifeline within the next 5 years.

By those measures, it's impossible for Russia to ""win"" the war regardless of what happens. But those aren't the measures of success Putin apparently prioritized. Saying they wanted to take the capital and regime change was never supposed to work. Even if they dominated the city on the first attempt, they'd never hold it, and any installed government would never last. It's a nonsensical goal and any major world leader would understand that. It only makes sense as a distraction from what Russia actually wants to take which is the Donbas, oil, water, and coastline. If they get those things (which they probably will), Putin gets the victory he aimed for. The stock market will recover, and Putin and the government will profit on the recovery. The government is ready to nationalize plenty of assets to keep things from spiraling. Yes, NATO is stronger but duh that's going to happen. Russia will get a better foothold in their western flank which is their greatest geographical weakness. It also gets to bolster relations with China and others. 

And for the record, Russia did send very young inexperienced soldiers and old equipment to begin the invasion. It's the same strategy they used in Chechnya. Their play in Ukraine has always been to take what they want and destroy everything else.

6077,[],False,,poop_scallions,,,,,,"Obama wanted to use force and remove chemical weapons from Syria.

Congress didnt want to use force (neither did the US people). But the chemical weapons were removed.

&gt; On August 29, the British Parliament voted against Prime Minister David Cameron’s motion condemning Assad for the attack, the first step for British participation in military intervention. Weighing heavily on that vote was the still fresh memory of the consequences of British involvement in the Iraq war.
&gt; 
&gt; Faced with the loss of his closest ally, Obama made two announcements two days later. First was his decision to “take military action against Syrian regime targets.” The second was more consequential. He also decided to “seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress.”
&gt; 
&gt; At the time, Obama sounded confident that he would be able to convince Congress on the appropriateness of military action, despite his awareness of the public’s weariness with war after Iraq and Afghanistan.
&gt; 
&gt; After just one week, it had become clear that Congress would not back Obama’s request to use military force in Syria. Public opinion polls also opposed U.S intervention, and Obama was running into the same brick wall that a Republican Congress imposed on any proposals emanating from the White House. On September 8, five Republican Senators announced their opposition and a sixth, Lindsey Graham, said “It'd be great if the Russians could convince Assad to turn over his chemical weapons to the international community. That'd be a terrific outcome.”
&gt; 
&gt; Faced with a near certain defeat in Congress, Obama’s room to maneuver was limited. In what has been portrayed as an off-the-cuff remark, Secretary of State John Kerry opened up a potential avenue to achieve the same outcome as a military strike of eliminating the chemical weapons that Assad could use on his own people. In response to a reporter’s question on September 9, Kerry said Assad could avert military action by the U.S. if he would “turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.” The Russians moved quickly to propose just such an outcome. Obama responded tentatively, holding out the use of military action if such a plan was merely cause for delay.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day, Obama asked Congress to postpone a vote to allow for diplomacy to play out the diplomacy set in motion by Kerry’s remarks.
&gt; 
&gt; After an intense, accelerated negotiations, Kerry and his Russian counterpart announced on September 14 the framework of an agreement that would start a process to remove the chemical weapons in Syria under the supervision of the international community.
&gt; 
&gt; Less than a year later, on June 23, 2014, the UN certified that the last of Syria’s chemical weapons had been removed. That included over 1300 metric tons at over 45 different sites in Syria. The size alone of that stockpile makes it hard to conceive that military intervention would have had the same outcome.

6216,[],False,,Grimmblut,,,,,,"Ok, I'm gonna say it: I'm not 100% convinced that this was a penetrating hit.

1. The weapon that was used is a RPO-A Shmel, that is equiped with a thermobaric warhead, that has - apart from it's sheer explosive force - no AP capabilities. It is designed to be used against infantry and lightly armored vehicles. As you know, the term ""lightly armored vehicle"" is a very broad term, but for the RPO-A Shmel I rather see a Humvee as a fitting target than a BMP-3 with up to 35mm alluminium and steel armor.   
2. The rocket hits the top of the BMP. You can see a huge explosion, as one would expect from a thermobaric weapon, but that explosion seems to dissipate in a huge ball of smoke **above** the BMP. What is very telling is that there seems to be no smoke coming out from any openings at the front, the back, the sides or from below the BMP. If it would have been a penetrating hit, the enormous pressure of the explosion could have ripped open even previously closed and sealed hatches. Nothing of the sort is to be seen here.
3. Theres no cook off. The BMP-3 (assuming that's the model we see) is (according the Wikipedia) ""one of the most heavily armed infantry combat vehicles in service"", packed with ammo for the 100mm cannon, 30mm autocannon, three 7.92mm MG, and last but not least 8 ATGMs. I mean it's possible that, even in case of a penetrating hit, none of that ammo ""cooks off"", but it's not very likely. 
4. The cut-off of the video before we can get a clear picture of the damage that was caused. I'm sorry to say this, but there's a certain consistency with videos that cut-off right after the impact for which it then turnes out that the hit was not as devastating as claimed in the video, while there are other videos that go on for almost a minute or even longer when a penetrating hit has been achieved and we get to see the cook off for its full duration.

I think there's a good chance that the BMP was seriously damaged by that hit, but not necessarily knocked out. Maybe the crew abandoned it because of the hit, maybe it was destroyed by other means, but as I initially said, I'm not 100% convinced the BMP was knocked out by that hit.",bd25d010832966f75730c7529a039d26c60affb7,True,False,,,,,0,1649444296,,0,{},i3xrbpk,False,t3_tz5ljh,False,True,t3_tz5ljh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/tz5ljh/azov_fighter_manages_to_sneak_up_and_destroy_a/i3xrbpk/,1649444309,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649415496.0,[],text,t2_zi30w,False,False,

The entire thing was a massive cluster fuck. It was by a ridiculous margin the most unpopular war in American history, making Iraq and Afghanistan look like WW2 in war support. And on top of that that the war is the golden child for everyone who is anti US, and its like an endless back and forth of shit slinging.





No other American conflict gets downplayed as hard by pro American sources or overblown by anti American sources. For example the 800k dead Cambodians number. The population of Cambodia was 7 million +-500k throughout the war. The US did not kill 1 out of every 9 Cambodians while almost exclusively hitting the sparsely populated east, that's ridiculous. On the other hand, it's naive to believe that there weren't more atrocities like Mai Lai that aren't public knowledge (maybe not as big, but the same level of savagery on a smaller scale).




As for hundreds of thousands of enemy 'combatants' being in truth civilians. That's entirely possible and almost certainly true to an extent. However you also have to take into account 'civilians' that were active collaborators with NVA and VC forces (sheltering, feeding, hiding their weapons, etc).

That's just an optimal control for most ballistic rockets, look at Space X's multi-use ones. They function even when they're on the leading edge of the rocket, when they're landing.

What you're trying to say here makes no sense from a physics perspective. Regardless of the direction (or angle, unless it is *exactly* vertical) that an object falls out of the sky, if that object separates into two objects (or several, i.e. main rocket and released munitions), the object with the higher drag will land closer to its point of origin because its horizontal velocity is reduced more than that of the other object.

For what you're saying to be true, the body of the rocket would have to have intentionally steered itself farther (horizontally) farther than the munitions *after* they were detached. Diagram: https://ibb.co/gdVFc0t

Around 200ish yards and out it becomes easier to hear the “crack” a passing bullet makes. That’s because there’s enough time between the gunshot and the bullet traveling past the target. At 25 yards for example, you won’t hear the “crack” of the bullet over the actual report of the firearm because the two are too close to each other. However if you were taking rounds at 400 yards, you would audibly hear the rounds crack over your head before you actually heard the gunshots. Obviously this is because “sound” is traveling through a medium, thus takes longer to travel 400 yards as opposed to a bullet; so at 400 yards the bullet is typically going be almost 2 or more seconds (depending on the type of bullet, velocity, grain, etc) faster than the sound of the gun itself. So in straight numerical terms: the speed of sound is around 1,125 feet per second. A standard 5.56 round of 55 grains (projectile weight) coming from a standard AR-15 barrel of 16 inches is usually going around 2,900-3,100 feet per second. Therefore that particular bullet is traveling well over twice as fast as the sound it made while being fired.

One place you can really see this in action was with ww2 fighter pilots.

Germany had aces with hundreds of kills. It wasn't that they were that much better, it was that they flew until they died. The Allied aces came nowhere close. Not that they were bad, but once they had proven success in the air they were rotated out to help train new pilots.

The result is that while Germany and Japan probably had the best pilots, it was only a small number of them among many more inexperienced pilots.

2 days ago there was talk on social media and UA twitter that UA is going for a double envelopment of Russian troops in and around Kherson. Apparently a large contingent of forces from Kherson moved north east and were cut off at Osokorivka and pushed back as well as being cut off from Velyka and Dudchany basically encircled.

The forces in Kherson are mostly stationed in the Airfield and two villages (Bilozerka and Chornobaivka) coming into Kherson. Russians never had the manpower to secure Kherson city it self.

If this is true: [https://twitter.com/CanadianUkrain1](https://twitter.com/CanadianUkrain1) then UA is on the verge of taking Kherson. We know they are pushing from the north and east now it seems from west as well. This would put UA to some 10km away from Kherson centre.

Tanks are huge imposing beasts. The psychological effect alone of even a single one appearing at the horizon or around a street corner shakes you to the core. The earth rumbles as they get closer and your ears ring from them even firing in the distance. There's a reason these guys are getting panicked the moment the Ukrainian tank shows up.

Modern tanks, even the most abysmal ex-Soviet hunk of Siberian steel currently rolling about, would have been the dream of every general prior to WW1: They are, at the same time, artillery, field artillery and heavy cavalry, but they are faster than light cavalry. They are steel wagons that can dish out an enormous amount of punishment in a very short time. They *can* operate in the mud, they can operate in steep terrain and dense woods, in urban and less urban environments - if you know how to use them, if crew and command are trained well, if they are suited to the task and environment.

I mean, of course they need infantry support. You can't do anything meaningful on any battlefield without sending in foot soldiers at some point, but they can not do everything on their own. Combined arms these days needs infantry, MBTs, IFVs, artillery, drones and other air power. Take any of these away and your options are drastically limited. Tanks provide mobility and firepower that you're not getting with anything else. That famous Baykatar drone? It carries four bombs. A T-72 carries 45 rounds of AP and HE ammunition - and you can get at least five to ten of them for the price of one of these Turkish drones.

Both have their purposes and both have their place on the battlefield.

Hahhahahahahahahahahahahaha oh man that was hella funny.

&gt; I’ll need to refresh my memory on how Canadian system evolved from British/French colonies to today. However, Canada doesn’t have history of centuries of Russification equivalent at the hands of British or French. 

You might want to brush up on your Canadian history then. The Durham report specifically stated:

&gt; I entertain no doubts as to the national character which must be given to Lower Canada [Québec]; it must be that of the British Empire; that of the majority of the population of British America; that of the great race which must, in the lapse of no long period of time, be predominant over the whole North American Continent. Without effecting the change so rapidly or so roughly as to shock the feelings and trample on the welfare of the existing generation, it must henceforth be the first and steady purpose of the British Government to establish an English population, with English laws and language, in this Province, and to trust its government to none but a decidedly English Legislature.

The policies implemented thereafter resulted in the Diaspora of over a million french speakers. Mainly to New England, where they eventually fully assimilated anyway (apart from some very small pockets). And were mostly met with disdain, and the KKK.

&gt; If Quebec were to gain independence, do you think they’ll maintain current commitment to bi-lingualism? 

Quebec isn't bilingual.

Now, Erdogan says, ‘I staged this coup. It is now time to construct its legal basis.’

So, correct me if I'm wrong here: Erdogan says some Erdogan crap (I'm not a fan, to heck with him). Opposition person then paraphrases or interprets that in an ...I guess anti-Erdogan political way? And you take this as evidence that the E made a false flag coup happen?

Russia DID NOT send in conscripts or old kit from the beginning. Russia sent in the Spetznaz, the VDV and their contracted soldiers. These are professional men, who were sorely let down by a Ukraine that has been trained by NATO for the last 8yrs to defeat exactly this kind of attack. Russian equipment is just not as good as they'd made out. Yes they have some advanced next-gen kit, but it's either in tiny numbers, or not even ready yet. 

Putin has spent decades posturing to the West that his army is strong, professional, and second only to the United States. This war has shown what a lie that was; logistics are a shit-show, training is woeful, and their equipment is not only outdated, it appears to be far inferior to the West in almost every regard. 

Russia did not want the entire country. Russia stated at the start of the conflict that it's aim was to remove Zelensky and the ""fascists"" in power. This involved a quick campaign, with the idea that Ukraine would collapse and the drive into Kyiv would be met with cheers from the populace. This did NOT happen. As Russian losses continued to mount, the dire logistical situation was laid bare. Russia even resorted to using civilian vehicles to supply it's troops, and then ended up in full retreat from their initial advance on Kyiv. 

Russia has since re-postured to stating that the Donbass region was the goal all along. This is a hilarious lie that anyone can see through. Russian divisions have been soundly defeated, demoralised, and smashed at nearly every juncture. The siege of Mariupol alone has cost them thousands of men to secure a city which is essentially rubble by now.

TL;DR Russia may indeed win the battle, but the war is well and truly lost:

- Finland is now petitioning for NATO membership, and I imagine Sweden won't be far behind. Russian threats to them will fall on deaf ears because Putin has shown just how weak the Russian armed forces are. 
- Years of Russian attempts to undermine NATO have been reversed, especially with German re-armament
- The West is now more united than in most people's living memory
- The Russian economy is in tatters
- Russia has been shown to the world to be weak and ineffective. This will have serious negative impacts on both future arms sales, and perhaps future conflicts with bordering nations
- Thousands of Russians are dead, with hundreds of irreplaceable weapons-systems and transports either captured, damaged or destroyed

Make no mistake, this war is a disaster for Putin.

I really don't want the is to seem like a callous or disingenuous question but how on earth can there be rules of war?

Where is the line with these things? If I were in Putins situation I would do anything possible to win including targeting civilian buildings to bomb them into submission. All of this is so horrible I just don't understand the position that some abhorrent actions are seen as ok and not others.

Between 2017 and 2020, trainers and specialists helped instruct the Ukranian JFO divisions. That's the case with the flag they found and claimed was proof they killed an American.

Active US and NATO personel are simply not near the fighting. Mariupol was not enveloped until March 3rd. Any trainers still in the area would have ample time and orders to leave. Their practical value inside the city would have been minimal. 

Meanwhile, their presence could spark war. 

The ""NATO personel"" at the facility in the west is also wildly overstated. There are EX-NATO forces fighting in Ukraine. I have yet to see a single shred of credible evidence of a single active NATO personel. 

Side note. The word Mercenary is incorrect. It implies members of a PMC who are fighting exclusively for pay.
