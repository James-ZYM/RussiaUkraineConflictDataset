[],False,,KnifeEdge,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_3saiv,False,False,"&gt;First of all, hand on your heart. Have you ever been in Central Europe, and if the answer is yes, have you been in the cities and paid a tiny little bit of attention to the architecture? Your view of Central Europe sounds like you got it from tales of pre-industrial times. We had massive, densely populated areas since the 1870s. And about the same time it stopped being mostly farm land. I'd argue there is more farm land in Ukraine today than there has been in my country during WW2. We also had a train and highway infrastructure better than the US central states have now.  


Well I don't know where you live man, so it's kind of hard to respond to that.

&amp;#x200B;

There's simply no country in Europe that's less developed now than it was in WW2

&amp;#x200B;

So any fight now is going to comparatively be worse than it was in WW2 precision weapons or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There's no country in Europe of any appreciable size that has a smaller population than it did during WW2, and last I checked, Europe isn't any bigger now than in the 40s so density by definition is higher now.

&amp;#x200B;

Infrastructure now is also better than it was in WW2 which makes that infrastructure far more important to deploying troops and supplies now where it exists. Remember than containerization really only happened in the 60s which had trickle down effects in terms of roads and city planning. If a war breaks out in a random place in africa you're going to see the front move across the map in a more or less even front across the landscape. But in a highly urbanized/developed battleground you're going to see it move across the major road networks/railways because it's simply easier to push across a road than open fields.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I mean it is kinda off topic, but I find it offensive to read the massive destruction of civil areas in WW2 denied by someone who probably has never been here, while I literally still get bomb warnings in 80 years later, living in a city that already excited in this shape in the 1940s, in a house built in the 1890s, right next to houses built in the 1950s because shit happened and bombs fell down here.

I have no idea how you got from what I said that I'm denying there's massive destruction to civil areas. I'm saying there's less of them during WW2 and more of them now in the same parts of Europe. Not exactly a controversial claim. How many multi story residential concrete structures were there in Europe in WW2 ? Just because cities existed in WW2 doesn't mean that they're the same size/scale/breadth as they are now.

&gt;I don't think 10 + 3 are 20, and in my textbook 13/7 is closer to 2 than to 3, thus closer to 50% than 30%. It's a bit ironic that you blame other people not being good at math in another comment.

you're shitting me right ? 10k russians, 3k ukrainian soldiers, 7k civilians = 20k deaths

7000 civilians out of a total of 20000 deaths, 35% of total deaths are civilians

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Never ever did I call the US or Israel the good guys. Far from it. I find civilian casualties in the Arabic world just as bad as in Ukraine. I'm feeling slightly more involved in the Ukraine war because it's in driving distance from my home and we had refugees coming here from the first days. I think that's understandable. But boy have I been angry with the US in their wars before.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't say you did either. I'm clarifying my point I'm trying to make in general on my original post. 

If you're consistent that's fine. My point is there's a whole lot of ""double-standards"" in the general media landscape and there's very little context in terms of these numbers. What does 7000 civilian deaths even mean ? 7000 civilian deaths in all of WW2 is a meaningless number, but 7000 civilian deaths in a bar fight is massive. Perspective/comparison matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not 0% but lower than 90%, and I'd argue it should be lower than 50% or else it is targeting civilians under an excuse of military targets.

Yeah 90% is nuts, I put that there because if you look at conflicts in the 20th &amp; 21st century, it ranges from 30% to 90% of total deaths in war are civilians and provided my source. That doesn't mean I think it's OK, it is what it is. I don't know how a ""correct"" number could be ascertained as it really depends on the situation but 50% to me still probably ""feels"" like a number on the high side. I'd argue that it's a bit presumptuous to somehow think that a bigger number automatically means deliberately targetting civilians as there's numerous ways civilians could end up in the crossfire without it being deliberate. 

There's literally videos of AT teams on rooftops of a regular house shooting at russian tanks. If the tank returns fire and the house goes down, that could be what like 2 or 3 infantry dead but there could have been a family of 7 in that house. Was that a ""good"" shoot ? 

&amp;#x200B;

Again this comes down to the complexities of fighting in a highly modern urbanized battleground. Both sides are unfortunately capable of putting civilians in the line of fire in this way. Big tall civilian multi-storey buildings are perfect platforms for anti tank teams as it makes the job of targetting armor from above laughably easy. The problem with this is as soon as you fire the first shot, the other side is just going to demolish that building with artillery or a bomb to take you out. Neither side is going to risk infantry to clear that building floor by floor either to attack it OR when setting up their ambush position in the first place. If there were 2 or 3 families out of the hundred units still there, that's 2 or 3 military combatants and like 20 civilians. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like ... do you think a Ukrainian AT team that spots an platoon of tanks is going to bother checking every unit on every floor of an apartment before setting up to take out a few juicy targets ? It's just not gonna happen. Would they knowingly do it ? Unknowingly ? How much effort should they expend to try to evacuate the building ?

Russia pulls out of the North, Ukraine concentrates its forces in the east, then Russia could re-attack from the North to potentially encircle the Ukrainian regulars. Ukraine can not concentrate all of its heavy combat units in the east, because literally 3/4 of their border is Russian-held or Russian-allied, with substantial Russian assets on hand.

Ukraine has to defend itself everywhere. Russia does not have to distribute defensive forces everywhere, because Ukraine is unlikely to advance into Belarus or Russia with ground forces. If they can move fast enough (pulling back to the Russian/Belarus rail network permits them to move extremely fast) means they can probably concentrate forces for an attack faster than Ukraine can concentrate for a defense.  A few feints by the Russians with rail logistics could also end up with Ukraine units scattered.

&amp;#x200B;

We'd never hear about it, not until years after the war at least, but a couple of Ukraine special ops units roaming Russia and messing with railroad tracks would be extremely disruptive to the Russian effort. they wouldn't even need explosives or guns, just some power tools, and long pry bars.  


I realize that with satellite and electronic intelligence assets, we should have a handle on what is available to the Russians, but the Russians know that. lying to satellite surveillance is something that the Soviet Union used to be good at, so there is no reason to doubt that they can do it now.

First of all, hand on your heart. Have you ever been in Central Europe, and if the answer is yes, have you been in the cities and paid a tiny little bit of attention to the architecture? Your view of Central Europe sounds like you got it from tales of pre-industrial times. We had massive, densely populated areas since the 1870s. And about the same time it stopped being mostly farm land. I'd argue there is more farm land in Ukraine today than there has been in my country during WW2. We also had a train and highway infrastructure better than the US central states have now. 

I mean it is kinda off topic, but I find it offensive to read the massive destruction of civil areas in WW2 denied by someone who probably has never been here, while I literally still get bomb warnings in 80 years later, living in a city that already excited in this shape in the 1940s, in a house built in the 1890s, right next to houses built in the 1950s because shit happened and bombs fell down here.

&gt; 7000 civies (the conservative ""worst case"") 

&gt; 10,000 Russians soldiers (average)

&gt; ​3,000 Ukrainian soldiers

&gt; ​7000/20,000 is roughly 30%, does it really matter whether it's 30% or 35% when the error bars are massive ?

I don't think 10 + 3 are 20, and in my textbook 13/7 is closer to 2 than to 3, thus closer to 50% than 30%. It's a bit ironic that you blame other people not being good at math in another comment. 

&gt; One shouldn't condemn Ukrainian civilian casualties as evil simply because ""we don't like russia"" but justify afghan/iraqi/Palestinian deaths somehow because ""we're the good guys"".

Never ever did I call the US or Israel the good guys. Far from it. I find civilian casualties in the Arabic world just as bad as in Ukraine. I'm feeling slightly more involved in the Ukraine war because it's in driving distance from my home and we had refugees coming here from the first days. I think that's understandable. But boy have I been angry with the US in their wars before.

&gt; You can't operate in war if your ""acceptable risk of civilian collateral damage"" is 0 %. It just doesn't work that way.

Not 0% but lower than 90%, and I'd argue it should be lower than 50% or else it *is* targeting civilians under an excuse of military targets.",ff414a4c35b9546663ef4933379de094790521b3,True,False,,,,,0,1649510738,,0,{},i415fay,False,t3_tzkevl,False,True,t1_i4117bk,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tzkevl/civilian_deaths_in_perspective/i415fay/,1649510750,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649481938.0,

Especially since a bus full of kids doesn't usually drive into military areas or your own home country - so it shouldn't count as self defense either. At the very least I expect such mistakes admitted asap. If civilians aren't the target then the aggressor should immediately admit their mistake and not try to justify it. That's spitting on the graves of dead children.

It depends on how that intel came about, I don't think it's possible to have perfect information and I do agree that bad intel or intel of questionable authenticity should not be acted upon (or further investigation should be done) but I wouldn't go so far as to say anytime a schoolbus full of kids gets bombed, its always a case of negligent action. That's a bit too hand wavy and dismissing the nuances which come with operating in the real world. 

&amp;#x200B;

If a school bus is headed straight for an FOB or something and there was good REAL intel that a suicide bombing event was to take place/planned against that specific target, .... what are you supposed to do just sit there and wait ? What if it's the driver that's the suicide bomber and kids are fked either way ? There's just simply no way to be 100% accurate on anything. 

&gt;World War 2 was certainly not fought only in farmland. You're welcome to visit my country and take a look at the architecture in every big city, where you can see how rows of colonial style houses have post war style houses built in the 50s-60s inbetween like a wild patchwork, because the houses that originally stood there were bombed in the war. If you visit any museum or high school you may also see a gallery of war photographs showing the ruined cities. If you build a house here in the cities, chances are you will find WW2 bombs in the ground that didn't detonate yet. I was evacuated three times in the last five years because WW2 bombs were found in my neighborhood.

my point is, WW2 is not anything like modern warfare (not specifically that it was fought only on farmland)

&amp;#x200B;

* there was no such thing as precision munitions, area bombardment was much more intense and prevalent in WW2 than now
* Europe was simply not as developed then as it is now (even Ukraine), hence taking down a random civilian building, even if it was packed with civilians, isn't going to lead to the same level of casualties as today when a multi level residential building could have hundreds of people in it
* furthermore population densities have gone up in the past 80 years
* we've developed more land in the past 80 year, so while it's conceivable that in WW2 you can push across large swathes of land without encountering a civilian (depending on the theater) you can't really expect the same thing now in Europe

&gt;You didn't use the averages you said you would use. It would actually work in your favor if you did. But 7000 also aren't 33% of 13000, it's more than 50%. This scope of miscalculation is scetchy as fuck.

That's kind of the point, if a couple thousand either way doesn't really change the result of the calculation, then the rhetoric that there's indiscriminate killing of civilians doesn't really hold up, unless we're saying that basically in ALL wars there's indiscriminate killing of civilians. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also ... where am I wrong ? 

&amp;#x200B;

7000  civies (the conservative ""worst case"")  


10,000 Russians soldiers (average)

&amp;#x200B;

3,000 Ukrainian soldiers

&amp;#x200B;

7000/20,000 is roughly 30%, does it really matter whether it's 30% or 35% when the error bars are massive ?

&amp;#x200B;

If there's truly indiscriminate killing of civilians or purposeful targeting of civilians, wouldn't you expect a much higher proportion of civilian deaths than the wars in say Afghanistan/Iraq where coalition forces tried decently hard at avoiding collateral damage ?

Especially when it's probably a lot easier to kill hundreds of civilians deliberately with one bomb on a residential tower in Ukraine than it is in Afghanistan where there's what like 100 people in a big ass village.

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers don't fit the narrative. 

&amp;#x200B;

There will always be the handful of psychopath soldiers who commit atrocities in war, but if the message is from top down the entire Russian Army is committing genocide, I'd expect a helluva lot more civilian deaths than 7000.

&gt;Which constitutes a war crime used on civilian areas. I would hardly call that good.  
  


What constitutes a war crime exactly ?

* artillery
   * can't really NOT have artillery in war
   * all targets are in ""civilian"" areas, you have antitank teams firing at tanks from the roofs of houses .... like .... what are you supposed to do if you were being shot at ?
* non-precision bombing
   * it's not really used anymore, even dumb bombs are pretty accurate now compared to what was done in WW2 (which was my main point)
* bad target/intel precision bombing
   * yeah that sucks, I'm not sure how this constitutes a war crime though, it's unfortunate but we're going down the ""it's a bad shoot"" ... but how bad of a shoot is it ? are we talking marginal call or CLEARLY bad ? 

&gt;And I also don't really care if you think 90% civilian casualties would still be normal. It's to be avoided at all cost and if it was normal before, we need to fix those norms asap.  


It's not really I think it's normal or not. I'm saying simply, put things in perspective by comparing against previous cases. It's ok if you think any cases of civilians being killed is bad or if you think it can be justified. I'm saying merely be consistent in one's viewpoints and analysis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like if you think Ukrainian civilian deaths in the proportion that we're seeing is bad, then the civilian deaths in Afghanistan/Iraq/Gaza/etc. are bad on the same scale assuming there is NOT deliberate targeting of civilians on a mass scale. One shouldn't condemn Ukrainian civilian casualties as evil simply because ""we don't like russia"" but justify afghan/iraqi/Palestinian deaths somehow because ""we're the good guys"".

&amp;#x200B;

I do think that civilian deaths in war are tragic and combatants should do what they can to prevent them ... but there's a limit. You can't operate in war if your ""acceptable risk of civilian collateral damage"" is 0 %. It just doesn't work that way. Hell, it probably isn't 0% for Ukraine's own armed forces. There are definitely some civilian deaths which were friendly fire from the defense forces and as tragic as those deaths are, there's probably not a single person in the world that would characterize those deaths as a war crime.",90ef6a5f8fc69600a66870ec39c7185006d338a4,True,False,,,,,0,1649508545,,0,{},i4117bk,True,t3_tzkevl,False,True,t1_i40sctp,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tzkevl/civilian_deaths_in_perspective/i4117bk/,1649508558,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649479745.0,

&gt; A soldier gunning down a single farmer in cold blood is far worse than fog of war/bad intelligence leading to a school bus full of kids getting precision bombed because military intelligence legitimately (somehow) thought it was full of suicide bombers.

I disagree. Intel that's so bad that mistakes like this could happen should not be acted upon. Especially since a bus full of kids doesn't usually drive into military areas or your own home country - so it shouldn't count as self defense either. At the very least I expect such mistakes admitted asap. If civilians aren't the target then the aggressor should immediately admit their mistake and not try to justify it. That's spitting on the graves of dead children. 

&gt; you can't really compare world war 2 with modern warfare because of the dissimilarities in technology for both communications and precision weapons, and fighting in cities with very high population densities with fighting in effectively farmland which is very low in population density

World War 2 was certainly not fought only in farmland. You're welcome to visit my country and take a look at the architecture in *every* big city, where you can see how rows of colonial style houses have post war style houses built in the 50s-60s inbetween like a wild patchwork, because the houses that originally stood there were bombed in the war. If you visit any museum or high school you may also see a gallery of war photographs showing the ruined cities. If you build a house here in the cities, chances are you will find WW2 bombs in the ground that didn't detonate yet. I was evacuated three times in the last five years because WW2 bombs were found in my neighborhood.

&gt; So in total we probably have something like 13,000 combatants killed and ~7,000 civilians for a civilian fatal casualty % of something like 33%.

You didn't use the averages you said you would use. It would actually work in your favor if you did. But 7000 also aren't 33% of 13000, it's more than 50%. This scope of miscalculation is scetchy as fuck. 

&gt; Most civilian casualties that are ""good"" (as in justified) casualties are the result of area bombardment (artillery, non-precision bombing, bad target precision bombing) which, in a population dense European country/city are going to naturally be worse

Which constitutes a war crime used on civilian areas. I would hardly call that good.

But watching a video about the *used* car market in Moscow, the owner of the shop basically indicated the same thing. Just before the war, there was an uptick in used car prices of about 30%.

Russians can't buy hard currency with roubles, they're only allowed to sell (and anyone who has it is forced to sell it bit by bit, because they need to pay bills, which in Russia they can only do with roubles.)

The official FOREX rate is 1:80. The black market rate is anywhere between 1:120 and 1:150, highly volatile because there's extremely low trade volume, less than 1% of pre-war trade volume (so not enough to set a consistent price, it's really about who's buying and selling at a given time.)

Even beyond that, there are signs of manipulation, such as Russia slowly draining its remaining reserves to prop up the rouble and prevent panic. Given the very low trade volumes (and a ban on domestic selling), they don't need to spend a huge amount to prop it up and make it appear like its worth more than it is. But it's a meaningless psychological exercise, precisely because almost nobody is trading it, so a good exchange rate can't be materialized for a meaningful amount of actual hard currency for Russia.

It's the same myth as saying outer space is super cold. Except in reality, astronauts would actually overheat from their own body heat without cooling.

3) Enraged more Ukrainians to resist harder

Similarly to Russia now, Germany completely miscalculated its WW1 plans. About forty years before it had beaten France at war and they thought it could easily be repeated. Instead the German-French frontline turned into a meat grinder for years, so that even a hundred years later hearing ""Verdun"" gives any halfway educated German a chill.

The humiliation of things not working like planned though, Germany brought on itself. Same goes for the desertions at the end of war. Thus the blame was not just put on the other countries, but also within. The Dolchstoßlegende was born - a conspiracy theory about inside forces (jews or communists or political opponents) having given up a war they could have won.

The post war narrative was provided by the very people who were responsible or in high positions during the war. The emperor was dethroned, but the war ministers, advisors, generals stayed.

The loss of war, the high reparations, the financial crisis, for everything they had scapegoats to blame. Scapegoat narratives - conspiracy theories used as propaganda just the way they are today - do a good job at fueling extremist views and dehumanizing the ""other""

After WW2 a lot things were corrected: the people with the highest military ranks or who were directly involved in the horrors of war Germany were *not* kept in power. The post war narrative was provided by the allies, not some bitter generals who didn't want to accept a loss. The allies actively worked on re-integrating Germany (partially for selfish reasons but honestly we don't mind) which meant the civilian survivors didn't feel shunned. Thankfully the proposal of ending our industry and economy for decades to come was not accepted, that could have tilted the mood to hostility again. 

So if we take Germany as an example, one of the most important steps is to remove a bunch of people from the Russian power structure - otherwise they *will* work against peace efforts. And get a hold of the propaganda mechanisms. Destroy them, control them, whatever. And then help rebuild and reintegrate. 

For as long as the war goes and Putin is in power I'm  much for sanctions. If the situation changes, be it from inside (possibly not realistic) or from the outside, we might have to quickly change course of action to avoid the mistakes done in Germany.

Treating Russia with silk gloves while Putin and the old propaganda apparatus were in place was probably stupid. It's important that, if we want long term peace, the propaganda machine in stopped. Even just removing Putin won't be enough. The structure needs to be fixed.
