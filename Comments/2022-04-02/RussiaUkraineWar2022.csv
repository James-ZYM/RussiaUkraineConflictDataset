As for ""Mark of Cain"". Listen to how Col. Tim Collins used it in his speech to his troops just before they went into Iraq in 2003.

She didn't blow them up with an NLAW, or put on a ghillie suit and stalk them with a Dragunov.  They're just as dead as they would have been  in either situation, but there's a coldness involved in the preparation and choice of means that I think deserves the description. Those guys probably took a long time dying in agony and we all celebrate her for it (including me, initially).

I'm saying look who we become in war, look what we do. 
We need to keep some perspective, or we all lose our Humanity. Note I include myself in that number. I want to see Putin out of Ukraine (all of it!) and if I was 15 or maybe 20 yrs younger, I'd be there. But I'm not going to forget that many of those Orc's are poorly led, poorly supplied,  didn't want to be there, that they are humans too.

Being on the street is about showing yourself. Making sure others afraid to go the streets can see some already doing it, so they might as well join. A protest either gets such widespread support among the population that it becomes a risk or it dies down.

That's not true, every war has one. And while don't exactly know the initial plan, we can still make an educated guess.

First goal was most probably capturing Kyiv and installing a puppet government there, in order to change its pro-Western politics. Second was expanding controlled areas in the east and south of Ukraine, with the goal of reducing Ukrainian geographical and economical power.

The very short version is that Ukraine has always been a neutral territory between Russia and the West/NATO, a buffer zone of sorts. In addition to that, being a part of former USSR, Ukraine has always been pro Russian or highly influenced by Russia. Then that started to slowly change and Ukraine began leaning to the west. Russia didn't like that. USA did and used it to further undermine Russia by pumping Ukraine with weapons and using other methods to influence it.

Russia started demanding USA to stop influencing Ukraine and USA obviously played stupid. Ukraine started asking into NATO. Russia cannot have NATO military bases in Ukraine. Russia asked NATO to stop expanding to the east as they promised years prior. NATO played stupid. Here is a good article about the ""promise"" part.

The 2014 happened and Ukraine replaced Russia-friendly president with an unequivocally Western-facing government. Anti Russian movements began festering in Ukraine. Donbass, a historically pro Russian territory decided to separate from Ukraine because of this. Ukraine didn't like that and started shelling it. Russia used this conflict to justify invasion to ""protect Russian speaking population of Ukraine from  genocide"". The true reason for invasion is to make Ukraine weak again, so that Russia can strip it from Western effect and make it neutral, and by neutral Putin means influenced by Russia.

He is bombing entire cities into ruin.  Many people in Russia support the war, many people oppose it.  It benefits Putin if we have sympathy for those who oppose him inside Russia, as it allows him to escape the worst sanctions.

I have friends that are Russian.  These people I love and respect and would give my life to protect.  I appreciate everyone in Russia who is standing up to Putin and begging him to stop the bloodshed.  Nevertheless, their efforts are thus far fruitless and in vain.  The bloodshed continues.

The United States and ""the West"" have imposed many harsh economic sanctions targeted at the upper echelons of Russian government and society.  These sanctions are intended to limit Putin's ability to wage war without causing undue distress to the average Russian citizen.  Nevertheless, the sanctions thus far have failed to stop the war.  The bloodshed continues.

Now I'm sure that we can all agree that the sooner the suffering and bloodshed stops, the better.  All measures taken thus far have failed to stop the violence.  So additional measures will need to be taken.  Soon it will become increasingly difficult to stop the slaughter of civilians in Ukraine without first causing increasing hardships for the average citizen of Russia.  

I don't want my Russian friends to suffer, but this war must end.  How long will Putin's reign of terror continue once all your store shelves are empty?  How long after you lose your entire internet?  How long after you lose electricity?  Hopefully, it will not come to that, but we may be starting to creep in that direction.

I love my Russian friends, but the Free World can not afford for me to have sympathy for them again until this is all over.  We can call my sympathy a ""casualty of war"".

Tell your friends:
Passports and family photos will do nothing to convince an outsider of your right to exist, but what *will* help is something proving you risked your own freedom by rising up in opposition to your regime…and the best way to get that document is by being arrested.

My friends mum was extremely rational. But when she got cancer, she tried all the medical solutions.

Your experiences are of a conflict that’s extremely unlike the war that the Ukrainians are fighting; they may not always be applicable to their situation. There’s much less likelihood of suddenly and unexpectedly encountering enemies the way it was in Iraq because the Russians fight in large units and in uniform. This is more than likely just a small unit confirming that there’s no Russian straggler or wounded left behind, not some dedicated building clearance meant to dislodge entrenched defenders. Sending a platoon or a company in there and kicking in every single door is likely neither necessary nor a luxury which they can afford just to do it by the book.

&gt;The Kuril Islands are a chain of islands and known in Japan as the Northern Territories. The problem of the Kuril Islands dates back to World War II. The Kuril Islands were a territory of Japan until the fall of the Japanese Empire during the war.
The Soviet Union captured the islands in line with the demand of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference. The Japanese residents of the island were being expelled to Japan by the USSR until 1949. According to the claims of Japan, the islands must be returned to Japan and the decision of the Yalta Conference giving the islands to the USSR are void for Japan, since Japan was not involved in the Yalta Conference.
On the other hand, Russia argues that the islands should be legally returned to the USSR as a result of Japan's defeat in World War II. According to the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, two of four islands, or 6% of the disputed area, were returned to Japan.",2d0197184aeca32f4fd9dc53f9eba9fcd0a91e09,True,False,,,,,0,1648907086,,0,{},i33vc8e,False,t3_tu8yxm,False,True,t3_tu8yxm,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/tu8yxm/japan_to_again_designate_russianheld_isles_of/i33vc8e/,1648907099,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1648878286.0,,,,

This is mostly a place for jobless neckbeards that still live with their parents, and nerdy high school kids that don't have any friends.

Even if it were true that you're an incredibly talented soldier, I think all the military discipline would prevent you from getting mad enough to murder some random idiot on the internet. I also doubt that even the best SEALs have a 'secret network of spies across the USA'.

In my humble and most definitely no expert opinion, the only way this war will cease is if Putin is gone. There are only 2 ways for that to happen;

1. Internal coup ..... difficult (but not impossible) with his protection and paranoia. That will only happen if his subordinates become disillusioned, paranoid or fearful for their own life

2. The babushka ..... Russian mothers are the only people Russian leaders are afraid of. The only way the babushka will raise their voices is if plenty of Russian soldiers die.

766.0,[],False,,Angry_AGAIN,,,[],,,,text,t2_8f9ej,False,False,"Its part of the russian doctrine. Quantity and speed matters. 

The doctrine was build around a zerg rush towards east and then western germany, they had to move millions of people and 100.000 of vehicles thru a half of the continent to actually reach the frontline. And time is crucial because it was clear that germany can only delay the initial movement, this is why the german doctrine was build around defense and delaying operation until the rest of the world arrives for WWIII (Spain/French/GB/America)

So speed and time is key, there is no time to stop if one of the mediocre T tanks tracks break, because every hour standstill brings american Bombers/Aircraft's/Aircraft carriers closer to the Frontline. This is reflected by their support gear, the russian recovery vehicle are mostly based on BMP2/BTR Chassis, western recovery assets are based on MBT's.

And remember this is in a time when cluster ammo wasn't banned. The Panavia Tornado's main goal was to hunt armor collums we saw in Ukraine and drop clusterbombs on them while german artillery shells them. 

So, overall, leaving such gear behind isnt uncommon but its not monocausal. A Track could be replaced even on shitty tanks, but in the middle of nowhere with enemies everywhere and an astonishing lack of support and coordination what should they do? Waiting there until a support unit arrives could be a death sentence. And those russians know how fucked they are atm, so why risk your life and the life's of a bunch of logistic guys to recover an asset that nobody gave a fuck about in the first place(Sending it out without propper support).

Remarkable is that those things are looking mostly intact. Normally, such an asset would be blown up by its crew. Its possible that the Crew destroyed the electronics or sabotaged the thing in other ways, but leaving it in such pristine conditions is something new during a war.",d3cd8dde218b39e10ecff3780a32cf4e56e25253,True,False,,,,,0,1648889838,,0,{},i337cox,False,t3_ttvlqu,False,True,t1_i31emh3,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ttvlqu/the_ukrainian_forces_captured_another_very_potent/i337cox/,1648889853,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1648861038.0,,,,

I mean, I can't believe I have to try to explain this even further to you... But ok... I'll try! 

Let's say the Nazi army, or Putin's army, or ISIS, or someone of that horrific ilk, invades your neighborhood and does horrific unspeakable things... including things to your family (and pets) right in front of you. 

And then some clueless douche on the Internet responds with ""Oh my, how sweet!"" in response to seeing what one of those invading soldiers looted from your country? 

------------------------------

So that's exactly what you are doing here on this particular subreddit. 

And your response to my shock at your tone deafness is to double down and just try to argue how right you are, and try to gaslight us into assuming that the soldier who looted that toy is a good person, because he wanted to bring a toy back home? 

------------------------------

Also on that last note... 

I can ABSOLUTELY assure you: even the most dangerous and vile of psychopaths of history have been readily known to present great gifts to family, and those they try to court. 

In fact, psychos and other low empathy disorders (such as Malignant Narcissists) often do so in an EXCESSIVE fashion, basically as a misguided broken attempt to buy other people's love, which in psychology is known as: 

""Love Bombing"". 

A quite fitting term I would say, given the war situation! 

------------------------------

But yes, in short... at the very least: 

I would say your ""Oh, my, how sweet!"" outburst... 

is so (SO) utterly misplaced given the suffering of the Ukraine people at the hands of this military. 

I don't get why you want to let yourself be so easily tricked and fooled when a psycho tries to buy your love?

Because I have to say, in this case, all it took was a photo of a looted toy, to purchase your misguided love, and have you make such a misguided statement. 

Not to mention how you're totally assuming that the toy was stolen for a child back home (when in fact a lot of grown men enjoy playing with remote controlled cars!). 

------------------------

All in all... 

That's quite a cheap price you are selling yourself out for, to go onto a Ukraine-plight focused sight and say that the soldier who stole that must absolutely be a good person, and utter your cringe ""How sweet!"" exclamations. 

Is that what you want for yourself? 

Call me crazy, but instead, perhaps... you should at least consider refocusing your energies into giving your love and empathy to the people of Ukraine instead?

They are far more deserving of it. 

They absolutely deserve it MUCH more than that soldier who looted that toy.

Call me crazy, but instead, perhaps... you should at least consider refocusing your energies into giving your love and empathy to the people of Ukraine instead?

Like, you can't be that dense, can you? 

You simply can't seem to put yourself in the place of the Ukrainian people, and see how utterly inappropriate and tone deaf and just jaw droppingly clueless your ""Oh my, how sweet!"" style comment must seem to them? 

------------------------

I mean, I can't believe I have to try to explain this even further to you... But ok... I'll try! 

Let's say the Nazi army, or Putin's army, or ISIS, or someone of that horrific ilk, invades your neighborhood and does horrific unspeakable things... including things to your family (and pets) right in front of you. 

And then some clueless douche on the Internet responds with ""Oh my, how sweet!"" in response to seeing what one of those invading soldiers looted from your country? 

------------------------------

So that's exactly what you are doing here on this particular subreddit. 

And your response to my shock at your tone deafness is to double down and just try to argue how right you are, and try to gaslight us into assuming that the soldier who looted that toy is a good person, because he wanted to bring a toy back home? 

------------------------------

Also on that last note... 

I can ABSOLUTELY assure you: even the most dangerous and vile of psychopaths of history have been readily known to present great gifts to family, and those they try to court. 

In fact, psychos and other low empathy disorders (such as Malignant Narcissists) often do so in an EXCESSIVE fashion, basically as a misguided broken attempt to buy other people's love, which in psychology is known as: 

""Love Bombing"". 

A quite fitting term I would say, given the war situation! 

------------------------------

But yes, in short... at the very least: 

I would say your sickening ""Oh, my, how sweet!"" outburst... 

is so (SO) utterly misplaced given the suffering of the Ukraine people at the hands of this military. 

I don't get why you want to let yourself be so easily tricked and fooled when a pyscho tries to buy your love?

Because I have to say, in this case, all it took was a photo of a looted toy, to purchase your misguided love, and have you make such a misguided statement. 

Not to mention how you're totally assuming that the toy was stolen for a child back home (when in fact a lot of grown men enjoy playing with remote controlled cars!). 

------------------------

All in all... 

That's quite a cheap price you are selling yourself out for, to go onto a Ukraine-plight focused sight and say that the soldier who stole that must absolutely be a good person, and utter your cringe ""How sweet!"" exclamations. 

Is that what you want for yourself?
