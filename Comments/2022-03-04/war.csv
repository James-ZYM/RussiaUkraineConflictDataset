I think this is because of the information spread. Currently it is much more effective and besides this our generation didn't fight in any wars and we don't have a complete sight, only the footage but we know that the only thing we want is to avoid any kind of war. This is also true for the people in the cold war but it strengthened since then because of the mentioned reasons. And we can claim that our generation is truly weaker due to the comfort and the capitalist world.
In the other hand, they were on the verge of a nuclear war not once but a lot more time. They were in constant fear and they didn't have the appropriate informations wether it could happen or not. In the current situation I think this won't happen, they just use it to cause fear and panic which I said, is stronger.
To summary, I would say that this cannot be compared, both sides had their reason to fear. They could get used to it that sometimes the relations are fair and sometimes not so much that could lead them to the WW III. Our generation couldn't experience it yet, so it is a question of the future.

You can look it up on Wikipedia, but the current president basically staged a coup in 2016 to prevent a real coup by the Turkish army and has gained more power ever since.

2. So if you consider that it was during a coup to scare the people and make it look real, pilots were told to fly in low altitudes over the city and cause sonic booms on purpose, yet they still got arrested afterwards for participating in the so called coup. 

The Turkish army is basically guarding the heritage of Atatürk, which is ‚secularity’ and ‚democracy‘. As soon as the government is acting against democratic and secular values, they just take over. Previous coups in Turkey happened in 1962, 1971, 1980, 1997… sooo we all know what a real coup looks like and so did Erdogan, which is why he staged it himself to prevent a real one.

Anyway, Trump got the idea in 2018 that if he could get the president of Ukraine to announce that Ukraine was investigating Joe Biden for corruption, he would destroy Joe Biden's candidacy before it began.

Trump, utterly uninterested in US foreign policy goals or the welfare of the Ukrainian people, had two points of leverage against Ukraine. He could delay or illegaly block the $400M of military aid that congress had allocated to support Ukraine's ongoing conflict in the Donbass region, and he could deny the newly elected Zelenskyy a face to face meeting, which he wanted to establish his legitimacy. 

He essentially relayed to Zelenskyy that if Zelenskyy didn't get on TV and announce he was investigating Joe Biden for corruption and pro-Clinton interference in the 2016 campaign by the Ukrainian deep state, Ukraine would not get the $400M of aid that they critically needed to keep fighting Russia.

Someone blew the whistle on the outrageousness of this foreign extortion scheme and its rank corruption. Later, several state department officials bravely lined up before congress to tell Trump's disgusting story and the shame he brought upon his office, and our country. Their names are Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, Ambassador Bill Taylor, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and George Kent, if I'm not forgetting any. These people are patriots.

Is there any visible marks of beating or punishment? Otherwise it is just an assumption.

I can give you another explanation of his behavior: before invasion, Putin propaganda brainwashed him that he is a hero who is going to save Ukrainian people from ""nazi"", and that civilians will greet him as a such. However, after the invasion he found out that civilians hate russian soldiers and want them to leave, and that russian military forces are war criminals. And now he is re-considering his own responsibility. Also he probably haven't eaten for a while - because Putin gave invasion forces almost no food.

794,[],False,,justnapkinmath,,,[],,,,text,t2_c4a5me33,False,False,"Overall, I think you should read a lot about how nuclear weapon command and control processes work. Your questions are good, but are coming from a lack of understanding of what happens after a button is pushed.

First off, even though a leader may push a button, it takes more than one person to launch that warhead. In reality, all the “nuclear football” does is send a message to the specific launch facility to fire. Then the leaders in the military would have to agree and launch an ICBM. So if any nefarious use of this system occurs, there are double checks in place to confirm that both military leaders and the country leader agree. Nothing gets autolaunched. Yes it takes multiple minutes to start a launch. Thats by design and until recently would not be an issue (introduction of hypersonic ICBMs may shorten the time required to make a decision).

Second, MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) is the reason that nuclear weapons are not used as offensive weapons. Because the country originally firing the ICBMs would be destroyed as well, the only real reason to use a nuclear weapon would be a last ditch effort in a losing war. Unless a nuclear power gets invaded, theres no way that any leader or military would launch one.

Third, you should watch some videos on Rules for Rulers. In reality, all actions of rulers must have the agreement of the people in the country that really control the power. If a leader was to attempt to launch a nuclear weapon without his supporters agreeing, he/she would likely be removed from office from within. It really would have to make a demonstrative positive/neutral outcome, and given the current support for sanctions of this scale, that is certainly unlikely to exist.


Answering some other questions:

How do we know that a country has a nuclear weapon?

- If a country is attempting to build a nuclear weapon from scratch, it takes massive facilities and specific equipment to make it possible. Centrifuges are typically given as a good example of an equipment that has heavily controlled sales.

Without these centrifuges, you cannot refine the uranium far enough to use it for a nuclear weapon. This is one example, but there are plenty of these equipment pieces and buildings that are required. Easily tracked using satellites due to their scale.


Hacking into Silos:

- Nuclear silos are not connected to the public internet. There is private (Military) infrastructure in place so that nothing in the system is accessible from any point on the internet. Nothing to hack here. No risk of accidental launches…just not how the systems are designed. Every “perception” of a launch is traced down, nothing is left up to chance here. Most of this is manual, by design, so that no system could be spoofed.


Overall, the risk is much lower than what you are feeling. I hear you that we should work towards removing all nuclear weapons from arsenals, but until all countries can feel safe from the threat of invasion, they will not be giving them up. We live after it was invented, it will always exist for the rest of time, barring significant changes on the world stage. 

Not going to cover the rest as they are just so off base that it isn’t worth typing out. Try not to use specific examples when referencing crazy people. Some people will be insulted and you can clarify your questions without insulting others. This will take you far in life if you remember it.",c2a5cc06407e710af13986e9569c76d7e8fdbd29,True,False,,,,,0,1646360245,,0,{},hz9kd3e,False,t3_t61bf1,False,True,t3_t61bf1,/r/war/comments/t61bf1/my_questions_about_nuclear_war/hz9kd3e/,1646360256,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646331445.0,

The point of NATO is certainly not to prevent Russia from invading random countries. The point of NATO *was* to act as a counter to the very real and existential Soviet threat. The point of NATO today is much less clear. Literally the only time Article 5 has ever been invoked is after 9/11 - dragging our allies into a shitty war with no clear objective or enemy. These days the existential threat we need to be worried about is China - there's no need to be actively involved in border issues between Russia and its neighbors, especially when Russia shows no serious interest in expansionism.

Ever. That's what makes this an even greater foreign policy blunder. We're dangling a nonexistent carrot. 

NATO article 5 states that if one country is attacked, all of NATO must respond. So bringing Ukraine into NATO is literally a step toward WWIII. It puts us ""eyeball to eyeball"" with the power that NATO ostensibly exists to counter. It's also worth noting that NATO has a technologically far superior army to Russia and would surely win in a shooting war. Guess what Russian military doctrine says they get to do when faced with a technologically superior army.

In 2008 NATO issued a statement something akin to: ""we look forward to welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into NATO in the future."" Georgia took this as tacit permission to confront Russia, thinking that they'd be backed by NATO if things went tits up. Well when Russia *logically retaliated to Georgia's aggression* and things did go tits up for them, guess who didn't show up? What Russia did in Georgia is very important because it's likely a template for Ukraine. They stepped in, absolutely crippled their military, and then pulled out. They even left the original administration in place. It's a move that one could easily imagine the US doing in a similar situation. I mean, if there's one common thread throughout our (US) history of foreign conflicts it's: ""we're not going to conquer you, we're just going to fuck you up."" The US doesn't exactly have a stellar record when it comes to meddling in foreign countries either, I'll remind you. 

Crimea is a super weird one because it basically is and was Russian. Ethnically it is almost entirely Russian. Russia controls the Kerch Strait and the Crimean Bridge and has for a long time. Russia even had military stations in Crimea. They didn't have to invade - they were already there! If a referendum had been held in Crimea on being absorbed into Russia, it would have passed before or after the annexation. There were even calls by people to have a referendum vote after the annexation as a way to help calm things down in the region. Unfortunately the Kremlin didn't want to do this as it would also sort of admit fault or at least question the original act. Moreover, they had little trust that the West would actually honor the results of the referendum or play fair (especially since we had just finished meddling in Ukraine's democratic process to get the guy we wanted in power).

The cruel irony of this whole situation is that Russia views themselves in almost the exact same way we do. They have a very similar approach to foreign affairs except that they don't have the same level of credit or the same innate border security that the US has. They meddle with other countries about as much as we do and that makes us look really hypocritical to them when we get all upset about what they do.",f61121e68b97cb4c9729255ac77c65a430be1177,True,False,,,,,0,1646340582,,0,{},hz8bm8v,False,t3_t5lw2v,False,True,t1_hz85m8m,/r/war/comments/t5lw2v/2017_us_phd_scholar_stephen_cohen_describes/hz8bm8v/,1646340597,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646311782.0,

“Why not attack the convoy that’s coming your way” Ukraine is dealing with what’s on their side of the field right now. Gotta keep the other team from scoring before you can make it across the field to their goal if that analogy makes sense to anyone. 

And a convoy 40 miles long in my assumption after some time in the Military isn’t just vehicles. It’s troops, it’s capabilities and it’s armament. I highly doubt that a convoy stretching for 40 miles is nothing but APCs/tanks and even it is, they have a lot of weapon systems and MG’s pointed to the sky very quickly if something comes for it.

They export most of it to MENA (Middle-East North-Africa) - so maybe they can pressure their friends into coming to a quick solution or you will most likely get riots if they lose their wheat.

I think this is why the GCC (Gulf Coalition Council - Saudi, UAE etc.) has refused to take sides over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

I would just like to point out that Iraq had an amazing agricultural system that was completely destroyed during the US occupation... coincidences everywhere you look...

On top of that to say no Christians today are persecuting the Jews is absurd. I specifically  said Evangelicals initially for a reason. Jews are being increasingly attacked by Evangelical Christians and it only increased when people like Trump was in office. To completely  ignore the various churches and religions which are guiding this persecution is insane. Not all Muslims persecute jews but their are various factions and sects in their religion that does and it's  the same with Christianity.

Just one example:

""In 1095 the newly elected Pope Urban II called on his followers to liberate Jerusalem, the holy land, from Muslim nonbelievers.

Whilst this call did not directly mention Jews, some Christians led their own crusades. Their aim was to destroy all enemies and non-believers of Christianity, not just those in Jerusalem.

The effects were devastating for the Jews. Thousands were targeted by Crusaders in the Rhineland in Germany in 1096. The crusaders aimed to entirely eliminate the Jewish population, either by converting them to Christianity, or, if they refused, by killing them.""

На кадрах ви бачите одне з жахів війни, що розв'язала Росія проти Ураїни 24 лютого 2022 року. Якщо комусь не зрозуміло, то темношкірий чоловік погрожує ножем, пропускаючи в потяг лише ""своїх"".

Ти достойний ганьби.

Every time I saw posts about blm I maintained it. Every life is important. I find it unacceptable to put someone's life above others because of skin color or nationality. I thought so. I sincerely believed that people who were victims of racism would never repeat that evil. Evil that affected their people, their nationality, their community. But...  
In the video you can see one of the horrors of the war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine on February 24, 2022. If someone does not understand, a black man threatens with a knife, letting in the train only his group. On the train from Lviv to Poland. In the evacuation train. Taking the place of a child and her mother. Isn't this racism? Isn't this Nazism? Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 do not board the trains. They do not board the trains because they are defending their land. They do not board the trains, because first of all they save children, women and the elderly. They do not board the trains, because they are real men. Everyone knows the rule that those who are weaker should be rescued first. Save those who need it first. Children. Women. The old ones. Not men. It doesn't matter what color your skin or eye incision is. It doesn't matter what nationality you are. If you threaten mother and her child with a knife because you are saving your ass, you are a piece of shit. You are not worthy of respect. You are worthy of shame.  
Let this be my manifesto: every time I hear about all these slogans that blacks are being humiliated and oppressed everywhere, I will show this video and dozens of other videos!  
And let all those who say that racism against white people does not exist close to the years. Open your eyes and watch this video! To be so ashamed!  
I urge you to post this message as much as possible. It is enough to be silent, it is enough to show the situation one-sidedly!

I’m critical of videos of death so listen to me.. Those people are dead. Real blood. Some executed.

Same with the European identity issue (I think this is two things...people empathising with those that looks similar to them and are similar in culture but also the fact that Europe has largely been quite peaceful compared to other areas of the globe so its a little more noteworthy because it goes against our understanding of the continent over the last 80 years.

I think there also is a fear that some Middle Easterners will come to West as migrants or asylum seekers. Immigration has become a hot button issue here as ethnic mixing successfully is more often than not a rarity in our human history.

Another myside bias is with the support for Israel with so many Jewish people in the US as well as a general guilt for the horror of the holocaust. So the picture is further complicated.

With respect to Afghanistan a major issue there was the fact that it's really a question of Pashtun-Wahabiism supremacy with no proper sense of a nation state causing a highly inept and corruption military that was actually of reasonable size and fairly well equipped. Part of the issue was the Special forces of Afghanistan were successful but many ordinary soldiers got high a lot, many defected and corruption stopped them from getting supplies or paid. The perversion of the chai teaboy phenomenon meant that people were a little less sympathetic (we saw a lot of this footage on our news) (that's not to say that Ukrainian corruption hasn't gone unnoticed in the weet and I reckon is actually a concern for EU member States given they want to join the club).

I would say that cultural familiarity is a big aspect. My parents, both westerners, worked in Iraq in 1984 as doctors and have every sympathy for the destruction of the country and they loom up old friends often to find they died in conflict as bystanders.
