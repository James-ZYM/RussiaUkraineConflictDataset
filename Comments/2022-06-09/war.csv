You’re really trying to tie a lot of things together that just don’t add up. 
Nazi’s we’re not right wing.  Commies want you to believe that but it isn’t so. 
Republicans seek small government with more power in the states versus federal/centralized.  (You’re confused because of the RINOs.) hence the name, republic-ans. 
Democrats believe in a collective democracy, basically mob rule. 

The Nazis were a centralized/socialist system. All power to the central government. 

Trump was NOT involved with Russia as the recent trial proved.  
We SHOULD have improved relations with Russia after the Cold War and this wouldn’t be happening.  This is perhaps the US’s greatest diplomatic mistake. 
Instead, they pushed NATO right to Russia’s border (something we had said we wouldn’t do). 

By not building a mutual bond we’ve all but created a massive alliance AGAINST us. 

In the coming years, as China ascends, the issues will become more plain to see.  
Russia, China, India and Iran will form an anti NATO alliance. The west will deteriorate.  

On a side note. The media lied about Trump from day one. He was undoing the globalist take over of the US. You will understand this once it’s too late.

Personally, I couldn’t give a toss about partygate, half of the British public was on Scarborough beach whilst the government furloughed them to stay at home. The only ones with a genuine reason to complain are the ones that followed the rules thoroughly, otherwise I can’t think of any other word than hypocrite. I myself tried to follow them but broke them occasionally to visit friends. 

It’s about time we stopped squabbling about police reforms and equality, and put our minds to where problems really are happening. Don’t get me wrong, I want equality, a social benefit system, the NHS but people make agendas that the media (BBC) amplifies about things that aren’t a problem. 

Whilst this happens, Mr Putin can sit and watch and use it to his advantage as he has so rightly done. We saw the invasion of Crimea under a Obama/Biden administration. Nothing happened during Donald Trump’s reign or with Brexit and Covid. But we do see Ukraine once again invaded under another Biden administration whilst Boris is nearly ousted.
