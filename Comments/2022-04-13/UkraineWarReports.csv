Getting used to how life goes during the war - might be the best description.

View from a city in the central part of Ukraine. About 150km away from the nearest fights.

Life as usual, as much, as it could be with:

* curfews as a part of schedule
* 2 to 6 air raid alerts per day. Sometimes with explosions heard.
* roadblocks and military checkpoints scattered over the area.
* huge numbers of people from heavily shelled regions coming in with basically nothing aside from IDs. As a result - a lot of spots where these people can receive humanitarian aid. Mostly volunteers working there, but everything highly coordinated and supplies are being delivered on a regular basis.

Otherwise - we are doing okay. Supermarkets, small grocery stores and even coffee shops are working at the moment(unlike first days of war, when small businesses were mostly closed and supermarkets were running out of supply of long shelf life food). Utilities like power, running water had no issues here. Workers of these are heroes, as even in Kharkiv they are fixing communications after shellings.

However my people suffered under authoritarian imperialist murdering nutbags on a cleansing mission to. My grandpa wouldn't hear a nice word said about the Japanese his whole life, cause they killed his mates. Treated them like animals in fact. 

I don't know what you guys hear, and I am no scholar, but I read a LOT of history books. I watch various sides of the story where available. WW2 is one of the subjects I am particularly interested in, the political side as well as warfare. I am well aware of the sacrifices the USSR made. I am also well aware of *how* they achieved their victory, and what they did to countries that fell under their sphere of influence afterwards.  

I don't know what you hear on the media over there, but yes I get western orientated media. I get the left, centre and right wing. I get pro and anti russian information (yeah I read TASS and RT at times). The Russian lies are obvious. 

What I know is that Putin feels like he has been slighted by the west. I get that Russia did the US favours with Afghanistan, and was treated like shit. History would have been entirely different if the west had of helped Russian instead of reveling in its failure. I also know that early on, old mate didn't like what was unfolding in Ukraine regarding their sovereignty. I've seen video's of Putin and his friends admitting to shipping buses of Russian dudes across Ukraine's borders to vote in elections. 

Its this sort of underhanded attempts to influence an outcome that have escalated to get to where things are today. It didn't have to be this way. What I see is an insurgency funded in Donbass/Luhansk by the Russian government and then when Ukraine fights back they say ""oh they are murdering the innocent people"". Russia doesn't give a shit about the people of Donbass and Luhansk, they are forcibly conscripting them now and throwing them in the front lines. I see poor dudes running down the street trying to get away from conscription squads. Thats what I see. 

I don't know anything about cutting testicles off but the Bucha stuff is horseshit. Those corpses were old. There's forensic specialists over there now checking out what is going on, but all your media and government will say is that its lies. They've got videos of a Russian vehicle shooting some poor woman on a bike and old mate Peskov looked a bit uncomfortable when he was shown that. Your media can cut it as ""oh they imposed the image of the V on the tank, its lies"", but it seems there is no low they won't stoop too. 

Re your video, its easy to find someone these days who will discount what is an obvious truth, so I'd caution you against believing that one crazy voice in a chorus that disagrees with it. You can always find someone these days who agrees with your opinion, no matter what it is. Look at Trump, he's a total narcissistic liar but he can still find 10s of millions of people who believe him. 

What the Russian government is doing is true 1984 shit. 

 I'm not trying to paint the Ukrainians as angels, but war and killing civilians is never the answer. Russia is the aggressor in Donbass and Ukraine. There is nothing good to come of this for Ukraine, Russia, or the world. 

In other circumstances I'd say its nice to hear the opinion of someone on the other side of the world. But not in this instance.

Thats not how it works anymore. Conquering is more expensive than dealing business in today's world, especially when your own land is rich. Did you looked at map of Russia? We have so land, its fucked up. Just by some luck half of our land was almost not inhabited. And we have only around 140 mill people to develop it. We don't need more land at all. And funny thing, Russia would've profited so much from slave labor back in the Imperial days but we didn't do it, god knows why when half of the world didn't mind it.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

You are a hypocrite of the highest order and do not deserve any sympathy. 
No one is condoning innocent lives being lost in the war instigated by NATO, i am just pointing out your hypocrisy. Had NATO not set up military bases close to Russia, not done regime change in Ukraine in 2014, not provoked Russia so much to the brink of war, Russia would not have bombed Ukraine. You people literally gave Russia no choice and wanted Russia to go to war so save your pathetic crocodile tears.

By your own pathetic logic of trying Putin for war crimes, you really need to start with Western leaders who first became war criminals like Bush, Tony blair, Obama, Trump, Biden, Clinton.

NATO is a murderous entity. Anyone who supports is a psychopath. Are you not able to look into its past track of genocidal history in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Pakistan? Millions killed. It boggles my mind how cry baby sheep like are still so gullible that you continue to believe NATO gives a rats ass about Ukraine. An entity that happily bombed Afghans in schools, weddings, hospitals you name it DOES NOT CARE ABOUT HUMAN LIFE.
Do you get it? Do you see how cringe you sound when you blindly believe NATO propagandas? Shame on you for supporting NATO‚Äôs supply of millions $$ weapons of OUR TAX MONEY to Nazis in Ukraine leading to further death and destruction, rolling the drums of world war 3, than actually conducting any action for peace keeping.

This is your NATO, literally using Ukraine as a ploy to weaken Russia so US can continue maintaining to be the empire.

""Ukrainian officials quickly sounded the alarm about the potential implications of the attack. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that ""if (the plant) blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl,"" and Zelensky said that such an incident would mean ""the end of Europe.""

The fact that the Koch Brothers changed teams is indicative that they knew that Russia was going to attack Ukraine., This also proves they are teaming up with team East. Biden should freeze all of Koch's assets to help pay for the war they support.  The fact, all global oil companies have been working together for about a year on maximizing profits and driving inflation through the roof shows they are working too unite with team East vast oil riches like Russia and the Saudis with the second and third largest energy consumers China and India. With the West having to go green team East is banking on China and India staying the course with fossil fuels therefore the earth is toast.

If the West can struggle through and crush Russia now the rest of team East will fizzle out but either way global economy is toast.

No, you are just straight up lying, claiming that NATO means Russia no harm when this is a conflict that goes back to the first millenium. Russia has always been a nail in the eye of the anglo-germanic sphere of influence over europe, since the times of Napoleon and even before that, culminating in many wars, the worst being WW2 which is still in living memory. 

That you expect Russians to just forget history is absurd, no people and cultures dont change, and the west still harbours the same hate for Russia they did back in the 18th century. It never stopped, even after the defeat of the nazis at their hands. The west was still planning on invading Russia.

&gt;Dedication to fear mongering is not a determination of the international policy of other nations. It's sad to see Russia never got past the cold War. The rest of the world completely moved on, but here sits Russia, still licking it's wounds from WW2. Have you ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? Because we're seeing one in real time right now.

The cold war never ended. No one who has opened a history book believes it was over, the way Russia was treated after the collapse of the USSR just further proves this and your cold war with China, you have always been at war with EurAsia and will be at war with them until one side is eradicated. 

&gt;Your answer is bullshit, and Russia STILL has opportunity to stop what they fear by stopping this invasion and becoming a true world partner. Or they can continue down a path that will eventually lead other nations to decide the Russian Federation can no longer exist. If you want Russia to be what Germany was after WW2 ended, this is how you get it.

So what you want is a military qurantine of Russia (NATO), where every inch of Russias borders has a US FOB on it, with US radars spying on every move they make? And once Russia is defanged and contained you can get to work on dismantling them from the inside huh? With your CIA operations and propaganda and cultural imperialism.

Also, it seems that you don't know who Bandera was either. You describe him as Nazi, but it seems that he was not:

&gt;...Bandera's expectation that the Nazi regime would post factum recognize an independent fascist Ukraine as an Axis ally proved to be wrong. In 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B had soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that ""... the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the Reichskommissariat which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated..."". On 5 July, Bandera was transferred to Berlin. On 15 September 1941 Bandera and leading OUN members were arrested by the Gestapo.  
In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp's special barrack for high-profile political prisoners Zellenbau. In April 1944, Bandera and his deputy Yaroslav Stetsko were approached by a Reich Security Main Office official to discuss plans for diversions and sabotage against the Soviet Army. In September 1944, Bandera was released by the German authorities and allowed to return to Ukraine in the hope that his partisans would harass the Soviet troops, which by that time had handed the Germans major defeats. However, in renewed pursuit of his dream of an independent Ukraine, he had his partisans fight against both Soviets and Germans.

So, it seems that he used Nazis to pursuit his own agenda. And he used them much more efficiently than Stalin did, when Stalin signed the Peace treaty with Nazis.

It is unlucky that I am delayed because of my projects with my company, but I am still deeply interested in this conversation. I hope the delay does not negatively destroy your interest, as well.

There is surely more I would like to say about the above, but I give a quick answer for now on your questions. 

1. I will watch the video you linked regarding the Nazism in Ukraine. I will identify the part of the protest and I will let you know what I gather from it. I gave a quick watch of it and can say I am unfamiliar with the potential protest. I will rewatch to give a better answer.

2. Yes I am aware of who Bandera was. I actually made him a point of discussion for one of my questions (question 7). 

Your thoughts on Bucha made me want to stay consistent to that conversation and I was planning to first ask you a question on the situation with Bucha and Irpin. That question number is question 16. 

I hope we can continue discussion of Bucha first on question 16 and then I would be happy to return to the agenda I have made where we will talk about Bandera at some point.

Yes they normally had a village head but those heads had practically no power. We then had agricultural societies which had a little more structure but there wasn't a lot of power in that structure.

Now as for your definition of fascist. It is wrong. No not everyone right of Marx is a fascist.
""Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.""
This is just the quick most understood definition. The reason I am using it is the vast majority use it. Words only have the meaning we give them. Words evolve. Definitions change. Still if you use a different definition from someone else you will be arguing 2 different things.

Now let's break down that definition. ""Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism""; this isn't definition authoritarian-right quadrant and thus excludes libertarian left and right and excludes the authoritarian left. Boom we just poked a few holes in your native of ""everyone right of Marx is a Nazi"".
On to the 2nd part of the definition. ""characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe."" These parts are fairly clear and need no clarification

Now let's combine those together. We have some ""on the far right""; This I think can be argued a bit with the intention of changing it's definition. As I think Hitler and Mussolini are more main stream than people realize. For example Hitler was a vegan and cared about animal rights. These 2 things are both most commonly on the left. If you pick everything apart he wasn't and still isn't as far right as the Taliban or Al-Qaeda or even most theocracies such as the Vatican. Mussolini was right of Hitler but both I would say we're basically take Trump or Ronald Reagan and make them more authoritarian and you get Mussolini. Add a little more authoritarian and slightly left (but not by much. As in like .5%) and you get Hitler.

As for the rest it is pretty similar to the definition you used. The biggest issue I have is with you defining everyone as a Nazi that is right of Marx.

This issue I have with calling everyone Nazi is the same with calling everything r*pe. So many people have diluted the definition. Now r*pe still includes the worst thing that can be done to a person but it is not the only thing in there. We have a group of words people should be using instead of r*pe in many circumstances and yet choose to make it sound worse which has gotten the majority to have more doubt to accusations. The words should be s*xual a*sault. 
(Yes I censor myself for 2 reasons. 1 to help weed out the children and to keep from being censored completely over just a few words. Clearly Nazi is ok here but idk about the rest. Even so we don't need kids looking these things up. Not something that kids should be seeing)
Using the word r*pe doesn't instantly cause discust in the same way it used to. Where in the old days someone being accused of r*pe instantly had people looking their way with a if you're guilty we hope for the chair, axe or rope and now that is more like what kind of r*pe.

Important side note I am a historian that was planning on going into politics. I have read the communist manifesto, mien k*mpf and although I did not directly read any books from Mussolini (mostly because I couldn't find any) I did read about him and his ideals.) The same thing as Mussolini for Stalin, Mao, Lenin, etc. I got out of the idea of politics because if a good person goes in they become bad and a bad person going in becomes worse. There are no good people in politics. Hell a perfect example is Ying Zheng/Zhao Zheng which is better known as Qin Shi Huang. Someone who started out as a fairly good king to his own people but was extremely warlike for reasons unknown. Yet after assassination attempts he became more and more doctorial and obsessed with immortality and as such managed to basically break his own empire before he died and was eating mercury and as such died fairly young. This is what allowed for the rise of the Han. Which ultimately fell the same way just taking a few hundred years for China to break again. This is why there is always a joke in world history game let's plays and videos about world history of China breaking and putting itself back together and repeating the cycle. There is some truth to it but ironically that is true in every nation. The USA has followed the same path as Chinese dynasties and so has every other nation. Size is what changes speed. This comes from the rules for rulers. The issue with size is the larger the nation the more keys needed to maintain power and the more keys needed the shorter the reign. This is why small dictatorships are so stable and most of the time are only destabilized when a weak dictator comes into power or outside intervention. Saddam's Iraq was extremely stable for what it was dealing with until America toppled his regime. Which yes Saddam was a bad guy but you have to admit Iraq has basically collapsed without his regime. America has more blood on its hands than it realizes. Think the train problem. A bunch of people standing on the tracks or one. Do nothing and the train hits the group but switch the tracks and you personally chose to have the train hit the one. You can change this scenario any way to decide how much blood is on someone's hands for example the 2 tracks have do nothing and all the people Saddam would of tortured or killed would still receive Saddam's cruelty and kill Saddam. But now what's on the other side of Saddam down the bend. All the people he would have saved. Boom killing Saddam just turned into killing all the people he saved.",760ff5df4dfa1dc2a604304832cd7f6a0660d721,True,False,,,,,0,1649792798,,0,{},i4gyt7n,False,t3_u0p3gv,False,True,t1_i4g7i1g,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u0p3gv/pro_russian_marine_le_pen_unlikely_to_win_the/i4gyt7n/,1649792815,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649763998.0,

War is a tool to secure your own security yes. Same way the Americans threatened nuclear holocaust because of Cuba. Countries have been invaded for less than wanting to join an enemy alliance. 

&gt;The level of mental gymnastics you have to do to convince yourself that you‚Äôre right has to be exhausting.  

Not one bit.

Your argument would hold weight if the west had not invaded Russia 3 times with the last war having the compelete eradication of the Russian people as a goal.

What says that in 100 years when nukes can be shot down with high tech weapons, that you wont go for round 4?

Terror tactics? You mean war? 


&gt;The fact that you think your military is so big and bad is adorable. 

Bet you think Ukraine is winning huh? 

&gt;You guys got fucked up by the Finns, the fucking FINNS!!! (No offense to my Finnish brothers and sisters out there) Do I need to bring up the stats from the Winter War?

No, just ask the germans how bad the Red Army was lol. They still cry about the rape of Berlin. And in the end, Finland surrendered and the USSR got what they asked for and more. Its called sacrifice. 

&gt;Look it up if you want a good laugh. No one is forcing anyone to join NATO. It's a voluntary pact. Another thing: Have you noticed that many of the Eastern Bloc countries have joined NATO since the Soviet Union fell? Don't you think that's a little bit telling? Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, need I go on?

It dosent matter if its voluntary, that has no bearing on the fact that its still a threat. 

&gt;Maybe if the Russian government didn't treat its people like shit, then maybe these countries wouldn't feel the need to jump ship and join NATO as soon as they can. Maybe once you understand that, then maybe you will understand why the whole world hates you.

Uh no. Thats just ahistorical bullshit. Clinton himself said NATO would expand regardless of Russias behaviour, peaceful or not. 

&gt;If NATO decided to put boots on the ground, you would be SLAUGHTERED, and I think you know that.

""Our 30+ country coalition would stomp you hurr hurr"" yeah no shit, the Nazis found out the hard way that fighting the whole developed world dosent turn out well. But Russia has nukes. They have to establish a security sphere while they can, nukes wont always be relevant. In the future they will likely be obsolote and nothing will stop the west from invading Russia again, you already did 3 times. 

 
&gt;Can't even beat a military made up of fucking volunteers and civilians that show more heart and courage than any Russian dipshit over in Ukraine right now ü§£ü§£ü§£

So i was right? You think Ukraine is winning? Sadly you are mistaken lol, look at any of the warmaps, and the ground is solid now too. The eastern forces are about to be encircled and Mariupol has basically fallen, freeing up 20,000 Russian troops, furthermore 30,000+ troops have been sent into Ukraine and China just delivered weapons in Serbia that will make its way to Russia.

As I show you, even svastika itself was used in many different countries and nations well before Nazi appeared.

The Azov batalion is just one example of Nazism in Ukraine. And no, they use a Nazi symbol after the Nazi appeared, and I didn't say that I hate all of the Ukrainians. The commanders and most of the army are Nazis, there are a lot of proofs and the most visible example is their symbol. They have chevrons and badges that are swastikas and I don't know how you still think they are not Nazis.

&gt;Suggestions to google something about Bandera do not proof your point either. If we would judge Russians by contradicting figures in their history, it will be not productive as well. I hope you do not suggest me to make any assumptions about Russians by Ivan the Terrible or Stalin, do you?

Did you just try to disprove me and not provide any counter proof? ""If they still praise a verified nazi who killed a lot of people they can't be blamed for that!"" Why? Why can't they? Do you think we praise Ivan Grozniy or Stalin as a hero because he (how you like to say) killed a lot of people or starved a lot of people to death? No, they are praised because they won wars, helped our country to not fall on its knees. And what did Stepan Bandera do? Killed a lot of polish and jewish people, wanted to join Nazis, started the hate to Russians, thats what he did.

&gt;Firstly, the Azov batalion has a nazi symbolics literally on them.

This is a lie. If you mean the symbol which resembles ""N"" + ""I"" together, then it is not a svastika. They actually explained its meaning and it has nothing with Nazi symbolism. As you can see, this the original Nazi symbol resembles Slavic symbol for Stribog, the God of Air. [https://symbolikon.com/meanings/slavic-symbols-meanings/](https://symbolikon.com/meanings/slavic-symbols-meanings/) Does that mean for you that all Slavs are Nazi?

By the way, other symbols on that page, like Svarozhich, Hors resemble Nazi Svastika much better and they appeared much earlier then Nazi themselves. You can find a lot of symbols like svastika (which is the most well known nazi symbol). For example, look at this coat of arms. Would you call all members of Boreiko house Nazis because of it?  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreyko\_coat\_of\_arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreyko_coat_of_arms)

So, if you justify your hatred against the entire country just because there is Azov batalion which uses a symbol which looks like a nazi symbol to you, then you are wrong. As I show you, even svastika itself was used in many different countries and nations well before Nazi appeared.

India is trying to stay friendly with its old ally without incurring in US sanctions, that would seriously damage the country. I don't think Modhi is up to the task, I'm afraid he'll fuck up sooner or later, with dire consequences for the Indian people. They need to be very careful with what they say and do.

  
your ""some EU"" is Fidesz's Hungary only, and they already lost a money and influence for this. best case scenario for Russia: they kick themselves out of EU and become Belarus 2.0. Nobody in their sane mind would follow.

  
Trump is going to get indicted for the failed coup, I wouldn't count on him taking office anytime soon. Also Republicans and right wing parties in EU are showing the same pattern, pretending they never had anything to do with Putin and the rest of the Russian nazi, with different outcomes.  


in the meantime in Russia: western investments are gone for good, its only power left (the army) has already made a joke of itself losing the battle of Kyiv, and its best ally, China, is playing its own game as usual.
