You have to look at profitability. Different companies and nations return at different levels, like some need anything over 30, some anything over 60 etc. I believe Russia is around 50 but it's been a while since I looked into such things. We do love comparative economics, but it doesn't really always equate to reality. 

Like we see if a movie is number one and another movie is number 2, people basically say the number 2 movie flopped. Even if the number one movie made 1 billion and the number 2 movie made 850 million, just shy of some records... we act like they went broke, when they're still making bank. 

If Russia can sell over 80 mostly, they are making mad money. Period. At least for now (later inflation and other economic factors can change things perhaps).

However, to he fair, there is a complexity in the fact that I'm pretty sure these movies might be the first time the word ""furious"" has ever been pluralized, and as a noun. It's a gray area too because (and I literally am speaking to a professional editor I know asking this), they are claiming that default would be to not pluralize that word at all. 

Though, language tends to change when people do things regardless of whatever ""rules"" there are. 

""10 furious"" could be a way forward. In speech most would likely say ""10 furiouses"" but in writing that becomes more like ""10 fur (m)ouses"" sound. 

So the part in the link about avoiding confusion, could lead to  the logical drift into ""furious's"" within that context. 

So perhaps the default proper is actually no plural, but it's also essentially a ""new word"" and so to argue with my editor, I'd say that at least in speech with a noun context you could add an s to plural furious. 

She probably won't agree.

so the people are not nazis but the government (with a Jewish president but yeah we also ignore that..). And the proof is that the government is paying the azov regiment which therefore legitimates the war? Or am I missing your point here? 
And only Ukraine has the nerve to pay such regiments?
What is with the militant Wagner group founded by the Russian neonazi Dmitry Utkin who was awarded around 2016 with the order of courage and was even in the Kreml for that later?
Why do these people be part of the fight AGAINST nazis since 2014? They were on the crimea and in the Donbas and fight for Russia?!

Why do Russians who want to fight nazis… support nazis in their own lines?

Just the first link. From the Russian side this was deleted. The guy has a Volknot and a skull which is remarkable close to the 3rd ss panzer division were they just added a helmet. Both signs are used in Germany from nazis.

So your argument is… the elected parliament of Ukraine is far right. Or the neonazis are in the government and your proof is that they pay azov… so on the other hand you have russia who also directly pays the Wagner group which is known to be also right but this is ok. And even further … I don’t get at ALL how this would justify a war at all???? As you said the population are no Nazis. And even if the government would be Nazis (which your only proof is that they pay azov) this doesn’t justify the war?!

But sometimes what they decide to take down isn't what the majority of people think is worthy of attack.

 It's as evolved as much your phone or pc is now. You can't do much these days without Google or Amazon or a million other companies collecting your data. The only way to avoid all of this is to become anonymous yourself-personally. It's a PITA and is restrictive of what you can normally do, but if you don't want to leave a footprint, you have to put in the work. So you take the good with the bad: live with hacking or don't, live with Big Tech or don't. It's a trade off, but it's our modern world.

Doxing and sharing that information shouldn't be happening, neither should Big Tech information gathering and sharing. Who you are is being sold either way-especially with Big Tech.

Errr...Error....

Military capability extends well beyond a soldier. If you are the greatest football player in the world, and you have a shitty team owner and coach, you might not be winning the championships. 

Now idk if you're trying to tilt this as if I made some slight against individual soldiers? Because I'm a realist, and I'm aware of reality. American Soldiers at least residually are some of the best, we recruit a weighted amount of people who are particularly interested in military related things. We have some great marksman due to our gun/hunting culture. Our revolutionary War mentality, patriotism and the general belief that we are bringing goodness to the world fighting Nazi Zombies makes our troops some of the most dedicated. 

We contrast in battles where other armies will run, we will fight to the last man comparatively. Deidcation, skill, money etc, are some of the best. 

In a world where corruption reigns Supreme we have massive logistical and fraud, waste and abuse issues. However, those are mostly less bad than the rest of the world. Or at the least, we throw enough money at it, to exceed past others. (If we waste 20% of $100, so does everyone else, but then we just throw $75 more at it, and then waste $56 of that). 

But that isn't intrinsically what wins wars. No one is scared the taliban or Vietnamese folks are going to conquer America tomorrow lol. 

We steam roll in wars for a moment, due to our general superiority in tech, training, and particularly air power. 

But that's great for battles. We don't win WARS. And wars have nothing to do with soldiers, battles do. Wars are won by the team owners and the coaches, and ours are just as shitty as any other, or worse. 

It's like when people say ""The Russian government sucks, but not the Russian People"" type things right? Well, no matter what the small percentage of hardcore American patriots might do or be able to do, their owners, their rulers, don't operate the same way. 

In the end, this means, we lose wars, even if we win every battle, we lose the war. 

And again, soldiers win battles, owners win wars. 

I mean who is the head coach if the US team right now? We've literally got a wandering dementia patient roaming the streets. 

You can be Steve Rogers and it doesn't fucking matter how many times you punch Hitler in the face, you're going home eventually to find out we lost the war. It is, what it is. 

Nothing in my post claimed Russia had a better military, or that they would flay the US, or any such nonsense. Putin himself has even said that Russia cannot defeat NATO let alone the US in the straight up sense of war. 

Actually that's a mark of distinction between the crazy levels of world leaders. NK, Iran etc they'll talk mad shit like they can mount some invasion if they had to, and it's a fucking joke. 

The only two ""evil crazy"" world leaders I've seen speak logic and reality in that sense was Assad a while back when asked what he would do to America he said ""Hope they don't attack because we can't do shit to them"". And Putin who has said ""I can't fight NATO, except for nukes"". Which is just facts. 

But if our typical leadership of war fighting were to be at play when we go into a Russia, we will have many many Americans die, and in the end, for nothing. Like Veitnam, like Afghanistan etc. 

So maybe you as your appeal to your soldier status, want to die for no reason? But it's a betrayl of everything we as Americans are supposed to be and stand for. To send our people as Canon fodder to die fighting with gusto just to be set aside for no real purpose. 

That's a fucking corrupt as tragedy. And if you believe in that, you're not an American Soldier. You're a politician. You should be angry, ashamed, saddend by the complete failure of the ruling elite of the US and the tragic deaths of those who fought honorably with the belief that their battles would win a war that no one really cared about winning above them. 

Only a politican would defend that. Or maybe someone beyond delusional who doesn't emotionally want to face reality. And I get it man... I wanna be 15 again, I wanna think that America is running around beating up Nazi Zombie Terrorists while riding an eagle and bringing tidings of comfort and joy to the oppressed and needy....

&gt; Moskva, the flagship of Russia&amp;#039;s Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when &amp;quot;Stormy seas&amp;quot; caused it to sink, according to a ministry message.

&gt; Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew.

&gt; On the first day of Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal.

Ukraine armed forces claim it was struck by 2 anti-ship Neptune missiles, but Russia claims there was an accident that caused a fire and an ammunition explosion. I personally believe that the Ukraine story is more likely but I also wanted to verify it was physcially possible before believing it.   
   
Russia news media confirming the sinking on twitter - Note its in Russian you'll have to right click and then choose ""Translate to English"" (at that's how it works in Chrome)  
https://twitter.com/rianru/status/1514693645185818630?s=21&amp;t=SlMFSnY\_BOFkqWVu4T3wTg  
The Ukraine claim is they sacrificed a TB2 Bayraktar attack drone to distract the ships defenses and then hit the ship with the 2 Ukrainian designed and built Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from shore.   
Neptune Anti-Ship Missile has a listed range between 175 and 190 miles. (varies due to source) and is a land-based system.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360\_Neptune  
Sevastopol (the port for Russia's Black Sea Fleet) where Moskva left from a few days ago is approximetely 164 miles from Dmytrivka (the nearest point of safely Ukraine controlled terriroty to Sevastopol. (I'm not saying the Neptunes were in Dmytrivka - just showing that Moskva is known to be in an area that is within the range of the Neptune system. If Moskva had sailed North, Northwest or West it would have been in range of multiple locations along the coast including Odesa.  
The claim that Ukraine distracted the ship with a TB2 Bayraktar attack drone also verifies as possible.  
Flight Range is 3600 miles, communication control range is 190 miles.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar\_Bayraktar\_TB2  
  
At the very least - we can say the Ukraine claim is possible. Unless Ukraine or Russia releases evidence to support or refut the claims its probably impossible to prove one is true over the other.   
  
Note: This is supposedly one of the ships that was told to ""Warship F\* off"" during the opening days of the war by Ukraine defenders on Snake Island.

I'm going to address the last line first: we should remember this when we claim a moral high ground.... 

Secondly, as to the modern army thing.... we have only fought ""pathetic"" armies for most of the last century and we haven't won.... 

So, While the Russian army is clearly a little bit disappointing, propaganda is real. See, we are mostly only covering their losses and any potential collateral damage. On the other hand, we here cover our successes and our enemies collateral damages. 

But the results have been that we might have kind of won in Iraq? Around now-ish after almost 10 years. 

We lost Afghanistan, we lost Vietnam, we tied in Korea.

Oh, we won in Grendada. Heart Break Ridge, good movie. Basically other than Grendada if you remove propaganda we statistically suck. 

So I'm not even sure this is a ""Russia"" thing, it seems everyone sucks anymore. But do you really think we're just going to go into Russia and ""win""? Other than them just not feeling like fighting, we don't know about winning. We aren't Charlie Sheen lol. 

Russia isn't going to win either against us. 

So really, no body wins. We could just agree to never let Ukraine into NATO, and basically the war ends. Then everybody wins, except various politicians stock market plans.... so we ain't going to do that now are we?",cb3c01232ab1af3c684a8bab77bfc7915c48a15a,True,False,,,,,0,1649974284,,0,{},i4rauj8,False,t3_u1vid9,False,False,t1_i4f7d3k,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u1vid9/russia_is_no_longer_able_to_construct_modern/i4rauj8/,1649974296,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649945484.0,
