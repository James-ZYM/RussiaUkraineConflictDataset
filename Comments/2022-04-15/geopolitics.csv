It's called international private law. The commercial version of international public law (which I specialize in but I had to take some Intl private law courses to graduate)

&gt;What is the highest court in that legal system and who enforces it?

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes or other such forums in Singapore or Paris or other places enforces it. In fact, since we're discussing Sri Lanka, fun fact: Sri Lanka is the first country against which a foreign investor has had recourse to international arbitration based on the dispute settlement clause in a bilateral investment treaty.

When Sri Lanka fails to meet one of its legal obligations (as enshrined in the BIT and the specific contract at hand), a private business or indeed the state itself can sue the Sri Lankan state. 

Let's take Japan for example. Japan has had a BIT with Sri Lanka ever since 1982. If Sri Lanka fails to fulfill its legal obligations by telling Japanese investors that they are now lower in the lender hierarchy (i.e. the order in which lenders are repaid), then Japan or the investors will take Sri Lanka to court and Sri Lanka is forced to pay. Because it involves investment and trade, Sri Lanka is highly incentivized to follow the settlement unless it wants FDI to drastically decrease (what kind of company wants to invest in a small country that won't follow the BIT they signed?) and Japan and its allies can, if they want, impose massive penalties upon Sri Lankan companies in response.

Because it involves business, the enforcement mechanism is unusually strict which has lead to a lot of controversy as some scholars consider this mechanism as a violation of sovereignty. But that's beyond what we're discussing, just thought I'd add that in if you're interested in learning more.",bdf1ef0e5f1007419b6e2ac9a09f67481f2d3ed8,True,False,,,,,0,1650054717,,0,{},i4vjw9j,False,t3_u2tyc7,False,True,t1_i4vb9ea,/r/geopolitics/comments/u2tyc7/what_happens_to_sri_lanka_or_any_country_when/i4vjw9j/,1650054734,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650025917.0

You're going into some other territory and not addressing my points but I'll address it anyway.

&gt;The AidData dataset shows hidden debt to China in Sri Lanka (pdf, see p. 158).

I stated that AidData found little hidden debt to Sri Lanka. Referring to pg 164, Sri Lanka has 0.4% hidden debt exposure to Chinese hidden debt. This only supports my point.

&gt;The problem with Chinese investment there is the same as it is anywhere else in that it is relatively high interest debt (3-6 percent against the 1-3 percent offered by the World Bank and IMF) 

That's quite normal. In layman's terms, they're loaning primarily to countries with worse credit scores and so to compensate for a higher risk profile, they provide higher interest rates.

IMF is the lender of last-resort so of course they have lower interest rates. World Bank is not lender of last-resort but their interest rates are higher than simply 1-3% (3-6% according to their website).

&gt;for garbage chabuduo projects

I don't think you know what chabuduo means. You keep throwing that term around but it doesn't make sense in this context.

I'm guessing you're critiquing the quality of the project. However, studies have shown that Chinese infrastructure projects don't differ that much from projects constructed from OECD countries.

""Both groups of contractors have average scores between ""moderately satisfactory"" and ""satisfactory"". Additionally, reports on only two out of 72 Chinese contracts mentioned the environmental and social problems commonly attributed to Chinese firms.""

https://www.chinafile.com/china-africa-project/chinas-undeserved-reputation-building-bad-infrastructure-africa
https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9364%282009%29135%3A2%28108%29

Sure, some projects aren't done as well but I'm sure you understand how pointing to a minority and generalizing that to the broader group is a logical fallacy.

&gt;that only serve to enrich Chinese contractors and operators at the expense of local people, whose corrupt leaders were bribed by Chinese:

It is bad that they lobbied corrupt officials in order to get the contract. But again, you're portraying this behavior as if it's unique to Chinese contracting firms when it's not. I mean, just look at SNC-Lavalin. 

Again, I'm not defending them, I'm simply saying that the evidence says that Chinese firms are not significantly worse than alternatives.

&gt;Hambantota’s light port traffic and low returns on investment were already noted above.

As was noted in previous sources,...

""In Hambantota, instead of waiting for phase 1 of the port to generate revenue as the Ramboll team had recommended, Mahinda Rajapaksa pushed ahead with phase 2, transforming Hambantota into a container port. In 2012, Sri Lanka borrowed another $757 million from China Eximbank, this time at a reduced, post-financial-crisis interest rate of 2 percent.""

There were two previous feasibility studies done before the construction, both by Western firms, that confirmed the economic feasibility of the port, if it was launched according to the proposals laid out in the feasibility studies. Rajapaksa refused to follow that plan and so it is unprofitable. It's not as if it was unprofitable from the beginning.

&gt;intended to enrich the Chinese construction sector and help keep the Chinese economy afloat

I'm sure it's intended to enrich Chinese constructors just like how any infrastructure project a company, say SNC-Lavalin, carries out will be done for the purpose of enriching them. This is what capitalism looks like.

But it's a mistake that you think this project was meant to help keep the Chinese economy afloat. Just compare what the Chinese economy is, the size of the construction industry domestically in China, and this project to see that even without it, the construction industry and economy would have been fine.

&gt;You seem to want to lawyer this as with other topics and try to separate every minute aspect of a topic from the larger picture, but that is not the way regular people and local people in these developing countries are going to look at it, just like in the Solomons.

That's a fair critique but I think their view has been tainted with misinformation on both sides. China is admitting they and their constructors are doing absolutely nothing wrong, which isn't correct. But at the same time, it's inaccurate to draw the debt-trap diplomacy narrative as the NYT and other outlets did and pretend like Chinese infrastructure firms are behaving in a manner uniquely worse than other infrastructure firms operating in a developing country.

It's especially wrong to use false information to stir-up hate and violence against people of Chinese ethnicity (as you've endorsed in past comments in other subs).

As AidData puts it...

""Is Beijing’s lending program under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) motivated by a desire to seize strategic assets like seaports, airports, and electricity grids? Certainly not. At the same time, no one should harbor any illusions that Chinese state-owned lenders are looking out for anyone’s interests other than their own. Our analysis of the terms and conditions in the contract does not support the allegation that Beijing engages in predatory lending. We instead find that Beijing is a shrewd negotiator who is willing to impose intrusive conditions upon sovereign borrowers to protect its own balance sheet...Borrowing institutions are ultimately responsible for doing their own due diligence and negotiating contractual terms and conditions they consider to be reasonable and acceptable.""

As Brookings puts it...

""American officials have criticized the program as “debt trap diplomacy.”  This fear seems exaggerated.   Most of the countries borrowing from China also borrow from Western donors, the multilateral banks, and private bond holders.  They have diversified sources of finance, and there is no reason to think that they are particularly beholden to China.  The exceptions would be the pariah states, and in developing a strategy for dealing with Venezuela or Iran it is important to take into account China’s investments and interests there.""

No, as women get more educated and are more urbanized they'll naturally want less children and more independence. Feminism in China is everywhere on social media in China right now and bubbling just underneath the wave of nationalism that is super men oriented.

An underestimated aspect of China's extreme turn to nationalism recently is creating and perpetuating a generation of single and lonely men, exacerbating China's demographics, and ultimately depopulating China.

Men are much more likely to turn to nationalism as a source of pride when lacking in opportunities, a phenomenon that generally does not apply to women, who's personalities simply don't find nationalism that appealing. This has been studied in numerous societies.

While Western countries have issues with nationalism themselves, including white nationalism, it differs from China in distinct ways. As a result of having multiple parties and more open societies, nationalists have other groups to keep them in check, and are often minorities in their societies (see cancel culture). Ideas and rhetoric are constantly being challenged. China on the other hand, nationalists would be considered mainstream and have no one to challenge their ideas besides ""foreign ideas"" by design, which are used as further rhetoric to increase nationalism. Secondly, China's nationalism is in hand in its attempts to reign in ""western feminism"" in ways to ensure it doesn't undermine the CCP. Despite this, the trends and ideas of the west will continue to permeate even in China. See the bubbling #metoo movements in Korea with its idols and China itself with Peng Shuai. The CCP simply won't have the self-critical ability to regulate its own policies and will continue to sweep inconvenient social issues under the rug. A major way this issue is manifesting in is with the calls from the CCP and government policies to attempt to increase its fertility rate. Annabelle Chapman explains it better than I can:

The problem with this rhetoric is that it frames the decision to have children in terms of national survival, rather than women’s rights, choices, and aspirations. At worst, it reduces women to vessels for producing the next generation. Women who have at least four children are “rewarded” for their heroic efforts—with the tax exemption in Hungary and a state pension in Poland. Meanwhile, there is a lack of serious discussion about men’s responsibilities as fathers or, indeed, how the government could help citizens combine fruitful careers with their roles as parents.

You can see the backlash to government rhetoric for increased marriages and raising children on Chinese social media. These issues will continue to bubble and cause social tension as women grow more ambitious and men become more nationalistic where their interests become directly at odds. Women becoming more career oriented and men becoming more lonely and less valuable as partners.

China's refusal to confront its gender issues are also manifested in its gender imbalance, which its own health authorities have described as ""the most serious and prolonged"" in the world because of the country's old one-child policy. It's generally a bad idea to have half of your population feeling constrained and feeling like second class citizens, while seeing the other half becoming less valuable marriage partners.

This creates a perpetual cycle of increasingly lonely men who turn to nationalism with limited opportunities and partners as women simply do not prioritize nationalism and find many of its subsequent symptoms distasteful (see western incels as well who tend to turn to white nationalism as a source of purpose and value). In other words, bitter wumao keyboard warriors provide no value to raising a family and are not characteristics for attractive partners. Ranting about national pride, pettily engaging in every perceived sleight against China, and and being a wolf warrior as an identity has little pragmatic value for women.

This is why despite increasing the birth limits, China's population continues to fall at a faster rate than any other country in human history. Just 12 million babies were born last year, an 18% plunge from 14.65 million in 2019. The CCP in its almighty wisdom has overlooked a crucial element in stoking nationalism: the personality effects it has on men and women.

Ironically, the CCP stoking extreme Chinese nationalism among the population is making the population and China disappear.",e435f89dfec33d411e27eb00e6049e27b96a6790,True,False,,,,,0,1650037078,,0,{},i4ud5x1,False,t3_u3ksj6,False,True,t3_u3ksj6,/r/geopolitics/comments/u3ksj6/china_will_inevitably_rise_to_global_hegemony/i4ud5x1/,1650037094,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650008278.0

I think you mean it indicates that it **was** viewed as useful to whoever decided to build it. Sometimes countries decision makers don't make decisions that are in the interest of their country but instead they make mistaken decisions or make them because they are in the interest of some special interest (which could even be themselves). 

&gt;Also the Hambantota port isn't part of BRI

I don't know the details of the port, but according to this report on the BRI in Sri Lanka it is part of the BRI. It and the areas around have been being developed well after 2013. Ok maybe some initial port existed in 2010. Not sure where you get all your information, but this was the first thing that showed up for me when I googled.

https://archivos.juridicas.unam.mx/www/bjv/libros/12/5550/19.pdf

The report also says that the PRC is by far the largest loaner to Sri Lanka. (At least in 2016 and it has probably gone up). Also Sri Lanka imports the most from the PRC and about 20 times what it exports (again 2016 numbers and probably worse now). So it seem like their debt problems have a lot to do with the PRC.

I'm still asking the same question. 

How does this make it good for commercial purposes but bad for military purposes (unless you are actually at war with a country that can easily strike your base in which case you probably don't want your ships in base anyways).

1) As has been shown in the last few decades Media can bias a jury FAR MORE then in the time of the constitutions. Good examples of this include the ""Boston bomber"" trial where petitions to have the location of the trial moved were denied SPECIFICALLY because an unbiased jury would be impossible to find (a situation that had it happened outside the US resolved by using judges as the jury) and the Australian trial of Cardinal Pell where the higher court judges threw out the guilty sentence because the jury had chosen to go with their media induced bias over exculpatory evidence.

2)Of their peers becomes...complicated with the ICC.

Should a US citizen face a jury ONLY of US citizens or should it be a mix of nationalities or should it be a mix of both the accuseds nationality and the victims nationality?. If you choose a random mix should random African farmers be flown to Europe if they are selected? How do you even randomly sample the world population without biasing the court in favour of first and second world nations?

And if you choose a mix of the nationalities of the victims and the defendants how do they even communicate.

If a US citizen is before the ICC for warcrimes in Afghanistan and the jury is a mix of Afghans and US citizens, how do you facilitate communication WITHOUT violating the sanctity of the jury room. Especially since some words don't have an exact translation.

Simply put...trial by jury at the ICC would LIKELY limit the jury to those who speak English (as the current Lingua franca) which would bias the court to be EVEN MORE pro western, pro-wealthy, pro-upper class then it already is.

In 2017 Russia attempted to kill Sergei Skirpal with a nerve agent in Salisbury and ended up killing a British civilian and hospitalising several, including a police officer. Russia has also probably assassinated several other people on British soil, including a GCHQ agent who was found in a sports bag.

A Chatham House research paper on Chinese investment in Sri Lanka acknowledges the difficulty in quantifying it but comes up with the figure [$12.1 billion between 2006 and July 2019 or equivalent to 14 per cent of Sri Lanka’s 2018 GDP](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/03/chinese-investment-and-bri-sri-lanka-0/2-economy), giving Chinese lenders the largest bilateral share of Sri Lankan debt, behind the Asian Development Bank.

The problem with Chinese investment there is the same as it is anywhere else in that it is relatively high interest debt (3-6 percent against the 1-3 percent offered by the World Bank and IMF) for garbage chabuduo projects that only serve to enrich Chinese contractors and operators at the expense of local people, [whose corrupt leaders were bribed by Chinese](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Belt-and-Road/China-s-control-over-Sri-Lankan-infrastructure-reignites-fears):

&gt;Even today, [few appear economically viable, let alone profitable](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566ef8b4d8af107232d5358a/t/5ad5e20ef950b777a94b55c3/1523966489456/Harbored+Ambitions.pdf) (pdf). Hambantota’s light port traffic and low returns on investment were already noted above. Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport allegedly receives just seven passengers a day and is labeled by critics as the “world’s emptiest airport.” Additionally, China Communication Construction Company began demanding 143 million USD in compensation for losses sustained from their stalled Colombo Port City contract.

And that port city is nothing more than a [$15 billion (at least) boondoggle](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59993386) intended to enrich the Chinese construction sector and help keep the Chinese economy afloat, as construction accounts for a full quarter of the Chinese economy, when they are working. This is the largest single foreign investment in the island nation's history.

You seem to want to lawyer this as with other topics and try to separate every minute aspect of a topic from the larger picture, but that is not the way regular people and local people in these developing countries are going to look at it, just like in the Solomons. Their nation is in a crisis and there is no disputing the fact that their corrupt leaders, [who were put into office by the Chinese](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html), got them there by taking on these loans for snake oil projects that enrich Chinese and not locals, with the added benefit of putting the local government on the hook for collateral on the loans to Chinese. I don't know how you can sit there and defend the massive swindle that this is.

Russia will default and lose, Ukraine will win. The west I'll be a bit more cohesive but not overwhelmingly so after the war is over and of course enlightenment won't be achieved and we will continue to have serious but not fatal problems as before.


&gt; But there's a gloomy feeling that I'm not seeing expressed much either in articles (and I'm talking FP, FA, and things like WaPo, not just CNN or the like) and especially not in the comments on Reddit. But...

&gt; I have a feeling the West may have seriously harmed its future power. By releasing such monumental sanctions, I don't see how the majority of the world continues to invest in reserves or use the petrodollar as before. It's going to look way too risky for them.

The petrodollar is a silly conspiracy theory based on a misunderstanding of global trade and currency. The dollar isn't the reserve currency because oil is traded in it, oil is traded in it because it's the reserve currency. Almost all international trade outside the EU is done in dollars because they are useful for buying/paying from other countries. The US dollar got it's status because

&gt; Another worry: I see a social trend of how the people of Rus should all collectively ""suffer"" economically since Ukrainians are. Of course, Rus is way less financially secure than the US or EU, so sanctions are easier to add whereas these types of sanctions on the West would either be impossible or incredibly detrimental for another country to impose. But I'm seeing a strange cultural shift in how war is perceived, and politically on how to combat it, that I think is due to this being a truly ""online"" war and also in a European country. 

The point of sanctions is to stop the war and undermine the governments strength not as cosmic punishment.  Also side point that people of Rus isn't a good abbreviation for Russua because Kyiv and Ukraine are also descendants of the Rus(Kievan Rus being the first east slavic state)

&gt; Final thing: the most likely ending to this conflict is a signed treaty, but what is the political will of those in the West to even facilitate it? Likely it would invovle a Ukrainian and presumably worldwide recognition of Crimea (and the removal of those sanctions plus new ones,) but I can't see how Biden or really any major Western power would want that. Even if Zelensky agrees or promotes the idea, it would politically kneecap any Western politician to ""appease"" since so many people seem to think Ukraine can hold on forever and reclaim everything they want. But these ideas are not based in reality, yet they seem to be the current mentality of a lot of people. I don't know how politicians will reckon with the reality of an agreement that's not perfect with voters who are hyped on a video game style victory. The removal of sanctions alone could be unfathomable for voters, but then how would an agreement ever be reached without that major carrot?

Zelensky is more popular then most politicians in western countries. I think his difficulty would be in selling any deal to Ukranians. The west would have to accept it and I think most would agree to drop sanctions as a carrot. The biggest stumbling block though is likely to be Putin recognizing that he's lost and coming to reasonable terms Ukraine can agree to",7efa0b123720e1eb6de1561ab1012b6dbeb735d3,True,False,,,,,0,1649997182,,0,{},i4smf3m,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i1v3y12,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i4smf3m/,1649997197,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649968382.0

[],False,,MauritanianHistory,,,[],,,,text,t2_3g8sklbz,False,False,"&gt;Why do you assume that Russia and China are acting out of their core geopolitical interests and the West is acting out of some foolish moralist/ideological imperative?

That's a great question, and I think (and there are many theories about this) that it comes down to the competitive nature of international relations and how particular configurations affect behavior. Russia and China, as second-rate powers, are constrained by their inability to assert themselves in the face of the U.S and so are stuck fighting for marginal gains or security issues they feel they cannot compromise on (like Ukraine for Russia). The United States, as a unipolar power after the Cold War, faced no such constraint. The U.S is remarkably secure, with an entire hemisphere to itself and no regional competitors, control of Europe and the Pacific. The security cost of pursuing ideological strategies and goals was so minimal as to not pose a sufficient constraint - ""democratization"" schemes, regime change, and so on. In short, states act in a realist fashion because the international system is anarchic and competitive - once they don't have to compete, it is entirely possible that they will lose sight of the primordial fact. I think such a lens explains well the sort of decline in diplomatic deftness now being recognized in the pages of American think tanks and newspapers, and the sacrifice of U.S prestige in order to reinforce a delusional ""rules-based order"" that was really meant to be a U.S global order - for example, U.S policy on China up until Xi came into office, which treated it not as a potential rival but as a potential partner, allowing it to become a great power with little hindrance that can now make credible demands in its backyard.

&gt;To answer your question, yes. NATO expansion into the Baltics and former Warsaw Pact countries does stop Russia from acting aggressively towards those NATO members.

Russia has still acted aggressively towards them, just not militarily - yet. But that could be quite different if they had been told ""no"" when it came to NATO application, and instead now stood as EU members with bilateral relations with Russia, as Ukraine tried to be under Yanukovych. Not the best of all worlds for them, but for the rest of the world it's better than NATO and Russia sitting and planning how a WWIII would be fought in the Baltics.

&gt; You claimed that appeasement may have been a way for Britain and France to rearm and get prepared for future conflict, and I disagreed saying that the Allies relative combined strength was probably higher in 1936 and 1938 then 1939.

This is an empirical question and I've read historians that come down on either side. But my point is that even if that were true, the British and French had no real way of knowing the extent of Hitler's ambitions in those years, and that they did appease Hitler by taking a ""promise of peace"" from him rather than serious concessions or mechanisms to prevent further German expansion. I'm not advocating for charity towards Russia, I'm advocating a mutually beneficial way of ensuring peace between NATO and Russia, even if it isn't advantageous to the Baltic states or Ukraine or Georgia.

&gt; I don't buy the argument that NATO expansion caused Russian aggression, on the contrary, NATO membership prevents Russian aggression. The US and NATO have no desire for Barbarossa 2.0, the concept is ridiculous in a environment with nuclear weapons.

Russia's main fear isn't Barbarossa 2.0. 

&gt;What NATO does do however is threaten Putins ability to threaten, intimidate, and use military force on his neighbors without consequence.

Actually it also threatens Putin's ability to conduct diplomacy, trade or espionage there too, and puts Pentagon operatives there to conduct anti-Russian diplomacy, trade and espionage.

&gt; NATO and the West also offer a far more attractive economic and political alternative to the Russian model.

This is true, and its the main reason for why NATO was welcomed with open arms in many places - including Balkan states - who really had nothing to fear from Russia following the fall of the USSR and didn't hasten to join NATO like the Baltic states, who were in a more precarious position, did.

&gt; Russia is a declining Great Power attempting to masquerade as a Superpower based solely on its nuclear arsenal and the decaying prestige of the former Soviet Union.

That's certainly the way it seemed in the 90s and early 2000s, until Russia began to rearm in the 2010s and assert itself more globally (like in Syria). No one wanted to pick the losing side of the Cold War after the Russians themselves lost faith in communism. I think that's one argument *against* the view that it was all driven by fear of Russian aggression.

&gt;why did most former Warsaw Pact countries and former Soviet states pursue NATO membership and not a more comfortable/appeasing membership with the CSTO/CIS?

NATO membership and EU membership basically go hand-in-hand. Both institutions reinforce each other greatly, and admittance to NATO can be a path to admittance into the EU. If you read Henrik Larsen, you'll see that there are quite a lot of complex and overlapping economic and political incentives involved in joining both, plus there is an important ideological component - part of NATO and EU expansion is getting nations to reform themselves in the West's image as a precondition to join the rich kids club, and what this does is essentially give citizens in these nations a stake in maintaining NATO and the EU. CTSO/CIS is the wish.com version of the EU, it may be more comfortable for certain corrupt leaders who like things a certain way, but the democratic opposition that arose in the late Soviet era (with heavy Western backing btw) came back with a vengeance when the USSR fell. Bill Clinton actually mentions this in the Atlantic article published the other day.

&gt;Any power bold enough to openly invade a NATO country is a threat to the whole of Europe and would demand a military response from NATO and the US.

I don't really buy that the military leaders in the Pentagon and Bundeswehr believe that any nation willing to attack Montenegro is about to march on Warsaw or even Prague.

&gt;Article 5 is the foundation of the security of the Western world and the liberal world order. 

The foundation of the security of the ""Western world"" and the ""liberal world order"" relies on the United States, a nation that would still be wealthy and secure if it said ta-ta and retreated West to the entire half of the planet earth that is firmly in its grasp, instead of turning the entire northern hemisphere into the video game Fallout to preserve the territorial integrity of foreign nations. If you think that Trump's NATO-skepticism was an aberrant flash-in-the-pan, and not a position that has serious traction among a minor but still relevant segment of America's political and military class, you're wrong.",fef1136f7b5ba3f6df97ee7c688f30f5ede20547,True,False,,,,,0,1649985283,,0,{},i4rz3qe,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i4rl9l6,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4rz3qe/,1649985300,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649956483.0
