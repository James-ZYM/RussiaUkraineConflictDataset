It’s common sure, but assuming the Russian hulls are all RHA isn’t an assumption I would want to make. Assuming that the Soviet RHA hulls were all made to spec, I’d also not what I would consider a safe bet. You should read up on it. 

&gt;	At the side and the rear? Sure. I guess you could knock out the engine or 

The armor almost everywhere on every tank, the Leopard, the Abrams, the T90 etc, is not at all heavily armored. The hulls are known to be susceptible to penetration and even HE is going to get through, and it’s not going to take 10,000 rounds either. I wouldn’t want to be in the crew compartment while an IFV puts 25 or 30mm on the side hull next to where my legs are. 

&gt;	What’s a moderate amount of HE? And what is the precision of a 30 mm autocannon? 

Say, 300 rounds. The precision is incredibly precise and especially so at short range. At long range with known distance, I’ve seen great hits during stress shoots. The range in OP feels close to zeroing range. 

&gt;	Is it actually realistic to hit the same spot over and over again? 

In short, yes. Especially when the standard is ‘close enough together to cause armor degradation.’ OP looks to be less than point blank range. 

&gt;	High explosive rounds explode on the surface of a target, and with armour as thick as an mbt, 

The HE will chip away at the armor. It will work on cracking the steel. The armor on an MBT hull is not terribly thick, not on a single hull on earth. WWII levels of armor (or worse) is common for a hull and easily defeated by all sorts of modern systems. The hull has always been the weak spot and your officers just failed to mention that the reason you were training to fire from a tiered fighting position, is because you’ve got to hide your hull behind all that dirt.",d5f06b73670d5184c1744ffa2eb43f65a3da6656,True,False,,,,,0,1650037042,,0,{},i4ud2nz,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4u85ib,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4ud2nz/,1650037056,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650008242.0,

Just some examples:
- Russians killing Ukrainians in actual footage by camera or drone = OK (plenty of videos)

- Russians showing aftermath = deleted/reported (the tank that killed 20+ guys)

- Ukrainians showing aftermath = upvoted to hot (literally anything)

South Vietnam literally caused the war themselves, Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to take part in 1956 reunification elections agreed upon at the 1954 Geneva Conference was the entire reason why the communist insurgency that coalesced into the VC began. 

*""In such a dire situation, the US support of the fledgling democracy in the South needed to be as ruthless as their pitiless Communist adversaries.""* 

South Vietnam's first president came to power via rigged elections (Diem won more votes than there were actual voters). In fact, the opposition was the last emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, who Diem supported previously. Bao Dai (emperor) was not allowed to campaign, so Diem was guaranteed to become president.

South Vietnam's first president immediately became authoritative. He persecuted Buddhists and political dissidents and Rummel (1997) estimates that 16,000 - 167,000 civilians were killed be Diems regime alone. The US government gave the greenlight for his removal / assassination in 1963 (Cable 243) after the 1963 Buddhist Pagoda raids.

1. Diem's regime survives first coup in 1960
2. Diem was assassinated in a coup by Duong Van Minh and replaced by a military Junta in 1963.
3. Doung Van Minh's Junta was ousted in a coup led by Nguyen Khanh in Jan 1964. Minh's Junta was replaced by Khanh's Junta.
4. Nguyen Khanh sets up the High National Council (civilian advisory body) under heavy US pressure to give a semblance of civilian rule in South Vietnam. Khanh appointed Duong Van Minh, the man he literally just ousted as one of the leading members along with Tran Thien Khiem. Khanh allows Minh to pick the members and Minh picks 17 civilian members who side with Minh.
5. Tran Thien Khiem (The other leading member of the HNC that Khanh selected), then launches a coup on Khanh, which fails.\\
6. Khanh then dissolves the HNC 3 months after setting it up, pissing off the Americans.
7. Another coup is launched on Khanh in Feb 1965 to put the same Tran Thien Khiem from above, into power. It fails! And then funnily enough, a third party, led by Nguyen Cao Ky, who disliked both sides of the coup, just went ahead and ousted Khanh themselves and took power. And yes you guessed it, formed another military junta.
8. The US is getting sick and tired of their shit at this point and forces South Vietnam to hold presidential elections in 1967 (Diem was the last president).
9. Nguyen Cao Ky (the third party who luckily took power in the chaos of the last coup), plans to run, but is convinced by Nguyen Van Thieu to drop out and run as Thieu's running mate and later Vice President. He agrees, Van Thieu wins and then Cao Ky is immediately sidelined and given no power (lol).
10. Van Thieu, in classic south vietnamese style, goes full corruption mode. He actually gains such a reputation that in 1971 when he went for re-election, he automatically won because no one wanted to run against him as they believed he would falsify any results in his favour. 
11. Van Thieu resigns 9 days before South Vietnam's fall. In his famous words ""I resign, but I do not desert"".
12. Van Thieu flees Vietnam 5 days later to Taiwan
13. To complete the circle, Duong Van Minh, who led the first coup against Diem, becomes President of South Vietnam.... for 2 days, and then hands the country over to North Vietnam

10/10 democracy South Vietnam.

*""In addition, the former colonial overlord and regional hegemon had 300K troops based in North Vietnam.""*

Okay? And just prior to this, the previous colonial overlord had just waged war in Vietnam for 9 years to reconquer Vietnam with indirect and direct US assistance and involvement (US was directly involved at Dien Bien Phu, and two pilots were KIA). Oh and just prior to this, the US was in favour of Vietnamese independence and directly objected to any French attempts at going back to Vietnam. In fact the US was constantly butting heads with the British and French over Indochina, as the US viewed British operations in Indochina as a means to pave the wave for a later French return.

*"" that Indo-China should not go back to France but that it should be administered by an international trusteeship. France has had the country—thirty million inhabitants for nearly one hundred years, and the people are worse off than they were at the beginning... but the case of Indo-China is perfectly clear. France has milked it for one hundred years. The people of Indo-China are entitled to something better than that.* **- Roosevelt's memo to Cordell Hull Jan 24th 1944.**  


*""In favor of anything that is against the Japanese in Indochina provided that we do not align ourselves with the French""* \- **President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Indochina at the Yalta Conference 1945.**

*""Roosevelt said that he wanted to discontinue colonization in the SEA area and that he was determined that there would be no military assistance to the French in Indochina""* \- **Lt.Gen Wedemeyer on instructions from Roosevelt regarding the Japanese coup in Vietnam.**

""*He saw no evidence that the Viet Minh were communistic and though that their sole purpose was independence""* \- **Maj. Allison K. Thomas, part of OSS Deer team who dropped into North Vietnam to assist the Viet Minh, on his opinion regarding the Viet Minh. Thomas would later go on to march with the Viet Minh into Hanoi (can be seen in photos during the march).**

*""Lord Mountbatten is using the American lend-lease supplies and other American resources to invade Indo-China to defeat what we believe to be the American policy and to re-establish French imperialism""  -* **Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley on British support to French in Indochina**

Less than two weeks prior to the commencement of Operation Masterdom (British/Japanese/French joint operation to remove Viet Minh from Saigon), Lt. Col. Archimedes Patti was in Vietnam to oversee the transfer of allied POW's. In his 1981 interview, he recounts the pleasant conversations he had with Vo Nguyen Giap and Ho Chi Minh and how Giap surprised him outside the villa Patti was staying in with a 50 piece band playing star spangled banner with the flags of the US/UK/Soviets/China and Vietnam flying overhead (Patti can be see in photos saluting the flag next to Vo Nguyen Giap). Patti also assisted Ho Chi Minh in editing the draft declaration of Independence for Vietnam and was present in the crowd during the declaration on 2nd September 1945.

&amp;#x200B;

After the French retook control in the south in a coup on 24/25th of September 1945, Ho Chi Minh sent two desperate letters directly to Truman (archived and available online) begging for US help and intervention to remove the French and prevent war from breaking out). The US remains silent until 1949 when they being supporting the French. This also might sound familiar because Ho Chi Minh did the exact same thing in 1919 when he sent a letter to US secretary of state Robert Lansing asking for US help in giving Vietnam independence but he was ignored (but the letter was archived and is now available online).

&gt; Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN that “there was an explosion” on the Russian cruiser Moskva, but added the United States cannot assess at this point if the ship was hit by a missile.

Russia said its warship ""remains afloat"" after a fire detonated ammunition on board, while Ukrainian officials said the Moskva was hit by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles and has sunk.

“We’re not quite exactly sure what happened here. We do assess that there was an explosion — at least one explosion on this cruiser — a fairly major one at that, that has caused extensive damage to the ship,” Kirby said.  
Kirby said the damaged Russian warship is afloat and ""making her own way across the Black Sea.""

&gt;“We assess that the ship is able to make its own way, and it is doing that; it's heading more towards now we think the east. We think it's probably going to be putting in at Sevastopol for repairs, but we don’t know what exactly caused that,” Kirby added.

You can breach concrete with just about anything, and you will indeed chip it apart as you go along. I've taken down concrete with aforementioned pickaxe before. It is certainly not realistic to do that to any kind of vehicle armour. 

I'd assume most Russian tank armour is RHA and composite materials for the most part, unless they're using some really old gear type the first model t72. 

I think you know just as well as me that tanks have weak spots. Very few at the front though. Perhaps a lucky 30mm ap can go through the turret ring, but perhaps not. I don't actually know the thickness of the armour at that point. I'm quite confident that HE cannot penetrate anywhere.

At the side and the rear? Sure. I guess you could knock out the engine or penetrate the drive sprockets with armour piercing rounds.

What's a moderate amount of HE? And what is the precision of a 30 mm autocannon? Is it actually realistic to hit the same spot over and over again? High explosive rounds explode on the surface of a target, and with armour as thick as an mbt, most of the energy will dissipate outwards and be reflected, leaving relatively little energy to actually effect the armour itself.

Benefits? Roughly the same price, assuming easier to train pilots on, range, and I'm wagering higher speed at lower or similar altitudes the attack helicopters fly would make them harder to hit with MANPADS but obviously not impossible.

Obviously lol.

&gt;You don't need a cook-off to have a tank killed. If you damage as little as its tracks and the crew abandons it, it  becomes a mission kill.

I said that in the first sentence? Those tanks are likely disabled. 

My assumption and assertion is that his claim the btr ""killed"" the tanks, in this context the kill seems to point to them both being destroyed not just removed from action in the clip, seems unlikely given the context of the video. 

The closest tank to the btr especially. The smoke you see is the engine throttling up and the tank drives forward and starts to turn right after taken several 30mm shots to the rear. Then the video ends.

Why end it there? When one tank is obviously operational(driving away), and the status of the other in the 20 seconds in unknown. Likely heavily damaged, especially on its sensors, potentially tracks, and given the right ammo its engine, ect.

Calling these tanks killed is definitely a stretch, and most telling is the video cutting right when the combat is set to peak, either killing the dismounting tankers, or just ending with them obviously disabled. 

I know we are debating over small definitions differences. But I dont think killed is appropriate here without followup video or pictures given how the clip ends with one vehicle clearly moving.

For example, someone fires a LMG into a pickup trucks rear, then it starts driving away and you turn the clip off. Would you mark that up as a kill?",4ee7a06dcdcf72cff6619f68ec92087bba370c5d,True,False,,,,,0,1650033683,,0,{},i4u51w4,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4tf8n2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4u51w4/,1650033700,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650004883.0,

Great. Cite. 

‘Last I remember’ and ‘I believe’ aren’t sufficient to back up your claims of ‘we have proof.’  Anyway, I’m thinking the data you remember doesn’t make the point you think it makes. I know Javs go through T90’s like a hot knife. 

You were trying to say the T90 has a great APS system, even though that system doesn’t even pretend to work against a Jav. 

You were trying to say that the ERA stops a Jav. 1) You’ve yet to show that is the case. 2) You’ve yet to show that even if the ERA protects the crew from a Jav, that the ERA doesn’t help destroy the tank anyway. Or, are you contending that equal and opposite force doesn’t apply? Or, are you contending the force is mitigated in some way? What tamps the ERA on a tank? The armor itself or something else. 

&gt;	One disadvantage of the javelin is how slow it flies, making it easier for systems to identify it. 

What system? How? Be specific. Provide a secondary citation or some raw data. No data set I’ve ever seen backs this up.  No one I’ve seen even claims this, except in some crazy article out of USMA where the author specifically mentioned he had to have help from one of the NCOs with actual experience. 

&gt;	I dont think it is really fair to be calling a lot of these systems Vietnam era tech considering the different generations of each system

And here you show your lack of understanding on the topic. Wire guided, line of sight, horizontal flight ATGMs are Vietnam era tech that are defeated at almost perfect rates by the Trophy APS, and is the exact type of weapon the Russians claim their APS defeats.

Thanks. My point exactly. A point that people can’t seem to understand. But I’m not claiming to know everything, just a few things I’ve learned in combat and in many years as a combat infantryman. 

Have you ever breached with any of the different ammo choices?  If so, what did you find worked in different situations? 25mm training ammo actually does a great job on reinforced concrete. It cracks it into chunks quite well. 

&gt;	Tanks have thick armour as they are among other things expected to engage other tanks.

Everywhere? Or, basically just on the front of the turret, and on the side turret on some tanks?  For the hull, are these Russian tanks all outfitted with RHA or are many cast steel?

&gt;	APCs are expected to engage lighter armoured targets and infantry.

Well, not all APCs, but the IFV part of the family sure is, you are correct. The point is that if an IFV, especially one with a 30mm bangs away at it, they will penetrate most of the armor on a tank in a reasonable amount of time, 

&gt;	Good luck hitting tank armour with 30mm HE enough times to breach it before you are lit up like a birthday candle.

Here is the straw man argument. I never said it was a good idea or tactically ideal, did I? But yup, if you pound with just a moderate amount of HE, you’re going to get through armor most places on a T90, just not everyplace. If you pound with both load outs filled with even training ammo, I bet a penetration will happen. Hit anything, as you already agreed, long enough and you’ll get through. 

That was the only point I was making.",d20084adfdd6b24e29c1f29fa323e202faf6265e,True,False,,,,,0,1650030581,,0,{},i4ty0y5,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4t517f,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4ty0y5/,1650030598,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650001781.0,

They both have a common adversary - the US, but to say they're anything more than surface-level okay with each other is seeing too much in the relation, I think.

If China plays its cards right, they'll economically gain the upper hand over Russia - no need for bullying, but they certainly will gain a better negotiating position economically.

If anything, I think this is an eye-opener for China to just give up on Taiwan. An invasion will certainly not only be very hard because it's an island, but also because they've seen the world *will* sanction it. Unlike Russia, countries are not vitally dependent on China. Companies will take a hit, but it's not like basic necessities are hit. It's a free preview of what might happen if China does invade stuff.

The status quo still to me seems like a decent win for China - mostly on the intel (they know what Russia is (not) capable of and how the world will react) and economical balance side.

Value per soldier: \~$0.1 mln

Moscow missile cruiser: Perhaps around $500 mln plus 500 crew coming to $550 mln

Assumed convoy composition and 50 % losses of crew:

50 % trucks and unarmored transport with average 10 people on board \~$0.6 mln

20 % IFV/APC with average 8 people on board \~$0.9 mln

10 % MBT with average 4 people on board \~$1.2 mln

10 % Artillery with average 4 people on board \~$3.2 mln

10 % specialized with average 5 people on board \~$0.75 mln

So a sunk Moscow missile cruiser is comparable to taking out some \~550 convoy vehicles.

If this convoy had more than 120 vehicles as some claimed, then the answer is: about 4 such convoys.

Another SU34 and a KA-52 where shot down. Other than that i noticed an increase in downed drones lately.

Some smaller stuff like ATGM's and MANPADS still missing and i don't think i'll add them anytime soon just a waste of costly pixels.

Disclaimer: I am no expert on russian military vehicles so those graphics for the vehicles may sometimes be wrong i tried my best to match them as good as possible and change them from time to time.

Only most competent militaries could probably avoid any kind of war crime and eruptions of violence, especially when you are not too successful. I am talking about something like Bucha.

While deaths during air strikes or artillery is a bit another thing. They are mostly accidental as it seems Ukrainian soldiers really do not try to avoid urban combat and very often take positions in populated areas as they provide more cover even if you create extra risk to surrounding population.

&gt;If you started with ""the holocaust is good"" you are just fucked.

But this is no holocaust. It is a tragedy, it is a crime, it is slaughter, but it really doesn't feel like genocide. For that it shouldn't be random it should be coordinated effort.


&gt;The real situation is ""the guys comitting the holocaust are good"" and if you want to listen to why they're actually good you're wasting your time because there is no justification.

Have seen cases of tortured PoWs on Ukrainian side. There are accusations that some civilians suffered from Ukrainian forces too, especially in Donbass. If people really cared about fairness, war crimes then these things wouldn't be skipped. That is the thing, rules do not apply to a single side, however, the same people who demand justice on one side not that rarely ask for executions and death on another.

Hello, this is my dead son, Belchenko Daniil, who was ruthlessly killed by Ilchenko VV with the assistance of RadomyshlskaVarta  
My name is Karina Belchenko, I would like to cover the story of the murder of my child, Daniel Belchenko (12 years old), who was killed in the yard of his own house by representatives of the local group for protection of the population of Radomyshl, Zhytomyr region.  
On March 7, 2022, my son and a neighbor's boy (10 years old) played in the yard of their own house, where we fled from Kyiv after the war in Ukraine. At 4:10 p.m., people in camouflage weapons broke into the yard and started firing on the children without warning. The children were very frightened and ran across the yard to a nearby garden to hide. I was at home with my family at the time. When we heard the shots, we tried to run outside to see what had happened. In front of the door, stood a man with a machine gun and did not let us out of the house to see what happened, citing the fact that they found the saboteurs and shot at them! But they were children !! We started shouting that the children should not shoot, but it was too late! When we were released from the house, Yurko and Ilchenko, who were shooting at children, had already fled the scene. They were detained on the way out of the garden, and substances were found in the car, which later, according to the examination, turned out to be a narcotic substance!  
Now the suspects are in jail, but have already changed their testimony and are appealing for a change of location. I don't know what to do, the murderers want to be acquitted and released!  
My son will not be returned, but if they are released they will continue to be able to kill innocent children! Defendant Ilchenko, who is guilty of my son’s death, has money and connections, so he is behaving very defiantly!",31caed80978a4a5612d5bbdd0d91e81c2b51d1b7,True,False,,,,,0,1650028918,,0,{},i4tulfc,False,t3_u32mt5,False,True,t1_i4ttkuh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32mt5/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41422/i4tulfc/,1650028935,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650000118.0,

And people should remember that this is a space dedicated to essentially what its name calls for, that is, combat footage. Hence, everything that can qualify as a military combat activity being recorded should be presented here indiscriminately, thus assuring that we get to see as much footage of the highest quality notwithstanding its political or moral implications, because it's not in this subreddit's interest to be hindered by such problems. In a way, this sub's eyes ought to be invisible to the broader perspective, and instead only become focused on the combat details.

 But now, due to the vast majority favouring the Ukrainian side, we only get to see the footage that presents an outcome favourable to the dominant bias, and this is frustrating not least because it doesn't help anyone's cause. Why are people so eager to only see the videos in which the Ukrainians win? Do they imagine this will somehow alter the course of the war? It's somehow ridiculous to only tolerate evidence that panders to the general taste.

 It's ridiculous to see people upvoting the Ukrainian footage in the thousands, but at the same time downvoting the Russian one into nonexistence just because they'd rather not see the other team win too.

&gt;Russians commonly use the word khokhol as an ethnic slur for Ukrainians, as it was a common haircut of Ukrainian Cossacks. The term is frequently derogatory or condescending, an equivalent of the Ukrainian term katsap and Polish kacap for Russians. The word comes from Proto-Slavic xoxolъ &lt; \*koxolъ, “crest, tuft.”  
Besides calling Ukrainians khokhly, Russians also refer to Ukraine as Khokhlyandiya (Ukrainian: Хохляндія, Хохландія) and Khokhlostan (Ukrainian: Хохлостан). The word ""Khokhol"" with the meaning of ""unconscious Ukrainian"" refers to the person who renounced their independence, individuality and allegiance to Russia, and instead began using Turkisms (words derived from Turkic languages) that were incorporated into the Ukrainian language.

They don't need false flags before deciding to invade a country. They just do it if they feel like it, the president gives a nice speech and that it's in the US best interests. They don't have to answer to anybody.

The Viet Cong were directly supported by the North who were supplied by the USSR. The North also had hundreds of thousands of PRC personnel deployed in the DRV. Lets not pretend otherwise. It was one superpower and one regional hegemon backing the North who in turn supplied the VC, they were not just simple farmers fighting with sharpened fruit.

And they were largely irrelevant after Tet and the flight of the South Vietnamese population to the cities. There is a reason the North went back to conventional offensives, the VC strategy was not going to work especially after the South's far more successful attempt at land reform.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; bla bla bla US support Viet Minh to librated Viet Nam from Jap nazi, then French want their colony back -&gt; Us decided France is better ally than a far away jungle country -&gt; Turndown letter from Hồ Chí Minh asked for intervention -&gt; Only USSR and China wanna help -&gt; Vietnam become fully communist (before was Viet Minh).

HCM's brutal land reform was fully Maoist in form and practice. Whatever they were during the war, they had embraced the ideology like good little lackeys by the 50s. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because Korea war is Civil war, Vietnam war is a continious from librated war.

Vietnam only took the shape it did at the start of the 19th century, it is younger than even the USA and was originally built off the conquests in the south of the modern country. It is not ethnically homogenous either with the indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands suffering extreme ethnic cleansing both pre and post 1975. Your portrayal of the war as simply being about liberation is hopelessly simplistic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;VietNam still a communist country till today.

My sweet summer child, it is no longer a Communist country and it embraced market oriented reforms in 1986 a mere 11 years after the 'victory' which saw 30 years of struggle for an ideology that was dumped in just over a decade because it doesn't work. Communism is just a facade for a kleptocratic elite as in China.

The last I remember, they had 6 confirmed t90's being destroyed, and I believe 5 of them were done via a javelin system/s (they are much more effective in pairs/groups). I specifically remember a video showing a t90 taking a direct hit (had a turret EPA) and the tank was totally fine. It is a very effective system against pretty much all heavy vehicles, but it still has weak points that can be used to a defenders advantage.

It's so interesting if you go on JSOCarchive you learn so much about the politics of special forces. SEALs it's like an old boys club they cover up and back their own, but like CAG( Delta) you  have to meet the standard or you will turn up and your keycard isn't working.  


It's crazy that one of the DEVGRU operators was literally a crack addict and failed part of the selection but he was pushed through as someone who was a politician with conenctions was backing him. He even relapsed and was still kept and supported, but he served with honour then was KIA, a very skilled operator.  


It really says something though. People can look at the lower amount of black people in the most elite units, or even decades ago when racism was far more fierce... It tells you that even a white dude that doesn't have connections is disadvantaged.  


So what black person  who is a former crackhead would be selected for SEAL teams then DEVGRU having failed part of selection but been pushed through anyway? It would never happen.  


Interesting how much of the most elite special forces units it's like a school girl circle/ old boys club theres a lot of politics and popularity contests and people  basically get through on favours at times

&amp;#x200B;

People have even said that DJ Shipley who was like the youngest ever NAVY SEAL was basically guaranteed a spot in the SEAL teams because his father  (Don Shipley) retired and it was like a ""swap"" with kind of an understanding he took his place.

I would question a few of the supposed tank kills I've seen with 30mm autocannon. A lot of soviet era tanks carry external fuel tanks that would light up in a big fireball without necessarily causing much damage to the tank.

Good luck hitting tank armour with 30mm HE enough times to breach it before you are lit up like a birthday candle.

Japan was definitely trying to surrender already, but they wanted a negotiated surrender with conditions, so they could have a somewhat favorable outcome. The Allies unanimously insisted on unconditional surrender, which Japan refused. 

The Soviet invasion was a huge shock, but not for any military reason. Manchuria had already been given up as lost by Japan, since their army in the region was cut off by US naval blockade and starving to death, so its loss wasn't a surprise. The USSR also didn't have any amphibious assault capabilities in the Pacific, so an invasion of Japan wasn't seriously a threat. (When the Soviets did occupy some northern islands, they had to borrow US landing ships in order to do so). 

What *was* a surprise was that the Soviet declaration of war effectively ended Japan's chance for a conditional surrender. Prior to that, the Soviets had been backchanneling with Japan (ie unofficial negotiations), promising them that a conditional surrender could be achieved. This hope for conditional surrender was what kept Japan's ""peace faction"" in power, while its hardliners advocated for fighting to the death and inflicting massive losses on the invaders. 

When the Soviets attacked, these backchannel negotiations were revealed as a ruse, and it became immediately clear to the Japanese government that their only way to achieve peace was unconditional surrender. The news of this was delivered at the same time as the Nagasaki bombing, serving as a double whammy - initially, the Japanese thought the US could only possibly build 1 bomb, so weathering its impact was possible. 

Faced with the threat of repeated nuclear attacks - which they could not effectively fight - and the lost hope of a negotiated surrender, the Emperor publicly threw his weight behind an unconditional surrender. Even then, the hardliners advocated fighting to the death, and attempted a coup to continue the war. So the surrender was a close run thing.",b7d610b1444c78e519b58380701d43879af8dc73,True,False,,,,,0,1650011132,,0,{},i4t4x0w,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4rudsh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4t4x0w/,1650011147,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649982332.0,

That's why people recommend not to use those colours in sports, they consider it to be an unfair advantage.",c2e2437c4fed3463d8802d8a05b1e77620c187bc,True,False,,,,,0,1650009612,,0,{},i4t348i,False,t3_u3qude,False,True,t1_i4r55od,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3qude/situation_in_mariupol_according_to_russian_sources/i4t348i/,1650009626,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649980812.0,

Yup. Doesn’t appear to be very effective. 

&gt;	They also have the turret maneuver on detection to help bolster its defenses. 

It’s called ‘slewing’ and it doesn’t apply to a Jav. 

&gt;	A moving t-90 with smoke flairs going 

Those ancient things can’t detect when a Jav is targeting them and won’t know when to pop the flares, but as you say, it may barely work even when deployed. 50/50 isn’t a good survival rate. 

&gt;	The US armed multiple groups in Syria with javelins..?

‘Sent them’ isn’t ‘multiple examples’ of them working or not working against ERA. Still no citation. 

&gt;	In terms of global hardware, thats pretty modern to me..

‘Modern’ does not include tech from the Vietnam War.  The Aero is an interesting upgrade, as is the 2B warhead, but the wire guided system is old. For the TOW, it also requires horizontal flight which renders them very weak against a functioning APS, which is the whole reason for the Aero.  If they aren’t fire and forget high AoA ATGMs, or BLOS, they aren’t modern. 

&gt;	I disagree. High angle of attack is the weapon of today, whereas there hasn’t been much innovation very recently in terms of defending against said advances. The next big leap will stem from the reaction to top down missiles imo.

That’s a big thing to say when not a single APS has been shown to work against them in any data set I’ve ever seen; for ~25 years. Anyway, the Drone Age will over take such systems eventually, yes. There is still not a single thing set to counter EFP submunitions like the SMArt. So while the warhead may deployed on a drone or a submunition and not a missile, the point stands that the tank is dead on the modern battlefield, except for very limited and specific use cases.",715bc0bd664aed0d93eb114a07292ca17353c5c1,True,False,,,,,0,1650009399,,0,{},i4t2uy9,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4t1mlu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4t2uy9/,1650009410,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649980599.0,

Russia has been putting ERA's on their turrets to reduce the effectiveness of top down strikes. It isn't super effective (I think the current estimates is a 60-70% hit ratio in single shot scenario from a distance). They also have the turret maneuver on detection to help bolster its defenses. A moving t-90 with smoke flairs going has from what I've read, roughly a 50-50 chance of avoiding a direct, critical hit. Thats not a silver bullet, but it is a damn effective weapon against Russia either way, i'll give you that.

&gt;What ‘multiple examples’ do we have for modern a ATGM being used in Syria? A Javelin? A Type 01 LMAT? A TOW 2B Aero?

The US armed multiple groups in Syria with javelins..?

&gt;Wired missiles? The Aero is making an attempt at modernity but wired systems are not modern.

In terms of global hardware, thats pretty modern to me.. I can agree to disagree on what we consider modern as its rather subjective.

&gt;High Angle of Attack missiles with top attack modes are the future.

I disagree. High angle of attack is the weapon of today, whereas there hasn't been much innovation very recently in terms of defending against said advances. The next big leap will stem from the reaction to top down missiles imo.",d67c0303ff9949f583f09b241f1108a2fba8bf92,True,False,,,,,0,1650008365,,0,{},i4t1mlu,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4syqd8,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4t1mlu/,1650008379,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649979565.0,

It's only logical to assume that tech which was designed to be a potential equal actually is - and dangerous to assume it isn't. 
If Russia sends in their best and latest equipment, and it gets defeated by a nation with a fraction of their military size/budget, then that would very quickly diminish their global perceived power and would serve both as a morale boost to the enemy along with the opposite for their own forces.
Losses like those would serve to embolden their enemies  both current and potentially future ones.

Sterling posted a story around 8 years ago about the first atheist they ever met, Lawrence (Larry) D Mahan - I went and did some searching about Lawrence, who was killed in action on September 18th, 1944, and found this website which has a page about him:

[https://www.honorstates.org/index.php?id=350679](https://www.honorstates.org/index.php?id=350679)

There wasn't a photo, so I uploaded the photo Sterling posted - hopefully it's updated in a few days.

What evidence do we have that the modern US ATGM “has gone up against” the Shtora? The modern ATGMs don’t even use lasers, and the only other thing the Russians even claim the Shtora can do, is counter SACLOS missiles. 

&gt;	The Shtora-1 and reactive armor have been proven as relatively effective against most if not all modern AT munitions (within reason obviously).

What modern ATGM is susceptible to a single facet of the Shtora system? What ERA ‘has been proven’ against modern AT munitions? How do they hold up against dual warheads, against EFPs?

&gt;	we have seen multiple examples in Syria showing these tanks are more than capable of holding their own against said systems. 

What ‘multiple examples’ do we have for modern a ATGM being used in Syria? A Javelin? A Type 01 LMAT? A TOW 2B Aero?

Says it can carry 5kg or 11lb which will easily cover the weight of an RPG round.  They also mention these adapted with fins.   Even the oldest model seems like it would easily penetrate the roof of a tank.  A quick read of the net tells me top armor on a T72 is 25 to 40mm.  I guess the reactive armor would defeat it, but there are still a lot of gaps in the ERA coverage on top.

They did as they were told, changed into civilian clothing in case they were caught, and then walked along a road waiting for the bus to arrive.. instead ISIS showed up on many vehicles and got off with guns in hand telling them they would not be harmed and take them home.

Instead they told them to split up into non-religious+Shia from Sunni and if they said they were Sunni but weren't they would regret it.

What they did not tell them was that they would kill everyone that wasn't Sunni (everyone in the video) regardless, so they lied to them at least twice.

Reports say about 1,000-1,100 were killed but it could have been at least 1,800.  No one is 100% positive, but there are also reports from the lone survivor that they were sold out by the Iraqi Officers who told ISIS about the cadets in exchange for them to get away with their lives.  Of course the Officers who lived denied this since all the Cadets who could have spoken the truth (minus the one survivor who was interviewed by the NY Times and is still alive with his family today iirc) are now all dead.

Truly horrific and I am pretty sure most of the ISIS soldiers in this video have been killed over the years.  There may be a few left but their day will come.  They have perverted Islam to say it's okay to kill anyone else that isn't them when the Quran does not teach that at all.  They essentially took one line in the Quran talking about a specific moment in time (and it doesn't even tell them to kill anyone) and turned it into an excuse to become serial killers and mass murderers.  

They use these backwoods teachings to recruit uneducated or angry people from other countries, where they do stupid things like behead two Scandinavian girls who were just going on a trip around the world.  Or recruit that Canadian guy into ISIS and then send him on the front lines to get blown up for their stupid ISIS propaganda videos when the kid had no combat experience whatsoever.

Or you get guys like Jihadi John who grew up in London and was bullied for having bad breath all his life when his horrible mother didn't teach him how to brush his teeth or his tongue, which fueled his hate for mankind and made him happy to behead people who had never done a thing to him.

And now we have the northern part of the island with an unremovable amount of Turks who can only be removed by another ethnic cleansing if anyone dares...So I suggest you to deal with it.

And at least we only removed greeks from the northern part, didn't try to cleanse them all from the island, unlike what greeks attempted to do between 1950s and 1970s or did in Crete, Balkans etc. during their independence war, balkan wars etcç. Here take a look:

""According to Justin McCarthy, between the years 1821–1922, from the beginning of the Greek War of Independence to the end of the Ottoman Empire, five million Muslims were driven from their lands and another five and a half million died, some of them killed in wars, others perishing as refugees from starvation or disease."" That's like half the population of Ottoman Empire, 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_Muslims\_during\_the\_Ottoman\_contraction#:\~:text=According%20to%20Justin%20McCarthy%2C%20between,as%20refugees%20from%20starvation%20or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims_during_the_Ottoman_contraction#:~:text=According%20to%20Justin%20McCarthy%2C%20between,as%20refugees%20from%20starvation%20or)

Mind you, Turks living in Anatolia were less than 10 million during those periods...

Moreover there had been no bloodshed in the island after we re-conquered the northern part, if we didn't intervene in 74, there'd been violence for years to come, and probably tens of thousands Turks and greeks would have died, and would have suffered terrific deaths because of nature of civil wars, such examples are: Yugoslavia, Syria etc.

Whereas during Op. Atilla total KIAs and MIAs: 1600 for Turks and 1500 - 1600 for greeks, with 1/3 of each side being military, so this issue had been resolved with 2000 KIA and MIA civilians in total from both sides.

That's not the same thing. The bulk of the Japanese army had not been engaged in combat and they had approximately 2.5million men on the Home Islands with at least that many spread around their various holdings. They had the capacity and the will to resist for far longer and were indeed planning to do so, even after the first bombing.

The war was not won yet, but even if it was, they most certainly didn't know it. In fact, the Allies believed the opposite as they had intercepted numerous communications to that effect. You have the benefit of 80 years hindsight to assume the war was about to end anyways yet all the facts point to many months more of war, at the very least. Hell, the war was unwinnable for Japan by the end of 1942 yet there 3 more years of war anyways, just to illustrate the point.

The Soviets were not going to invade the Home Islands. They got involved as a land grab but the war was not going to be ended by the invasion of Manchuria alone and its silly to think the Soviets were going to be the ones landing troops on the islands.

But assume that the invasion was never really going to happen, like you keep claiming (falsely, based on the build up that was already occurring). So then the Japanese are starved into submission and millions die of famine and disease while the US blockades the seas and Russia picks up tasty morsels of land. You really think that's a better alternative to the atomic bombings? The bombings hardly killed anyone relative to conventional bombings and many of the deaths were due to lack of medical care to survivors vs the detonation itself. 

I don't really see your point. So maybe the atomic bomb wasn't necessary. Maybe they could have just waited for many more civilians to die off on their own or maybe they could have invaded, is that really a ""better"" alternative? Let's even assume the Soviet invasion played a larger role than the bombing (it didn't). Even then, it alone wouldn't have been enough and nor would the bombings. So what is your end conclusion here?

The Chechens that remained alive by 2000 were fierce and experienced, and had been fighting for years against Russia. They’re not likely to be fighting for Kadyrov. Those guys were able to hold their own against Russian GRU recon groups in equal numbers.

What we have today are still inherently Chechens, which are a true warrior culture. Despite this, their experience is no different than the average RU serviceman. Some Chechens served in Syria as Military Police, but this was mostly due to speaking Arabic and was by no means ubiquitous enough to count as overall combat experience.

The advantage Kadyrov has over the average RU soldier is he can equip his men at 2-3x the cost. They’re better geared, that’s it.

Despite their affinity for a Saudi-esque social media presence and form over function, they’re an effective fighting force with effective equipment. Sure, they make a bunch of Tik Tok style videos, but they’re also genuinely fighting in Mariopol and DNR fighters seem grateful.

You see in the video they are attacking groups of multiple enemies, you can see its multiple humvees and in one of them its even an APC in the convoy as well. A soldier with an RPG can only rocket 1 vehicle before a reload. This gives time for the enemy infantry to respond, and the Iraqi army wears body armour which means it'll take multiple shots to break through it, and even after you pierce it 7.62x39mm FMJ ammo that uses a steel core, like M43 russian FMJ, will have a small wound channel instead of the bigger wound channel the Yugoslavian M67 FMJ ammo gives because it tumbles when it hits flesh while M43 tends to icepick. And people in this region can't decide to choose what ammo they use, they use whatever is available which means a hodgepodge of every brand possible.

Now think how many enemies could be at these parked convoys? A humvee has about 5 people, we see about 3 humvees in each video, so thats 15 enemies around. You will need multiple people to be able to destroy all of the vehicles and kill the enemies at the same time, with no guarantees of success. **OR** you could send 1 guy with a SVBIED to blow everything up in a 30m radius and kill people who are inside buildings as well, anyone in the radius of that whether in cover or not is fucked.",6c03f7070e11a580ac478e17069ea0e79d4e0962,True,False,,,,,0,1649993730,,0,{},i4sgei5,False,t3_u31n2z,False,False,t1_i4q5huz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u31n2z/isis_suicide_vehicles_detonating_iraqi_army_date/i4sgei5/,1649993744,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649964930.0,

You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.

Ultimately, the recoil from the 30mm is minuscule compared to the weight of the helicopter. Also, the barrel has a large muzzle break that's pretty effective.

Israel is not killing civilians in this flare up, the Palestinian ISIS and Islamic Jihad has staged a series or terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. I just don't understand how anyone can support or make excuses for ISIS knifing pregnant women or an Islamic Jihad militant opening fire into a bar.

The Israeli incursions into Jenin went to get those that planned organized the attacks and the infrastructure that armed them.

Those killed were either armed with fire arms, or were throwing firebombs at Israeli forces, making them combatants, even at 14. Instead of blaming Israel, a person with a moral compass would blame the Palestinians for using child soldiers, an actual war crime.

&gt; calling for an extermination of the “dogs” and “animals” that occupy their Zion

This is literally not true, It's your [Palestinian buddies that call for the extermination of Jews worldwide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azEgBsU6Mi8&amp;t=10s), meanwhile Israel has an actual Islamist part in it's government.

&gt;Israel has slowly taken over Palestinian land

Again, you're deeply deeply ignorant, I seriously advise you to look at information aside from extremist Palestinian propaganda. The Jews have always lived in Palestine, before the Arabs. The Arabs ethnically cleansed the Jews from Judea and Samarea, and Gaza in the 1948 war. When Israel recaptured the land in 1967, the Jews went back to living in places they have inhabited for thousands of years, such as Hebron, a city founded by Jews, Eastern Jerusalem, another city founded by Jews, and Gush Ezion.

Do you honestly believe that Jews are not allowed to live in Judea? Are Arabs that live and build homes in Israel taking ""Jewish land""? See how your arguments make no sense and are actually extremely racist?",73ac9b49081cb2247b63d9da79294444562b2c40,True,False,,,,,0,1649991426,,0,{},i4sbz09,False,t3_u2xgtv,False,True,t1_i4s6tvy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u2xgtv/video_shows_pij_militants_in_firefight_with_idf/i4sbz09/,1649991437,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649962626.0,

I know that RU is in full propaganda mode - which includes ordering their troops to manufacture scenes and video them for propaganda purposes, and includes publishing fake video after stealing BBC logos to make it look like a BBC report and not something from TASS.  Maybe you saw the fake video about the supposed POWs shot in the legs by ""UKR"" forces?  Fake.  How about the US General captured and executed by RU in Donbas?  Or the reports that Moskva was lost 'in a storm' after 'catching fire' with no mention of the two anti-ship missiles UKR hit it with?  

I'm looking at the videos and trying to figure out what was plausible - I'm not jumping to conclusions.  As new information arrived, that analytical opinion changed.  Now that there's confirmation from the Ukrainians, it's clear this was indeed a UKR team capturing a RU BMP that was approached and killed by a RU tank that was part of the crowd running for Belarus.

I did some research, and since I got out of the Army (2014) they actually have transitioned most infantry units to the M4A1 which does have automatic capability (fire selector goes: safe, semi, auto). From what I could read, the main rationale for the conversion was to obtain a heavier and more durable barrel, and because the automatic fire trigger mechanism leads to a softer and more consistent trigger pull which should lead to more accurate semi auto fire. 

Fighting in Afghanistan showed the Army that soldiers needed more durable barrels, as regular M4 barrels were melting and warping during extended fights. The M4A1 came with the better barrel (because it is built to stand up to auto fire) and a better trigger to boot. Those were the reasons for the change, not because big Army wants its soldiers flipping to auto. 

Why? And why does SF use full auto more often? A big reason is because of the makeup of an infantry squad. The argument for full auto rifles largely revolves around the occasional need for suppressing fire. A regular infantry squad has far better tools for that than a battle rifle. A squad will have 9 soldiers. Two will be carrying SAW’s and 2 will be equipped with grenade launchers. In addition there is also a platoon heavy machine gun squad that can provide support when needed. That’s a lot of firepower to bring to bear when needed. That’s also a lot more firepower than a typical SF team will be carrying. No need to have riflemen conduct suppressing fire, better to have them take controlled and well aimed shots.",930ebc4f2544c8e05bf4f7068f76ec4ee2ee387f,True,False,,,,,0,1649986432,,0,{},i4s1kqg,False,t3_u3do4s,False,True,t1_i4r6l6f,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3do4s/urban_combat_in_mariupol_april_13th/i4s1kqg/,1649986450,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649957632.0,

Why did the civilians were NOT ask to go the moment this started on 2/24 or before ? Russians were practicing cohesive politics since -a-year-before-. the first buildup was in March 2021! So why not. Maybe having the attention of the world with people suffering would help the Ukrainian side. Whomever wanted to have this fight from the Ukrainian side should have been on the front line day ONE!  


I have zero vested interest in either side, as a mater of fact I hate both sides in this conflict not good people, I would actually dare to say that Russians were more humans than Ukrainians - holocaust wouldn't have happened without Ukrainian collaborators/nazis. PERIOD!  


if the Ukrainians wanted their state the should have said here's the east, never belonged to us, we take the West and we declare neutral. BUT no, little zelensky aka the crush of Midwest wives aka the Napoleon of Ukraine thought lets stick it to Russia or else these Azov guys stick it to me !   


Anyhow here's what's going to happen.  


1. if Russian don't achieve all they want they will carpet bomb stuff. I've watched things, they don't use anything similarly with what US used in the past, they can carpet bomb whole areas if they want. However, they seem to care about civilians, yet the west plays it that no they don't care, and Ukrainians don't let people leave the combat area. they want their own citizen to die so maybe a red line is going to be crossed!
2. if Russians achieve what they want in this SO/War Ukraine will be neutral, all the death and the destruction is going to be on the hands of those that could avoid it, territory will be loss. those that call Russians security need a joke those own this and the outcome.  

3. WW3 - End of Game!  


clearly Ukrainians though people give a shit. If Ukrainians want ""blood money"" not to reach Russia why don't they shut down North Stream ONE!   


Yep!   


Why ?  


Ukraine helps selling Russian oil and gas thru NS1 and they never stopped it!

You aren’t wrong though. Dropping the bomb was done for a number of reasons. It did not help that President Truman was also only in office for a couple months, tasked with completing a costly global war in the shadow of his predecessor. Truman was pretty green, and most likely decided to go with the flow and momentum that FDR had set in place with the atomic program. 

The number one reason I learned in uni is that Truman was incredibly worried about the backlash from the American public if they learned of the bomb’s existence and Truman’s choice to not use it - finding out that Truman had a Ace in the hole but chose to send thousands of lives in the conquering of Japan. And again, all of this is predicated on the fact that Japan agreed to surrender, it’s just that they only wanted to surrender on their terms. 

And truthfully, after learning about the number of atrocities committed by the Japanese against the Chinese, Koreans, and countless other Pacific peoples for decades - Japan needed a moral reckoning and wake up call.

3551,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,True,"You seem to be missing some key information:

1.  Russia has huge logistics issues.  That is one of the main reasons they're losing. They can't supply the men they already have in the field.  This isn't a video game.  You can't just hit the ""mobilize"" button and march your big army into Ukraine. They can't just shove a million men into an area where they are having trouble supporting 30K. You need food, shells, gas, clothes, showers, tents, sleeping bags, medicine, parts, etc.. and you need trucks and trains to deliver it. You can't just throw meat at the problem or you'll have a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field. Russia suffers mostly from a lack of equipment (and trained operators of that equipment), not manpower.   It isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around.  Usually it is better to have them as spares when you own guys get killed. 

2. Mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you need like I talked about in point #1. That is a more realistic thing that Russia needs. Reports indicate that Russia is doing that already to the best of their ability. Unfortunately for Russia there are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion and have been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc..). They might be able to field an army armed with AK-74's, boots, and some Kevlar, but that's it.  They're already having trouble equipping their current army with basics, trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. Also, Russia doesn't have a big economy.  They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They don't have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip anything near what they need the next few months (by which time the war may already be decided.)  

3. You need to train all these people or all you'd end up with is a bunch of conscripts with (likely) poor morale, training, etc.. who are a hinderance rather than a benefit. That takes time and the war might be over by then.  Russia is also performing poorly because their army fucking sucks at war.  If they're already having trouble training recruits to a minimum standard, how is attempting something far larger going to be an automatic improvement? You might just end up with 500K useless bodies at a huge cost. You need to scale your goals to something achievable and useful.

4. If you mobilize people for war and take them away from their normal jobs, you fuck over your economy and possibly make things worse in the long-term financially.  You need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war. 

5. Conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan).  Big surprise, people don't like being used as cannon fodder.  It might cause people to revolt, which is worse for Putin than losing the war. Legally, they can't send guys into an offensive war (or at least that's what has been reported). Putin himself has said they will not send conscripts. When reports did emerge about conscripts being caught in Ukraine he made a bunch of pronouncements and called for them to be immediately removed. He even made a big show about it. This seems like a sensitive issue politically. 

6. They are starting to push for a large involvement on Russian state TV. Or at least talk about the possible necessity of larger conscription. So it isn't like they don't understand they might need more troops in the future. They just also understand they need popular support for the idea. It is a hard sell to get people to agree to conscription when they don't believe in the cause and when you've already had trouble subduing Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of troops already. 

7. Before mobilization, activating semi-trained reserves is Step One.  Russia is already trying to do that.  

8. Russia has an immediate manpower problem now, due to the aforementioned legal issues. In the future however, it likely won't be a manpower problem, but instead a materiel problem.  Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate.  At some point, if Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with guns getting annihilated by Artillery, Tanks, SPGs, etc.. 

9. Russia has huge demographic issues.  Losing a ton of young people might break the country regardless of if it would win them the war.  All you'd achieve is a Pyrrhic victory.

Truman and his advisors knew that Stalin entering the war would cause the Japanese to surrender, and was urging him to do so. Meanwhile the Japanese were urging him to mediate a conditional surrender to avoid Hirohito being executed for war crimes.

This is all documented history, the problem is that the indoctrination runs too deep for most people, who've been taught that it took a miraculous scientific advancement to put down the Japanese will to fight but the truth just does not stand up to that scrutiny.

The US knew the bombs were unnecessary, but dropped them anyways, because the point of the bombing wasn't to force Japanese capitulation, but Soviet submission.

\- maybe they can't afford to call a full mobilization which means definitely a longer war with a possible escalation against NATO, something Putin will try to avoid.

\- Russian army struggled to manage and supply 200k troops in an invasion that required from a logistic standpoint to just pass their own border, so I don't know how they would handle a way bigger amount of troops. Also a full mobilization will give you a tons of troops but with limited to zero combat experience, so it would be a desperate move they will try to avoid. 

\- this one is an improbable scenario, but can't be left off the table: it's risky to put most of your army in one place leaving a huge part of your country without a decent military protection.

Yeah I know they have a 30mm cannon with a pretty high rate of fire but I am surprised how easily those penetrate the armor based on the explosions during impact. 

That would suck being a tanker thinking that only other tanks and ATGMs (which are fucking hanging from the back of every infantry dude it seems so they are PLENTIFUL) but I would have though those transports would have not posed that much of a threat to frontal armor.

Are they using tungsten or depleted uranium rounds? Seems it would take some extremely heavy/dense material in order for it to pack such a punch, and it seems they shoot at roughly about the same rate of speed (around 3100fps) as a standard AR-15 5.56 rifle which is hauling the mail, its not quite going as fast as really quick rifle rounds like a 220 swift which is a 22 caliber round which can run at as high as 4.300fps which is ridiculous!

Attacks delivered by an inexperienced air force on the first day of the war at 4AM were bound to miss some targets. That is where attacks on purely civilian locations came from.

In all the extensive preserved Luftwaffe records there is not a single paper advocating or ordering an attack on cities before the London Blitz of 1940 - which followed after the RAF attacks on German cities.",0bc3e97b3a7eb8e56d8ea6e5a11545f4249c165c,True,False,,,,,0,1649979804,,0,{},i4rndkp,False,t3_u32mt5,False,True,t1_i4rmfen,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32mt5/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41422/i4rndkp/,1649979822,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649951004.0,

No, you'd see that I am NEUTRAL. I have been following these types of conflicts for longer than you've probably had internet man.. Please, show my post praising anything from either side. Don't worry, I won't hold my breath. Gotta love a guy whos willing to go through 2 months of reddit history, misquotes the person, and then refuses to ""prove me wrong on my misquote allegations"" because it magically just now became too much work.. LOL

&gt;About the tanks. Which modern tanks are you talking about? T-80u or T-80BVMs? T-90As? We have seen them all mate.

You have not seen t-90's used in any mentionable capacity in comparison to the countless older vehicles they are using.. Again, just because upwards to a dozen tanks have been SPOTTED doesn't mean they are incapable of defending against modern AT munitions. That was the point of my comment from before that you attempted to wildly misrepresent to suit your nonsense. Even NATO has come out and said the majority of equipment being used in this conflict aside from missiles themselves is generally older, less capable tech. The new tech that DOES get used, has shown pretty decent results in terms of accuracy. The only poor performer thats worth noting might be their new Heli's still getting downed by basic AA tech and showing signs of instability during flight.

&gt;Do you think the Assault on Kyiv was indeed planned as a ""distraction"" like they claim now?

It wasn't part of the main plan. They did not expect as much resistance aswell as how quickly the West managed to send much needed Tech to hold defensive positions against a heavy military force.

&gt; Or do you believe that they realized that they wouldn't be able to take Kyiv and therefore choose to cut their losses and come up with this ridiculous ""distraction"" excuse instead?

This line of questioning alone proves just how biased you are. According to you, there is no alternative possibility other than what you post because thats what you have made up in your mind as what you want to see. For me, I have plenty of experience following these conflicts to know that this is a strategy pivot in hopes of creating less dug fighting to reduce their losses. No military goes into a conflict and goes ""we are following plan A, there is no need or use for a plan B if something doesn't go right""... Alot of these operations know that it won't go exactly as planned, which is why alot of militaries like the US designate soldiers to be capable of changing the plan on the fly. Russia as a whole does not do this, causing great difficulties in their ability to react to a changing situation. 

So long story short, they decided the progress in Kiev was too slow after the initial push, and was costing more than it should for what it was worth. So instead, they are pivoting just like they did in Syria/Chechnya to drag out their opponents into more open field fights and force them to create logistics problems just like Russia has been forced to deal with due to ambushes.",1c7240aa4f824b89d69a0c226b8f2899e2d61db9,True,False,,,,,0,1649977046,,0,{},i4rh6ts,False,t3_u3lqoe,False,True,t1_i4rf5le,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3lqoe/map_update_ukraine_1442022_source_ministery_of/i4rh6ts/,1649977065,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649948246.0,

Also a high profile journalist in France confirmed US-NATO has been running the show in Ukraine. He has **evidence** and French soldiers as **witnesses** when he accompanied them to Ukraine to join the fight. Which makes sense. This war is very hot, you can't have random foreign troops just join without a legit structure of background checks etc Or you could recruit a mole easy. And Ukraine just doesn't have that database. Before we even get to the C2 logistics etc

Most of us in the west have been blindly listening to Biden saying ""there will be NATO or US boots on the ground"" while in fact they are already there. A few days ago almost 1 billion in new aid is urgently being sent to try and exfil the remaining hvts in Asovstal and begin the next phase.

- Why did the Pentagon said something different? 

- Does the sinking of 1 ship means the war has ended?
 
- Ukrainians did not sink the ship but are taking credit for it. 

- The sinking of one ship will not change the course of war. 

- Material damage is always expected at wars. 

- Meanwhile media is full going into this Moskva thing while forgetting that Mariupol is about to be liberated

- Media totally dismissing the fact that 2000 Ukrainian soldiers have surrendered over the past few days in Mariupol

- When Mariupol has fallen the black-sea will be semi-controlled by Russia

- A push towards Odessa through Nikolaev is highly possible after Mariupol 

- Russian resolve becomes only stronger (dont forget that Ukrainians shelled areas within Russia today)

Think about it, warships are compartmentalised heavily if one part is damaged it's usually still operational. Warships have their own set of encoded transponders and comms to ask for help in distress.

The only reason they would be sending out SART SINK signal is if they are effectively going down and are requesting any available civilian or military ship for assistance. If you are sending out SART SINK it means you ain't going left, right or forward. You are going down.

SINK is the highest order signal, its an interrupt signal on all frequencies to all ships civilian, military, fishing, shipping for emergency.

That would take a lot of firepower.

Everything we have seen so far shows that the Russians have thrown everything into the battle of Mariupol that they thought they could miss elsewhere during this invasion. 

Flattening the Azov Steel works would also not do much to get the Ukrainian fighters that are in the underground tunnels out of those. Them running out of ammo and food is way more likely to have that result.

&gt;without trouble or costly campaigns or forceful reforms

Aside from the loss of democracy? Equality was foisted on society. It came at the unquantifiable cost of democracy whereas we in the west have the luxury of counting how many dollar bills various ""campaigns"" have ""costed to shape opinion"".

Russia, and the regions comprising the empire, had an egalitarian revolution which forced equality among the genders. The East was ahead of the West in this regard but by the 70s the West caught up due to Western culture beginning to promote the idea of more female representation in society (which I, by the way, don't see as a ""costly campaign"" but just a cultural shift because of the ideas that manifest in the 60s.)

When you write:

&gt;Women in Eastern Europe are very keen to take a leading role in society. They are very active politically, take leading roles in business and other parts of society and are respected just like men.

you just make it sound like an exclusively Eastern European thing, and later in your comment admit that the representation is about average for the rest of Europe. I am Swedish. We've been egalitarian in our society since a long, long time back. Same thing's the case for many parts of Europe. Women in Eastern Europe are not more keen to take a leading role in society than say women in Sweden, or Denmark, or Norway, or Finland, or Germany are.

The west has only lagged behind the east in terms of female representation in the military but even this has changed as of the past 10-15 years. The difference between the two spheres is very minimal today, I'd argue it's actually more egalitarian in the West today than it is in the East (aside for military representation because of the East's head start). Western women are far more keen to taking a leading role in society today than women in say Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, Belarus, Hungary or other former Eastern Bloc countries are.",1cddc56788893bfe6065ffdd15f9a13c21671959,True,False,,,,,0,1649968575,,0,{},i4qx6y3,False,t3_u3m2bs,False,True,t1_i4qv9gc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3m2bs/women_from_the_armed_forces_of_ukraine_came_under/i4qx6y3/,1649968592,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649939775.0,

United States of America
In 1992, in its final report to Congress on the conduct of the Gulf War, the US Department of Defense stated:
The law of war obligates a party to a conflict to accept the surrender of enemy personnel and thereafter treat them in accordance with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims …
However, there is a gap in the law of war in defining precisely when surrender takes effect or how it may be accomplished in practical terms. Surrender involves an offer by the surrendering party (a unit or an individual soldier) and an ability to accept on the part of his opponent. The latter may not refuse an offer of surrender when communicated, but that communication must be made at a time when it can be received and properly acted upon – an attempt at surrender in the midst of a hard-fought battle is neither easily communicated nor received. The issue is one of reasonableness.
A combatant force involved in an armed conflict is not obliged to offer its opponent an opportunity to surrender before carrying out an attack … In the process [of military operations], Coalition forces continued to accept legitimate Iraqi offers of surrender in a manner consistent with the law of war. The large number of Iraqi prisoners of war is evidence of Coalition compliance with its law of war obligations with regard to surrendering forces. 
The report also referred to two incidents during the Gulf War in which there had been allegations that quarter had been denied. The first incident involved an armoured assault on an entrenched position where tanks equipped with earthmoving plough blades were used to breach the trench line and then turned to fill in the trenches and the bunkers. The Department of Defense defended this tactic as consistent with the law of war. It noted that:
In the course of the breaching operations, the Iraqi defenders were given the opportunity to surrender, as indicated by the large number of EPWs [enemy prisoners of war] taken by the division. However, soldiers must make their intent to surrender clear and unequivocal, and do so rapidly. Fighting from fortified emplacements is not a manifestation of an intent to surrender, and a soldier who fights until the very last possible moment assumes certain risks. His opponent either may not see his surrender, may not recognize his actions as an attempt to surrender in the heat and confusion of battle, or may find it difficult (if not impossible) to halt an onrushing assault to accept a soldier’s last-minute effort at surrender. 
The second incident concerned the attack on Iraqi forces while they were retreating from Kuwait City. The Department of Defense again defended the attack as consistent with the law of war. It noted:
The law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating or standing still. Retreat does not prevent further attack …
In the case at hand, neither the composition, degree of unit cohesiveness, nor intent of the Iraqi military forces engaged was known at the time of the attack. At no time did any element within the formation offer to surrender. CENTCOM [Central Command] was under no law of war obligation to offer the Iraqi forces an opportunity to surrender before the attack. 

United States of America
The Report on US Practice states:
The opinio juris of the United States is that quarter must not be refused to an enemy who communicates an offer to surrender under circumstances permitting that offer to be understood and acted upon by U.S. forces. A combatant who appears merely incapable or unwilling to fight, e.g., because he has lost his weapon or is retreating from the battle, but who has not communicated an offer to surrender, is still subject to attack. (Persons hors de combat due to wounds, sickness or shipwreck must of course be respected in all circumstances, in accordance with the First and Second Geneva Conventions of 1949).",869d5cc9305c76c4b9eaafa520d731c63b33caee,True,False,,,,,0,1649968466,,0,{},i4qwwxw,False,t3_u32s4d,False,True,t1_i4pc3g9,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32s4d/2_ah64d_apache_gunships_engage_a_taliban_platoon/i4qwwxw/,1649968480,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649939666.0,

&gt;without trouble or costly campaigns or forceful reforms

Aside from the loss of democracy? Equality was foisted on society. It came at the unquantifiable price of democracy whereas we in the west have the luxury of counting how many dollar bills various ""campaigns"" have ""costed to influence society"".

Russia, and the regions comprising the empire, had an egalitarian revolution which forced equality among the genders. The East was ahead of the West in this regard but by the 70s the West caught up because Western culture began promoting the idea of women having higher representation in society as well (which I don't see as a ""costly campaign"", it was a cultural shift because of the ideas that manifest during the 60s.)

When you write: *""Women in Eastern Europe are very keen to take a leading role in society. They are very active politically, take leading roles in business and other parts of society and are respected just like men.""*

you just make it sound like an exclusively Eastern European thing, and later in your comment admit that the representation is about average for the rest of Europe. I am Swedish. We've been egalitarian in our society since a long, long time back. Same thing's the case for most parts of Europe. Women in Eastern Europe are not more keen to take a leading role in society than women in Sweden, or Denmark, or Norway, or Finland, or Germany are.

The west has only lagged behind the east in terms of female representation in the military but even this has changed as of the past 10-15 years. The difference between the two spheres is very minimal today, I'd argue it's actually more egalitarian in the West today than it is in the East (aside for military representation which the East got a head start in). Western women are far more keen to taking a leading role in society today than women in say Poland, Russia, Belarus, Czech Republic or other former Eastern Bloc countries are.",13fcecd4dbdf5bb8f4815738f465f2c1a5bb6e61,True,False,,,,,0,1649968384,,0,{},i4qwpi0,False,t3_u3m2bs,False,True,t1_i4qv9gc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3m2bs/women_from_the_armed_forces_of_ukraine_came_under/i4qwpi0/,1649968399,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649939584.0,

Truth is you are correct about the communism part. But the West pushed for these things in the 60s and 70s as well. The USSR was earlier, but the West ""caught up"" just a few decades later. Today, women aren't ""more respected"" or ""treated just like men"" in the East compared to the West. It's about the same, and has been similar since the 70s. Especially in politics and business.

They knew about using the islands to mask the attacks

That stuff about men violating orders to protect women is less scientific and more of a rumor.   


Also, I'd rather have a unit of trained and motivated women than a unit of untrained and unmotivated men. Obviously you'd always rather have trained and motivated men in combat but when you get invaded or when your survival as a nation/ people is at stake you make do with what you've got (look at USSR, Israel, and just about every resistance movement ever). I'm sure the  Ukrainian women are doing great work out there and I'm sure that the Ukrainian military would feel their loss if they all decided they should stop fighting.

PGMs basically require global supply chain. The amount of tech put into them them essentially requires outsourcing of materials and components. If you drill down to the literal raw materials required to put advanced, hardened computers in every single weapon you produce it is unsustainable on a mass scale. The raw materials  geologically available in a specific country cannot be 'out teched' to a degree. If you don't have a massive natural source of the materials required to produce computer chips you do not have the capability to domestically produce PGMs. These weapons require global trade and are vulnerable to chip shortages like we are seeing today. 

Steel, copper, and the chemicals to make high explosives are available domestically in almost every large country. There is no comparison even remotely close between the availability of those materials and the materials required to produce the computers, sensors, and various other components required for PGMs.

The infrastructure to make dumb weapons is infinitely more resilient than the factories that make the computers and components required for PGMs. This is true and will always be true. It is easier to make a steel shell then it is to build a computer. That will always matter in a massed conflict. There is no way around that. 

PGMs are good tools. They are great for limited conflict and precision strikes. They also require resources that are not universally available in the world. It is physically impossible for them to replace a weapon that is an order of magnitude cheaper and easier to produce in a massed conflict.",fdb05a7e063587a73a0e3abd35f93b491786be55,True,False,,,,,0,1649961208,,0,{},i4qekfc,False,t3_u3dudr,False,True,t1_i4q08rf,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3dudr/russian_2s7_pion_in_action_somewhere_in_ukraine/i4qekfc/,1649961223,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649932408.0,

The real change was during the Park administration.

In 1960 (before Park): 11,000 Koreans in America (vast majority adoptions, most remaining are wives)
In 1970 (mid-Park): 70,000 Koreans in America. (Juche starting)
In 1980 (end-Park): 354,000 Koreans in America.

&gt;SK also had plenty of student activism, despite the dictatorship objecting. 

I mean, Park crushed that from 4.19 (which Korean historians will tell you is straight bonkers, and is what led to Park's rule) onward. The big one (20 years later) occured after Park, and was overtly Marxist and almost violently crushed, so not really a great example of the  ""dictatorship objecting""  but the ""weak, new dictatorship losing""",2a66fea21336c7dbff07a42f04bac4cd21e55dd4,True,False,,,,,0,1649960001,,0,{},i4qbjti,False,t3_u32s4d,False,True,t1_i4q5wz0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32s4d/2_ah64d_apache_gunships_engage_a_taliban_platoon/i4qbjti/,1649960015,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649931201.0,

Serbians took over 8,000 men and boys and shot them all.  Then bulldozed their bodies into mass graves.  Young boys were billed in front of their fathers.  Some were buried alive.  The remaining women and young girls were warehoused separately and systematically raped, repeatedly.   It took the Serbians ten days to kill everyone.  

The modern usage of the term ""Ethnic Cleansing"" comes from the genocide the Serbians practiced on the Muslims in Bosnia.  What the Serbs did then was determined by the United Nations to be a legitimated act of genocide.  

Mass graves littered Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Mine shafts had bodies dumped down them everywhere.  Wells were filled with bodies.  Until the Russian's invaded Urkaine, the war in the former Yugoslavia was had the worst atrocities practiced since WW2. 

I lived in Chicago at the time.  We had a Serbian community at the time.  Many cab drivers were Serbs.  And they were unashamed by what was going on in Serbia and happy to tell you about it. 

Eventually, I became a bigot.  I still re-live in my minds eye the father holding his dying child in a foil blanket up to departing UN helicopters, seeking medical care for the injuries incurred in a blast.  Eventually the child died, on camera, the father sobbing.  The light had gone out in the world.  He was pure despair.

Finally, I would not talk to a Serbian immigrant and I would get out of  cab if the cab driver was Serbian.  To this day, I don't think I would pass even a word with a Serbian or Serb immigrant.

Makes sense.  


I thought this reddit was for combat footage in general, but apparently i am wrong.  


I specifically commented on the fact that OP stated that the music ""completely ruins it"", my question then is, what exactly does it ""ruin""?  


Pretty sure that it states in the rules, that music is allowed if this was edited in the original video by the one who originally posted it.

One could conceivably create a large diameter space laser (ie, the beam starting at several meter diameter which is then focused) which could sit in a high orbit and cover a large fraction of the planet.



However, given time on target required, heat generated by the laser, general tracking of warheads. I still envision that such a systems effectiveness would be poor in an all out nuclear exchange.




My point is. We are very far away from making a layered system which could give us close to 100% certainty of stopping all warheads in a MAD style exchange. Honestly, even if such a system was cheap to maintain and in place, it would still remain untested and MAD doctrine would still be in place.

My comment was a joke about being able to save a lot of money by no longer having to spend the money on a ship that is pretty much probably toast.

Surface ships are very expensive to maintain (well above simple salary costs) and the Moskva is an old behemoth running pretty inefficient engines. It has spent a lot of time over the years under dry dock, refit and with various mechanical issues.

Many of the larger Russian surface ships are just a money drain. But the navy is seen as a prestige branch of their armed forces.

As for being the Flagship, well any ship that carries the commanding officer of a fleet is called a flagship. Obviously in this day &amp; age, that can mean it has an enhanced command &amp; control centre, but most larger ships these days have pretty decent C &amp; C centres. For the US for example, a carrier might be the flagship, or a cruiser, a frigate or anything else depending upon the fleet that is being commanded by an admiral.",25a52e4c6e243c40bacb12d91b991f4c175cd5b5,True,False,,,,,0,1649957871,,0,{},i4q65hk,False,t3_u34auo,False,True,t1_i4pketz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u34auo/russia_says_ammunition_blast_badly_damages_major/i4q65hk/,1649957888,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649929071.0,

Cloud cover is gone less than ~50 seconds from launch for ICBMs. They leave the lower atmosphere to reach their midcourse phase, which is the longest timeframe of their operation from launch to detonation. The apogee is over 1000km up! Depending on design type, the beginning of midcourse is already between 150-400km in height already, far far above all clouds. All of which makes them sitting ducks for weapons that can paint a dot on them quite literally at light speed. 

SBIRS also has overwatch through inclement weather for missile launches. The thing about getting rockets into orbital trajectory is that they burn unbelievably hot. You couldn't even hide one under a hurricane, the heat signature is a dead giveaway to the look down IR sats. 

Of course, current land-based anti missile systems such as Aegis and THAAD are really only effective in small windows of opportunity, but those also include the terminal phase. The problem with that is the time to get enough birds flying to hit all of the MIRVs and sort the decoys, which becomes a non trivial issue in no time, to say nothing of having to maintain thousands upon thousands of defense missiles to feasibly cover even a decent regional area.",949622afc62a4512279a390dd5eaa6ff303c0cd0,True,False,,,,,0,1649957826,,0,{},i4q61eq,False,t3_u3juwg,False,True,t1_i4q1pia,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3juwg/footage_from_recent_tests_of_the_iron_beam_laser/i4q61eq/,1649957842,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649929026.0,

Also that throwback war comment is technically true, but it isn’t saying much. Pretty much every single piece of equipment (sans the 5th gen fighters) that the US employed are over 30 years old. Every country does that. It is much cheaper and more efficient to upgrade old equipment to new standards than to reinvent the wheel.

M1 Abrams: 1978
AH-64 Apache: 1975
M2 Bradley: 1982

I could go on forever with US equipment, but basically I’m just saying that Russia isn’t facing mass equipment losses due to the equipment being outdated; they’re suffering heavy equipment losses because of differences in doctrine, and the type of resistance they’re facing.

There are a limited number of ways you can move 25 kilos of a material 30-40km in a minute. 

Moving long distances under extremely hard acceleration limits the design of a device. Long wings or other structural elements that allow loiter time cannot handle those forces nor are they conducive to high speed flight. We have drones that can move that fast and carry that much but they need lots of space to take off and land. 

Sure if you had magical materials and ignored what we know about aerodynamics then a drone could replace artillery in function. It would need to be large enough to carry a 25 kilo payload and aerodynamic surfaces to allow loiter time and be magically strong enough to withstand the hundreds of G's of acceleration required to cover 30-40km in under a minute from an instantaneous launch. No runway/takeoff sequence. 

Then that whole system would need to magically be cheaper than an unguided steel shell.

I believe a full court press Manhattan project style effort could have made this possible 20-25 years ago, but it would have been staggeringly expensive during a period of time when it seemed like nuclear weapons threats were not expected to be a long term existential risk.

And while these weapons mitigated tanks, these people were wrong because of the need to aim these systems accurately, with well trained and disciplined troops. 

&gt;	Then the Israeli’s and the Soviet’s introduced their own respective Explosive reactive armour (ERA), this effectively made ATGM’s a non-issue.

ERA didn’t render ATGMs a non-issue, ERA just allowed the tank crew to survive in many instances, many instances where the tank itself was actually rendered combat ineffective by a combo of the ATGM and the ERA. And again, the ATGMs had to be aimed by well trained crews, for the ERA to even have to do its job. 

&gt;	the Soviet’s introduced heavy ERA, and eventually produced Shtora and Arena APS.

And the ERA blocked the new weapons but did render the tank ineffective in many instances. APSs that were basically never deployed, basically never worked when they were deployed, and are totally ineffective against modern ATGMs. 

&gt;	There’s always a need for infantry support that can fire heavy rounds and deal with enemy armour if need be.

Tanks have been ineffective against modern armies for decades.  As foretold at Debecka Pass. Manned systems will become less and less common, and therefore the need for heavy and expensive armor. The tanks don’t need infantry support when the Switchblade 600 can kill them and the infantry can’t do a thing about it. Or when fire and forget high AoA top attack ATGMs have defeated every tank and APS on the planet. We no longer need to aim the system, we train new recruits on the Jav in just a few hours and it’s getting lighter, cheaper and easier to use all the time.

First, you already have the necessary technology already in effective stages, it's a matter of assembling it and getting it orbital. 

You also have to realize that the denser the air / lower the altitude, the harder it is for lasers to maintain focus and avoid losses to dispersion. But in high altitude and especially above the mesosphere and past the Karman line, resistance becomes trivial to the point where range is *almost* no longer a factor provided precise enough optics. 

What this means is that time-on-target to cook off aligned threat elements is much less than you see in this video with low wattage, thick atmospheric elements at work. A sufficient orbital defense platform could conceivably blanket around 1/6th of the planet at once, and we must remember that aside from boomers, most ICBMs would be coming from Russia, North America, and China in the event of a full scale ICBM exchange. 

Given the stakes, and the abandonment of previous treaties and MAD doctine, it's not difficult to see where this would be given enough resources to get quite a lot of these defense installations operational. 

Older tech made this pretty much impossible to achieve for a number of reasons, chiefly the lack of true heavy lift capabilities, but also power systems, tracking tech, laser optics and chemical engineering, etc. Now, the pieces are in place, and with the latest unfortunate turns in global stability, this will rise rapidly through the priorities and join other programs towards fruition. When looking at the newest Aegis and THAAD projects, you can see a clear lineage towards goals of deprecating missile threats.
