Yes, and since then, the West illegally invaded at least four countries in violation of the UN Charter, destabilized an entire region and causing one of the worst migration crises in modern history. One of these countries that was invaded got hit so hard by numerous NATO Depleted Uranium bombs in 1999 that it now has one of the highest cancer rates in Europe. 

Currently, the US and EU are condemning the Afghan population to premeditated famine by seizing all the reserves of the Afghan Central Bank and refusing to grant development aid that was promised. Additionally, the US, UK and France are complicit in war crimes by assisting Saudi forces in Yemen which are using deliberate starvation of the civilian population as a war tactic.

So if we adopt your way of reasoning, it seems that it would be very difficult for China and the rest of the world to work together with the West on these global issues.

Their relationship is also great with other autocratic regimes like China and Russia. 

Even Japan and South Korea have extensive economic ties and positive diplomatic exchange, generally East Asian nations (JP, SK, CH) don’t care about policing the world as much as the Western world, they ignore foreign issues and cultural differences. They also depend heavily on Middle Eastern oil.

Japan even condemned Israel in the 1973 Arab oil embargo just to appease the Arab world even though they generally don’t care about anyone or anything outside their waters.

Even if China is under Xi who is delusional, it is simply so big and interconnected with the West and vice versa that to hurt China is literally to hurt the West. To hurt China's economy is to hurt America's economy hence the point of this article which states:

&gt; Biden and Xi, who initially showed no interest in a deal, would go along, the model predicted, in part, because so much of their attention was now focused on other issues and because a deal met their needs. In fact, Biden said earlier this month that he was weighing whether to ease the tariffs. In the game, as in real life, the leaders make compromises they didn’t expect to make.

So its absurd as A) if the US could not destroy China on the battlefield in North Korea in 1950, if it could not free Tibet or keep HK from Chinese annexation in the Cold War when China was a near failed state, how could it do it now when its so large and interconnected with the Western world? Like I said Trump tried and there is a reason why he failed. America is not the world. 

B) Your whole argument relies on this weird and extreme notion of offensive realism or some type of realism towards China. The irony of realism is like a person who wants to avoid taxes. Sure by avoiding taxes you save money and therefore preserve your self interests. But by doing so it weakens the State's ability to run necessary services which will ironically make you lose more money. So in your ideal world, the West will do everything it can to stop China to preserve its dominance, but Trump tried and it failed miserably as like I said, to do that is to destroy the West's own supply chains, own economies of scales, own factories, own investments, and with inflation going 10% in America and all around the world it clearly shows the shallowness of strict realism. The Athenians, Prussians and the Soviets were all practioners of the realism you speak of, and did any of them do well in the end? No they didn't their realism caused their own demise. 

Liberalism despite all its flaws shows us a world working together is in fact within the realist calculations of a state. China is not the Soviet Union, it can't just be sanctioned off, to sanction China off is like sanctioning the EU off as the EU could challenge American interests. To say the West did not benefit from working with China is also ignoring reality, look the price of your clothing, every day items, and imagine that x10 or even x50.

It should go without saying that the feasibility of repeating this process vis a vis China is simply not there. The scale of territory and population is on another order of magnitude, to say nothing of their possession of nuclear weapons.

If China is to be controlled, the most critical objective is first the absorption of Russia into the Western system. The war in Ukraine provides an opportunity in this regard, but there are certain challenges.

Firstly, war and subsequent occupation is off the table here too. Nuclear war prevents this option from being pursued. As such, the only way to bring Russia into the fold is to push it into collapse through a proxy war in Ukraine, as is being attempted. The issue is that an uncontrolled collapse is unpredictable. Should the Russian state lose the ability to control its own territory, there is every possibility that the eastern territories should fall into the orbit of Beijing. This remedy would be worse than the disease. It is of unparalleled importance that the territorial integrity of Russia be maintained, such that an eventually Western oriented Russia acts as the final encirclement of China to the north. 

It seems unlikely, to me, that the Han heartland itself could be dismembered and rendered pliable. Furthermore, short of an occupation and reconstitution of the Chinese state, I don’t believe that it will ever been compatible with the Western order. It’s hostility is not a function of elite sentiment, but of the popular sentiment. The people of China desire it to reclaim its position at the centre of the globe.

Regarding movement of out of china and their supposed unreliability, I'll believe it when I see it. As far as all this movement of industry is concerned, it seems exactly like expansion US industry to Germany and Japan, expansion of Japanese industry to Korea and China, etc. It seems like a normal economic decision to re locate and use comparative advantage. Lots of the moves to India are in order to expand into the Indian market and curry favor with government as they are adopting a more coherent industrial policy. 

China is no longer cheap labor central. It took 3 decades in a rapidly growing world to make Shenzen what it is. It's not going to change overnight. And especially in today's era - commodities are higher than ever, there's widespread economic issues, food shortages are going to hit pretty badly, hydrocarbons and energy prices are skyrocketing, against a backdrop of high inflation - this is not a world in which companies are going to engage in expansion and move out of comfortably existing locations. And it's even worse than 2008 because in 2008 China was rock solid. Now the zero covid has created a mess - and China is still comparatively in a great economic situation (which should scare everyone) . Europe is actively commiting economic suicide as we speak. America faces quite a bit of issues as well.

Biden is already removing the Chinese tariffs because let's face it, the American public is short sighted. They'll shout about China but unwilling to bear the costs and will vote out anyone who causes negative economic results.

How is this not the daftest thing I've read this week? Of course China would welcome a move that benefits them, when it's achieved at no cost to them. 

But if that's where we are, why would a new round of trade negotiations work? Wouldn't we again make a deal and see China not follow through on their end? Didn't we just show them that it doesn't matter if they renege on their commitments? 

Predictive models are valuable when they can be validated. China ""privately welcoming"" a gesture is about as unaccountable as it gets.

""U.S. President Joe Biden began his term determined to reverse his predecessor’s habit of cozying up to dictators, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. In February 2021, Biden pinned the blame for the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on MBS, declassifying a U.S. intelligence report that tied the assassination directly to him. Over a year later, however, it appears that the president plans to travel to Saudi Arabia in the first Middle East visit of his presidency. For those who saw Biden as a champion of human rights, it is a grave disappointment: rewarding MBS with a handshake and photo op on the crown prince’s home turf would amount to an admission that autocrats can get away with murdering their opponents, so long as they keep the oil flowing.  
But the problem is not just that a presidential visit to Riyadh would so obviously illustrate a compromise on principles. It is also that Biden probably will not gain anything meaningful in return. Help with domestic oil prices would be nice, but given the tight oil market in the midst of the Ukraine war, it’s not clear that the Saudis could do much even if they wanted to. A major breakthrough on the normalization of Israeli-Saudi ties does not appear to be in the offing, either. Nor is it realistic to expect that this trip could reverse the Saudis’ close relationships with both China and Russia. If he follows through on his plans to visit Riyadh, Biden will be making a bad deal: exchanging near-certain reputational damage for the mere possibility of modest triumphs. It is a visit that should never have been planned.""",fe9db6e7c5ca9e22d70ac10c91d14ac9cd539717,True,False,,,,,0,1654267655,,0,{},ib1je2d,True,t3_v410au,False,False,t3_v410au,/r/geopolitics/comments/v410au/bowing_to_the_prince_why_its_a_mistake_for_biden/ib1je2d/,1654267667,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654238855.0

Stating that China is the greatest challenge to the UN charter is a bit of a ""sky is blue"" moment. Certainly, they don't follow it when it doesn't match their interests; but neither do most other countries outside of maybe the EU and a few US Pacific allies. The US is, of course, a blatant violator. But we wouldn't say the US is the greatest threat to the UN charter just because it happens to be the most powerful country that defies it.

So no, I don't think the UN charter is equivalent to the rules based international order that the US is trying to protect. Rather, I'd say that the US's relationship with its European and Asia-Pacific allies is closer to the mark of what it wants to achieve with the rest of the world - a basic acceptance of US leadership and military hegemony, a commitment to not challenging the status quo, and a general agreement to ""play nice"" with each other. 

Unfortunately, such a relationship is, by its very definition, not likely to survive for long past the ""super power moment."" If there emerges an actor as powerful or more powerful than the US, that actor would have no rational reason to accept US supremacy or the status quo that has been built around reinforcing it. More so if its government system and culture are different from the US's, in which case it has even less reason to support the status quo.

With their comparable economic and military might, they will inevitably fall into strategic rivalry with the US over their own national priorities (even if they try for peaceful coexistence). Therefore, the US must preemptively deprive them of opportunities to create a multipolar order.

Contrast this with countries like Saudi Arabia. They're  a mess of human rights violations and authoritarian rule but that's forgivable because they're useful partners in countering Iran and have little intention of upsetting the US-dominated world order.

Not saying we should not use the narrative of democracy vs authoritarianism and press China on its human rights violations.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita is a rockstar in the geopolitical forecasting space. 
 His game theoretic forecasting model is used by the CIA, among others, to assess future power relations among international stakeholders.  The model considers stakeholders' influence, positions, negotiating flexibility and level of focus on issues to predict who is calling the shots and how they will exercise power.  By all counts, it's one of the most precisely calibrated out there.  For example, when the CIA ran it against historical datasets going back to the 1980s, the model's predictions were correct 89% of the time (outperforming the company's internal analysts, consistently).  

While past performance isn't necessarily an indicator of future results, the model now predicts a thaw in Sino-American relations.   Reducing inflation is among Biden's highest priorities.  Yellen is determined to relax tariffs, because they are having an inflationary impact and will likely influence Biden to slash tariffs on Chinese consumer goods.  The model forecast that Beijing will welcome the partial rollback and China would respond with further economic cooperation because doing so is in their interest.

&gt; Biden and Xi, who initially showed no interest in a deal, would go along, the model predicted, in part, because so much of their attention was now focused on other issues and because a deal met their needs. In fact, Biden said earlier this month that he was weighing whether to ease the tariffs. In the game, as in real life, the leaders make compromises they didn’t expect to make.",0ebfd0afabb812dd9f9fce57a6716da44bd9bb91,True,False,,,,,0,1654222662,,0,{},iazmcm0,True,t3_v3ooz1,False,True,t3_v3ooz1,/r/geopolitics/comments/v3ooz1/a_forecasting_model_used_by_the_cia_predicts_a/iazmcm0/,1654222672,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654193862.0
