Still vague, but a bit more concrete. I suppose the comments about ""cooperation in the field of defense industry"" might be interpreted as suggesting support for Finland's NATO bid, but it also mentions the lifting of ""obstacles to the export of military equipment to Turkey"", a matter which hasn't yet been resolved.

But not any other political party? only them? 

A much better political analysis would be to for instance claim that the social democrats have moved more towards the center.

Given that Sweden has elections coming up in September, I find it hard to imagine any party besides the Sweden democrats to go along with the current demands, because I honestly believe that majority of voters won't like it. 

Of course the same could be said about the whole NATO proposition, so we'll see which party wins the most by this decisio. The right wing block will of course claim that they have been advocating for Sweden to join NATO for about 20 years. It's quite possible that social democrat voters will find the change in policy ""flip-floppy"", like you said.

Personally I believe that Erdogan made those demands so that he would rally up domestic support. from what I've been reading lately, it seams his popularity has been declining for some time.

It makes sense when you think about it: once a country joins, you are committed to coming to their defense if they are attacked. Forever, unless you choose to leave NATO

That means the countries in NATO have every right (and should have every right) to veto a new member, because that’s a huge commitment to make and clearly a country shouldn’t be forced into it

The real question, to me, is whether NATO (and the EU, for that matter) should have mechanisms to remove countries that experience democratic and human rights “backsliding” - eg Hungary and Turkey, but I can’t imagine that would be used in this case because Turkey is an important NATO member state, and in any case if such a mechanism existed it should only be used in good faith, not just to remove a country who uses their veto",b5dda0d72a263bcf5d17a5a1f179f2415047b5b7,True,False,,,,,0,1652975988,,0,{},i97sgpe,False,t3_ut0ntb,False,True,t3_ut0ntb,/r/geopolitics/comments/ut0ntb/can_turkeys_veto_be_bypassed/i97sgpe/,1652976005,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652947188.0,

Yes, the PKK formed the PYD in 2003, and until around 2012 or so this connection remained very close. However, as I spoke about in the comment above, the groups started rapidly differentiating from 2012 onwards, and these days they are very different organisations in terms of their support bases, their political bodies/strugtures, their demographic makeup, and their organisational methods. There is a great wealth of writing on this, and I mentioned a book which I presume you have not read above. It's actually a free e-book, so you have no excuse not to read it.

Even as far back as 2013 this differentiation was occurring. Let me gives you an example. In 2013, the PKK wanted to remove Mazloum Abdi from the military leadership and replace him with Mahmoud Berkhadan, who was and still is closer to Qandil than Mazloum. Despite them even trying to summon Abdi to Qandil for this, the PYD alongside the PUK and the US refused to do so and convinced the PKK to drop the issue. These days the PKK doesn't even pretend it can choose who leads in the AANES because it simply doesn't have the strength to do so. Why would a 100,000+ strong security force and a complex governmental/state apparatus 
governing over 4-6 million people adhere to the wishes of an embattled militia of a couple thousand at most locked up in the Northern Iraqi mountains? There is just no logic behind it.

&gt;Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK)

The KCK isn't an executive body and has no central power over the groups within it. Of course, the PYD joined the KCK back when it was merely a PKK offshoot, and it had no reason to leave because they still share an ideology and an overall worldview. Almost all Kurds in the SDF, and the majority of Kurds in NE Syria, are sympathetic towards the PKK, so the PYD would lose support if it were to leave the KCK and speak strongly against the PKK.

1) Turkey is demanding Finland and Sweden (mainly Sweden) to cut ties with the AANES in North Syria (led by the PYD), which is a distinct entity from the PKK. They share an ideology and a history, but a great deal of research has gone into showing how the structures, organisations, goals, and methods of the PKK and PYD have differentiated rapidly since 2012. One example of this is *Accidental Allies* by Knights and van Wilgenburg. There are many others I'm happy to show.

2) Erdogan has repeatedly cited his desire for Sweden (and it really is Sweden more so than Finland) to crack down on Kurdish cultural expressions among Kurdish diaspora in Sweden (who are, in large, anti-Turkey, left-wing, and sympathetic towards the PKK, the Rojava Revolution, the HDP, and so on. This is evidenced in him citing Kurdish MPs as ""terrorists"" simply because they are open about their Kurdishness + their support for Kurdish self-determination. To nationalist Turks, all forms of Kurdish political identity not strictly loyal to Ankara (e.g., the KDP) are tantamount to existential security threats.

3) The timing and publicity of this block (pro-Erdogan media playing on it hard in Turkey) is specific to domestic politics. Elections are coming up soon in Turkey with early elections often hypothesised, and Erdogan is not looking like he will win. The Turkish economy has been in ever-worsening dire straits for a while now largely because of Erdogan's unwise interventions into monetary policy + the corruption surrounding the leadership of Turkish monetary institutions. It is a classic Erdogan ploy to stir up nationalist, anti-western, and/or anti-Kurdish sentiment during times of domestic trouble, and this is no exception. It's the same reason why he has been cracking down hard on the HDP lately.",6d5b63c0508d63e6d6adb2e1e3779b767933526c,True,False,,,,,0,1652967315,,0,{},i97832g,False,t3_ut0ntb,False,True,t1_i9722aw,/r/geopolitics/comments/ut0ntb/can_turkeys_veto_be_bypassed/i97832g/,1652967326,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652938515.0,

NATO is a military alliance who's foundation was based on the mutual agreement where all nation would defend each other in case they were attacked, this was mainly against the Soviet Union but can effectively be applied for any other country or entity that attacks them. The application of entering this fine organization is that all countries must unanimously agree for any given state to join, each country has a full right for a veto. This was infamously the case with Greece who's refused North Macedonian applications for many years due to their name, and now is  the case with Turkey who sees the active funding and support for YPG/PYD as an existential threat and their lax tolerance for PKK terrorist elements within their own state as unacceptable. An alliance such as NATO must be build on a common understanding and respect among each other, if Sweden and Finland refuse this then there entry is simply detrimental and pointless for Turkey as member. 

The IMF is an international financial funding institution that has absolutely no connection with NATO, a military alliance organization. Therefore it is not possible or even logical to try to get concession and money from an organization that has absolutely no connection or interest within NATO. That is why that makes absolutely no sense to get money or any other form of financial restitution from blocking the entry of a country into a military alliance.

China pretty much views Turkey as a rival for low cost manufacturing. China won't want to piss off Saudi Arabia - because of oil that China desperately needs. Turkey imports oil and is no help to China.

Russia is a poisoned chalice in the current environment, which is why Turkey is trying very hard to mediate an end to the war. Turkey is a great scapegoat for Germany to push for settlement. Germany cannot be seen (at least now) to NOT back Ukraine/NATO and having Turkey take the lead is something German businessmen and likely German politicians view as a useful tool.

That is why they went after Kyiv.  They literally tried to storm the Government Quarter of Kyiv twice in February 25th.  Putin's main aim was to get rid of Zelensky and reinstall Yanukovych as puppet dictator.  The entire war started with Maidan when Yanukovych was run out of town.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now that negotiations have broken down, he'll be required to sign off on an eventual Ukrainian surrender.

Why would Zelensky surrender?  He's winning.  Ukraine is getting tons of NATO weapons and has removed Russia from Kyiv and Kharkiv.  Russia is losing tons of men and is nowhere near controlling Donbas.  They'll be able to launch a counteroffensive to take back the land and at least force a status quo ante situation.  To ""force"" Zelensky to surrender (and then execute him and install a puppet government), Putin would need to capture him and we've already established he cannot do that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As for the second statement, surely you jest. Ukraine is the absolute biggest loser in this whole affair of any involved player. The country is getting destroyed by the day, their economy is in ruins and the Russians will be annexing all the resource rich and industrial land that counts (South and East Ukraine).

Ukraine is likely to take back its land on counteroffensives and force a status quo ante.  It'll be in the EU, have a NATO-level military, and be rebuilt through a Marshall Plan by the US/ EU.  It will emerge as a stronger country with a better government and a more unified society.  Russia will ideally be under sanctions that will prevent it from rebuilding its military.  The only reason why this won't happen is if the EU/ US go wobbly on sanctions and stop the military aid.",6e6203b2b33b1748ac38780bacd80e16a9fc4b4f,True,False,,,,,0,1652961309,,0,{},i96wqsl,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i96i59n,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i96wqsl/,1652961324,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652932509.0,

Well yes you actually can. In the case of Bosnia Srpska in it's own constitution made it illegal for itself to secede from Bosnia without the consent of The USA, Croatia, Serbia, and all parties in BiH. Also even if self-determinations to be non-discriminate that makes the case for Bosniak regions in eastern Srpska or Serbia to separate and join Bosnia/Federation which can get messy. self-determination is a messy thing which is respected by a minority of nation because every state has a good chunk of minorities of their own.

&gt;Bosnia is an anomaly that was given it's current shape by AH/Ottoman struggle in the Balkans and it was kept as such to keep the land easy to rule from the outside.

The same could be said for Montenegro, Croatia, and N.Macedonia all there borders are the result of the above and all have ethnicty mixed areas. The only difference was in BiH ethnicity was enshrined into every law/government position which causes issues.

I saw Bosnians telling Croatians they couldn’t wear Croatian symbols.  I’m sure Croatians would do the same but I didn’t see it.  I saw with my own eyes a Bosnian officer make the Croatians take off that checkered flag belt buckle they would wear. 

And the Croatian looked like he wanted to fight over it. 

The area I was in didn’t have Serbians but I remember seeing the flag once or twice.  In the town center. 

I then found out that Serbia has another region under there control but I never went there. 

I wanted to ask the soldiers who spoke English very well why they didn’t just have one flag but seeing how worked up people got over that stuff I decided not to.
