States would be levelling us to the ground in seconds, and nothing remotely like that would ever happen cause everyone knows that would happen.  

And the states lost some thousands to islamic terrorists, russia lost 20-27 million people during WWII while US lost like 300k and has never been invaded themselves, except by themselves.  States would be extra pissed if we invited china, or any other country according to the monroe doctrine, legally to help bolster national security.  Not that it would happen obviously cause Canada knows it would not be a pleasant experience.

No one would be charged with war crimes due to the American Service members Protection Act.  It is American policy to use any means neccessary and appropriate to ensure no US or allied soldiers or officials are tried under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  It prevents handing over evidence and extradition to the ICC.  In short, the US does not accept international standards of accountability for war crimes they have committed,  while simultaneously supporting their efforts against other countries.  Thus it shouldnt be a suprise to anyone when the Russians refuse to comply with the ICC, because US policy has made it perfectly clear that it does not apply universally.

US has a long history of not respecting the sovereignty of other nations, see Latin America.  It is why bananas are the cheapest fruit in America despite being imported.  And has laid the foundation for American Multinationals and thus the vast amounts of wealth possesed by the states.  So my problem is less with criticizing Russia and more regarding the exceptionalist nonsense while being completely ignorant to the American role in maintaining the political climate where this stuff happens, instead of promoting and strengthening institutions which could provide an avenue for universal justice in international politics.  

Israel had been getting US support for how long?  They justify their nonsensical 2000 year old reclaim casus belli, but they are no better than the russians, they are just not doing things to Europeans, considering that Donbas was owned by ukrainian cossacks and lost to turks, russia took donbas and crimea from turks, and the cossack hetmanate eventually eventually requested to be a subject of Russia because they were threatened by the Poles.  But when palestinans engage in urban warfare they are said to be using human shields and innocent people killed are written off as collateral damage.  Canadas largest weapons deal was made to saudi arabia who has been bombing civilians in yemen for a long time.  Saudis are not a democracy, so thats not what things are about.  Worst humanitarian crisis on earth for years and no international effort or attention other than picking a side and bombing the people they dont agree with.  

There needs to be cooperation between nations even if they fundamentally disagree or else we will never have any hope of finding peace on this planet.  It will also stall the liberal agenda everyone is pushing for as foreign threats leads to a more authoritarian agenda as it is viewed as neccessary to the survival of the state, i.e. during WWII.  This phenomenon can be observed in the EU.

,[],False,,VinnfordSansbury,,,[],,,,text,t2_bq6jf,False,False,"I have seen and heard things beyond the Dreamscape, in visions both waking and at the edge of life and in my darkest hours. Hidden factions among those who dwell with the Father for those that have sought their solace and their company for the weary and the valiant. Halls of intriguing creatures, alien and angelic, and sometimes in powerful yet caring forms, peaceful baths, warm fires, and strong drink. Riddles of life are answered there and a paltry minute can steady the soul from its worries for any challenge for years to come. But the last time I was there, I was told they did not expect me so soon, and yet, I was not denied the benefits of that mysterious lodge. I might not have known if these are but reassuring illusions or some glimpse of a place that seems a mix of Heaven and Valhalla's pleasures, save for the epiphanies that only come through the basking of absolute knowledge and peace and to look with unfettered eyes again at the world and see where favor lies. But who would believe me? If your soul does not seek adventure and justice by day and if your heart does not seek high affections and healing libations by night, then why would you have seen it? I cannot blame them for this. Who else has seen these draconic Valkyrie? These reptilian angels in maidens' garbs with foaming steins, their halos and wings aglow in unexpected holy lights; they would be misunderstood. Who else can bear to witness their mightiest mortal translation in to such images we have long saved for relating to sin and the slay-worthy? Perhaps few are ready for such gnostic insight. Perhaps it is their hidden weapon against the greatest evils. But I believe only those who are haunted by the worst of monsters need such consolation that more fearsome and lovely spirits yet champion their cause. For the eagle's wings can only raise you up, but once you are there, feathers fail and ancient scales will shield you from the weight of fiendish devices.

&gt; The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.When Russia unleashed its invasion Feb. 24 in Europe&amp;#039;s biggest offensive since World War II and brandished the prospect of nuclear escalation if the West intervened, a swift toppling of Ukraine&amp;#039;s democratically elected government seemed likely.

&gt; The war&amp;#039;s economic and geopolitical shockwaves - with soaring energy prices, fears for global food supplies, and Russia and China aligning in a new world order with Cold War echoes - have reverberated across a planet yet to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.

&gt; Russia wants to &amp;quot;Get rid of the military potential of Ukraine&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ensure that Ukraine changes from an anti-Russian center to a neutral country,&amp;quot; Peskov said.

The whole story is told in comic, sarcastic ways like South Park. Lots of masterpiece jokes that despises the war and president.


Masyanya (wife) comes home to find out someone is sleeping in their bedroom. Husband tell her he gave their Ukranian friend (Lokhmatiy - 'Hairy',, last name Lokhmatenko) Lots of Tequila so he won't find out that Russia attacked Ukraniane because he has family there. He says that Lokhmatiy ha shears condition and it will kill him. He also says that friend's family is ok and in Poland now.

Husband urges Masyanya not to tell Lokhmatiy anything. They removed him from Internet,  took his phone, no TV, won't let him go to work because of covid, tried to infect him with covid (which Masyanya was scolding her husband that he is stupid just like their czar-president), finally they put sticker on the thermometer and hid Lokhmatiy's glasses.

They go outside on the balcony to smoke (which Masyanya didn't do before, but there is another joke about the times they live in). Husband tells her that everything is really very bad, thousands are killed, war is raging, 'cleansing' from traitors is gonna start soon.

Masyanya tell her husband good bye and take care of their kids and goes to Moscow. There she sees lots of pro-war and glorifying of the president and Z. She comes to the president's place. Tells the quards that she wants to see the president, she has a present for him from all the humans.

Meanwhile Ukranian friend demands explanation and husband telling him truth. Lokhmatiy is devastated, shocked.  Husband builds him a hiding place, there is a comparison - like Anne Frank.

While sending kids to school and telling them not to tell they hide anyone (joke here) from 'not a real nation' the special forces raid their house. Someone told on them. The ringer on Ukranian friend's phone comes off ....

In Moscow - guards jokingly tell Masyanya they will go for a smoke break. Masyanya looking for the president.  There is a whole convo between them, jokes exchanged,  they are clever and a lot of Russian culture digging, like there is a dig at one movie song that president quotes - 'who helps people, wasting time, doing good one won't be famous'.... finally Masyanya tells him he has only one choice left - gives him Japanese sword.

She returnes home,  husband and Lokhmatiy meet her quietly, looking stunned.  They joke she must have no battery in her phone and missed everything. Husband tells her about the president. Masyanya pretends she has nothing to do with it ....


Lots of jokes in there that Russians understand and very accurate description of the situation as on local and government level.

Sorry for grammar and other mistakes. English is not my first language.  Sadly Ruscommitting.

So glad I'm not a part of them for a long-long time. I left during Eltsin times. It is very said how the whole country was brainwashed by Putin's propaganda for two decades. It caused rift in my family. I can't talk to them anymore. I hope they wake up finally and see this crime against humanity their leaders and they  themselves are comitting.

&gt;Russian troops occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have ""looted and destroyed"" a laboratory at the site, Ukrainian officials claim.
&gt;
The State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said the Russians had damaged their Central Analytical Labratory - which processed a lot of radioactive waste.
&gt;
&gt;[The state agency said in a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/dazv.gov.ua/posts/340693271429994) that the laboratory had ""highly active samples and samples of radionuclides, which today are in the hands of the enemy"".
&gt;
&gt;The lab, which cost about six million euros to set up, had also contained ""valuable analytical equipment"" that were not available elsewhere in Europe, the agency said.
&gt;
Chernobyl - the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986 - is not a working power station but still requires constant management.
&gt;
&gt;The Russians captured it in the first few days of the war last month, and had kept workers there for weeks before some were released.
&gt;
&gt;The former nuclear site remains a great concern, and earlier this week Ukraine's parliament reported that forest fires had erupted in the vicinity of the plant, which were picked up in satellite images.",c16f0b4201e2c670acfbf10f47e99d3759522cd5,True,False,,,,,0,1648034018,,0,{},i1s482h,True,t3_tkrihu,False,True,t3_tkrihu,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tkrihu/russians_have_destroyed_chernobyl_lab_says_ukraine/i1s482h/,1648034030,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648005218.0,,,,

&gt;At 05:00 GMT, 07:00 local time, residents cautiously emerged from mostly being underground in basements or bunkers.
&gt;
&gt;They emerged to possibly one of the noisiest mornings since the start of this invasion – to the sound of more sustained heavy artillery. It seemed to come from the north-west, a constant rattle of small arms fire for more than half an hour.
&gt;
&gt;And it seems to be closer. We're getting reports the Russian army is shelling two districts in the north-west of Kyiv. The initial reports are that private houses, residential apartment blocks and a mall are damaged.
&gt;
&gt;So late last night the narrative was that the Ukrainian forces were counter-attacking, that they’d raised the flag in Makariv, which is about 40 miles west of Kyiv.
&gt;
&gt;We heard from London and Washington that the advance on the capital, which is still regarded as one of President Putin's aims, had been stalled again. And then you wake up and you hear something different.
&gt;
&gt;This is the reality of the war that began fought on multiple fronts for the past month.

,[],False,,JimMarch,,,[],,,,text,t2_311fc,False,False,"It wasn't just you guys, Britain got taken over by...well descendants of Vikings anyway.  William the conqueror was from an area of what's now France that was taken over by Vikings hundreds of years earlier.  Took over England in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings.

By then William and his nobles spoke French and there's a whole bunch of French words that slipped into English that way. Like, we have the words meat and beef, and the word beef is the version with a French origin.

The big difference is, a technological change happened in England.  They invented the longbow, originally from Wales.  First cheap weapon that could take out an armored nobleman at 200 meters.

In 1297 King John signed the Magna Carta, an agreement under which the king himself would be subject to the laws of the land.  It was the start of a whole series of changes in how government would be handled - the origin of the entire concept of ""civil rights"".  He signed it because there were 10,000 longbowmen outside ready to turn his ass into a human pin cushion if he didn't.

*Good government in England started the first time commoners could confront an armed nobleman and kick his ass if necessary.*

Similar concepts took hold in Switzerland because they figured out the crossbow which was able to do the same thing.

You and your ancestors do not come from cultures where that kind of parity ever happened.  Now Russia is ruled by literal gangsters.  You made a start at ending gang rule in 2014 I'm Ukraine which was awesome but you still didn't figure out the need for a balance of real power between the people and the government.

Had you done so in 2014 Putin would never have invaded if he knew he would have faced at least 4 million Ukrainian civilians with guns already in hand that they knew how to use.  Even if those guns were ""only"" semi-auto.  (Full auto is overrated - a semi-auto with good sights is way better then a fully auto rifle with shit sights like what all the Russian invaders have, with the exception of a few Chechens.)

That's what he would face if he attacks the Finns, Czechs or most of the Baltic states.

Of course, we're talking about a period before the split between Ukraine and Russia when the capital of what's now the Russian culture was Kiev.

https://www.history.com/news/vikings-in-russia-kiev-rus-varangians-prince-oleg

&gt;It was after 840 that Scandanavian Vikings—who were known in Eastern Europe as “Varangians” or “Rus”—established Viking rule over Slavic tribes in what came to be called Kievan Rus. At first, the region was divided between three noble brothers.
&gt;
&gt;“The oldest, Rurik, located himself at Novgorod; the second, Sineus, at Beloozero; and the third, Truvor, in Izborsk,” recounts the Russian Primary Chronicle, a history of the region completed in the 12th century by Kievan monks. “On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus.” (“Rus,” which is where the name “Russia” comes from, purportedly derives from an old Nordic word for “men who row.”)

Yes, the first organized government of anything like we can call Russia we're a bunch of fucking Vikings.

First decent government any of you have had in the thousand plus years since is Zelenskyy.  And when you finally kicked enough Russian ass that they wander home with whatever is left of their logistics, you're going to have to politely and firmly tell Zelenskyy you're not giving up your guns ever again.

Big if right there.

If he's willing to use chemical weapons on a large scale against cities, he might win but at a terrible cost to the Russian economy. If you think it's bad now, and yes it is, wait until China and India will have nothing to do with him and Western Europe shuts off the gas pipe lines and struggles to do without Russian gas.

Beau had some interesting comments on this, first regarding what Russia is trying in Mariupol and why fighting on for a basically destroyed city is necessary from the Ukraine point of view:

https://youtu.be/Wi_kDPvDs9Q

The TL;DR is that the Ukrainians cannot allow Putin to win in that city because if he does, he will use exactly the same technique in Odessa next and Kiyv not long after that.  Plus the fighting there ties up Russians; abandon the fight there and those Russians move on elsewhere.
