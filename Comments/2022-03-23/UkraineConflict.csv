The whole story is told in comic, sarcastic ways like South Park. Lots of masterpiece jokes that despises the war and president.


Masyanya (wife) comes home to find out someone is sleeping in their bedroom. Husband tell her he gave their Ukranian friend (Lokhmatiy - 'Hairy',, last name Lokhmatenko) Lots of Tequila so he won't find out that Russia attacked Ukraniane because he has family there. He says that Lokhmatiy ha shears condition and it will kill him. He also says that friend's family is ok and in Poland now.

Husband urges Masyanya not to tell Lokhmatiy anything. They removed him from Internet,  took his phone, no TV, won't let him go to work because of covid, tried to infect him with covid (which Masyanya was scolding her husband that he is stupid just like their czar-president), finally they put sticker on the thermometer and hid Lokhmatiy's glasses.

They go outside on the balcony to smoke (which Masyanya didn't do before, but there is another joke about the times they live in). Husband tells her that everything is really very bad, thousands are killed, war is raging, 'cleansing' from traitors is gonna start soon.

Masyanya tell her husband good bye and take care of their kids and goes to Moscow. There she sees lots of pro-war and glorifying of the president and Z. She comes to the president's place. Tells the quards that she wants to see the president, she has a present for him from all the humans.

Meanwhile Ukranian friend demands explanation and husband telling him truth. Lokhmatiy is devastated, shocked.  Husband builds him a hiding place, there is a comparison - like Anne Frank.

While sending kids to school and telling them not to tell they hide anyone (joke here) from 'not a real nation' the special forces raid their house. Someone told on them. The ringer on Ukranian friend's phone comes off ....

In Moscow - guards jokingly tell Masyanya they will go for a smoke break. Masyanya looking for the president.  There is a whole convo between them, jokes exchanged,  they are clever and a lot of Russian culture digging, like there is a dig at one movie song that president quotes - 'who helps people, wasting time, doing good one won't be famous'.... finally Masyanya tells him he has only one choice left - gives him Japanese sword.

She returnes home,  husband and Lokhmatiy meet her quietly, looking stunned.  They joke she must have no battery in her phone and missed everything. Husband tells her about the president. Masyanya pretends she has nothing to do with it ....


Lots of jokes in there that Russians understand and very accurate description of the situation as on local and government level.

Sorry for grammar and other mistakes. English is not my first language.  Sadly Ruscommitting.

So glad I'm not a part of them for a long-long time. I left during Eltsin times. It is very said how the whole country was brainwashed by Putin's propaganda for two decades. It caused rift in my family. I can't talk to them anymore. I hope they wake up finally and see this crime against humanity their leaders and they  themselves are comitting.

You know what we call 18,000 rifles in America?  One halfway decent gun show.  Twice a year around any major city they'll rent a huge auditorium and turn it into this:

That's less than a quarter of any decent one - basically a gigantic flea market for guns, accessories, parts, beef jerky (don't ask, kind of a tradition...).

You guys should have had access to stuff like this at least since about 2015.  Instead you had to rush at the last minute.  You had to hand out lots of rifles that didn't have scopes or flashlights or any other necessary toys.

&gt;Russian troops occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have ""looted and destroyed"" a laboratory at the site, Ukrainian officials claim.

The State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said the Russians had damaged their Central Analytical Labratory - which processed a lot of radioactive waste.
&gt;
&gt;[The state agency said in a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/dazv.gov.ua/posts/340693271429994) that the laboratory had ""highly active samples and samples of radionuclides, which today are in the hands of the enemy"".
&gt;
&gt;The lab, which cost about six million euros to set up, had also contained ""valuable analytical equipment"" that were not available elsewhere in Europe, the agency said.
&gt;
Chernobyl - the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986 - is not a working power station but still requires constant management.
&gt;
&gt;The Russians captured it in the first few days of the war last month, and had kept workers there for weeks before some were released.

[],False,,JimMarch,,,[],,,,text,t2_311fc,False,False,"It wasn't just you guys, Britain got taken over by...well descendants of Vikings anyway.  William the conqueror was from an area of what's now France that was taken over by Vikings hundreds of years earlier.  Took over England in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings.

By then William and his nobles spoke French and there's a whole bunch of French words that slipped into English that way. Like, we have the words meat and beef, and the word beef is the version with a French origin.

The big difference is, a technological change happened in England.  They invented the longbow, originally from Wales.  First cheap weapon that could take out an armored nobleman at 200 meters.

In 1297 King John signed the Magna Carta, an agreement under which the king himself would be subject to the laws of the land.  It was the start of a whole series of changes in how government would be handled - the origin of the entire concept of ""civil rights"".  He signed it because there were 10,000 longbowmen outside ready to turn his ass into a human pin cushion if he didn't.

*Good government in England started the first time commoners could confront an armed nobleman and kick his ass if necessary.*

Similar concepts took hold in Switzerland because they figured out the crossbow which was able to do the same thing.

You and your ancestors do not come from cultures where that kind of parity ever happened.  Now Russia is ruled by literal gangsters.  You made a start at ending gang rule in 2014 I'm Ukraine which was awesome but you still didn't figure out the need for a balance of real power between the people and the government.

Had you done so in 2014 Putin would never have invaded if he knew he would have faced at least 4 million Ukrainian civilians with guns already in hand that they knew how to use.  Even if those guns were ""only"" semi-auto.  (Full auto is overrated - a semi-auto with good sights is way better then a fully auto rifle with shit sights like what all the Russian invaders have, with the exception of a few Chechens.)

That's what he would face if he attacks the Finns, Czechs or most of the Baltic states.

Of course, we're talking about a period before the split between Ukraine and Russia when the capital of what's now the Russian culture was Kiev.

https://www.history.com/news/vikings-in-russia-kiev-rus-varangians-prince-oleg

&gt;It was after 840 that Scandanavian Vikings—who were known in Eastern Europe as “Varangians” or “Rus”—established Viking rule over Slavic tribes in what came to be called Kievan Rus. At first, the region was divided between three noble brothers.
&gt;
&gt;“The oldest, Rurik, located himself at Novgorod; the second, Sineus, at Beloozero; and the third, Truvor, in Izborsk,” recounts the Russian Primary Chronicle, a history of the region completed in the 12th century by Kievan monks. “On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus.” (“Rus,” which is where the name “Russia” comes from, purportedly derives from an old Nordic word for “men who row.”)

Yes, the first organized government of anything like we can call Russia we're a bunch of fucking Vikings.

First decent government any of you have had in the thousand plus years since is Zelenskyy.  And when you finally kicked enough Russian ass that they wander home with whatever is left of their logistics, you're going to have to politely and firmly tell Zelenskyy you're not giving up your guns ever again.

Big if right there.

If he's willing to use chemical weapons on a large scale against cities, he might win but at a terrible cost to the Russian economy. If you think it's bad now, and yes it is, wait until China and India will have nothing to do with him and Western Europe shuts off the gas pipe lines and struggles to do without Russian gas.

Beau had some interesting comments on this, first regarding what Russia is trying in Mariupol and why fighting on for a basically destroyed city is necessary from the Ukraine point of view:

https://youtu.be/Wi_kDPvDs9Q

The TL;DR is that the Ukrainians cannot allow Putin to win in that city because if he does, he will use exactly the same technique in Odessa next and Kiyv not long after that.  Plus the fighting there ties up Russians; abandon the fight there and those Russians move on elsewhere.

Beau had another even more important video sometime back:

4. Ukrainian antitank teams to operate with impunity, including rear areas, because Russia hasn’t been able to secure captured territory

5. Russia has been unable to encircle and/or seize a single major city

6.

7. Russia has been unable to fully suppress the Ukrainian Air Force

8. The Russians are digging in west of Kyiv, digging trenches. This indicates the Russian forces committed thus far are spent and unable to sustain an advance

Ukraine has not yet been able to push the Russians back, aside from small areas. They have, however, been able to fight the Russians to a standstill and limited their territorial gains significantly.

I am from Copenhagen, Denmark. Danish leadership has pretty much already sold us out to chinese and russian money, so politically Denmark has a better survival chance if we become a state in Germany. 

When it comes to tourism, Germany has a lot more to offer than Denmark, except for beaches. 

A lot of Germany has so much beautiful nature and architecture to offer. If you want to see really old stuff, look into ""Rothenburg ob der Tauber"". That is definitely an experience I can recommend. 

Germany has the most numerous participation in the practice of being naked for the sake of being naked. So if being naked just for the sake of being naked is something you would be into, look into areas with ""freikorperkultur"" locations. 

Germany has awesome festivals, everything from heavy music festivals to medieval reenactment festivals. If you get a chance to see the band ""Heilung"" at a German festival, I definitely recommend that you grab that chance. 

If visiting Denmark, only Copenhagen is worth it. The rest of the country is industrialised farmland and not really worth touring. Copenhagen is a beautiful city though and ofc. Denmark is the place to be if you want to enjoy beaches and ocean swimming. 

If you visit Copenhagen and want to look at historical stuff, I recommend ""Gefion fountain"". It is a stroll away from the little mermaid but many people who go to see the famous little mermaid unfortunately miss the most more interesting fountain nearby. 

If visiting anywhere in Denmark, be sure to to frequent the bakeries and patisseries. The quality of baked goods and pastries here is delicious.",873478963db28238045291ee744e4cd325f1f0f1,True,False,,,,,0,1647977560,,0,{},i1p8sl9,False,t3_tk7122,False,True,t1_i1p39nv,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tk7122/right_but_of_course_putin_will_keep_going_moldova/i1p8sl9/,1647977573,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647948760.0,

Russia trains their military to shoot, reload and throw grenades. Basics. Entry teams are robotic and timid. Urban logistics planning is a fat 0, and execution of Urban assault? Failure after failure.

All Russia can do is launch missiles and turn buildings into rubble. All of these attacks on the Civilian Infrastructure is to soften Ukrainian fighters from having any cover to attack tanks and infantry.

They know tall buildings are perfect for NLaw or Jav attacks. High perch situations are deadly against armor, and Russia is trying to weaken any infrastructural advantages that Ukrainian fighters can use.

Russia can't win this, unless they turn the entire country into rubble and this scorched earth approach is alive and well in the darkest hearts of Russian politics.
