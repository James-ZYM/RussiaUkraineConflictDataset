[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"&gt;No, they are not going to kill me. That's why Israel is a necessity.

One doesn't follow from the other. American Jews are no more at risk than Israeli Jews of being killed by the Houthis.

&gt;They want to and you see no problem with that.

There's no indication that the Houthis plan to kill you, nor any other Jewish citizen of Israel for that matter. Indeed, the Houthis haven't even massacred the last 50 or so Yemeni Jews still in-country - albeit they have [abused them in various ways](https://www.yemenembassy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Houthi-Ideology.pdf).

&gt;But I take great comfort in your hope that they don't want to kill every Jew.

You shouldn't. You should instead take comfort, in order of importance, in: (1) the overall international correlation of forces, (2) the fact that slogans rarely translate directly into policies and (3) that the Houthis haven't, in fact, called for murdering every Jew.

&gt;So where should I send money to help them in their efforts?

You shouldn't finance the Houthis. You can, however, donate to help the Yemeni IDPs/refugees, for instance through [the UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/yemen-emergency.html).

&gt;You seem to think that Khamenei is an honorable man.

Khamenei is the authoritarian leader of Iran. That doesn't mean he's lying on that specific point - or even that he's lying all that much, in general, when he discusses foreign policy.

&gt;And that he doesn't want to kill all Americans. As for us Jews, that's not really important is it?

The death of all/one Jew(s) is as important as the death of all/one American(s) - some of whom are Jewish themselves. The unfounded fear that all Jews - or all Americans - will die is less important than the [actual deaths of 377,000+ Yemenis](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423).

&gt;Wow, it is just baseline antisemitism. Again, such a relief. They don't want to kill me more than other people want to kill me.

Antisemitism doesn't necessarily lead to genocidal intent. Just like anti-Islamism doesn't necessarily mean that one wants to exterminate all Muslims, or that anti-black racism means that one wants to exterminate, or even murder individual, black persons.

For instance, Yemeni Jews under Houthi control are marginalized and appear to have had their properties taken from them with some regularity. But they haven't been massacred.

Racism is wrong, but it's not automatically genocidal.

&gt;Again, you said you saw no problem with the slogan. I'm talking about that.

I did. I will even repeat it: I see no problem with their slogan.

&gt;You support one side fully, I'm talking about that.

Quite a reach there. I see no problem with their slogan not because I support the Houthis on a philosophical level, but because it's just one variation of the rote Shia Islamist slogan born from the Iranian revolution. It is to be expected, and ultimately doesn't mean much.

If I were dealing in bad faith, I'd accuse you of supporting the murder of 377,000+ Yemenis because of your unfounded fear of a second Judeocide. But of course I assume that you don't support their deaths.

You ought to extend me the same courtesy.",9ab7cff07fe6951da8c71e24faecd078afe73456,True,False,,,,,0,1648079876,,0,{},i1v7et8,False,t3_tjlix2,False,True,t1_i1v1wq9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjlix2/when_would_the_russian_force_in_ukraine_be/i1v7et8/,1648079892,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648051076.0,

I wasn't saying that aid would stop, but there has been a staggering amount of aid provided to Ukraine from the West in a very short amount of time. And while I'm not expert on foreign aid, my understanding is that much of the foreign aid that's given (especially by the US) is earmarked in such a way that ensures much of the spending flows back into that country's industries. Israel for example gets huge amount of aid from the US, but then turns around and uses much of that aid to buy weapons etc from the US military industrial complex.

There have been many reports that the US is providing near real-time intelligence. The US IC has vast resources. Now combine that with the amateur hour comms security by Russia. Ukraine is likely continuously receiving actionable intelligence. They may not be able to act on every piece of information, but I imagine the US IC is also helping them get a clearer picture of the effectiveness of attacks, in turn allowing Ukraine to be much more efficient. 


- Ukrainians will not support a surrender. The Ukrainian and US propaganda machine is running well and fomenting (much deserved) hate towards Russia.

If we're thinking about a situation where the US unilaterally fancies knocking over the NK leadership, one sunny afternoon, then sure, nobody's going to risk doing that out of the blue if NK have a hundred nukes, a dozen, or one. In that sense, one nuke is ""enough"". Though I suppose we ought to note that nobody invaded NK in the 50 or 60 years where they did not possess a nuclear deterrent, either. And that NK, despite the enormous costs, has pursued more than one credible weapon for *some* reason.

Part of that must be paranoia for the continuation of your regime, part of it must be prestige, but part of it is presumably a desire to act, and throw your weight around, more freely than you felt able to before you had your nuclear safety net.

After all, what about when the stakes are higher than mere US adventurism? At some point the vast machinery of the US is going to be able to assess that it has a *reasonable* confidence in destroying your one weapon on the ground before it launches and a low (but existent) confidence of intercepting it in the air. Not to mention a low confidence that it simply may not work.

And at some point the downsides of your behaviour might start to outweigh that risk. You'd have to be up to something pretty serious, but if you were to (say) invade SK, or bombard Seoul, that might do it. But with a hundred credible weapons it might not.

From another angle - if we imagine Ukraine today, but imagine that Putin only has a single nuke at his disposal, and forget our risk assessments for a minute. Would NATO really believe that Putin would risk his trump card merely to deter NATO from allowing Ukrainian aviation to base in Poland for example? Or offer more overt support or safe havens inside western Ukraine?

And this is an area where the Russians do, kind of, have a point. Crimea really was closer to Russia than to Ukraine historically, and its current status as part of Ukraine is due, in part, to administrative moves in the Soviet Union that weren't intended to express a deeper view on what nation Crimea ""belongs"" to. That's not to excuse Russia seizing Crimea by military force, just to explain why Crimea is a bigger issue for Russia than the republics.

Practically speaking, the Russian government - *any* plausible Russian government, at this point - would rather keep fighting and bleeding than return Crimea. Returning Crimea would be seen as a defeat on the scale of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and Russia's situation would need to be comparable to 1917 to accept it.

Russia is, (1) not really a military threat to NATO that needs wearing down, and (2) the west has a lot of deep economic ties to Russia, and the sanctions are very bad for business. Let's look at Germany, for example.

Germany, like the rest of NATO, had figured Putin to be a strongman who likes to throw his weight around, but wouldn't actually do anything dramatic. They have been basing their military, economic, and political relationships on that assumption for the last 20 years. Now that their assumption is clearly faulty, they're scrambling to re-adjust to their new reality, and it's a very painful process. 

On the energy front, Germany gets 25% of its energy from Russian gas pipelines. Getting cut off by Russia or being forced to turn off the tap by the rest of Europe would be a huge pain in the ass for a country that has made shutting down its nuclear plants to be a point of pride. 

Politically, Germany's government is currently a Social Democrat/Green coalition. The last time these two won a national election, they ran on a platform of peace and diplomacy . . . only for 9/11 to happen, which drug Germany into 20 years of war in the middle east. It's taken 20 years for the Greens to recover from that betrayal of their election promise. Now, these two parties are *again* forced to oversee a massive military about-face. If this goes badly, they'll be un-electable for another 20 years. 

On the military side of things, Germany, which as a country hates anything having to do with the military, just pledged an extra 100 *billion* euros to fix their rather dilapidated military. This is money that damn near everyone would rather spend elsewhere, but Germany now desperately needs a competent fighting force. It doesn't help that German society has a very troubled relationship with their military — something the government is now going to have to battle against in their efforts to revamp their army. 

And as the cherry on top, this war has shown that Russia really doesn't pose a military threat to NATO. But, it's also shown that Putin can't be trusted to act rationally. If force and detterence is the only language that Putin will understand, then it's the language that the west has to connivingly speak, lest things get worse.

Even assuming such a tunnel already existed, and its existence was known but precise location kept secret, an encircling Russian force could just set geophones around Kyiv to detect vehicle movement through the tunnel and then dig down to it to sever the connection to Poland.

Kyiv could perhaps avoid that with a maglev train inside a Faraday-shielded tunnel. In this case, an encircling Russian force could just dig a big trench that would be perpendicular to such a route until they find the tunnel.

Ukraine could perhaps make that challenging by making it go very deep through hard rock near Kyiv. In this case, the easier strategy for Russia might be to set off underground charges and watch for echoes to find the tunnel.

Uh no one is pretending otherwise. The sanctions really are absolutely crippling. There's a reason why Russia still won't open its stock exchange and why the value of the ruble has been cut in half since the invasion, even with their Central Bank desperately trying to keep it from collapsing further.  

&gt;A few confiscated yachts and closing McDonalds are very much in line with the appeasement response Russia expect

This is a hilariously simplistic understanding of the sanctions. The sanctions have frozen most of Russia's Central Bank's assets preventing it from utilizing $400b to prop up its economy. Most Russian banks are locked out of SWIFT and as a result can't seek loans from foreign lenders and are essentially blocked off from the global banking system altogether. Advanced technologies are prohibited from being traded to Russia and Russia has zero ability to replace or produce those goods, perhaps most critically computer chips. Russian airlines not only can't travel to most of the world, they can't get their planes serviced anymore meaning they have a few months before being shuttered indefinitely. Thousands of foreign companies have stopped doing business in/with Russia (including the biggest global shipping firms in the world) causing a logistical nightmare that will force countless Russian companies to close down forever. Many Russian manufacturers use software from Western countries that are now shut down, meaning they will have to try to find replacements that will take months. Even Russian oil and gas will no longer have access to companies like Haliburton that provide technical knowledge on how to run rigs and where to build new wells. 

In short, it's a fucking catastrophe. Putin undid 30 years of economic integration with the West with the stroke of a pen and it will likely cause a Great Depression level economic downturn. 

Cutting off oil and gas altogether will help choke Russia's economy further, but you're very much mistaken if you think that alone will keep Russia's economy afloat.",c902b28bfc4c8ea9e68681f7279ea554d14dbaac,True,False,,,,,0,1648064918,,0,{},i1u670u,False,t3_tksxtx,False,False,t1_i1u3ooq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tksxtx/ukraine_megathread_march_23/i1u670u/,1648064934,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648036118.0,

We'll skip ""don't invade"" because that's obvious.

1. Actually have Complex Air Operations to obtain air superiority very quickly. No further than day 3, day 1 ideally. This would necessitate training their pilots better than they do.
2. Choose a better time to invade, when the ground wasn't a muddy mess. Russia of all countries should have known why.
3. Reduce the frontage, or at least the concentrations for them. Ukraine is not going to invade you, you are invading Ukraine. Having 4 major battlegrounds while it looks great on the map, is not actually great because you're trying to do too much with too little. Some deception might be necessary to maximize effects.
4. Actually prepare your army for invasion. The grunt doesn't necessarily need to do know the entire plan, but they definitely need to know they're not going into Ukraine for a training exercise. That's insanely stupid. Your army should be going in with the expectation that they're fighting a war. This perhaps requires a strong propaganda push to properly motivate the troops. But it's better than what they did.
5. Before the war, properly maintain their vehicles and equipment. Possibly even use far less if it means your force is more maneuverable.
6. On the subject of tanks, use scouting and reconnaissance to seek out potential AT positions and plan accordingly. Russia too many times rolled tanks into giant AT death traps. Tanks are gonna die, yes, that's just how it is, but they could lose far less. In addition, pairing infantry with tanks to support each other offers an individual tactical flexibility that they don't get when they're just on their own.
7. Properly train their forces in general. Either a professional volunteer army, or a much longer conscription term with more training.
8. Not have rampant corruption.
9. Reduce the size of their nuclear stockpile. This probably wouldn't make Russian politicians feel very good, but they have a 60 billion US dollar budget equivalent for their military in general. No small amount of that is upkeep for a stockpile that will, assuming enough rational actors are involved with everything, will never be used.
10. Plan logistics around the necessities as they arise. 
11. Not siege these cities. Urban warfare is hard, but just shelling these places with the expectation that enough shellfire will win you the city is erroneous. You still have to take these places after you've bombed it out, and it'd be easy for troops to just find basements and crevices where damage from shellfire avoids wiping out their defending force. The most I'd bring is 81mm mortars and grenades/grenade launchers to deal with specific hard points. Not sure how armor would fit into this, but certainly don't march columns into cities, and keep it protected from vulnerabilities.  This is both tactically sound and looks better on the international stage than just willy-nilly shooting at the city with the biggest stuff you have. It also won't galvanize the population against you more than you're going to with the invasion. Artillery is great as a support arm. Use it with that in mind.
12. Don't waste your VDV. They can do some good if they aren't dropped into areas without any semblance of support.

Some of these could be solved in a few years. Some of these would require a decade at least.

But if all of this advice was followed, it's possible Russia would be fighting heavily in Kyiv right now. Maybe even taking the city by this point. If their forces had been primarily concentrated around Crimea and near Kyiv (like 90% of troops concentrated in these pincers, and maybe the other 10 percent acting as distraction), this war would look very different.

Whether they could win the war, I don't know.

Literally all of them.

They took a huge punch to the gut, but now they're recovering and starting to fight how they train to fight. The issue is, they lost so much momentum and so much equipment, it may be too late for Russia to score a decisive blow to get the concessions they want.

Then I suggest you seriously revise your sources. I follow both Russian and Ukrainian sources on Telegram. There is no news on Кривой Рог since 03/20 because there haven't been serious clashes in that direction. Most likely Russian forces still haven't reached the defensive lines established in that direction. 

&gt;Ukrainian forces conducted successful localized counterattacks northwest of Kyiv. Russian forces in northeastern Ukraine did not conduct any offensive operations in the past 24 hours. Ukrainian forces repelled several Russian assaults in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the past 24 hours. Russian forces continue to make slow but steady progress reducing the Mariupol pocket.

Institute of War is a good source, but I don't know why you're willfully mis-interpreting their report to paint a rose-colored picture of the situation. 

Here's the section on your claimed ""successful localized counterattacks""

**""Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations northwest of Kyiv on March 22 and continued to improve their defensive positions and logistical support.[11] Local Ukrainian sources reported Russian forces “entrenched” around Bucha on March 22.[12] Satellite imagery on March 21 additionally depicted fortified Russian artillery positions northwest of Irpin.[13] Ukrainian forces conducted several localized counterattacks on March 22, retaking the towns of Moshcun (northwest of Kyiv) and Makariv (directly west of Kyiv)""**

Russia did not conduct major offensive operations, and there is no confirmation of successful Ukrainian counter-attacks. There are basically, on-going clashes between Ukrainians trying to take advantage of Russia's bungled logistic (and operational pause) to take back some ground with no news on whether they've been successful or not. 

Here's the reporting on LNR/DNR.

**""Russian forces conducted several unsuccessful attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in the last 24 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 22 that Russia and proxy forces concentrated their efforts on capturing Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Popasna, and Vugledar but were unsuccessful.[21] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally stated Ukrainian forces inflicted heavy losses on a Russian attack on Marinka as of noon local time on March 22.""**

There are claims by Ukrainian command. The ISW isn't taking their word for granted, so I don't know why you are. No territory exchanged hands. 

Now you might be wondering why I discount Ukrainian claims. Because they are biased. I look at photographic evidence and cross-match them with Ukranian claims as well as Western reporting, and I do the same with Russian claims. It gives us an inaccurate picture, that's at best, an educated guess. 

Ukrainian General Staff in particular, are the least reliable source for information. Barring the fact that they have routinely denied that Russia will invade, they have pushed the Snake Island story for days without any confirmation. And no, this isn't an urban myth or feel-good or moral propaganda they were running for moral purposes like the Ghost of Kiev. This was an actual event that they routinely claimed happened and it didn't. 

So stop taking Ukrainian claims seriously unless they are backed up  by photographic and video evidence. Even then, we have to verify that it isn't old or inaccurate footage. 

Ukraine is on its backfoot, they are being invaded, and they have every incentive to lie about events and actions that are on-going. This isn't to insult them, just the reality of their situation.",72d35d33dbb0c1022a096c32c2d418376d085431,True,False,,,,,0,1648057466,,0,{},i1tmlye,False,t3_tidybp,False,True,t1_i1tkjt1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tidybp/in_modern_times_how_many_losses_are_needed_before/i1tmlye/,1648057483,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648028666.0,

&gt;I've heard the objection that they weren't willing to give anything up for that. Well, we never tried. We just said this topic was off-limits because ""open door policy,"" no Russian ""veto,"" blah blah blah.

It's been a giant clusterfuck from the beginning. The first week of the war was premised on mind-bogglingly bad assumptions (that the UAF would be a pushover, that there was popular support for Russia in the East, that Zelensky would flee the country, that Kyiv would fall within days, that the West would impose largely symbolic sanctions, etc).

NATO could attempt to shape the conflict such that Russia does not feel an existential threat (limited to no NATO presence east of the Dnieper for example, only air assets committed etc) and hope that MAD prevents further escalation but the risks involved would be massive.

This is the difficulty of political systems that don't resemble our own western democracies: information does not flow neatly back to the executive, but rather is permanently obfuscated by internal politics within the ruling elites (note: democracies also suffer from this problem but the impact is blunted because decision-making is distributed between multiple players). 

So in a wargame style world Russia should have deployed a far larger logistics tail, more troops, utilized their mass fires and air-force effectively, engaged in combined arms warfare effectively, built proper logistics as they moved further into Ukraine, etc. But I don't think any of this is possible given how the Kremlin operates.",86262a725e6be22574b1e7b6dc5d5bece84be527,True,False,,,,,0,1648055309,,0,{},i1tgtp5,False,t3_tksxtx,False,False,t1_i1te0g8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tksxtx/ukraine_megathread_march_23/i1tgtp5/,1648055324,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648026509.0,

With a 50% success rate, and using 1/3 of their stock, they'd take out 50 soldiers, with roughly 500 soldier witnesses. Those 500 witness will probably communicate what happened to 50000 soldiers. That adjusts tactics to compensate. 

10km of range is quite good. Basically you can hit a target without putting yourself in significant risk. 

As far as the bomb, it's probably a 1-2 lbs of high explosives. I'm expecting fragmentation and shrapnel. Not particularly dangerous as I'd assume it would be very similar to a hang grenade. So mostly anti-personnel. The big use of it is that the switchblade is fast and accurate. It can be piloted into an enemy if you know their location and they are exposed outside. One switchblade can take out one enemy. There doesn't seem to be a good defense for it. And it'll hit almost without warning. 

As far as impact, I'd say it's quite devastating. The reason is the psychological impact that it'll have on the Russian enemies. Especially enemies that are at known locations. After hearing about buddies being killed randomly by a fast moving drone, it'll be difficult to do your job without that on the back of your mind. 

To me, the biggest use would be to hit large artillery crews. Artillery is loud and pretty exposed outside. It's also very very difficult to hide. Typically, artillery is behind enemy lines, but if you get within 10km, you can hit them. That isn't very difficult for covert crews. I'd give 3-5 of these switchblades to a small squad.

A brief overview of the war in Ukraine, including:  
- logistics / military situation and outlook  
- domestic opinions in Russia / China  
- sanctions / punitive tax  
- [game theory](https://imgur.com/a/k3bzRvf) (images from [Twitter thread introducing IR](https://twitter.com/olga_chyzh/status/1502785540428644359))  
- negotiations.

This blog post is 8000 words long, but the author summarizes his opinions at the beginning (which I partially copy here):
&gt;  3: [Russia has huge, potentially fatal, logistical problems.](https://i.imgur.com/cWQetBK.png) (from [Twitter](https://i.imgur.com/cWQetBK.png))  
&gt;  
&gt;  6: Ukraine will still find it difficult for now to make progress rolling back Russia’s gains, but that slowly should change as Russia’s army degrades further.  
&gt;  
&gt; 10: Western approach to solving the problems of Russian Oil and Gas are non-zero but mostly not serious or of sufficient magnitude or [thoughtful about economics].  
&gt; 
&gt; 13: A lot of very large ‘pure wins’ also exist that we are not using either. 
&gt; 
&gt; 18: [The West is risking a [penalty for being late](https://www.bradford-delong.com/2011/11/quote-of-the-day-november-14-whats-the-penalty-for-being-late-death-whats-the-penalty-for-treason-death-i-ha.html) problem: If mild deviations from democratic values were punished as severely as starting a war, then autocrats have no incentive to avoid war. Our sanctions need to be in degrees.]
&gt; 
&gt; 20: China is trying to [oppose the West] without provoking the response, so far this is working, but internal propaganda there seems very pro-Putin and anti-USA.  
&gt; 
&gt; 21: Those in opposition [to the West] then tend to both cooperate with each other and to converge on a set of models, beliefs and rhetoric that includes many quite false and/or awful things, an anti-pattern demonstrating opposition.  
&gt; 
&gt; 23: If [peace talks] are real there are three issues: Territory, demilitarization and ‘denazification.’  
&gt; 
&gt; 24: Any peace soon likely involves some territorial concessions, unclear if a possible deal exists here yet.  
&gt; 
&gt; 25: Demilitarization will potentially be a Sweden/Austria model. Includes a no-NATO clause and no-foreign-base-or-exercises clause but not no-EU, Ukraine keeps its army.  
&gt; 
&gt; 26: Denazification will likely be symbolic only, and Russia seems to accept this.

Russia performing poorly in Ukraine doesn't somehow prove they have a ""crap armed forces""? They were fighting a war they were not trained to fight for quite a while.

Same reason why American failures to control insurgencies in Afghanistan or Vietnam don't somehow prove the American armed forces is useless

The UK acquired nukes when it still saw itself as a superpower, as did France when they acquired nukes. The latter wanted to pursue an independent foreign policy and let's not forget actually left NATO for quite a while out of disagreements

As for the rest, the fact most of these countries didn't acquire nukes at the height of the cold war is telling. These days many many multilateral nuclear free zone treaties exist and researching nukes is very costly diplomatically

[],False,,RonLazer,,,[],,,,text,t2_aelpms7c,False,False,"I based my assessment on a number of factors:

1) Pre-staged combat numbers in the Belarus/NW front were around 30,000 according to US intel (as I recall). We know that they advanced in 4 corridors, with 3 of them focused on Chernhiv. It depends on how one assesses the split between the 2 sides of the Dnieper, but I would be very surprised if a full 1/3 of them were in the area immediately to the West of Kyiv. Throwing the bulk of their forces at the West of Kyiv simply doesn't make sense, they have to move through miles of suburbs or try and cross the big national park up there. 

2) The best intel we have on this comes from the UA, who claim there were 14 BTGs advancing on the NE of Kyiv initially, and a further 17 reserve BTGs were deployed along this same front, suggesting they were distributed between Chernhiv and Sumy after the initial attempts to establish a FOB in Hostomel failed. Post here: https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/259676363012116

3) Lastly I'd point out that if the Russians had deployed &gt;10,000 troops in the West of Kyiv then they would have taken Irpin by now. It's not a large or defensible town, but would grant them a direct road into the heart of Kyiv if taken. The only logical explanation is that they don't have the numbers (whether to begin with, or after losses) to press their attack there. 

I think there is a nominal force left there to hold Hostomel and tie up special forces and anti-armour units in the west of Kyiv, as well as keep a foothold there if they do begin to siege the city, but this does not appear to be a strategic priority for the Russians.",8a3468fbc1de5121f7d2a9c9399025ec48fa3bf4,True,False,,,,,0,1648051414,,0,{},i1t69ua,False,t3_tksxtx,False,True,t1_i1sz7t9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tksxtx/ukraine_megathread_march_23/i1t69ua/,1648051430,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648022614.0,

&gt; There is basically a 0% chance Russia fires strategic nuclear weapons first. 

I disagree. Putin very much sees threatening nukes as a potential equaliser.

&gt;  (NATO countries don't need nukes)

Britain and France disagree. In future maybe Poland will too.

&gt; no real sense of danger (why will Russia invading Ukraine inspire Peru to build nukes)

What might happen is some states acquire them. E.g. Iran to deter USA/Israel, Poland to deter Russia, S. Korea to deter N Korea and China.

Then states threatened by those states might get them, e.g. Saudi Arabia in response to Iran.

Then their neighbours might. E.g. Turkey might if lots of its neighbours -- Russia, Iran Israel and KSA all had them.

Then it might become considered a general status thing so mid-level powers such as Brazil and Indonesia get them.

Maybe Peru might feel threatened by Brazil or another South American country?

They may have wanted to join NATO, but it's been 14 years since the Bucharest Declaration and Ukraine still has not received a Membership Action Plan. Many people have forgotten an obvious point here: Ukraine only has the right to apply to join NATO; NATO member countries have the right to reject their application.

&gt;I find it hilarious that I laid upfront the two objections I was familiar with, and then several of you simply repeated those objections (without responding to my rebuttal to them).


You didn't respond to the fact that the Russian invasion in 2014 was in response to Euromaidan, which was largely about EU membership and economic ties, not NATO. NATO supporting Ukrainian neutrality post-2014 would legitimize Russia's invasion.

From 2008 to 2014, denying Ukraine NATO membership because of fears over Russia simply legitimizes right to dictate the status of its neighbors, surrendering Ukraine to Russia regardless of their feelings on neutrality. By saying ""We won't admit you because we're worried about Russia, "" we're de facto reinforcing the right of Russia to keep its neighbors out of security arrangements it doesn't like. 

Ultimately, I agree its ridiculous they don't have an MAP yet, they should have gotten one earlier. If NATO's core mandate is avoiding war in Europe, abandoning Russia's neighbors as they decide to turn West is a sure way to get that - and that's exactly what happened. 

The only way to have prevented this would have been a Ukrainian Lukachenko - the Ukrainian people's desire to turn towards the EU culturally and economically is inherently at odds with Russia, regardless of security arrangements.

As for the losses of high ranking Russian officers - depends on who you ask. There are clearly massive problems with Russian communications, and as a result, their chains of command. An officer who cannot reliably order his troops around from the secure rear will necessarily have to get 'in the thick of it' to make sure his commands make it down the chain. It might also be an attempt to boost flagging morale. It's operationally poor practice, but it will make some difference to the troops on the ground if they can see that their officers aren't just relaxing in a Russian military base whilst sending them off to die in Mariupol.

There is also the argument that I've seen (e.g. from Michael Kofman, who I respect as an analysis) who argues that this high loss rate of the higher ranks is because that is how the Russians operate. Officers are institutionally trained/conditioned to be close to the fighting, and this inevitably leads to a much higher causalty rate for them. 

Personally I think it's a combination of the two - Russian officers are used to being closer to the front than the majority of NATO officers, but they are also being forced into it by communications and morale breakdowns. It might also have something to do with the machismo culture of Russia, as well as the perceived need to be seen to be 'doing something', given that Putin (and, as a knock-on effect, the military top-brass) will be looking for people to blame Russian military issues on. If you're an officer that personally led a successful offensive, then it's probably not going be you on the chopping block.

It also can't be discounted that the Russian communication issues have led them to use non-secure phones or radios, which likely has given Ukrainian forces far more information than they could have even hoped for, as to the location of these officers.

[],False,,sanderudam,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iure,False,False,"To me there seems to be three separate fronts/areas of operation that could result in a critical success to Ukraine with varying degrees of progress and two such areas for Russia.

For Ukraine they are:

1) Russian forces North-West of Kyiv. This is the most promising one for Ukraine into which they seem to have invested the most thus far. It is a very large contingent of Russian forces, that have probably exhausted all potential to advance and are fundamentally at risk of being cut off due to the damn Pripyat marshes being behind them. It makes sense for Ukraine to counter-attack there, as it is close to Kyiv (symbolically important), has decent air coverage (because Kyiv is already a priority) and is the closest to Western Ukraine, where new recruits and supplies can be easily brought in. 

2) Russian forces to the East of Kyiv. These are troops furthest away from supply lines and have been whittled down already. Similar points about proximity to Kyiv and supply lines as for p1, but it makes sense to deal with p1 first before moving into the East Kyiv contingent. A lot depends on the fighting capability and mobility of the Ukrainian forces in Nizhn/Chernigiv for such operations to succeed.

3) And thirdly all the Russian troops to the West of Dnepr in South-Ukraine. It is probable that Russia holds at least numerical parity to Ukraine there and it is one of the better supplied areas for Russia currently, thus any major action there is going to be difficult. However Ukraine only needs to seize a couple of bridges to have the Russian troops completely cut off from supplies (aside air). 

If Ukraine can achieve any of these encirclements with the following capture of the Russian forces, then it would be a major victory. Achieving all three would be the destruction of Russian army.

For Russia the two opportunities are:

1) Capture of Mariupol. It is already and for a long time been surrounded, and there could be as many as 10k Ukrainian troops encircled. Capturing Mariupol with the defenders will be a major Russian victory, opening an opportunity to forcing a peace that sees Russia gain land in Azov. 

2) Ukrainian JFO troops in Eastern Ukraine. I do not think it is probable that Russia could encircle the troops (and keeping them surrounded). However there is a potential to capture smaller groups of Ukrainian troops in some of the towns, as well as capturing the towns as well.

Even if they do brazenly oppose the proliferation of nukes though, there's plenty in place stopping more countries from seeking nukes, including security guarantees (NATO countries don't need nukes), no real sense of danger (why will Russia invading Ukraine inspire Peru to build nukes), expense, diplomatic isolation etc

You win wars with divisions, not with insurgency.  Every successful 'insurgency' was won as an addition to a ground forces campaign, not by harassment alone.  Iraq for example was highly dependent on the fact that there were only like 150k Americans in country at any one time and large parts of the country were controlled by militias with Iran's backing.  Vietnam was mostly a conventional war fought by the NVA contrary to popular opinion.  WW2 was won by the ground armies with the partisans being a nuisance that just helped supplement the main armies.  ATGMs unless integrated into a wider established army aren't going to be decisive and so far if you actually watch the videos posted by the Russians on Telegram isolated ambush units are mostly getting slaughtered rather than doing the slaughtering.  The Ukrainians are only posting the handful of engagements their spec ops are winning, not all their losses.

Don't fall for propaganda.

&gt;No it won't. the Russian advance is over, they lack the men, material and supplies to push further than they have

You know that how?  Ukrainian reports?  They've taken at least 20% of the country and are cleaning up pockets and supply lines and moving up new units from the interior of the country.  We don't really know for sure what is going on given all the propaganda being pushed by every side.  Just because there has been an operational pause and focus on specific battles doesn't mean the advance is over, it could very well mean the focus has changed and digestion of the pockets is ongoing.

&gt;they're even losing ground in the North. 

Source on that?

&gt;This isn't a tactical war, it's an attritional one and Ukraine is resupplying far faster than Russia is.

Do they have the units to resupply?  The Russians seem to have blown up a lot of stuff, they've cut off the easiest access routes via the Black sea, Western gear isn't familiar to the Ukrainian army so there is going to be a lag to get them up to speed while they actually train up all the raw conscripts they don't really have a training establishment to quickly mobilize, and they're in fact even discharging and turning away foreign volunteers due to their lack of training/experience as well as finding out how hard it is to organize a bunch of randos into actually useful units.

Again don't pay attention to corporate media or American ex-general talking heads, this conflict is very opaque as this point due to all the necessary secrecy; even the US military seems to not really be sure what exactly is going on or what is going on in Russia...if they do they're not sharing the reality of the situation because that would mean admitting things are not nearly as rosy as claimed.",54b9d2d0d45a8c85841454e5c0c619d77497339f,True,False,,,,,0,1648042679,,0,{},i1skc93,False,t3_tk2ex2,False,True,t1_i1s441z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk2ex2/ukraine_megathread_march_22/i1skc93/,1648042689,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648013879.0,

I'm not saying that the models are wrong, only that they are useful frames of analysis depending on the topic and field, and that a good scholar will attempt to apply as many as possible. It's the blind men and the elephant: each have a part of the truth, and ideally you should be trying to bring them all together in order to better understand the elephant in the room.

Each theoretical school have basic fundamental theoretical presuppositions that lead to their proscriptions and modelling. International anarchy is a major assumption, for instance, or the relative value of economic interdependence and absolute vs. relative gains (with realism vs liberalism). The overarching neorealist and neoliberal theories are also both structural, which is a major issue when significant portions of the international system are socially/internationally constructed, and particularly in societies  themselves; a black box and assumptions of a rational actor is nice and all for certain analytical purposes, but that means all domestic political processes and structures can be glossed over, and I think that's absolutely a mistake. How we construct national security goals and objectives are based on domestic political factors, and modern IR scholarship is increasingly acknowledging the granularity in this, which is why I say most don't really care about which ""school"" they belong to. For instance, if we were to take a hard, structural realist/neorealist approach to understanding Russian aims, it would be acknowledging it as rational without clear analysis of the domestic political factors that made it rational; e.g., the cultivation of an anti-American, Russian nationalist, or even Eurasianist views in the main political and security apparatuses of the state, the relative power of the selectorate versus Putin, distortions of reality fed to the dictator, etc. In a structural realist and offensive realist framework, that matters not to Mearsheimer, but in reality these factors matter a great deal.

Even beyond this, the three ""isms"" are highly Amero-centric, and recent scholarship has been seeking to try and incorporate non-American/Global South scholars into the discussion, which means including more critical theoretical approaches into the debate. Not sure it's made much dent, but there is that effort.

It will also depend on what field of IR you're working in. In security studies, realism is relatively dominant, since aspects of the model are . Meanwhile, if you're in the new and exciting field of economic statecraft, it would be highly remiss to work solely on realist assumptions; you need a strong grasp of economics and political science and an eye towards the granular aspects of state economic policies (and of both top-down and bottom-up approaches) and of an expanded view of agency beyond the state level. If you're working in international development, I think it would be a disservice to everyone you're working in to not have critical lens when designing programs (gender, race, etc.). 

On the topic of ""tankies"" and Mearsheimer, that's certainly interesting, as Mearsheimer was celebrated for a time in China because he criticized the US in his analysis for being ""just like any other"" great power or hegemon and got something of a royal welcome.

He said: “We didn’t have enough \[weapons\] in the first place. So, we’re running out of weaponry. That’s what we’ll be seeing in the week to come.”  
  
PA Media quote him adding “Tomorrow, President Zelensky will talk to Nato, the whole of Nato, and we will see how can we replenish our stocks and what we can have that has a much longer range and is stronger than ever.  
  
“We have enough weapons to stop tanks immediately when they approach us. But to clear out our land we need to have something with a much greater distance.”

UK newspapers have been running stories of the Ukrainian weapon stocks running low, there was a cabinet meeting today to discuss things and the ambassador made an appeal for a specific class of weapons ""long range anti tank"". 

Zelensky will hold a meeting with NATO today I think. 

So straws in the wind, looks like some key weapon stocks are being drained faster than they are being replenished. This may be because of over promise under delivery by some partners. It may be the Russian strikes actually got weapons that were being fed into the Ukrainian system. Or it may simply be the battle space is pulling for more weapons to hold the line than the system is feeding in the other end. All of these may be true or non. 

As with everything, people need to hold a range of possibilities at the same time. 

But the other important point seems to be range. The west tends to rely on airpower for much of the task of tank destroying. A-10, AH-64, F-16 and European aircraft like the old Tornado were to do this. So we dont tend to have much beyond visual site that is anti tank specific.

If air is out then its artillery. M-270, AS-90 and not much else (British stock the request was to the UK). So again, its speculation but we may see a step up in weapons being shipped. Some mothballed AS-90s or something. Then again it could just be seeing what I want. 

Those two weapon systems would be invaluable right now.",966d9d0056f44ef687382d01dc3c15e856c69bad,True,False,,,,,0,1648041456,,0,{},i1shmf1,False,t3_tksxtx,False,True,t3_tksxtx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tksxtx/ukraine_megathread_march_23/i1shmf1/,1648041468,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648012656.0,

What do you consider ""gaining land""? Because the Russians are essentially advancing on finished roads, and that's about it until they reach a city and spread out.

Assuming that means they own the land between where they crossed the border and their current position on a given day assumes that the populace is apathetic to who is in charge. That's definitely not the case.

Russia likely doesn't have enough men in Ukraine today to hold every major city in an occupation *against the citizens alone*
I say this based on the coalition experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are two places the occupying force enjoyed *far more* support than Russia does.

(2) no general nuclear exchange, but lots of medium sized countries decide they need to acquire nukes, in which case there will probably be a large nuclear war within a few decades.

Remember what the Marshall plan did for the American economy when the US rebuilt all of Europe?

Let Europe and Ukraine make similar economic gains in the rebuilding of Ukraine. One of the more ghoulish economic realities is that there's a lot of money to be made off of rebuilding.

When Katrina smashed New Orleans, the GDP (GSP actually, Gross State Product) of Louisiana grew and grew substantially because all the aid money dumped into their economy for rebuilding ended up with net growth.

We should obviously never wish for such horrors to happen, but re-building after a human disaster is both for the people who survived it and the people helping rebuild a net economic good.

And if that rebuilding happens along economic lines designed to cause corruption to wither away so that Ukraine can accede to full EU membership, Ukraine will be a shining example to what Slavs and other Europeans can accomplish when they work together.

And that's going to have a massive psychological effect on the Russian people: watching the nation they tried to destroy surpass them in every imaginable way.

I also think that using diplomacy and diplomatic structures for espionage became more common in the cold war because of necessity as much as anything else.  The Soviet Union was a closed state, and you couldn't easily get spies in through tourism or immigration, so a Deputy Agricultural Attaché for Berry Fruit or some other weird niche was a way to get an intelligence agent into the country and some plausible excuse for leaving the embassy.  It probably worked the other way around for the Soviets, since there wasn't really much tourism or immigration from the Soviet Union.  I think there was somewhat less of it to the extent that a given country was open enough to allow tourism and/or immigration since those were viable routes for intelligence personnel to enter a country and move around.

And I think the perception always was the Soviet Union abused the system more than most, bringing in way more KGB operatives under diplomatic cover.

I think for most people it'd probably be to annex the Pakistani controlled portion of Kashmir and then balkanize the rest. Actually this is what it was believed India would do in the 1971 war, but they surprised observers by pursuing fairly limited aims in victory

If peaceful relations are established it will likely be a move borne out of pragmatism. To be clear, plenty of Indians have a genuine desire for peace, but even most of them don't have a flowery view on the Pakistani state and would prefer a balkanization scenario where India could have friendly relations with the smaller states.

This reddit is getting closer to r/geopolitics every day. The moment Russian gas stops flowing into Germany is the moment Germany faces a total collapse of their economy. It's also the moment the biggest contributor to Ukraine from the EU since 2014, Germany, will stop contributing. 

Germany already works on a plan which non essential industry branches to shut down when Russian gas stops flowing (source: [https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/energie/energiewirtschaft-bund-arbeitet-an-abschaltplan-fuer-industrie-bei-gas-lieferstopp/28176772.html](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/energie/energiewirtschaft-bund-arbeitet-an-abschaltplan-fuer-industrie-bei-gas-lieferstopp/28176772.html) ). This would lead to mass unemployment and the moment it happens it would also have a dramatic effect on the hole EU economy because it's so interconnected. Then Ukraine would get much less help and support and this may even lead to the rise of populist parties in Germany. When people become desperate, lose their jobs and can't warm or feed themself, then they will vote for extreme and populist parties.

I don't understand how people can be so shortsighted. I am sure that if the USA would be ready to shut down half of their economy to support the other half of the German economy because it would collapse without Russian gas and without big help from the USA, then Germans would be willing to endure little bit of ""inconvenience"" for the sake of punishing Russia even more.",ccd895016be8369e61f6a25f5ce262ae4b21f7fb,True,False,,,,,0,1648028640,,0,{},i1rx478,False,t3_tk2ex2,False,True,t1_i1qzcnx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk2ex2/ukraine_megathread_march_22/i1rx478/,1648028655,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647999840.0,

That's a euphemistic way of saying ""shoe horning"". The man just loved to force every expression of conflict in history into Class Struggle. And just class struggle, but *his very specific way* of understanding class struggle

&gt; weirder

by which you actually mean, *more diverse and complex*. By calling it ""weird"", it could imply that the result is outside predicted parameters. But the main reason why they're outside those parameters is because of how restrictive and tunnel visionned those parameters are, in the first place.

Result?

- he has a very binary understanding of historical conflict. It's not just ""one dimensional"" understanding, but more like ""either or"". This is why his followers in the next century had to constantly retcon what his ideology really entailed.

- he completely does not understand the diversity of factors that may lead to conflict, such as religion, ethnicity, political ideologies *beyond just simply class-related*

- as a result, he comes off as a 19th century version of today's Fedora wearing neckbeard atheist meme. It's almost like he thought: Surely if you are devoted to maintaining your faith and your religious authority figures, you must be nothing more than an oppressed plebe, right? ..... (Talk about completely dismissing agency. I mean, I understand the importance of emphasizing the environment, but we're not just all passive robots)

- he completely underestimated the lasting power of unity (and disunity) created from nationalism. In fact, even Lenin's cherished Empire reverted back to nationalism when they got Barbarossa'd

- he totally missed the possibility of Hybrid ideologies: for example, that class struggle could mix with nationalism from the very very beginning inception (PRC, Vietnam, DPRK) or with faith (Latin American liberation theology)

Even today, it's fun to watch certain people try to use Marx's name to argue for humanity and diversity and inclusion, when his extremism was advocating for the opposite.  As a big time believer in diversity myself, I think there are better role models to choose from.

NATO was formed to counter the USSR, not Russia in particular. Once the USSR ceased existing it became a simply a mutual defense treaty with no adversary. Yeltsin in particular sought to eventually join NATO.

NATO and Russia cooperated largely until 2014 - when Russia invaded Ukraine. The idea that NATO is inherently anti-Russian isn't particularly true - although by now they're certainly anti-Putin. 

The idea that NATO has always been entirely focused on containing Russia is a little silly. The USSR was a legitimate military superpower - the Russian Federation is not. If Russia wasn't constantly invading its neighbors, NATO wouldn't really care about Russia.

The NATO wont protect Ukraine from Russia as you can see right now but they still think that US will protect them.

The reason why Zelenksy president is because he is candidate that is chosen to avoid war with Russia and as you can see it has failed.

It is incredible to me that a country with an economy as large as India's still imports so much of its defense equipment. There have been a few attempts to diversify the sources, notably the Rafale purchases. But overall India is still deeply beholden to foreign defense companies. 

When Indonesia recently made its big Rafale and F-15 purchase it seemed almost bizarrely deliberate in its obviousness to have two different sources of fighters.

Ukraine only really started pushing for NATO membership after Russia invaded Crimea - which is kinda reasonable, considering they just got invaded.

Also, the Russian invasion of Crimea had little to do with NATO. It was in response to Euromaidan, which notably isn't called Natomaidan. Ukrainian interest in EU membership and western economic ties was the prime motivation for Russian aggression in 2014, not security concerns.

There are a lot of reasons to blame NATO for a lot of shit, but this isn't really one of them.

One article with no named sources. 

&gt;Reading this carefully, I conclude 

And its the opinion of a well known contrarian. 

&gt;I have evidence from other sources to corroborate this. “The only end game now,” a senior administration official was heard to say at a private event earlier this month,

Deep Throat 2.0. 

&gt;I gather that senior British figures are talking in similar terms. 

Again very vague. 

&gt;. And the reason for that, as we have seen, is the Biden administration’s intense fear that Putin may escalate to nuclear war if U.S. support for Ukraine goes too far.

No. The escalation pathway is not some MiGs to Ukraine then nuking New York. Its a series of running escalations starting with Russia beginning to call up reserves en masse. It creates pathways where both sides end up with sunk cost fallacy and need to keep doing more to save face. 

A general war in Europe with maybe 4 million troops fighting in 6 months time is the real risk. Nuclear a very small but realist outcome. People skip over the likely, to the unlikely to then attack the strawman. 

You all want historic analogies. Look at July 1914. Once the call up time tables are put in motion, who can stop them? When is the line in the sand. 

Now my personal take is pretty much we could end the Russians in Ukraine in a week for less than 1000 NATO dead. It will get scary as it will be Kalibers hitting Warsaw and Berlin. But that does not mean the risks of a runaway escalation once the troops start getting call up is not real.",63be083a45fd601303c6a353c5478ef029723e59,True,False,,,,,0,1648017134,,0,{},i1rjs68,False,t3_tk2ex2,False,True,t1_i1qlmuo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk2ex2/ukraine_megathread_march_22/i1rjs68/,1648017150,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647988334.0,

&gt; Calder Walton is Assistant Director of the Applied History Project at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

Quotes from the article:

&gt; Today, western intelligence agencies are hopefully recruiting disaffected Russian intelligence officers, working under diplomatic cover in the West, who will follow in the path of their Soviet predecessors. It is not difficult to imagine Russian foreign intelligence officers feeling despondent and disgusted by Putin’s war in Ukraine— now willing to share the secrets they know to be on the right side of history.

&gt; Hopefully Western case officers are busy with operations that one day we will read about in declassified files. With even better luck, the West will be able to obtain the modern-day equivalent to the KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin. He was so horrified about the Soviet regime’s cruelty, that he smuggled an archive of KGB secrets (the “Mitrokhin Archive”) to the West, with the help of MI6. Today, the West needs a similar Mitrokhin to expose Putin’s darkest intelligence secrets.

It is interesting that the Russian espionage machine operates at such a high tempo when its economy is so much smaller than the west, and its military is in shambles. It may be cliche to say so, but my guess is that this has to do with the priorities of the boss, and the prestige he grants to intelligence work versus the military.",c5e0568147892cd9d32b8fe158303cff4e8c7bb3,True,False,,,,,0,1648016084,,0,{},i1rigu8,True,t3_tkngfg,False,True,t3_tkngfg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tkngfg/soviet_espionage_under_the_cover_of_diplomacy_the/i1rigu8/,1648016099,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647987284.0,

A typical ratio for KIA/casualties would be maybe 1/3, which is a significant figure in relation to the invasion force's overall strength. This ratio is roughly in line with Vietnam's ratio with the US, assuming Russia has comparable medical care (which they should). That is calculated using conservative US KIA estimates, which are already some of the lowest from the international community, and which are a week and a half out of date. 

I agree with you that KIA counts are going to be unreliable, and that they have probably decreased, they are just a fundamentally difficult thing to get accurate info on. But, using the best sources we have, they are steep. 

Speculating now, I would say confidently that quite a few more than 10 BTGs are no longer combat effective. They are uniquely sensitive to troop losses due to them being light on infantry even at full strength.

It's already become clear that Russia have outright failed some of their strategic objectives but that's likely little consolation for the concessions that they would be forced to make when signing a peace treaty. The analysis given is reasonable enough but it's missing another half to explain how the Ukranians might actually capitalise on their advantages or Russian failures to gain momentum.

&amp;nbsp;

Furthermore it's also failing to consider how the war will actually end and what the avenues for escalation are for each party (including NATO). If Putin does consider a poor outcome in this war to be an existential threat to his regime then how far will he (and his generals) be willing to go? Will NATO follow him there? I think there is good reason to see this as a genuine threat because it completely shatters multiple national narratives on which putin has built his support domestically as well as potentially sparking a seismic shift within Russian institutions like the army and FSB (as well as the dispositions of his oligarchs in response to sanctions).

&amp;nbsp;

Direct military involvement by a NATO member at this stage carries great risks but only moderate benefits. 

To me, the most worrying part is the ambiguity it would bring about which Russian responses would be unacceptable or cross ""red lines"", which would be seen as escalatory, and which would be viewed as proportionate. It will be politically difficult for the US and NATO partners to start putting conditions on collective defense to exclude escalating against proportionate Russian retaliation, and technically difficult for them to clearly and unambiguously communicate their views on every possible scenario to the Russian side.

Sweden and Finland are non-NATO, ""neutral"" nations that have escaped subjugation by Russia.

Let's be very clear here: Russia never took any formal steps toward joining NATO. The idea of Russia joining NATO never went beyond sidebar conversations at international meetings, analyses by think tanks, and occasional vague references in the media. There is no indication that applying for NATO membership has ever been part of Russian government policy.

In your analogy, the disappointed teenager wasn't rejected from Harvard; they never applied in the first place.

Here's a [2010 article from The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2010/11/18/5-reasons-why-russia-will-never-join-nato-a3105) that goes into some reasons NATO membership is not compatible with Russian interests. Those reasons are, briefly:

1. NATO's requirements of democratic, civilian control of the armed forces and transparency in military affairs are not compatible with Putin's government and military policy as it actually exists;
2. Conservatives and nationalists never stopped viewing NATO as ""the enemy"", and these are politically powerful interest groups in Putin's government;
3. NATO membership would almost certainly upset the Russia-China relationship, viewed as a key strategic interest;
4. NATO membership is likely not compatible with the CSTO, the Russian-led mutual defense alliance among many post-Soviet states;
5. Perception that joining NATO means acknowledging that Russia is no longer a ""great power"" and is in some way subordinate to the United States.

Those, and other concerns from the Russian side, aren't necessarily permanent, total deal-breakers. In the past NATO has shown flexibility on the requirement for civilian control of the armed forces, for example regarding Greece during the colonels' junta of 1967-1974, or Portugal under the authoritarian *Estado Novo* from NATO's founding to 1974. But the existence of so many complications - ones that largely haven't existed for other prospective members - should tell us that Russia joining NATO was a fraught proposition all along.

&gt; (1994) Although the United States and its NATO partners insist that no European nations would be prevented from joining NATO, a point Mr. Clinton reiterated today, both NATO and Moscow know that Russia remains the perceived enemy in Europe and would be at the bottom of the list.

The 1997 Founding Act signed by both parties states:

&gt; The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its member States, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other hand, hereinafter referred to as NATO and Russia, based on an enduring political commitment undertaken at the highest political level, will build together a lasting and inclusive peace in the Euro-Atlantic area on the principles of democracy and cooperative security.

&gt; **NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries.** They share the goal of overcoming the vestiges of earlier confrontation and competition and of strengthening mutual trust and cooperation. The present Act reaffirms the determination of NATO and Russia to give concrete substance to their shared commitment to build a stable, peaceful and undivided Europe, whole and free, to the benefit of all its peoples. Making this commitment at the highest political level marks the beginning of a fundamentally new relationship between NATO and Russia. They intend to develop, on the basis of common interest, reciprocity and transparency a strong, stable and enduring partnership.

There is a lot of space between ""NATO and Russia are mutual enemies"" and ""Russia joins NATO"". NATO and Russia were both perfectly fine with a cooperative security arrangement that fell short of NATO membership - for good reasons *on both sides of the table*. This cooperative arrangement has fallen apart *entirely* because of the Putin government's hostile policies toward NATO and the EU. Negative moves by the NATO side have come *exclusively* as responses to Russian actions that were incompatible with its cooperative security arrangements with NATO and the EU.

So not only did your teenager never apply to Harvard; they voided their admissions to all those other universities by being suspended for fighting, dropping out of high school before graduation, and being convicted of drunk driving. And yet they're complaining that it's *so unfair* that Harvard hasn't sent them an admissions letter. Except they aren't even doing that, because they don't even want to go to Harvard; they're mad that some of their classmates, who they think of as unworthy, got accepted.",06c4731630490c3120d61676bfc106bb65655534,True,False,,,,,0,1648002251,,0,{},i1qva51,False,t3_tjb6cf,False,True,t1_i1qrbs1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjb6cf/ukraine_megathread_march_21/i1qva51/,1648002268,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647973451.0,

But SIPRI data says that for the past 10 years Russia's annual military spending has been between 10x-20x that of Ukraine's. 

Similarly Russia's annual GDP was approximately 10x that of Ukraine. And while the sanctions have undoubtedly had a significant economic impact on Russia, I can't imagine it's greater than the amount of impact the invasion is having on Ukraine's economy.

It seems to me that the invasion has stalled due to three main factors:

1. massive strategic and tactical blunders by the Russians
* Massive influx of military aid from the west
* Popular support for the Ukrainian resistance / defence both foreign and domestic

But eventually the military aid to Ukraine is going to slow down, the Russians are already shifting to slower but more reliable tactics and as the war drags on, popular support for the current government will wane.

Unless Ukraine can mount what seems like a Hail Mary counter offensive, I can't think of any reason why Russian forces wouldn't eventually be able to encircle Ukrainian strongholds such as Kyiv, cut off the supply of military aid to the Ukrainian defenders and force a surrender.

The most likely ""win"" scenario for Ukraine imo is a conditional surrender with a peace treaty that makes Crimea et al Russian satellite states or outright Russian territories, institutes a ""de-Nazification"" process whereby Western aligned leaders are stripped of power and prevents Ukraine from entering into international partnerships without Russia's permission.

A decisive or even conditional Ukrainian military victory seems very unlikely. But then again I thought the same about a full fledged invasion of Ukraine in the first place.

If I don't eat for a month, I will most likely die. This is the issue that is facing the RuAF right now.

The issues with food were particularly prevalent in the second week of the conflict, right at the point where the self-sufficiency of a Russian BTG is at its limit. At this point, I haven't see any horror stories with supplies on Telegram (the most unfiltered source at this point). 

The conclusions I've made are two-fold. 

1. Russians have stopped getting ambushed and captured in droves like on the first day of the invasion.

2. Russians are slowly fixing the logistics issues. 

&gt;Sorry, I did not make my point clear. RuAF equipment is not as capable as a 30 year newer combat system should be compared to what it is mainly facing. The M1A1 had no issues (even in pitched, short ranged battles) with T72s. We expected similar or larger performance gaps to exist between a T72B3 obr.2016/T80UM and a T64BV, as we saw between M1A1s and T72s (really T62s). This is the equipment capability I am discussing, and tanks are the area where I have the most specific knowledge (since I have been an armored crewman, and trained with Ukrainian armored crewmen in 2017). Heres some proof:

Just to make it clear, you don't need to prove anything to me. I am not a professional military analyst, I am a hobbyist. Furthermore, I am a grad student in Economics, largely an unrelated field. I am not going to be hounding anyone from credentials unless I am particularly ticked off. 

On to the point of discussion. A T-72B3 has more or less parity with Ukraine's modernized variant T-64BM2 or Bulat, or w.e.. There is certainly a qualitative edge in Russian tanks, but it's not overwhelming, because Ukraine's defense sector is capable of making a decent tank. 

I think this has less to do with Russia being unable to produce a good tank (I have yet to see T-90Ms being destroyed or captured on the field), and more to do with Ukrainians building decent tanks themselves. 

But that's neither here nor there. The story of Russian tanks isn't really a story of them losing or failing to destroy Ukrainian tanks. The issue here is that Russians are reacting poorly to ambushes and are routinely picked off by ATGMs that are better than anything Iraq had in either war. 

&gt;They are not, but they also should not be facing a peer power and from all indications, they are. They are the larger power in this case, but this is definitely the rate of losses that would be expected in a true peer conflict.

&gt;I will disagree with this, because I think the crux of the Ukrainian strategy is not to hold ground (in most cases), but to cause attrition to the RuAF. I feel like we are quoting MK quite a bit, but it all boils down to this, do you think we have seen the best the RuAF have to offer? In my estimation the last two weeks (and this coming week) are where the RuAF will be at its relative ""strongest"" in this conflict. After that I believe exhaustion, attrition and less capable replacement will lower RuAF effectiveness in the next stage of the conflict.

I think you have made good points here and your position is reasonable, but I think you are discounting the attrition rate of Ukrainian forces. Russia, even an exhuasted Russia, will have a baseline for performance, and they are more than capable of slowly shelling Ukraine's forces into submission. 

The state of Ukraine's army right now is a big question mark and I think people are taking their resistance for granted.",2cdb119b7a2514b3a50f7dbc465c8ee26426266b,True,False,,,,,0,1648001184,,0,{},i1qt0zx,False,t3_tk7owk,False,False,t1_i1qli6b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk7owk/russian_force_structure_for_the_conduct_of/i1qt0zx/,1648001199,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647972384.0,

But Russia wasn't excluded from the expansion of NATO. It was *included* in a number of institutions meant to foster closer ties between NATO and the former Soviet Union. These institutions didn't guarantee NATO membership to Russia - nor did they guarantee that Russia would even want to join NATO - but they did bring Russia, the former Soviet Union and NATO closer on questions of international security.

The institutions include:

* The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); signatory of the 1990 Paris Charter and 1999 Charter for European Security (also known as the Istanbul Document of 1999)
* The North Atlantic Cooperation Council, formed in 1991 and dedicated specifically to promoting partnership between NATO and non-NATO members in the Euro-Atlantic region; succeeded by the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council per the 1997 Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation (the Paris Accords)
* Partnership for Peace, formed in 1994 and intended as a mechanism for building trust and the capacity for limited interoperability between NATO and its non-NATO neighbors
* Mutual arms reduction in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (1990) and the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (agreed to in 1999 but not ratified by the NATO side)
* Joint military operations under NATO command: IFOR in Bosnia to carry out the Dayton Accords, which saw a Russian brigade operationally subordinated to the US 1st Armored Division; after a rocky start (including an armed standoff at Pristina airport), the two sides cooperated as members of KFOR as well. KFOR cooperation is notable as an instance where NATO and Russia were able to cooperate on military and security issues while respectfully differing on the related political issue of Kosovo independence.
* Non-military cooperation on logistics for ISAF in Afghanistan
* Joint military exercises in 2011

[],False,,DuckTwoRoll,,,[],,,,text,t2_1euk4478,False,False,"&gt; This is speculation. We don't know Russia's military losses. I'm not disputing that they are significant, but they can absorb the losses they've suffered so far. Especially as they learn and adapt their tactics.

They can, but they cannot afford the rate they are losing them. I could afford to not eat for a week, and probably come off fine from it. If I don't eat for a month, I will most likely die. This is the issue that is facing the RuAF right now.

&gt;IMO, the issue Russia faces right now is exhaustion. These soldiers have had a pretty hellish three weeks. Russia is probably rotating or going to rotate troops out, but what happens on the third and fourth rotation? Will those troops want to go back into the fight?

I will agree with this, but with the addition that rotating out mechanized forces is far more difficult than motorized or light infantry forces. You lose both the familiarity with the land, but depending on how the mechanized forces themselves are rotated (either with or without their vics) you have a far higher logistical or tribal knowledge burden. 

&gt;I'm sorry but I don't really follow what your point here is. You can look at Oryx's site. The vast majority of Russia's tank fleet is T-72Bs or newer. These are good tanks, and anything T-72B3 or newer is pretty much a brand new tank.

Sorry, I did not make my point clear. RuAF equipment is not as capable *as a 30 year newer combat system* should be compared to what it is mainly facing. The M1A1 had no issues (even in pitched, short ranged battles) with T72s. We expected similar or larger performance gaps to exist between a T72B3 obr.2016/T80UM and a T64BV, as we saw between M1A1s and T72s (really T62s). This is the equipment capability I am discussing, and tanks are the area where I have the most specific knowledge (since I have been an armored crewman, and trained with Ukrainian armored crewmen in 2017). Heres some proof: https://imgur.com/a/wNYgAMN

&gt;Do you think they are burying thousands of troops for every inch in Mariupol? They might not have the finesse of our door-to-door tactics in Fallujah, but there is plenty of CQB in Mariupol right now. They're not just shelling a building at the slightest hint of resistance, and they're making steady progress.

Of course not, but they are taking heavy losses along a multi 100km front. 


&gt;Initial political objectives yes. Regime change is highly unlikely if not impossible at this point. However, Russia is perfectly capable of achieving a military victory. For all the tactical blunders, they are on the way to a military victory.

If a military victory is defined as the encirclement and destruction of UA in the JFO then I will agree, if this means seizing Odessa and Karkhiv then I will disagree. 


&gt;And people are forgetting, they're not fighting some ragtag force with zero experience. I made this point about Ukraine's military and how hard it fought in 2014.

They are not, but they also *should not be facing a peer power* and from all indications, they are. They are the larger power in this case, but this is definitely the rate of losses that would be expected in a true peer conflict. 

&gt;This is a NATO trained force armed with NATO weapons. Quite frankly, Russians are beating them. They took some big punches because they went in with unrealistic expectations and they underestimated their enemy, but they're quickly re-evaluating.

I will disagree with this, because I think the crux of the Ukrainian strategy is not to hold ground (in most cases), but to cause attrition to the RuAF. I feel like we are quoting MK quite a bit, but it all boils down to this, do you think we have seen the best the RuAF have to offer? In my estimation the last two weeks (and this coming week) are where the RuAF will be at its relative ""strongest"" in this conflict. After that I believe exhaustion, attrition and less capable replacement will lower RuAF effectiveness in the next stage of the conflict.

No nuclear power wants to normalise the use of nuclear weapons. It would be a enormous disaster for every single one of them. It would huge increase the risk of nuclear war (which no one sane wants) by undermining one of the fundamental aspects of nuclear deterrence. It would also make every single other nation in the world want nuclear weapons for security, leading to a huge proliferation of nuclear weapons. That's bad for existing nuclear powers in two ways: It reduces their special status and, again, increases the risk of nuclear war.

The West would absolutely enact a full boycott of all trade with Russia. I expect China to support that. China wants to expand its empire, and it loves undermining the west.

[],False,,June1994,,,[],,,,text,t2_fgez9,False,True,"&gt;I mean, Russia has lost a minimum of +2 divisions of combat power. This isn't the death of the RuAF by any stretch, but it is a significant amount of losses in a relatively short amount of time. This rate of casualties is not sustainable. The Ukrainians are also likely losing combat power at an unsustainable rate, but from what evidence I have seen Russia is losing combat power at a faster rate than Ukraine is. This is mostly due to Ukraine being supported by Western powers and full internal mobilization, while Russia has not entered a ""total war"" stance.

This is speculation. We don't know Russia's military losses. I'm not disputing that they are significant, but they can absorb the losses they've suffered so far. Especially as they learn and adapt their tactics. 

IMO, the issue Russia faces right now is exhaustion. These soldiers have had a pretty hellish three weeks. Russia is probably rotating or going to rotate troops out, but what happens on the third and fourth rotation? Will those troops want to go back into the fight? 

 &gt;Onto equipment: Say what you will about Iraq in GW1, but they had a large and well equipped military for the time. Most of their tanks may have been T55/T62s but they also had a significant amount of T-72s. And T72s in 1991 were more modern than T-64BVs are in 2022. It's not like the US wasn't driving around in fucking M60s either.

I'm sorry but I don't really follow what your point here is. You can look at Oryx's site. The vast majority of Russia's tank fleet is T-72Bs or newer. These are good tanks, and anything T-72B3 or newer is pretty much a brand new tank. 

&gt;This isn't to say that the RuAF are a paper tiger, but rather to illustrate that their on-paper capabilities are not matching their real-world performance. The ratio between this being due to operational (really, political) employment, lack of tactical prowess, or lack of equipment capability is up for debate. We know for certain that horrendous opening strategies have been a massive cause of this, but they are not the only cause.

I think Russia is performing exactly to their on-paper spec. Their tactical performance is average. There are still silly clips and incompetence on display even today, but in general, Russians are advancing, seizing ground, and fighting well. 

Do you think they are burying thousands of troops for every inch in Mariupol? They might not have the finesse of our door-to-door tactics in Fallujah, but there is plenty of CQB in Mariupol right now. They're not just shelling a building at the slightest hint of resistance, and they're making steady progress. 

&gt;For the last point: Russia did not commit sufficient resources to accomplish its initial political objectives. Whether this is because it was unwilling or unable is the crux of the argument. I think Michael Kofman has been almost a prophet for how this has played out so far, and as he says ""has the war entered a stalemate? Yes and no. Russian forces may make slow, incremental advances in the Donbas. I suspect UKR military can hold on most fronts and perhaps even counter attack on others. However, attrition is undoubtedly taking its toll on both sides. ""

Initial political objectives yes. Regime change is highly unlikely if not impossible at this point. However, Russia is perfectly capable of achieving a military victory. For all the tactical blunders, they are on the way to a military victory. 

And people are forgetting, they're not fighting some ragtag force with zero experience. I made this [point](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/sznbr7/how_do_you_hide_your_army_in_the_age_of_satellite/hy6inw3/?context=3) about Ukraine's military and how hard it fought in 2014. 

This is a NATO trained force armed with NATO weapons. Quite frankly, Russians are beating them. They took some big punches because they went in with unrealistic expectations and they underestimated their enemy, but they're quickly re-evaluating. 

We're not seeing people driving randomly deep into Kharkiv. They're making pretty sensible strategic decisions and they are slowly accomplishing them. From what I can tell, Izyum is taken, and it judging by the footage, it was obvious that both sides wanted that city really badly, and Russians won. 

I think even people who listen to Kofman really are falling for the general sentiments in the headlines rather than objective analysis. As he says, ""Russia is not 12 feet tall, but it's not 4 feet tall either"" And I definitely don't think it's fair to say they are 5 or 6 feet tall, I think they are quite obviously 8 feet tall.

For all their faults, they have clearly shown that they have lots of capabilities, and that under the right leadership they are perfectly capable of achieving military objectives without losing a ton of tanks to do it. But people choose to overlook Russian success because it's against our preferred outcome and our preferred narrative.",5844f023a82f82eabcc5f5361354ce31445481d1,True,False,,,,,0,1647995181,,0,{},i1qfszf,False,t3_tk7owk,False,True,t1_i1qbqqg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk7owk/russian_force_structure_for_the_conduct_of/i1qfszf/,1647995194,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647966381.0,
