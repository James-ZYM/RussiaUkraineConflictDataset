&gt;Yes wearing Nazi symbols is wrong too

I dgaf about symbols for the most part. US troops wear punisher badges on their kit. I care about deeds. If someone is defending their streets and houses and families from a force which is determined to murder and enslave them, I don't care if the defender is weasring the skin of their enemy and the attacker is wearing a tutu.

No article of the Budapest Memorandum stipulates any of the parties come to Ukraine’s aid in the event of non-nuclear aggression, but the spirit of these agreements was that Ukraine could denuclearize in a world where US and hence NATO (nuclear) power would continue to deter Russian aggression. If Ukraine had nukes today, there would likely not be an invasion of this scale (would Russia still have taken Crimea? maybe). 

It’s somewhere between the lines here that I think the US becomes (or affirms its place as) a bad actor on the international stage in its hesitancy to supply fighter jets and other equipment to Ukraine. I’m also of the mind that NATO expansionism is an instigating factor of this invasion. The WORLD benefits from their being fewer nukes, and Ukraine benefited the world be destroying their arsenal knowing full well the Russian bear hadn’t changed spirit when the Soviet Union fell, and expecting NATO power would deter something like this.

They were part of the USSR for a period of time and have many blood relatives that reside in Russia, so it's to be expected.  There's also many adults alive that were indoctrinated under Soviet Russia, too.  They've gone to teach their children the same ideologies, and the cycle continues.  Due to this, it's difficult to fully separate from these constructs even after decades of ""independence"", which I think we can all agree wasn't true independence until Petro Poroshenko took office.  Russia has been anti-LGBTQ and anti-semitic for a long while.  Stalin and Khrushchev, bore a contemptuous attitude towards Jews in Russia and abroad, too.  There was also plenty of instances of intolerance of Jews by the Russian Orthodox church.  All of this filters down.

Per the ""nazi-symbolisms"", you're referring to the Black Sun, or sonnerand, which pre-dates the Nazi's by many centuries and was used as a funeral rite token.  Also, the wolfsangel that's displayed on the Azov patch that some people mention was a symbol created during the peasant uprising against oppression of German princes an was a symbol of their liberty.  It also different from the Wolfangel that was used by any Nazi elements in WW2 Germany.

As to the training camps - these are clearly a product of the former Russian occupation and the ultra-nationalistic need for Ukrainians to protect themselves after gaining full independence (e.g. not having a Russo-puppet in office).  They never thought they were free from the threat of Russian aggression, especially knowing Putin's views that an independent Ukraine doesn't and shouldn't exist. They knew this day was coming.  It was just a matter of time.  The anti-LGBTQ and white supremacist indoctrination is pretty on par with what you see in Russia today, although it's officially excoriated though tolerated if not subversively encouraged in Russia.  Thankfully, these groups are small and not endemic to the majority of the population that lives in Western Ukraine - which is a much more progressive and diverse array of people.

It's true that Zelenskyy did have offshore accounts.  The ongoing narrative is that such accounts were necessary to protect himself and assets against pro-Russian forces that could seize such funds.

From a Russian intelligence perspective it must be a nightmare, because the location of enemies in Ukraine is .... *EVERYWHERE*. Anywhere Russian troops are not, that's (theoretically) where the enemy is. Even if you used reddit to geolocate 4 guys with MANPADs in a forest somewhere, what are the chances they'll still be there?

I see 3 potential possibilities for a coup. The first is by some of Putin's aids/inner circle. In this case he will be replaced with someone with the same basic ideology as him, and there will be no basic change in the running of the government. Maybe not even leading to the end of the war.  
  
The second is a coup by the military who are fed up with how the war is going. This may mean an end to the war, but a regime that still oppresses its citizens.  
  
The 3rd is a coup by the people. Unfortunately, the 1992 collapse of the Soviet Union, proved the general populace incapable of coming together in a consensus and forming a representative government that will work for the benefit of the people.  
  
And if Putin simply hands the reins of government over to anyone else, it will likely mean a continuation of the same.

So UA pilots can probably test out of the first year. But then again they'd need to unlearn a bunch of stuff too, so maybe not.

Assuming they test out of the first year they're still looking at having to speed run two 1 year courses before going on to platform specific training before being ""combat effective"".

""Pilot candidates then attend either Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) or joint specialized undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT). ENJJPT is located at Sheppard AFB, Texas. The entire course lasts about 54 weeks. Students learn with, and are taught by, U.S. Air Force officers and officers from various air forces of our European allies.      

The JSUPT program lasts approximately 52 weeks. After successfully completing JSUPT, officers receive their silver wings and are awarded the aeronautical rating of pilot. They attend follow-on training in their assigned aircraft at various bases known as Formal Training Units (FTUs) around the country.

Nineteenth Air Force also provides follow-on training for most Air Force pilots in their assigned aircraft. Pilots assigned to fighter aircraft complete the introduction to fighter fundamentals course at Randolph AFB or Sheppard AFB, Texas, or Moody AFB, Ga., flying the AT-38B, and then move on to train in either the F-15 Eagle at Tyndall AFB, Fla., the F-15E Strike Eagle at Seymour-Johnson AFB, NC., or the F-16 Fighting Falcon at Luke AFB, Ariz. Altus AFB, Okla., hosts training for pilots assigned to the KC-135 Stratotanker and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. The C-5 training center has moved from Altus to Lackland AFB, TX. Aircrews assigned to fly the C-130 train at Little Rock AFB, Ark. or Dobbins ARB, GA, and pilots assigned to fly MC-130 Combat Talon, HC-130 aircraft, UH-1N, HH-60 Pave Hawk, and CV-22 Osprey pilots receive their training at Kirtland AFB, N.M. Keesler AFB, Miss., provides training for pilots assigned to the C-21. A schoolhouse is being stood-up at Canon AFB, NM for the NSAv fleet and the U-28 schoolhouse is at Hurlburt Field, FL. The new MC-12 schoolhouse (MQT course) is in Meridian, MS, preceded by a simulator course for IQT.""
