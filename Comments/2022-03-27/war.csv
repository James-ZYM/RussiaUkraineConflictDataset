So, to the rest of your answer: I did not talked about the reason why and how at all. I didnt even morally valued the Azov tactics, I just pointed that out, as this is part of war, not just ""oh lets just bomb Schools"" and so on.. I don\`´\`´t know how old you are, but maybe you are to young to Remember how other bigger wars in the last 20 years  have been done.  I dont know what expectations do people have when facing a war? Yes, it's just not like in the computer games. Civilians are dying, it's unfair, it's dirty, people lose respect for other peoples Life, see them as animals. It doesn't matter if you're the attacker or the attacked.

Here are five reasons why it wasn't about NATO, and/or even if it was, we should have still told Putie to get bent:

1. If it was about Ukraine joining NATO, this would have ended as soon as Zelensky said (pre-invasion!) that he would agree to neutrality and not join NATO. Instead Putie rolled tanks.
2. At one point Putie had 2 NATO countries (Latvia and Estonia) on his border. These countries are tiny, are poorly located for transfer of troops or staging logistical support, and the two of them *combined* have fewer troops in their entire armed forces than are in the 10th Mountain Division of the US Army.  
By essentially annexing Belarus and taking Ukraine, Putie will reduce that total by...no, wait, he'll increase it to 7. And 4 of those countries have land lines of communication with all of Europe. 
3. Treating NATO membership as a provocation means we are saying poor Putie has a right to submissive neighbors, and if they don't have a submissive neighbor it's the same as that neighbor bombing or invading them. That's a recipe for ""justified"" war across the globe. 
4. Nearly every NATO member was invaded &amp; occupied by hostile totalitarians (some twice!) and held for 5 or 45 years. If they start a ""Don't get invaded and occupied"" club and Putie has a problem with someone joining it, he was planning to invade and occupy.
5. A guy who was worried about a neighbor joining NATO doesn't deluge his people with fake ethnic cleansing propaganda he can't walk back. And he doesn't use artillery on hospitals and send death squads looking for refugees in civilian vehicles.

NATO's presence in Ukraine would pose a massive threat to Russia should both go into conflict in the future, and gives nato big edge over Russia. It's a steppe without mountains straight into Russia's economic core, giving NATO ability to walts in and cut off Russia from it's oil. If that happened, Russia would be done in months, if not weeks.

NATO's purpose of getting Ukraine to it's side is exactly that, and if that fails (which it did because it caused war), then it's a way to justify crippling Russia with sanctions and economic isolation, pretty much dealing with Russia without causing a huge direct war (leaving it as proxy war). This is all done because US knows that China is becoming a massive threat to them, so they want to get Russia out of the way before that conflict becomes more than just bunch of air planes violating airspace. With Russia still strong, US would have a hard time dealing with China.

The Ukrainian-Russian war is not stemmed from recent history, but from ancient history. About a millennium before. It’s not even about a war between two nations, but between cultures. For centuries, the Russian culture has said that Ukrainians are merely a part of us but simultaneously, also weaker. Russia supported this by exterminating any signs of Ukrainian culture. It was illegal to play Ukrainian instruments just a few decades ago. 

This war isn’t about something tangible to Putin, it’s about glory and pride. He wants to be the great imperial leader, like many before, who expanded Russian borders and conquered land. That’s what the Russian state has always deemed as power.

It’s simply naive to reduce the conflict to a tangible thing like NATO bases. Putin said it was a mistake to let Ukraine be independent, and to even have power in the Soviet Union.

Shooting POW in their legs, when they are bound with no weapons and surrounded, is not necessary and thus a war crime.

They bombed those positions that confirmed the presence of enemy military.  
Rockets are fired every day. All the words about ammunition shortages also need to be confirmed. The intensity of fire depends on the availability of necessary targets, now there are objectively fewer obvious targets.

  
And there is nothing good about that. This is war. The time for diplomacy has passed, pumping up arms and ignoring the ultimatum has led to terrible things. It didn't start in 1 month, it started in 2014 and earlier.

  
In Syria there may have been an accidental hit, although I haven't found 100% confirmation (investigations). What other military conflicts have there been? Also, why weren't you screaming when NATO was doing the same thing (haha, standard tactic ""what about you"", but it does have a place)?

The other reason is the opposing side is more likely to treat your own surrendered soldiers in a similar manner. It's best for both sides of a war that this can of worms is left unopened.

Furthermore the Russians have and continue to commit war crimes. Syria and now Ukraine are just the last 4 of the more recent war crimes Russia has committed.

And yes, Ukrainian troops are committing war crimes too, which is just as horrible of a thing to do than from anyone else. However if there wouldn't be a war, no one would be dying.

Первый русский в семье-мой отец.  
Прадед,в бытность раскулаченный тут,взял и увез в 60х годах половины семьи,непосредственно родных и моей матери и бабки сестер и братьев обратно на Украину.  
У меня около сотни родных сейчас в Запорожье,Чернигове,Полтаве и Днепре.  
У родного брата жена с Харькова.Сложись всё по иначе в юности у меня самого сейчас жена была бы с Винницы.  
Деды мои воевали в ВоВ,один до 50х гонял бандеровскую шваль по Карпатам.  
Вся моя родня только и ждёт чтобы их ""аннексировали"",кроме одного дядьки,ну у того по отцу дед-полицай.  
Самый лучший вариант-забрать половину Украины обратно и жить с Россией в мире без нациков.  
Ты с какого перепугу решил,что нацисткая идеология-это идеология для всех.  
Есть туево не пророссийских даже,но просоветских светлых людей,сам факт существования некоторых партий у вас типа ОПЗЖ или Шария,которые вам поперёк горла или закон об ""коллаборационистах"" тому подтверждение.  
Я был у вас и в конце 80х и в 90х,и уже эта бандеровская гнида поднимала голову тогда.

Для меня Украина-это вот эти люди,вам которые не по нутру.  
Люди по всей Украине,миллионы их,люди с ДНР и ЛНР.

Ни племяши мои,ни братья счас в этом говне под названием ваша армия не участвуют по счастью.  
А если бы пошли,не простреливали бы ноги военнопленным.  
Подобные тому что на видео-это плесень земли украинской,моей земли тоже.

Using Soviet era weapons, equipment, tanks, aircrafts, newly enlisted soldiers ( teenagers, security guards, teachers, plumbers, policemen, old soldiers, etc ) to fight a much smaller Ukrainian army (composed of civilians, teenagers, old men, old soldiers, women, etc) and also volunteers from all around the world ( this includes snipers, ex soldiers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, a huge amount US soldiers -that claims to be volunteers). Russia has foreseen this and planned this along time. What Russia didn't expect is that a huge percentage of it's young and inexperienced soldiers are hesitant, has low morale, and refuses to fight, does not have the will to fight. Which makes the whole situation difficult to the Russian invading army. From what I read from an article, there's a huge percentage of  Russians moved/stayed/lived in Ukraine, they have families, relatives, cousins, etc. Also Russia didn't forsee members of NATO and g20 to donate thousands of  javelin, rpg, armor piercing ammunition to Ukraine which makes it difficult for the Russian tanks to fully penetrate every city and province in Ukraine. Bombing bridges, roads, blockade will be a problem to  logistics. Invading Ukraine without petrol, food, ammunition, etc will lower the soldiers morale and lose the will to fight.

Now Russia doesn't want to use it's best soldiers, army, equipment, aircrafts, tanks in the early stages of the invasion knowing that Ukraine doesn't have a huge army... that's the reason why they sent inexperienced young soldiers (teachers, guards, old soldiers) to Ukraine.

Russia has more nuclear warheads than NATO combined.

The west may push Ukraine to take that deal, to end this war and better prepare for probable future conflict. The sanctions will not be lifted, however, but Russia will be given oil and gas quotas.

As Russian economic situation worsens, Ukraine may try to hold a referendum in those southern parts to succeed themselves back to Ukraine.

""Hey, we're so awesome we'll invade this country with 225,000 active military and another 200,000 reservists with less than 200,000 guys and we'll be done in a few days .""

But, here are the factors that led to poor performance:

1. Lack of a professional NCO corps. It doesn't just lead to poor leadership, it leads to stuff like nobody really caring much about stuff like truck maintenance.
2. Reliance on conscripts. Always a bad idea unless your population is very small (Israel, Finland, etc.). Combine conscripts with low training (why spend money training guys you can't send to war) and you have a real mess.
3. Terrible logistics. Not sure if this is an endemic problem or poor planning for these ops. Either way, Putie literally sent his guys in with too little food. 
4. Corruption. Conduct ""training"" then divert the training funds, sell parts out the back door, etc. If I can buy Russian MRE's online and the boys in the field are getting stuff that expired in 2015...
5. Failure to follow their own doctrine. Russian doctrine involves use of combined arms and heavy artillery, and like Western doctrine, it requires tanks to operate with infantry support. They did none of this, and appear to have relied on a blitzkrieg effect (and Zelensky fleeing the country) to end things quickly. 
6. Underestimating the enemy and overestimating themselves. Sure, no leader in Russian thinks it's the glory days of the Red Army in the Great Patriotic War again. But they thought they were a first world military taking on a punk regime that they had handled twice already and that this op would go like their last four: Georgia, Syria, Ukraine '14 and Ukraine '18.

Russia is on the decline, their population is declining and Putin's actions since the Georgian war has caused them to be more isolated economically. This is combined with the EU overall moving away from fossil fuels which reduces demand for Russian natural gas.

China is different, if you watch how they are expanding their military, getting more aggressive on outer territories, and what they have been doing with the silk road initiative; yeah, I think that they could be a new world power and will be competing with US hegemony.

Why aren't we being more proactive? I don't think that our political and military leadership are the most competent (look at the Afghanistan capitulation), but they are definitely shifting focus on China, bringing semi-conductor manufacturing domestic, as well as other strategic industries; and I would credit the pandemic for giving them that kick in the ass to start taking supply chains seriously.

For example, all the countless wars that USA had waged against multiple countries around the world that did not have any direct threats to USA. I'm not sure if you are American or not, or pay taxes, but there are tens of million of people that disagree with the actions of the government, and one could say it would be absolutely moral to not pay taxes when your money is being used in a way that you see absolutely wrong.

Does anyone refuse to pay taxes and risk going to prison? It would be much easier for someone to not pay taxes and as punishment to go to prison, than for a soldier to disobey order during war and being shot as a deserter. It's not whether they ought to do this or not, it's could they? Or would it even make a difference?

Water plants, power grid, communication, fire and police stations.

No electricity in February-March in Ukraine means people freeze to death.

No water, people die from dehydration and disease.

Infrastructure is being preserved. This is not what an invading force that tries to kill off the population does. Even now in Kiev and Kharkov there is electricity and running water. 

As far as food, trust me, Russia has plenty of food to feed it's population, not to mention it's army. 

Sure there are troops that are cut off, or have not received a convoy for one reason or another, that's logistics issue, not food.

In this case, obviously Russian won the fight, hence they are probably well supplied.

The exact numbers of how often these kinds of events are happening can easily be propagandized, but they shouldn't be happening *at all* with a modern military. They especially shouldn't be happening with how little distance into Ukraine they've advanced.

Given the force disparity and financial availability, Russia should've *wiped the floor* with Ukraine. This *should* have looked like the 1991 Gulf War.

I can not stress how much of a disadvantage the Soviet autoloader system is.  The carousel setup for ammo dooms the tank to an explosive cook-off from a penetrating hit.  This means there's a high chance of a total crew lose, or not all of the crew being able to safely bail out.

This means that a crew who has experience is now gone, and all that experience is lost.  Russia can toss even more tanks at the enemy, but without experienced crews?

Another resource that is never included is time. Manufactoring smart munitions, tanks, and training effective soldiers takes time and they loosing it all in an instant due to effective asymmetrical warfare. And multisupport via military equipment and foreign legions.

Russia will try to cleave off south-eastern ukraine. They may succeed but Ukraine will probably keep most of what it has. I know that russia has had sanctions placed on it since the annexation of Crimea. -- though they are much heavier now.

The only worry is how effective russian nukes are. (Some people are starting to doubt that Russian nukes work). The reason for this is again it costs money to maintain nukes and keep them wholly  functional. Their nuclear program is comparable in budget to the UKs yet they have more Nukes than the  US military.
Something doesn't add up. Russia is desperate now and Putin has walked back on some of his demands as Ukrainians have inflicted more and more casualties.

Reports such as the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" are easily dismissed as happy stories being shared by a nation that needs an emotional boost, but the Pentagon is estimating 7,000 - 15,0000 Russians KIA so far. Thats more losses than the US took invading Iraq (including the invasions in the 90s) and Afghanistan. My assessment as some guy on the internet is that this has not at all gone to plan for the Russians. There was a clear attempt to try to encircle Kyiv. The goal was likely to force negotiations and enstill a regime more friendly to Russia. Instead the Russians have taken a few port cities and paid for every square mile with Russian blood and a massive amount of destroyed tanks and other vehicles.

TLDR: It's unlikely that we will find out what the Russians true goals were pre invasion, but it looks like they are trying to shift focus to the East so they can concur Donetsk and pretend that this is a great victory that went exactly to plan and that they are in fact still the world's 2nd greatest military",23d8d02c5eda2d178741b449a8642924df973050,True,False,,,,,0,1648319849,,0,{},i28074v,False,t3_tosw3q,False,True,t1_i27y4hh,/r/war/comments/tosw3q/can_someone_please_explain_why_russia_is/i28074v/,1648319861,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648291049.0,

It won't happen too soon but I do picture Puti. losing power within next 5 to 10 years. And either a successor (Which isn't always a bad thing), or opposition leader stepping in, die to economical pressure. 

Oil always necessary, so I picture oil business being strong.

&gt;  
&gt;The invasion of Ukraine was large enough in scale the the Russians had to use more of what makes up the majority of their military, and that is Soviet leftovers.  
&gt;  
&gt;There was also very poor logistical planning as we've seen unfold over the last several weeks. The Russians, and to be fair most of the West, thought the Russian Army could hit Ukraine fast and hard, taking Kyiv in under a week (some reports are saying 72 hours was their goal). This did not happen and the Russian Army did not adapt to having to resupply their entire force.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Russians also underestimated the resolve of the Ukrainian people and the scale of the international response. In their last invasion of Ukraine the world mostly condemned it and dished out a few minor sanctions while providing the Ukrainians with non-lethal aid such as blankets. The West realized the ineffectiveness of this strategy and has been supplying the Ukrainians with lethal aid and training for years. This has shown to have drastically increased the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainians.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia is still a super power because they have enough nukes to end humanity several times over and arguably the most advanced missiles in the world to deliver them. However, their conventional military has lost a lot of respect on the global stage due to their ineffectiveness over the past month.

Well, firstly, they didn’t write anywhere that they should capture Kyiv in 72 hours. It could only be captured by completely destroying it. And if you see it was not part of the task. At the 1st stage, the main task was to block 100-000 troops near Donetsk and force them to surrender and also destroy the nationalist battalions near Azov.

The invasion of Ukraine was large enough in scale the the Russians had to use more of what makes up the majority of their military, and that is Soviet leftovers.

 There was also very poor logistical planning as we've seen unfold over the last several weeks. The Russians, and to be fair most of the West, thought the Russian Army could hit Ukraine fast and hard, taking the Kyiv in under a week (some reports are saying 72 hours was their goal). This did not happen and the Russian Army did not adapt to having to resupply their entire force. 

The Russians also underestimated the resource of the Ukrainian people and the scale of the international response. In their last invasion of Ukraine the world most condemned it and dished our a few minor sanctions while providing the Ukrainians with non-lethal aid such as blankets. The West realized the ineffectiveness of this strategy and has been supplying the Ukrainians with lethal aid and training for years. This has shown to have drastically increased the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainians.

&gt;Research it further than surface level, some of the places bombed just can't be explained as accidental.

Do I need to explain that bombs can miss their targets? Or that Intel can be bad? Or the fog of war happens? Or that capitalists don't like wasting $50,000 on a bomb to be dropped on a target with no real value?
