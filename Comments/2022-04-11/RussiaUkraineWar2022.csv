I think that would depend on how bitter the fight to be the next Dictator would be and how much of a distraction the new leader would need.

Шок! Трагическая история из Макарова: чеченцы жестоко убили женщину, не успевшую эвакуироваться 

Детали: Татьяна Задорожняк с 2012 года проживала в Макарове Киевской области с мужем и собакой.

Три года назад, 16 марта, болезнь забрала жизнь ее мужа. В этом году 15 марта кадыровцы жестоко отняли жизнь Татьяны.

Когда в поселок вошли кадыровцы, Татьяна в своем доме ждала подругу, с которой они должны были уехать. 

Один из оккупантов вывел ее в соседний дом, где насиловал, а потом жестоко зарезал.

Никто не знает сколько дней мучали женщину. Ей не могли прийти на помощь, потому что местных жителей собирали и запирали в подвалах по несколько человек, а тем, кому удалось остаться дома, нельзя было даже подойти к окнам - сразу же раздавалась автоматная очередь.

Позже люди рассказали, что насильника убил российский солдат, а Татьяну похоронили во дворе этого же дома.",437e96fe1bb826220840abb174dc9717b079db8d,True,False,,,,,0,1649685560,,0,{},i4amaeh,False,t3_u0iafw,False,True,t3_u0iafw,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u0iafw/ukrainian_hachiko_a_dog_reini_from_makariv/i4amaeh/,1649685574,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649656760.0,

You can't grant Donbass or Crimea or anywhere else pro-foreign autonomy. That is naive to the extreme. There are a lot of fake articles but 5 mins research can tell you which threads end ubruptly and which ones continue to be reported on. Far more than just the ""western media"" are united on the issue of Ukraine. Any way you look at it, no matter who you are, putin has taken irreversible steps that will leave this world worse than he found it. People have likened him to Voldemort because the literal words coming out of his mouth sound like voldemort. Nobody made that up. From the very first day of putins 'special military operation but really invasion', the tone of the conflict has been set by verifiable fact. Like the fact that Russian state media has been pumping out the nonsense like a fire hose. ""President zelensky has fled ukraine"". Everyone else in the world knows zelensky remained in Ukraine and expects able bodied men to do the same. ""I need ammo, not a ride"".

However there seems to be three different types of fatigues being worn by the group, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was a Russian crew trying to work out how to get their tank up that embankment as it looks really angled.

From what I've seen of the Ukrainians they all appear to be kitted out much the same when it comes to their fatigues. Minor  changes to the webbing and BP gear as it's kinda BYO and otherwise for alot of the volunteer regiments and the donated kit can be spotted a mile off.

The Russians seem to have multiple different fatigues in play as their forces have been outfitted rather poorly. In most videos they are also seen with little discipline such as this, all clumped together without gear and random bags. 

Could be either, but it makes more sense to my brain if this was a sneak attack on an otherwise, distracted, Russian crew. If this tank on the left was doing anything but not running there would still be a crew in it, and it looks like we have everyone outside 'brainstorming' their fuckup.",0c3db5cf9ef1b39df80616fc6313141e9bc68f39,True,False,,,,,0,1649666849,,0,{},i49rk97,False,t3_u12wjs,False,True,t1_i49qxkn,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u12wjs/ukrainian_warriors_shot_a_group_of_invaders_with/i49rk97/,1649666865,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649638049.0,

But it's not going to be that way.  Even a string of perfect successes is going to present Zelensky with a very hard choice - how far do you go to restore and ensure Ukraine's territorial integrity?  Do you reconquer Donbass and Lugansk?  Do you attack Sevastopol?  Do you retake Crimea?  Do you launch a punitive expedition into Belarus to  change the regime there, and thereby secure the northern flank?

Any one of these operations could devolve into a bloodbath, with more civilian casualties than have been suffered so far.  If Ukraine loses its mobile armored divisions, Russia might be tempted to attack Kiev again.  Besides, we still don't know what conquering Ukrainian armies are going to do to the Russian-speaking minorities in Donbass and Lugansk.  We might be surprised by millions of Russian-speaking refugees fleeing for Russia, in the same way Germans fled East Prussia ahead of the advancing Soviet armies.  

And even if all of these attacks go perfectly, countries like Poland and Moldava might find their enthusiasm waning very quickly.  After all, a triumphant Ukraine might prove more dangerous to them than an imperialist Russia.  And even if Zelensky is sufficiently grateful to them not to even consider attacking, you don't know if that will be true of the man who replaces him in five, or ten years.

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Putin to be replaced.  Most of the German generals in the east considered the war as good as lost after Stalingrad, but the only real attempt on Hitler's life came in July 1944, a year and a half later, after a long series of military reverses, with horrific casualties.

If a soldier is rocking a swastika in a red armband, they’re probably doing it cause of the implication that it’s a Nazi symbol, not a Buddhist symbol. Likewise, it’s a bit fishy that there are photos of soldiers with the exact variation of the symbol that’s used by Nazis, as a patch on their arm, in a regiment that’s known by the public for having lots of Nazi stuff going  on:

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNdWe_nWUAMfhIS?format=jpg&amp;name=medium

(Both of them have it here. The exact variation, in the recognized colors. I’m sorry man, plausible deniability only goes so far.) 

And as to your other point- Okay, nationalism isn’t bad, but being nationalist doesn’t = being good either. The Nazis were fervent nationalists, for an example. It’s cool that they’re defending Ukraine, because Ukraine is worth defending, and I’ll support them for as long as that’s _all they’re doing._ But I’m really quite worried that if we keep propping them up, this fascist 4% who turned out at the last election that I keep hearing about, might grow? And I’m also worried that it might drive them to committing some horrible war crimes against civilians, especially Chechens, increasing the needless toll of this war. They’ve already demonstrated their hate for Chechen’s by literally greasing their bullets:

&gt; Something that can be hard to wrap our heads around is, treating these soldiers nicely after they surrender sends a signal to other Russians that it's ok to surrender. The rougher Ukranians treat Russians, the less likely other troops will be to surrender which is exactly what Putin wants -- sort of a baked in [Stalin era order 227.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_No._227?wprov=sfla1) it's outsourcing the regulation of morale and compliance of his troops to the Ukrainians' in a sort of proxy way if they don't act kindly to troops that surrender. If there is harsh repercussions if you surrender/retreat, you are less likely to do either. If surrendering/retreating seems painless, why wouldn't you? Especially if you're not entirely sure why you're there. Putin would LOVE for the world to hate Russians right now. That would give them so much purpose and galvanize them together. Ultimately it is Putins fault and his regime that put his military in the position it is today.

&gt; This is also a similar tactic that the Mormon church employs. The higher ups know that people are going to most likely be rude to them when they get woken on a weekend morning which can then be pointed at to probe how rude and mean the outside world is which keeps them in the Mormon faith. Same deal, just with war instead. Treat the surrendered soldiers nicely and more of them will surrender. If the goal is to stop the war and have as many Russians surrender as possible, it makes sense to use a strategy that actually makes more soldiers surrender, not just be a badass, even if they deserve mistreatment. 

&gt; The goal is to end the war, not be a badass. No one should bring their ego into this. That's what Putin is doing -- bringing his ego into the situation. It's bigger than any one person's ego so we have to think wider than just what they deserve. Giving them what they deserve doesn't take into account that people don't always act rationally even if we are justified. That is the problem here -- if they did, we wouldn't be in the situation to begin with so we need to think about things in a different framework that is as devoid of ego as we can get. Ego is how we got here in the first place and more in an effort to counter it will just feed the machine.",d3c51d50331812b77499c3ec42bde7559a7f9bf9,True,False,,,,,0,1649646443,,0,{},i48xvtz,False,t3_u0hzrq,False,True,t3_u0hzrq,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u0hzrq/ruzzian_pow_tells_other_servicemen_that_coming_to/i48xvtz/,1649646454,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649617643.0,

Incomprehensible indeed is the scale of such violence and violation. But trustworthy documentation of each act of atrocity is critical to bear witness to the truth of Russian aggression.

But on why and how this evil occurs, perhaps this linked article below from Human Rights Watch can educate us all better.

For rape is a historical and cultural tradition of the Russian military.

Healthy lovers become excited by each other’s desire, not each other’s suffering or violation.

But now consider why soldiers rape:

“Soldiers rape to subjugate and inflict shame upon their victims, and, by extension, their victims' families and communities. Rape, wherever it occurs, is considered a profound offense against individual and community honor.”

“Rape has long been mischaracterized and dismissed by military and political leaders—in other words, those in a position to stop it—as a private crime, a sexual act, the ignoble conduct of one occasional soldier…”

“In fact, rape is neither incidental nor private. It routinely serves a strategic function in war and acts as an integral tool for achieving particular military objectives. In the former Yugoslavia, rape and other grave abuses committed by Serbian forces are intended to drive the non-Serbian population into flight. Serbian forces rid villages of the non-Serb population by first shelling towns, then segregating men from women and taking the men to detention centers. Women either are left to fend for themselves in towns controlled by enemy forces or are taken in groups to holding centers, where they may be raped, gang-raped, and beaten for days or even weeks at a time.”

“Documenting where and how rape functions as a tool of military strategy is essential to counteract the longstanding view of rape in war as private or incidental.”

“Rape rises to the level of a war crime or a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions regardless of whether it occurs on a demonstrably massive scale or is associated with an overarching policy. Individual rapes that function as torture or cruel and inhuman treatment themselves constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.”

“Although rape is a sex-specific type of abuse, it generally functions like other forms of torture to intimidate and punish individual women.”

And that's what has commentators worried, because in reality one of these baby nukes could be used and produce devastation not-all-that-dissimilar from what traditional weapons would've otherwise produced (just over a longer period of time).  Or at least, the devastation might be greater, but more localized.

That's why the ""red line"" is *supposed* to just be the use of *nuclear* weapons - period.  Because once that line is crossed, then it becomes a much more abstract, uncontrollable escalation of ""ok how *big* of an explosion are we allowed to make?""

The fear is that, for example, Putin decides to bust out one of those tactical nukes to destroy the factory likely to serve as the last bastion in Mariupol, which would massively simplify what would otherwise be a prolonged and pyrrhic attack, as well as send a distinct message to every other Ukrainian city thinking of defending itself.

Communism doesn’t care about the individual or individual freedoms. Your just a gear in a machine in a communist country and your freedom, rights, or happiness don’t matter. 

There has never been a successful communist country that didn’t rely on the rest of the worlds free market. If you want to see what REAL TRUE communism is like to live in then your welcome to go live in North Korea cuz that’s the definition of a TRUE communist country and market. 

Socialism and communism are the same thing because both ideologies are identical and the government controls everything in both.

1. Were all ""Nazi collaborators in all European countries"" anti-Semites or was that feature unique to German/Austrian Nazis? Like were there qualitative/quantitative differences between the anti-Semitism of Hitler and Mussolini? Did they all have death camps and stuff like that?
2. Is it possible that a Jew could be a fascist? It seems like ""Zelensky is a Jew so he can't be a Nazi because Nazis were anti-Semites"" is a common line of logic I've heard but isn't the question whether or not Zelensky is a **fascist or far-right**? Like why couldn't a Jewish leader also be a fascist? 
3. I read that Zelensky imprisoned 11 of his rival political party leaders and that is one of the reasons that Ukraine isn't able to become a part of NATO since doing that undermines a legitimate democratic process and is a hallmark of autocratic behaviour. Is this true (or is part of this true)?
4. I read that the Azov Battalion in an extremely far-right group that formally separated from the Azov Political Arm in 2014 (some posit that they're still linked clandestinely despite their public parting-of-ways). It is estimated that up to 10% of the Ukrainian Military belongs to the Azov movement.

Research and donate what you can. Even 1$ helps and makes you feel better. This ""what we can do, we are only simple people"" attitude is wrong on many levels. This is what brought russia back to kleptocracy woven dictatorship and made this openly fascist war possible. Unfortunately wars can only be stopped by fighting.

Communism -&gt; No salary because everything is furnished &amp; controlled by government such as bills &amp; taxes. You receive few bucks for the gas if they provide you a car, but you are not allowed to buy one by yourself nor choose the model they give you.

Socialism -&gt; Salary in a competitive market between private corporations while the government keep a tight control over them. You buy your own house, you buy your own food, you buy your own clothes, you pay your own bills &amp; taxes. (Not such thing in communism, the local government does it, not you)

If you say communism &amp; socialism is the same thing, you are saying North Korea is the same as China &amp; Cuba. Absolutely false.

Again, in a socialist regime you buy your own phone, model &amp; operator. In a communist country, the country furnishes you *(if they say you deserve it)* one, same model, same size, same color from everyone.

Anyway, please educate yourself more except one Google research, the difference is very significant.

Communism: Radical equality, forbidden to have status, forbidden to have more property values, forbidden to have critical mind, forbidden to have different haircut than official ones, forbidden to wear anything different than what is provided to you &amp; so on. =/= Socialism being less extreme.

Real time, fact-checked information from a war zone is notoriously hard to come by, and even if we get the generally correct picture, that picture will be amended over time in many of its particulars. 

And there is a VERY big mismatch between everything Redditors declare to be facts and what independent news sources are actually saying. When Ukranian authorities take a group of Western reporters to a basement and show them the corpses of tortured and murdered civilians, for instance, they are at this point careful to use words like ""alleged"" and ""according to Ukrainian sources."" Some of these things (maybe most) will be confirmed over time, and some are likely to be fabrications. There's nothing wrong that process--that's normal journalism. What OP is talking about is how those caveats and qualifications get stripped away once people start repeating them on social media, and it's just ""Look, the orcs murdered more babies.""",9499b185d598db0ffa5ea971d0c72b199da05462,True,False,,,,,0,1649630010,,0,{},i47yyhn,False,t3_u0r7ol,False,True,t1_i47smi2,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/u0r7ol/whos_running_this_sub/i47yyhn/,1649630024,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1649601210.0,

This is the motivation to be as persuasive as possible and why it’s good to keep a questioning mind as we process all this stream of information

They are propaganda. Ukraine started some sort of nationalism program against Russia one or two decades ago, which completely turned people against Russia, and put their investment at great risk since they relied on Ukraine continuing to be a good dog.

All of which do not matter. Russia should have no control over any other country, especially former members who were forced to join at gunpoint.

The bottom line is, NATO does not even ask anyone to join. If someone truly feels threatened by that, they should ask themselves what kind of monster they are.

I'm not sure that Reddit posts are a great source of info either. And both sides are accusing the other side of faking videos, so how do you know who to believe? 

Russia (and Putin) claimed before the entire world that they weren't going to invade Ukraine but then did it anyway, which starts them off on the wrong foot as obvious liars. And I tend to give a lot more leeway to the country that's actually being invaded by outsiders, but Ukraine obviously uses propaganda and misleading info too, and while I personally don't think that entire videos are faked I don't think the descriptions of what we're seeing in videos are always honest. I don't doubt at all, for instance, that some of the civilian deaths pegged on Russia are actually Russian collaborators or Russian sympathizers in the disputed areas killed by Ukrainians.

Sanctions are not there to stop the war. It is already happening. Sanctions are not there to force people or elites to change their government. It will not happen. Sanctions are there to kick them in the nuts. To make their lives miserable. To punish them. Economical sanctions' purpose is to make Russia unable to rebuild their armed forces after the conflict (they will be to poor and will lack the proper tech). After Crimea sanctions kicked in, programs like Armata, Bumerang, Lavina LHD or even Su-57 became unfeasable. Now sanctions are so big, that russians cannot even build new tanks or trucks by themselves. Personal sanctions are to prevent ""mingling"" of oligarchs with western elites and corrupting the latter (they are unable to lobby, give and recieve favours). Every account frozen means that there are less resources to corrupt or make ""friends"" in west. Look at Abramovich's Chelsea. He lured british politicians to good ol' football game to talk and drink. And talk about concessions for Russia. Now he is unable to do that anymore. Phone calls and zoom meetings cannot replace face to face relations, especially when you are lobbying for something. Notice that all them oligarch kids in Europe had some (or been part fo) ""consulting"" company. What did they ""cunsult""? They were reaching out to western elites. To divade and conquer.

Every single night I had to leave before bed for 30 minutes so she could rock or she couldn’t sleep. She also seemed a little developmentally disabled in retrospect (not obviously/ maybe she didn’t pay attention in school…one time she asked me why hitler was a bad guy, and a variety of questions like that. Could be attributed to ignorance.) 

Her parents always kept her sheltered from drugs and alcohol. I smoked pot and drank occasionally, but I shit you not it was like after the first/second time she did either she wanted to do both every night all the time. 

She was also pretty short due to malnourishment when she was younger, when she was adopted her legs needed to be rebroken in the US because both legs were broke and just healed on there own

She was from a eastern Siberian village, honestly she was crazy, both hot and mentally, best sex of my life and highest/freaky libido, but over the years I have learned more about psychology and feel bad for her.

Russia will not stop until it secured the Dunbas region. At which point, Putin will declare victory.

The countries that imposed sanctions and voted Putin out of the UN Human rights commission will temporarily ramp up sanctions in protest, while other states will seize the opportunity to open up trade w/ Russia through back channels at favourable rates.  Sanctions will continue to erode as western corporations start to miss out on opportunities, and put increasing pressure on their respective governments to ease sanctions through “special measures”.

Those same countries will take Russia to The Hague, and charge it with war crimes. The previously frozen fungible assets will be used to pay the lawyers, and the remainder will be siphoned off to select companies (ie Halliburton) for the reconstruction effort. 

NATO will continue to strengthen its military presence to dissuade future Russian aggression. 

US and others will have several lessons learned in the postmortem. Big focus on Social media,  which will be more tightly regulated to defend against further information warfare from Russia.

With the war “over”, the kindness previously shown to Ukrainian refugees will dissolve, and nations will quibble over “refugee quotas”. 

Russia, China and India will form a more insulated economic “hub” to prevent catastrophic sanctions in the future, as each country seeks to en corporate smaller peripheral states (Taiwan). 

The EU will accept Ukraine as a “quasi member state”, without some of the core nation state rights. (Ie passport).

Hungry will slide further into Russian orbit, as Russia becomes its primary source of $$ going to leadership. 

Turkey will become a stronger player regionally, as it plays Russia off the EU and N. America. 

China looks to Russian/Ukrainian example to polish its plans to take over Taiwan, and becomes the next world focus.

They could do a lot of things to make ground and even get some support if the army had prepared both mentally and tactically for the war. It seems the army more or less just trains to make themselves look perfect for their parades in front of their capital.

Also looking at modern war and how today's soliders are trained. They tend to go for a more tactical stance. Travelling in smaller units and at times staying hidden is more feasable. you will have some scattered big groups that maintain positions. For a long time I was super meh... About both my countries army and the American army. But having a significant other in the military well yeah. The insane amount of tactical training made cannon fodder in our militaries, not a thing. (if it was a ww, we would probably have cannon fodder sadly)

But yeah, poor logistics, most soliders aren't tactically trained and essentionally just there to suicide themselves (not knowingly) just so the more tactical units can progress.
