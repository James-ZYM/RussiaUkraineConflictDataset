That's a bit like getting robbed at gunpoint with a bomb. Yes definitely not the best situation but on the other side what is he going to do? Killing himself also? That is a los los los situation for everyone especially the robber who didn't get what he wanted and killed himself in the process.

Only difference a robber might be mentally a bit more unstable and might not care about his life however is Putin really that ignorant of his population to kill them all and himself in the process just to show everyone he was serious? Who is going to care at that point? Everyone is death anyway and if there is a after life Putin will be remembered as a huge dick that killed his own population who aren't interested in war with ukrain in the first place.

The thing with nuclear weapons is if Everyone has them they kind of are no longer usable.
They are scary yes but on the other hand why would Putin use them even in the face of NATO capturing Russia?  He is a super rich guy, is what ever he is after really that important?

Even with mass public outcry, tyranny can persist, and therein lies the pertinence of the ""4 boxes of liberty"". All are necessary, but for some reason, people seem to consider only 3 valid and ethical. 

What I feel some misinterpret is that the 4 boxes of Liberty are not simply the means by which it can be secured, they're all necessary to the foundation of liberty, and so the maintenance of a free state. We seem to be kidding ourselves that only 3 are possible and valid, thereby destroying the entire concept, because without the 4th, the others carry no weight, and will naturally fail to remedy a crisis of liberty. 


The conclusion to this is that, revolutions only tend to come when a crisis has so deeply effected the lives of the majority of people, where there very survival on a cultural, national and individual level is called into question, and so violent means can be justified. The realization we should have from this is that, by paying attention, by being aware of the past, by being skeptical and observant, we can avoid needing to endure mass suffering and set our standards for what qualifies as a valid use of force within a scope that still maintains our liberty and wellbeing. To stop tyranny before it's gone so far as it has in Russia's case. That kind of effect can only come from within, the people, but the hardest part, and what is key in this definition, is convincing people living in relative comfort and peace that some things are still worth dying for. 


For liberty to prevail and flourish to the extent it should, that is the only way. For evil to prevail, it may only do so when this is absent. It all hinges on good men that are willing to die, and more, for an ideal that we consider essential to the human condition.  That has always been the cost, but by forgetting that lesson we pay a much higher price when we must relearn it.",0c208229dd950bea47d2131ef4867073c6b6b3c2,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645743936,,0.0,{},hyb2n9v,False,t3_t0egyr,False,True,t1_hyar3s7,/r/war/comments/t0egyr/peoples_in_russia_dont_wanna_war/hyb2n9v/,1645743952.0,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1645715136.0,,,

Most people interpreted this to mean Russia was going in to help separtists fight directly and are now saying Putin just lied as an excuse to invade.

But what I'm saying is I think putin's order was being clear... he wants to ""keep the peace"" and ""demilitarize and de-nazify"" Ukraine, aka destroy the military and remove people he thinks are nazis. 

He also wants to ""bring to justice"" the ""criminals who allowed violence to occur in donbass"", aka he's saying the Ukrainian government are the criminals and he's going to find them and (I think) either bring them to Russia to stand trial or just straight execute them. (Interestingly, US intelligence is saying Russia is making lists of people they want, so this seems to match up)

The only hope for Ukraine lies in three key factors:
1.) The Ukrainian military has been at war with Russian backed separatists since 2014, giving them more combat experience than their Russian counterparts.
2.) Ukraine is defending their homeland meaning they know the terrain and the areas they can easily defend, which will lead to dense fighting in some situations. They also have nothing to lose since their home and freedom is at stake.
3.) The vast majority of Ukrainians are very patriotic and heavily back the Zelenskyy government. Many have trained on weekends how to use various weapons systems from the AK-47 to side arms to hand-to-hand combat. This will undoubtedly lead to quasi ‚ÄúRed Dawn‚Äù cells of resistance across the country

Ultimately it will be impossible for Ukraine to hold out against Russia for more than a month but hope lies in guerilla tactics that utilize hit and run style fighting.

&gt;they need more men. more manpower.

&gt;they do NOT have it on their own.

They needed more anti air capabilities really but whatever.

&gt;eality check is Ukraine stands NO chance and very likely will lose a LOT of lives

Surrender is always an option.

Early in the morning there were reports that the soldiers moving to Kharkiv were the ones that went through basic training in December 2021. That means Russia still has a lot of high end equipment and veteran soldiers waiting.

They will soften up every resistance and move in - hard - very soon. The ukrainians will make them pay for every inch but it'll be very hard to hold them once they decide go all in. It'll probably be an attack from several sides at the same moment in Kharkiv, with forces from the north and south joining.

Should have come together to hold of vote for the autonomy of the people in the Donbass.

Crimea is a more complex &amp; arguably seperate situation &amp; should be treated as such.

I think the West and Ukraine should recognize Crimea as part of Russia.

Kind of hard to talk about solutions now that combat has again broken out...we needed to talk about solutions when the fighting was low scale for 7 years....

Everyone was happy to ignore the situation until the tide turned against their political interests.

Would have been nice to have this sort of Western media coverage for the people in Donbass during the last half decade. Instead all we heard about was chirps of a righteous struggle against Russian frogmen.

I think Russia wants to resolve this &amp; has acted.

If they begin to occupy strategic regions (specifically cities) outside of the donbass that's great cause for concern and regional tensions starting in Europe.

I think Russia will bomb military targets, maybe occupy a few airfields being used in operations but will primarily stick to the area controlled by the breakaway provinces.

I think the solution is for everyone not involved to back off, not itch to spill blood.

I been following this since 2014, I'm starting to think noone else even understands what's going on, it's just fear panic porn for the West.

I'm trying to remain unbiased but the sheer volume of deceiving information we get in the West is just so annoying... same bullshit with every other political war they get themselves into. 

The most surprising part about any of this is the amount of people that are blindly following the media driven narrative &amp; demonizing Russia whilst calling for war.

Within 24 hours almost all equipment and the entire airforce would have been obliterated &amp; you'd have 10,000 Russian Para troopers dropped into Kyiv as Russian equipment rolled towards the capital under air support.

Ukranian Nationalism is probably strong enough at this point and support enough that a guerilla type campaign would likely begin.... but Russia has extensive experience in this specific sort of Europea  type warfare. It would only be a matter of time before they became nothing but a nuisance.

I dont think Russia will invade Ukraine, honestly not worth it.

I think they will bomb all the military assets along the line &amp; command centers, factories etc that they know are connected to the war effort...they may even decide to destroy Ukraines airforce. 

After that I think they will stick to the territory the separatists controlled &amp; Ukraine will have to go on with the loss of area.

right now to be honest i think the rest of the world really doesnt give a shit.

they are worried but they are not gonna actually do anything to stop it

second Putin steps one foot in Poland however

then its like HOLY SHIT.

if it escalates to that the Ukrainian people have every right to be mad at the world for not stepping up sooner and doing something.

they could be seriously slaughtered and hundreds of thousands if not millions could be in serious danger

and yet so far no other country is gonna put troops forward in actually trying to stop the attack until one inch of Nato lands are tred upon

i think Putin knows this.  He may be nuts but he is not completely stupid

He knows they will sit back and do absolutely nothing  while he attacks Ukraine UNTIL he makes a move to any Nato ally.

by that point he would have a foothold in Ukraine and an far easier launching point.

this could be very very bad.  and it points me to the feeling i had over the last 4 years more and more about how we are called to sand up and fight for whats right and instead we stand by and do nothing.

sanctions wont stop Putin

seems no other country at this point in time is going to send in actual troops into Ukraine......and Ukraine as it stands does  NOT have the military force needed to stop the invasion.

it may be sound like a bad move but seems to me given that many of their family and friends are now in serious danger thanks to Putin many of them would glady rise up in arms to fight to save their homeland from his oppression.

not to desensitize the situation but lets say we are looking at this as a wargame or a computer sim or something like that.

russia is invading Ukraine.   ukraine does not have the miltary power to defeat russia........other countries are not yet willing to help out miltary wise in Ukraine itself (other then providing hardware and non troop aid) 

how do you really think its gonna play out without more support? Ukraine needs all the help it can get and it may just well mean its own people rising in arms against russia

Got what they wanted when it became convenient for their oppressors to give them what they wanted. Great men or no, they weren't fighting true authoritarianism that was dedicated to maintaining its grasp in the specific ways they were fighting against. The state's control and security apparatuses are much more advanced today as well, and information more easily manufactured or obfuscated. Under fully enacted oppression, where the democratic process has dissolved as it has in Russia, and largely in the United States in a different way, the voices of even a great body of the population are ignored. Occupy Wall Street may have even made things worse for us, to give one recent example. 



&gt;Mandela?



Largely due to outside pressure from the West, most especially the US, as a nation like the Apartheid government had created simply wasn't compatible with the modern world. Again, a matter of necessity and convenience rather than purely a product of public resistance. If the West did not pressure them, and the world not so opposed to a racial-hegemony, the Apartheid government likely would have continued and crushed the opposition. It's also hard to declare it a victory given the degradation of S. Africa post-apartheid, but that's another matter entirely. 


In a nation such as Russia, where the opposition is expected and accepted, where it can be absorbed, and where the government is resolute in maintaining authority and control, the people are not heard. Elections are falsified, political opponents are assassinated, protestors are imprisoned, the security apparatus silences dissent and tracks dissenters, and the people are disarmed. They have no power in their voice, and no power to commit violence even, due to the restrictions on privately owned arms. At a bare minimum for speech to work, the threat and capability of the people to enact violent resistance must be present, and it must be considerable enough to matter. I would consider it the only reason America has maintained some semblance of a political theater where we believe we have a voice. If we weren't armed, they'd drop all pretenses, act more confidently, and our liberty would suffer for it. They throw us a bone once in a while, but it's not because they're listening to us.",912d69da791cc9d5478f4e3c2b62daad83076d40,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645733045,,0.0,{},hya9pjz,False,t3_t0egyr,False,True,t1_hy9vzrq,/r/war/comments/t0egyr/peoples_in_russia_dont_wanna_war/hya9pjz/,1645733062.0,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1645704245.0,,,

In germany, we sent thousands of planes dropping tens of thousands of bombs to level an entire city just to destroy a munitions factory in it. We did that to make sure we got it. If we then dropped one bomb like we can today we would probably just miss. If it even got there because we lost almost half the planes we sent out.

Hiroshima and nagasaki were different. One plane, probably just a scout thinks the enemy. Then it does as much damage as 10,000 bombers over dresden. Unbelievable. Literally, they don't believe it.

This is why tyrants are allowed to run amok. Obviously I can't advocate for the obvious on this site, but ""peaceful demands"" to a dictator that subverts the democratic process of his own nation fall on deaf ears. Peaceful demands only work when your voice is heard and has an effect. To authoritarians, they mean nothing, and will only get you arrested or worse. The people must take action when their nation's leaders need to be held accountable. Even just the continued routine for survival will be aiding the war effort against Ukraine. People protesting in the street, but still complying with the ""law"" and going to work are aiding the war effort. I won't hypocritically say to let your family starve for your ideals, or engage in violence and die, but at least be honest and recognize the real impact you can have, and what does and does not work.

But i get why no one wants to help. We are not contractually obligated to do so and no one wants to pull the rest into a huge war. No country leader would want to be the first one to risk his entire countries well being and the well being of every other country that would automatically be pulled into this war.

The best would be some country still entering that war and then pulling the others into it. And i don't actually think the citizens of Europe would be against participating against russia.

USA needs to turn away from Europe and face China. Putin knows it, therefore he decided to present Americans and their allies his terms now. They can't go face China until he let's them.

&gt;What is in your opinion the worst that can happen in let's say France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Benelux?

Internal problems. Catalan or Basque separatism, social problems leading to social conflict, immigrants that did not integrate themselves in to society, aging population, shrinking foreign markets taken over by Asian competition, incompetent leadership that degenerated in to mere bureaucracy without vision and phantasy.

I really don't think this justifies anything at all period. A madman remains a madman indifferently of his role.

&gt;What propaganda? Mind elaborating? They aren't playing the victim card here. They just want to protect the sovereignty of their country. Putin has made it clear that their will be no civilian casualties, and I won't point fingers until independent non-governmental bodies tell me otherwise.

You mean the little council-thingy that supposedly was broadcasted live at a different hour than the deputees' watches indicated? Well that's just honest discussion and not at all planned, calculated propaganda and ad-hoc built justification, doesn't it?

And rocketing cities will surely not harm anyone, I'm soooo sure, I mean who would not believe Putin?

&gt;Russia invading Ukraine does no harm to us, in the same way that Saddam Hussein killing his people did no harm to us. If we stopped interfering in other people's bullshit, we'd be in a much better place. I'm not saying that Saddam Hussein was doing the right thing, but looking at the state Iraq is in right now, and having talked to actual Iraqi's that live there, they all say the same thing, life under Saddam was much better than the hellhole that is Iraq during present day.

&gt;The key here is to mind our own goddamn business. I don't care what my neighbor is up to, as long as his dog isn't shitting on my front lawn every morning. And right now Russia is not shitting on our front lawn, and neither was Saddam Hussein or Moammar Ghaddafi.

War does harm to everyone, involved or not. How things were handled is a different topic and I can agree on that, but one thing is war between different sides inside a nation, another is military invasion of a sovreing country from another sovreign country. It is NOT acceptable, and is a violation of international law. Ukraine is a VICTIM and Putin (Russia) is the perpetrator. I don't intend to ""mind my goddamn business"" on war. Even less so if war is inside Europe.

&gt;Mind telling me how this is mindset is any different from the what Putin is thinking right now or what his thought-process was building up to this conflict?

Man, if there is the need to explain why defending Putin is bad, I'm sorry to tell ya but you are mistaken and at best misinformed.",,,,,,,,,1645713727,,,{},hy8urof,False,t3_t082mq,False,False,t1_hy8mz8c,/r/war/comments/t082mq/is_nato_in_war/hy8urof/,,1,,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,,,,0,[],,1645684927.0,,[],1653245607.0

Try telling that to an ex-KGB agent who is currently the president of one of the most powerful (militarily) nations on earth.

&gt;Russa wants war because Putin needs war for propaganda, for solidifying his and his buddy's power, and shouting to the whole world how big their dick is.

What propaganda? Mind elaborating? They aren't playing the victim card here. They just want to protect the sovereignty of their country. Putin has made it clear that their will be no civilian casualties, and I won't point fingers until independent non-governmental bodies tell me otherwise.

&gt;Ukraine is a victim of modern day USSR. Ukraine is a free country that wants to remain free. Ukraine wants NATO because Russia means death and misery.

Ukraine is free to remain independent so long as they do not join NATO.

&gt;I'd rather Russa not occupy Ukraine, legally or illegaly, and just fuck off.

I don't know who you are, or where you're from. But as an American citizen, I'd rather not point fingers at others and claim they're wrong when I voted for presidents that have taken my people to war for their own selfish gains.

&gt;And as far as the US invasion things, i wasn't alive when it happened during the 80s, i was alive for Iraq and Afghanistan but too young to know or do anything. Problem is, saying someone does a horrible thing but another one has done one too, doesn't make things less horrible. I (personally) condemn all of those.

Russia invading Ukraine does no harm to us, in the same way that Saddam Hussein killing his people did no harm to us. If we stopped interfering in other people's bullshit, we'd be in a much better place. I'm not saying that Saddam Hussein was doing the right thing, but looking at the state Iraq is in right now, and having talked to actual Iraqi's that live there, they all say the same thing, life under Saddam was much better than the hellhole that is Iraq during present day.

The key here is to mind our own goddamn business. I don't care what my neighbor is up to, as long as his dog isn't shitting on my front lawn every morning. And right now Russia is not shitting on our front lawn, and neither was Saddam Hussein or Moammar Ghaddafi.

&gt;I just live in a different time period than the ones Americans did and Europe supported. **Now war is in Europe, and everyone should be extremely worried**

This situation is extremely different from the one Germany faced in '45, there is no one pushing through Russian borders, no intention of invasion on Russian soil. Russia is not cornered and all sanctions issued in the past 30 years are a consequence of Russian actions. I get historically Russia has been invaded numerous times, but never there has been a united Europe until a few decades ago and now there is no destabilizations inside Europe that can cause a renewed invasion of Russia. No dictators (except for Hungary, i'm sorry for you guys), no military expansionism, no cause for war. Russa wants war because Putin needs war for propaganda, for solidifying his and his buddy's power, and shouting to the whole world how big their dick is. Ukraine is a victim of modern day USSR. Ukraine is a free country that wants to remain free. Ukraine wants NATO because Russia means death and misery.

I'd rather Russa not occupy Ukraine, legally or illegaly, and just fuck off.

And as far as the US invasion things, i wasn't alive when it happened during the 80s, i was alive for Iraq and Afghanistan but too young to know or do anything. Problem is, saying someone does a horrible thing but another one has done one too, doesn't make things less horrible. I (personally) condemn all of those.

There a reason why no country wants to fight the United States, Russia &amp; China, including themselves but lets be honest, when either side is cornered with nothing to lose, I don't think they would think twice before launching their entire nuclear stockpile that is in active duty, and its not too far fetched to think that the days leading up to this supposed war, Russian, United States or Chinese military leaders would reissue their entire nuclear stockpile back into active duty.

Either way, I've said it before and I'll say it again. I'd rather Russia illegally occupy Ukraine than Ukraine join NATO. Russia is in an unfortunate position geographically that is has no other option but to ensure that it has protection of its border from the Ukrainian side. Yes, Putin is an asshole but if it were the United States, I doubt we'd do things differently, I mean we illegally invaded 2 countries under false pretense to protect our oil interests, I can't imagine what our military and political establishment is willing to do to protect its border.

You corner a bear, it has no option but to attack with full force and with Ukraine joining NATO, this is exactly what would've happened. Russia bordering eastern Europe is practically a perfectly flat playground. If Russia doesn't protect its border, then an invading force could practically walk into Moscow with little to no resistance.

Watch the episode on Russia by Geography Now and all this will make sense. I get that Putin has been having wet dreams about a unified Russia since the fall of the USSR but lets be honest, in this day and age, every country has the right to defend its borders to the best of its abilities. That includes neutralizing provisional and contingent threats.

TL;DR: I'd rather Russia illegally occupy Ukraine than for it to blow the entire planet to kingdom come

However, Russia only has a couple hundred on ICBM's that are capabale of reaching the U.S. 

This isnt new to the U.S., they have been defending against it since the Cold War. The U.S. has advanced missile defense systems, even many of their naval ships are capable of intercepting ICBM's in space. While its not realistic that every one will be intercepted, the U.S. probably would have some survivability compared to their European friends. With Europe being such close targets for Russia, they are in a far worst position. Many more nukes are more likely to hit their targets and can more easily be delivered via missile, airplane, or even ground vessels.

As far as Russia, they would obviously be targets, and maybe China depending on their stance.

So yeah the world as we know it would end.
