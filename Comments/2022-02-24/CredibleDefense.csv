&gt; Putin has no conventional ways of influencing Ukrainian politics anymore, while Ukraine is rearming and pledging to take occupied territories (and that includes Crimea) back by force, emboldened by Western support. Germany, France, and now the US haven't done anything to compel Ukraine to implement the Minsk agreements. Putin wouldn't have that. His concerns regarding NATO play into it as well, that's something that has been building up for a long time.

[Azulalbum](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/s7u7ha/why_are_things_between_russia_and_ukraine/htcj1pj/)

&gt; The occupation of Crimea thus began nearly immediately after the Euromaidan protests, followed by gray-zone operations on Donbas. While that grey-zone conflict has persisted, Russia has been losing ground: unsurprisingly, a gray-zone force that must retain some level of deniability is at a disadvantage to well-equipped force without similar constraints fighting in its own territory. Ukraine has spent the last 8 years equipping and training the Ukrainian army into that well-equipped force.

&gt; Hence, the need now to make a change in strategy.

But then you have the comment by /u/Strydwolf talking about Putin's desire to build a Russian empire, and that makes sense as well.

&gt; First of all, Putin and many members of his circle are extremely bitter about the outcome of the Cold War. They mourn the loss of imperial colonies in Eastern Europe, and have a major hate boner towards the collective “West”, specifically towards the US. Staple revanchisme. Second, Putin and his circle, but especially Putin himself dream of a new Empire, free from the influence of the “West”. This doesn’t only mean the recovery of the “lost lands” but also creating a sort of an autarky, mind that it doesn’t mean that this would mean any improvement of an average Joe Ivan, in many cases to the contrary, but what’s important is to create an independent, macroeconomically self-sufficient closed system/society that is parallel to the “West”. Third, Putin believes it is his own personal mission to achieve this, as he believes he has the required power and capabilities, motivation and that the time plays against him and his country.

BTW the significance of this airport is that it's airstrip was built for Mriya and buran so it's extremely hard to destroy it by artillery. that's probably why they tried to take exactly this one",71bbfc42c881baf95ed94094982e5b4d95f24871,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645738452,,0.0,{},hyaochw,False,t3_t0bkq9,False,True,t1_hyagx2s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t0bkq9/ukraine_megathread_february_24/hyaochw/,1645738467.0,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645709652.0,,

&gt;Few things to note in these really early stages.

&gt;Ukraine is urging people to not post about their troop movements or their actions that are taking place. Western governments will also be supporting that initiative. This is one reason that 'footage' will be so one-sided at the moment.


&gt;Russia has a lot of forces in and around Ukraine, but it's likely that they are not all pushing hard on all fronts at once. There will be lots of testing resistance in each direction, and deciding which front(s) to commit on.


&gt;While the battle is ongoing, neither Ukraine nor Russia nor the West have any vested interest in providing accurate information about what's happening on the ground. This is one reason the situation will appear so murky to the rest of us.


&gt;What Ukraine and the West will be very keen to do is show as much footage as they responsibly can of Russian forces invading and/or acting aggressively - especially against civilian or dual-use targets.

Simultaneously, the US and UK quietly inform Russia that if these ""peacekeepers"" are attacked they will give full support to the deployment without entering Ukrainian territory themselves, and if Polish or Lithuanian territory is struck in retaliation it would activate Article 5 and Russian forces *in Ukraine* would experience a proportional military response - but provide, for whatever it's worth, a guarantee that NATO forces will not violate Russia's internationally recognized borders. 

The ""peacekeepers"" would, at most, deploy to the eastern frontiers of Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi and Rivne oblasts, leaving a broad area around Kyiv and Odesa uncontested, in order to reduce the probability of accidental clashes between Russian and Polish/Lithuanian/etc. forces.

Essentially, a *de facto* NATO response without the actual formal endorsement of NATO - and without needing to wrangle Germany, Hungary and Turkey into line. It's responding to Russian ""salami tactics"" with salami tactics of our own. (Even an Article 5 invocation wouldn't necessarily trigger their cooperation - it only requires ""such action as [each NATO member] deems necessary"", and given the circumstances Germany might deem it necessary to send another sternly worded letter expressing their ever-deepening concern.)

* Indirectly support Ukrainian military operations by providing a safer staging area for logistics and troops,
* Ensure continuity of the Ukrainian government by providing a safe zone around Lviv,

I actually think that's a very very interesting point. I kind of disagree with you here.

Lets take Putin for example. I actually weirdly think he is rational in his own mind. Unhinged, but rational. 

So here is the way I explain that. The way Putin sees the world, he wants to be a dictator and autocrat. That is the highest priority for him. Staying in power. Because he is corrupt and if anybody else takes the reins, they may kick him out of the government and take his wealth. So he really has no option but to stay in complete control of Russia.

So that kind of puts him in a corner. He can't democratize the country otherwise people will vote him out. That means that he has to rule by fear. So he threatens people with death or violence if they go after him or if they are a threat to him. That also means that the country is a partial command economy and that the economy will not flourish. So it means that Russia has to leverage military might (or cheating rather than cooperation - game theory idea) in order to remain competitive in the international community. 

This situations becomes very unstable if Ukraine becomes a powerful, democratize economy on Russia's border. Because of the close culture between Ukraine and Russia, and their long history, if Ukraine becomes a better place, it'll be a serious threat to Putin's government. Imagine if Ukraine developed rapidly and Ukrainians were making 2X the money of an average Russian. Russia would have an immigration problem TO Ukraine. Additionally, Ukraine would be able to support a strong military that would be able to repulse a Russian invasion. 

The above reason is why Russia supported separatists in 2014. Not to gain territory, but to keep Ukraine's government unstable as to not threaten Putin's power. 

Since then, Ukraine has advanced faster (on the international scale) than Russia. It has gotten more western support and has aligned itself closer with the west. Again, making a new threat to Putin's power. So now Putin is in a bind. Keep a drawn out war, or a full invasion/occupation. The drawn out war seems to have failed as Ukraine has been largely successful at containing it. It looks like he decided it is time for a full occupation of Ukraine.

So that's the rational side of Putin. The reason he's totally unhinged is that a typical leader like Putin will easily cost their country 100 dollar to gain 1 dollar themselves. Or, in the case of Stalin, millions of lives to protect their own life.

And that's where we are at. An autocratic leader who will do almost anything to remain in power. One with nuclear weapons and a military and will likely be backed into a corner. Honestly, I think this whole situation makes it more than comfortably likely (maybe 50/50) that Nuclear weapons will be used in the coming years. 

Coming full circle. I do think the rationality is a good way to describe Putin, but you have to use rationality based upon Putin's selfish desires. Whatever those are. And if you look at governments in terms of their own rational selfish desires, a lot of these international politics start to make perfect sense. And that's why I'm not at all surprised that Putin is going after a full scale invasion.",,,,,,,,,1645722591,,,{},hy9huha,False,t3_t011qq,False,True,t1_hy7qneq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t011qq/nato_officials_say_russian_attack_on_ukraine_has/hy9huha/,,3,,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,,,,0,[],,1645693791.0,[],1653334196.0

Sure it does. It has an experienced military with plenty of modern-ish equipment, fighting on the defensive, with advantages in logistics. They may have a morale advantage - despite all the technological modernization there have still been constant reports over the years of poor morale and discipline among the Russian rank and file. Russia has not conducted a large combined arms operation against well-organized resistance since 1945.

People are pretending that it's 2003 and Ukraine is playing the role of Iraq. But there's much less disparity between the two sides in this case - or at least the potential for much less disparity; like military plans, the best military analysis lasts until the first shot is fired. Outnumbered and outgunned forces have had successful defenses in the past - the 1940-1941 Winter War comes to mind, where overconfident Soviet forces failed to achieve their objectives and Stalin had to settle for some minor border adjustments. 

The favored side doesn't always win.

* While the battle is ongoing, neither Ukraine nor Russia nor the West have any vested interest in providing accurate information about what's happening on the ground. This is one reason the situation will appear so murky to the rest of us.
* What Ukraine and the West will be very keen to do is show as much footage as they responsibly can of Russian forces invading and/or acting aggressively - especially against civilian or dual-use targets.

You (and I, for that matter) judge a country by economic prosperity and freedom. We see value in being a free, open society etc

But Putin sees the world differently - for him, Russian strength and independence is more important, even if that means less freedom and prosperity for individuals. Whether most Russians agree is hard to gauge, but certainly Russia has little or no history of freedom and democracy

Judging Russian actions through a prism of Western values and culture is always going to result in misunderstanding Russia's goals and motivations. A mistake we make regularly. We look at Russia and try to make sense of them by asking why *we* would do something, rather than looking at why *they* would do something

Putin appears to see NATO as a threat, and an aggressive/offensive pact not just a defensive one - and certainly there's an argument to be made that Afghanistan, Iraq (Kinda, not officially NATO but much the same actors), Kosovo, Libya, and Syria are not actions indicative of a defensive alliance. Whether that's just an excuse for doing what he wants is also hard to gauge, but imagine if 1989 had gone the other way and the USSR had started expanding it's borders first to France/Germany, and then was showing signs of inviting Canada and Mexico to join... do you think the US would be okay with that?

Yes, that *sounds* like an extreme situation, the USSR in Canada and Mexico sounds insane, but from a Russian perspective it's actually pretty accurate, with the only real difference being the Atlantic. 33 years ago Russia had a half-continent buffer between itself and NATO, now NATO is already on it's border and was on the verge of potentially adding another huge bordering country - Ukraine being a country which, for a long time, was part of Russia.

Again, through our western eyes it's easy to say ""Well Ukraine are a free country and have a right to self-determination, maybe Russia should stop bullying their neighbours and they won't **want** to join NATO"", but that isn't going to reassure Russia, who would feel much safer with some neutral buffer countries between them and NATO",,,,,,,,,1645712288,,,{},hy8reym,False,t3_szgefv,False,False,t1_hy556ef,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/szgefv/russia_outplayed_in_ukraine/hy8reym/,,11,,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,,,,0,[],,1645683488.0,[],1653231763.0

Just to be clear, Ukraine *does* have a pretty advanced space program so launch vehicles are not out of the realm of possibility.

The issue would actually have been timing. In much the same way as the US reacted to Cuba obtaining (soviet) nuclear weapons, Russia would be inclined to act towards Ukraine in a similar way.

So Ukraine would need to develop nuclear weapons natively (not impossible given the industrial base) but do it in such a way that Russia does not find out until a credible warhead and launch vehicle were in place. Further to this, to guarantee Russia still did not try anything, survivability to the extent of a second-strike system would also be needed. This is extremely difficult for any country to do, especially when time-pressured. Ukraine would also be unable to go for the best Second Strike option (boomer submarines) due to poor access to deep water oceans (and the immense difficulty of creating such submarine/missile combinations).

John Mearsheimer was a lone voice at the time when he suggested Ukraine should not give all the nuclear weapons back as there would be no way to become a nuclear power for a second time, without incurring the wrath of Russia.",,,,,,,,,1645697787,,,{},hy82npc,False,t3_sxuic4,False,True,t1_hy7xke7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/sxuic4/ukraine_megathread_february_21/hy82npc/,,2,,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,,,,0,[],,1645668987.0,[],1653138537.0

What if it's an in out special forces raid to sow chaos? Another consideration is that the Russians may have very good and specific intelligence on those assets. They've been planning and wargaming this for years after all. And with assaults from all quarters the Ukrainian command and control is likely overwhelmed. Then one has to consider the very real possibility of Russian assets within the Ukrainian military further disrupting the situation. 

If the usefulness of the Kyiv airport for defense purposes has already been destroyed it might make more sense to contain the enemy forces there and concentrate instead on fighting the invading land forces. While for the Russian paras just sitting there until the war is over is possible. Even if they surrendered at some point it'd just be waiting for a while while being troublesome POWs.

In the realm of cyber attacks often attribution is not ""clear cut"", especially in the short term. Standard opsec is to attempt to obfuscate the origin of the attacks for a variety of reasons, not just to prevent attribution. Nation state actors generally would have this capability and I see no reason they wouldn't use it. 

Note I say attack, not warfare. Conceivably in open warfare the attacker wouldn't cover their origin but given how advantageous it is to do so, and how standard the practice is, I don't see why it wouldn't happen. To my knowledge we have not seen real world examples of open cyber ""warfare"" between nation states so we don't have real world examples to confirm that theory and I don't run in circles that game theory that sort of thing. 

The timeline of ""recovery"" from a cyber attack against water or electrical infrastructure is really impossible to talk about without knowing the scope of the attack. My knowledge is limited mostly to the US and Canadian electrical grid and to a lesser extent water systems and with that in mind there are a few things to consider. Large parts of the water and electrical are run by relatively small utilities. Generally the smaller the org the worse the ability to prevent and respond to cyber attacks but the possible impact is also limited by the size of the utility. The other thing to keep in mind is that the landscape has changed a lot since the Russian cyber attacks against the Ukrainian power grid in 2014. A lot of money, time, and effort has been put into the security of the power grid especially since then. Water less so but that is starting to change. In your scenario you mentioned casualties and you might be imagining attacks causing reactor meltdowns or some other large impactful event but by their nature these are some of the most well guarded systems with multiple safeguards in place. (Although of course we have seen those safeguards also being compromised in attacks) 

If a cyber attack did cause a large impact then of course possible responses could be anything up to and including transitional warfare but I can't speak too much to that escalation process. I would point out that those sorts of cyber attacks would invite a response in kind. I have seen arguments that western countries have a much greater attack surface than say Russia due to how networked the grid is and I think there is some merit to that. However we have evidence of the cyber capabilities of various western countries and you would have to assume they would have the ability to respond in kind to any large scale attack against infrastructure.

While It is likely Russian asymmetric action might occur, the general assumption is that it would be seen as proportional. For instance, the Skripal poisoning was not a widespread use of nerve agent, but a targeted attempt to kill a traitor.

While not according to Robert’s Rules of Order, the Soviet/Russian state has always asserted violent assassination as the appropriate punishment for being a traitor. That practice is rules of the road for the Russian intelligence service, even in a somewhat non-permissive environment such as the UK. The UK retaliation, aided mostly by the U.S., was focused on disrupting Russian intelligence operations (proportional). 

Additionally, cyber operations generally would have the ability to scale effects. Minutes to days impact for instance, which is why cyber has great flexibility versus kinetic destructive attacks.

The Wilson Center is a credible source, and the authors of the article are experts in the topic. But I must mention that the authors are both from Ukraine, so remember that if you are looking for biases. 

&gt; Russia’s tactics in the conflict, then, demonstrate continuity. What did we see from Ukraine? Unlike Russia, Ukraine long ago started preparing for a full-scale conventional war, as evidenced by its efforts to achieve adequate military parity with Russia. For example, the number of combat-ready Ukrainian ground forces increased from a mere 6,000 troops in 2014 to 150,000 by the end of 2021, and 2022 plans focus on recruiting 130,000 reservists into the newly created Territorial Defense Forces. In any major confrontation with Russia, however, Ukraine undoubtedly is a weaker actor in terms of its human, economic, and military potential. Thus, to survive in a long-term confrontation with a stronger adversary, Ukraine must develop effective asymmetric tactics.",,,,,,,,,1645670606,,,{},hy6rk00,True,t3_szzhbr,False,False,t3_szzhbr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/szzhbr/words_versus_deeds_russias_and_ukraines/hy6rk00/,,8,,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,,,,0,[],,1645641806.0,[],1652968042.0

I don't know what exactly you're talking about, but in the most prominent battle, the Battle of Debaltseve, Ukraine's army gave a good accounting of itself. It occupied relevant strong points, used indirect fire and artillery well, and defended occupied ground tenaciously. 

Russia had to routinely bring in reinforcements and equipment to eventually overpower Ukrainian forces. The last stage of the battle, where Ukraine had to abandon its equipment and humiliatingly, run away, was after weeks of intense fighting and at times, brutal close-quarters combat. 

I don't know what the status of the Ukrainian military currently is, but I would think it's significantly better.
