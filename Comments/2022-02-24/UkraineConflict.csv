You can’t say for sure that Russia will invade if NATO officially refuse Ukraine. Because no one can answer that since it didn’t happen.

No, if seen from Russian side:

1. Bucharest summit was on 2008. It was the trigger for Russia to harass Ukraine.
2. NATO refuse to deny Ukraine officially even though they are not eligible anyway.
3. Russia attack.

Anyway this is my last response.

NATO can’t do shit in this situation but they also refuse to officially announce that Ukraine will not be NATO member which will save Ukraine civilian.

You have to tell me what question I missed if you want me to answer it, comrade. 

&gt;I don’t support Russia but I understand why they did it.

So do you understand why Ukraine wanted to join NATO? 

Also, given a number of NATO nations border Russia, why is Ukraine different?

&gt;Did you do something when US invading Iraq too, protest on the street to stop it? 

I was a teenager when the Iraq war started. Even then it became clear pretty quickly that the war was unjustified and the reason invented. Not all of us support our countries actions unquestioningly. The US has plenty of blood on it's hands. 

My point though is that per your reasoning the US was justified. 

&gt;ooo holy saint righteous man?

???

&gt;Yeah probably I wished at first. But I will regret it because they won’t allow me to join while the whole thing cause Russia to invade.

But Russia would've invaded anyways. So why blame NATO or regret trying to join?

&gt;Lol every war has civilian casualties but it was never the intention to kill civilian.

It doesn't matter what the intention is. When you engage in a war you are doing so with the understanding that there will be civilian casualties. You are choosing to accept that you are murdering those people.

&gt;And US waged war also has civilian casualties so why US allowed and Russia is not? What makes you so special?

When have I said it's acceptable for the US?

&gt;Sure I did said that. But there is no official statement if they will not join. For Russia that mens they will join. 

Yes, again, Ukraine and NATO are plainly working towards them joining. 

&gt;Because it is simple, if they won’t join then if NATO won’t announce means they are challenging Russia resolve.

No, it means they are trying to protect themselves from Russia. 

You seem to be struggling with this. Ukraine wants to join NATO to protect themselves from Russia. Let me break it down simply for you.

1) Russia is aggressive towards Ukraine and funding separatist movements

2) Due to this, Ukraine wants to join NATO

3) Russia attacks Ukraine for joining NATO.

**Russia** is the problem. They are the aggressor. If they were not actively fucking with Ukraine, they would not have wanted to join NATO in the first place.

I never said that at all. Stop making shit up.

&gt;You’ll never know what response US will do in that case. I’m not like you being sure 100% of something you actually don’t. 

""You can't say for sure that the US wouldn't invade Mexico so therefore it's okay for Russia to invade Ukraine!!!""

&gt;US has murder countless in Iraq with false accusations, I won’t be surprised if they do it again if Mexico really make a pact with Russian.

So you support Russia invading Ukraine by making things up but not the US invading Iraq? Why?

&gt;You can guess where I come from as you liked. It doesn’t matter to me. I could tell you a lies and you won’t know the truth anyway.

Da, comrade.

&gt;Yes sovereign nation will be left alone if it doesn’t threaten if it is then means war for the Russian. The fuck you don’t understand?

Russia has threatened Ukraine for decades. You're saying Russia is justified by acting in the interest of their national security, but Ukraine wants to join NATO in the interest of their national security due to Russia being aggressive. 

Why is Russia allowed to murder Ukrainians in the interest of their national security, but Ukraine isn't allowed to protect themselves from Russia in the interest of theirs?

&gt;By the way missed to reply a point on a long written reddit post is part of functional human being.

This doesn't mean anything.

&gt;If I’m Ukrainian I wouldn’t be happy of course but I will blame NATO because they can simply avert the war simply by declaring that my country is not going to join NATO. 

Except if you were from Ukraine you'd want to join NATO so you'd be safe from the Russians. 

Also, you'd probably blame the people gunning down your mother and turning your family into bite sized human chunnks.

&gt;In reality it is not eligible anyway. 

That's the whole point of the process of joining NATO, to work towards eligibility. How are you so poorly educated about all this? Russian propaganda in schools?

&gt;Don’t say they want to kill civilian because they don’t it is a lie. 

They're deciding that it's worth killing civilians. 

&gt;Civilian casualties is always there in every war, even those waged by the US too.

""Well the US did it!"" isn't an excuse. 

&gt;I never run am I and I even try to reply to missed question. Stop this useless provocation. It just shows that you are frustrated and try to attack me personally.

I'm very clearly attacking you personally because you are morally inept and support the death of civilians in the name of Russia expanding it's territory. 

&gt;Yes I said sorry I don’t word it good enough. You just attacking me by my weakness in English. 

No, I would never criticize someone for their poor English, I am not even conversational in a second language so I have no place to mock someone for not knowing a second perfect. 

Rather, I'm calling you a liar. What you said wasn't poorly phrase, it was clear - Russia will not invade Ukraine unless they join NATO. You're not so bad at English that you got this mixed up with ""Russia won't invade if NATO promises not to accept Ukraine"". You're just a weak man who lacks integrity and morals.

&gt;But it is clear that the Ukraine direction is towards joining NATO. If not then just announce it officially and end the war. No announcement means the intention is there.

Yes, obviously Ukraine intends to join NATO and NATO is willing to help them get there. Russia doesn't get to tell Ukraine they can't protect themselves against Russia. And the idea that Russia would pull out if NATO capitulated is hilariously dishonest or just stupid - Russia is invading because Putin wants the territory plain and simple. You're acting like Russian propaganda is the real reason.

Again, it's this simple - you say Russia is justified because your country is acting in the interest of it's national security by avoiding having Ukraine join NATO. But Ukraine only wants to join NATO to have protection from Russia. 

Why is Russia justified in murdering Ukrainians by protecting their national security, but Ukraine isn't justified in joining NATO to protect theirs from Russia who have been aggressive to Ukraine well before they wanted to join NATO?",1e0816b956e0575ab898a31c5930ef32ad1faeac,True,False,,,,,0,1645715331,,0,{},hy8ypy0,False,t3_svu0t1,False,True,t1_hy7no6d,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/svu0t1/watch_biden_provides_an_update_on_the/hy8ypy0/,1645715346,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1645686531.0,,

No Russian is not justified to kill civilian. But they apparently they think they are justified to take over the territory. Don’t say they want to kill civilian because they don’t it is a lie.

The proof is that you said something objectively incorrect. What other proof do you require, friend?

&gt;I will not be so sure with your answer. If Mexico allow Russian to install radar there it means they declare themselves as US enemy. If not doing prevention like what Russia doing and even if not immediately but eventually US will attack **even not by means of war. **

Whether or not a country murders people is actually pretty important.

&gt;I would not disclose my info to insignificant someone on the damn internet lol. Are you really expecting me to answer this?

Yes? I'm from the US. US is big so I'll even specify the northeast. I'm not asking for ""your info"". I'm asking what *country* you're in. That's not sensitive information, so I assume you're not actually an ""unaffected third party"".

&gt;No innocent people have to dies because NATO doesn’t want to write on paper that Ukraine will never be member and thus posed as Russian potential national security threat.

Let me be sure I understand you, because you sound like a sociopath. Because NATO did not capitulate to Russian demands, it is *their* fault that Russia is now murdering people? 

I'm pretty sure it's the fault of the country doing the murdering. Russia was not forced to murder people. They chose to. 

Was the Holocaust the allies fault because they wouldn't let up on the Treaty Of Versailles? 

&gt;For Russia yes apparently their national security outweigh the sovereignty of other country. Why sovereignty of other country outweigh Russian national security?

Because a sovereign nation literally means others don't control them? The fuck?

&gt;Oh now you believe in Putin words? 

Not really, just funny how poorly informed you are.

&gt;Also you have no right to order me to answer in one comment don’t you know that? What if I don’t? I want to hear this please answer.

Sure I do. And if you don't, I'll ignore the other responses. Just respond like a functional human being. 

&gt;Again they don’t invade to kill civilians. 

They are killing people. 

&gt;They wanted to take over the territory rather than taken by NATO. And it is basic of survival.

NATO wouldn't take over Ukraine. You have no idea what NATO is, clearly. 

If the country next to you - so, Ukraine probably - felt your country was a national security threat and attacked your home and murdered your family, would you smile and agree they were justified? 

Also you forgot to explain how this is different than the US invading Iraq. 

So you think Russia is justified in murdering Ukrainians because they weren't able to tell them how to operate their country? Yes or no. Don't run away. Stop being a coward.

And let's not forget the main topic here: you said Russia would only invade if Ukraine joined NATO, and you were terribly wrong comrade.",3e57245e1ece55fe6d86ea77c5666e014e4e1cb6,True,False,,,,,0,1645685101,,0,{},hy7keba,False,t3_svu0t1,False,True,t1_hy7j34f,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/svu0t1/watch_biden_provides_an_update_on_the/hy7keba/,1645685121,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1645656301.0,,

No innocent people have to dies because NATO doesn’t want to write on paper that Ukraine will never be member and thus posed as Russian potential national security threat. That is from Russian point of view. If you never want to see from the other side you will never understand.

For Russia yes apparently their national security outweigh the sovereignty of other country. Why sovereignty of other country outweigh Russian national security?

I'm not sure what I can do from here, except trying to raise awareness of the horrible, inhumane cancer that is putin, so I made this (helpful?) poster, outlining exactly what he is for whatever little this is worth.

It's a horrendous situation. I'm half tempted to get on a flight and try to make my way to Ukraine to join up with the resistance, but I've got no military training and no real idea on what to do. I'm supposed to be getting married in a few weeks, however this is leaving me feeling completely numb and ashamed.

It would likely morph into a protracted insurgency/guerilla conflict which would be a drain on resources and source of violence for the Russian side which does not serve their interest. No country likes having semi autonomous regions, but no one likes civil war either, and this has in definition been a civil war between those regions and Kyiv for over 8 years. Something has to give right? Let's say Russia never invades but continues to support militias in the region. I mean what does Ukraine think will happen? That given enough time, they will defeat the seperatists, take that territory back eventually, and everything will go back to being one big happy country? So then it becomes about either saving face and not wanting to give any ground up or protecting resources, land mass, transit routes, coast access, etc by holding on to those regions. 

I do think that all these recent actions on the part of Russia are part of a playbook, and that Putin knows exactly what he is going to do and not do and I do believe that they will have weighed the various reactions that they would encounter in the form of sanctions. It would appear that the Ukrainians are in response mode, meaning they are waiting to see Russias moves and then decide what to do. In American football its harder for the defense because the offense already knows what they are going to do and its on the defense to stop it. It leaves them very reactionary and thats not a great place for nations to be.  

I see the sanctions aimed at the NS2 pipeline, but that arguably hurts Europe equally bad, without a source to fill the void left by the shut off of Russian oil and gas, so while it sounds like a strong choice of action, I wonder in truth how impactful it really is. If Putin were to just turn off the gas, in the midst of winter, it would really hurt Europe. I am not saying that will happen, in fact I doubt it does, because again it would be a serious provocation. I only bring it up to point out that he has some leverage in that situation.

Again I wont presume to know the thought process and the feelings of people there, but it would appear from afar that those two regions are totally cool heading back to mother Russia, after all why would they evacuate to Russia if that were not the case? I dont want to minimize the threat of war as a motivator but it would seem that the majority in those regions feel the same way that you do regarding indepedance. The population seems in favor or at the least very non vocal about discontent.

If those regions were to receive their independance from Ukraine legally, could it end the conflict? I realize that the threat of Russia wanting more is real. If you give the mouse a cookie, hes gonna want a glass of milk. However, if the agreement were ironclad and both sides got concessions and approved, maybe it could be over. Again, I cannot emphasize the mutual agreement aspect and guarantee of security for both of this enough. This is assuming that the intentions on both sides are good, and actually are resolved to find a solution and not just rebuild the USSR. Based on the speech given yesterday regarding Ukraine being a false nation and a mistake, it would appear that Putin does in fact want all of Ukraine, or at least his comments would suggest he feels justified in taking it if necessary. I had wondered up until that point if it was truly just about those regions, but the entire speech basically confirmed that it is not just about Donbass.

If I were Ukraine, and I am not, I am just some random dude, I would leave it up to the regions to vote on it and decide for themselves. That way it could be shown in a public form that they do in fact want or not want to declare independance. Ukraine will still not like this because all they are getting out if it, is avoiding a total invasion where as Russia stands to benefit greatly. I also do not want to discount the strategic value of these locations from a civilian and military stand point. Maybe there could be concessions from the Russian side to Ukraine in order to bridge that gap.

We all know this will not happen though, on either side. No matter what happens here, Russia stands to gain either by land acquisition, weakening and ridiculing NATO and US, or by concessions.

The West has a pretty long history of engaging in changing other nations political systems, with violence is no red line here if it's for the cause of ""democracy"". Like Libya...

Russia has nukes - but look how fast technology evolves. Maybe 10 years from now, and there will be laser weapons, making ballistic missiles useless.

Actually, this case is not much of a different than the soviets placing nuclear missiles in cuba. And all NATO members are becoming large US bases, although they have to use terms like ""rotation"" to bypass agreements.

Biden is not really supportive here too. Becoming president, and the first thing he did was calling Putin a murderer, probably just to unite it's own very divided country. Although fact, a very destructive way of ""diplomacy"" - and just the US pointing fingers here is a really bad joke. What should a nation expect, of a ""defensive pact"" (actually acting pretty offensive over the last decades, since i don't know where e.g. iraq attacked us), lead by a guy like this?

In the actual crisis, there was need for mediation. Instead of that, Biden is pushing Ukraine to proudly stand it's ground - at it's very own cost, simultaneous saying there won't be US boots on ground...

I know Russia has been through a very tough period in most people's living memory but it's not someone else's fault it's 90% plus down to poor mismanagement by Russian leaders for at least 150+ years. 

Russia's potential in the 19th century was undeniable and much of the literature of the time recognised Russia and the US as the emerging great powers. But what happened? Russia is now a backward resource export state with an oversized weapons program and an economy the size of Australia with six times Australia's population.  Russia is a country experiencing demographic collapse and deindustrialization, with a manufacturing industry (outside of weapons) which is obsolete and failing.  The standard of living in Russia for anyone not in the 1% is abysmal and hopeless. 

Russia could have transitioned from a command to capatilist economy successfully like China in theory, but practically the capacity of Russia's government to so so and to be frank their competency was non existent. Effectively the wealth of the state instead via corruption on a breathtaking scale moved into private Russian hands and those wealthy and in power blamed the west for this self inflicted crime and somehow (probably due to poor education standards/ understandable desparation) the Russian people believed these blatant lies and continue to do so. 

The jingoistic misadventures of Putin in the former Soviet republics don't reflect a russia on the rise but the last death throes of a terminal Russia in decline.  Historians of the future will look back on this moment as the desperate actions of a failed Russia that will tear itself apart over the coming years/ decades, or if you are lucky (at least in the long term) the moment where Putin's failures fully manifested and the Russian people finally woke up and started a move towards a better future. Either way though, unfortunately, the Russian people will continue to suffer much like they have done for centuries and I pity and empathise with them.  I just hope that in its last gasps for relevancy and life the current Russian regime doesn't drag the rear of us into the shits with them by doing something irreversibly stupid.",1d7f67c790c2290c6fb432ab64e705c1d6b4c5c5,True,False,,,,,0,1645647681,,0,{},hy57xb1,False,t3_sz8uiu,False,True,t1_hy50n52,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/sz8uiu/response_from_us_and_others_seemsweak/hy57xb1/,1645647696,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1645618881.0,,

It's a modern day siege. Assuming they aren't 100% self-sufficient, buying food, medicine, etc is going to get more and more difficult and painful.

Thanks. Well, it's all just my opinion and observation - although I am in the Canadian finance industry, I have no involvement with international finance. On my journeys throughout Russia, I would say that the Russian people are as always the ones to take the punishment. Outside of the few major cities the country is a shithole because the kleptocrats have exported all the wealth to external holdings rather than allowing the people to share in it. The current tack of western governments sanctioning the oligarchs and freezing their funds and shutting down their banking transactions (except where they are repaying debts to the west) seems in my mind the best way to deal with this, alongside more visible but perhaps not quite as effective tools as preventing the export of any technologies or luxuries to Russia.

It's a messy situation and if Russia doesn't get rid of Putin and his cabal of mafia thugs and replace them with more representative government then I see this being a long slide and most of Ukraine being retaken while Russia languishes outside the G10 and maybe even G20 eventually. 

As to the kiddos of the kleptocrats, I agree very much in that while Putin is certainly a multi-billionaire, he doesn't personally hold any of it. But it still has to be held somewhere safe, and that's not Russian banks in Russian rubles. So it remains accessible to the western sanctioners.",63f3e9f3021b24396cade45875567d8dfb335ab8,True,False,,,,,0,1645638602,,0,{},hy4k8c9,False,t3_szlflb,False,True,t1_hy4hgwb,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/szlflb/are_sanctions_really_going_to_do_anything_to/hy4k8c9/,1645638613,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1645609802.0,,
