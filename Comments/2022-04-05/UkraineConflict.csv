Clear evidence how Ukrainians are shooting POWs in the foot, bashing their heads etc. and Russian treating their POWs humanely.
And yet people want to believe Russians were randomly shooting civilians with white armbands which were found 4 days after russians have left, in the meantime for 3 days nobody knew about the bodies, on 2nd day some bandit asks the other bandit ""those who are not wearing blue armbands, can I shoot them?"" Yes was the answer.

It would be believable if they didn't have 8 years of violent history of not giving a shit where the bomb drops.

First of all, you shouldn't make your blunders known to the enemy. The first thing Biden said upon the invasion is, ""our forces are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine"". What the fuck? To a genocidal dictator that's like sending a big, warm welcome with flowers. That's like chess 101: you place threats one step ahead such that the enemy won't make a certain moves. They did the opposite of that. If you see trouble in assigning MiGs to the Ukrainians, at least don't make a worldwide statement about it and then openly defend the decision. It just makes NATO look weak. They should have kept the empty threat in place.


Speaking of, it annoys me to no bounds the idiots on reddit and twitter who constantly reiterate ""please don't involve us in WWIII by sending military support to Ukraine"". While that may be the case, there's no need for YOU to come running and remind everyone of it. The world leaders themselves are aware of what/what not to do.

You will often find right-wing extremism in the military, grouped in specific units that became popular. This is not a unique thing to Ukraine.   


Is it good? Nope. It's a necessary evil for a country that has been at war since 2014 by a much more powerful ally and basically not having any significant military to resist. AZOV battalion and it's dubious soldiers did a job that nobody else did. Just like criminals have been sent to fight at the front for centuries, to clean their sheets and either die trying or defend their country.   


War is complicated. Ironically there are a lot of Nazi/fascist groups fighting on the DNR / Russian side against Azov, most notably Serbian volunteers, people from the Wagner group and various 'outlawed' Russian fascist groups (numbering in the 100,000 somewhere in 2010).   


It's very convenient to point at Azov, while we have evidence from for example a jewish journalist whom was embedded with them and noted ABSOLUTELY ZERO antisemitic behaviour or discussions. They treated him respectfully. What he did notice was a distinct amount of nationalism, even among the people who had dubious tattoos. They were ultra-nationalists much more than that they were anti-semitic or in other ways resembled Nazis.

But the number of photographers and journalists willing to go to the frontlines in this war is greatly reduced considering the Russian Army were shooting journalists and photographers dead or trying to kill them in the case of the Sky News team but of course that's a calculated decision on Putins part to not have any negative press about his army and its failings and methods getting out. 

If you voiced opinions about supporting Putin in most environments I'd imagine you'd get a similar reaction to saying Hitler was just misunderstood, however, unlike in Russia where if you held a pro-Zelensky protest, in the west you wouldn't end up arrested, beaten and jailed indefinitely. At least you have the right to shout support for Putin if you so wish. That's what makes defeating Russia in Ukraine important. 

This is only the beginning of Putins stated objective  to realign the world order by absorbing Ukraine and the Baltic States and other Eastern European countries formerly under Soviet rule back into his dream of a dystopian imperialist Russia devoid of freedom of expression and freedom of the press. A fascist state essentiallly which is ironic considering he said Ukraine was ruled by drug addicts and Nazis yet strangely has a Jewish president.

This vehicle looks to be the last type. No integrated fire control radar, just the racks and erector for the missiles. That isn't worthless, but you need one or both of the other types of vehicles to do anything with this one.

This unit is still valuable as a decoy or as a source of parts for other machines, but it probably wont be doing any actual air defense on its own. My understanding (which could very well be wrong) is that Ukraine doesn't have much in the way of ammunition reserves for these systems. Their problem isn't that they don't have TEL vehicles to carry them, its that they don't have enough missiles to fire them at all the targets they would like to intercept. If Ukraine can find someone willing to sell them more missiles (Russia obviously won't), then they might be able to make use of this vehicle. If they can't, then this unit is probably just a pile of self-transporting spare parts.

That's just needlessly creating friction at a time when Europe need to stand united. Everyone in Germany by now has understood that any appeasement aspirations towards Russia were misguided.

To have the term carry its full weight, though, they can't throw it around without significant proof. Genocide necessarily involves the intent to destroy an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group. The crime of ethnic cleansing, by contrast, just involves the intent to expel that group from an area. Other types of crimes against humanity might involve the same type of brutality, but not targeted against a particular demographic group.  


As far as the process, that's an interesting question. There is probably more than ample evidence to start a prosecution in the International Criminal Court, but its jurisdiction is limited, because Russia is not a state party to the Rome Statute of 1998 which created the ICC. Ukraine has signed, but not ratified the treaty.

It’s about Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova he wants them all under his Greater Russia. So he’ll just carry on. Putin is a chancer and the siloviki will not want to commit nuclear suicide by ramping up to using WMD.

Putin has three options:

1.	⁠carry on slugging it out and losing abysmally;
2.	⁠Negotiate (properly - not the current games to buy time and go with a false narrative);
3.	⁠Ramp up to use of WMD.

Then argument that if NATO gets involved and Putin goes nuclear is not as clear cut as it seems. Putjn has to survive, otherwise he’ll never achieve his desired pace in history. If he goes nuclear he goes down as the idiot who lost a war agaisnt a smaller neighbour and the man who ruined Russia. If he goes for option one, he just loses more slowly. But if he’s faced with NATO, he will jump quickly to Option Two.

However, NATO is not coalesced in the sense that it’s bound to support Ukraine and ensure Ukrainian sovereignty is returned, completely. NATO’s coalesced to defend itself only.  Indeed, agreement of all member states is needed to go into Ukraine. So far NATO has stood on the sidelines and some countries, such as France and Germany, have paid more attention to their self interests than Ukraine and Putin.  These are the appeasers Putin needs. Putin found the weak spots for NATO and one of those was Macron, all too eager to raise his profile at a time of national elections.  I think Putin has played NATO very well, up to now. But the latest atrocities (Bucha) might change the mindset of some NATO Member States.  Putin may find himself facing a coalition of some of the NATO Member States, at least one being a nuclear state, willing to support Ukraine outside the NATO envelope.",81a3f0b686e90893b17a2893cd7836b71cf0ac8c,True,False,,,,,0,1649089159,,0,{},i3da9j7,False,t3_tvwe87,False,True,t3_tvwe87,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tvwe87/former_russias_richest_man_discusses/i3da9j7/,1649089170,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649060359.0

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia planned to take Kyiv in three days. The Russian army bought 45,000 body bags and brought mobile crematoria. I am sure that mass executions were planned in Ukraine,&amp;quot; wrote German political scientist Sergei Sumlenny on Twitter.

&gt; As the political scientist emphasizes, back in 2021, the Russian authorities adopted a document on preparations for the creation of mass graves right from the time of World War II. The document &amp;quot;State technical standard for excavations and maintenance of mass graves in war conditions&amp;quot; was adopted in September last year and entered into force on February 1, 2022.

&gt; &amp;quot;Finally, the political scientist notes that&amp;quot;On February 26, 4 days after the planned attack and 2 days after the real attack, the largest Russian state portal RIA Novosti published an article about the victory over Ukraine and the final solution of the Ukrainian issue.
