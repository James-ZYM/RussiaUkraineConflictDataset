[],False,,scientist_salarian1,,,[],,,,text,t2_9dies,False,False,"&gt;Because in the current game of geopolitics, India has nothing to gain in the long term by siding with Russia, unless it has (frankly, unrealistic) hopes of topping China's influence within the Kremlin.

There's a lot of assumptions here. India is not necessarily siding with Russia. It wants to be in relatively good standing with both. Their hand is currently being forced as the West is presenting this current situation as either you're with them or against them. 

India absolutely wants the West's assistance against China but is wary of the West as their relations have historically been cool to lukewarm at best. India's relations with Russia/USSR have always been warmer. 

In the long term, if India decides to alienate Russia, it can potentially find itself surrounded by two hostile nuclear powers (Russia and China), both of which have a large footprint on Central/South Asia. The West can promise all it wants to India, but they're an ocean and a continent away from India and can drop the latter like a hot potato when it suits them. 

India has immediate security concerns. It doesn't need to replace China as the Kremlin's bff. It only needs to be in good enough terms with Russia so that Russia wouldn't assist China when or if the two clash. In fact, India has been buying Russian arms for a while now despite frosty relations with the Chinese.",881b702911391769efd31a153968c1f76782a855,True,False,,,,,0,1649203067,,0,{},i3k6btx,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t1_i3jufei,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3k6btx/,1649203078,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649174267.0,

This really has nothing to do with Russian oil, and everything to do with the fact that 70% of India's military is Russian hardware.

&gt;	But I am very concerned about the overwhelming economic predominance of China over the next decade. People like me have been saying precisely [that] we have to solve the Ukraine problem, we have to solve the Nato problem, so that we can be in a strong position vis-à-vis China. Now it will be much more difficult for Russia to resist Chinese power.

So the bigger existential threat to Russia lies with China, so they picked this fight with Ukraine/NATO first.

Firstly, Europe's main issue isn't spending, but the fact that European defence is split among many small states, with plenty of redundancies in command, force composition and equipment procurement. It's incredibly inefficient. Furthermore without any centralised authority to command it all, the European allied forces would be uncoordinated without the stronger US army at the centre with the American Supreme Allied Commander taking the lead.

Defence spending in this a red herring which distracts from the structural and political problems which would be far more controversial to address.

Given US opposition to previous attempts at increasing spending through intra-European projects, it also comes off as a way to feed the American military-industrial complex, rather than making Europe capable of self defense. It's ""spend more money on American goods"".

If America is serious about pulling out, it's going to have to trust Europeans and it's going to have to push them to go further with strategic autonomy and military integration.

As for Asia, most Americans are at least weary of China and Chinese influence. Domestic and foreign political goals align here. The US wants to bring industry back home, which means jobs for working-class people, and hurts China, but it also wants to contain China in its ways. The Pacific is of strategic interest to the US. That's not even mentioning the significance of Taiwan and TSMC in particular right now.

Foreign dominance of the Pacific at least in theory also threatens the US West Coast.

In the long term however, the US can only stay out of Eurasia so long as no single country consolidates too much power there. Eurasia is significantly more population and resource rich than the Americas, and therefore America must not only be a sea power, but prevent any country from consolidating too much power in Eurasia. If US fears China might do this, which is not unrealistic, it has no choice but to contain China.

China has a good shot at controlling the Heartland, and who controls the Heartland controls the World-Island. Who rules the World-island commands the world. At least such goes Mackinder's thesis, which has never quite been tested, as no power has quite managed to consolidate the Heartland to the necessary extent with the necessary resources thus far.

Of course that has been intentional, as Britain, and the US especially have done what they can to contain any power which might do so.

Human history and particularly human interaction is drenched in blood. But, as an optimist I think it's overly shallow to just view history as endless conflict. 

Today we live, as a global average, better than ever before. Exploitative systems exist and will likely continue to exist for centuries or millennia to come, but they've bent towards a positive history for humanity long term. Reading trends out of history is frowned upon (for good reason), but I believe we have been moving towards a more just world over time for ages now. 

It's a bit naive, I think, to dream of a perfect world within our lifetimes. Assuming we don't somehow cure death, the best we can do is leave a better world behind us than we started with. The economic exploitation that occurs today is smaller in scale and more frowned upon today than it was 50 years ago and 50 years ago was a more just society than in Victorian times. 

Human progress is built on each of us laying a single brick, building a bridge to a better future we may never see. People advocated against absolute monarchy and against slavery for centuries before they were defeated. 

So yes, those of us in rich countries profit from an unjust economic system (open question what a just economic system will look like), but even small steps lead to a brighter future. Things as small as my country's Lieferkettengesetz (supply chain law) that tries to hold companies accountable for human rights violations in their supply chains are imperfect watered down improvements on the status quo. 

So short term? Yeah we're not gonna make the world a utopia, but by advocating for small steps that have broad acceptance in society, we can inch closer to a better world. Most people aren't against watching for human rights abuses in supply chains, but most would reject a radical change in living standards for some abstract morality. Change is not about the big flashy memorable moments, but about inching towards a better future. Setbacks will occur, but today we live in a better world than ever before. It isn't perfect, but we can strive to make invisible slight improvements to the world that leave it better than we found it. 

Rome wasn't built in a day, it was built by countless generations working towards a goal they would never see themselves. In the short term there will always be problems in need of solving, but long term we inch towards a better future.

I think Asia will take the lead in the next century. 

But if I must guess there are 3 options for flourishing African nations. 

South Africa, Rwanda and Tunisia

South Africa until now is the most developed country in Africa. The problem I have with south Africa though is that there still is huge inequality between different areas. Obviously every country has some inequality, different provinces have extreme differences between GDP per capita. 

Rwanda is being called the Singapore of Africa I have learned from geography go. Apperantly countries want to settle in Rwanda because of better tax opportunity and stability. I don't really know what tye deal is with Rwanda but apperantly it is already beginning to take the position of a developed country.

My third guess is Tunisia. This is purely based on geography. Tunisia has some of the best HDI and GDP per capita rates in Africa. Besides that Tunisia is a lot smaller than other countries in Africa. Countries like Libya and Algeria have big populations but they have too much ""uncontrollable"" territory in the form of desert. Instability and uncontrollability are a breeding habit for rebellion. Tunisia doesn't have the same risk for that as it is pretty centralised. And don't forget the great placing it has. In the middle of the Mediterranean near Italy with great diplomatic relations to the whole of Europe. 

South Africa at the moment is the leader of Africa, but but endures massive inequality. Rwanda is developing, but I see problems when it comes to recourses.

What you're suggesting is literally the opposite of what any long term thinker who understands investing would do.

You invest the most in the young, and throughout their long lives they will work better the more you invest in them and generate greater and greater returns.

Taking money from the young to pay for the old, is the exact opposite, you are limiting the potentials of the young and hence their future productivity, to pay for the elderly to generate pretty much non-existent returns, effectively killing off longer term returns.

In the former scenario, due to being invested in, the young will have all their lives to earn well and plan for when they become old.
In the latter scenario, due to not being invested in, the young won't earn as much, live worse lives, and be forced to depend on 'help' to survive since they will have been struggling to get by due to not being allowed a serious chance at life - which will be fine for the ones aging early, but the ones aging later won't get the help because the returns have collapsed by then.

nato missions in the middle east:  
international security mission in afghanistan (with every un security counsil country voting for it and plenty of non nato members taking part)

as well as the followup mission (again, unanimously voted for it by the security council)

border defense for turky

pakistan earth quake relive

anti-piracy at somalia (with, again, plenty of non nato countrys like india, russia, japan, china etc. taking part)

no-fly zone over lybia as imposed by the united nations (adopted with votes by china, india, russia, brasil, and more)

and.. thats pretty much it.

so we are talking either about un missions, border defense or humanitarian aid. no ""delivering democracy"". thsoe where american missions, not nato.  


&gt;Plus it does not matter who invented slavery, it is who used it. 

every country in the world used it until the west decided that it was not humanitarian and forced the world to abandon slavery... or at least practice it less openly (like quite a few country's in the middle east do)

&gt;The whole EU is shouting now because war is at their border, 

imagine that, a war at your border, the likes not seen in method or goal since the utter destruction wrought by the second world war, does concern people more then one far away. who would've fought?

&gt;and the people migrating/ getting killed are white, blue-eyed people (as being told in western media),

that can only come from someone ignorant of the utter havoc hitler wrought upon the ukrainians for being 'subhumans'. with hitler and stalin, ukraine lost nearly 15 million people, or round about 1/3 of its population between 1932 and 1945.

just to put that in to perspective. the nazis saw them as less as africans. 

and even jsut a few years back, slavs suffered great prejudice in western europa. probably more then asians.

so that accusation is at best ignorant. at best.

&gt; else if it had been in the middle east or somewhere in Asia, you would have remained quite, like always.

if someone burns down a house in the next city over its a bid different then burning down the house of your neighbor... 

not to mention that such things as ""nuclear annihilation of the human race"", ""chernobyl"" and ""russian imperialistic ambition in europa"" might help fuel some fears.

but despite that, i'm pretty sure that europa is a lot more vocal about wars world wide then countrys like, say... india, brasil, chine or any country in the middle east.

&gt;And yes, directly or indirectly whole west owns to my country because not all of the wealth looted stayed at Britain, it was distributed/used to develop the West.

First off, and this is the fault of the article's author who just butchered this, the Sec. 301 tariffs on China were not lifted.  Rather, what actually happened was that a select number of products that had already been approved for exclusion from the tariffs were given an extension of that exclusion.  When the tariff codes for the corresponding products were given exemption through notice in the federal register, that exemption was only valid for one year from that time.  In fact, these exemptions had already been extended once before, back at the end of 2020 before Trump left office.

So what really happened here is that tariff exclusions that were granted under the Trump administration and Sec. Lighthizer and then in fact already extended once under the Trump administration have now been extended again.  No new harmonized tariff codes were considered for exclusion and the tariffs aren't lifted.

I think that geopolitics doesn't explain the West's annoyance with India very well because it's moral in nature. Westerners are watching Ukrainians getting massacred and are stirred to action. Furthermore, unlike many recent wars, the aggressor is very well-defined. This is not a civil war of masked insurgents, this is a war between uniformed militaries caused by aggressive invasion. Neutrality feels like tacit approval of such acts, and so some portion of the anger at Russia is drawn to neutral parties like India, Saudi Arabia, and China (who are sorta kinda Russian allies). The West is done with giving Russia any kind of credibility in the broader world, and that means isolating it as much as possible.

Now, I think it should be noted that the outrage is populace-driven rather than leadership driven. I think western leaders are perfectly fine with India being at least mostly neutral. I think 99% of the complaining has come from people on social media, which forces the government to say and do things, but I don't think any serious confrontation between India and the West is looming.

Well, what he should have said, this is the price they have to pay us. That’s how the stock market took it. When he said this is the price we have to pay, this is the price consumers have to pay to the American oil companies, to the American Agricultural food distribution companies. It’s the price other countries have to pay to the United States.

This is to say to the rest of the world, you know, we’ve got you completely, I don’t know how to put it, what phrase to use, but you don’t have any choice, your money or your life. We’ve got you trapped. And he’s crowing over the fact that this resulting inflation is exactly what was intended by the war in Ukraine that has led to the isolation of Russia and other countries following a non-US policy.

-But more and more countries in Latin America, in Africa, are turning to countries like China for partnerships, for investment. Do you see a point coming where there is just this real shunning of the United States and turning to these alternatives?

That is exactly what’s going to happen. What’s going to happen is, China’s investment is very different from US investment. US and European investment will give financial investments to countries at interest that the whole country is liable for to repay. China’s investment is taking place by means of the Belt and Road Initiative and direct capital investment in developing ports, infrastructure and railways. And instead of having a general financial claim against these countries, China has an equity claim, a property claim backed by the physical means of production that it puts in place.

Well, this summer, when countries say they cannot afford to pay their foreign debts, the United States has as a backup plan, okay, let’s write down everybody’s debts, government debts, to each other so that governments can pay the private bond holders and the banks. And they’re going to try to, essentially the US will forgive its debts so that Latin America can pay Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank and the bondholders. And China is going to say, wait a minute, we don’t have any financial claim against these countries. We didn’t lend them dollars. We didn’t lend them our foreign currency at all. We built assets there and the assets are still in place. There’s no problem there.

So, the question is, whose debts are going to be written down to whom? And all of this is going to lead to, as you can imagine, destabilization. The United States is probably going to try to push regime change on countries that try to trade with China as it’s already threatened China with. And the more sanctions the United States imposes on Latin America, Africa and the Near East and South Asia, they will be creating a crisis, but the crisis will lead the rest of the world to treat the United States in the same way that Russia and China are treating the United States as just the enemy threatening the entire world with their neoliberal power grab. So, the United States in a way is isolating itself from the rest of the world by declaring war on it.

-And I think that’s not going to be good for us here at home in the United States. We’ve talked about the way that the current economy has been structured. We’ve also raised a lot of concern about the climate crisis. And of course, we have the recent IPCC report basically saying that we’re way behind in taking action to even adapt to the climate crisis or the warming that we’re going to be experiencing. So now in this new situation, how do we see that impacting the climate crisis?

Here’s what Biden said, in effect: “We’re way behind in the pace of global warming.” American policy is based on increasing and accelerating global warming. That has been a central point of US policy ever since I’ve known the Hudson Institute in the 1970s. The United States is opposing any attempt at trying to prevent global warming because you can imagine what would happen if other countries go to solar energy and renewable energy. That will reduce their dependency on the US oil industry. If you look at American policy, it is being run basically by the oil industry to establish dependence of other countries on oil. Then obviously the last thing the United States is ever going to do is prevent global warming. So, if we’re behind in global warming, it’s that the sea level is not rising fast enough. The world is not getting hot fast enough not to lock in foreign reliance on America’s oil.

And I think you’ve seen what in the last few weeks, what President Biden has said, the fuel of the future is coal and oil. He was in Poland. I think he’s suggesting that Polish coal, which is one of its major products, should be used in Europe instead of Russian gas. So, American foreign policy is based on the accelerated use of coal and oil, not renewable energy.

Now, that’s why I think the environmental movement should become an anti-war movement and the movement against this neoliberal dollar hegemony. You’re not going to avoid global warming unless you stop the dominance of American foreign policy by the oil industry.",fd37bd27002519676047cbbf9abd0bd5501825d5,True,False,,,,,0,1649181841,,0,{},i3iph2z,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t1_i3ip76l,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3iph2z/,1649181857,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649153041.0,

The United States removed Russia from the SWIFT system, which is the international mechanism for doing trading and finance. It threatened China if they didn’t denounce what was happening with Russia and Ukraine to kick them out of the SWIFT system. So, this hubris of the United States is also kind of driving countries away to seek other alternatives, right?

That’s the whole point. Well, fortunately they’ve been threatening to kick Russia out of SWIFT for the last two years. And so, Russia and China have been putting in place an alternative system. So, they almost pretty smoothly are shifting over to using their own currency with each other instead of using the dollar. And that’s part of what has ended the dollar standard and ended dollar hegemony.

If the way you have dollar hegemony is to have other countries deposit your money in your banks and handle their oil trade with each other by financing it in dollars, but all of a sudden you grab all their dollars and you don’t let them use US banks to pay for their oil and their trade with each other, then they’re going to shift to a different system. And that’s exactly what has ended the dollar hegemony. 

-So, let’s get a little bit into where things are headed with this new situation, a rapidly changing situation. It may be hard to say what’s happening, but let’s talk about the upcoming food crisis this summer. How does the conflict in Ukraine feed into that?

Well, as Putin and Lavrov have said, the fighting in Ukraine isn’t really over Ukraine at all. It’s a fight over what shape the world will take and whether the world will be unipolar or, as it now appears, multipolar. The US, for the last year before it began to escalate attacks on the Russian-speaking Ukraine, was trying to block Europe from, and especially Germany, from buying Russia gas and oil.

There are three pillars of American foreign policy that base American power. The first pillar is the oil industry. That’s the most powerful industry next to banking in the United States. And United States throughout the 20th century, along with Britain and France, have controlled the world oil trade.

That has benefited the United States in two ways. Number one, we are a major oil exporter because we have a big oil and gas industry. But, number two, our US companies control the foreign oil trade. So that if some country, say Chile or Venezuela, does something that the United States doesn’t like, like growing their own food or pursuing a socialist policy, the United States can simply cut off their oil and sanction them. Without oil, they don’t have energy to drive the cars or power their factories or drive their GDP.

So, the American war in Ukraine is really a war against Germany. Russia is not the enemy. Germany and Europe are the enemy and the United States made it very clear. This is a war to lock in our allies so they cannot trade with Russia. They cannot buy Russian oil. They must be dependent on American oil for which they will have to pay three or four times as much. They will have to be dependent on American liquefied natural gas for fertilizer. If they don’t buy American gas for fertilizer, and we don’t let them buy from Russia, then they cannot put fertilizer on the land and the crop yield will fall by about 50% without fertilizer.

So, the, the war in Ukraine was to make Russia look so bad by defending itself against the attacks by the Ukrainian right wing in the Russian-speaking areas that the US has said, look at how bad Russia is. You’ve got to forego buying oil and gas or grain or titanium or palladium or anything else from Russia.

And so, the effect of this war has been to lock the NATO countries into dependency on the United States because the great fear of the United States in the last few years is that as America is de-industrializing, these countries are looking to the part of the world that’s growing, China, Central Asia, Russia, South Asia. And the United States feared losing control of its satellites mainly in NATO, but also in South America. So, it sanctioned and blocked their ability to buy non-US energy. They’re blocking their ability to buy non-US food, blocking their ability to invest in or use their surplus to get prosperous by investing in China, Russia, or Eurasia.

So, this is basically a war of America to lock in its allies. Well, the result is that oil prices, now that you can’t get Russian oil, are going to go way, way up, and that is going to create a crisis for many of the Global South countries that are oil deficit countries. The fertilizer companies in Germany have already been closing down because they say, without Russian gas, we make our fertilizer out of gas, and if we can’t get Russian gas, we can’t produce the fertilizer that. So, world fertilizer prices are going way up.

Russia is the largest grain exporter. And now that grain exports are being blocked by the sanctions, the question is, what are North Africa and the Near East going to do that have been depending very largely on Russian grain exports? Their food prices are going to go way up.

You can imagine just from seeing what’s happening in the United States when gas prices go up here, food prices go up here, not only does it put a squeeze on individual family budgets, but throughout the world, it puts the squeeze on the balance of payments of other countries. And so, they’re desperate. How are they going to pay the higher prices unless they borrow even more money from US banks? And of course, that’s another arm of US policy. The US banks hope to make a killing in making loans at rising interest rates to third world countries.

And of course, arms exports. NATO in the last few days has agreed to make American arms exports to increase their purchase of arms. So, the stock market has been soaring in the last few days. They say this, the world famine, the world crisis is a bonanza for Wall Street. The oil company stocks are going way up, the military, industrial stocks, Boeing Raytheon way up, the bank stocks. This is America’s great power grab, and it realizes, when it can create a crisis and tell the Global South or poor countries your money or your life. This is how most of the great property grabs and conquests have been made throughout history.",7173aca4539672a5d2f5360cc76886756ee1d672,True,False,,,,,0,1649181713,,0,{},i3ip76l,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t1_i3ip1ng,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3ip76l/,1649181731,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649152913.0,

[],False,,JettWoo,,,[],,,,text,t2_1nj4zr7u,False,False,"-The de-dollarization has been happening relatively quickly in recent years. So, are we now we’re now just seeing the end result of that? I mean, people said it could happen quickly. Is that exactly what we’re seeing right now?

Yes, and nobody expected that it would happen this quickly. Nobody expected that it would be the United States itself that ends de-dollarization.

Most had expected that maybe China, Russia, and other countries would say, “We don’t want to give America free rides.” And yet it was the United States itself that broke all of this, by grabbing Russia’s reserves right after it grabbed Afghanistan’s and Venezuela’s reserves.

Nothing like this has happened in modern history, even in the 19th century wars. In the Crimean War in the mid-19th century, Russia, England and Germany, everybody kept paying the debts to the countries they were fighting against because the idea is that debts were sacrosanct. And now, all of a sudden, not only are debts are not sacrosanct, but countries can just grab foreign savings. I guess the problem began after the Shah of Iran fell and the United States grabbed Iran’s money and refused to let it pay its bond holders and started the whole war against Iran for trying to take control of its own oil resources. So, all of a sudden, the United States grabbing this has ended what everybody thought was an immutable morality.

-So that was in 1979 that the Shah fell in Iran and, and over the last number of decades, the United States has been increasingly using economic warfare against countries through what people call sanctions, but they’re actually, illegal unilateral coercive measures, has that been kind of driving and setting the stage for what is happening today?

Yes, the International Monetary Fund has operated, basically, as an arm of the Defense Department. It’s been bailing out dictatorships, bailing out Ukraine, lending money to countries whose client oligarchies America wants to support, and not lending any money to countries that America doesn’t want to support, like Venezuela. So, its job is basically to promote neoliberal policies, and to insist that other countries balance their payments by undergoing a class war against labor.

The conditionality that the IMF insists upon for foreign borrowing is that countries devalue their currency and lower their wage rates and pass anti-labor legislation. Well, when you lower the currency’s exchange rate, what do you really lower? Food prices are set in dollars internationally, raw materials prices are, and prices for machinery and many goods. The only economic variable devalued is domestic labor (and domestic rents). The IMF has been using this kind of junk-economic free-trade policy as a means of keeping the wage rates in the Global South down. You could say it’s a financialization of an ultimately military conflict to promote neoliberal ideology.

The lowering wages and things like that. And this is actually done because it’s favorable to US investors and US business, right? I mean, the World Bank actually has an index, the cost of doing business index, that helps inform large corporations about laws that countries pass that make them more favorable to businesses to come in.

It’s actually even worse than that. The central aim of the World Bank is to prevent other countries from growing their own food. That is the prime directive. It will only make loans for countries to earn foreign currency and it has insisted ever since about 1950 that countries that borrow from it must shift their agriculture to plantation export crops to grow tropical crops that cannot be grown in the United States for environmental and weather reasons. And the countries must not grow their own food and must not undertake Land Reform or small family-based farming. So, it insisted on foreign-owned agribusiness in large plantation agriculture. And what that means is that countries that have borrowed for agricultural loans have not been loans to produce their own food. It’s been to compete with each other producing tropical export crops while being increasingly dependent on the United States for their food supplies, and for their grain. And that’s part of the corner they painted them into that is going to be creating such a world famine this summer.",f62a19f97836c253ceb71e3ca2d44cec80af8b49,True,False,,,,,0,1649181637,,0,{},i3ip1ng,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t1_i3iopnh,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3ip1ng/,1649181656,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649152837.0,

[],False,,JettWoo,,,[],,,,text,t2_1nj4zr7u,False,False,"De-dollarization is real 


-Let’s start out by explaining what dollar hegemony is and how it has benefited the wealthy class in the United States?

Dollar hegemony seems to be the position that has just ended very abruptly. Dollar hegemony was when America’s war in Vietnam and the military spending of the 1960s and 70s drove the United States off gold. The entire US balance of payments deficit was military spending, and it began to run down the gold supply. So, in 1971, President Nixon took the dollar off gold. Well, everybody thought America has been controlling the world economy since World War I by having most of the gold and by being the creditor to the world. And they thought what is going to happen now that the United States is running a deficit, instead of being a creditor.

Well, what happened was that, when the United States went off gold, foreign central banks didn’t have anything to buy with their dollars that were flowing into their countries – again, mainly from the US military deficit but also from the investment takeovers. And they found that these dollars came in, the only thing they could do would be to recycle them to the United States. And what do central banks hold? They don’t buy property, usually, back then they didn’t. They buy Treasury bonds. And so, the United States would be spending dollars abroad and foreign central banks didn’t really have anything to do but send it right back to buy treasury bonds to finance not only the balance of payments deficit, but also the budget deficit that was largely military in character. So, dollar hegemony was the system where foreign central banks keep their monetary and international savings reserves in dollars and the dollars are used to finance the military bases around the world, almost eight hundred military bases surrounding them. So, basically central banks have to keep their savings by weaponizing them, by militarizing them, by lending them to the United States, to keep spending abroad.

This gave America a free ride. Imagine if you went to the grocery store and you just paid by giving them an IOU. And then the next week you want to buy more groceries and you give them another IOU. And they say, wait a minute, you have an IOU before and you say, well just use the IOU to pay the milk company that delivers, or the farmers that deliver. You can use this as your money and just you’ll as a customer, keep writing IOU’s and you never have to pay anything because your IOU is other people’s money. Well, that’s what dollar hegemony was, and it was a free ride. And it all ended when the United States grabbed Russia’s reserves having grabbed Afghanistan’s foreign reserves and Venezuela’s foreign reserves and those of other countries.

And all of a sudden, this means that other countries can no longer safely hold their reserves by sending their money back, depositing them in US banks or buying US Treasury Securities, or having other US investments because they could simply be grabbed as happened to Russia. So, all of a sudden, you’re seeing the world economy fracture into two parts, a dollarized part and other countries that do not follow the neoliberal policies that the United States insists that its allies follow. We’re seeing the birth of a new dual World economy.

-So, are we seeing then other countries starting to disinvest in US dollars? The treasury bonds that these central banks buy up have been basically funding our domestic economy. Are they starting to shed those bonds or what’s happening?

No, they haven’t been funding our domestic economy because the Federal Reserve can create its own money to fund the domestic economy. We don’t need to borrow from foreign countries to fund our economy. We can print it ourselves. What the dollar hegemony does is fund the balance of payments deficit. It funds our spending in other economies, our spending abroad. It doesn’t help our economy, but it does help us get a free ride from other countries. The more dollars we spend in making a military base, all these military expenditures get turned over to the local Central Bank that turns and sends them back to the Federal Reserve or deposits them in US bank accounts. So, it’s the international free ride we get, not a domestic free ride.

-Okay. So are we seeing countries now, starting to move their assets back to repatriate them because for Afghanistan, a big problem is that most of the government’s money was outside of the country and that has been used as a weapon against Afghanistan by seizing those assets and not allowing the Central Bank of Afghanistan to have them. Are we starting to see other countries repatriating their money and gold?

Well, figures are only available at the end of each month, reported at the end of each month and then there’s a two-month delay, so we don’t have any idea what’s happening. But the consensus is that everybody is now deciding the only place, certainly if you’re China or Russia or Kazakhstan or you’re in the Eurasian orbit, South Asia, East Asia, you realize, wait a minute, if all we have to do is something like Allende did in Chile or all we have to do is refuse to sell off our industry to American investors and they can treat us like they’ve treated Venezuela. So you can imagine that everybody’s watching this and there’s an expectation that as a result of the war in Ukraine, that’s really America’s NATO war, that this is going to create a balance-of-payments crisis throughout the whole Global South as their energy prices go up, oil prices soar, food prices are going to soar and this is going to make it impossible for them to pay their foreign debts unless they go without food and energy. Obviously, this is a political crisis. That is, the only result can be to split the world in two.",18deb58aa9136e9f550d959b4ac019b765a209b7,True,False,,,,,0,1649181476,,0,{},i3iopnh,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t1_i3ie4bl,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3iopnh/,1649181496,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649152676.0,

South Africa until now is the most developed country in Africa. The problem I have with south Africa though is that there still is huge inequality between different areas. Obviously every country has some inequality, different provinces have extreme differences between GDP per capita. 

Rwanda is being called the Singapore of Africa I have learned from geography go. Apperantly countries want to settle in Rwanda because of better tax opportunity and stability. I don't really know what tye deal is with Rwanda but apperantly it is already beginning to take the position of a developed country.

My third guess is Tunisia. This is purely based on geography. Tunisia has some of the best HDI and GDP per capita rates in Africa. Besides that Tunisia is a lot smaller than other countries in Africa. Countries like Libya and Algeria have big populations but they have too much ""uncontrollable"" territory in the form of desert. Instability and uncontrollability are a breeding habit for rebellion. Tunisia doesn't have the same risk for that as it is pretty centralised. And don't forget the great placing it has. In the middle of the Mediterranean near Italy with great diplomatic relations to the whole of Europe. 

South Africa at the moment is the leader of Africa, but but endures massive inequality. Rwanda is developing, but I see problems when it comes to recourses. Rwanda would be completely dependent on foreign business.

Agreed.  India really needs to work on building up its indigenous arms industry.  They did well with their space launch industry and are very competitive there. So not sure why they can't do the same for weapons manufacturing locally.

The files revealing the scope of US involvement was only declassified in 2017, though it wasn't exactly news to anyone paying attention.  

Or what about the CIA's role in supporting the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile?  They dumped tons of money into opposition groups.  The coup was successful and Pinochet took power.  In 1975 the US Senate said this about what the CIA's money was used for:

&gt;  
It financed activities covering a broad spectrum, from simple propaganda manipulation of the press to large-scale support for Chilean political parties, from public opinion polls to *direct attempts to foment a military coup*.”

  What about the CIA's role in the overthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala on behalf of the United Fruit Company under operation PBSSUCCESS?  After overthrowing Arbenz, the country was put under a dictatorship that was much more friendly to American geopolitical goals.

You can look over the declassified files if you want primary sources for the details of US involvement in these.  And that is hardly the entirety of the United States' role in overthrowing democratically elected governments that went counter to US political/economic goals.

So when people frame things as ""Putin and China are against democracy whereas the US supports democracy"" its a bit questionable when we look at America's history.  I don't think someone has to be a paid Russian troll to consider these things.

Regardless of what the federal governments do, they still have local, county and state governments which are operating fairly normally. Based on history, I would say the turmoil was comparatively worse in the 60s and 70s during the race riots, pentagon papers, Vietnam and the OPEC embargo. The closest thing I can think of is 9/11 but that galvanized most Americans. The effects of the Iraq and Afghanistan war were not really felt at home like the way Vietnam was.

Besides, more local to me, China has sparked riots with their idiotic zero COVID policy around Shenzhen and Shanghai. Back to welding people into their homes or locking them up in giant warehouses with other sick people. It's clear that the sinovac vaccine is fairly ineffective against new variants. 

My overall point being while America has internal strife, China does as well. It's just very well hidden via media controls and propaganda, so it's hard to predict whose internal problems will cause a major collapse first. Second, it also depends on how they respond to it.

 My grandfather invest his money and time (also time, money and skills of relatives and friend) to clean, rebuild the ruins of the hospital and reform the hospital in a mansion (23 room + 4 bathrooms + 2 kitchens) he also spend money in build a car parking area from scratch and in clean the lands of the hospital in a garden (for what I listen he never finish the garden)

The Spanish democratic government took the land with a minimum compensation ( no enof for buy or build something similar or to bought a similar terrain attach to the property) to buil a highway (that was downgrade to a normal road).

&gt;but why does Saudi Arabia not get the same pressure?

They did, and the Saudis responded. [Saudi Arabia has increased their production, and has increased investment into future production](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/saudi-aramco-to-increase-oil-production-to-meet-global-demand).

&gt;Why can't NATO ask its partners to control oil prices?

The US is releasing record amounts of oil from its strategic reserve, Canada is increasing production to the extent that it can in the short term, and Norway is already producing at capacity, but outside of that NATO doesn't have a lot of oil.

Most of NATO is dependent on oil imports, and are, themselves, getting hammered by high oil prices. France, Germany, Poland, UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, etc: these aren't oil producing countries, they are oil consuming countries.

&gt;Why cant USA sell oil at a lower price to these nations if it wants their cooperation against Russia?

Why do people act like the US is some all powerful entity that can just snap its fingers or bribe the entire world?

First of all, the US doesn't control oil prices, and its cooperation with OPEC is a ""frienemies"" type of relationship. Just a couple of years ago, the Saudis and OPEC crashed oil prices in order to try to put American oil producers out of business and limit the supply increase coming from US shale, so they could maintain their own market share. If the US had the ability to control the oil market, it probably would have done so then.

Russia is the one who actively works with OPEC (in what is called OPEC+), not the US. A lot of the Middle Eastern OPEC members are much better described as Russian allies than American ones. Iran is far from an American ally, and is embargoed by the US. Venezuela is, too. If the US could make those countries fall in line, it would have happened years ago.

The US can influence the oil market, and is using all its levers to do so now, but it is far from having the ability to control the oil market. If it did, it would have controlled it for its own benefit years ago. It has made moves which have significantly lowered oil prices already, but it doesn't control that market.

As for the idea of ""bribe me and I'll help you out"", that doesn't work. Bribe India and dozens of other countries will ask for the same, not just now, but the next time, too. All of a sudden, the US' ability to impose sanctions is gone, because the cost of bribery (along with the santions themselves) exceeds the benefit of the sanctions. That's why the much easier approach is secondary sanctions, which is where this looks to be headed.

&gt;From my understanding they can buy oil from Iran either.

Indian can and has been.

&gt;Then why are NATO members attacking India when it is trying to protect itself from a similar energy crisis in India.

Because India is attacking NATO members by publicly allying with Russia and undermining NATO sanctions. 

Sanctions aren't free. Every country imposing sanctions absorbs a cost to their own economy from doing so. Countries traded with Russia for a reason, and cutting off that market is a cost, not only to Western countries, but to every one of the multi-national companies who pulled out of Russia, stranding all the assets and investments they had made there.

So, how can you remotely be surprised when countries doing that are mad at the nation who is undermining those sanctions by increasing trade with Russia and making headline-grabbing economic deals with them?

[India quadrupled its oil imports from Russia in March](https://www.ft.com/content/5efc6338-3f01-4015-aedf-53a4a1944ca8), giving Russian oil which had been stranded by sanctions a market. Now, [India goes an announces a deal to let Russia invest and borrow from its domestic market](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/india-to-allow-russia-to-invest-borrow-from-domestic-market-report-122033100253_1.html), which is another move which directly allows Russia to bypass sanctions.

India is actively siding with Russia and actively working to undermine Western sanctions, what planet do you live on where you don't think the West is going to be pissed at that?

The West isn't taking the hit to their economies to impose sanctions so that India can profit by snagging cheap oil.

Even worse, [the US Congress was already faced with a decision on sanctions on India for a previous Russian arms purchase.](https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/sanctioning-india-russian-arms-deal-would-be-counterproductive) Basically, after Crimea was annexed, the US imposed sanctions, and one law passed required the US to sanction countries purchasing S-400 systems from Russia. In defiance of this, India purchased those systems, requiring the US, by law, to impose sanctions on India. The US has been quietly delaying the decision, but these recent moves by India are basically daring the US to sanction them.

And, the strangest part, is that Indians on Reddit keep saying the ""its in our best interest"" line, but it's just not. The US is India's largest trading partner, and large European nations liter the top 10 list of Indian trading partners. You know who doesn't crack the top 10? Russia.

India is pissing off several of its largest trading partners and basically daring them to impose sanctions, in order to prop up a nation that is outside of their top 10 trading partners.

If the US does follow-through and impose the sanctions India is daring them to impose, no amount of cheap Russian oil will come close to making up for the economic consequences of sanctions.

I don't know why India seems to be self-destructive here, or why they parrot talking points from Russian-owned media companies like WION, but y'all have to tell your leaders to stop being idiots. The US has been trying to increase ties with India, who is now part of the QUAD, but you insist on actively undermining the US instead.

No one is asking you to sanction Russia, just for you to be neutral. Don't increase your trade with Russia, but don't decrease it either. But, for a war that is currently being fought with economics, making headlines by entering into trade deals that undermine Western sactions, is not neutrality, it is siding with Russia. If that's the side you want to be on, then that's your choice, but certainly don't be surprised when the West criticizes you, and don't be surprised when Western investment dries up, the West walks away from trade cooperation or when India actually gets hit with sanctions. That's the path you guys are choosing.",387b17c488d1ac84afbfb4402215eb59777140a3,True,False,,,,,0,1649171399,,0,{},i3hz4s4,False,t3_twlpg3,False,True,t3_twlpg3,/r/geopolitics/comments/twlpg3/why_is_india_getting_pressured_by_nato_members/i3hz4s4/,1649171412,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649142599.0,

Well that is the whole crux of the argument.  

&gt;So if your grandfather was alive would you not support his claim for the land he was evicted from for example in 1978?

Selfishly, for that kind of money, sure I would.  Would I want that to be national policy from an unbiased perspective?  No.

Ask me if I would support almost ANY claim of my grandfather if it would give me $10,000,000 worth of land and I'll probably say yes.  But then again, I'd probably take $10,000,000 from the government with no strings attached regardless of whether I believed in the morality of the situation.

That's why we have laws though, from an unbiased perspective.  Sure, I can always understand why people want money by any means they can get it.  

Regardless... in South Africa the government can take land if it provides compensation.  That's in the constitution.

They kept their currency artificially low to export more to the US at cheaper prices, making their exports more competitive. The US objectively benefitted. If anyone complains, it should be other manufacturing/exporting countries. 

""massive govt backed industrial espionage and hacking, turning a blind eye to manufacturers ripping US tech""

US multinational corps, the most ruthless mercantile institutions the world has ever seen, were the helpless victims of Chinese corporate espionage? Give me a break. These corporations made an absolute killing and became multi-trillion dollar powerhouses as a result. The corps played the short game, the Chinese played the long game. 

""invasion and annexation of Tibet""

Yep. US didn't have a problem with it when China was weak and US corporations were making a killing.

""violation of agreements with Hong Kong""

True. But from the Chinese perspective, the British illegally carved Hong Kong out of China so retaking Hong Kong was a way for the now-great-again power China to shake off the effects of what they say as humiliating colonialism. I don't think the Chinese will honor any agreements made in the colonial era. 

""genocide of Uighers not much different than what Russia is doing to Ukraine.""

Well, it is. First of all, it's not a war. Also, there's really not any proof that a genocide is happening. China is forcibly detaining Uyghurs and splitting the community so it cannot pose a threat to the CCP, but that is not genocide. 

Also, Ukraine war isn't a genocide.

One, the highest-income economies are diversified economies with a large educated workforce and limited dependence on resource extraction (for exports). People have brought up Congo and Nigeria, but these countries rely a good deal on resource extraction. This is risky, not only because it risks the Dutch Disease of sucking up most investment in a few industries, but also because resource extraction often leads to massive inequality and corruption as the leaders of that industry will control most wealth, and there can be fierce and often armed conflict over who gets to control it. The Resource Curse is a threat.

And what you say is true to a certain extent( regarding human rights and personal freedoms ) , but except Saudi and Bahrain ( surprisingly really very authoritarian ) which are probably more authoritarian than China  , the other gulf countries are actually not as authoritarian as China. Democracy Index actually ranks Kuwait and Qatar above China tbf. Also youtube and other Western social media are also not banned in any of these Gulf countries. 

In countries like UAE and Qatar we are only shown the migrant part of them in our newspapers and we come to conclusion that every single Indian and Pakistani are migrant workers. 

But this isn't actually the case ( the migrant population is still there though,  and don't get me wrong I am definitely not absolving them completely. I am just saying that situation isn't as bad as we really think ) . There is a decent middle class local population ( that is Emirati, Qatari or whatever) and  decently prosperous expat community too in  UAE and Qatar who are South Asians . You have a variety of Indian schools too in these  countries with typical middle class admission fee and complete admissions.

In UAE alone you have like 30 Indian schools . Also a variety of private hospitals owned by Indians are also present in UAE and Qatar( I am saying this from my experience of being treated in Qatar for a heat stroke, in a hospital I think named 'Aster' which actually had a complete Indian management) . While there are Indian migrant workers in both countries. There is also a massive population of Indian teachers( school , music, sports etc.) , doctors , engineers, general managers in steel, gratings and oil-gas companies, Indian restaurent owners ( Dubai especially is insane when it comes to Indian restaurants) etc.  .

So while human rights and personal freedoms aren't great the QOL is pretty good in both these countries. Also death penalty isn't that strict in UAE or Qatar compared to Saudi. ( In Saudi they execute 100 people per year while in UAE it's like 2 in 3 years and Qatar didn't even execute anyone from 2003 to 2020 for 17 years , with 2020 finally breaking that streak  ) . Believe me the homeless the population here in Gulf is probably less than even the US .

But one big problem all of them share is the heat. This is something you will never face in the Western World . The unbearable heat here will definitely be a pain the first month( I mentioned I got a heat stroke even right in my answer). Qatar, Kuwait especially have terrifying heat.

Nigeria is a country which is 
- Purely oil based, extremely low on economic 
complexity index, oil is almost the entire ty of exports, since oil proces crash almost no per capita GDP ppp growth for 8 years and counting! 
- Largest amount of extremely poor people in the world (yes, more than India), according to some research poverty is increasing (see above, economic stagnation) 
- Of course typical resource course case where small elite group benefits from oil without benefiting rest of the country
- Imports food and resources it can domestically produce, buying them for oil, while decades ago it was agricultural exporter
- GDP PPP per capita looks good on paper, and then you see any sort of health indicators 
or quality of life things and you see Nigeria on the very bottom of world comparisions
- Demographic explosion, overpopulated, among the highest fertility and lowest contraceprives rate in the world
- Utterly destroyed forest cover, massive desertification, temperature growth rate faster than world average, Sahara and Sahel moving south, driving millions of cattle herders south to wars with farmers
- Spent last 60 years forever brutally torn between Christian southern half (previously pagan civilizations for 1000 years) and Muslim Sharia law north (previously Muslim civilizations for 1000 years), the divide continues to this day and is getting worse
- To make matters worse northern half is devastatingly poorer than south (it is on Niger 
levels of HDI) 
- On top of that it is divided between several very big and powerful nations which all have their own separatism which are increasing nowadays (remember it already had Biafran genocide) 
- Has literały like 7 separate military conflicts ongoing in the same time, killing thousands per year
- Including bandit wars, because the government barely controls security 
- Among worst crime rates in the world too
- Corruption very bad even for African standards
- Boko Haram conflict government is incapable to end for over a decade
- Very volatile neighbors as well, with all sorts of conflicts going back and forth between borders
- Highly dysfunctional political regime based around north - south divide and nationalisms (which isn't surprising when you have  multiple, old, huge, very alien to each other civilizations lumped into a single country) 
- 11th or 12th on the Fragile States Index

Any more questions? 

There are countries in Africa which have very nice prospects for development, such as Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania - but Nigeria is not one of them. 

I will also brutally honestly say, that after reading its history it seems to me like most of problems of Nigeria seem to all go back to the aforementioned issue of a single country which artifically includes its equivalents of Poland, Turkey and Russia.

We’re fighting for our right to live, to exist, and should we win today the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice,

[],False,,Thalesian,,,[],,,,text,t2_9a2zp,False,False,"Submission Statement:

On April 4, 2022 Ria Novosti published an article featuring eliminationalist rhetoric (borrowing from [Goldhagen’s 2009](https://www.amazon.com/Worse-Than-War-Genocide-Eliminationism/dp/1586487698/ref=nodl_) nomenclature) against the Ukrainians. The attached link is an English translation with a link to the Russian original. Three sequential parts of the argument offered in the article stick out, the first being the definition of what “Nazi” means in the Ukrainian context: 

&gt; The current nazified Ukraine is characterized by its formlessness and ambivalence, which allow it to disguise Nazism as the aspiration to “independence” and the “European” (Western, pro-American) path of “development” (in reality, to degradation) and claim that “there is no Nazism” in Ukraine, “only few sporadic incidents.” Indeed, there isn’t a main Nazi party, no Führer, no full-fledged racial laws (only a cutdown version in the form of repressions against the Russian language). As a result — no opposition or resistance against the regime.

The next step in the argument is arguing specifically for eliminating an independent Ukrainian ethnic (not just national) identity: 

&gt; Denazification will inevitably include de-ukrainization — the rejection of the large-scale artificial inflation of the ethnic component in the self-identification of the population of the historical Malorossiya and Novorossiya territories, which was started by the Soviet authorities… Ukrainism is an artificial anti-Russian construct that has no civilizational substance of its own, a subordinate element of an extraneous and alien civilization. Debanderization alone will not be enough for denazification: the Banderite element is only a hand and a screen, a disguise for the European project of the Nazi Ukraine, which is why the denazification of Ukraine means its inevitable de-europeanization.

And lastly, “denazification” defined as largely an elimination of those western-oriented Ukrainians not just in wartime: 

&gt; Denazification as a goal of the special military operation within the limits of the operation itself means a military victory over the Kyiv regime, the liberation of the territories from the armed supporters of nazification, the elimination of hard-line Nazis, the imprisonment of war criminals, and the creating of systemic conditions for further denazification in peacetime.

Taken in the context of the [Bucha massacre](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/eu-leaders-condemn-killing-of-unarmed-civilians-in-bucha-and-kyiv), this would suggest Russia is adopting a similar approach to Ukraine as it has taken in the past with [Poland](https://warsawinstitute.review/issue-2020/the-katyn-massacre-mechanisms-of-genocide/), [Belarus](https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/fr/document/kurapaty-1937-1941-nkvd-mass-killings-soviet-belarus.html), [Baltics](https://gulag.online/articles/soviet-repression-and-deportations-in-the-baltic-states?locale=en) and others. The questions that arise from this posture: 

1) To what other countries would this posture apply to? Would Slovakia, for example, require similar denazificaiton under the definitions provided by Russian state media?
2) How does targeted killings of pro-European integration members of states like Ukraine position Russian and European relations moving forward? 
3) Are there effective countermeasures that European nations should consider? And lastly,
4) What must change about post-cold war diplomatic relationships in the context of a major nuclear power adopting eliminationalist rhetoric and actions against perceived cultural similarities with Europe?",5062a9d39f4b3db52603322289f179e5eee92861,True,False,,,,,0,1649128956,,0,{},i3g18r2,True,t3_twl388,False,True,t3_twl388,/r/geopolitics/comments/twl388/what_should_russia_do_with_ukraine_translation_of/i3g18r2/,1649128973,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649100156.0,

Also most Middle Eastern nations have stayed quiet on these Russian sanctions including the Western darling, Israel who is as much a fence sitter as India.
Also reality of oil trade has changed when US and Canada began shale oil and gas. Middle Eastern nations would likely prefer to continue having huge reliable customers like India and China than go around competing with US firms.

Also if US were to push Asian nations too far, then that would just be an incentive for China and India to build payment systems and trade channels which circumvent any US sanctions and continue trading with Russia and Iran by not trading in USD.

The current action against Russia where they were kicked out of Swift system will long term do more harm as this will be a lesson and guide for nations like China to develop their own parallel system for future conflicts when they are at odds with US.
