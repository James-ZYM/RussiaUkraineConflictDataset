The only submarines in the Black Sea Fleet are SSK conventional attack submarines. They cannot launch nukes. The Black Sea Fleet has 7 SSK submarines: 1 Kilo class SSK built in 1990, currently being retrofitted and 6 [Improved Kilo class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-class_submarine#Project_636.3_units) SSKs, all activated in 2014. All are diesel-electric and are essentially limited to attacking other ships/subs (though they have some SAMs for defensive purposes). They don't appear to be very good, though. Indonesia was considering buying some, but to quote the Chief of Staff of their navy: ""The submarines look good on the outside, but the inside is filled with broken equipment, and the two submarines have been in storage for two years.""

Overall, this fleet isn't that large. It's mostly meant for the Black Sea waters, patrolling and launching amphibious attacks on land, though mostly using missiles as the fleet currently lacks any ships that can carry aircraft. Their only way to attack land at the moment are 6 landing craft (used to be 7, but Ukraine recently sank one in the Battle of Berdiansk). They have two ""Project 23900"" amphibious assault ships under construction to add to this fleet, capable of carrying mostly anti-submarine helicopters and a couple Ka-52K attack helicopters that could hit land targets or other ships but these ships won't be ready until closer to 2030.",6a5905833614395b6530f4b36ea15066241a2632,True,False,,,,,0,1649951360,,0,{},i4pphiy,False,t3_u3dwi9,False,True,t1_i4p82qz,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u3dwi9/with_the_confirmation_of_moskva_its_a_major_blow/i4pphiy/,1649951378,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649922560.0

[],False,,mexius77,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_1jp7b3u7,False,False,"I think you should have more of a focus on what you are presenting and provide more evidence for your opinions. the list below is some feedback, not trying to be critical so much, as I did watch and enjoy much of it, just felt lacked some solid background.  
  
It sounds like you are stringing together various bits of information to create some story, which seems a bit tenuous.   
For example, you talked about NATO falling apart, I don’t see that happening. You provided no theory for how that could happen.   
Even if the US and France left,  which I doubt, The UK spends as much on its army alone than Russia does, let alone other 24 countries in NATO.  
In terms of the Geo-polities and it is one thing saying Russia's aim is to take Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Moldova.   
But they cannot even take Ukraine, let alone hold it. Attacking any of the NATO nations would cause them all to go to war, this doesn’t necessarily mean Nukes, but side-by-side Russian military doesn’t compared to NATO's.  
  
You also seemed to agree with the conclusion that Russia’s attempted assault on Kyiv was a faint. Totally skipped over the theory that they were being expected to be welcomed like liberators, so were not expecting resistance. And a 6-week faint, isn’t really a faint. Yes, they were/are regrouping, and redeploying after failing to get near enough to Kyiv to encircle it. There were defiantly trying to do that. Russia lost a huge amount of there best elite troops trying to do this.  
  
Other points, Ukraine has stopped recruitment, because they have so many, Russia has just conscripted 100k more (raw troops), They have also asked Syria, Kazakhstan, Belarus and other countries for troops, Kazakhstan said no, Belarus apparently have been unable to persuade their military to take part, Syria said yes, which got publicity, but then said no. Wagner group is pretty small, and if any of them have been watching the news about Russian casualties would be very reluctant to take part.  
  
  
Russia has about 90 operable battalion tactical group (BTG), each made up of 700-1000 men. their morale is extremely low, estimations say that this makes them 1/3rd as affective. Reports in some units say that up to 80% of them are refusing to fight, as an example. Ukraine has seen the results of Russia occupation of towns, and this on only has to make them more motivated, look at Mariupol, for an example of positive moral.  
  
Part of your inspiration was the economist guy, you failed to mention, how the impact of sanctions would destabilise Russia, and its ability to fight. The already closed their only tank factory and have lost about 25% of the total tanks in Russia they had, which is about 2,600. Going on  reports of them breaking down, I would not say that the 2,600 figure was correct. (Which is now nearer 1,800 anyway)  
  
In terms of Russian civilian infrastructure, they effectively have no airline or no car industry. No parts are available for cars lorries, airplanes etc. Factory robots often come from Germany,  software like SAP runs production in every major manufacturing business. Russia has 1 chip manufacturer, which is only good enough to make credit card chips. The worlds microprocessor industry relies on TSMC (Taiwan) and ASML(Holland) , who make the machines that manufacture chips, none of Modern these machines are in China.",e0e353546cdbe643508d0c9acf023cefeb6880b0,False,False,,,,,0,1649948838,,0,{},i4pj0qu,False,t3_u34dwz,False,True,t3_u34dwz,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u34dwz/russoukraine_war_the_dawn_of_the_great_battle_for/i4pj0qu/,1649948857,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649920038.0

Russia doesn't have many good places to build ships that work at a high level. Even their flagship aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was built in Ukraine, by a company called Ukroboronprom (a Ukranian state run company) that builds ships. Ukrainians have long been amazing ship builders...Russians, not so much. They've got some ship building capabilities in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and St. Petersburg, but have only really built small corvettes at these places, which aren't exactly powerful ships.

  
Overall, the Russian Navy is a pile of shit so all of it is, in a way, irreplaceable for the reasons I mentioned above. They could build smaller ships perhaps, but a navy with 400 corvettes is hardly a navy. Most of what they currently have are just old ships built by the Soviets that they brought back to life, trying to modernize them when they could. It's not a very powerful navy in any regard. Half of the navy is just old submarines of various purposes, then a lot of things like patrol boats and small corvettes. But for their larger ships: 1 aircraft carrier, 2 battlecruisers, 3 or more likely 2 cruisers if Moskva is indeed at the bottom of the sea, 10 destroyers, 10 frigates.

I think the current Russian culture is incapable of such reflection and self-insight. It is always somebody else, who is at fault. Truth seems like an abstract/unknown concept to Russia. It is always somebody else, who is at fault - never Russia. They seem historically and culturally incapable of accepting past errors - but prefer to rewrite history to fit their narrative.

As long as that internal process does not take place, the should remain an international pariah and be starved of technology and cooperation. By the very definition, you cannot force this self-reflection on Russia. What you can do is sanction them, so they will hopefully be incapable of committing attrocities at scale for the next many decades.

3-5 years of current sanctions + EU purchasing less and less fossil fuels from them will leave their economy in ruins to an extent, that is hard to envision right now.

...

One thing that was very crucial to Germany becoming a well-functioning democracy and leading European nation after WW2 was their own internal process - accepting guilt and shame - and therefore reconciling with their past. Coming out as a better nation on the other side.

[],False,,LornieH,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_15mavi,False,False,"Battleship Potemkin, sometimes rendered as Battleship Potyomkin, is a 1925 Soviet silent drama film produced by Mosfilm. Directed and co-written by Sergei Eisenstein, it presents a dramatization of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against its officers. It is highly thought of among film critics.   
  
The Odessa Steps sequence  
One of the most celebrated scenes in the film is the massacre of civilians on the Odessa Steps (also known as the Primorsky or Potemkin Stairs). This sequence has been assessed as a ""classic"" and one of the most influential in the history of cinema. In the scene, the Tsar's soldiers in their white summer tunics march down a seemingly endless flight of steps in a rhythmic, machine-like fashion, firing volleys into a crowd. A separate detachment of mounted Cossacks charges the crowd at the bottom of the stairs. The victims include an older woman wearing pince-nez, a young boy with his mother, a student in uniform and a teenage schoolgirl. A mother pushing an infant in a baby carriage falls to the ground dying and the carriage rolls down the steps amid the fleeing crowd.  
  
The massacre on the steps, although it did not take place in daylight or as portrayed, was based on the fact that there were widespread demonstrations in other parts of the city, sparked off by the arrival of the Potemkin in Odessa Harbour. Both The Times and the resident British Consul reported that troops fired on the crowds; deaths were reportedly in the hundreds. Roger Ebert writes, ""That there was, in fact, no tsarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene . It is ironic that \[Eisenstein\] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.

Russia is almost completely ostracized, banned from most major international events like the Olympics.  Domestic travel is severely curtailed and largely limited to train due to a lack of airplane and auto parts.

Sweden, Finland and whatever the Ukranian state looks like are all fully integrated into NATO.  Stripped of their permanent Security Council seat.

I think it's not the first time Serbia got military equipment from China. They also keep getting things from Russia. In the last few years the country has increased its military might more and more. This year they want to spend over a billion € to size it up further. They have very good ties to both China and Russia and there are literally lots of Chinese people living there.

I'm Serbian (not living there) and see what's going on in Serbian media. Since a few years ago they began building lots of new things; highways, buildings, etc and I thought it's all pretty weird. How do they have all the money for this, while most people live in poverty?

But then I realized something: years ago the country applied to join the EU. Since they were poor, they'd get money as development aid. If they'd actually join the EU, they would not necessarily have to strengthen their military that heavily though as they could get help from other EU countries if anything were to happen. I read somewhere that the Chinese and Russian equipment they got is not conforming with EU standards. So... maybe they never actually wanted to join. Maybe all they wanted was the money. Until 2020 they got a total of 2.9 billion €.

There are two points that make things look pretty bad atm:

1. Last year Serbian minister of interior, Aleksandar Vulin said something about how the Serbian people must be united with Belgrade (Serbia's capital) as the governing center. If this doesn't sound familiar to you, you can read about the Yugoslavian wars of the 90s. Montenegro is mostly Serbian (the government too) and in Bosnia about half of the people are Serbian
2. The Bosnian government currently has a bit of a crisis. Since a while ago it's been rather instable. The government consists of three parties: abt a half Bosnian, abt a half Serbian and a Croatian minority.

I would not at all be surprised if, within the next few months or years, Serbia starts a war with Bosnia. As a Serbian myself I hate this. I hate how the country keeps looking back to the past, rather than looking forward to a better future.",f0cae84f30656e7c05887716f2258e803710b5ee,True,False,,,,,0,1649880966,,0,{},i4lzou1,False,t3_u1wtlw,False,True,t3_u1wtlw,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u1wtlw/china_russia_set_to_destabilize_military/i4lzou1/,1649880982,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649852166.0

There is no cognitive dissonance in accepting poll numbers coming out of Russia and disbelieving other propaganda as long as you can provide sound reasoning for doing both.

From what I can find, regarding a specific poll conducted by Levada Center an independent pollster in Russia, is that historically this organization his a track record of being of being reputable in its reporting. As of 4/11 this was their numbers:

&gt;64% of Russians closely monitor the situation around Ukraine. 81% of respondents support the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The dominant feelings among Russians caused by military actions in Ukraine are “pride for Russia” (51%), “anxiety, fear, horror” (31%), “shock” (12%).

CNN also conducted a poll just prior to the invasion that 50% of Russians would support Russia intervening in Ukraine militarily to prevent it from joining NATO.

So we have a pre-war poll from a western source showing 50% of Russians would support military action against Ukraine to prevent it from joining NATO.

Also a Russian source (that, again, is an independent organization that internationally has been recognized as having a solid reputation) saying 81% of respondents currently support the war in Ukraine.  Choosing not to trust their reputation now would just be pure bias on my part.

Maybe people that support the war are more likely to respond, maybe people that respond are afraid to be honest, maybe people support their war because their view is based on lies fed to them, but the numbers are the numbers.

I don't think the 73% identified in the video is not out of the realm of possibility considering the data.",607f309fb62e24e70ff902cfd9e7d6240f1c7a0b,True,False,,,,,0,1649876075,,0,{},i4lnqks,False,t3_u2s86z,False,True,t1_i4lehne,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u2s86z/war_in_ukraine_is_a_direct_genocide_of_the/i4lnqks/,1649876087,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649847275.0

Mariupol offers very little strategic value to the rest of the country. The Sea of Azov was already cut off. Do you even know where Mariupol is on the map? They have made very,very little gains in Donbass outside of the envelopment of Mariupol. The city has literally been under seige and cutoff since D-1. Russia wasted 1000s of their own lives taking the city..while the tiktok chechens shit light poles well behind their lines. Not to mention the only reason you are latching onto this is because it is really the only ""success"" story the Russian forces have outside of Kherson and a small laundry list of Katyn level atrocities committed by their forces.

The 6th CAA and 1st tnak army have literally returned home with less than hakf their force. This is verfied by 1000s of claims. The 4th guards have literally lost over likely 70% of their ready tanks judging by the mass amounts of destroyed, damaged, and abandoned T-80Us before leaving theater(only Russian unit equipped with them). The first tank army and 6th CAA are literally Russia's highest ""readiness"" units. The 8th and 41st CAAs have taken massive casulties in Mariupol

And while I also don't believe Ukranian kill estimates, I do agree with with most 3rd party which is generally still over 10k casulties with confirmed massive loss of equipment and vehicles. And by confirmed i mean literaly picture evidence. You just don't want to believe it. Russia right now has been losing. They changed their lofty goals to a more refined definition in order to save face with dumbasses like you that are eating it up after they used their best forces in their northeastern offensives that objectively failed.

Ukraine will never be apart of Russia again. If Russia manages to turn it around, which is possible but very unlikely, they will be stuck waging counter insurgency operations for decades before they eventually retrograde back. The Soviet-Afghan war was one of the final straws that led to the dissolution of the USSR. If Russia pushes this, it very much can gave the same effects on the Russian Federation. 

As far as sanctions goes, Europe is by far their leading energy consumer. There is no rerouting to another market that will make up those loses. Thats basic macroeconomics. Russia's economy is fucking done. In half a decade Russians steep population decline will accelerate, if they're still a country. Beet and bread lines are coming back.

Those were also not all professional soldiers in a city that has been under seige for the duration. Most were likely militia members pressed inti service. How many Russians died there? The 8th CAA is spent in Mariupol and very likely combat ineffective now.  The Russians lost Mykolaiv and were pushed back to Kherson.

This is an unwinnable war..but mot for Ukraine. Russia has already lost..by conservative and confirmed estimates, a quarter of their effective armor forces. The 4 guards tank division is literally fukky exhausted (confirmed by the lack of T-80Us) Over 40BTGs have left Ukraine due to being spent. Russian forces have made very little realized gains. Russia has lost more than 1000 forces in and around Mariupol.

This second phase you shills talk about is a sham. Its not real. Its because Russia lost many of their best forces and equipment and have expended much of their more expensive smart munitions..that they can no longer replace. They now have to focus on the only AO they haven't outright failed at, and even then there successes have been exceptionally limited.
