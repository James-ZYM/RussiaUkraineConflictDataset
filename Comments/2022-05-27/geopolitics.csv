In all, in future Europe in general will be come really less relevant (not obsolete) but it will still be a great tourist destination. As countries develop, the economic size will align with number of people a country has, so Europe will shrink in every other measure.

Barely.

[https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=XC](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=XC)

EU's issues largely stem from a lack of initiatives and separation of fiscal and monetary policy. For example, Italy is a debt-ridden nation, where an interest rate hike can make the situation worse, while Germany has little debt and an overheating economy, where an interest rate hike is needed. As the end result of this scenario, no action is taken, and German consumers and exporters get massacred from skyrocketing input costs, as is happening right now. 

[https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Prices/Producer-Price-Index-For-Industrial-Products/\_node.html](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economy/Prices/Producer-Price-Index-For-Industrial-Products/_node.html)

Furthermore, the EU critically lacks development in high-growth fields. The European tech industry is a shadow of its American counterpart, and really only acts as a labour pool for American firms so they can recruit talent from elite European institutions to produce products that they can sell to the European market. EU has been totally incapable of growing a domestic tech industry, and additionally largely ceded control of the global financial services industry to American banks post-2008.  
Despite having a lower GDP per Capita both nominal and real, and having the numbers 'on their side', due to a massive trade bloc and being on average poorer, Eurozone citizens on average are getting richer at a slower rate than their American counterparts.

Apologies for the repeated comparisons to the US economy, but the logic here largely holds true for Asia Pacific and South Asian countries, where the industries and GDP/C is growing at a significantly faster rate than the Eurozone ones.

To summarise, IMO, the worst aspect of the EU is the economics, and in general, over time we have seen the rest of the world accelerate in growth while the Eurozone stays 'stagnant'.",320e26e161f356a723b5c5ecbb33caadc46ab0a5,True,False,,,,,0,1653685419,,0,{},ia8mun5,False,t3_uyftcv,False,True,t1_ia8jikx,/r/geopolitics/comments/uyftcv/what_are_you_predictions_for_the_eu_will_it_grow/ia8mun5/,1653685430,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653656619.0,[],text,t2_gn2uwda,False,False

I guess that's what I meant. India will only align on overlapping interests. It will never be an ally. And I think that is a good thing.

They will have Indian support. India is buying military equiments from them for next 15 years at least. The other option is Indigenization.

Thomas Friedman, an international relations thinker belonging to the liberal school of thought had predicted that if two countries had McDonald's chains, they will not go to war with wach other. 

The premise is that enough economic interdependence can ensure peace between countries. In a cruder language, people would prefer to stand in lines for McDonald's burgers rather than go to the borders. It means that economic interests can trump nations' security concerns and hence globalism (extreme interdependence) is the way to go for world peace.

However the premise stands shattered now, and the McDonald's restaurants shuttered. 

The article goes into the Indian experience with the theory as well. Since the early 1990s, India has sought to manage its territorial disputes with China by keeping the boundary issues frozen at the status quo level while concentrating on trade and commerce. 

However, earlier this year our Foreign Minister S Jaishankar too had brushed past this line of thought. Asked when relations with China would normalise, he has made it clear that [relations with China hinge on the state of the border](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-relations-with-china-going-through-very-difficult-phase-jaishankar/article65066809.ece). That is, security trumps all economic interests.

This was the clearest insight into Indian government thinking since the border crisis. The reception that Chinese FM received in India too echoed this line of thinking, a message that the Chinese should have received clearly.

But here is my 2 cents... 

The idea is great, the application is not. Getting 27 individual nations to consistently agree to pull in the same direction is and always will be a herculean task - just look at the EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

I read a quote somewhere that said the EU has never overcome any obstacles - it had only ever managed to outlive them. It's trajectory since the Great Financial Crisis would largely suggest that this viewpoint is largely correct.

My feeling is that the current economic and political climate will prove too much for the Union unless drastic changes are implemented in how it is structured. Federalisation is key to its long term success and I find it hard to see how that will ever come to fruition.

Federalisation would require debt transfers and member states ceding their sovereignty to a supranational organisation and that will always prove a step too far for the average man on the street. 

The bloc doesn't have an army or a common foreign policy and there are hugely different views on how to appropriately manage an economy from state to state - and this is before we get to the fact that there are 24 official languages. 

The bloc will always be dominated by either France or Germany because they are the 2 great powers of the continent and this has been the case for the last 500 years.

I am not sure if anything was declared behind the scenes, but on the surface it seems Morocco has stopped deploying refugees to disrupt the Plazas de Soberania, so it would appear that at least for now Morocco has slightly backed down. On the other side Spain abandoned its long-standing backing of Western Saharan independence for a negotiated autonomy arrangement, which seems to have been sufficient for Morocco's desires. Fundamentally it seems that both sides need each other. Spain needs Morocco because with Russia now becoming Europe's adversary they need an alternative source of fossil fuels. In addition, Spanish workers need the employment opportunities Morocco provides to make a living. But this economic connection applies in reverse too. The reason Morocco has become wealthy unlike its neighbours is due to significant investment from Western countries in its economies. Moroccan lives, economic activity and amenities all require continued cooperation with Spain. Remember what happened when the naval cadets tried to take over Perejil? Spain easily defeated the attempt, and Morocco backed down to avoid war. Morocco's army is decent, but it is still trying to gain strength and does not have the ability to conduct the sustained urban offensives just yet. Look at how much trouble the POLISARIO Front are causing them despite the Sahrawis operating from empty desert with rare oasis towns. Sure, the Moroccans managed to capture Gueguerat after a Crimea-style operation, but that was unsecured by the Sahrawis and too far from the Western Saharan headquarters. Despite having engaged in war ever since, they have been unable to expand past the old ceasefire line significantly, with the Polisario even apparently able to attack Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara according to their own propaganda. If the Moroccan forces are having this much trouble with a small inferiorly-armed group, it would be extremely difficult for them to take on the might of the well-equipped Spanish military. Morocco would also be throwing their economy away, as war would make their infrastructure targets for Spain. This infrastructure is expensive and important, so losing them through attacks from Spain would be quite painful. Even if Spain limited its efforts to the Gibraltar Straits that would still be destroying places like Tangier and Al-Huceima  which are important for Morocco. So Morocco would stand to lose more than it could possibly win if it were to attack so soon, plus it has a comfortable business relationship with Spain , so I find it unlikely they would choose war anytime soon. It's a bit like how China does not want to attack Taiwan as Taiwan has islands in Fujian which could be used to damage Chinese economic assets, on top of the cosy business relationship they have anyway.",53c611b8a58bfcff3e364b90126ab10ffd3ff077,True,False,,,,,0,1653662426,,0,{},ia75bj5,False,t3_uyhp2h,False,True,t3_uyhp2h,/r/geopolitics/comments/uyhp2h/spanish_moroccan_situation/ia75bj5/,1653662446,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653633626.0,[],text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False

Russia considers itself a democracy, but the rest of the world doesn’t. Yet only twenty years ago Russia was seen as a democracy, despite having the same people in charge and the same system as they do now. They seem to have no qualms waging war against Ukraine, which holds democratic elections. 

What is and isn’t considered a democracy may change over time, as governments around the world trend one way or another.

There are already some that view the United States as “not a proper democracy” due to the electoral system resulting in a lack of equal one person one vote.  

If all countries were to have some form of democracy that most people in the developed world would agree with today, there’s a chance that in a few decades that views will diverge and certain types of democracy are considered no longer sufficiently democratic. 

And even if all countries were democratic, many underlying problems that cause war are unresolved. Resource inequality, border friction, historical animosities… these are all things that don’t disappear just because the government has changed. It might also risk sudden populism, even if it does not fall into autocratic rule, causing a war in a spur of passion if it happened to occur at the wrong time. 

So while I think there is the possibility of a reduced risk of war between nations if they all became what we like to consider “democratic”, the chance is not zero, and we will still inevitably will see conflict. Once that conflict does happen, it’s quite likely that both sides will call the other side non-democratic to try and justify their position.",2df425a52cbf9bfd0f10d89fc0762dfa381a14db,True,False,,,,,0,1653662274,,0,{},ia74yhy,False,t3_uyoy8d,False,True,t3_uyoy8d,/r/geopolitics/comments/uyoy8d/do_you_think_if_every_country_in_the_world_was_a/ia74yhy/,1653662288,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653633474.0,[],text,t2_mz2cm,False,False

Britanicca also says Taiwan was Dutch for 40 years. So that would mean as soon as the Dutch landed on Taiwan all of Taiwan became Dutch. As soon as the English landed in Ireland it doesn't mean all of Ireland became English.  It's more complicated than that. The Qing landed on Taiwan and started by controlling a small part of Taiwan, over time they controlled more and more and so you could say more and more became part of the Qing. 

How much the Qing controlled (or how much was part of the Qing) at what time I don't know, but we can look at the only primary source that either of us have supplied to get some information (I'll link it a second time). 

http://www.taiwandocuments.org/1874treaty.htm

The agreement is that China will pay Japan compensation for killed Japanese citizens (that's the only thing you mention). It also says China will pay Japan an much larger amount for the military base infrastructure that Japan built and Japan agrees to remove their forces from Taiwan (ie Japan will remove their military base from Taiwan). 

Finally China agrees to  control the savages

""It will be the duty of the Chinese Government to take such steps for the due control of the savage tribes in the regions referred to as will for ever secure the navigation [along their coasts] against any further atrocities on their part.""

This implies that not all of the coast of Taiwan was under Chinese control before 1874 and presumeably after 1874 at least the coast was supposed to be enough under Chinese control that they could stop the natives from killing shipwrecked sailors. Of course then there are the mountainous internal regions of Taiwan, don't know if China ever controlled  that area (remember the natives in Taiwan are often called mountain people, and if you have gone to Taiwan you might know there are still primarily native areas in the mountains). 

So I'm just saying at the earliest China controlled (owned/had) all of Taiwan after 1874 (and maybe never, I don't know exactly what happened between 1874 and 1895). 

&gt;If inhabitants were not ruled by Chinese, they wouldn't rebel against them:

Yes the Qing controlled/ruled part of Taiwan. 

&gt;At some point, Qing empire agreed to reimburse Japan for actions of Taiwanese tribesmen, so they did consider those same tribesmen their subjects:

This is only a small part of the agreement. Remember the large part of the sum paid (80% of it) is for the Japanese base and to get the Japanese out of Taiwan (only 20% is for compensation). If they didn't pay the Japanese would have maintained their base in Taiwan, and so part of Taiwan would have become Japanese. 

Also I doubt that the Qing considered the Taiwanese ""savages"" to be Chinese citizens.",d8833545fc9dcec0e505ac59de4cab5366b9b84c,True,False,,,,,0,1653658597,,0,{},ia6wqyc,False,t3_uxfpht,False,True,t1_ia4ldko,/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/ia6wqyc/,1653658609,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653629797.0,[],text,t2_532t6j7o,False,False

Even if the conflict finished right now, Russia annexing all the territory it just took, Russia will not recover from this economically or militarily for decades.

If this flotilla of fishing ships is harassing and actively blocking ships from reaching Taiwan, then attacking those ships would be absolutely justified. The world would see this for what it truly is: an underhanded attempt by the CCP to starve Taiwan into submission. No one is going to sympathize with China or the fishermen from that point on and the Taiwanese would have every legal right to defend their waters since they would be actively threatened with starvation.

And besides, what's Beijing going to do once those fishing boats start getting sunk? Blockade with their own naval vessels which would only incite an American and Japanese response? The PLAN simply don't have the capacity to wage a naval war with the US, Japan and Taiwan. An attempted blockade with a fleet of fishing boats would be a huge embarrassment since it wouldn't put Taiwan in a bind and Beijing would be unable to back this up with force without dragging in outside powers.",9c979cab037d4b6b65704c21a42fed192cbc4a75,True,False,,,,,0,1653611664,,0,{},ia4vdlb,False,t3_uxfpht,False,True,t1_ia4stgu,/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/ia4vdlb/,1653611677,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653582864.0,[],text,t2_7nbqtzz4,False,False

The picture I see is one where a thousand fishing boats are all glomming up the works. Attacking such a flotilla with missiles and heavy weapons would look like a huge escalation and an over-reaction. (If more fishing boats come in to rescue the crews of the sunken boats, do you sink them too while they're fishing people out of the water, or do you wait until everyone is safely aboard?) 

Such an escalation could be seen as justified if the choice was either that or starvation. I expect China will make it a different choice - Taipei only needs to contact Beijing and ask the PRC for permission to allow the food through. You see how that shifts the context? Now Taiwan's choice is between slaughter, and pride. 

China will allow the slaughter to continue long enough for their purposes, and then they'll act ""in self-defense"" to eliminate the offensive threat posed by Taiwan's navy and air force. So all that Taiwan can really accomplish by butchering the fishing vessels is to make the world want this to be over. 

And remember - China isn't the US. It won't be demanding ""unconditional surrender"" from Taiwan. The terms they'll ask for will allow Taiwan (and the US) to avoid humiliation. It will be something like ""one country two systems"" again, with guarantees for TSMC's continued operation without PRC interference or espionage. They'll do everything they can to appear reasonable. The American approach would be to bomb the hell out of Taiwan and force regime change - China will gain the maximum by showing that a bit of cleverness can make all the aircraft carriers in the world irrelevant.",42c491e8f86dd2a9d54c432a6992e3e955633786,True,False,,,,,0,1653610426,,0,{},ia4stgu,False,t3_uxfpht,False,True,t1_ia4gsid,/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/ia4stgu/,1653610442,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653581626.0,[],text,t2_7n1sq,False,False
