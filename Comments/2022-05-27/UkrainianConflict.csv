It's a distinction without a difference with the result of Russia sinking its claws deeper into the EU via dependency on Russian fossil fuels. The motivations for the Germans and Russians to agree to such arrangements mean little once the contracts are in force.

This would be like saying that the Americans' intent to spread democracy in Iraq by removing Saddam Hussein and all would end well is ultimately excusable because it was just misguided but not evil.

Most ordinary Germans indeed stand behind Ukraine, but anyone can legitimately stand behind Ukraine yet also start ""asking questions"" about the feasibility of a hard embargo on Russian fossil fuels. The net result is a dilution of sanctions no matter how many refugees Germany hosts or earnestly non-Querdenker sympathize with or support Ukrainians.

Germany could host over 3 million Ukrainian refugees like its poorer neighbour to the east (i.e. Poland) but that wouldn't move the needle on the own-goal stemming from the farce of Ostpolitik. In addition, talking up Germany's donations to Ukraine since 2014 in financial aid and similar is a convenient deflection of how much more Germany contractually agreed to pay Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft for fossil fuels over the *decades*.

How more defensive Germans act is like some ""friend"" who's trying desperately to salve his conscience by reassuring his now-homeless neighbour of how much support he now offers with money, food and free lodging, all while ignoring the inconvenient truth that this ""friend"" consistently enabled and made excuses for the arsonist for many years right up to the moment he torched the neighbour's house despite all the red flags and warnings by other people.",15b2156643df96dbdee3eefed6d0afbc929e2c12,True,False,,,,,0,1653694560,,0,{},ia95hc5,False,t3_uz3fc9,False,True,t1_ia8rtd0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3fc9/in_eastern_europe_the_image_of_the_ugly_german_is/ia95hc5/,1653694572,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653665760.0,

3. This is the one that's most practical.  I wouldn't stress too much about sanctions being lifted anytime soon.  Russia is the new North Korea in that sense.

4. I'm sure arms are being twisted all over the place.  These are Europeans we're taking about though, they've never gotten along with each other very well and I'm sure they hate taking orders from Americans.

But failure to agree the oil embargo has held up the implementation of other elements of the sanctions package, including disconnecting Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, from the Swift messaging system and banning Russian broadcasters from the EU.

In his overnight address, Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, hit out at EU divisions over the latest sanctions package.

He said: “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package? Of course I am grateful to those friends who are advocating new sanctions. But where do the people blocking this sixth package get their power from? Why are they allowed to hold such power?”

Olaf Scholz, the Germany chancellor, raised further questions about how Germany was prepared to show its support for Ukraine on Friday in a tweet that said: “Can violence be fought with violence? Can you only create peace without weapons?

“One thing is clear. We support Ukraine so that violence does not become the norm.”",64aae9daae3b091504d2fc83935d0ff8f1444d5e,True,False,,,,,0,1653691756,,0,{},ia8zxgw,True,t3_uz9wjw,False,True,t1_ia8zwpv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz9wjw/germany_deliberately_watering_down_eu_embargo_on/ia8zxgw/,1653691770,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653662956.0,

**Diplomats accuse Berlin of hijacking talks in order to secure wider concessions that would benefit its own economy**

Germany was on Friday accused of deliberately watering down the EU’s planned embargo on Russian oil imports to benefit its own economy.

European sources told The Telegraph that Berlin wanted an exemption for deliveries via pipeline to be extended from Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the entire bloc.

In a bid to unblock talks over the EU’s sixth package of sanctions against Moscow, German officials – who had previously backed a full ban – proposed only imposing the embargo on sea shipments of Russian oil.

It comes as EU countries scramble to agree a deal in time for leaders to endorse it at a summit early next week.

The move was originally negotiated in order to win over landlocked Hungary – which has so far blocked the EU’s latest round of sanctions – and give it more time to rearrange its supplies away from Russian oil.

But an EU diplomat said Germany hijacked the talks in order to secure wider concessions that would benefit its own economy.

“Initially it was about giving Viktor Orban space, but now Germany has seen it as an opportunity to help itself. Germany has pushed for this… to narrow the scope of the sanctions on Russia,” the diplomat said.

Hungary was seen as the main holdout against the EU’s attempts to end imports of Russian oil by the end of the year.

Budapest, which is reliant on pipeline deliveries from Russia, has blocked the sixth package of sanctions because it cannot easily get oil from elsewhere.

“It would be humiliating... to remove the oil embargo part of the package completely only to push through the other elements,” an EU official said.

“So the idea is to have an embargo on Russian oil and exempt the Russian Druzhba pipeline supplying Hungary only for some time, to give the European Commission and Hungary time to solve the problem.”

Because the majority of Russian oil to Europe is delivered by tankers, a ban on seaborne imports would still have a significant impact.",a6399a10d81dceaae06c660c4864b32f141f2df6,True,False,,,,,0,1653691746,,0,{},ia8zwpv,True,t3_uz9wjw,False,True,t3_uz9wjw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz9wjw/germany_deliberately_watering_down_eu_embargo_on/ia8zwpv/,1653691763,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653662946.0,

Oh, do we? You certainly did not write that.

Even if you refuse to understand the meaning of ""training"", i guess the ukrainians currently training in germany simply do not exist in your imaginery world?

&gt; Literally Germany's fault. 

That was a pretty unilaterial decision by NATO, you will find similar statements by most if not all member states. But who cares about the truth, right?

&gt; Yeah, but it's rather your failure than your contribution, YOu worked hard to make it happen.

Yeah sure, keep dreaming. Must be nice to live in such a simple world where everything is black or white

&gt; Your country sabotages heavy weapons deliveries.

**They are being trained on.** Holy shit, are you mentally twelve or have a reading disorder?

&gt; Your financial help to Russia is many orders of magnitude larger than your donations to Ukraine. 

Just like the rest of europe. Germany isnt that special in any way besides being one of the largest countries, therefore also having the largest economy and therefore gas volumes. Especially eastern europe, which some braindead idiots are now calling clairvoyant as they allegedly have predicted all of this, is just as dependent.

&gt; You block major sanctions against Russia

Such as? Using sanctions which hurt the EU less than russia is the only sensible way as they are supposed to stay for a *really* long time. Germany is taking the largest economical hit due to the sanctions and is still supporting them, both in 2014 and now.

&gt; You made this war happen by your criminal foreign policy. 

Lol. Keep dreaming mate, is there anything else left in your brain besides ""germany bad""?

&gt; And you are incapable to recognize any mistake.

Nope, calling bullshit what it is isnt being incabable of recognizing mistakes. I'm not happy with germanys foreign policies since years, but that doesnt mean i will leave your bullshit stand here uncorrected. Being an angry guy from ukraine doesnt mean you are right in any way.

&gt; And it's never Germany.

Yeah, its germany like 1-2 weeks later. Boohoo, big story. Its almost like there are talks in the backgrounds between all countries delivering stuff which random idiots from reddit arent involved in

&gt; You are the lost case anyway. 

You may wanna rethink who is the lost cause here. I'm certainly not the one channeling all the hate i can muster into one of the countries *supporting* ukraine just because of dumb circlejerks in reddit megathreads.

1.  A non-American NATO nation needs to free Odessa’s shipping by escorting the grain and humanitarian relief. Let Russia fucking deal with it. I know there are many Canadian sailors who would take that job. Turkey would have to consent, so buy their backing off. Maintain the protective corridor in and out of Odessa for UN relief and Red Cross.  Find a legal framework under UN auspices to justify this as humanitarian.

2.  The US military needs to take the chains off transfers of military equipment, even if that require extraordinary levels of commitment to tracking the gear (e.g., John Deere tractor level theft tracking).  If the Saudis can buy something, Ukraine should have that gear since they’re far more trustworthy and aren’t using it to slaughter Yemeni children. This is likely already happening (weapons systems require operators to be trained and sufficient infrastructure to deploy and maintain them), we just don’t see it right now.  

3.  Formalize the requirements that all Russian and Belorussian sanctions are permanent until the 2014 Ukrainian borders are restored.

4.  The US needs to twist arms to get everyone back on a single message where that is appropriate and maintain vagueness where needed (clamp down unauthorized chatter and disagreement). The point is that world leaders need to step in line because a united front is absolutely required here.

5.  Formalize and unite the west behind the cost of war crimes.  Ensure that the UA is crystal clear in demonstrating that they are doing the opposite of Russia at every turn. They can’t just be choir boys, they need to tell everyone how pious they are. No cluster munitions or any legally prohibited arms/actions. Russia will ‘what about’ everything they can at the UN— anyone siding with them shouldn’t have a leg to stand on.",88e3f10687b42cccd0a99c9cbfd2aa64fbe25457,True,False,,,,,0,1653691071,,0,{},ia8yjjh,False,t3_uyuoup,False,False,t1_ia7m1ox,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyuoup/stop_playing_with_russia_end_war_zelensky_tells/ia8yjjh/,1653691085,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653662271.0,

382,[],False,,Aenness,,,[],,,,text,t2_kx77anvv,False,True,"Russian troops are making steady progress in Ukraine’s east on the back of more-concentrated artillery and air power, now controlling almost all of the Luhansk region and threatening to encircle thousands of Ukraine’s most experienced troops.

That is sparking fears that Russia could be poised for a bigger breakthrough, and leading to increasingly panicked calls from Kyiv for even more powerful offensive weapons.

Russia’s capture of a series of towns including Popasna means its forces hold 95% of the Luhansk region that makes up the northern half of the Donbas area. On Friday, Ukraine’s military command said Russian troops were pushing on from Popasna toward the town of Bakhmut, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west, seeking to isolate Ukrainian forces in a pocket of government-held territory around Sievierodonetsk.


UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the Russian gains as “slow, but I’m afraid palpable, progress,” in a Bloomberg interview. He also backed Ukrainian demands for supplies of longer range multiple launch rocket, or MLRS, systems as “where the world needs to go.”


The recent Russian gains appear at least in part to be the products of past Ukrainian success. By mounting so effective a defense that Russian commanders had to withdraw from around the country’s two largest cities – Kyiv and Kharkiv – Ukraine also drove them to abandon a wildly over-ambitious battle plan that had left their troops thinly spread and too far from logistical lifelines.

Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk described the change in the Russian approach to the war as “colossal” at a briefing this week. Russian commanders now take fewer risks and ensure better air cover as they pursue scorched earth tactics. That increasingly entails leveling Ukrainian defenses with extended artillery barrages before attempting to secure territory.

A sense that the tide of the war could be turning in favor of the likely narrowed goals of President Vladimir Putin comes as some, including former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, call for Ukraine to consider trading territory for a cease-fire.


Yet how to interpret the Russian advances has sharply divided military analysts, with many warning against drawing conclusions from incremental movements on a relatively small part of the battlefield that earlier this month saw Russia suffer major losses in a failed attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets river.

Just as previous Russian setbacks led to an over-optimistic consensus on Ukraine’s ability to win the war, relatively minor gains are now driving the kind of pessimism reflected in Kissinger’s remarks, Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King’s College London, wrote in a Friday blog [post](https://archive.ph/o/JyIE8/https://samf.substack.com/p/how-long-will-the-war-last?r=15i4j0&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email).

“This indicates the ever-present danger for those analyzing the course of this war of getting too far ahead of events on the ground,” Freedman wrote. “The best assessment of Russian strategy now is that it seeks to take what it can from the current effort and then dare Ukraine to try to seize it back.”

So far Ukrainian commanders have not taken that bait, either because they are building up reserves and awaiting the arms needed from the US and other allies to make a successful counter-offensive possible, or because they are themselves suffering heavy losses and cannot.

In the longer term, the arrival of ever more powerful weapons and fresh Ukrainian volunteers, combined with the steady attrition of Russian forces and equipment, suggests the slow pace of movement on the battlefield favors Ukraine, according to a weekly update by Rochan Consulting, a Warsaw-based group that closely follows the war.

“Time is working in Ukraine’s favor,” Rochan said in the [report](https://archive.ph/o/JyIE8/https://rochan-consulting.com/issue-80-9-15-may-2022-weekly-update/). “Unless Russia conducts mobilization (general or partial), its armed forces will not only stall over the next few weeks, but the influx of Western weaponry and Ukrainian personnel will allow Kyiv to start pushing Russian units back along a much broader front.” 



In Moscow, Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said this week that Russia had no deadlines to meet in pursuing its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Yet there are dangers for the administration of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, even from the limited win that Russia’s capture of the Sievierodonetsk pocket would represent for Putin, according to Mykola Bielieskov, a military analyst at Ukraine’s National Institute for Strategic Studies, a government think tank.

With Russian artillery now in reach of supply roads to the pocket, Ukraine’s commanders face difficult choices: To bring in reinforcements under fire, to withdraw under fire, or mount a Mariupol-style defense after encirclement, in the hope that a counter-offensive and relief will come in time.

“All options are militarily and politically risky,” Bielieskov said, speaking by phone from Kyiv. “It’s very difficult to explain to Ukrainians why the Russians still have the ability to move forward, after being rolled back from Kyiv and Kharkiv. So even if it is not a major success, this local success would have negative repercussions for the government.”

Bielieskov blamed the slowness of even the US administration to make the move from giving Ukraine’s soldiers what they need to survive Russian attacks, to giving them what’s required to compete with Russia’s quantitative advantage in artillery and mount counter-offensives. 

Rather than the 90 howitzers the US has promised to date, Ukraine needs 400 to 500, as well as MLRS with ranges of at least 70 to 80 kilometers, weapons that will allow it to damage Russian forces and firepower at depth, according to Bielieskov.  

Yet despite Johnson’s support and a CNN [report](https://archive.ph/o/JyIE8/https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/26/politics/us-long-range-rockets-ukraine-mlrs/index.html) that the US is preparing to green light sending MLRS to Ukraine, the administration in Washington has been hesitant, worrying that the missiles - some of which have a range of 300 kilometers - might be used to strike deep inside Russia, according to CNN and others. 

A senior defense department official said Thursday that no decision had been taken, meaning even if the US goes ahead it would be weeks before any of the systems appear on the front lines.

“Washington decided that Russia will not be allowed to prevail militarily, but it is doing that in a piecemeal fashion and there remains no consensus to deliver enough weapons, quickly enough to turn Ukraine’s defense to offense,” said Bielieskov. “Remember that although the Russians are being bled, so are we.”",e6087c3659d8912c43ec61708dfd3c1940ee5da8,True,False,,,,,0,1653690668,,0,{},ia8xq7d,True,t3_uz87i4,False,True,t3_uz87i4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz87i4/russian_wins_in_eastern_ukraine_spark_debate_over/ia8xq7d/,1653690680,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653661868.0,

&gt; So does germany, even if you deny it.

Your country sabotages heavy weapons deliveries. Your financial help to Russia is many orders of magnitude larger than your donations to Ukraine. You block major sanctions against Russia. You made this war happen by your criminal foreign policy. And you are incapable to recognize any mistake.

&gt; Again: No other country has send western IFVs or tanks.

So fucking what? Whatever is delivered it's always one of the countries that does it the first. And it's never Germany. And when the others deliver, you keep guessing why there was a valid reason not to do that.

&gt; And thats a load of bullshit. Why am i even wasting my time with you, 

So don't waste it. You are the lost case anyway. Just one of the stereotypical Germans that will never accept any criticism from a dirty foreigner.

1) Putin and his circle must die for all what they have done

2) Russian people have a long way to go to atone for their sins, for allowing this monster to rise to power just like Germany did for its Hitler. 

The gangsters operate simple: if they sense you are weak they will crush you, no negotiations work with them as they see it as a sign of weakness. The only way to deal with them is to crush them to a pulp. Europe with its Macrons, Sholtzs and others are weak and probably paid  and bought by russia.

[Uhm... thats literally a lie?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) That list is pretty fucking long and countries like the czech republic and slovenia sent their tanks to ukraine with promises of getting free german replacements.

&gt; And received no support and ""fuck you"" instead of NATO

Not germanys fault.

&gt; After the second revolution we received Steinmeyer's plan and another ""fuck you""

Be happy that you didnt receive total russian annexation back then. Again: Ukrainian politicians sat at the table and also negotiated these agreements, even if they now act like they didnt.

&gt; Oh, now you are not poor Germany without army and hardware, but a contributor. 

What the german army posseses is barely enough for defending the NATO flanks and still not enough even for that purpose. If you dont understand that germany more or less *has* a border with russia due to the EU and NATO and would be fighting for the baltics or eastern europe you have not understood NATO at all. There is no contradiction here, pretty much all heavy equipment of the german army is currently engaged or being prepared for NATO duties as we are leading one of the response forces in the baltics in the coming years.

&gt; Guess which country is literally defending Estonia and you right now?

Doesnt mean its a good idea to strip your army naked. Which is something *no* country does for ukraine. Your demands are seriously ridiculous.

&gt; And guess which country sabotages the delivery of heavy weapons for this army?

Well, certainly not germany. Again: The ukrainian troops are literally training on them right now, its really not that hard to understand.

&gt; I would if they won't send hundreds of units of heavy weapons and kept supplying.

""Hundreds of units of heavy weapons"" - such as? They send around a 100 howitzers. Certainly not tanks or IFVs of which there would be plenty to spare. Following your logic they should send them all so why arent you crying about that. It would certainly be more helpful than the handful that could be spared from german units (even if you'd receive every equipment the german army possesses its nothing compared to the stuff the US could spare without even feeling it, so why the insane focus on germany?).

&gt; So please don't mention the US - they do help. 

So does germany, even if you deny it.

&gt; No. All the arguments about Marders are purely speculation. Germany hasn't approve the export. That's it.

Again: No other country has send western IFVs or tanks. Why the focus on germany? Because the german industry leaked stuff to the press to add pressure on the government? Its questionable if there is ammunition and the vehicles are *still* being refurbished right now, no matter if the delivery is approved or not.

*****
&gt; More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show, in what looks to be the clearest indication yet of dissent among some parts of security forces over Moscow&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine.

&gt; The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, came to light on Wednesday, after a local Russian court rejected their collective lawsuit that challenged their earlier sacking.

&gt; According to the court&amp;#039;s decision, published on its website, the lawsuit was dismissed after the judge determined that the soldiers had been rightfully fired for &amp;quot;Refusing to perform an official assignment&amp;quot; to fight in Ukraine and instead returned to a duty station.

Because ""everyone else"" have sent something. Some of them have sent enough to help. While Germany hasn't sent anything and even the announced amounts are a joke.

&gt; Hell ukraine even had a revolution 6 years later and the majority of ukrainians had no interest in joining NATO back then

We had a revolution short before we applied for NATO membership plan. And received no support and ""fuck you"" instead of NATO. After the second revolution we received Steinmeyer's plan and another ""fuck you"", and Russia has received NS2. Every our movement towards democracy, towards the west, was answered with a push back to Russia. Just because Russian money doesn't smell.

&gt;  ""You are in NATO"" is something you can say for smaller countries, not the ones who would be one of the major contributors of manpower and machinery in a war.

Oh, now you are not poor Germany without army and hardware, but a contributor. 

&gt; Guess which army will be moving to defend estonia in case of an invasion?

Guess which country is literally defending Estonia and you right now? And guess which country sabotages the delivery of heavy weapons for this army?

&gt; What a ridiculous take. If thats your mindset, go complain about the US not sending their 6000 M1 Abrams - they even have an ocean between them and russia.

I would if they won't send hundreds of units of heavy weapons and kept supplying. So please don't mention the US - they do help. Yes, their reaction could be stronger and faster, but they are many orders of magnitude ahead of Germany.

&gt; First of all: They are not excuses. They are facts

No. All the arguments about Marders are purely speculation. Germany hasn't approve the export. That's it. 

&gt; Calling everything you dont like ""excuses"" isnt making your arguments any good.

Those are exactly excuses. Your country despite its capabilities sabotages the deliveries.

From wiki:

 breakthrough occurs when an offensive force has broken or penetrated an opponent's defensive line, and rapidly exploits the gap.
Usually, large force is employed on a relatively small portion of the front to achieve this. While the line may have held for a long while prior to the breakthrough, the breakthrough marks a relatively small time-frame where the pressure on the defender leads him to ""snap"" in a very short time span.
As the first defensive unit breaks, the adjacent units suffer adverse results from this (spreading panic, additional defensive angles, threat to supply lines). Since they were already pressured, this leads them to ""snap"" as well, causing a domino-style collapse of the defensive system. The defensive force thus evaporates at the breakthrough point, giving the attacker the option to rapidly move troops into the gap, exploiting the breakthrough in width (by attacking enemy units at the edge of the breakthrough, so widening it), in depth (advancing into enemy territory towards strategic objectives), or a combination of both",215dd58c05de389e5ac103af18cab16757b17512,True,False,,,,,0,1653688309,,0,{},ia8svu7,False,t3_uz1r60,False,True,t1_ia82v5o,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz1r60/it_feels_like_the_darkest_hour_since_february_for/ia8svu7/,1653688324,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653659509.0,

Russia lost the ability to truly win this war weeks or even months ago. This kind of inch by inch advance with overwhelming artillery fire is what they're still capable of doing. But at this pace they're never going to take Ukraine's big cities, and Ukraine has time to arm its reserves, to receive and train on modern NATO equipment and for sanctions to reach their full effect.

So did everyone else, why focus on germany? Also it was only candidate status and to be quite frank: It was absolutely justified. Hell you even had a revolution 6 years later and the majority of ukrainians had no interest in joining NATO - that only changed in 2013-2014. Again: Unless you have a time machine there is literally no reason to discuss such things.

&gt; You could definitely donate something from army and safely wait several months until the replacement is produced. 

Thats whats being done? Germany is still one of the largest militaries in western europe and NATO allies like the baltics rely on the german army to defend themself.

&gt; Now look at Estonia. And compare your GDP and your industrial capabilities and your geographical position with their. 

Guess which army will be moving to defend estonia in case of an invasion?

&gt; 328 tanks? And you need them here and now? Going to invade France?

What a ridiculous take. If thats your mindset, go complain about the US not sending their 6000 M1 Abrams - they even have an ocean between them and russia.

I'm not sure if you dont want to understand or arent able to. These ""largest manufacturers"" produce a handful of tanks each year and only if you order them a couple of years earlier. Its really not that hard - producing modern arms takes *a lot* of time.

It is a situational awareness gap, caused by lack of good information about what happens behind Russian lines. The Russians barely have a clue or else that would leak.

What is leaking is that the Russians are keeping units in the line with over 50% casualties and 75% equipment losses, not even counting walking wounded that are left on the line as long they can still pull a trigger and damaged or broken vehicles and equipment that is kept in use.

They would not do that if those units were exceptions. They are merely the extreme where units are pulled back with heavy losses being widely reported.

644,[],False,,SailsForce,,,[],,,,text,t2_g1mh6,False,True,"Wars end. Many, if not most, end with negotiation. That might be what happens with the war Russia launched against Ukraine on Feb. 24, too, though one former Moscow regime member warns against urging Ukraine to negotiate while President Vladimir Putin is still bent on more conquest. “You just can’t make peace now,” Boris Bondarev, who recently resigned from his mid-level Russian Foreign Ministry post to protest the war, said in an interview with Puck. “If you do, it will be seen as a Russian victory.” That would just encourage the Putin regime to exploit a cease-fire to rearm, then resume the war, Mr. Bondarev argued: “Only a total and clear defeat that is obvious to everyone will teach them.”

Mr. Bondarev makes a compelling point. It would be a disaster — both moral and strategic — if Mr. Putin were invited to talks before his major war objectives had been thwarted. Clear enough to a junior practitioner of international affairs, this wisdom seems to escape ostensibly more seasoned figures. Former U.S. secretary of state Henry A. Kissinger said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Western governments should push Ukraine into talks with Mr. Putin in the next 60 days, as well as support permanent Ukrainian territorial concessions, lest the conflict turn into a destabilizing “new war against Russia itself.” Similar thinking seems to be at work in Italy and Hungary, which are reportedly urging the European Union to advocate a cease-fire and peace talks at its summit next week. Our colleagues on the New York Times editorial board have called on President Biden to counsel Kyiv not to “chase after an illusory ‘win.’”

This remains a minority view within the Western alliance, and it should be. As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made clear at Davos: “Ukraine must win this war, and Putin’s aggression must be a strategic failure.” To be sure, the war is terribly costly — for the whole world. It must end as soon as reasonably possible. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated that he will talk with Mr. Putin — as soon as Russia withdraws to the prewar lines, under which it held Crimea and a swath of additional territory. Mr. Zelensky also insists, appropriately, that a false peace would be worse than useless and that premature talk of a settlement must not undercut Ukraine’s military efforts.

As Mr. Kissinger and others rightly note, Moscow has ample means to escalate the war — not least by using nuclear weapons. Yet what’s remarkable about the past three months of war is how little appetite Mr. Putin has actually shown for confrontation with the West. NATO’s red lines, public and private, seem to be holding. Nor does Mr. Putin show signs of interest in a deal such as the one Mr. Kissinger seems to assume he would accept, as opposed to the outright seizure of all Ukraine that Mr. Putin has repeatedly openly pursued.

Perhaps Ukraine’s counteroffensive will fail, and the military situation will eventually reach such an impasse that a negotiated settlement becomes inevitable. For now, though, the best way for Ukraine’s friends to help is to accelerate shipments of vital weaponry — and stop negotiating with themselves.",a08c184d47a1b2e59c805f082e457b9e8ccf5c12,True,False,,,,,0,1653687480,,0,{},ia8r5sw,True,t3_uz8hgt,False,True,t3_uz8hgt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz8hgt/washington_post_editorial_board_now_is_not_the/ia8r5sw/,1653687498,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653658680.0,

No. Because we live in countries that don't execute you for holding a non existant sign. We actually have more or less independent, fact checkable media.

History will judge you, but it's not too late to stand on it's right side. For once do something to pay for the suffering you are advocating for. Do something that you won't regret when everyone turns away from you. Be a human.

&gt; 
&gt; The other countries has already sent their weapons and they are already fighting.

You dont need as long to train on ""simple"" howitzers if you already have experience with those. The french Caesars were ready for delivery in french factories, thats why they could be send immediately - but also ""only"" 12.

&gt; And 7 cannons from one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the world? Seriously?

The largest weapons manufacturers in the world have delivery times of several years after placing your order. Its not like there are production lines spewing out tanks every other day - all european countries havent really been buying a lot the last 30 years for obvious reasons. If you have 3-10 years of time then im sure theres a fuckton which could be send.

Regarding the 7 cannons: Germany has like 100-120 with most of the ones in service being engaged in NATO duties in lithunia and elsewhere. If more could have been refurbished and spared in the current timeframe i'm sure it would have been done. The issue is that replacements for them will take atleast 30 months.

&gt; Germany has tanks.

Germany has a whole lot of 328 Leopards. As i said: Its not the US. Most of the cold war tanks have been sold to allies like greece or turkey or have been scrapped, just like the rest of europe did due to disarmament treaties and cost saving.

Regarding the Marders: It seems like a) there are issues with sending enough ammunition as switzerland is vetoing any export to ukraine and b) i'd guess they wont be send unless other western countries agree on doing the same. You may think its stupid, but germany is more or less sending the same as other allies and doesnt want to push the boundaries itself.",4625a88ba9dd004f9d320c8d5a65a3b52d27bee8,True,False,,,,,0,1653686762,,0,{},ia8pns3,False,t3_uz3fc9,False,True,t1_ia8ob6t,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3fc9/in_eastern_europe_the_image_of_the_ugly_german_is/ia8pns3/,1653686773,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653657962.0,

E.g.:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/uny6vm/a_heatmap_of_phones_connected_to_the_russian/

&gt; You don’t know their plans and neither do I.

Yet you make up idiotic excuses like ""Kyiv was a feint"". Why?

They tried really hard to move south from Izyum, and failed.

&gt; it looks like they’re doing what’s called “defeat in detail”

Then Strelkov would call you a moron, because Russia is rapidly losing men and military hardware, while achieving very little, and giving Ukraine time to gather more NATO tech.

&gt; we’ll know soon enough.

Whether Russia will manage to encircle that tiny city? And you'll consider that a huge victory? OMG...

Want a secret? A significant chunk of the most capable Ukrainian forces in that area is in Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Check out where they are, check out where the potential encirclement is, and explain why the encirclement completely misses those cities and will in fact be very exposed to attacks from them.

&gt; that’s going to be hard to swallow when achieve their stated military objective of “liberating” the DonBass.

""Liberating Donbas"" wasn't even the stated objective. ""Denazification"" (regime change) and ""demilitarization"" (eliminating the Ukrainian army) were. Now Russia is saying that the Ukrainian leadership stays, the Ukrainian army stays, ""just please give us Donbass"". Why did their appetite shrink so much?

Also, they're nowhere near ""liberating Donbas"". Look at the map of the Donetsk region. There's a lot of well-protected ground left to ccover.

&gt; Never wise to attribute incompetence when you don’t know the facts and we don’t.

If it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it's probably a duck. Why are you so motivated to always assume that Russia is competent and winning? Have there been situations in the past where the aggressor lost badly due to terrible miscalculation? Has Russia ever proven to be completely incompetent at war in the past? From the Voyage of the Damned, to losing almost its whole army and its capital to Hitler in 1941 while having an advantage over him in terms of tanks and planes, Russia always sucked.

&gt; the advice and opinion pieces saying it’s time for negotiations are signs that Russia is winning

Or that Russia likes to pay writers good money for promoting its agenda. Or that many people don't give a fuck about neither Russia nor Ukraine, and just want the war to end ASAP. There are lots of possible explanations, but you pick the one that favors Russia and also denies the observable facts (unlike the other explanations I mentioned). Why so?

Do you expect them to launch a full-scale retaliation strike in response to one nuke aimed at some mountain range? A full-scale retaliation would guarantee that there will be a radioactive wasteland in Russia's place.

Also, there's a chain of people that need to agree for the strike to happen. What if at least one of them is ok with that lone nuke flying towards Putin's bunker? What if many are?

Every nuclear-armed country has technically hypersonic nukes. Every ICBM's payload is hypersonic at the terminal phase, and very difficult to intercept.

Who told you that?

Remember how the Moskva, equipped with S-300, completely failed to intercept two subsonic missiles and sank? And the S-300 guarding Kyiv sometimes intercepts cruise missiles, but seems to miss at least half of the time. S-300 was supposed to be good. What makes you think that S-400 is any better?

946,[],False,,Pirateangel113,,,[],,,,text,t2_2x9cw7mh,False,False,I have to disagree Biden has been supplying arms and training Ukrainian forces since before the beginning of the war. One of the reasons why Ukraine is still a nation right now is because of that along with Biden rallying NATO against Russia since November when our intelligence agencies believed Russia would invade. Biden was making sure sanctions packages were ready and our allies were ready to act. I think Ukraine winning the battle of Kyiv was the turning point and signaled the Biden admin to start sending heavier weapons. One of the reasons we did not send heavier weapons was preventing IP falling into Russian hands.. as the Russians could reverse engineer said weapons and then eventually develop them on their own. The second main reason is that Ukraine is not trained to use said equipment. They would need to retrain their army in order to use said equipment during a full fledged war. The third reason (similar to the second) is training/developing the support networks and knowledge to maintain said equipment also during a full fledged war. The 4th reason U.S intelligence vastly overestimated Russia's military. The 5th reason Taking Putin's nuclear threat seriously but definitely one of the main reasons is that Putin gave a list of all the weapons that would start a nuclear war Jets were one of them. The slow approach  I think was a brilliant ploy to not start a nuclear war. Putin was the proverbial frog where by we slowly increased the lethality (if you increase the temperature of water when a frog is sitting in pot to quickly they will jump out of the water however if you slowly increase the temperature on a frog in boiling water it doesn't know he is being boiled to death and wont jump out of the water) of weapons sent to Ukraine in order to not start a nuclear war. I think the reasons listed above were all valid reasons as to not jump the gun and move to quickly on increasing lethality.,6da6c011334a30fd246c115a56f04a9e6563a519,True,False,,,,,0,1653684870,,0,{},ia8loj1,False,t3_uz57zi,False,True,t1_ia895ww,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz57zi/lindsey_graham_the_biden_administration_has_been/ia8loj1/,1653684888,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653656070.0,

The first being that Ukraine has a shared culture and background with Russia. The narrative that Ukraine does not have a unique identity is bogus since Ukrainian culture history can be traced back to Kievan Rus and Russian back to Moskva period, but they are ethnically, linguistically and culturally related and akin in many ways. 

Second is Crimea is more important to Russia geographically due to the warm water port, for shipping and trade, and because those surrounding waters are supposed to have large amounts of untapped oil reserves. Also historically land invasions into Russia came from the west, not the frozen North where Finland is.

Third is Russia couldnt conquer a gas station in Finland right now so they have no military options to stop Finland short of nuclear or cyber; nuclear would be disastrous and going with that option could realize the end of the current Russian establishment so no go. 

It is a good time for Finland and Sweden to try to get into NATO. Russia lacking military options is most likely going to go to have to try to undermine the process itself by going to Turkey, Hungary, etc and giving them some irrefutable offer; I can only speculate what it would be but it would likely involve things like giving Turkey support and free access to all the territories and objectives in Syria, Caucasus etc. Stuff Turkey cares about a whole lot more than whether Finland joins NATO or not.

I don't know about that ""permanent"" bit. A nation can always change their stripes and become more transparent, more friendly, shed its barbaric past and adopt a demeanor of camaraderie.

Ukraine itself used to be part of the USSR and now the US loves them. They don't have to be great democracies either, as Poland shows by being nearly a dictatorship.

Russia's best bet, when they lose, is to replace Putin and claim they're turning a new leaf, they'll play ball with others, and be more open to peace. That's my prediction of what will happen, at least.

You also don't seem to understand that not everyone pays equal tax and one of our biggest issues is currently the wealthy and corporations do not in any way pay their fair share of tax. Since you mentioned being on a 40% tax rate there have likely been years where you paid more in tax, total, than Amazon or Starbucks did in this country.

You also seem to be labouring under this impression that by stopping aid to Ukraine, or any other kind of foreign add, would magically make welfare and social programs well-funded. Again; these are being deliberately underfunded and sabotaged for political beliefs, not because of any actual realistic monetary or fiscal policy. It's like the Brexit Bus fallacy; that millions extra a week was always possible, but Tory policy is based on slashing public services and privatizing everything for the benefit of the wealthy few in order to enrich themselves even further. It's why when the Railways failed in the late 70's/80's and were privatized, the Tory ministers responsible for this switch all later on ended up with cushy jobs on the boards or as consultants to these private Rail companies. It wasn't a natural end point of a failing system, it was deliberate sabotage to deliberately enrich themselves and land a nice job after they left Parliament.

We haven't even spent £1 billion in aid to Ukraine so far, £1.3 in the future. That's a tiny drop of that 2.4 trillion you're panicking about. We have at least £10 billion ""missing"" in fraudulent PPE deals that all went to fake companies being run by stooges and friends of the Tory party though.

By having most of the Russian army concentrate around one city. So there's the most dense combat this war has seen so far. At least 1/3 of the Russian forces have been lost according to the British intelligence reports.

&gt; Russian troops are just 16 miles away from encircling Ukraine's elite special forces in a potential major victory for Vladimir Putin in the Donbas.

Just look at how their plans shifted. https://i.redd.it/bmatgf933qx81.png

If you pick a small enough target to encircle, you might even be 10 meters away from doing it. And there's nowhere near encircling the majority of Ukraine's forces in that region, because the majority of Ukraine's forces isn't within the circle.

Also, there's a lot of doubt that they will be able to pull this encirclement off. All of their previous plans failed.

&gt; You can’t conquer a country of 44mil with ~200K troops.

Precisely. Yet they tried hard to do that when they rushed in completely ignoring any logistics, with food only for 3 days. Because they are simply incompetent and misinformed.

&gt; The run to Kyiv was to surround the city and hopefully attain an intimidation surrender.

See the ""incompetent and misinformed"" part. Yes, that's what they tried to do. They were retarded enough to believe that this is a possibility. And that the rest of the country will accept the invaders if they manage to take control over Kyiv. Afghanistan would have been a walk in the part compared to what Russia would have got itself into - in the best case scenario. What's happening now is not the best case scenario for them.

&gt; However to assume the country that is the home of the best chess players in the world didn’t plan one move ahead is just silly.

There doesn't seem to have been a plan ""B"". Look around. Finland and Sweden are joining NATO, and prevention of NATO expansion was the main declared purpose of the war. Ukraine is rearming to NATO standards (""militarizing"") faster than ever, while Russia is rapidly losing military strength and, according to any analyst, is doomed in a war of attrition (as long as western weapons keep flowing). The Russian economy had a nuke go on top of it, with the foreign reserves frozen (likely to be confiscated) and most logistical chains broken. None of that was even remotely planned.

Most of their losses are due to artillery and he Ukrainians have used it intelligently.

That’s also the case with the huge losses in the river crossing, also the case with the assault on Kyiv, they totally bombarded the VDV with artillery.

Using anti tank missiles primarily was the idea of the west just supplying Ukraine for an “insurgency” not even thinking Ukraine would resist.

Using anti tank missiles is dangerous work, just look at the footage of the uk/us volunteers taking out the btr. That thing could have unleashed auto cannon on them and shredded them.

anti tank missiles are crucial for stopping armour just rolling over them and encircling them easily like ilovaisk and debaltseve hearts ago when all they had were hand aimed rpgs.

But you really need heavy artillery to inflict heavy losses on the attackers as they’re in their new  positions etc

Me as a Swede would really like to see that we sent all hardware we have to Ukraina but if the worst happened and the orcs deciedes to take Gotland from Kaliningrad and we're out of stock what then?

That being said I'd really would love seeing the store of outdated Leopard 2's (Strv 121) being sent to Ukraina if they are still serviceable.

And they can’t be right about this either, decimated armies can’t carry out maneuver warfare like this:

 “Russian troops are just 16 miles away from encircling Ukraine's elite special forces in a potential major victory for Vladimir Putin in the Donbas.”

Here’s what happened. Your cognitive dissonance will probably prevent you from believing it but I’m probably right.

You can’t conquer a country of 44mil with ~200K troops. This is not US/Iraq where the tech and Intel gap was massive, this is close to a peer level conflict. Additionally, unlike Iraq’s barren desserts, Ukraine with all their towns and villages and well entrenched positions is formidable. We had our hands full in Fallujah, there’s about 10 of those there but again this time the defenders have NATO equip and US Intel.

Conventional wisdom is that you want a 4-1, maybe 3-1 advantage when attacking but we were just told “Ukraine has 700,000 men now defending Ukraine” , vastly out numbering the attackers.

Knowing all of this, they planned a fast, maneuver based operation to try to get an early win. The run to Kyiv was to surround the city and hopefully attain an intimidation surrender. Russia wanted Zelensky and the Ukrainian government to remain intact so they could sign the surrender, legitimizing it. The world would never accept a puppet regime’s concessions but they would if Zelensky signed them. They never planned to storm Kyiv, they didn’t have anywhere near the numbers to take the city. 

Obviously this went horribly wrong for Russia, they wildly underestimated Ukraine’s defense and they were unable to even get into positions around the city so they retreated. However to assume the country that is the home of the best chess players in the world didn’t plan one move ahead is just silly. The move on Kyiv also fixed a large portion of the Ukrainian military away from the actual theater of operations. This allowed Russia to better prepare the battlefield in the south and East and we are seeing the benefits of that now.",bec78621f365aa3cc14330a751624011cc6aaaa8,True,False,,,,,0,1653681474,,0,{},ia8e9s9,False,t3_uyx72g,False,True,t1_ia88ily,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyx72g/the_russian_army_are_being_slowed_down_then_mowed/ia8e9s9/,1653681487,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653652674.0,

On Feb. 25, the priest of a rural parish located northeast of Moscow compared the campaign announced by Mr. Putin the previous morning to Hitler’s invasion of Poland in 1939. “Russian soldiers are killing their brothers and sisters in Christ,” Father Ioann Burdin wrote on the parish’s website. “We can’t shamefully cover our eyes and call black things white and evil good.”  
Father Burdin was charged with “discrediting Russia’s armed forces” in the online post and in a sermon he delivered to parishioners on March 6, according to court documents seen by The Wall Street Journal, and was later fined 35,000 rubles, or about $500.  
He is one of 273 Russian Orthodox Church priests who signed an antiwar appeal published on independent church portal Pravmir on March 1. Hundreds of Orthodox clergy and theologians globally have also penned an open letter denouncing Patriarch Kirill’s alignment with Mr. Putin on the invasion and his advocacy of the “Russian world” concept, describing it as “ethno-phyletist religious fundamentalism”—a form of religious nationalism.  
In Ukraine, after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and support of pro-Russian separatists, a breakaway Ukrainian Orthodox Church with some 7,000 parishes, around one-third of the total, secured autonomy from the Russian church. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the Istanbul-based patriarch seen as the global spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodoxy, overrode Moscow’s objections and granted it in 2019.  
Since the war began, Patriarch Bartholomew has sharply criticized Russia’s aggression. Pope Francis, meanwhile, said Patriarch Kirill “cannot become Putin’s altar boy” in an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper.  
In a March survey by Ukrainian polling agency Rating, 63% of respondents in Ukraine said the Orthodox church in Ukraine that remains aligned with Moscow should sever those ties. Many churches, while not formally breaking away, have announced they will no longer mention Patriarch Kirill’s name during Mass, which is traditional.  
Patriarch Kirill was born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in 1946. After he graduated from the Leningrad seminary in 1970, he rose in the church’s ranks and joined the foreign-relations department, a position that allowed him to take frequent trips abroad at a time when fellow Soviet citizens were banned from doing so.  
Evidence from Soviet-era files that emerged publicly in the 1990s suggests that Patriarch Kirill was a KGB agent with the code name “Mikhailov.” While he isn’t named directly, several documents refer to a “Mikhailov” who represented the Russian Orthodox Church at the Switzerland-based World Council of Churches, traveled to international church conferences and provided information to KGB handlers. That lines up with the biography of Patriarch Kirill, who was just 24 when he became the church’s representative to the WCC in 1971.  
“There’s absolutely no doubt that Kirill was an agent of the KGB,” said Felix Corley, a U.K.-based author who has researched KGB links to church leaders. By the late Soviet era, it was typical for senior leaders of the Orthodox Church and other faiths to work with the secret police, though the degree of collaboration varied, Mr. Corley said.  
Initially, Patriarch Kirill was seen as a reformer who showed few signs of toeing the government line and sought to clean up the church’s image as an institution tainted by ties to the KGB. He was fired from his position as rector of the Leningrad Theological Academy in 1984 and sent to provincial Smolensk for publicly opposing the Soviet war in Afghanistan and for spreading “Western influence” to students by teaching them translated texts by Western theologians, according to a biography published in the November 2016 edition of the Russian Orthodox Church’s official journal.  
In 1989 he was appointed as head of the church’s external relations department, a post that he occupied for 20 years.  
Upon becoming patriarch in 2009, he offered Mr. Putin his backing and began to champion the spread of Russia’s influence overseas. But he retained his status as a reformer in the traditionally arch-conservative institution, offering tepid support for a wave of protests against fraud-marred parliamentary elections in December 2011 by calling on authorities to listen to the protesters’ demands.  
That changed weeks later after a meeting with Mr. Putin and other religious leaders. Mr. Putin, who had become prime minister after serving as president from 2000 to 2008, was seeking a third term as president, fueling the protests.  
At the public meeting, the patriarch praised Mr. Putin for helping Russia recover from the economic collapse of the 1990s, and compared Mr. Putin’s rule to a “miracle from God.”  
Mr. Chapnin said the meeting had been set up by Mr. Putin’s administration to force the patriarch to clarify his allegiances in a public setting. “Putin showed Kirill that he can manipulate a situation in the way he wants, and with ease,” Mr. Chapnin said, citing conversations with people who helped organize the meeting.  
Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the meeting was indeed organized by the presidential administration but “no one forced anyone, that’s a lie.”  
In April 2012, Russian bloggers drew attention to a photo published on the Russian church’s website in July 2009 that appeared to show Patriarch Kirill wearing a $30,000 Swiss Breguet watch. Opposition figures ridiculed him.  
Patriarch Kirill said in an interview with a Russian journalist that he indeed owned a Breguet but had never worn it, and that the photos had been doctored.  
Mr. Chapnin said he believes the meeting with Mr. Putin and the watch scandal made Patriarch Kirill realize the precarity of his position and the danger of criticizing the state.  
After the end of Communist rule, the state passed laws allowing the Russian Orthodox Church to reclaim property that had been nationalized over the decades, and also sponsored a huge program of church construction throughout the country, with funds coming from state enterprises or foundations tied to the church.  
Under Patriarch Kirill, new churches devoted to the Federal Security Service, the Airborne Forces and the National Guard have been consecrated, along with the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces, where Patriarch Kirill delivered his militant message about the war in Ukraine.

The cathedral has floors paved with metal from melted down weapons seized from the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany’s armed forces, murals of battle scenes and annexes dedicated to the Russian military’s patron saints.  
Not long before opening, the church removed a mosaic featuring the likenesses of Russian leaders including Mr. Putin, who gave a speech flanked by Patriarch Kirill and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu at the building’s opening ceremony in June 2020. Mr. Putin’s spokesman said the president didn’t think he deserved such recognition.  
While Patriarch Kirill’s stance has rarely deviated from the Kremlin’s, before the Ukraine invasion he was careful not to make overtly political statements. After the sermon at the Armed Forces Cathedral in April, theologians noted that the patriarch had moved beyond backing the expansion of Russia’s global influence to publicly backing the war.  
“Many people expected him to change his attitude at least because of the war,” said Cyril Hovorun, a Ukrainian-born theologian and former adviser to Patriarch Kirill. “The shock was that he continued to be the way he was.”  
Mr. Hovorun said he resigned as an adviser to the patriarch in 2012 over his “Russian world” stance. “Those statements about the war…\[were\] addressed to one person: Putin,” he said. “And they said clearly: I will be with you until the end.”

Putin’s Powerful Orthodox Church Ally Helps Cement Russian Support for War  
As cracks begin to show in the state media narrative about the invasion of Ukraine, Patriarch Kirill has been unwavering in support, portraying it for millions of faithful as a holy struggle against the West  
Matthew LuxmooreMay 25, 2022 12:18 pm ET  
On a Sunday in early April, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church stood inside the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces outside Moscow and delivered a sermon endorsing President Vladimir Putin’s war. It was the same day Western leaders decried reports of a massacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha by Russian forces.  
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Patriarch Kirill, a crucial ally of Mr. Putin, has placed the moral authority of the Russian Orthodox Church squarely behind the president, giving him critical backing in a country where 63% of the population identifies as Orthodox.  
In sermons broadcast on dedicated Orthodox TV channels and YouTube, the 75-year-old patriarch, who has led the church since 2009, has portrayed the war as a holy struggle against the West to preserve what he calls the russky mir—Russian world—uniting East Slavic lands including Ukraine under Moscow’s spiritual and political fold. The concept, which the patriarch has espoused with particular fervor since 2012, is an undercurrent to much of Mr. Putin’s rhetoric.  
Under Patriarch Kirill, the Russian Orthodox Church has become a primary purveyor of the president’s nationalist ideas. Sergey Chapnin, who formerly worked with Patriarch Kirill as the editor of the church’s monthly magazine and is now a critic, said it is as much a part of the regime as state television and major Russian corporations such as oil giant Gazprom.  
High-ranking priests are “part of the corrupt Putinist elite,” he said. “It’s terrible to see how this union with the state has made the church pliant and amoral.”  
Patriarch Kirill’s support could be a crucial legitimating factor for Mr. Putin as the army he ordered into Ukraine stalls in its campaign to seize territory and thousands of its soldiers die there, causing cracks in the carefully constructed TV narrative about Russian military might that has ensured broad popular backing for the war at home.  
Outside of Russia, the patriarch’s loyalty to Mr. Putin has aggravated splits in the broader Eastern Orthodox community of some 220 million faithful. In the face of criticism, he has doubled down. Returning to the Armed Forces Cathedral on May 8, he gave another sermon dismissing as nonsense the accusations that his speeches are militaristic and calling on Russians to “consolidate all our forces, spiritual and material, so that no one dares encroach upon the holy borders of our fatherland.”  
European Union officials said this month that the bloc is considering sanctions on Patriarch Kirill, including a potential asset freeze and travel ban, for his role as a leading advocate of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  
Vladimir Legoida, Patriarch Kirill’s spokesman, rejected charges that the church had become excessively politicized. “We hear this regularly and it’s connected purely to the fact that our critics are unhappy that the church has not become an instrument in the hands of the \[political\] opposition,” he said in written comments. The church’s cooperation with the state, he said, reflects demands from society.  
In March, the patriarch bestowed a revered relic of the Virgin Mary on the director of Russia’s National Guard, a general who had been sanctioned by both Europe and the U.S., saying he hoped it would inspire young soldiers to defend the fatherland. In one recent speech, he accused the West of threatening genocide against countries that refuse to allow gay parades or endorse liberal values, echoing sentiments voiced by Mr. Putin.  
During the Orthodox Easter on April 24, Mr. Putin attended Mass presided over by Patriarch Kirill at Moscow’s Christ the Savior Cathedral. As part of his annual Easter message, the president personally thanked the church leader for “developing fruitful cooperation with the state” and “taking care to strengthen unity and mutual understanding between people.”  
Born Vladimir Gundyaev, Patriarch Kirill is widely believed by many church historians to be a former agent of the KGB, where the president himself served. Mr. Legoida dismissed the allegations as false.  
Under the patriarch, the church has backed Mr. Putin’s push to regain influence over territories Moscow controlled during the Soviet era, including the Crimean Peninsula annexed from Ukraine in 2014 and parts of eastern Ukraine taken over by Russia-backed separatists the same year.  
Russian Orthodox priests routinely give pro-Kremlin sermons on the airwaves of Orthodox TV channels. In one recent appearance on the Tsargrad channel, Ukraine-born Father Andrei Tkachev equated opposition to military conflict with a desire to topple the Russian state. “Pacifism is more dangerous than war,” he said.  
An April survey by state-backed pollster FOM found that 66% of Russians trust the Orthodox Church and 54% trust Patriarch Kirill personally. Surveys show more than half of the population backs what Mr. Putin calls his “special military operation” in Ukraine.  
In Ukraine, almost two-thirds of Orthodox churches are still formally aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, which traces its origins to a 10th-century mass conversion in Kyiv known as the Baptism of Rus.  
Before the war, the institution helped maintain Moscow’s broader influence in Ukraine, through conferences, personal visits by Patriarch Kirill and a concerted social-media campaign about a single, unified Russian Orthodox Church spanning the region.  
Mr. Legoida, the patriarch’s spokesman, said the patriarch had long appealed to both Ukrainians and Russians to try to bring them together. “We witnessed these divisions over the past eight years and all those years the church urged reconciliation,” he said. “Unfortunately it wasn’t listened to.”  
Intense debate over the church’s backing of the war has broken out in Russia and in the wider Eastern Orthodox community, the world’s second-biggest group of Christians after the Roman Catholic Church.

1431,[],False,,tomispev,,,[],,,,text,t2_x73qn,False,False,"&gt;Russia is not the only polyglot nation that has failed to address its legacy of colonization. China currently oversees the largest concentration-camp system the world has seen since the Holocaust, dedicated to eliminating Uyghurs as a distinct nation. And much of the U.S. still refuses to view its own history as one of rote imperial conquest, from the Founding Fathers seizing Indigenous lands to the ongoing colonial status of places such as Puerto Rico.  
But it’s Russia—and, more specifically, Russian imperialism—that presents the most urgent threat to international security. Now the bill of allowing Moscow to retain its empire, without any reckoning with its colonial history, is coming due.  
Decolonizing Russia wouldn’t necessarily require fully dismantling it, as Cheney proposed. The push toward decolonization could instead focus on making the kind of democratic federalism promised in Russia’s constitution more than a hollow promise. This would mean ensuring that all Russian citizens, regardless of region, would finally be given a voice in choosing their leaders. Even simply acknowledging Russia’s colonial past—and present—would make some difference. “As much as decolonizing Russia is important for the territories it formerly occupied, reprocessing its history is also key for the survival of Russia within its current boundaries,” the scholars Botakoz Kassymbekova and Erica Marat recently wrote.  
Until Moscow’s empire is toppled, though, the region—and the world—will not be safe. Nor will Russia. Europe will remain unstable, and Ukrainians and Russians and all of the colonized peoples forced to fight for the Kremlin will continue to die. “There is no way for Russia to move forward with Putin and there is no way for Russia to move forward without addressing its imperial past and present,” the analyst Anton Barbashin recently tweeted. “Give up empire and attempt to thrive or hold \[on\] to it and continue degrading.”

&gt;  
&gt;*To avoid more senseless bloodshed, the Kremlin must lose what empire it still retains.*  
&gt;  
&gt;By Casey Michel  
&gt;  
&gt;The former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski once said that without Ukraine, Russia would cease to be an empire. It’s a pithy statement, but it’s not true. Even if Vladimir Putin fails to wrest back Ukraine, his country will remain a haphazard amalgamation of regions and nations with hugely varied histories, cultures, and languages. The Kremlin will continue ruling over colonial holdings in places including Chechnya, Tatarstan, Siberia, and the Arctic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia’s history is one of almost ceaseless expansion and colonization, and Russia is the last European empire that has resisted even basic decolonization efforts, such as granting subject populations autonomy and a meaningful voice in choosing the country’s leaders. And as we’ve seen in Ukraine, Russia is willing to resort to war to reconquer regions it views as its rightful possessions.  
&gt;  
&gt;During and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Russian empire hit its modern nadir, the United States refused to safeguard the newly won independence of multiple post-Soviet states, citing misplaced concerns about humiliating Moscow. Emboldened by the West’s reluctance, Moscow began to reclaim the lands it lost. Now Russia’s revanchism—aided by our inaction and broader ignorance of the history of Russian imperialism—has revived the possibility of nuclear conflict and instigated the worst security crisis the world has seen in decades. Once Ukraine staves off Russia’s attempt to recolonize it, the West must support full freedom for Russia’s imperial subjects.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. had an opportunity to unwind the Russian empire before. In September 1991, as the Soviet Union was falling apart, President George H. W. Bush convened his National Security Council. In the lead-up to the meeting, the White House seemed unsure how to handle the splintering superpower. Some of Bush’s closest advisers even called for trying to keep the Soviet Union together.  
&gt;  
&gt;Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was not one of them. “We could get an authoritarian regime \[in Russia\] still,” he warned during the meeting. “I am concerned that a year or so from now, if it all goes sour, how we can answer that we did not do more.” His end goal was clear: as Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates later wrote, Cheney “wanted to see the dismantlement not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian empire but of Russia itself, so it could never again be a threat to the rest of the world.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bush demurred. Rather than accelerate the Soviet disintegration, he tried to avoid antagonizing Moscow, even as President Boris Yeltsin’s administration began pushing the anti-Ukrainian animus that Putin now embodies. For years—as Russia stabilized and eventually prospered, and as Cheney masterminded some of the most disastrous American foreign-policy decisions in recent decades—many believed that Bush had selected the better strategy. Armageddon, as one historian phrased it, was averted.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2022, as Putin tries to restore the Russian empire by littering corpses across Ukraine, Bush’s position appears myopic. He—and American policy makers after him—failed to see the end of the Soviet Union for what it was: not just a defeat for communism, but a defeat for colonialism. Rather than quash Russia’s imperial aspirations when they had the chance, Bush and his successors simply watched and hoped for the best. As Bush’s National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft later said about the Soviet collapse, “In the end, we took no position at all. We simply let things happen.”  
&gt;  
&gt;We no longer have that luxury. The West must complete the project that began in 1991. It must seek to fully decolonize Russia.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many of Russia’s former colonies, including places such as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Armenia, succeeded in achieving and sustaining independence after the fall of the U.S.S.R. But only Ukraine’s independence has become an obsession for Putin. It’s not hard to see why. Stiff-arming Russia at every turn, Ukraine emerged as the biggest hurdle to the Kremlin’s efforts to reconsolidate its empire and undo the independence movements of the early 1990s.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not every one of the Kremlin’s colonies was so successful in achieving independence in those years. Scores of nations—“autonomous republics” in Russian parlance—never escaped the Kremlin’s control. For many, the process of decolonization made it only halfway.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chechnya, for instance, endured multiple horrific wars after declaring independence in the early ’90s. Yet when Chechen leadership turned to the West for aid, U.S. officials looked the other way. Many across the West remained blinded by the “saltwater fallacy,” which posits that colonies can be held only in distant, overseas territories. Instead of viewing places such as Chechnya as nations colonized by a dictatorship in Moscow, Western officials simply saw them as extensions of Russia proper. So rather than recognize the Chechens’ struggle as part of the global push toward decolonization, American President Bill Clinton compared them to the Confederacy and backed Yeltsin despite his brutality. Clinton’s position not only effectively sanctioned the horrors unleashed on innocent Chechens, but it showed Putin, then a rising bureaucrat, that Russian force would go unchallenged by the West. As former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar said, Western pressure could have prevented the violence in Chechnya. Analysts agree. Yet Washington twiddled its thumbs, and Grozny was flattened.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chechnya’s story is one of many. Nation after nation—Karelia, Komi, Sakha, Bashkortostan, Chuvashia, Kalmykia, Udmurtia, and many more—claimed sovereignty as the Soviet empire crumbled around them. Even regions that had been colonized by the Kremlin for centuries pushed for independence. In a 1992 referendum in Tatarstan, nearly two-thirds of the population voted in favor of sovereignty, even though Soviet authorities had drawn the republic’s borders to exclude some 75 percent of the Tatar population. As election observers wrote, the republic was motivated by “years of pent-up resentment” against Russian colonialism, and saw “huge support” for the referendum in ethnically Tatar regions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of propping up these emergent nations, the U.S. prioritized stability. Washington feared that any volatility in the region might cause Russia’s nuclear and biological weapons to fall into the wrong hands. Administration after administration made the same mistake. In his “Chicken Kiev” speech, George H. W. Bush warned Ukrainian separatists against “suicidal nationalism” (which Ukrainian separatists promptly ignored). Bill Clinton kept up his buddies-and-belly-laughs relationship with Yeltsin while Russian forces slaughtered Chechens en masse. George W. Bush took a hands-off approach to the entrenchment of Putin’s regime, even as Russian forces steamrolled into Georgia. Barack Obama’s blinkered “reset” policy set the stage for Putin’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump fawned over Putin and subordinated Ukraine’s interests to his pursuit of domestic political gain.  
&gt;  
&gt;The result: Chechnya remains dominated by a Kremlin-appointed despot. Tatarstan saw any pretense of sovereignty snuffed out by Putin. On and on Moscow marched, reclaiming nations desperate to escape its embrace. In Ukraine, we see the same story. Moscow is unlikely to stop there.",21cc699b6ae10db5eaa4b5249dd8a15635685426,True,False,,,,,0,1653679108,,0,{},ia890d2,True,t3_uz5eny,False,True,t3_uz5eny,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz5eny/as_the_west_searches_for_a_new_strategy_with/ia890d2/,1653679124,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653650308.0,

Artillery and air defense are normally fairly behind the line of contact, you do not know what hit you. So a lot of countries are comparatively generous with modern artillery.

MBTs and IFVs are direct contact vehicles, they will roll towards the Russians in case of an Ukrainian counteroffensive and the Russians will have them in their vehicle identification cards as NATO. The Ukrainians would indeed look like Cold War NATO and in case of success ... ""overrun by NATO"". So direct contact vehicles with high recognizability are not provided.

So far the Netherlands are in the lead here, they have provided their YPR-765 IFVs (variant of mostly harmless M113, which everyone has), although I do not know if that was the more heavily armed variants. The Marders would be immediately identified as German, no one else had them.

But holding them back is definitely costing Ukrainian lives, they are far more survivable then the BMP-1P Ukraine typically fields.

That being said, they went to a hell of a war zone that is unlike anything they have seen before. Therein, and despite any combat experience in other countries they are now exposed to something totally different. I went there a couple years ago and found the experience a real wake up and realized that I had not yet fully experienced war until I was in Ukraine. Not denigrating fellow veterans of the many recent wars. Yet there is a distinct realization that one feels when fighting on the side that is outgunned, lacking logistics and basic supplies, without dominant air support, that does not have the ability to integrate combined arms teams or even medics where needed, a place that many troops find bravdo to be superior to training and planning, where improvisation is everyday and all the time, and operations are fast and loose in comparison in NATO armies the areas of command, control, coordination, and communication. Fighting is sporadic and fierce. UXO is scattered in a mix of unmarked mines and traps. Fires burn until they extinguish themselves. Human waste - poop. It’s not talked about, but is everywhere due to breakdowns of systems that have been shelled. All the while getting the absolute shit shelled out of you for hours everyday after scrambling to the next basement or hole you can get in.

Reporters and universities from Australia, Europe, and the U.S. would randomly find me and ask me about nazis and I would explain to them that is not what is happening, but their ears were deaf. I suppose they may have a different opinion now. Moreover, the folks allegedly complaining may be hitting their heads on the same problems of bills stacking up and fighting falsehoods.

There are simply mistakes people have made looking at the conflict. If you take tanks as an example, the T-90M is much better than the old T-72 and probably most if not all Ukrainian tanks, but you're not going to see it completely turn the battlefield around. It being better doesn't mean it's a force multiplier either. It's still a tank with vulnerabilities and a gun that shoots at things.  


The same goes for tactics. Russians went in for the wrong war, and paid a heavy price for it. It's not that their elite forces were bad, but if you're airdropped against heavier forces and don't get any ground support, you're going to get shredded all the same. It doesn't mean Russians are eternally going to be useless and dumb, they've already adapted and are doing a decent job now, it's just that they weren't going to win just because they're elite forces either.  


Finally there's the numbers. People really have been unable to grasp that Russia was a declining power before that, with the numbers of active equipment converging towards something much smaller.

With T and S (C) it makes no actual difference. Yes, if you enunciate them very carefully, you can hear a very subtle difference, but in actual speech, you wouldn't really hear it. Under the ""hearing the difference"" part of the video, the palatalized version for the first word (MAT) is no real difference in pronunciation when you take into account the real world range of regular people's speech. In the second one, it palatalizes the vowel, not the previous consonant. For the third one there is a difference in the T, but the Tb sound is more like TS and doesn't sound like the Tb in the first one. The 4th one had a ""super subtle difference"" that is so subtle it might as well not be one. And the last one the b again palatalizes the vowel, not the preceding consonant. 

For me, letters like S, L, and T are already using the palate, so the words don't really sound different, except when the vowel is actually the letter being modified.

Between 1943 and 1945, members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army first massacred thousands of Poles throughout Wołyń, a region that was in Nazi-occupied Poland and is part of present-day Ukraine. Ukrainian nationalists went on, between 1943 and 1945, to kill an estimated 100,000 Poles. As part of retaliatory actions, Poles killed between 15,000 and 20,000 Ukrainians. Ukrainian nationalists wiped out 99 Polish towns and villages in Wołyń. 
To this day, Ukraine has refused to let Poland dig out the massive graves of Poles still untouched on Ukrainian ground, for fear of a resurgence of hatred and revenge. 


What happened?


Ukrainian Nazi leader Stephan Bandera, still the most celebrated hero in Ukraine today, had decided to purge all non-Ukrainians from a future Ukrainian state. He wanted not only to purge Polish civilians, but also to erase all traces of Polish presence in the area. Murders were committed with incredible cruelty. Many were burnt alive or thrown into wells. Axes, pitchforks, scythes, knives and other farming tools rather than guns were used in an attempt to make the massacres look like a spontaneous peasant uprising.
In the blood frenzy, the Ukrainians tortured their victims with unimaginable bestiality. Victims were scalped. They had their noses, lips and ears cut off. They had their eyes gouged out and hands cut off and they had their heads squashed in clamps. Woman had their breasts cut off and pregnant woman were stabbed in the belly. Men had their genitals sliced off with sickles.

Nazi ideology is one that has led to the worst behavior in humankind. It isn't the only one. Communism is another. Democracy is another. Monarchy another. Revolutions of any type, another -- history has shown us that any strong belief that a certain system is a superior form of government which must be promoted around the world, given its superiority, leads to inhuman wars eventually, since it has to eliminate its enemies in order to survive and prevail.",0afad5b2d4cec3358301dd1f71ebda0e02f8ddec,True,False,,,,,0,1653676649,,0,{},ia83gks,False,t3_usgn1i,False,True,t1_i96nynb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/usgn1i/some_try_to_shift_the_blame_for_russian_invasion/ia83gks/,1653676664,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653647849.0,

&gt;[MURMANSK, Russia (AP)](https://apnews.com/article/9e132f2f5db7d72963277606ddab6622) _ A woman whose son was killed when a Russian nuclear submarine sank has denied that she was forcibly sedated when she criticized a top official over the government’s bungled attempts to rescue the crew.

&gt;Video images broadcast around the world showed Nadezhda Tylik crying and shouting at First Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov when he met with relatives of the crew shortly after the Kursk submarine sank Aug. 12. When Tylik resisted sitting down, a woman was seen standing behind her with a syringe.

&gt;Some media reports suggested that Tylik was sedated forcibly to shut her up when her attack on Klebanov got too heated. The incident was portrayed by some critics as a throwback to the Soviet era, when dissent was sometimes suppressed with forced medical treatment.

&gt;But Tylik, whose 25-year-old son Sergei was among the 118 sailors killed aboard the Kursk, dismissed the reports as ``a lie.″ She said Saturday that she was injected with medication she regularly took for a heart problem.

&gt;”Nobody gave me any tranquilizers, as those people have been writing,″ Tylik said in a telephone interview from Vidyayevo, where the Kursk was based and relatives have gathered since the tragedy. ``I don’t want such reports to be circulated; they don’t give such injections here.″

&gt;Tylik said the injection was made on her doctor’s recommendation and at the request of her husband, who was by her side throughout the meeting with Klebanov.

&gt;She said that after being given the injection, she had some hot tea and returned to the meeting room five minutes later to listen to the rest of Klebanov’s remarks.

With the help of these materials, we know for sure where they have what problem facilities, in particular, those related to the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. It's about nuclear weapons. We know where they (in Russia) have their arsenals of nuclear weapons, where they have storages of nuclear warheads for nuclear submarines hidden in the rocks. We are aware of a mass of violations, both corruption and technological, related to the construction of warhead storage bases, including about Gadzhiyevo (a base for the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation, a base for nuclear submarines), about Olenegorsk (a city near the aviation base of the Russian Navy on the Kola peninsula), about Severomorsk (base point of the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation). 



We have not yet studied even 10% of the amount of information we received. This is a huge amount. But even now we are well aware that a huge number of violations are documented in all these technological chains and purchases. We did not look inside these nuclear warheads, but taking into account the fact that everything there is completely built on corruption, on kickbacks, on the principle of loyalty, non-professionalism, that is, there is reason to believe that most of this is low-quality products. At best, it will break on the way to the goal of the path, and at worst, it will not fly or fly in the wrong direction at all. So this is a really big problem. 


They also show successful launches of the Bulava (*ballistic missiles of the D-30 complex, placed on submarines*), for example. But they always show this not online, but after the launch. And they show only good launches. And the unsuccessful, of course, remain behind the scenes, and they have much more of them.

**How reliable are these records?**

100% sure of them. We have verified them. Somewhere in criminal cases they found confirmation, somewhere in cases of operational accounting.

**The concentration camps for Ukrainian prisoners of war in the pre-trial detention center of the Federal Penitentiary Service. Do you have video or audio evidence to support this?**


No, for this part we only have information from employees who are seconded there. They reported that entire institutions of the Federal Penitentiary Service were disbanded, cleared of Russian prisoners, grouped and compacted somewhere. And in a number of institutions, their employees switched to working as military concentration camps for the maintenance of Ukrainian prisoners of war. There, in addition to the personnel of the institution of the Federal Penitentiary Service, there are seconded soldiers of special forces from different regions. They do cross trips. For what? So that these special forces, which are just the most cruel, do not do something in their region, but travel around different regions to such concentration camps. This is done so that later it would be impossible to understand who these people in masks were, who were committing tortures and crimes.

That is, then the victim will testify, but it will be impossible to establish who committed the violence. For example, there was a man in the pre-trial detention center in Voronezh, where he was beaten and tortured by people in masks. And it will be impossible to prove that this was the work of the Voronezh special forces, because officially on this particular day, it turns out that the Voronezh special forces were somewhere else.

Another such detail. In the rooms of long visits in many institutions, operatives of the FSB of Russia now live, 4-7 people each. These are brigades that manage and control the actions of special forces and the actions of personnel. And the FSB officers, in turn, have two functions: the first is the suppression of the will, so that everyone obeys and behaves well, and the second is the maximum recruitment in order to persuade prisoners to complicity in the so-called Nuremberg trials of neo-Nazis and Bandera. They want to make an analogue of it now. That is, they want to present to the whole world some “terrible crimes” allegedly by neo-Nazis. 

Here they are working on this topic. Somewhere they put physical and moral pressure on someone, somewhere simply in exchange for preferential conditions of detention and some indulgences are sought, so that a person obeys and signs the testimony necessary for the investigative department of the Investigative Committee of Russia. If Europe has not yet organized some kind of court for war crimes committed by Russia, then Russia wants to launch such a process ahead of Europe. The Russian government wants to organize some kind of big process. Their task is purposeful, to link all “crimes” with the West, with supposedly instructors from the CIA who were in Ukraine from the US Department of Defense and from British services. The goal is to show that everything that was going on in Ukraine was not just some Banderites themselves, it was the CIA officers who specially made them that way over 10 years of work. They have a script that they follow. From the mass of prisoners they filter out those whom they want to leave for this ""big tribunal"".

**What terms of the “grand tribunal” are we talking about?**

Their task is to launch this process by the end of the year.

**How many Ukrainian prisoners who are kept in pre-trial detention centers, in the so-called concentration camps, are we talking about?**

We reliably know about more than 10 institutions of the Federal Penitentiary Service. According to unconfirmed reports, we can talk about dozens of such institutions. We are talking about thousands of prisoners of war. We don't know the exact number yet.


**”Inhuman methods of interrogation are applied to prisoners of war”—Is it possible to say that such torture, which is on the videos you have, will also be in concentration camps where Ukrainian prisoners of war are kept?**

We have reasonable suspicions to think so. We know that a number of “kapo” developers (prisoners appointed by the colony authorities to supervise the work of other prisoners in the colony) from Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk and other “torture” regions were sent to the border with Ukraine. These are those ""capos"" developers who have a long prison term, who beat, torture, rape and kill people. They are secret agents, they are on contract with the main operational department of the Federal Penitentiary Service, and with the “M” department of the FSB of Russia. Accordingly, they can be used for various kinds of torture, breaking, forcing people to testify or to kill. It is no coincidence that they were sent from Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, Kirov and Omsk to Rostov and, in my opinion, to Belgorod. Just the last two cities are located near the border with Ukraine. There is every reason to believe that they were sent there for a reason, namely for them to be engaged in in-camera development. On what scale it goes, one can only guess ... I reasonably suspect that now inhuman methods of interrogation are being applied to a number of prisoners of war. Especially now. My source said that now they are especially rubbing their hands, knowing full well that members of the Azov battalion will be brought to them in order to break them, and so that some of them, and this is according to statistics 20-30%, how they are expressed, “split”, caved in and began to testify about what kind of “Nazis” and “Bendera” they were. that now inhuman methods of interrogation are being applied to a number of prisoners of war.

Here is an image of captured Russian tank ammo. 3BM-26 Nadezhda and 9M119M Invar is clearly visible. The 9M119M is only used in Russia as the Ukrainian autoloaders can not fire the Invar. 


Russia does fire 3BM-26 in  live fire exercises. But the fact is that Ukrainian soldiers caught the round. Unless you substantiate your argument. 

&gt;That's not accurate, and we seen nothing to suggest that.

What's not accurate? That T-80BV's from the 1980's don't have thermal imaging? They don't. The Soviet Union developed a specific prototype with thermal imaging. But it was deemed too expensive. Same thing with the T-80U. First Russian tank to be standardized with thermal sights is the T-90. 

&gt;T-64BV and T-80BV is no way close to being identical.
There's quite alot of differences, so the sheer fact that you would say this, has me questioning your validity.


Identical may have been an exaggeration. The armour lay-out is different. But not so much as to make them leagues of their own. A T-80BV is still capable of being knocked out frontally by 3BM-42 from similar ranges as the T-64BV. The true difference in the T-80BV's protection were against shaped charge ammunition.

1977,[],False,,PanEuropeanism,,,[],,,,text,t2_84oo4ons,False,True,"Without long-term strategies, politicians become prisoners of events. One of these prisoners is called Olaf Scholz. The event that is driving him forward is the Ukraine war. That the German chancellor doesn't want to travel to Kiev - forget it. That the Federal Republic of Germany initially only wanted to supply Ukraine with 5,000 pointed hats - forget it. What really matters is something else: the German government doesn't know how to use the conflict for its own political interests. That's why Germany will lose out to countries that have a strategy.

Joe Biden may be senile, but he clearly has an idea of what he wants to achieve with the war. America hopes that by supplying massive quantities of weapons to Ukraine it will weaken Russia to such an extent that it falls decisively behind in the geopolitical competition.

Moscow is no longer supposed to pose a threat, so Washington reworks Putin's invasion of Ukraine into a proxy war. The Ukrainians fight, the Americans are not a direct party to the war and thus limit the risk of escalation. But they still reap the benefits.

This constellation is a classic pattern in Russian-American relations. The Soviet Union equipped North Vietnam with weapons and thus made a significant contribution to the American defeat in Vietnam. The US returned the favor by helping the Afghan mujahedin fight the Soviet Union.

It is in the logic of this confrontation that one hopes to draw the adversary into as protracted and costly a war of attrition as possible. The adversary is expected to wear out. A quick ceasefire and the reduction of suffering are secondary in this geopolitical calculation.

Emmanuel Macron at least knows what he doesn't want. In the old French tradition, he wants to preserve the character of the EU as an essentially Western European union in order to cement French supremacy in Europe. He is sceptical about the membership applications of the Balkan countries and Ukraine because this would shift the EU's centre of gravity eastwards.

Macron fears the weakening of France and is actively working against it. To this end he floated the idea of a Brussels limbo in which the accession candidates can stew until doomsday. He calls this a ""European political community"" to complement the European Union. That sounds sympathetic and sufficiently vague, but the real goal is obvious.

But what does Germany want? Olaf Scholz is getting bogged down in trivialities, in a feud with the Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin, for example, or in a debate about where the ammunition for the Gepard tank intended as arms aid to Kiev should come from.

All of this seems infinitely petty. Like Biden, Scholz doesn't see the strategic gain that the war promises. But neither does he, like Macron, take a spirited approach to the risks that exist from a national perspective. Instead the traffic light coalition is driven by the superficialities of the day, by open letters from German intellectuals, for example, which won't change the course and outcome of the war one iota.

For all its gloom, there is a deeper reason for this attitude. The chancellor and his party do not wish Putin victory, of course. They have also realised that Germany cannot permanently resist the EU Commission's insistence that it boycott oil and gas from Russia. But secretly the Social Democrats are mourning the comfortable times when Moscow reliably supplied energy and every government could gain a domestic political advantage by saving on the Bundeswehr.

A bit of free pacifism always goes as long as the US and Nato guarantee security. With this attitude, politicians of all parties were implementing the wishes of the popular majority. Many people in Germany - and also in Switzerland - have hung a sign outside their door saying ""Do not disturb"". They want to be left alone from the impositions of world politics. Putin, the troublemaker, reminds us that this was an illusion.

It takes a long time to overcome bad habits. The package of 100 billion euros for the ""change of times"" was supposed to be used to remedy the worst abuses in the German armed forces so that everything could stay the way it was. Just don't commit: talk to Putin, talk to Selenski too, don't deliver any weapons - and above all don't do anything that could endanger the idea of the moral superiority of German foreign policy. But Scholz overlooked how fundamental the change triggered by the war is.

Within the West, roles are being redistributed. The United States, which had recently come across as egotistical, isolationist, and paralyzed by domestic political polarization, has reestablished its claim to leadership. Whether this is more than a snapshot remains to be seen, but the moment counts too.

Britain had catapulted itself out of the EU with Brexit. By taking the Ukrainian side even before the war began and supporting it with weapons and military advisors, it is now underlining how indispensable it is for European security.

Boris Johnson may be a hooligan, but once again he proved his political instincts. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also saw her chance. She frees herself somewhat from the paternalism of Paris and Berlin by being omnipresent. She travelled to Kiev, she is pushing for the energy boycott.

Germany, on the other hand, seems despondent and at a loss. Unlike von der Leyen, Scholz can't even utter the simple sentence that Ukraine should win the war. By saying that Russia must not win he leaves room for speculation. Does the German government want Ukraine to be divided?

In the euro crisis Berlin was still calling the shots and ultimately decided Greece's fate. Now thanks to its size and economic power the Federal Republic can put the brakes on developments in the EU, but it doesn't shape them.

On the contrary: Germany has suffered a considerable loss of confidence in Eastern Europe as a result of its clumsy Ukraine policy. The image of the ugly German is back. The anti-German resentment is understandable and yet irrational, because the Eastern Europeans need Germany's support in the EU. So both sides lose.

Yet the current shift in weight in the EU towards the East gives Berlin plenty of options. Germany was always safe when stable conditions prevailed in Eastern Europe. That's why Chancellor Kohl still advocated a rapid eastward expansion of the EU and NATO. Since then the ""wild east"" no longer begins at the Oder but at the Bug.

Such strategic foresight is passé. Everyone knows that Ukraine must first fulfil numerous criteria before it can be admitted. But a clear prospect of accession would help extend the zone of stability eastwards. As long as Moscow is absorbed by the war, this would be the best opportunity to create facts.

Scholz, on the other hand, preferred to go along with Macron's initiative. The idea of creating a new organisation for the inferior brothers to the east and south already suffered a shipwreck once with the ""privileged partnership"" for Turkey. Only a French president is capable of draping a failed proposal so deftly that it is not laughed at. For Macron the charade has served its purpose for the time being.

For Berlin, on the other hand, the stakes in the East have been raised yet again compared to the 1990s. German industry has chosen Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia as its extended workbench. The longer the war lasts, the more bitter the fighting, the greater the risk that the eastern members of the EU will be destabilised. It would therefore be in Germany's interest to protect its own investments in the East. For this, however, a strategy is needed.",8ca53eca8b7deb9a62505bae9e32c7703a60d60d,True,False,,,,,0,1653672911,,0,{},ia7ustp,True,t3_uz3fc9,False,True,t3_uz3fc9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3fc9/in_eastern_europe_the_image_of_the_ugly_german_is/ia7ustp/,1653672931,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653644111.0,

- Early 2021 - Trump gets briefing from the CIA on intercepted Russian war plans.  Daydreams about fast food and Ivanka in a bathing suit instead of paying attention.  Leaves halfway through the meeting, mumbling something about ""not enough pictures"".

- Mid 2021 - Top Secret communications from the British, German and French intelligence services, asking for America to share any data or analysis about ""strange Russian military actions"" land on the Resolute Desk.  Trump attempts to flush them all down the Oval Office toilet at the same time and clogs the West Wing's plumbing for the 8th time in a month.

- November 2021 - Russia's military massing on the border with Ukraine sets off alarm bells and NATO demands a meeting with Trump to discuss a coordinated response.  Trump calls Putin, and is thoroughly convinced this is just a training exercise within 2 minutes. Trump reminds Putin that he's still waiting for the promised dirt on Pelosi and Schumer.

- December 2021 - Trump leaves NATO leaders stunned for the 100th time by stating that ""..even if this wasn't a training exercise, which Putin personally assured me it is, I've been told by some very smart people that Russia doesn't have enough ships to sail their whole army to Ukraine.""  Before anyone can explain that Russia and Ukraine share a land border, Trump shoves his way to the front of the group for a photo op, then slouch-ily walks out.

- Feb 24, 2022 - Upon hearing the news of the Russian invasion while golfing, Trump shrugs and says ""Too bad Zelensky didn't want to help me when I needed a favor...""",96db73390262229340304527bb6032a5b1d8b092,True,False,,,,,0,1653672376,,0,{},ia7tivp,False,t3_uyu4l9,False,True,t1_ia6d7im,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyu4l9/david_ignatuis_washington_post_the_secret/ia7tivp/,1653672395,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653643576.0,

Are we really going to be able to help Ukraine?

In particular, Washington so far is failing, again, to operate with an adequate analysis of context regarding Ukraine while proceeding to fund programs devoid of anything resembling a properly mandated and organized monitoring and evaluation system. One can argue that it has no choice given the urgency and the state of affairs there, but still? 

According to the CATO Institute, a number of US officials (including members of Congress) “have created a stunningly misleading image of Ukraine” as “a plucky and noble bulwark of freedom and democracy. The conventional narrative would have us believe that Ukraine is an Eastern European version of Sweden, Denmark or Finland.” 

No, that's untrue. It might have, had it opted for the offered option to Zelensky to become a neutral country, but Ukrainians are not much for lukewarm options. As an American living and working in Europe, I travel for my job and I am well aware that not only Russia, but many Eastern European countries such as Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, Romania etc. are deep into corruption still, all the way to their justice system. ""Ukraine,” the CATO report notes, “has long been one of the more corrupt countries in the international system. In its annual report published in January 2022, Transparency International ranked Ukraine 123rd of the 180 countries it examined, with a score of 32 on a one-to-100-point scale.” This is a deeply ingrained vestige from the Soviet years: it pervades every aspect of the Ukrainian society. Ukraine is ruled by Oligarchs. What's most surprising is that a majority of Ukrainians today is still convinced that war, corruption, bribery and propaganda are a necessary part of life. It will take time to change that, obviously.
Ukraine has a recent history of fighting terrifying wars, the worst one being initiated by Kiev against Poland, and of being torn by massive internal civilian unrest and war, including in the Donbass. It has been under domination by Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and of course the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) which has profoundly shaped Ukrainian society. Full Independence was at last declared with the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in December 1991 but rampant corruption, rapid no-limit industrialization and intensive farming, and a total lack of effective pollution controls combined to seriously degrade the environment in Ukraine. Some of the most polluted areas in the world are now found there and much is to be done. When reconstruction will begin, taking care of pollution and the health of Ukrainians will be a priority.

While it seems unthinkable that the members of Congress could forget the lessons of Afghanistan so quickly when it comes to providing billions of dollars of poorly managed money to a deeply corrupt country like Ukraine, the reality is that the US has a history of acting almost naively and providing military assistance to corrupt causes, hoping that they would convert governments and populations to their democratic ways. But, each time, it became clear that they could not achieve their desired objectives. 

Who can forget: from 1961 until the fall of Saigon in April 1975, Washington kept hoping it would prevail because of the preeminence of US military equipment, doctrine, and training, and went on spending more than $141 billion supporting the South Vietnamese government in its war against communism, including tens of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment supplied as part of the so-called ‘Vietnamization’ program, which was designed to give the South Vietnamese military the ability to fight and win without direct US military assistance. When Saigon fell, it is estimated that North Vietnam captured some $5 billion in US military equipment, nearly half of which the North Vietnamese army was able to integrate into its force structure.
No doubt Russia would be able to do the same.

In the aftermath of the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, the US spent some $25 billion rebuilding an Iraqi military capable of standing on its own two feet. And yet, less than three years after the US withdrew its combat forces from Iraq, the Iraqi army, in the summer of 2014, collapsed against the forces of the Islamic State, abandoning not only the city of Mosul and vast swaths of territory to the Islamist movement, but also billions of dollars of US military equipment, including heavy tanks and artillery. Today, Iraquis are back to square one.

Similarly, between 2005 and 2021, the Afghan military received more than $18 billion worth of weapons from the US ‘arsenal of democracy’; but when the Afghan government collapsed in August 2021, more than $7 billion worth of advanced US military equipment fell into the hands of the Taliban.

This was not always the case. In March 1941, President Roosevelt helped put meaning behind the phrase ‘the arsenal of democracy’ when describing the mobilization of American industry for the purpose of arming allies to defeat fascism. Under the so-called ‘Lend-Lease Act’, the US provided billions of dollars of military aid to the United Kingdom, Russia, and China to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. The program’s impact was undeniable, and it played a critical role in enabling America’s wartime allies to survive and ultimately defeat the threat posed by a common foe.g

People seem to take for granted that everything Washington tells us about Ukraine is true. Considering that war is horrible, that Putin's invasion is wrong, that the much hoped for 'window of opportunity' for helping that Pro-Western Ukrainian part fight and disable Russia seems to have finally opened, and that Putin's authoritarian regime is easy to hate, it probably seems the perfect time to go for it.

Assuming Ukraine retakes all occupied territories, anyone there who identifies as Russian isn't going to feel welcome. With that in mind, I suspect that a significant percentage of the people being forcibly resettled in Russia know that they can't go back to Ukraine anyway.

And that's not even counting all the other Western countries. And no, the UK, one of the richest countries in the history of the world, is not ""broke"". That's just silly and shows how detached from reality your views are.

So you want Ukraine to surrender to save you a few dollars? We tried your strategy with the Nazis, it didn't work very well. Next.

Outside long range air defence like Patriot, the US Army is woefully lacking in SHORAD, mostly because they haven't had a use for it in any of their wars for decades and the expectation that the USAF would grant US forces air superiority by default.

The US Army knows that the Stinger is massively out of date and has recently started development on a new MANPADS system (no doubt because of Ukraine), but the optimistic timeline for full scale production is at minimum 5 years. 

This is essentially a panic buy being shoved into a production line that hasn't been active in any real capacity in decades and really should be shut down by now. Problem is, there are few NATO members that can produce their own MANPADS. France still produces Mistral, but they're not much younger than Stinger and France has a somewhat limited supply of them anyway.

The British are pretty much the only NATO members mass producing really modern MANPADS, namely Starstreak and Martlet. Problem is, 'mass production' in British terms is a snail's pace when it comes to warfare, with Ukraine probably eating through a month's production within a week, and the Brits are giving all they can afford atm.

For example... The no fly zone that people thankfully stopped calling for would mean NATO aircraft in direct confrontation with Russian aircraft and air defense.  *All* of the Russian aircraft would be destroyed, that's a given, but also some of the NATO planes.  Does NATO escalate further when its own pilots are killed?  Russia almost certainly would begin launching non-nuclear missiles into NATO countries in Eastern Europe in response to direct intervention.  Now those counter attacks have to be answered with more NATO counter attacks.  Pretty soon we're pushing close enough to Russia that they get desperate and launch the first nuke.

The calculus among NATO countries is clearly to give Ukraine enough to lock Russia in a long term war of attrition, which they just can't win and will destroy so much of their military equipment and experienced personnel that this will be their last war.  The temptation is obviously to just overwhelm the Russians right now and get it over with, but the threat of nukes is very real and so playing the long, safer game against them is the best option.

It sucks that Ukraine has to pay the price for defeating Russia in a slower, safer way but these are the options we have in the world right now.  Fight a very ugly proxy war or take a chance on the extinction of the human race.

They're very financially limited and the Leo2A4 upgrades are expensive, slow, and still don't really bring it up to the same standard as Challenger 3, Leo2A7 or M1A2 Abrams. Considering they're in the same position that West Germany was in during the 80s, they're very poorly equipped and financed by their allies while the Bundeswehr was armed to the teeth and extremely modern.

Whether Germany said they'd need to wait for replacement tanks or not, this has made them really vulnerable in that they now have a massive hole in what was already a somewhat fragile armoured capability. The PT-91 is a decent upgrade of the T-72 but it's still a T-72. The Leo2A4 is 40 years old and contemporary to the T-72 (comparable to the US still using M60A3s, or Britain using Chieftains). They're in a really tough situation and it'll take time before the M1A2s arrive, and given Russia's rhetoric about attacking Poland I don't blame them at all for getting nervous about their armoured fleet being caught short.

The Germans aren't exactly acting unreasonably either- the Bundeswehr is obviously going to struggle with modernisation given the post-unification decline, and they obviously can't pull 200 tanks out of their ass.

IMO there needs to be a more serious NATO-level discussion about equipping post-Soviet countries with modern equipment. Forward deploying a US armoured division or a British strike brigade (granted they're of dubious value) to Poland could at least cover the gap for now, but their procurement is piecemeal and obviously going too slowly to replace the arms sent to Ukraine.",13dfb0a7693b10e1255f1bccdbee1b4f7b10cf28,True,False,,,,,0,1653665054,,0,{},ia7bnch,False,t3_uyi07r,False,True,t3_uyi07r,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyi07r/germany_flabbergasted_at_polands_accusation_of/ia7bnch/,1653665068,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653636254.0,

That number also doesn't match any figures claimed by the US, Russian, or Ukrainian governments. The closest is the Russian government claim that Ukraine lost the comically precise 23,367 soldiers between 24 February and 16 April, which comes out to 458 soldiers per day on average. That's also orders of magnitude larger than the estimate of any other - Ukrainian, US, British.

With this being said, an economy that relies on just one sector for its lifeline - energy in Russia’s case - that will not be sustainable long term as the dependent countries will and are for the most part trying to find alternative to Russian fuel. I think that it will all come down to who can hold their poker face the longest, the EU/NATO, or Russia? I think that Putin is now banking on in fighting and squabbles between the nato nations and also likely
Doesn’t think that countries like Germany will truly go to alternate sources for fuel. Only time will tell. Russia cannot sustain these losses in material much longer, and Ukraine actually is mobilized for war so I would assume that their manpower advantage is about to become staggering",4703825d732d5b7ad99ec71344046755949f5e83,True,False,,,,,0,1653662818,,0,{},ia7693z,False,t3_uywfe1,False,True,t1_ia73u3r,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uywfe1/russian_forces_have_made_steady_incremental_gains/ia7693z/,1653662831,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653634018.0,

Sure that thst is all that many people have to go on in their knowledge of Russia - but you are completely correct in that it is far from the Soviet Union now, and it honestly appears a lot closer to being a modernized version of Russia in 1914 with the imperialistic views and need for expansion solely for the purpose of national pride and prestige. Russia doesn’t need more land, they have more critical natural resources than any other nation on earth.

“It serves Russian interests”

I mean other times they straight up say “this i anti German hatred” or “this is Russian disinfo”.

Like I’m seriously going to save this post and re comment Again when the cycle continues.

When Germans were criticising scholz for his bs with the list and then being called out by German military and companies,  German posters on this sub were coping hard. 

I remember they were downvoting everyone and sati g “shut up that was last week” Lol

Even saw a post  here where the top comments were then defending germanys honour by calling the Ukrainian ambassador insults . “Troll” and “cretin”.

Then when delays were announced and other issues they went quiet for a bit.

Now it’s back to business as usual.

I seriously don’t know why they’re so sensitive. I’ve seen people insult my country several times in this sub, I don’t get offended, never saw anyone else get offended. Seen the same about France, nobody got offended.

But for some reason German posters specifically on this sub keep making themselves out to be victims.

Like you just have a post pointing to legitimate criticism from another government or from within Germany and the top comment is “hey hey hey this German bashing is getting tired, poor Germany forget the Ukrainians being bombed we are really suffering here, wie traurig!!”

It’s without shame too, like it was actually ferocious seeing entire chains going ballistic when actually there was legit controversy over shholz but in here all it was, was a pity party of people upvoting each other saying “why are they always bashing us!! This is Russian bots right??”

“Must be Russian disinfo for someone to say something critical of mighty Germany!!”

Meanwhile you have comments of people bringing up France surrendering in ww2, Britain being corrupt and taking Russian money, criticising Americans for whatever reason. But nobody cares, as they should people don’t circle the wagons over it they just.. talk.

Should be noted that the author has a background in the italian army, which use Phz2000 and FH70 (which Italy gifted to ukraine), so it is a possible bias worth keeping in mind. When I see him comparing the FH70 favorably to the M777 (which is a 30 years more modern system) without even mentionning the M777's biggest relative asset (it weight half as much as the FH70 which make it much easier to manage logistics-wise), I tend to think the bias is confirmed. 

There's a bit of the same bias in the superlative lauding of the Pzh2000 too. The fact that it weight 55t or that the full autoloader and general ergonomy make it harder to maintain and repair that a system like the caesar (in particular in such a context, with mechanics who barely got a few weeks to be formed on a complex system and will have trouble with spare parts) isn't mentionned.

Logistically speaking I honestly think that the caesar (who got a basic truck frame thus easier to find spare parts, a simpler mechanism thus less prone to breakdowns and is wheeled+light and as such easier to bring to the front in a context of disrupted ukrainian logistics) is a more suited system to the Ukrainian situation rn.

Sure you’re correct, they need troops for their borders with NATO for Abkhazia, for South Ossetia, for Syria, for other abroad missions. But they’ve actually been drawing from them, even drawing from units in the Far East.

They didn’t “use their worst units” because t the VDV is definitely a professional unit.


They have also actively used spetsnaz and hardened Wagner and faced significant losses among these troops.

Also the troops they have  on active duty is different from numbers including reservists that would be mobilised in case of war. And following kofman and other such analysts they give details on the state of these reservists (No or little refresher training).

We also have information that on paper their units are inflated, it is the case for many armies but their actual combat strength is lower than what it should be on paper. It’s why they had to “cheat” at first with conscripts.

They’re actually lacking in infantryman its why they had to scramble and “mobilise” their fake republics grabbing every male possible from the streets.


I appreciate you’re a knowledgable scholar of the Soviet Union and the history of some seven decades ago but you could be falling into the mistake many make.

They often reel off factoids about the Soviet Union, about penal battalions, about the meat grinder and “waves of men” and proceed to apply it to modern Russia of 2022, which has the GDP of Italy and far fewer young males.  It results in a complete gibberish as they aren’t actually aware of the hard numbers about Russia and its military in 2022. Also conscription is actively dodged and they have political problems should they try to mobilise.

They don’t have a million people in terms of active duty personnel and they have committed most of their deployable force to this conflict, they truly wouldn’t have enough to in anyway seriously deploy against nato.

Again it sounds stupid; because it is:. That’s why people laugh at Putin for causing NATO to unite and likely get two new members while making Russia Weaker as he grinds his army to dust in Ukraine.",b85aa02b8a43bc08c13f05f9d04b5587947952d1,True,False,,,,,0,1653658525,,0,{},ia6wlk9,False,t3_uywfe1,False,True,t1_ia6ulz2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uywfe1/russian_forces_have_made_steady_incremental_gains/ia6wlk9/,1653658542,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653629725.0,

Mass torture and killing of civilians - so much so it appears this was the aim as they are kidnapping and removing anyone left and replacing them with Russian military and administration of each area.

Russia is also either destroying outright economic interests or blocking others including the ports in the Black Sea so now the special military operation can cause starvation of people in other countries. 

Russia is using any and all weapons except nukes, stuff that is questionable it should be made let alone used like the suffocation/burn alive weapon in addition to the also burning type phosporous weapon.

Even if you believe that it's ""short on precision weapons"", At that point, russia will become even more indiscriminate.

The point is the west needs to ""go big."" The supply of weapons and resources to Ukraine needs to be much more, including the specific sort of weapons that Kuleba keeps repeating.  Those are what Ukraine needs to get away from the terrible losses it is suffering now on the front and to inflict manpower and morale losses on russia.

“An ongoing study from the Kyiv School of Economics calculates that every week, Ukraine suffers about $4.5 billion worth of damage to civilian infrastructure, and the country's total economic losses could rise to around $600 billion.”

""We can also look at other measures and similar efforts that were done in the past. For example, what was the cost of reconstructing Iraq or Afghanistan? If you look at the size of these countries, the level of damage, and scale it to the Ukrainian case, you come to somewhere between $500 billion, maybe $1 trillion.""

Rebuilding poses the opportunity to build a modernized Ukraine better than ever before:

“Although Russia's invasion has caused massive damage, some experts also see reconstruction as a once-in-a-generation chance to modernize Ukraine.”

“Gorodnichenko believes the country's newly rebuilt cities should be carbon-neutral and dense, with much needed upgrades to housing and public transport.”

""We should really rebuild Ukraine up to modern standards,"" Gorodnichenko said. ""And this is going to be good not only in terms of climate change ... but it also makes Ukraine less vulnerable to future blackmail from Russia ... So you can kill two birds with one stone.""

But where is a TRILLION DOLLARS coming from to fund the restoration of Ukrainian infrastructure?

“The U.S. and several other nations have announced they support a comprehensive plan for supporting and rebuilding Ukraine. The U.S. Senate passed a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine last week, but Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a speech in Brussels that, ""Eventually, Ukraine will need massive support and private investment for reconstruction and recovery, akin to the task of rebuilding in Europe after 1945.""

""What's clear is that the bilateral and multilateral support announced so far will not be sufficient to address Ukraine's needs, even in the short term,"" Yellen said.

“In addition to support from allied nations, Gorodnichenko said Russian assets seized as a result of sanctions could be used to foot the bill. Yellen, however, said last week that, ""While we're beginning to look at this, it would not be legal now in the United States for the government to seize those assets.""

“Gorodnichenko said the international community could also use historical precedent to find ways to make Russia pay for Ukraine's reconstruction, even if it didn't agree to pay reparations. He said that after WWII, American officials froze Nazi assets in the U.S., and then used those to compensate victims of war crimes.”

Justice means Ukraine will be rebuilt into a flourishing nation of abundance and freedom.

Justice means Russia should pay for as much of the cost as possible.

Seized Russian assets should be used to pay for what Putin’s unjustified invasion has destroyed.",5256d4819938fac8afa537b962d984e78a1ab7ac,True,False,,,,,0,1653656331,,0,{},ia6s3v8,True,t3_uyxfra,False,True,t3_uyxfra,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyxfra/heres_how_much_it_could_cost_to_rebuild_ukraine/ia6s3v8/,1653656347,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653627531.0,

Behind their positions, Ukrainian forces have tanks, artillery and mortars to back Lapko’s men and other units along the front. But when the tanks or mortars are fired, the Russians respond with Grad rockets, often in areas where Lapko’s men are taking cover. In some cases, his troops have found themselves with no artillery support.  
This is, in part, because Lapko has not been provided a radio, he said. So there’s no contact with his superiors in Lysychansk, preventing him from calling for help.  
The men accuse the Russians of using phosphorous bombs, incendiary weapons that are banned by international law if used against civilians.  
“It explodes at 30 to 50 meters high and goes down slowly and burns everything,” Khrus said.  
“Do you know what we have against phosphorous?” Lapko asked. “A glass of water, a piece of cloth to cover your mouth with!”  
Both Lapko and Khrus expect to die at the front. That is why Lapko carries a pistol.  
“It’s just a toy against them, but I have it so that if they take me I will shoot myself,” he said.  
Survival  
Despite the hardships, his men have fought courageously, Lapko said. Pointing at Khrus, he declared: “This guy here is a legend, a hero.” Khrus and his platoon, his commander said, have killed more than 50 Russian soldiers in close-up battles.  
In a recent clash, he said, his men attacked two Russian armored vehicles carrying about 30 soldiers, ambushing them with grenades and guns.  
“Their mistake was not to come behind us,” Lapko said. “If they would have done that, I wouldn’t be talking to you here now.”  
Lapko has recommended 12 of his men for medals of valor, including two posthumously.  
The war has taken a heavy toll on his company — as well as on other Ukrainian forces in the area. Two of his men were killed, among 20 fatalities in the battalion as a whole, and “many are wounded and in recovery now,” he said.  
Then there are those who are traumatized and have not returned.  
“Many got shell shock. I don’t know how to count them,” Lapko said.  
The casualties here are largely kept secret to protect morale among troops and the general public.  
“On Ukrainian TV we see that there are no losses,” Lapko said. “There’s no truth.”  
Most deaths, he added, were because injured soldiers were not evacuated quickly enough, often waiting as long as 12 hours for transport to a military hospital in Lysychansk, 15 miles away. Sometimes, the men have to carry an injured soldier on a stretcher as far as two miles on foot to find a vehicle, Lapko said. Two vehicles assigned to his company never arrived, he said, and are being used instead by people at military headquarters.  
“If I had a car and was told that my comrade is wounded somewhere, I’d come anytime and get him,” said Lapko, who used his own beat-up car to travel from Lysychansk to the hotel. “But I don’t have the necessary transport to get there.”  
Retreat  
Lapko and his men have grown increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with their superiors. His request for the awards has not been approved. His battalion commander demanded that he send 20 of his soldiers to another front line, which meant that he couldn’t rotate his men out from Toshkivka. He refused the order.  
The final affront arrived last week when he arrived at military headquarters in Lysychansk after two weeks in Toshkivka. His battalion commander and team had moved to another town without informing him, he said, taking food, water and other supplies.  
“They left us with no explanation,” Lapko said. “I think we were sent here to close a gap and no one cares if we live or die.”  
So he, Khrus and several members of their company drove the 60 miles to Druzhkivka to stay in a hotel for a few days. “My guys wanted to wash themselves for the first time in a month,” Lapko said. “You know, hygiene! We don’t have it. We sleep in basements, on mattresses with rats running around.”  
He and his men insisted that they want to return to the front.  
“We’re ready to fight and we will keep on fighting,” Lapko said. “We will protect every meter of our country — but with adequate commandments and without unrealistic orders. I took an oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people. We’re protecting Ukraine and we won’t let anyone in as long as we’re alive.”  
But on Monday, Ukraine’s military security services arrived at the hotel and took Khrus and other members of his platoon to a detention center for two days, accusing them of desertion. Lapko was stripped of his command, according to an order reviewed by The Post. He is being held at the base in Lysychansk, his future uncertain.  
Reached by phone Wednesday, he said two more of his men had been wounded on the front line.

DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine — Stuck in their trenches, the Ukrainian volunteers lived off a potato per day as Russian forces pounded them with artillery and Grad rockets on a key eastern front line. Outnumbered, untrained and clutching only light weapons, the men prayed for the barrage to end — and for their own tanks to stop targeting the Russians.

“They \[Russians\] already know where we are, and when the Ukrainian tank shoots from our side it gives away our position,” said Serhi Lapko, their company commander, recalling the recent battle. “And they start firing back with everything — Grads, mortars.  
“And you just pray to survive.”  
Ukrainian leaders have projected and nurtured a public image of military invulnerability — of their volunteer and professional forces triumphantly standing up to the Russian onslaught. Videos of assaults on Russian tanks or positions are posted daily on social media. Artists are creating patriotic posters, billboards and T-shirts. The postal service even released stamps commemorating the sinking of a Russian warship in the Black Sea.  
Ukrainian forces have succeeded in thwarting Russian efforts to seize Kyiv and Kharkiv and have scored battlefield victories in the east. But the experience of Lapko and his group of volunteers offers a rare and more realistic portrait of the conflict and Ukraine’s struggle to halt the Russian advance in parts of Donbas. Ukraine, like Russia, has provided scant information about deaths, injuries or losses of military equipment. But after three months of war, this company of 120 men is down to 54 because of deaths, injuries and desertions.  
The volunteers were civilians before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, and they never expected to be dispatched to one of the most dangerous front lines in eastern Ukraine. They quickly found themselves in the crosshairs of war, feeling abandoned by their military superiors and struggling to survive.  
“Our command takes no responsibility,” Lapko said. “They only take credit for our achievements. They give us no support.”  
When they could take it no longer, Lapko and his top lieutenant, Vitaliy Khrus, retreated with members of their company this week to a hotel away from the front. There, both men spoke to The Washington Post on the record, knowing they could face a court-martial and time in military prison.

“If I speak for myself, I’m not a battlefield commander,” he added. “But the guys will stand by me, and I will stand by them till the end.”  
The volunteers’ battalion commander, Ihor Kisileichuk, did not respond to calls or written questions from The Post in time for publication, but he sent a terse message late Thursday saying: “Without this commander, the unit protects our land,” in an apparent reference to Lapko. A Ukrainian military spokesman declined immediate comment, saying it would take “days” to provide a response.  
“War breaks people down,” said Serhiy Haidai, head of the regional war administration in Luhansk province, acknowledging many volunteers were not properly trained because Ukrainian authorities did not expect Russia to invade. But he maintained that all soldiers are taken care of: “They have enough medical supplies and food. The only thing is there are people that aren’t ready to fight.”  
But Lapko and Khrus’s concerns were echoed recently by a platoon of the 115th Brigade 3rd Battalion, based nearby in the besieged city of Severodonetsk. In a video uploaded to Telegram on May 24, and confirmed as authentic by an aide to Haidai, volunteers said they will no longer fight because they lacked proper weapons, rear support and military leadership.  
“We are being sent to certain death,” said a volunteer, reading from a prepared script, adding that a similar video was filmed by members of the 115th Brigade 1st Battalion. “We are not alone like this, we are many.”

Ukraine’s military rebutted the volunteers’ claims in their own video posted online, saying the “deserters” had everything they needed to fight: “They thought they came for a vacation,” one service member said. “That’s why they left their positions.”  
Hours after The Post interviewed Lapko and Khrus, members of Ukraine’s military security service arrived at their hotel and detained some of their men, accusing them of desertion.  
The men contend that they were the ones who were deserted.  
Waiting to die  
Before the invasion, Lapko was a driller of oil and gas wells. Khrus bought and sold power tools. Both lived in the western city of Uzhhorod and joined the territorial defense forces, a civilian militia that sprung up after the invasion.  
Lapko, built like a wrestler, was made a company commander in the 5th Separate Rifle Battalion, in charge of 120 men. The similarly burly Khrus became a platoon commander under Lapko. All of their comrades were from western Ukraine. They were handed AK-47 rifles and given training that lasted less than a half-hour.  
“We shot 30 bullets and then they said, ‘You can’t get more; too expensive,’ ” Lapko said.  
They were given orders to head to the western city of Lviv. When they got there, they were ordered to go south and then east into Luhansk province in Donbas, portions of which were already under the control of Moscow-backed separatists and are now occupied by Russian forces. A couple dozen of his men refused to fight, Lapko said, and they were imprisoned.  
The ones who stayed were based in the town of Lysychansk. From there, they were dispatched to Toshkivka, a front-line village bordering the separatist areas where the Russian forces were trying to advance. They were surprised when they got the orders.  
“When we were coming here, we were told that we were going to be in the third line on defense,” Lapko said. “Instead, we came to the zero line, the front line. We didn’t know where we were going.”  
The area has become a focal point of the war, as Moscow concentrates its military might on capturing the region. The city of Severodonetsk, near Lysychansk, is surrounded on three sides by Russian forces. Over the weekend, they destroyed one of three bridges into the city, and they are constantly shelling the other two. Ukrainian troops inside Severodonetsk are fighting to prevent the Russians from completely encircling the city.  
That’s also the mission of Lapko’s men. If Toshkivka falls, the Russians can advance north toward Lysychansk and completely surround Severodonetsk. That would also allow them to go after larger cities in the region.  
When the volunteers first arrived, their rotations in and out of Toshkivka lasted three or four days. As the war intensified, they stayed for a week minimum, sometimes two. “Food gets delivered every day except for when there are shellings or the situation is bad,” Khrus said.  
And in recent weeks, he said, the situation has gotten much worse. When their supply chains were cut off for two days by the bombardment, the men were forced to make do with a potato a day.  
They spend most days and nights in trenches dug into the forest on the edges of Toshkivka or inside the basements of abandoned houses. “They have no water, nothing there,” Lapko said. “Only water that I bring them every other day.”  
It’s a miracle the Russians haven’t pushed through their defensive line in Toshkivka, Khrus said as Lapko nodded. Besides their rifles and hand grenades, the only weapons they were given were a handful of rocket-propelled grenades to counter the well-equipped Russian forces. And no one showed Lapko’s men how to use the RPGs.  
“We had no proper training,” Lapko said.  
“It’s around four RPGs for 15 men,” Khrus said, shaking his head.  
The Russians, he said, are deploying tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, Grad rockets and other forms of artillery — when they try to penetrate the forest with ground troops or infantry vehicles, they can easily get close enough “to kill.”  
“The situation is controllable but difficult,” Khrus said. “And when the heavy weapons are against us, we don’t have anything to work with. We are helpless.”",76f02e3f568a00034899b08bd8ce8ef26edf8354,True,False,,,,,0,1653655692,,0,{},ia6qvqb,False,t3_uyoos2,False,True,t3_uyoos2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyoos2/ukrainian_volunteer_fighters_in_the_east_feel/ia6qvqb/,1653655706,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653626892.0,

&gt; Thats probably the cheapest you can go in German populism and the talk about ""German funded politicians"" shows where this comes from. 

As i mentioned - it's my own experience and i don't seek validation for it.

&gt; I get that Germany is a large neighbour for Poland to be wary of, but these PiS lies are just stupid.

Nowadays Germany is not that much considered as a direct threat, as in INVASION IS IMMINENT as it's seen as deranged oldman with too much cash earned through the years who's not up to the times. They still think that you can deal with imperialists in russia. They are being bought by russian oligarchs and that's being seen as a threat, because history shows while Poland tended to fair quite well against EITHER russia OR Germany, it never did well against both.

We are quite sure that if help of Ukraine depended on Germany and not on Poland - Ukraine would be lost. I myself am thoroughly surprised that despite acting as putin's tools PiS found it in themselves to open Polish borders for Ukrainian refugees and make Poland military hub for weapon systems and munitions delivery to Ukraine. I'm 99% sure that if it was Germany or pro-German government deliveries of lethal weaponry would be limited to the point of leaving Ukraine to pretty much fend off by themselves.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

Germany doesn't send anything heavy. Doesn't approve what is requested. Announces miserable quantities and delays what is announced in months. And lies, lies, lies. 

&gt; Since when am I the Secretary General of NATO?

I don't remember Stoltenberg ever said that NATO will or won't send heavy weapons to Ukraine. Each member decides individually. Many are sending, many don't, and Germany is playing games.

&gt; “Something heavy” is irrelevant if there’s a NATO agreement barring IFVs and MBTs.

Show me the agreement. So far it's just another excuse made by German officials. Most likely it's one lie among many others.

&gt; Those are unfounded claims, and offer no explanation why NS2 was allegedly that crucial to Russia, but Russia didn’t bother to wait until it was operational.

NS2 is still built, full of ""technical"" gas and can be started any time. Its cancellation is purely formal and can be cancelled anytime. If it was started, Germany still could shut it down after Russian attack.

Why they have attacked this Feb? NS2 was finished and filled with technical gas and was ready to be started. Russia spent last months gathering people near our borders and planned their huge drills right on the planned time of approval. But in the Autumn, the UK and US started to uncover Russian plans which created more pressure on Germany and made it slow down the processor of NS2 final approval. They were ready and couldn't wait longer - you can't keep people in the field for years. This is fucking obvious for everyone except somehow you.

&gt; Unfortunately not.

You declared such neutrality. Even refused to sell weapons to Ukraine (but secretly kept selling them to Russia).

Well, you think wrong.  
Germany has deliberately subverted the Kennan Doctrine for the last 50 years, despite it deriving from the medieval Russian Bear Doctrine from medieval Livonia ruled by Baltic Germans, based on finno-ugric folklore on bears.  
  
Russia's power verticals (Cheka / NKVD / KGB / FSB and the army) have been in power for the last 104+ years. It is as if Germany were still led by Gestapo and Wehrmacht and the largest opposition party was NSDAP.  
  
And despite all that Germany even tried to force Estonia accepting the Nordstream gas pipe into Estonian waters against the will of the Estonia's Academy of Sciences.

Still, instead of taking decisive action we try to avoid the problem. ""It's China's problem since they produce all the crap we buy"". We know it will be tough to do any actual changes ourselves.

It was based on kissinger's ""appeasement"" statements.    Zelensky wouldn't be talking about talking to putin if he didn't ultimately envision territorial compromise.  That is the sad position ukraine is in right now.  That is the very sad reality.  15 1962 M113As from Lithuania is not going to change that.*

It's easy to act ""internet tough"" and to call kissinger an appeaser.  The last thing I want is for Ukraine to give up an inch of territory.  and kissinger is a piece of shit.

However, the sad reality is that right now, Ukraine has no credible prospect of making a serious counterattack to reclaim territory and if they did, the russians would reply asymmetrically with missile attacks on large ukrainian cities.   Yes, some weaponry from the US is coming - but it's hard to see it being enough given that in terms of manpower, Ukraine is starting to dig into its untrained reserves while Russia's meat well runs deep.  Ukraine holds no cards of its own:  its military forces are on the back foot, and its economy is in tatters.  It is entirely dependent on support from the west - support that is wavering as realpolitik rears its ugly head.

If i got it correct, kissinger proposed ceding donetsk and luhansk oblasts.   unfortunately, the reality is that russia is in a position to take kherson and most of zaporizha too as it now stand - again, with very little that Ukraine can do about it militarily.

  
can we hope for miracles?   sure.   but those people who chanted 'kerson is ukraine' are long gone from the region in one way or another.  meanwhile, i spend too much time in this subreddit quarreling with idiots who are making excuse after excuse as to why their country (hello germany!  hello israel!  hello czechia!  hello france denmark netherlands etc etc etc) that they have some interest in doesn't need to help more and why can't the US just do it or at least pay for it?

  
this is the sad reality.   **i think in a couple of weeks or months we may see zelensky make a very difficult speech that will see him branded a traitor by many**.  my guess is that it will be

  
\- end of hostilities  
\- 4 oblasts (or most of 4 oblasts) basically to russia  
\- ukraine 'neutral' status.  however, also a UN military force on the ground in Ukraine manned by NATO personnel acting as a further deterrent.  
\- the lifting of many sanctions on russia in exchange for certain economic concessions (odessa port routes open).

  
unless there is a realistic hope for a miracle, i think ukraine will have to take this. again, this is awful, but you can't conjure up a counterattack force from thin air and russia has every advantage militarily in terms of short logistic lines and manpower plus occupied populations who will quickly adapt to their new overlords.

  
and, to be clear, ukraine might still win militarily.  its not entirely impossible. things can happen.  the future is uncertain... but also realistically ukraine could still lose it all, including kyiv and beyond.",68b18c4ce03c51aeeed9e975a55f5fc53e9f4991,True,False,,,,,0,1653652144,,0,{},ia6kqls,False,t3_uywd1o,False,True,t3_uywd1o,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uywd1o/ukraine_needs_to_face_reality/ia6kqls/,1653652162,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653623344.0,

Since when Stoltenberg is responsible for your actions?

&gt; Let me know when the first Abrams or Challengers are in Ukraine.

Let me know when Germany sends at least something heavy. Because US, France, Italy, and the others have already sent and their weapons are already fighting. 

&gt; And Russia waited patiently for it several years, but couldn’t wait another month until the certification was done, too?

Once again. This time read carefully. If they managed to defeat us in those 3 days, and then ""accidentally"" destroy our pipe, you'd already started NS2 and kept making sad face ""oh we have no choice!"". I bet Scholz is still going to run it one day.

You were neutral up to Feb 24. But German ""neutrality"" means helping the enemies of the West and taking dirty Russian money. I am afraid it's no longer possible.

Vietnam can be communist as much as Germany could be Nazi. It only works after they genocide any dissent. Do you forget about the Vietnamese killings of the non-communist Vietnamese? You have their blood on your hands. You would never be president of the US just because you would be the Vietnamese Pol Pot :))))

You have no clue how the world outside Vietnam works, let alone your own history. Why must Ukraine ruin itself just so Germany and Vietnam can have strong economies? Lets give Vietnam to Russia, in the name of peace right? Suddenly appeasement isn't such a good idea when it affects you does it, comrade?  


According to you, if Vietnamese soldiers ever go into another country it is not to help that country but to increase Vietnam's power?  Thankfully you're some random jackass on the internet and the amount of Vietnamese people I have met makes me confident you are in the fringe from the norm.

&gt;Still Israel helped the Russian military, and that drone was recently used. So it's not true that only the US benefits from Israeli tech. And I can give other examples.

I didn't claim only the US benefits from Israeli tech. Israel is a major supplier for most of Europe, some African and south American nations, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Philippines, and others in the SEA region.

Yeah, it maybe helped Russia, but there are nuances here. Israel is the least offender here, and it has to be taken in the context of the time back then, not today.
There are also benefits to this, like more income for the west to invest in the next gen, and increased Russian dependence on the west. 

For example, Thales optics and FCS in Russian tanks basically means that as long as France has sanctions on Russia, Russia can't produce any more new tanks.

Another example, Russia only has Forpost and Orlan-10 UAVs forming the backbone of its fleet. With Israeli sanctions, we see Russia is no longer operating its Forpost in Ukraine, likely grounded as Russia cannot secure spare parts. And with western sanctions in general, it can only rely on its existing supply of Orlan-10 which use western components.
That's how the EU deters European nations from fighting with one another - too many economical dependencies.

&gt;The Independent article is from 1993, the military.com article is more recent and is from 2013 and covers a more recent case.

You didn't link the article. Doesn't matter though, found it myself. 
What's the point here really? 
Israel didn't have regulations, someone found an illegal sale, dude responsible was fired, legislation was passed to require export permits on every defense item, and it never happened since. Problem solved.

It's not like Israel had an interest in this. If a technology is license made in Israel for local use, it probably means a sensitive piece of tech used on local defense systems was now leaked to Israel's enemies.

We've heard of only a few cases like this. Every time, it was a small event that was fixed, not something that grew into a scandal.

The USSR was in the Allied force, they fought against the Axis while you said they never even fight Japan. Did you forget what you typed?

Thanks to American liberations, many countries including Vietnam suffered heavy bombings. 

Americans fought for America's power and influence, democracy was never the direct cause for their wars. America didn't need to invade Venezuela cause they can deal heavy damage with sanctions alone. Remember the Cuban missile crisis? Why did America freak out when Cuba kept Soviet nukes? Cuba has the right to do so, right? Before that crisis, Americans pulled the Bay of Pigs invasion, was to ""liberate"" Cuba?:))) Solomon island wanted to sign a military pact with China, and apparently America didn't take it too well. Americans believed in the domino theory and started a war in Vietnam. Can't Vietnam follow communism? Why should Americans decide what ideology Vietnam should follow?

Ho Chi Minh liberated Vietnamese from colonization, fought against American imperialism. It was Westerners who enslaved Vietnam, and brought war to my country. It's the West who doesn't have the right to teach people on how to be free. You people caused terror in the Asia, Africa and the Middle East. America even supports the apartheid state of Israel.

Germany can care for Ukraine all they want. But as you can see, there's a limit to how much they are willing to help. They're not going to give up Russian oil right away, in the long run maybe, but not in short term. They cannot risk harming their own economy for some foreigners, they helped a bit, but that's the limit.

I said Ukraine should have gone neutral and make appeasements BEFORE the war. Had they been neutral, war wouldn't have happened. Now that war has already started, it's a different situation.

If American soldiers are that willing to die for Ukraine, then i wonder why Biden isn't sending some to Ukraine. I mean send official American troops, not some half ass merc to the foreign legion. Or maybe enforce NFZ. Why did you think no Western leaders wanted to send troops or enforce NFZ in Ukraine?

Ukrainian language is the one suffering and it is important to keep it alive. That's why it was established as the official language of the state, and all public schools must teach in Ukrainian language and all government facilities must do their bureaucracy in Ukrainian too. And the law was actually designed also to help ethnic minorities integrate into Ukrainian society without oppressing their own culture.

The west is nowhere near united on Ukraine at this point, with certain european nations actively undermining the Ukrainian position every damned day. NATO annual military spending is similar to Russia's entire GDP, the US' annual military budget alone is over 5 times higher than Ukraine's entire GDP. 

There are thousands of modern M1s sitting in mothballs that could be deployed (training to US peacetime timetables for armor crewmen, had it started on day one of the war, would be finishing up within the next month and could undoubtedly be expedited) and incredibly lethal munitions that could easily be deployed by existing Ukrainian assets, such as SMArt 155 and SaDARM smart clustermunitions, or the CBU97SFW, any of which can wipe out entire groups of russian armored vehicles with a single deployment. We have not been giving them our best equipment, or anything close to it. We're not even giving them the best equipment we had 30 years ago. While American howitzers (and hopefully HIMARS) are a promising sign, the west has so far supplied Ukraine as if it has already lost. And the US (along with Poland, Czech and UK) are the high water mark, Germany's performance in this area has been nothing short of disgraceful. Compare what we're giving Ukraine to what we wasted on the ANA and Iraqi Army.

B. Ignoring the above, if the issue is that Ukraine can't win without the west joining the war, then the west should intervene immediately by seizing Kaliningrad while its garrison forces are understrength and eliminating what's left of the black sea fleet with air-launched Harpoons to create a secure route for allied aircraft to ingress towards the southern front.",5fd164dbf7dc7dc7bb00704d90ba7539922f9f39,True,False,,,,,0,1653645736,,0,{},ia6bzgq,False,t3_uypv8y,False,True,t1_ia5tkqq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uypv8y/stop_playing_with_russia_end_war_ukrainian_prez/ia6bzgq/,1653645747,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653616936.0,

&gt; About 70 bodies have been found on the territory of the former Oktuabr plant on Kuindzhi Street in Mariupol as occupying forces went through the rubble, says the adviser to the mayor, Petro Andriushchenko.

&gt; The bodies of the dead have been packed in plastic bags and taken for burial in a mass grave in the village of Staryy Krym.

&gt; Reminder: On Tuesday 24 May, we reported on the discovery of around 200 bodies in an advanced state of decomposition when the rubble of a high-rise building in Mariupol was searched.

And if it was - how can you seriously use this secret unofficial treachery pact as a sincere excuse.

T72s are not western equipment. At the moment this is pure speculation, but once again, where are the western IFVs and MBTs?

&gt; After Russia attacked Ukraine, occupied huge parts of our land, and killed 15000 people, Germany lobbied light sanctions and built NS2 whose sole purpose was to kick Ukraine out of the business and allow Russia to safely attack us without potential risks for Germany. 
The damn pipe was our insurance and you worked hard to make this war will happen. Many countries tried to reach you, but you are so arrogant and greedy and never listen to dirty eastern-europeans.

That’s why Germany stopped the certification for NS2 right *before* the invasion. Doesn’t make any sense, right?

In 2012 Ukraine introduced a bill that allowed municipalities to give ""regional language status"" to languages other than Ukrainian, where national minorities made up more than 10% of the population. This allowed the civil administration to use these languages (i.e schools could teach in languages other than Ukrainian, courts could use them). In some small areas this applied to Hungarian and Romanian but primarily this affected the Russian language since Russians are by far the largest ethno-linguistic minority group in Ukraine. 

In 2014, the government was overthrown. The removed administration was heavily supported by Ukraine's Russian speaking minority and was perceived to be friendly to Russian speaking Ukrainians. The new administration immediately (literally the day after the president was ousted) began the process of repealing the 2012 language law. This was met with protests in southern and eastern Ukraine alongside protests about ousting of the government more generally and the violence from these is what spiralled into the Donbas War.

You can argue that the repeal of the 2012 law war oppressive or that it wasn't, clearly that is up for debate.

Russia must now defend a long front and substantial occupied territory. Its forces are already stretched and Moscow is scrambling to find reserves. The Ukrainians can’t wait too long but they will not want to move hard against Russian strongholds until they are ready.

The first instruction that Secretary of State Antony Blinken got from President Biden was to “reset” America’s alliances and partnerships abroad so that the United States could deal with the challenges ahead. That strategy would prove decisive in combating Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
Blinken and other officials gave me new details this week, describing a series of behind-the-scenes meetings over the past year that helped forge the U.S.-led coalition to support Ukraine. His narrative validates President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s observation in a 1957 speech: “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”

The Biden administration’s secret planning began in April 2021 when Russia massed about 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border. The buildup turned out to be a feint, but Blinken and other officials discussed U.S. intelligence about Russia’s actions with leaders of Britain, France and Germany at a NATO meeting in Brussels that month. Their message was, “We need to get ourselves prepared,” a senior State Department official said.

Germany was a reluctant but essential ally, and the Biden administration made a controversial decision last summer that was probably crucial in gaining German support against Russia. Biden gave Germany a pass on an initial round of sanctions against a company building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in exchange for a pledge from Chancellor Angela Merkel that if Russia invaded, Nord Stream 2 would be scrapped. When the invasion came, Merkel was gone but her successor, Olaf Scholz, kept the promise.

By avoiding a crisis with Germany early on, Blinken said, “the net result was that the foundation was in place when the Russians went ahead with the aggression.”

This U.S. diplomacy gets high marks from Emily Haber, the German ambassador to Washington. “The wording in the joint statement [about Nord Stream] was vague, but the administration trusted the old — and later the new — chancellor to follow up on it. Which is what happened,” she told me. “A sublime form, I thought, of partnership management.”

The Ukraine threat got red-hot in October, when the United States gathered intelligence about a renewed Russian buildup on the border, along with “some detail about what Russian plans for those forces actually were,” Blinken said. This operational detail “was really the eye opener.” The Group of 20 nations were meeting at the end of October in Rome, and Biden pulled aside the leaders of Britain, France and Germany and gave them a detailed readout on the top-secret evidence.

“It was galvanizing enough that there was an agreement … to fleshing out the consequences for Russia if it went ahead with the aggression,” Blinken said.
CIA Director William J. Burns traveled to Moscow on Nov. 1 to warn President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its allies were prepared to arm Ukraine and impose crippling sanctions on Russia if he invaded. Putin apparently thought Biden wouldn’t be able to deliver.

Persuading Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to take the invasion danger seriously wasn’t easy, initially. Blinken spoke to him at the COP 21 climate summit in Glasgow in early November and provided a summary of intelligence about Russia’s plans. “I basically had the task of telling him that we thought it was likely that his country was going to be invaded,” Blinken recalled. Zelensky was skeptical, according to a State Department official.

Threatening sanctions can be an empty diplomatic ritual. But in December, Blinken and his colleagues began seriously discussing with allies what steps they would take. The initial venue was a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Liverpool, England, on Dec. 11. The attendees publicly committed that there would be “massive consequences and severe costs,” Blinken remembered. As a result, he said, “when the aggression actually happened, we were able to move immediately.”

NATO military planning accelerated along with the diplomacy. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, the NATO commander, told me that his colleagues began preparing in December and January the “ground lines of communication” that would allow rapid shipment of arms into Ukraine. They studied entry points for supplies and other practical details. This weapons pipeline delivered Stinger and Javelin missiles before the invasion began Feb. 24 and has transferred huge numbers of heavier weapons since then.

U.S. intelligence provided Ukraine with a preview of Putin’s battle plan. Though Russia had surrounded Ukraine with 150,000 troops, Putin’s real strategy was a lightning, decapitating strike on Kyiv by a relatively small group of elite special forces. The Russians planned to seize Antonov Airport in Hostomel, west of the capital, and then use it to quickly pump troops into Kyiv.

The Ukrainians knew the Russians were coming. Burns had secretly traveled to Kyiv in January to brief Zelensky on the Russian plan, according to two knowledgeable officials. 

The Ukrainians used the U.S. intelligence to devastate the attacking force at Hostomel, in what may turn out to be the decisive battle of the war. “The Russians had no Plan B,” explained Marek Menkiszak, a Polish intelligence analyst with the Centre for Eastern Studies in Warsaw.

Menkiszak explained the significance of intelligence coup that revealed the decapitation plan: “The Russians trapped themselves. … It was not meant to be a full-scale war but a special operation” that would topple Zelensky’s government and install a pliant, pro-Moscow regime.

Through the buildup to war, Biden sometimes seemed to misspeak. But he had a clear-eyed view of the evolving strategic terrain. Early on, for example, Biden concluded that the best way to derail Putin’s hope for dividing NATO would be the accession of two strong new members, Finland and Sweden.
Biden wooed Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. He called him in December and then in January to talk about the Russian threat, Blinken said. Biden then invited Niinisto to visit the White House in March, and while they were sitting in the Oval Office, Biden suggested they call Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, reaching her late at night. By May, the two were visiting the White House together, celebrating their countries’ plans to join NATO.
The Biden administration’s organization of this coalition to support Ukraine may look simple in retrospect. 

But it was a complicated coordination of diplomatic, military and intelligence resources that pulled together dozens of nations at what may prove to be a hinge point in modern history. Putin thought he could roll through Biden and the West to an easy victory in Kyiv. The Russian leader made a catastrophic mistake in overvaluing his own strength and underestimating the resolve of Biden and his team.",f5cfa2b30a9237e201c312422ec18f98aee0f3e1,True,False,,,,,0,1653642453,,0,{},ia68beu,True,t3_uyu4l9,False,True,t3_uyu4l9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyu4l9/david_ignatuis_washington_post_the_secret/ia68beu/,1653642466,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653613653.0,

There is not a war in Ukraine because Germany doesnt send certain kind of weapons. The war in Ukraine wasnt conceived, planned, and executed the 24th of February. It's the product of years of buying/promoting politicians, elections, referendums, and creating a vast network of  influence. I guess when Putin managed to insert his operatives in the capitol riots, he thought he could do anything, just in case its ties with Trump, Brexit, Scotland referendum, Londongrad, Catalonia, and gas werent enough. Everybody fucked up then, and that's one of the reasons Ukraine is invaded now. The only, only thing Putin didnt expect was a common inmediate response from the west. But looks like at least he will get what he wanted, by making people think a geopolitical change of this caliber is measured just in who sends more weapons.

Yes

Nope. ~4% net reduction in GDP. You'd be in recession, -2% next year instead of 2% growth.

&gt; Destroy the industry that you want them to use to help Ukraine?

First of all, that's completely wrong and hyperbolic. But regardless, the announced aid from Germany - even any *conceivable* aid you would provide to Ukraine, is orders of magnitude less than the amounts you are *currently paying Russia*. You are providing hundreds of millions of Euros *a day* to Russia. 

Ukraine would be better off in the current conflict if Germany simply didn't exist.

""Look, we havent told the Americans that they aren't allowed to use an airbase"" is their argument for being involved in logistics.

From what I understand, most road and train logistics happen from airbases in Romania and Poland. I doubt trucks drive from Ramstein to Ukraine with ammo...

Why can't Germans just accept that they are not delivering anything remotely close to what their size of economy would imply? That their Chancellor is using every excuse to postpone and complicate, adding red tape and overpromising? Instead of accepting this, and putting pressure on the Chancellor to step up, all we hear is ""you're doing Putin's budding by criticising us"".

&gt;https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/russian-forpost-r-uav-based-on-iais-searcher-2-shot-down-near-zhytomyr

The Forpost is a local name for the IAI Searcher, which around 2010 was sold to Russia after being withdrawn and considered obsolete at least a decade before that. Actually, the replacement of the Searcher was already deemed obsolete and withdrawn from IAF service long before that. The deal was done with the approval of the US, and at a time of improved relations between the west and Russia. 
Italy and Russia had joint AFV programs, the US, UK and others were selling them electronics key to manufacturing Russia's domestic products, and France sold them everything from optics and electronics for their tanks and AFVs up to very nearly delivering them a helicopter carrier.

Israel was the only one of the bunch that sold long ago obsolete tech. After the conflict erupted in 2014, all parties ceased exports to Russia, and Russia had to develop its own drones to replace the Forpost eventually. Suffice to say their domestic products are of not so high quality.

**Why a bad thing**

Because the weapon systems were partially developed with US aid, bought by the US and its allies. Supposedly the US is the most important ally of Israel, the US (as Israel's most important ally) requested the transfer, but Israel blocked them. 

The war in Ukraine affects the US and its allies, but for Israel that is less important than the possible consequences of Russian retaliation (Syria and Iran).

genocidal monsters and both are burning in hell where they belong. Just like your comrade Putin will soon.

You admit appeasement doesn't work but demand Ukraine does that? You are a silly child. America would act the same if Mexico wanted to ally with Russia? You mean like how Venezuela is in a military pact with
Russia and America never invaded them? You are the first Vietnamese comedian I have met.

You say Germany should only care about Germany, not Ukraine. So by your logic America should only care about America, not Vietnam. It will be a cold day in hell before a communist slave dictates to the free world how to remain free.

Everybody dies someday, you and me too bud. You wish to die a quiet slave. I wish to die fighting to keep my freedom and for the freedoms of others. If my taxes are how it is done, so be it.

Americans will not fight in foreign wars? Lemme ask the WW1, WW2, and Korean war vets if Americans ever fought for a foreign country's freedom.

The first was that the Polish pilots kicked ass, in part because they didn't skip leg day.  They stressed a high level of physical fitness in order to maintain consciousness during high-g maneuvers.  When the British gave the Polish pilots the seven-g Spitfire, they came away with the highest number of aerial victories.

The next thing they noticed was that their World War I veterans couldn't keep up anymore.  Both sides had at least a dozen or so World War I veterans flying fighters and/or bombers.  Theo Osterkamp is the only one I remember right now.  But by 1940 even the youngest of them were pushing 40 and few had stayed in shape.  

I've read a lot of pilot biographies so it could have been Al Deere or Adolf Galland, or somewhere else where someone observed that it wasn't just overall fitness.  Older pilots were prone to losing consciousness sooner if the oxygen tailed or the mask fell away.  Their reaction times were slower.  They were more cautious and less inclined to randomly throw the plane around to evade pursuit.

If I remember right Britain had an upper combat age limit of 41 so they just started enforcing that more strictly on the pilots.  Senior German fliers were mostly promoted out of flying missions.

Currency and recency certainly make a huge difference.

&gt; physical reaction time, ability to physically cope with high-g flying…

It's not obvious that any of this would make a difference; it depends on what shot them down.

If you're forced to fly in the ManPADS envelope, you may have no idea that a missile has been launched at you until it hits, especially in the case of a rear aspect shot against Su-34 which has a rather limited rearward view.

I get the sense that Russian fast jet losses are driven by strategic and doctrinal failures:

* ineffective SEAD / DEAD, 
* lack of large scale training precluding the use of large strike packages and [complex air operations](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-defence-systems/russian-air-force-actually-incapable-complex-air-operations), 
* insufficient and ineffective PGMs, and 
* a general tendency for [corruption](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/corruption-russian-armed-forces) to erode all the boring stuff that doesn't appear at airshows and parades, resulting in trucks with no tyres, aircraft with no ECM pods, ARMs which only work against western systems going into a war against legacy Soviet kit etc. etc. 

I suspect that what's actually happening is that the Russian air force doesn't have enough money to train all its pilots, so hours are allocated on a power law distribution favouring higher ranking officers. 

These more experienced people are then more likely to go into combat, and they are then being shot down in proportion to their exposure to risk because war is a team sport and individual proficiency can't really counter-act the issues listed above.

In this interpretation, the average age skews older because these older pilots face greater risk exposure (more time in the combat area, and possibly more demanding missions) as a result of a perception that their experience is protective (which—as articulated above—I doubt).",db8aeb79ced0d3c24b2ccfc3cc510b4dc6fb6b74,True,False,,,,,0,1653637936,,0,{},ia63abm,False,t3_uymh2n,False,False,t1_ia5g8ii,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uymh2n/9_out_of_31_rf_pilots_shot_down_over_ukraine_have/ia63abm/,1653637946,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653609136.0,

What are you talking about?? Did you skip history class? Both America and the USSR fought against Japan. But had America not use nukes on Japan, Russian troops would have swoopped in and took the credit first. After the 2 nukes, America occupied Japan for sometime and rewrote Japan's constitution, now Japan cannot have a conventional army :)))

Our fight during the war was against Japan, France and America. Amercia dropped 8 million tons of bomb on Indochia (more than those dropped by all warring nations in ww2 combined). The Americans loved their puppet in South Vietnam so much they even assassinated its president :))) And you Westerners keep blabbing about democracy and freedom. Life in your countries might be great, but you make it miserable for those who doesn't obey you. The West is just like Russia but richer.

Vietnam staying neutral does not mean being China's slave. What part of neutrality don't you understand. We will not succumb to China or America. Unless either side attack us, we won't break our neutral status. We fought our wars because it was our last resort, neutrality and appeasements didn't work. Ukraine went pro West, they've always tried to join NATO, they never tried neutrality, that's why Putin decided to invade. America would react the same way if Mexico for some reason want to join a military pact with Russia.

First you need to know where the target is on the map. Then you find a good spot on the map for your arty battery and move the battery to this spot. That'll be your firing position. Measure the distance on the map between your firing position and the target. Given the distance you can now calculate the elevation angle (ascension? don't know the correct English word) for your gun/launcher. You also need to take the type of ammo into account to correctly calculate the distance. And also weather conditions. Usually, the battery commander has a pre-calculated table with all the values, so all he needs to do is to lookup the table and find the respective value.

Then you need to set the azimuth angle. For that you need to find a distinct landmark that you can clearly see in your surroundings and which you can also find on the map. On the map measure the angle between this landmark, your position, and the target. Now on the gun/launcher there is an optical eyesight that you can use to point it to the chosen landmark. Rotate the gun/launcher until the angle between it and the landmark is the same as you've measured on the map. 

Provided you did these steps with as much precision as possible, and your gun/launcher stands firmly on the ground, you'll hit the target with certain high degree of reliability.

Today, most of those measurements and calculations are done by hand-held artillery computers. Just point the target on the map, choose your landmark and the computer will calculate the angle for you.",7fc714f91f98266a4e175915742b876aa16cab53,True,False,,,,,0,1653636540,,0,{},ia61q1g,False,t3_uyqha0,False,True,t1_ia5zvah,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyqha0/ukrainian_soldiers_firing_at_enemy_positions_in/ia61q1g/,1653636553,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653607740.0,

What you have to understand is critics are criticising both EU and India( much less) on it's dependency of russian oil. It isn't a competition where one is criticised more and the other is a little lesser. 

india is buying oil doubling it's import when ukrainians are dying everyday. There's no doubt about it.

5057,[],False,,holgerschurig,,,[],,,,text,t2_3edl7,False,False,"&gt; You didn’t answer why your government is refusing to send weapons that manufacturers have literally sitting ready for Ukraine?

I cannot answer this question, because this question is unspecific. What weapon exactly do you mean?

Many reddit armchair generals say that Germany doesn't send the 7 PzH2000. This is the most weird accussation:

* the PzH2000 are already owned by Ukraine
* the paperwork for PzH2000 is already done, by both legislative (defence committee of the parliament) and executive (chancellor)

So why aren't they yet in Ukraine?  Simple: to protect them against russian missiles.

* currently UA artillery servicemen are trained in Idar-Oberstein on using them
* currently UA maintenance serviceman are trained in Aachen on how to maintain/repair them

Without people knowing how to handle the weapans, it makes zero sense to put the weapons into Ukraine. I'm sure the russians track them and attack them with a missile. So when they are there, the weapons must constantly move.

&gt; My point is the gas

Yeah, and?  Germany reduced gas import from Russia from 55% before the war to now 35%. This might not sound too much too you. And morally it's not as good as a Baltic country that says ""We are now at 0%"". For sure.

But in cubic-metres, and also worth-wise, the german reduction is more than even that of Poland. Germany's reduction make a MUCH larger hole into the purse of russian oligarchs than Poland and Baltics.

Also, I still don't see from you any point about Turkey financing Russia via oil and gas. For example, if you combine the GDP of Turkey and Italy, you're still not at the GDP of Germany. But their oil/gas import from Russia is larger than that from Russia. So either you have a blind eye, or you don't factor in that some larger economy uses more resources.

&gt; but they willingly gave up their nukes in agreement that they would be protected

Yes, and it was still a nutjob decision.

(I mean, if people accuse Germany that we should have had foresight and known in 1995 that Putin will become imperialistic, then the same applies for Ukraine)

&gt; You think Iran

They will never give up their atomic bombs --- because they have been misled MASSIVELY by the US. There was an agreement ""We give up the bomb plan, you stop the sanctions"". And Iran did do it's part. All of europes secret services said so, and also the IAEO. And Europe started to lift the sanctions. But the US pressured Europe to not do that, they ignored their own agreement. And as result there is zero trust anymore in Iran. On top of it factor in that the Iran government is 70% religious nutjobs, full of hate against Sunnites and Jews. And that some of their neighbors aren't better, full of hate against Shiites and Jews ...

North Korea also will not give up their plans.

5067,[],False,,Longsheep,,,[],,,,text,t2_j3mzo,False,False,"&gt; A 120mm depleted uranium shells is still going to ruin your day, regardless of the tank's age.

The turret frontal armor of the Leopard 2A4 is 400-500mm RHAe which can be penetrated by newer Russian rounds like 3BM46/3BM44M. The A5/6/7 have upgraded significantly (over 800 RHAe) which is currently believed to be protected against all Russian tank rounds except the Armata's, which hasn't seen combat yet. The 2PL upgrade puts it somewhat between the two.


&gt; Because it's actully the ammo, that matters.

The Leopard 2A4 has the L/44 short barrel gun that has around 15% less penetration compared to the L/55 gun on the A6 model they are trying to buy, when firing the same ammo (DM63). The US version of the gun is short barreled, but it can make up the difference by using advanced ammo such as M829A4.


&gt; Especially as M1 uses the same freaking gun as early Leopard 2

The M1 uses the 1986 M256 gun which started out as the mid-production Leopard 2 gun that is also what Germany is trying to give to Poland (A0-A5 variants). Which again tells how cheap Germany's offering is. The M256 now have the additional advantage of being able to use US ammo designed to make up the weakness of shorter barrel. Either gun should penetrate any Russian tank short of T-90M and Armata though. Even easier if from the sides or rear.

In that case, the US should give me and others billions of aid. I, and I am sure the others, will promise to spend the money buying US products if that helps the US economy.

And concerning the weapons, it's also proven that Israel aided Russian military, passed US tech to China, and blocked transfer of weapons that ARE in US inventory and its allies to Ukraine. Eg the Iron Dome that was developed with US aid.

Concerning anti-terrorism, I think that's vague. It's however proven that Israeli tools helped dictatorships to hunt dissidents. Eg the famous Khashoggi case who was tortured and killed by the Saudis.

Seriously though, Easterners like you have colonized and terrorized other nations before the West put a stop to your bullying. I'll remind you to remain ""neutral"" when China invades and annexes Vietnam. On that note, if China invaded Vietnam how would you feel if you were

Why you afraid of a nuclear war? You chickenshit or something? It's only mutual destruction if you let the other side fire off a shot. So why do you care if we Westerners are unafraid of nuclear war? That's our business, not yours. Westerners are braver than Easterners because we are willing to risk everything to keep our freedom. That is why Eastern nations like Vietnam were colonized instead of them colonizing the West. 

Fortunately the West realized how immoral colonies and empires are, so we chose to atone for those sins and no longer do that, unlike Russia. If Vietnam had anything valuable, Russia would have annexed Vietnam long ago.

You need to prepare Vietnam for when China annexes you. (Just kidding, the West will save you guys again).",ccc4f54d73c89c6dc45d1f25ac7cf638a165645a,True,False,,,,,0,1653628583,,0,{},ia5rb2m,False,t3_uxq92s,False,True,t1_ia5gruv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxq92s/ukrainian_presidential_adviser_on_concessions_to/ia5rb2m/,1653628597,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653599783.0,

We largely control their ability to wage war however, we can advise them of the realities and the better decisions to make. Ceding the DonBass to Russia wouldn’t effect the daily life of the average Ukrainian at all because the DonBass hasn’t been Ukrainian for the last 8 years; that’s why there’s been ~14,000 dead and another 30,000 wounded Ukrainians fighting over it. Now add the horrific casualty numbers they’re enduring now and it’s just a total waste. 

To answer your questions:

1) How much are the Ukrainians willing to sacrifice? That depends on what they’re being told. This entire sub has been celebrating a victory for the last 60 days. If Ukrainians or anyone else for that matter, thinks they can win, they’ll fight. Tell them the truth instead of letting them find out like these guys:
[example](https://twitter.com/timand2037/status/1528730913982631936?s=20&amp;t=op9sudZVxDTlRoDNfYQ05Q)

Nope, Poland send all kinds of T-72 they have, including the T-72M1R which are fresh out of factory from a full upgrade. The thermal FCS system they have received costs more than a T-72 on the arms market. It can spot Russian tanks first which is very important.

Poland is only planning to replace their T-72 because US finally agreed to supply them Abrams last year. Before that they were modernizing all T-72 and Leopard 2A4 they own.


&gt; Germany offered intermediate replacement now and upgrade later, but the polish government want all 200 of them.

The last article only suggested that Poland was asking for ""something like the A6 or newer"", which is 15 years old and currently the oldest active-service tank in Bundeswehr. Poland do not want the Leopard 2A4 offered to Czech because they are outdated and have always been available. Poland has a fleet of it that is undergoing update.

The problem is that the update packages are all either too expensive or constantly seeing delays.

It's risky because they might believe we still have tactical nukes, and I wouldn't blame them for assuming we do.  If there's an American-made missile that could carry a tactical nuke coming at the Russians, we have to trust that they won't retaliate with an actual nuke by mistake.

When you say that “The world is a hard cruel place that requires leaders to make hard decisions”, I agree, I just believe that you think the “hard” choice is to keep having Ukrainians slaughtered senselessly.

The real “hard choice” that acknowledges the cruelty of the world, is that the DonBass is gone. Ukraine doesn’t have an endless supply of men nor equipment and if you haven’t noticed, the world economy is starting a nose dive. So all those friends and allies will look towards their own polling numbers very soon. All those Euros paying rubles for gas should be an indicator of the economic realities. And military realities dictate that you live to fight another day, there’s nothing noble in bravery wasted.

Lastly, Vietnam is a poor comparison for you here, as North Vietnam was never invaded by the US. Had the US decided to use their entire weight and march on Hanoi, that would have been a very different outcome. As for their resilience, they didn’t have to go through what Ukraine is enduring and they went to the negotiating table as soon as the US used “Maximum Effort” and had the “12 days of Christmas” bombing that went after Hanoi and Haiphong harbor. If anything it makes my point…even the incredibly tough N.Vietnamese knew they couldn’t withstand the full force of a major power and correctly accepted a settlement. And then got what they wanted later, just as Ukraine should do.

There’s a quote from the Vietnamese peace negotiations that you should know because it shows both the truth of that war and the reality that victory can come in many ways. There’s no reason to beat your head against a wall and mistake that for bravery.

“You know, you never defeated us on the battlefield,' Col. Summers said. 'That may be so,' Col.

If Zelensky wants help, he better not be a dick to another country's president. America and its allies helped Europe not out of good will, but to get rid of competion. America and USSR both want a unipolar world with themselves at the top, but Nazi Germany is gaining too much power so the Allies joined forces to take down a common enemy. If they fought Hitler purely because he was mass murdering Jews, the West wouldn't have sanctioned Vietnam for doing the same with Pol Pot. Vietnam defeated the genocide regime of Pol Pot and got sanctioned by the West. Again, it's every man for himself, people will help if they can see their own benefit in helping.

I' Vietnamese. My country was colonized be France for 100 years, then the Japanese came just to make things worse. The Soviet bloc helped us so we are greatful for them, and them alone, but most of the war effort was done by Vietnamese and we didn't rely solely on our allies. But we know that their choice to help was to expand their influence to counter Western influence in Indochina. After 1954, the Americans intervene and caused another 20 years of war. That's why we know the West doesn't care about freedom or democracy, they only care for their own power, and i get it, i'd done the same thing had i been in their positions. 

Look at it from a real life scenario. There are alot of poor people all around the globe. How much money and effort are you will to give to help those people? Are you willing to suffer major financial inconvenience to donate to the poor? There must be a limit cause you still have to take care of yourself, right? Same thing with Germany, high gas price would hurt its economy, lots of people may lose their jobs, or find it extremely hard to stay afloat. Have you consider that yet? Or because supporting Ukraine is trendy so everyone must help Ukraine? Even if Germans must be thankful, they're not gonna be thankful to Ukraine. Ukraine didn't help them financially after the war. Ukraine put Stepan Bandera- a Nazi as its national hero, many Ukrainians in the past even collaborated with the Nazis. Large portion of Ukraine's land was given to them by Russia and the USSR.

The *Strategic* Petroleum Reserve is oil that has already been pumped from the ground and placed into long term storage so it can be rapidly pumped into pipelines to deal with very short term disruptions of imported oil and/or world markets.

When full it is about 700 million barrels.

We pump out of the ground most recently about 12 million barrels a day.  8 million of that is exported, and 8 million other barrels are imported.  (It's cheaper for us to refine certain crude oils, other countries find it cheaper to refine ours -- anything from technology to simply we may import Mexican oil to Texas to refine while shipping Alaskan oil to Japan for them to refine.)

At times in our past, like when the SPR was created, we relied more heavily on imports.  As cheap middle eastern oil has become not so cheap, production shifted back to the US.

US Proven Petroleum Reserves -- what has been located and is estimated to be economically viable to pump from the ground is currently about 40 Billion barrels; that's up 5 Billion barrels over the last 5 years or so as new discoveries are made and economics fluctuate.

&gt; *American operations in the Persian Gulf war showed such a stunning integration of high-technology reconnaissance and furious strike forces that* ***Soviet military analysts concluded their armed forces would be behind for years.***  
&gt;  
&gt; *The Soviet report makes frequent and envious references to America's ''reconnaissance-strike'' complex, by which satellites, airborne radars, electronic systems, attack aircraft, cruise missiles, naval gunfire and ground artillery weapons were thoroughly integrated to conduct sustained attacks on the length and breadth of Iraq`s defenses.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *As an example, the Soviet report said that the Americans were able to detect Scud missile launches within 30 seconds.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *''The proficiency of the responsive strikes'' testified to the effectiveness of the unprecedented integration of reconnaissance and strike systems, the report said.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Indeed, it characterized the gulf conflict as a proving ground for the weapons of the 21st Century: ''The U.S. accomplished the practical testing of reconnaissance-strike complexes for employment of precision weapons . . . under combat conditions.''*  
&gt;  
&gt; *It went on to say that the ''U.S. military-industrial complex'' is now refining the performance of those systems to ensure continued supremacy.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *The repeated references in the Soviet report to America's new ''reconnaissance-strike'' capability led an American military officer to remark, ''It's obvious that we have it, they don't have it, and they don't like it.''*  
&gt;  
&gt; *The Soviet report also gave high marks to the U.S. effort to fool the Iraqis into thinking an amphibious invasion would take place on the coast of Kuwait, and it also credited the effectiveness of American jamming and other electronic warfare techniques in blinding and confusing the Iraqi defenses.*

(and if any of their numbers are exaggerated, those are it, as there's a far larger discrepancy between visually-confirmed downed aircraft and claimed ones than for ground vehicles, Oryx counts about half as many tanks and armored vehicles as Ukraine does but only a 7th as many planes and a quarter as many helicopters)

Russia is not expecting a ground any time soon and can commit a majority of their army and VDV combat units without compromising their own defense too much, which they've also done. Protecting their seas and airspace are a different matter. They still need to patrol their airspace and waters, and are still doing so. Most of their Navy and Air Force units are _not_ being used in Ukraine.  

I don't think the fact that they're using older pilots and retired mercenary ones means they're 'running out of pilots' but merely that they're not prepared to compromise their airspace by sending that many of their active-duty pilots to the fight and instead enticing reservists to re-enlist (which they've been doing across the board) and sending those.",5dab7cfd20142c77c75a2bba8f7e99ee9507d226,True,False,,,,,0,1653617139,,0,{},ia56lfm,False,t3_uymh2n,False,True,t3_uymh2n,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uymh2n/9_out_of_31_rf_pilots_shot_down_over_ukraine_have/ia56lfm/,1653617155,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653588339.0,

I cannot underline this enough. By no means is Russia going to collapse (they have more than enough fuel and food and other goods to live, if a bit less with Western luxury goods), but unless it normalizes ties with the West ASAP, it WILL begin deindustrialize. 

It's already happening with their modern tank/airline industry: there are simply too many parts that they literally cannot make OR afford to buy parts and the engineers and scientists  to make the factories NEEDED to replace those missing parts (kind of a problem when all your smart people run away because war is bad actually and all your young men are dying in a war). Think about WW2, when *gasp* women had to work in factories. THAT was a war time economy. I don't think Russia has the capacity nor the incentive to make the heart of the empire (Moscow and St Petersburg) actually think this war is THAT dire. 

Every day that sanctions are in place, Russia must make the hard decision to either white-knuckle the sanctions or beginning the process of native industrialization, which is need a lot of time, needs a lot of smart people, needs a lot of money, needs a lot of planning, and needs a lot of people who won't siphon federal funds for their own personal slush funds.

&gt; Sputnik/Ramil Sitdikov/Kremlin via REUTERS.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comMay 26 - Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of country, bordering Ukraine.

&gt; &amp;quot;A new front has opened and we can&amp;#039;t fail to pay attention to it,&amp;quot; Lukashenko, wearing military uniform, told a televised meeting of defence officials.

&gt; Belarus said earlier this month it planned to deploy special operations troops in three areas near the border with Ukraine, as Lukashenko talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country&amp;#039;s defences.

&gt; A top Russian official threw cold water on revived peace talks with Ukraine, sharply dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&amp;#039;s demand that Russia withdraw all troops from Ukraine&amp;#039;s borders.

&gt; Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, on Thursday called Zelensky&amp;#039;s demand &amp;quot;To the point of idiocy and unfeasible in principle.&amp;quot; Medvedev&amp;#039;s remarks, which were delivered in a lengthy Telegram post, come a day after Zelensky reiterated he would not cede any territory to Russia in order to wind down the three-month-old conflict.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month he wouldn&amp;#039;t agree to a peace deal unless Ukraine agreed to &amp;quot;Solve the issues of Crimea and Donbas,&amp;quot; creating what&amp;#039;s so far been an insurmountable sticking point with Zelensky.

Fields are not swamps, fields are cultivated lands.  Might be pastures if you just let domestic animals keep them grazed even if mechanical equipment would get mired.

No.  Cars yes, tracked vehicles not so much.

You need to get well under 20psi on tractor tires to match the ground pressure of a typical tracked vehicle.  

For tractors the size/age I've seen towing tanks, that is going to likely be triple rear tires to support enough weight at a low enough psi to be useful.  Newer US large tractors will be using either double very wide tires, or extremely large single tires.

In this case, when handing a system to a foreign military who only had a few weeks to train on it, you want the system to be as simple and easy to repair as possible. More automation and more complex systems like autoloader mean more probabilities of mechanical problems, and harder to repair (in particular since ukr mechanics aren't familiar with these art systems).

That also contribute to make them heavier (archer is 30t vs caesar's 18t, tho it pale in comparison to the Phz unwieldy 55t), and thus a biger logistical burden, in a context where ukraine's logistics are already strained.

Archer is a beast and would be extremely useful, but all in all a less automated system like for the caesar is probably the most optimal for this situation.",15f6aaf37de9e285f4a1ff4fae0a00bb614f4a91,True,False,,,,,0,1653616523,,0,{},ia55bq0,False,t3_uyaj6z,False,True,t1_ia3kmqq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyaj6z/with_the_m777_and_caesar_two_of_the_four/ia55bq0/,1653616539,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653587723.0,

Back then, he massively underestimated the North Vietnamese people’s will to unify their country. Today, he has massively underestimated the sacrifices the Ukrainians are willing to make to retake their territory. 

Putin will not be able to “declare victory” and move on any more than we were able negotiate a true lasting armistice with either North Vietnam or the Taliban. Kissinger claims to adhere to realpolitik, yet he habitually fails to recognize its central tenant: politics is the study of the possible. Saying the Ukrainians should cut their losses and settle for peace is not something they are willing to do. So advocating for it is absurd and a waste of time. Saying negotiation is the “realistic” option isn’t realism at all.  What it actually is is another example of the condescending narcissism that is so common in people who claim to be realists but lack the intestinal fortitude to actually accept that the world is a hard, cruel place that requires leaders to make hard decisions. 

This is a four-year war, minimum (though the Ukrainians will be quick to tell you that means it’s a 12-year war minimum). The fact of the matter is an attempt to “negotiate” out of this will just cause more needless suffering. War is hell and a lot of people are going to suffer and die over the next few years. But trying to clean our hands of this will just leave the Ukrainians to suffer and die alone.

and the true state of affairs is horrific try to fool themselves.  They think ""our   
president must not be aware of the real situation.""  The   
alternative,that putin is a delusional psychopath, is so terrifying they  
cannot not allow themselves to believe what they already know about ""their  
president"".  In Stalin's USSR days all peasants believed that none   
of their suffering would have been permitted if only ""Uncle Joe"" Stalin knew   
the truth.   In Germany they believed the suffering of the German People  
 would not have been permitted if only someone had just told Herr Hitler  
 the truth.  In all three cases, it's self induced insanity on a   
cultural and national scale.  Can they wake up in time?  History shows   
that is not likely.

Read the update the author made when he was being criticised regarding the 'analysis'.

Can you just do that one thing for me? Then you might feel silly but it's necessary you ACTUALLY READ YOUR OWN SOURCE.

FROM YOUR OWN SOURCE:

""UPDATE 12/11: Based on the feedback of many people whose work I respect quite a bit, I wanted to explicitly lay out a few caveats to the above analysis. First, this piece is intended as a fun thought experiment, not a definitive ranking, or a scholarly contribution to the field of military history. I believe some of the results from this project, especially Lee and Rommel, provide interesting data points for broader discussions of their tactical abilities. In no way do I claim my analysis provides the full picture, or anything close to it.  
Furthermore, since I rely heavily on Wikipedia for data and the categorization of that data, there are holes and inconsistencies in my inputs. Given my personal lack of resources, it is implausible for me to conduct a project of this scale while checking the precision of each and every data point.  
Finally, I must reiterate that my ranking is of a general’s tactical value added, not their overall strategic abilities, or who would win in a hypothetical head-to-head with equalized troops and equipment.  
Again, I believe the vast majority of readers interpreted this piece as I intended — a thought experiment with interesting results and entertaining interactivity. Thank you to everyone that has read the piece and/or provided feedback.""

They decidedly were *not* mobilized. That was part of why the Nazis saw such initial success - the Soviet forces were not prepared to fight *at all*.

&gt; Nope. Stalin planned to 1941 from the start.

According to Vladimir Rezun, based on *zero* hard evidence and with the circumstantial evidence being *extremely* tenuous (and that's generous). But even eminent historians on relevant subjects like David Glantz dismiss the claim completely.

&gt; There is always ongoing reorganization.

The Red Army was in the process of completely replacing basically all of their equipment, from tanks (with the new T-34s and KV-1s just entering production) to rifles (the SVT-40 entering service) to other small arms (like the PPSh-41) to heavier infantry weapons (like the PTRS-41 and DShK), and barely half of their mostly-obsolete tank force was even *functional*.

Plus the purge was *still going on in 1941* - they had *no experienced senior officers to speak of*. The state of readiness in the Red Army was absolute shit and they had just had that lesson drummed into them by the Winter War: there is no way for them to have not known.

Every single piece of actual evidence suggests their strategic planning wouldn't entail a major war for a substantial amount of time.

&gt; Stalin didn't want to believe that Germany would open the second front by itself with a preemptive strike from severe numerical disadvantage

Sure, it was an obviously stupid strategic decision on an unimaginable scale so you wouldn't expect a competent enemy to make such a dumb decision... but it would also be an major catastrophe for the USSR so it's easy to see how even a paranoid tyrant like Stalin wouldn't want it to happen while they were still unprepared for that war.

&gt; In fact Hitler later on admitted to Mannerheim that had he known how many heavy equipment Soviets had in 1941 right behind the border he would not have attacked USSR.

That was because the Nazis had grossly underestimated how many tanks the Soviets had built, period. Nothing to do with preparations for any particular military operations, they just had bad intelligence estimates based more on ideology than actual evidence.",576f5328cce531a2e714c109b8c9559e24986834,True,False,,,,,0,1653611824,,0,{},ia4vpdk,False,t3_uydy7u,False,True,t1_ia4rnnq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uydy7u/lavrov_in_tass_data_uncovered_during_the_russian/ia4vpdk/,1653611841,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653583024.0,

&gt;One German official suggested that the row with Warsaw might be linked to the fact that Poland wants better tanks from Germany: While the Leopard 2A4 that the Czech Republic is receiving was built in the late 1980s and has partly been upgraded since, Poland has expressed interest in more modern versions of the tank such as the Leopard 2A6, the official said.

Poland was interested in newer variants, because it already upgrades their trashy 2A4 fleet to a newer standard in a pain-in-the-ass process that is not only cost inefficient but already takes years and would take another 10 years to finalize with a new batch.
