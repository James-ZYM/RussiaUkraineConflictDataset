&gt;Speaking in a U.S. radio interview on Thursday, Pompeo said: “Taiwan has not been a part of China”.
&gt;
&gt;“That was recognised with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades,” he said.

More specifically, Mike Pompeo was referencing point 5 [Reagan's Six Assurances](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/six-assurances-1982/), which assured Taiwan that opening diplomatic relations with the PRC does not change its position of sovereignty over Taiwan.:

&gt;The second cable, sent on August 17, 1982, from then U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz to then AIT Director Lilley, offers six assurances to Taiwan, reinforcing the message above.  The United States:

* Has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan
* Has not agreed to consult with the PRC on arms sales to Taiwan
* Will not play a mediation role between Taipei and Beijing
* Has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act
* **Has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan.**
* Will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC.

The Six Assurances were affirmed and reaffirmed by Congress multiple times, and the current administration continues to say the Six Assurances are a fundamental part of the US-Taiwan relationship. This is why if you listen to the State Department statements, they say things along of the lines of the US Taiwan policy is ""guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances"".

The State Department also clarified as recently as five days ago that the United States does not agree with the ""One China principle"" of the PRC: https://twitter.com/USA_China_Talk/status/1528235347057967109",54bc729f943298ec9b8fd5b2fc61b5b206c55392,True,False,,,,,0,1653509371,,0,{},i9z912m,False,t3_uxfpht,False,True,t1_i9z6fzu,/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/i9z912m/,1653509387,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653480571.0

[],False,,LizardChaser,,,[],,,,text,t2_ycbjmh9,False,False,"This analysis is blind to the immediate and existential crisis that China is beginning to face:   it's demography is completely upside down.  China doesn't have either the energy supplies or food supplies to sustain itself.  It is entirely an export economy driven by cheap labor--labor that must be cheap enough to ship all the necessary inputs (energy / raw materials) thousands of miles to get to China and then thousands of miles more to get to their intended markets.  It has a burgeoning consumer market but the consumer market is dependent on--consumers.  

China is facing at least 30 years of being completely upside down demographically.  They're bad in reported numbers and you know their reported numbers are wrong because you can see their labor costs have increased drastically. This is being sped up on both ends by China's failure to develop a working COVID vaccine.  Locking down entire cities, ports, and manufacturing areas makes them an unreliable partner.  Further, the already small population of Chinese who should be having kids aren't.  A demographic chart needs to be a pyramid not a martini glass.   

To be blunt, over the next 10 years you are going to see manufacturing flea China as labor costs skyrocket and their markets crash as they can neither drive their economy through exports or domestic consumption.  It's not extreme to wonder if they're going to have food security issues in the next 20 years.  

Contrast that with the U.S., who is both energy and food independent, and has a large young generation (millennials) who are also having kids.  The U.S. demographics look like a tower with a bulge (boomers) and a minaret (decay of the elderly).  The U.S. also is a destination for immigration and has always been able to supplement it's population through immigration.  In short, the U.S. does not have a demographic crisis.  Further, the U.S. is also close in proximity to lower cost labor.  We will likely see a significant shift in manufacturing that supports North American markets shift to Mexico and South America.  There they will be close to fuel, raw materials, low cost labor, and the intended markets.

[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"Given their past behavior, I think China is planning for a ""peaceful""  naval blockade of Taiwan by unarmed merchant marine vessels. The goal won't be to achieve total capitulation - they'll accept the minimal concessions that will allow them to say they've reunified the country before October's Congress. 

* ""One China"" policy recognizes that Taiwan is part of China. This makes Taiwan's coastal waters Chinese waters. So this would not be a clear-cut act of war the way an international blockade would usually be. 

* Taiwan imports &gt;80% of their food &amp; fuel. A successful blockade would starve them out well before October (when the seas become too stormy for small littoral vessels). 

China started their ""Civil Military Fusion"" of merchant vessels in 2014. This encompasses over 1M sailors/fishermen and 172k ships &amp; boats. Xi put himself in personal charge of this effort, which suggests he sees it as being of great strategic importance (reserve forces are typically low priority). 

China has used this ""peaceful"" approach on a small scale to achieve area denial around contested atolls and fishing grounds. Unarmed Chinese vessels will physically block the path of foreign ships, or surround them and make their passage impossible. 

Some other signs: 

* PRC passed a law last year requiring all Chinese vessels to stop [broadcasting their positions in Chinese waters](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/business/china-shipping-data-mic-intl-hnk/index.html). This allows them to conceal which ships are where to a certain extent (satellite imagery still works of course). 

* Fishing boats have been outfitted with devices to increase their radar signature. These are inflatable metal balloons or ""pop up"" structures. They allow cheap boats to appear to be more significant vessels, to soak up long-range anti-ship missiles. 

* China [has hoarded](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-05/one-reason-for-rising-food-prices-chinese-hoarding) a record amount of food stocks. They have over a year's supply of most cereals and grains. They are well prepared if the West attempts to cut off their imports. 

Their goal won't be to starve Taiwan out - Taiwan will be required to make concessions and then Beijing can directly provide the food and fuel they need. 

Taiwan can of course attempt to break the blockade by force, but they have no way to sink tens of thousands of boats. Any attempt to do so will look like an escalation, and China will claim the right to self-defense (some fishing boats can be provided with MANPADS). 

The US Navy is another force that could attempt to break the blockade, so we could see squadrons of F-35's attacking fleets of unarmed fishing boats. This will play well for China's propaganda campaign. China is not afraid to engage with the USN, but they will only do so in a ""self defense"" capacity. It works for China to see the images of defenseless Chinese boats being preyed on by the US, to no strategic effect. 

China's lockdowns have resulted in an unprecedented traffic jam of merchant marine traffic off China's coast. Nobody pays much attention to this because we see it as evidence of China's stupidity. They see the West as arrogant, and are happy to play into that role. 

The US I think has belatedly recognized what the play is.

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"Question though: If these Fulani herders are already transient and have shown a desire to violate borders to carry out attacks, how will officially declaring a border solve the issue? It is not as though the Fulani's main goal is to force the Christians into obeying the Nigerian state as was the case in the Sudanese Crisis. Their desire is more primal, a drive for resources and the means to exploit them by taking control of the producers. Northern Nigeria is dry, little in way of the necessities of life, and will only become drier as Desertification and Climate Change take its toll. These desires cannot possibly vanish just because you create a new arbitrary line in the sand. If the Christians cannot defend themselves now, then if independence happens how can they be expected to fend against the motivated attackers? Even in Sudan's case we see that South Sudan is completely incapable of preventing Sudan from taking over Abyei and Kafia Kingi for resource exploitation. Sudan would likely have barreled deeper were it not for the SPLA's proven military record. Nor indeed did partition fix anything for those trapped on the wrong side of the line, with SPLM-N still fighting on. Moreover its not like the Christians are all united either, and I am certain the Igbos would want to resurrect Biafra should partition become a possibility. What will you do when these communities in turn start feuding?

Realistically there is  not much the international community could do. They cannot charge the government for intent because the government is not the main party perpetrating the genocide, though one can argue that Buhari's silence is enabling the violence. They could of course prod the government into trying to take action, but with Nigeria's layers of bureaucracy it would take forever for action to materialise, if it could take effect at all with Nigeria's shortage of funds. Nigeria's governmental silence becomes non-mysterious if you consider that Nigeria wants to  prevent Biafra 2.0 at any cost and will silence any indications of ethnic conflict to avoid polarising the population. Could the West target the individual militias? Well in theory yes, but that would expend a lot of resources to solve what is ultimately Nigeria's own problem. This would not be good from a national perspective of wanting to maximise benefit for one's own country. Plus, how exactly can one apprehend attackers if they can just melt away into the general population after an attack? Or if as your sources suggest, government collusion is involved? It would be extremely difficult to find the perpetrators, never mind bringing them to justice. 

To me Nigeria reminds me of India. Huge, polyethnic systems with flawed governance that stay together because the systems of relationships between people that make it less palatable to outright desire independence. Hence just like India there is a smorgasbord of sepraratist movements that have not really met the meteoric success they might have hoped for. Nigeria  survived decades of Muslim authoritarian domination so at this point its likely they might hold together pending some extreme destabilisation. Fundamentally I think the separatist argument that Nigeria's borders are arbitrary overlooks the fact that all borders are arbitrary, people just decide on who is or is not the in-group that should have a nation. People might not like the Nigerian system, but they can still feel a sense of attachment to the idea of a nationwide community that persists in spite of it. They mingle with people of other backgrounds and form social bonds which leads them to feel a part of a more cohesive whole. This is why separatist outreach to their own ethnicities has not yielded enough success to warrant them being treated as the legitimate representative of their people, so the international community at large is not beholden to treat such requests seriously even if humanitarianism were a priority. 

There's also the point where Nigerian forces would not agree to such a solution being forced on them, because nobody would without a compelling reason. As long as Nigeria has the dominant power any partition would remain theoretical and hardly address the real situation on the ground.",67c94928296075257076fd1dc09dcc643d4346f2,True,False,,,,,0,1653482301,,0,{},i9xf7cb,False,t3_urt9c6,False,True,t3_urt9c6,/r/geopolitics/comments/urt9c6/will_there_ever_be_any_geopolitical_reaction_to/i9xf7cb/,1653482319,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653453501.0

Oh yeah, I'm sure that would've gone over well politically in America.

""Troops being redeployed to Afghanistan, will Biden actually pull out?"" Even then, 5k troops is nothing. Not even close to enough to hold a city as large as Kabul. You'd need to deploy way more troops. A ""surge"" of troops if you will, and then you'd need to pull those troops out too, which just gets right back to the same problem.

&gt; Lastly, they abandoned a key air base (Bagram) which would have provided all the air support they needed.

Which would be pretty meaningless, air support without ground power means you're only harassing. And with the Taliban inside the city it would be impossible to force them out.

&gt; Honestly any show of force would have stalled the Taliban’s advance.

This is like, peak armchair general.

No, there wasn't really anything to stall the Taliban after the ANA collapsed.

&gt; As I see it, there were two ways to have done this: renegotiate the Doha deal to make withdrawal explicitly conditional on an intra-Afghan agreement, as Biden was well within his rights to do as a new president;

This would basically mean an indefinite extension of the occupation of Afghanistan (extremely unpopular domestically) PLUS America would be breaking its diplomatic word, further undermining any future agreement.

No. Once Trump said we were pulling out, you can't get that genie back in the bottle. It's out there.

&gt;  put maximum pressure on the Taliban and the Ghani government to compromise. The Biden administration could have set the wheels for this in motion after the election in November 2020. For both options, our presence in Afghanistan was the leverage we needed.

With what? Taliban doesn't care. Nothing except a full reoccupation is going to faze them. 

We didn't have *any* leverage. Taliban can just wait us out while applying minimal pressure since they know Biden going back on Trump's pledge would be wildly unpopular.

&gt; Time was not on Biden’s side here. But the administration lost precious time in undertaking an Afghanistan policy review. Then, in March, the State Department announced a moonshot attempt at diplomacy, and in April Biden announced an entirely unconditional withdrawal, which threw out the conditions Trump’s Doha deal had negotiated without even giving the Biden administration’s own attempt at diplomacy a chance.

The Doha deal was literally dead before Trump even left office, Taliban didn't care about it. Everyone knew it. 

Biden tried the moonshot attempt sure, but it was always unlikely to succeed. So Biden does the best he can, try to get Americans out of Afghanistan without immediately revealing that the ANA is a paper tiger. He starts a phased withdrawal, pulling basically everyone outside of Kabul out. And then the Taliban kicked in the door.

The fact that Biden managed to get all Americans and thousands of refugees out of Afghanistan in a major airlift effort and only a couple people died is like a minor miracle. It easily could've been hundreds of Americans  and thousands Afghanis dead in street to street fighting at Kabul.",3d08704a61c9448f6b9ceaa682048d5fa8bf1aa4,True,False,,,,,0,1653447463,,0,{},i9w1ipd,False,t3_uwtlup,False,True,t1_i9vwrbm,/r/geopolitics/comments/uwtlup/how_to_make_bidens_free_world_strategy_work_its/i9w1ipd/,1653447479,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653418663.0

That's the clearly the symptom and not the root cause.
You might believe that but if you don't believe in yourself or your ideas who will? People feel that don't have any power because they tell themselves that their choice doesn't matter but choices do matter. How we present ourselves and the messages we tell ourselves affect our perceptions of the world. Everyone's looking for a savior but nobody wants to take the time or effort to take responsibility for themselves.To be disciplined, to question 

Look up Egoism literally every idea word and concept philosophy, poltical ideology, religion came from individuals. Islam came from Mohammed, Buddhism from Siddartha Gautama, Confucinism from Confucius. Power lies with people based on the choices we make. Individual power is limited hence why people make coalitions and NG and IGO's governments are human constructs. They come from people.

We're seeing right in front of our eyes why the founding fathers wanted separation of church and state. Because there's a group of people that feel they need to be the morality police and control what people do with their bodies. Except it's not the governments place or the churches to tell people what we do with our bodies. 


&gt;There's no evidence for this.

No the GOP just spends tons of money on sc8ence textbooks that teach creationism instead of critical thinking skills and empirical analysis for no reason.

&gt;the consent of the governed. Thus, an authoritarian government can also fulfill the social contract.

Aka people. we give up absolute freedom so that so called inalienable rights life freedom are protected by institutions- governments 

&gt;Do they?

They do.

&gt;Most people have to ""sit on the sidelines"" and follow the lead of those in positions of leadership, otherwise collective action would be impossible.


That doesn't mean they shouldn't question where those leaders are taking them. It's called the fallacy of the masses for a reason. 

&gt;Only a minority of people are able to do that, and then on a good day. Most people fall back on heuristics such as party labels, or what their peer group values.


Which just illustrates why education and therfore the ability to make informed decisions is important. Parties are embodiments and representations of ideals. It's why symbolism is ultimately dangerous because we use labels to try and quantify  complex concepts when we need to be clear and concise about what we mean instead of abstraction.

Look at sayings that get shortened like: A few bad apples. The full saying is a few bad apples spoils the bunch.

A jack of all trades and a master of none. It sounds like an insult but the full saying is a jack of all trades and a master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Thus, an authoritarian government can also fulfill the social contract.

&gt;People put way too much blind faith in authority and tradition.

Do they?

&gt;We don't have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines and passively accepting everything our leaders tell us.

Most people have to ""sit on the sidelines"" and follow the lead of those in positions of leadership, otherwise collective action would be impossible.

&gt;Authority should always be questioned and scrutinized

Only a minority of people are able to do that, and then on a good day. Most people fall back on heuristics such as party labels, or what their peer group values.

&gt;just because somethings is a tradition doesn't mean it's good for us.

True.
