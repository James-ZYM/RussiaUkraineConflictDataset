One of the main issues encountered when developing these fleets is the torque produced by the electric motors which can go from 0-full power almost instantaneously. This is very different from traditional engines which take much longer to come to full power. The result was a lot of the mechanical parts which came from diesel designs had to be re-engineered because things like drive shafts were snapping in two (or being bent beyond recognition) from the instant max torque. Yes they could have buffered the power with some sort of regulator but it kind of took away one of the advantages of instant start/stop.

From day 1, my military has trained me to fight against a doctrinal enemy facsimile to the RAF. Through each rank, from basic officer training through to platoon, company and battalion levels, I have studied and prepared for a possible confrontation with an enemy similar to the RAF. I have had their doctrine beaten over the head countless until I can religiously quote their order of battle, formations, dispositions, weapon ranges, capabilities and their doctrinal actions. 

  
The Russian incursion into Ukraine has been nothing short of a clusterfuck.   
How the hell did they fail to secure the airspace? Why did they advance on 7 fronts simultaneously instead of weighting a main effort with secondary efforts to support the main? Why are their lines of communications so shoddy? Where are their 2nd echelon troops to establish forward operating bases so their soldiers can re-arm, refuel and refit? Why did they allow their actual strategic battle map to be displayed on Belarusian television?  

  
Even the most basic things that would give any half decent sergeant worthy of their stripes a heart attack. Vehicle interiors strewn with rubbish, soldiers looting fuel stations, indiscriminate firing into non-combatants, strategic level weapon systems left unguarded in Ukrainian fields, battlefield comms across unsecure nets, MREs that expired 7 years ago. 

  
Is this really the âenemyâ that I spent my entire career preparing for? This is not one or two tactical level officers fucking up. This is the result of years of deep systemic issues allowed to fester in the core of the Russian military. They are a 3rd rate military riding on the coat tails of their WW2 and Cold War heritage. 

What the fuck happened? I donât know if itâs corruption, nepotism or just plain hubris, but the best thing to come out of this war is the world gets to find out that the Russian Armed Forces is a joke. Go home Putin, you played your hand and you lost.

How is joining to defensive alliance is a threat to Russia (not taken that Russia is threatening everyone around for wanting to join the alliance)?

Russia has made alternative route of gas pipeline (nordstream-2) and would have had it's gas piped to Europe evading Ukraine (but not anymore as it made clear threat to Europe by invading Ukraine).

Crisis in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk obviously was called out by Russians saying that Ukrainians are committing crimes against Russians in those regions (I can neither confirm nor agree that this was the case as there are a lot of clear propaganda from those regions, but I think all countries have their ultra-nationalists and several of these acts appear in all countries even your ""motherland""). Also Russia sent its troops to those regions furthermore escalating the conflict in that region to something that looks like war. If you're Russian, you live in other country you don't try to take those lands from that country you live in and try to make it independent or try to integrate it to Russia, you move back to Russia (it's like saying that Russian people who live in America, should make those areas they live in independent countries, like land of Donetskmerica or Amerikahansk, and try to integrate those lands to Russia).

Normal population to fight, Ukrainians know they are fighting the Russian occupants and they are fighting for their freedom (freedom of free speech and well being) and I think most of them are fighting voluntarily. 

I think that all those military units that as you say ""help"" Ukrainians know that invading another country just to establish dictatorship is wrong and they want to prevent actions like these.

As for raiding I think you as many other people saw how Ukrainians line to visit stores and markets and as for raiding, raiding is just for Russians as there were many videos of them raiding stores.

And while they're fellow Europeans, there are still language and cultural differences between them. Syrian refugees are also engineers, doctors etc but were treated very differently, even though many European countries, and their respective military, had a hand in why they were refugees in the first place. The assumption that it's inherently SO much easier to integrate Ukrainians instead of other people is part of the problem black and brown people are discussing. The simple belief that it's true, even if it's not based on anything empirical, is the problem itself.

2.  ""Israel isn't a global threat, so people don't feel like they need to unite to defeat it. And Arabs aren't popular with a lot of people who associate them with 9/11, the Taliban, ISIS, or any of the other backwards head-chopping savages in the middle east."" 

Yeah, but Russia isn't a global threat, for now at least, it's a Ukrainian threat. They haven't threatened or invaded anyone else right now. But the world is, rightfully so, galvanising against them IN SUPPORT OF UKRAINE. Ukrainians are the primary victims, and in that same regard Palestinians are the victims of Israel's annexing of territory, but it doesn't garner nearly the same kind of response. No one is sanctioning Israel or their billionaires or their sports teams but Palestinians have by every legal basis had their land and rights taken from them. And it happens because the world doesn't see their cause as something worth fighting for. ISIS and Taliban have nothing to do with Palestine, so again you're just highlighting an inherent bias. Also, ISIS and Taliban are a response to the destabilisation that those countries have faced in the middle-east after years of being invaded by US, EU military forces. They also don't represent the bulk of the people living in those countries who just want to have their independence from both ISIS, TALIBAN and the US military that invade their country. I mean, no one sanctioned the US for invading Iraq...even if you use 9/11 as a justification, that had nothing to do with the people of that country. If you can justify that, then you can justify Russia taking Crimea in 2014. 

3.  ""But if you detonate suicide bombs because Allah told you to, you might be a terrorist regardless.""

Again, I spoke about brown people defending their land and you immediately went to the most extreme version of that. No is defending suicide bombers on any level because it's so obviously wrong.  The narrative we've spun in the west is that somehow people in the middle-east are lining up in droves to become suicide bombers etc. It's simply not true. The people who've received the brunt of casualties from suicide bombing are the people of middle-east. Assuming they want the same, is like saying every American with a gun is a mass casualty shooter. You see people who look a certain way and you assume the worst about them. Thats the point people are making. Whats happening to Ukraine is terrible and deserves global support on all levels...but its not the first time something like this has happened to people in recent history, the only difference is that its happened to non-white people and people do mental gymnastics to justify not responding then in the same way that we're responding to the conflict in Ukraine.",832014b743a7c57caedd56666c366e6ed690a8c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646298389,,0,{},hz5uxir,False,t3_t5kh3k,False,True,t1_hz5o0j6,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t5kh3k/why_cant_people_not_make_this_situation_about/hz5uxir/,1646298405,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646269589.0,

I feel for the Ukraine people, they deserve all the assistance they need, to fight for their lives and their country. 

I also believe the worst humanitarian crisis in the world happening in Yemen needs just as much attention.

The kids in Yemen, deserve a future just as much as the children of Ukraine. Yet for some reason ,since the problem started in Yemen, nobody seems to be able to do anything for them, even getting them food. And I'm willing to bet  when the page turns for Ukraine towards a better time, the problem's in Yemen will still exist. 

I use Yemen as an example, the people of Taiwan are in the same situation as Ukraine, a superpower wanting to take it for themselves. 

There was is shortage of desperate people in bad situations, that the combined effort of the world couldn't help. 

My hope is that Ukraine can show the world we can work together to solve our problems, to keep each other safe, to elect leaders that will invest in mankind's future and not their wallets

So I'll leave with this, I'm looking forward to the day I can see Ukraine in the UN, NATO, European Union, and on mission's around the world trying to bring peace and stability in places that need it.

Rant over.

Because the refugees in question aren't seen as adding value to the host countries. Poor education, backwards cultures, language barriers, distasteful prejudices, entitlement (yes refugees can be very nasty to their hosts) you name it. Regressive-progressives don't see these concerns as legitimate and will just call you racist. For better or worse, Ukrainians are seen as fellow Europeans and better able to integrate.

&gt;Palestine had technically been invaded but it doesnât stir this kind of ire

Israel isn't a global threat, so people don't feel like they need to unite to defeat it. And Arabs aren't popular with a lot of people who associate them with 9/11, the Taliban, ISIS, or any of the other backwards head-chopping savages in the middle east.

Someone reads about this story and comes her to ask what is happening.

They come here and they find comments saying that this is ok, that there are good reasons that these incidents happened, or that they didn't happen, finding that all posts about these incidents have been downvoted happily. What do you think they think when they see this? What do you think they do? I think they will bring more evidence to try to convince you it is real.

Now imagine if they come here and they find that this sub has already discussed this issue, and we all agree that racism is bad, and that we are sad that these incidents occurred, that even tho the circumstances are very difficult that we are still sad that this happened. What will people fight in that scenario? What message will Putin amplify? That we are not racist? That when something bad happens we feel sorry for the victims? Let him, that would be great.

This story grows in other subs the more we say the things that people are saying. And people come here, and then go back to those other subs to repeat what we say. And same in Twitter, same on the TV. The more we make excuses, the more that this can be amplified outside of this sub.

So what I did was export every single video I have sent since the start of the invasion, which is 147 atm.

A lot of these links may start going inactive in the near future, so I really want to back all of this up, instead of just having the URLs. All the videos have their metadata kept from the discord chat, so they're in mostly chronological order as far as the conflict is concerned, bar me going to sleep and then quickly catching up, or finding a slightly older video later than it was really released. I've included as much footage from the Russian side as I could, but Ukrainian-side footage prevails massively; I have a lot of sources I'm subscribed to since from when the conflict started in 2014. I also have a lot less trust in Russian footage in general, for obvious reasons.

I have chosen to include NSFW footage, as it's really important to me to save what this war really was, not what was shown on TV (wide shots of smoke), so keep that in mind if you wanna get into this.

When this footage is gone from Twitter and Youtube, it'll be much harder to prove some of these atrocities happened. Many ex-Warsaw pact countries have this russophile-russophobe divide, which is now widening and people are starting to entrench on each side. Just because Russia is in a war, it doesn't mean they've stopped exporting corruption to the rest of Europe.

I respond to the second: If you can show me one place where op said that all Ukrainians are racist, or in that video where someone said all Ukrainians are racist, then you have a valid point. But this was not said, and so you you using this as a defense sounds like a denial. You can say the first paragraph without saying the second and you will be happy and the person hearing what you said will be happy, and the problem will go away.

I respond to your third paragraph: one of the complaints is that there was a queue for Indians and Blacks, and a separate queue for whites. The justification is that Ukrainians must leave first, and this is fair, but only 20% of international students are black, and passports were not checked in these queues, meaning there were certainly white people in this Ukrainian queue who were taken out of danger only because they were white. I don't care to debate demographics of efficiency here, I am only pointing out that being advantaged some people and bring brown disadvantaged some people and this is the very definition of racism. It's a complex situation and brown people will forgive this if you share their pain, but if you make excuses then they will think that you want them disadvantaged, that this was not just a careless accident when trying to get Ukrainians out but rather a wider issue.

I respond to your forth paragraph: if Ukraine had prepared better they would not be in this situation. You see how me saying this that makes you feel? They will feel the same when you say what you said. It is a terrible situation, they are there and it doesn't matter the reason, and saying that they are less worthy of protection or safety simply because they are not Ukrainian (or in the case of the black/white queue, not white), is a problem. It contradicts your first paragraph.

I hope you take time to read this and not just respond in defense. All I am asking you to do in future is write the first paragraph that you wrote, and then stop.

Swiss government works quite differently that most.
Our state does not have an opinion. Government is a tool. it is not supposed to have an opinion. Does your car have an opinion o traffic? 

The taking the stance just took time. The government is designed slow, so haste, emotionality and fallacy does not tarnish good governance. Haste makes waste. They had to vote, and that was earliest possible on Monday. Its a wonder it went that quickly... most often it takes weeks of discussions due to diffence in opinions. this time it did not. For Swiss government that was fast. It's hard to understand Swiss politics if your unfamiliar with it. But I encurrage you to inform yourself about it. Might be inspirational. 

Switzerland was one of the first countries bringing diplomatic focus onto Ukraine pleading for action from UN on humanitarian grounds due to fear of a humanitarian crisis. Making major global sanction, cooperation and cohesive Action in time possible. 
Weeks befor most Americans legislators even had a clue where Ukraine is.

Their military budget is 1/10 the US budget. They have only built 14 of their new generation of tank and itâs not even clear if any are battle ready. So Russia could not afford to go electric if they wanted too.

The single biggest issue is that typically in a war zone you donât have an electric grid to plug into. Renewable energy is not at a point it could be deployed for this large of a task. Small scale nuclear should never be deployed to a war zone. Coal, nat gas, diesel generation have same issue as refueling the tanks. I donât see a solution to this issue.

Another problem is energy density, a typical tank has a fuel capacity of about 250 gallons and a range similar to a car so you would need the battery equivalent of about 15-20 Teslas (didnât feel like doing the math so may be off a bit). Finally, you have the issue of durability. Diesel engines are extremely durable, lasting many decades and can be stored without maintenance between conflicts, batteries as you know cannot.

And I want the West to make a statement â or if that is absolutely not possible, otherwise effectively communicate â to the Russian people that if they remove Putin, and his successor orders an end to the war in Ukraine, all will be forgiven, all sanctions removed, Russia readmitted to the international community of culture and business and politics.   
To state clearly that we understand this is not the Russian people doing evil, but one man, and that him disappearing will fix this problem.   
I think this is de facto already the case, but hope an official statement to this effect would accelerate the process and improve the chances.  
I think this is not only the way to end this conflict with the least loss of life - I think it may also be the only way, period.  
No matter how badly the war against Ukraine goes and how long it drags on, Putin cannot afford to lose this â he must know that losing may cost him his power and his life, and therefore I think he won't â even if that means encircling and starving Kyiv while firing low-precision missiles in the city centre until the civilians are all dead and the essential infrastructure and culture are all rubble, even if it means threatening of deploying a tactical nuke against Poland to stop NATO reinforcements. I fear he will escalate as much as he can until he wins, and he can escalate much.   
There is no way Ukraine can defend itself against the overwhelming power of unprecise, severe airstrikes that Russia has in reserve. And as the West, what more can we do without risking open confrontation between nuclear powers, risking all of us? You can't militarily defeat a man this delusional, definitely not without first going through everyone between him and you, and he is putting his whole people in the way to be hurt in his stead.  
 But his people can remove him. His people removing him seems the plausible endgoal of all these sanctions. The earlier they do, the less the damage to Russia, the less the ordinary people get hurt.  
The horrors inflicted upon Ukraine are intolerable. But I also grieve the Russian soldiers forced and tricked into this war. Innocent children are dying each day for this war, while Putin sits safe behind the lines.  
I don't think Putin will ever surrender, no matter how many Russians die and what atrocities are necessary against Ukrainians and how much he has to starve Russia to finance this. I think he is more likely to nuke the planet than give in.  
But I don't think the Russians will tolerate it. There are protests by ordinary people, despite the crackdowns, because this is atrocious, because Putin is shelling civilians in a country they consider their brother. Celebrities, politicians and people across all fields of work are speaking out. The political opposition has condemned this war. Many of the oligarchs are turning on Putin. The Kremlin and the military, while clearly intimidated, must be utterly frustrated. There have been several key mistakes made in this campaign that cost many Russians their lives, and that are hard to explain â and one of the most plausible ways to explain this is that Putin has created a culture of such pressure and fear that it feels impossible to communicate bad news to him or refuse him, and so he keeps ordering more and more mad moves based on intel viewed through rosy glasses, and the generals giving the orders must know that this idiocy is killing their men. This sounds like there are a rising number of people well positioned and motivated to take Putin out, be it by an angry individual assassinating him, a military coup, a legal move by parliament handing him over to be tried for war crimes, a public mov storming his home and lynching him, or whatever other option, and a rising amount of public support would back this. If we put the idea out there and argued for it, spelled out the consequences, is it so implausible that it might happen? And seeing this clusterfuck, wouldn't a replacement for Putin likely not repeat these mistakes?  
What would be the repercussions of outright saying this? Could this be avoided by communicating it differently?  
I hate that Ukrainians and Russians are dying for this man, that Russia and Ukraine are suffering for this man, that we are fighting him so indirectly by fighting Russians who did not choose this. We are fighting the wrong people. The Russian conscripts, crying and hungry and wanting to go home, are not the enemy. The Russian start-ups going broke are not the enemy. The ordinary people losing their pensions are not the enemy. There is no limit to how many troops Putin will throw in the grinder to be incinerated. He will never start caring for them.

&gt;ISTANBUL, Feb 27 (Reuters) - NATO member Turkey changed its rhetoric to call Russia's assault on Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday and pledged to implement parts of an international pact that would potentially limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyiv had appealed to Ankara to block any more Russian ships from entering the Black Sea, from which Moscow launched an incursion on Ukraine's southern coast. At least six Russian warships and a submarine transited Turkey's straits this month.  
&gt;  
&gt;""It is not a couple of air strikes now, the situation in Ukraine is officially a war... We will implement the Montreux Convention,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said in an interview with broadcaster CNN Turk.",da159d5c8212b9908c1506948cfb9795360d35c4,True,False,,,,,0,1646256233,,0,{},hz3nt8u,True,t3_t500nq,False,True,t1_hz1qq9q,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t500nq/turkey_rejects_russias_request_for_navy_ships_to/hz3nt8u/,1646256246,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646227433.0,

Keep in mind Ukraine has just conscripted shit loads of random people, and they're just people in chaos, some of them might be racist and handle these situations extremely badly. This is ok, brown people can separate these people from all the people, but the point that you and everyone else not only misses but actively fights against, is that this should not be happening. No excuses. I don't care if the devil himself possessed this man to do this, it should not have happened. It did happen tho, nothing we can do about it, but it's this insane need from some people here like yourself to deny it that is making it into such a massive deal. Acknowledge it happened and this all goes away.

This guy was at the Ukrainian polish border when this was said. You saying a border 300km away might accelerate things when they're literally meters away from the polish border is why people are so angry about this, it's excuse after excuse after excuse. I know that you didn't know this, but my point stands because it simply shouldn't have happened, no excuses. I will DM you the link because frankly I don't trust people here to not go over to his Twitter and fuck this situation up even more.

Folks just have to make due with the best they have which is western media at the moment. Russian media is nearly entirely discredited because it controlled by the government, and Russian unbiased reporting got left dead in a forest somewhere with their murdered journalists. In some ways the most authentic pieces of information are from various social media accounts of folks in the war zone because it hasn't been filtered, but that's certainly not perfect as we've seen. 

The Ukrainian government is drafting men to fight an invasion. Literally any country would do this if they thought it will help them. It is indeed necessary to fight and not roll over or your country won't exist, and you can have no assurances about how an occupying force will treat the defeated country. The Ukrainians remember well the Soviet caused famine, the Nazi invasion, and the 14,000 dead from the Donbas conflict. They've seen the images of bombed out cities, and heard of the torture, rapes, and killings committed in Chechnya. They are aware of the reputation of Kadyrov and why Putin has unleashed these thugs in Ukraine. Why would any Ukrainian want that, and there is absolutely a point where peace is not worth it. 

Also, defeat is not a forgone conclusion. There is money, weapons, and aid flowing into Ukraine, and in a situation like that it's entirely possible to drag out the war and force Russia to back off. The foreign aid part of the equation is important because it was Chinese aid that allowed North Korea and North Vietnam to fight the United States, it was US aid that allowed Afghanistan to fight Russia, and it was Pakistani aid that allowed the Taliban to fight the US. A safe origin of foreign aid means the fighting only stops when the soldiers stop fighting as opposed to when they run out of ammunition. This kind of conflict can absolutely down a super power. What's working against Ukraine in this arena is it's flat terrain and open fields where the Russian military would operate best.

There is no ego battle on the part of Ukraine here. It is a fight for their independence.

Do you think those who surrender, will actually get the crypto money?

Looking at the videos of Russian soldiers who has surrendered, it doesn't look like situations where anyone would say ""Hi do you want five million crypto dollars?"".

And if any Ukrainian soldier really said this, I suspect the Russian captives would think it was a joke? And if a Russian captive said ""When will I get my five million crypto dollars?"", he'd get punched in the face or laughed at?

But at the same time: For a Russian soldier who avoided entering Ukraine at all, and somehow manage to escape to Poland/the Baltics/somewhere, then, if he got money, so he could live for a while in Europe -- that makes sense? And he could tell others back in Russia that they can avoid the war altogether, by fleeing to Europe, and they'd get money and could live there until the war was over? And after that, they could contact Ukraine, which would say to Russia that they had been prisoners-of-war.

Maybe money to those who never enter Ukraine?
