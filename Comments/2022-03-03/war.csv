200,[],False,,IMNOVIRGIN,,,[],,,,text,t2_se8qxs4,False,False,"A lot of reasons, partly because of the Russian forces, partly because of the Ukrainian forces.

Russia has had a MASSIVE logistical problem since the start of the war, hell I'd argue since before the war started. They were low on food, fuel and overall coordination. 

On day one we saw an important assault for Homestel airport just outside of Kyiv. The VDV (Russian marines) captured the airport and were successful in holding it for most of the day and night. It was obvious that their job was to hold until reinforcements arrived. However, their reinforcements got delayed by Ukrainian forces and the Russian high command obviously didn't think about what would happen if they were delayed. The VDV began losing massively when supplies started running low and eventually the Ukrainian forces were able to recapture the airport.

If supply drops were given to the VDV then maybe they could have held. But no one planned for this and the VDV fell simply because they ran out of supplies.

Logistics. Russian forces are having a nightmare of a time holding down a supply line and protecting them. This is simply because of what Ukraine forces have done, targeting the supply lines with Drones (Showing that the Russian air defence is useless against modern-day aircraft), hit and run tactics and artillery strikes. An army can't run on an empty stomach and Ukrainian forces are making it difficult for Russian forces to feed themselves.

Communication. Russian forces are broadcasting out in the open and anyone with a handheld radio and the known frequency is able to listen in. Ukrainian forces are actually trolling them by playing music and insulting them over the radio. [You can even listen in](https://www.russianwarchatter.info/) from [these frequencies](https://imgur.com/a/UoNMHFE) at the bottom of the page.

Planning. Russian forces are just throwing themselves into the kill zone, literally. I believe they've finally realised that this tactic isn't going to work and are now massing forces outside Kyiv. But initially, Russian forces would arrive at Kyiv and just waltz in with little to no support and just be chewed up by the meat grinder.

Finally, their initial assault to the invasion was a catastrophic failure. They failed to achieve air superioty, failed to cut off communication and failed to destroy supply lines. All they really did was hit some bunkered down soldiers that were prepared for it and hit some airfields.",d571b2507737d4c231ba6d9b4f8ba18622bc98c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646316330,,0,{},hz6m8j8,False,t3_t5jyx2,False,True,t3_t5jyx2,/r/war/comments/t5jyx2/new_guy_here_why_hasnt_russia_succeededin_taking/hz6m8j8/,1646316346,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646287530.0,

But there are some ways that rules of war make sense anyway

1. It makes sense from a game theory perspective. There may be some weapons and actions that would benefit both sides if they weren't used. So it's a kind of gentleman's agreement and if one side breaks it, the punishment will be that the other side will too and both parties will then be worse off than before.

2. It also makes sense after the war. The winner will want to punish the losers. Imagine world war 2. You can't punish everyone involved in the war as it would mean locking up every German, but there are also some people who committed so heinous acts that they need to be punished. You need some way to decide who is punished and who isn't. In theory the winner can do whatever they want to the loser, but they need to justify their actions to themselves and their population. In that case it helps to have a set of predefined rules that can be used as an argument. It also takes away the ""just following orders"" argument. We agreed ahead of time that following orders is not a defense to war crimes.

3. It affects the mind of the common soldier. In practice anything goes in war, but the soldier has to justify his actions to himself, his family and his country's population. In that regard, rules of war may cause some soldiers to think more about the ethics of their actions than they otherwise would.",021245e80e9efaf61cdf9b63e3032ec752202a76,True,True,,,,,0,1646312343,,0,{},hz6ea3s,False,t3_t5id11,False,True,t3_t5id11,/r/war/comments/t5id11/why_are_there_rules_in_war/hz6ea3s/,1646312354,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646283543.0,

Essentially what it boils down to is that Russian Military Doctrine differs from Western (i.e. American) Military Doctrine in almost every respect, however the most crucial difference is through communication and how orders are pushed out. 

Mission Command is an American/Western doctrine where all soldiers in the operation (from the COL down to the PV2) know the operation. That way if COMMO is severed, people know their role, their job, and what is expected of them. Additionally, the American/Western approach to command philosophy is to empower junior officers and NCOs to make decisions that fall in line with the commanders intent. For a good example of this, watch the Brecourt Manor assault in Band of Brothers. The mission was to silence the guns, CPT Winters came up with a tentative plan, NCOs carried out that plan with decision making made at their squad and team levels where needed.

The Russian Army, on the other hand, believes in Command and Control, or C2 (pronounced C-two). C2 consists of Commanders delivering commands to lower echelons. Junior officers and Enlisted soldiers are not empowered to make decisions nor are they brief on the entirety of the operation. Without proper planning, this generally leads to confusion and potentially units not knowing what to do if COMMO is severed. Hence, the stalled 40km column attempting to get into Kyiv. 

Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. With working COMMO, C2 can work exceedingly well and can have armies advance rapidly (i.e. Blitzkrieg). Mission Command can potentially take a long time to plan, prepare, brief, and carry out (i.e. D-Day landings).",487dfc8346a608207cde6f64619da221cd74b76b,True,False,,,,,0,1646306991,,0,{},hz65owb,False,t3_t5jyx2,False,False,t3_t5jyx2,/r/war/comments/t5jyx2/new_guy_here_why_hasnt_russia_succeededin_taking/hz65owb/,1646307003,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646278191.0,

&gt;If he dropped a nuke on a random small military base of NATO as a warning and it kills 100 people, would NATO actually go full on Russia and basically end the world? Or would it take him to blow up Paris or Washington DC for serious destruction?

Putin have much better starting option for nuke escalation: nuke one of the US carriers. That way he demonstrates use of nukes, but he does not hit any country yet.

&gt;What if he nukes Ukraine?

He wants Ukraine as intact as possible, nuking Ukraine would be completely contra-productive to his goals and would create huge dissent at home. Keep in mind that from Russian point of view, he is liberating Ukraine from Western puppets and neo-Nazis. You don't nuke country to liberate it.

The UN has 193 sovereign states including Russia and many more, it's a political body - an agreement and forum where the world represented can discuss the mission for peace around the world.

If NATO gets involved, Russia may use nukes because of the threat level. Going forward you won't hear a peep out of NATO regarding Ukraine, they've messed up big and need to be silent.  


Ukraine applied for NATO membership in 2008, but Russia tried various underhanded ways to block it. Finally in 2014, there was a revolution in Ukraine and Ukraine pursued membership once again. Russia immediately annexed Crimea, started a conflict in Donbass (eastern Ukraine) and made it clear there is no way it would allow NATO on it's borders. NATO ignored all that and kept signaling to Ukraine that it's door is open to join, but time isn't right yet. Ukraine kept pushing to join NATO, so NATO finally went to Russia and told Putin directly that Ukraine will join NATO over his objections. That's more than Putin could accept. The only choices left for Putin is to accept NATO 500km from Moscow or invade Ukraine and make sure it doesn't join NATO.   


NATO seriously miscalculated that Russia would not be willing to pay the heavy economic costs of invasion, and now Ukraine is the one paying the price for NATOs miscalculation. NATO is quietly sitting in the corner, you won't hear a peep out of NATO anymore. NATOs handling of Ukraine was a disgrace, a disaster and a lesson for all not trusting these people.

On a side note, The West has to wreck Russia economically regardless of what happens in Ukraine because China is watching and if Russia doesn't pay a high price, there's a chance China might miscalculate cost of invading Taiwan.

All this mess is caused by NATO leaders disregard for Russia's warnings not to expand eastwards to it's borders. NATO signaled Ukraine that it may join NATO when clearly that's unacceptable to Russia. So basically NATO led Ukraine in to war with Russia.

If this happens Putin will be forced to invade them as well, if he is successful they will meet the same fate as Ukraine, but if he is not he could be backed into a corner where he sees nuclear weapons as the only choice.

I firmly believe OP is correct that energy control is the driving factor. From the US perspective it makes sense. Sit on a surplus while you drain the competition so when their taps run dry you have the control provided by wielding the biggest and most advanced proverbial stick. 

This makes sense in the context of global warming and the fact that if it continues as is, the north sea route will be open during summer by 2050, about the time our competitors start to run dry. Canada and Russia will control the vast majority of those sea shipping lanes *but ships will still need fuel made from oil.* That will make the global trade routes dependent on the US and no one will be able to challenge that authority simply because NATO will already benefit from their partnership with us and the rest won't have the tech to compete militarily thanks to the egregious US defense budget that aims to keep the US at minimum 20 years ahead of the competition.",34eba2ae9bdf74a5d9104518cb04e3257126489d,True,False,,,,,0,1646285025,,0,{},hz5bok8,False,t3_t5gce9,False,True,t1_hz4thp6,/r/war/comments/t5gce9/will_history_remember_this_conflict_as_the/hz5bok8/,1646285043,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646256225.0,

There is no resource, nor tangible strategic benefit for France in Florida. Guiana serves whatever power projection purpose France could hope to gain from a chunk of land in the Americas, all without the litany of consequences that would come with war with the United States. Not to mention the difficulty of occupying a region with a hostile population that doesn't speak French. All things considered France does not have enormous economic exposure to the US according to my barebones research so it seems like, in contrast somewhat to other European nations, France would not be economically impacted to heavily by war with the US. This assuming that this is happening in a sort of diplomatic vacuum at least, where there are no geopolitical ramifications for this sort of thing. Anyway I digress, the largest direct, immediate impact on the French economy would be a drastic downturn in all imports from the United States, which is primarily in the mechanical sector i.e. cars, trucks, planes, engines. So they'd have to find new sources for those but that's not hugely complicated in our previously established diplomatic vacuum. 
Onto the actual conflict, the difference in military resources between these two is so vast it's almost not worth mentioning. The U.S. outnumbers France in every sector from budget to littoral vessels, two things that French generals would be thinking about quite a bit as they gear up to attempt to take Florida. Plot twist: they cannot. Or at least they cant secure it. The continental US is not exactly prepared for a defense, but the US military does keep airmobile units on alert at all times. Air mobility is something both sides are capable of, but without capturing and holding onto I guess at **least** one major airport for enough time for French reinforcements to flood in, and that's assuming surprise, and only accomplishing the goal of getting French boots on the ground. Once the US has begun mobilizing, there will quickly be no more opportunity for air mobility as local American air superiority prohibits any French sorties whatsoever, much less additional air deployments. American 2nd and 4th fleets alone can probably contend enough to put a stop to any further naval operations. Wouldn't at all help to have a French supply line all the way across the Atlantic, I'll be generous and assume that there are massive fuel and ammunition stockpiles in French Guiana to allow for the continued sustainment of French fighting forces, however, even with that planning, there is simply no way to get supplies onto the ground after even a week. That is assuming that they could last that long, with the aforementioned airmobile brigades, the U.S. doctrine likes the idea that they can deploy anywhere within four days, however that's one brigade, and that alone would take close to a third of the U.S. air transport fleet to accomplish.

Most PoW laws require the PoW to be taken care of as good, if not better, than that countries own soldiers. 

* FAIL, he appears to be tortured and forced to say this-  Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor
* FAIL, no video showing he has done this - Able to inform their next of kin and the International Committee of the Red Cross of their capture
* FAIL, Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages
* FAIL, he looks grave and his face is sunken - Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention
* PASS, Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading
* PASS, conflict is still in progress, Released quickly after conflicts end
* FAIL, forcing him to agree w/ them on Putin is for propaganda and he is being compelled to say it, Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number

Obviously I agree with these things. No need to condescend.

But the fact remains. Inexperienced and untrained civilians vs a career soldier/pmc. I'd rather the soldier/pmc risk their life rather than the civilians. 

You also have the consequence of the surge of weapons in the region. At any other time, unrestricted access to military arms would be seen as problematic to the EU. Think about the after effects once the fighting is over. Isn't like all these weapons are going to be turned in to the authorities. No, many will eventually sold to other conflict regions around the world or be used by criminals.

So when I say giving weapons out to people CAN be a liability. That's what I mean. It's a POSSIBILITY that there will be a lot of negative effects of this. But in the short term, of course, Ukraine needs to inflict as much damage to the Russians as possible. And if that means citizens laying down their lives to do that.

By supporting an issue like Ukraine, you can easily some of the benefits most countries are getting to justify the risk of doing something. The rest don't justify the cost.

And you aren't really saying anything about how we can prevent these conflicts from occurring. In your post you said why nobody gave weapons to Georgia, asking for help to conduct war, not prevent or stop it. And the war in Ossetia is not as clear cut.

Some of these conflicts, there isn't really a clear good guy. Every conflict is mostly shades of grey. Who are you to decide who is in the right?

A big factor why Ukraine is getting great PR is because even if there is a Russian speaking minority in Ukraine, its 100% over the top to literally invade all of it. Nobody would have said shit if this contained itself in Donbass and Lugansk. The minority russians could have moved there if they wanted to. Plus Ukraine is democratic vs a big bad 20yr ruling dictator, plus all the geopolitical reasons I mentioned before. It is no longer a civil war.

Did you know the conflict in Yemen has been going over 10 years. Who is in the right at this point? Palestine or Israel? Human suffering doesn't pay for cyber security, missles, that sweet iron dome and stability in the region. Say what you will about Israel, none of the arab states are as stable as them. Plenty of countries technically helped Afganistan and that blew up spectacularly. Ended up not being worth it.

Syria was a failed arab uprising against a dictator - a civil war (nobody is really legally justified in interfering in any civil war). Do you go help the civilians fighting a civil war against a gov backed by Nuclear armed Russia?

Malay is a civil war as well. Georgia and Ossetia is literally  Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over Karabakh. Two people fighting over what they think is theirs. Nobody cared over the internet.

You can just have a peek at the Balkans. Everyone expects a war there soon. Can you sort out who is in the right? Is it the Croats? Bosnians? Bosnian Muslims?

There are pro Russia sympathies in the West, strangely coming from primarily the right which seems bizarre. Nonetheless, this kind of black and white thinking helps no one.

Second, Russians are terrible at the long game in war. This is the most thought out attack they've had in decades, and look how that's going. Though, thw long term gain would solidify their hold on the world grain markets. While China has a chokehold on production.

Third, this is the best thing that could happen for climate change, though not from the Russian point of view. The West is going to pour trillions into developing infrastructure and producing energy and vehicles not powered by fossil fuels. This will be to get around Russia's production of oil. 

They will also be investing in artificially grown food, to get around dependence on Russia's grain. China will be doing the same to support their population. 

Production by Western countries is going to start pouring out of China into the western hemisphere, Africa, and India/Southeast Asia. Being in the western hemisphere will greatly decrease carbon byproducts from shipping. This will also force the US to get rid of engineered obsolescence to decrease imports from China.

The situation in Palestine is nowhere close to WW3. Nobody gains anything if Palestine is any step closer to a state. And the conflict started so long ago, its literally daily boring news.

Malaysia is the same as Syria and Libya. Except it's even further away so we don't have to deal with it. Oh and China backs it.

The current power of social media and the internet is also a big player. Some of these conflicts started quite some time ago. Long draw out conflicts lost attention quickly.
