University of Columbia SIPA produced an arguably [better video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tvU2hwP0xI) by, well, admittedly, mostly professors and faculty that touched on the ugly reality of insurgency and counterinsurgency. In the American experience, insurgents seem to have won all the time and that perhaps skewed the Americans' perception. Stephen Biddle arguably wrote some of the best military science works in, let's say, the 21st century so far, *Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle* and *Nonstate Warfare: The Military Methods of Guerillas, Warlords, and Militias.* He correctly pointed out how the record of insurgency success is quite mixed and Russian counterinsurgency tactics can be very brutal and costly to Ukrainians. Let's say they drive past an apartment block and got an IED in their face. They round up everyone in the block and say: ""you live here, you know who planted the bomb. You either tell us who they are, or we shoot everyone in the block"". I'll also add that with Poland and the rest of the EU basically giving Ukrainian refugees a free pass to leave (something a few Muslims are being very very bitter about), it can easily hollow out the insurgents' base. After all, there was no Republic of Vietnam insurgency against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam after the 1975 take over. Everyone who couldn't stand the Communist have left or they have knuckled under the and find ways to live.

&gt; One must be very careful when using a wargame for predictive purposes. But, on the other hand, no one involved in this wargame has been much surprised by anything unfolding on the ground. Almost all of it took place within the game or was discussed at length among the players. This is in contrast with nearly every expert and pundit on the airwaves, who are expressing astonishment at how this conflict is unfolding. If this wargame had been played at the Pentagon or the White House in the weeks leading up to the war, no strategist or policymaker would be shocked by any event so far seen in the war.

&gt; The heroic resistance of the Ukrainians inspires awe and admiration. Still, their forces are greatly outnumbered, particularly in the air. Moreover, Russia’s capacity to concentrate vast ground fires — artillery, rockets, and missiles — still allows the Russian army to overwhelm the Ukrainians at any chosen point. If history provides any glimpse into the future, the Russian army will eventually uncoil, absorb the war’s early lessons, and renew its advance with grim determination. Russia was preparing to do precisely that when the wargame ended. Still, one hopes that Western pressure, and the infliction of unacceptable losses upon Putin’s legions will create an opening for a negotiated peace.

[],False,,fdfdasdfasdfasdf,,,[],,,,text,t2_bxgdtz5,False,False,"Russia's performance in this conflict has been shockingly poor. Part of that is a poor strategy from the get go of trying to waltz in to Ukraine with as if this was a police action rather than a conventional conflict. Sending airborne troops unsupported suggests they expected a repeat of their largely bloodless annexation of Crimea.

Poor morale is another huge problem. Unlike 2014, the Russian public and military seems much relatively unenthusiastic in their support for an invasion and there was insufficient political tensions to really rile up the population into being significantly in favor of this. If you are the attacking nation, your populace needs to be very riled up and ready to go to war. This isn't like the Azerbaijan Armenia war recently, where the Azeri public was very much in favor of it, meaning morale was high. 

The third issue is that Putin has centralized power in himself to the point where it is undermining the ability of leadership with the Russian government to do what's best instead of what the leader wants. Russia today has more in common with Baathist Iraq under Saddam than the Soviet Union or China which had political parties that served as a counterbalance to the leader even under Mao and Stalin. If Putin dies it's not clear who will even replace him. 

I think the main takeaway from this is that even if you have a force that is powerful, screwed up leadership and choosing bad military strategies to support an even more flawed political strategy can really cause problems.",a9dd0dcbaa6abbcc8149b8d2986f147eb8bf5487,True,False,,,,,0,1646339486,,0,{},hz88u1k,False,t3_t5qvsx,False,True,t1_hz80x7w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t5qvsx/ukraine_megathread_march_3/hz88u1k/,1646339504,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646310686.0

The next Putin is out there somewhere  
\&gt;&gt;

Is he?

Why do you want him?

Do you think that the West will not attempt to push major 'reform' to try and detooth the ability of a single man to release nuclear weapons while controlling all that petrogas wealth?

If Putin wins, Russia is going to suffer the Western political and equestrian classes gleeful return to autarky as 'necessary defense'.

If Putin loses, Russia will be subject to penalties which make Versailles and St. Germain look like a thirty minute time out in your room.  They will cease to be an independent nation and instead be just another tool of the globalist/communists.

The best thing for Russia would be a world class economist who is willing to actually \_do\_ what Putin has long threatened to:  reorient with China and take on as many manufacturing and supply chain sub contractor capabilities as possible so that Russians don't find themselves outside of the global economy and starving.

As they instead shelter under China's 'Couldn't give two shits...' willingness to make them partners in an internal, SCO/AIIB driven, market economy.

That necessity for internal stability means a shift from resources to manufacturing and \*\*creating jobs for Russians\*\* as an opportunity inherent to the cut-off from the offshored equivalents.

Agro = fertilizer, cereals, cattle and the willingness to export No-GMO foods to countries which can't or won't source from the West.

Industrial =  robotics and automan as a front to back, supported, industrial supply source, cheaper (newer) than anyone else.  

Academia =  pumping money into University level education by offering tenuring boards for Western professors who have been blackballed from successful careers or forced to silence in supporting racially and socially biased agendas on Western campuses.

Electronics = home sourced chip design and manufacturing.  Everything else descends from here.  

Infrastructure = roads, power and water projects.  This is a never ending struggle and thus a constant PR project.

Telecomms = free 5G internet for everyone.

Population = tax breaks for Great Russians having kids and massive wealth penalties for those who leave Russia to emigrate.  And incentives for white immigrants who want to bring families into Russia for a safe, sane, social environment.

Financial =  internal, digital, currencies, leveraged using national and state level exchange rates to react to sudden financial shifts deriving from any external sanctions.

Medical = offering to host DWB and other medical bodies, providing 'free delivery' monthly supply quotas to crisis points and guaranteed cost rates, in trade for permanent citizenship and a given internship to begin to apply modern practices to Russian medicine.

Russia should be one of the biggest profit making development projects out there.  Starting with population growth.  And we are turning our backs on them.

They need to beg, buy and steal entire lines of patented processes down to the assembly line workers who run them.

Offer free medical for a ten year contract.  Offer free housing and child education through university level, for a twenty year commitment.

Reverse the brain trust loss and not just for defense purposes but purely as a commercial, profit generating, system.

The West is lost to Caucasians.  Completely.  Particularly in America, our elites have utterly destroyed our ordered society with unwanted colonization by third world populations and the poisoning of our youth with false ideations of guilt and free money as CRT, #Me2 and 'Equity' of socialist-feminist nanny statism over meritocracy.

It's to the point where our median age is 61, none of our women are having kids and we live in a Bowling Alone condition of minimum contribution to our own societies, due to alienation and constant white-blaming.

And this is terribly depressing as a lot of us would like to reown a society.  Putin or his successor could appeal to that in a temperate climate and conservative social environment, amenable to our nature.

If we were half as wise as we pretend to be, we would not allow the global economy to be turned into a sewer of partisanized and regionally power politick isolated, pariah states on whose resource and slave manufacturing largesse we are supplier dependent for the centrist-distributionist model of capitalism to even work.

Nor would we punish entire countries for the actions of their elites and militaries as a consequence to a Medium Regional Conflict between two nation states.  Escalation as a refusal to look at peace deals and negotiated conflict endings while losses were low is how we went from a few tens of thousands killed in 1940 to 60-100 million dead in 1945.  FFS.

Look at the Cold War.  Look at the DECADES wasted in a Super Power race-to-nowhere.  We aren't permanently on the moon.  We aren't really even in orbit.  We continue to deny ourselves reactionless propulsion, genomic intelligence improvement, robotic augmentation of menial labor classes and even simple 'free electricity' fusion power as the fundamental basis of Green Economy.

This is what happens when you build walls around societies for a mere 40 years after discovering a simple reality of physics-go-big-boom.  What we're looking to do could lead to centuries of Hundred Years Why Wars.

Economically, it's as though our senile, morally destitute, leaders are /trying/ to conserve their relevance by destroying the global supply chains from both the market distribution and supply side of the equation.

Why would you want to do that?!  What are they thinking?  Are they honestly attempting to induce a global equivalent to the 'business cycle' which leads to such a massive economic depression so as to force World War Three solution of ""I know how to fix this..."" economic recovery by insanity of nuclear conflict model?

DO THEY UNDERSTAND how many calories per day it takes to sustain a society of 340 million at more than 1,650 basal as avoidance of mass starvation and breakdown of rule of law leading to regional, factional and racial fragmentation of our own nation state?

Loyalty is based on security and prosperity.  Russia is not a threat to us unless we give them an excuse to nuke both our countries.  But messing with macro-economic models \_at a global scale\_, by throwing out banana peel Sanctions, could well lead to tipping point negative synergies which well and truly wreck the U.S.

Please ignore noise on twitter from India. It is highly polarized. Most Indians understand or can be reasoned that there has been no intentional harm done to any Indian( students) by Ukrainians.  
My views are formed with this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8U75dgtMg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA8U75dgtMg) 

  
India is democratic and peace loving. Also, people's opinion have lot on impact on government's decisions. People generally have sympathy for Ukrainian people and want war to end. But the strategic interest of India lie in not offending Russia. As,  


1- Most of our defense equipment is from Russia.  


2- Russia-India has long history of friendship. 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. USA sent a battle carrier group to confront India. U.S.S.R. helped. That war created a successful democratic country, Bangladesh. Last 50 year, US wars across world has only created ruins and failed states.  


In fact, I feel staying away from USA helped us. USA has made a big mess of CENTO ally Pakistan.   


West left Ukraine alone. They had been non-committal in their signaling. Biden recently saying US will not fight if Russia attacks Ukraine. USA, UK not keeping word from Budapest Memorandum.  


3- Ukraine has armed India's no. 1 adversary, Pakistan. Russia mostly do not sell weapons to Pakistan. Again west does.  


4- India makes it own independent decision. It is not in any defense grouping. So, we fight our own wars. The same military build up which Ukraine faced, India has been facing for 2 years from China in Himalayas. China + Pakistan( nuclear states ) are our immediate threat.  
India knows if things escalate Western world and UN can't do much besides lip service.

5- Western weapons(besides France) come with lots of restrictions and supply of their spare parts during crisis is dodgy.  


6- European diplomacy never fall behind India during recent Galwan skirmish with China. Around 20 Indian soldiers lost their life. [https://theprint.in/50-word-edit/putins-principle-is-chinas-idea-india-must-join-effort-to-punish-russias-military-aggression/846299/](https://theprint.in/50-word-edit/putins-principle-is-chinas-idea-india-must-join-effort-to-punish-russias-military-aggression/846299/)   


Also, West do not have any moral high ground to judge India's response. We have seen what happened in Iraqi invasion and Afghanistan. The weapons left by US forces in Afghanistan is our headache now, they falling into hands of radical terrorist organizations. US is not reimbursing us for dealing with side effects of this mess.  


Where Ukraine and west went wrong.  
1- Ukraine should have never given up Nukes. The same Ukraine had opposed India nuclear tests in UN. Thanks to our strategic thinkers.   
Western countries which were guarantors in Budapest Memorandum never showed up.  


Sanctions do not count. They work in long term, immediate impact is needed to save many lives.   


2- Europe is weak. They do not spend much on Military, besides France and UK. Internal commitment to single policy is missing w.r.t. China and Russia. Germany confused with Nordstream 2.0 etc.  
Trump did asked Europe for share defense bill. Some truth is present in his comments.  


3- West and current powers should understand new powers will rise and space to them must be provided otherwise there would be conflict. China, Russia and India are to name a few.   


After 1991, it has been 30 years Europe has not been able to assuage Russian security concerns with NATO expansion into right next door country. Also, they have not been able to secure a treaty with them. Ukraine in NATO would have lead to Cuban missile crisis. Each big country wants to keeps a buffer w.r.t. its territory. China has North Korea. India has Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh.   


4- West should understand with current harsh restrictions on Russia they are throwing Russia into China's arms. Also, how can they imagine a peaceful Europe when country of size and power of Russia is not happy or under severe Economic restrictions.  


Not support Russia's invasion on Ukraine. But Europe and US should address this with Russia with some give and take on negotiation tables.  


5- Last, Ukraine should have know the Russian concern. Should have also know who is the nearest bully(Russia) and would Europe really come to fight for it. Based on this, should have taken a more middle path and should have though in more longer term to achieve its goals without anguishing Russia.  


India is a member if QUAD along with Japan, US and Australia. And we know during war with China these countries won't be able to do much even if wanted. We will fight alone may be against China and Pakistan together.

[],False,,the_bfg4,,,[],,,,text,t2_14rdcz,False,False,"&gt; I figured that this subreddit would be a place for actual discussion about what we're seeing, even if it's tempering expectations, or even bad news.

Sadly, like most other subs, unless mods get draconian like the askhistorians ones, discussion tends to get railroaded by western talking points/pov. 

Feel sad for the conscripts on the russian side, and jesus christ can't even imagine what the ukranians are going through. Only ever heard horror stories about genocide and war from my grand parents, it revolts me every single time i hear their accounts. 

Read from one of the articles on this sub that the main battle-ready/tested VVS units are apparently tied up / deployed in Syria and that the russians don't trust the pilots with CAS or similar missions in case of friendly fire. I doubt the russians can handle a complete guerilla war (atleast the likes of the Middle Eastern ones) without going complete ham on civilians. 

As for the T-90 footage/pics, I've tried to search the footage (reddit search is chef's kiss) and hopefully none of these are duplicate posts. Can't find the first post I remember of a T-90 turret on a highway with a bmp beside followed by the camera panning to a burnt crisp hull beside a tree almost 30 feet away.

Mobile defense. Driving around the countryside in cars, using man-mobile weapons, and hitting the Russians where they are weak. Most units act mostly independent with direction from the command structure. 

When you can move, at max at 30-50kph on an advancing front, the enemy can move at 100kph, you have a movement disadvantage. Even with Russian drones, they won't be able to detect a moving force because cars blend in with the background civilian traffic. And the Ukrainians can flank the Russians using fast movements. Then, with social media, the Ukrainians can determine the locations of the Russians. That gives the Ukrainians a huge information advantage. I wouldn't be surprised if Ukrainian soldiers in the field are using cell phones and radios to receive commands from on high along with on the ground intelligence from telegram and twitter. And if they move in small units (5-30), they'll be VERY effective for hit and run tactics.

These upgrades take depot/plant time, and your limited by both depot/plant capacity, making sure enough of your units are deployable, and good old $$$. So maybe you figure out can upgrade 200 units per year. At this upgrade cadence, you'll never be able to upgrade your whole fleet to a given baseline before a newer baseline appears.

High enough stakes, like the freedom of one's country can bring out this kind of patriotic zeal.

&gt;	I'm often asked about economic sanctions. In short, my scientific conclusion, as a Finance Professor and PhD from Chicago University — the Russian economy is fucked. And what makes it double fucked is that Russian citizens, even the educated ones, for the most part don’t realize what awaits them. Let me count this on my fingers.

&gt;	Very soon, Russians will be faced with shortfalls of basic products. I'm not taking about iPhones, the import of which was already banned, but about food, clothing, cars, white goods, etc. Russia is very heavily integrated into the world economy.

&gt;	Already, major operators are refusing to send containers to Russia. However, even if you managed to find someone who, for a massive amount of money, would be willing to ship containers to Russia, the question becomes how are you going to pay them? Export profts are going to be decimated because buyers will be trying to divest away from Russian products.

&gt;	We can see that even oil companies that arent currently under sanctions are struggling to sell their oil. Gazprom, Russia’s major gas exporter, is already under sanctions, so it's not entirely clear how it, even going to receive foreign currency payments.

&gt;	The Russian central bank has accrued massive reserves, $650 billion USD. Except more than half of this has already been seized, and it’s not entirely clear what it can actually do with the gold. It’s going to be hard to find a bank on earth willing to buy from the Russian central bank so as not to find itself sanctioned or facing massive fines.

&gt;	Many think that Russia, over the last few years has built a huge number of factories. Only thing is, those factories - cars aerospace, household goods etc. rely on imported components. So therefore in coming months what awaits us is the halting of entire production chains with all of their feeder and dependent businesses. We're talking about product shortages, unemployment, the resultant government revenue shortfall with its implied struggle to pay civil service and government employees salaries.

&gt;	Planes, even inside Russia, will also soon stop flying. They're almost all imported, and the West has already banned the supply of spare parts, so we're likely to soon see a mass removal from service of aircraft. 

&gt;	The internet, as we know it, will also be blocked. They’ve already blocked a lot of informational websites, and any day now they plan to block Wikipedia. They have al ready slowed down Twitter, Facebook and they plan to disconnect YouTube.

&gt;	On to agriculture. Are you aware that in Russia, the share of imported seeds is around 40%? In potatoes it's 90%. I mean, of course eventually farmers and agricultural institutes will come up with something, but at least in the short-term we should expect a shortfall in basic commodity production and resultant price hikes. 

&gt;	And even that, not all.

&gt;	Everyone who can leave the country, is going to start leaving. In fact, they're already leaving. The government understands this, and so it's brought in today a range of measures so as to keep IT workers in the country. Except they won't work. Therefore soon, it’s very likely the government will bring in exit visas for certain categories of citizens, or just completely close the country.

&gt;	The only plus side of this entire thing is that those who nostalgically yearn for the USSR will get to experience all of its glories for themselves. And it wont be the comparatively herbivore USSR of the Khrushchev/Brezhnev/Gorbachev era, but a USSR at the head of which stands an insane dictator.

What they are good at is in close range combat and if the enemy movements is limited. Mostly seen in urban combat, but blocked convoys on a forest road are decent as well. What molotovs are good against is everything soft. Infantry, trucks etc. They are also a potential anti-armour weapon, but this should be used in a last resort, when all the better options are exhausted. They are also useful for scaring and disturbing the enemy. 

Namely, soldiers are trained to be able to deal with a few number of dimensions simultaneously. Getting shot at is quite common for a soldier and is expected to deal with it. Now, if the enemy soldier is getting shot at and is also getting shelled by mortars, that makes it more difficult for him to operate. Having to take cover, needing to focus on multiple possible avenues of enemy attack. Now add a molotov cocktail that lights his vehicle on fire.

I don't think Putin is stupid enough to keep pushing Plan A (puppet regime). He's probably got a Plan B that looks something like this:

Ukraine is not homogeneous. Some parts are more pro-Russian than others. Consider a situation where east-of-Dnieper River is annexed into Russia or turn into a puppet state, and west (except Crimea and areas around it) remain Ukraine. As for cities along the banks of the Dnieper, I don't know. A split city could be pretty awkward.

The population would then ""vote with their feet"" so that dissidents have an option other than insurgency: moving.  Most people have read or understand the Art of War concept of not backing an enemy into a corner but always giving them an escape route to more easily rout them. Rest assured Putin knows this too.

Partitions like this have happened many times in history. Even recent history! Look at, e.g., Iraqi Kurdistan, the Sunni Triangle, Crimea/Donbas, Georgia, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Artsakh, etc.

It doesn't always have to be violent. See, e.g., the cleaving of Czechoslovakia (a Slavic state like Ukraine), into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

&gt; I remember a lecture I saw about guerrilla warfare (specifically in the context of WW2 Italy) where the lecturer gave a rule of thumb I like to remember about being a guerrilla/insurgent/resistant
&gt; 
&gt; He said, the first thing that happens when you become an insurgent is everyone you know dies horribly. All your friends and your family get tortured to death. Then that continues every day until either it’s you being tortured to death or the war ends
&gt; 
&gt; That people still resist is a sign of how intolerable the conditions are, rather than their will, because no one has enough will to do that if they still feel like they have a choice. Therefore it isn’t something that can be taught or ordered

Ukrainians feel like they still have a choice. If Russia decides to just occupy the country without deciding to fuck everyone's shit up, then for the most part, people's daily lives won't change enough for them to risk their lives. And it's been pointed out that Russia and Ukraine share a lot of culture and connections - so why would Russia as an occupier start doing the kinds of things that drive a civilian resistance?

Another is that the Republican party increasingly viewed conservative control of the South as a non-problem and turned its attention to other concerns.

This doesn't sound very much like ""the North couldn't handle the insurgency and had to leave."" This discusses political violence against civilians, not action against the Union army.

The Ukrainians can do a strategic retreat, in that they don't retreat. They just let their forces die as they move back. Until the supply lines are overextended and they can start whittling down the Russian forces. Attacking supply lines behind enemy lines. 

Or they can mass a counter offensive with their new troops. 

Or they can throw everything into stopping the Russians from encircling cities.

Mostly because the Ukrainians have better intel and support. Just not as many tanks/arty.

If that's what's going on, the Ukrainian forces are sending limited resources to the eastern cities. And they'll let the eastern cities fall in order to regroup, and reorganize the bulk of their remaining forces. Then, they want to hit the Russians hard all at once. Probably 100k soldiers in weak flanks. Especially if their supply lines are overextended. Try to surround them as many of the Russian soldiers will just surrender if surrounded. 

It would feel horrible if you were one of the soldiers/population stuck in Mariupol or Kharkiv right now. Your job is basically to grind the enemy until you die. Maybe hold off until the counter attack is ready.

They might need to resort to rationing and boiling it, but that’s not the end of the world. That said, I think you’re right that they can still be effectively cut off from outside supplies, which turns it into a waiting game. 

Working against Ukraine is their supply of food, ammunition, medical supplies, and possibly water, which would be a big game changer if actually gets shut off. 

Working against Russia is obviously the internal and external pressure to end the war, e.g. protests, sanctions, their collapsing stock market, etc. They’re also apparently struggling to source replacement parts and machines (as in their factories literally cannot make them, and they obviously can’t afford a lot right now), so if Ukraine can find some way to pick them off, whether it’s air support, drones (foreign or their own), javelins, or something else, Putin might be forced to make a move or just watch his army’s resources bleed dry, even if faltering internal support and external financial pressure doesn’t run out his clock. The only other consideration I can think of is that Putin seems to be pinning at least some hopes on killing Zelensky. This might  also cause him to try and take the city by force earlier than he otherwise would. Finally, he doesn’t seem to have a problem with ignoring his advisors or generals, and might just insist on it out of impatience and a callous disregard for the cost to Russia service members. 

If Russia does try to take Kyiv by force, I think it’s going to be a meat grinder for both sides, but especially the Russian forces.

The supply line complexities from Russia to Kyiv are even problematic than from Belarus, so presumably Putin want's to avoid them.

&gt;MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine and another 1,597 had been wounded since the beginning of Moscow's military operation there, Russia's RIA news agency reported.

&gt;It was the first time that Moscow had put a figure on its casualties.

&gt;The ministry also said that more than 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers and ""nationalists"" had been killed and about 3,700 wounded, according to Interfax. The numbers could not be independently verified and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.

Commentary:

I mostly posted this to compare against the invasion of Iraq in 2003. That invasion, which took 41 days to complete, lead to Coalition losses of 196 dead and 551 injured, against Iraqi military deaths of anywhere from 7,600 to 45,000. Even the most conservative K/D ratio for the US (~39) is still quite larger than that of the Russians (~5) thus far (day 7). All this assumes that the Russian figures are correct, of course.

Use molotovs to start a line of fire across the street/alley so the troops won't cross (well, at least it'll slow them down). The resulting smoke can also be used to irritate enemy troops or make them don their chemical gear, which is cumbersome and time-consuming.

Being targeted with infrared sensors? Use molotovs to set a bunch of random fires everywhere, and also some in places you can use to hide from the enemy. The flames can make it much harder for the sensors to detect you. They also make it hella annoying to use night vision goggles.

That means that Putin has an artificially weakened negotiating position because he's unreliable at maintaining any agreement he makes. That's not ""the best that can be hoped for"".
