Yuzivska gas field has US$67 trillion dollars worth of natural gas (called ""tight gas"") it is not easily recoverable but it can be fracked and that technology is well-developed now. It is the second or third largest natural gas field in Europe and has not been heavily developed as shortly after its desicovery in 2010 Russia invaded the Donbas region of Ukraine and the nearby conflict prevented much interest in developing the field.  
It just really struck me at how its eastern border so closely matched the current conflict front lines.  
Also it made me wonder, how much that natural gas would have influenced Russia's decision to invade. Even if Russia doesn't develop the field, preventing it from being developed would ensure continued European dependence on Russian energy sales until Europe can further transition to non-fossil fuel based energy.

If so, then https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_13th_HRMMU_Report_3March2016.pdf has:

&gt; 25. [...] In Shyrokyne, a key location in the ‘grey zone’
between the Government-controlled city of Mariupol and the town of Novoazovsk controlled by the armed groups, OHCHR documented extensive use of civilian buildings and locations by the Ukrainian military and the Azov regiment, and looting of civilian property, leading to displacement.

&gt; 103. On 23 December, OHCHR met with four detainees held in Mariupol SIZO for their alleged involvement in the 9 May events. They complained that they had been ill-treated by SBU officials and members of the Azov regiment in Mariupol, detained incommunicado for some time in September 2014, and that evidence extracted through torture was being used in their trial. They added that they had been denied medical assistance for the injuries sustained through torture, and had ineffective legal representation. Of grave concern is the allegation that the accused suffered reprisals in the form of threats, intimidation and ill-treatment by the SBU after they challenged the admissibility of evidence in court.

&gt; 161. Another major concern is the ongoing presence of military forces in civilian areas and indiscriminate shelling continue to be the main factors endangering civilians, and affects their ability to access housing, land and property. During the reporting period, OHCHR collected detailed information about the conduct of hostilities by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne (31km east of Mariupol), from the summer of 2014 to date. Mass looting of civilian homes was documented, as well as targeting of civilian areas between September 2014 and February 2015. 

and https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_14th_HRMMU_Report.pdf has:

&gt; 49. [...] A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by eight to 10 members of the ‘Azov’ and ‘Donbas’ battalions in August-September 2014.

&gt; 59. A resident of Mariupol was detained by three servicemen of the ‘Azov’
battalion on 28 January 2015 for supporting the ‘Donetsk people’s republic’. He was taken to the basement of Athletic School No. 61 in Mariupol, where he was held until 6 February 2015. He was continuously interrogated and tortured. He complained about being handcuffed to a metal rod and left hanging on it, he was reportedly tortured with electricity, gas mask and subjected to waterboarding and he was also beaten in his genitals. As a result he confessed about sharing information with the armed groups about the locations of the Government checkpoints. Only on 7 February, he was taken to the Mariupol SBU, where he was officially detained.

Both of those reports are from 2016; I haven't made an effort to see whether there are more recent ones. And I'm not trying to make a statement one way or the other about whether Azov is, or has been, *unusually* criminal, for a military unit of its size, engaged in the amount and the sort of fighting that it has been engaged in since 2014. Just pointing out the obvious that yes, there are *some* war crimes that have been committed by members of the Azov Battalion, in the course of their service in that organization.",43bfc6cd98abcb25825d05c48889dcb8c5e07d1e,True,False,,,,,0,1649304754,,0,{},i3q0c06,False,t3_txmev6,False,True,t1_i3o8375,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/txmev6/simple_explanation/i3q0c06/,1649304767,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649275954.0,
