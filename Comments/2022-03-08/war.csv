Meaning the Russia have **learn nothing** of how Hitler propaganda have work and how was used to delude the mind of the people. It is sad. Nobody can do anything to those who are brainwashed, but they have done it to themselves really. The same people fail to establish democracy. The cause of what is happening now is to a extend of the cultural mindset of Russia.  

But Russia for the last 30 years have this open window of the world - we are not talking about N. Korea here. Yet, what Russia saw looking in that window?  Was either deliberately twisted from people as Putin or willingly accepted as something inappropriate and unwanted. Its the Russian mindset which full itself with anger. Its the Russian mindset who saw itself as both - the morally right, and in the victimhood.

&gt;The rapid rise in Russian intolerance towards foreigners and democracy, along with a renewed emphasis on national  exceptionalism, should not come as a surprise.  We are dealing with a delayed reaction to the collapse of empire.  This collapse shocked Russia in the early 1990s, but the ensuing period of continuous improvement in living standards delayed and softened the reaction to the the imperial downfall.  As is so often the case, increased consumer confidence acted as a kind of anaesthetic.  In the current economic downturn, **the appeal of quasi-fascist discourse was predictable.**

The Russia collective mindset was predictable, even for outsider. We have all feel in the air this was in the baking.

Every drone, partisan, saboteur and soldier available. All out attack just before dawn. Doesn't have to last long or attain objectives (but take them if it comes your way). Here's the reasons why.

1) The Russians are not likely dug in. They have objectives to make that they aren't making. This is likely what the commanders are most worried about. Pissing off Putin.

2) There is only so much artillery. It can't be effective everywhere at once. Likely it's all sighted on civilian structures so there would need to be time to realign and there would be overwhelming calls for support and an army like that is very political likely causing them to switch targets to the guy with the biggest bark. Plus some may be under attack and have to relocate. 

3) Moral. Gives the home side a bit of a boost but it will hammer the Russian moral. Seeing shots coming at them from everywhere, will make their already impossible task seem suicidal. 

4) The partisans need to get involved and get their first real battle. They don't have to be courageous but they at least need to do a hit and run or cause some other form of mayhem. They will get better as the war goes on, but they got to get their feet wet first.

Basically there are reports that Russia is not recognizing and claiming the dead russian troops (200s) for this 2022 invasion. Assuming Ukraine will win this war, the Zelensky's government can create a war memorial maybe in Central Ukraine to remember this dark history of the country. Obviously it will be similar to Poland's Auschwitz Camp (UNESCO Heritage Site) where visitors can learn the history, debunking the denazification of russian propaganda, the sacrifice of the Ukrainian people and to remember the attrocities commited by the Russian forces.

The most important part of the war memorial would be the mass burial ground of the dead Russian troops while their belongings will be displayed in the museum's glass cabinets. With this, the family members, relatives and friends of the missing Russian soldiers would have to travel all the way to Ukraine to visit the graveyard of their loved ones. The Russian people will be able to see with their own eyes the true Ukrainian society, the crimes commited by their government and more importantly, to slowly chipped away the countless years of Kremlin's brainwashing to its people.

Besides being a war memorial center, the region might also become an international dark tourist spot bringing some income to the local community. If you look at all the man-made popular tourist spot in the world, usually there is something artificially huge to attract people to visit such as the Statue of Liberty or Eiffel Tower. I don't know what kind of physical monument to set-up but it could be a super large statue of a tractor/bayraktar/NLAW/stinger/or a Ukrainian sunflower.

Also agree that this kind of ""kill everything"" warfare has to stop.  That said, there are some differences between Iraq &amp; Ukraine that are worth our awareness.  

The Bush administration actually believed Iraq had WMD.  There were systemic problems in the intelligence community that contributed to this belief, most notably the desire to support a perceived desired answer, but Bush didn't do the things that we see Putin doing.  Heck, even  his only military knows that the reason for this war is bogus.  

I don't know where your numbers of Iraq ""schools"" destroyed comes from, but even if it's close to being true, remember that the US spent exorbitant amounts on precision guided munitions specifically to reduce the number of civilian casualties.  We know it's bad to kill civilians.  We learned that the hard way in Vietnam. If you talk to anyone who was actually engaged in the war in Iraq, they went to extraordinary lengths to avoid spilling innocent blood, often to the point of putting their own lives at risk.  Most soldiers I know truly felt pity for the civilians there and cared for them.  I don't know if Russians are intentionally targeting civilians, but I know the US military worked very hard to avoid them.

I know you're ""just sayin'"" to get people to think, and that's good.  As a veteran, I continue to think about this stuff a lot.  In spite of the big differences between these two conflicts, your point about war being cruel, ugly, and unfair is obviously true.

If US/Canada enter Russia from the east, it's for the pure purpose of grabbing land. **Grabbing land**, bro....consult someone more intelligent to explain if this is too challenging.

No country (let alone Russia) will like someone invading their space. It doesn't matter how fucking cold Eastern Russia is,  you absolute tool. If we can live in Alaska, WHY THE FUCK CAN'T WE LIVE IN SIBERIA? Again, consult someone smarter if this is going over your head.

Strategically, NATO AUTOMATICALLY DISTRACTS PUTIN if we come in from the East. Putin is now forced to not only divide his attention, but he has to gather his forces to march 4000 miles the other way!  This will make it easier for NATO allies to fight them from the west.

Now regarding China, who they fuck told you they were our enemies? Stop reading fortune cookies...it's lowering your IQ, which is quite low already based on the fact that you can't understand simple strategy.

And that's all this is, bro....a strategy. You are just another Reddit tool who spends his life looking for people to argue with. I say the sky is blue, and instead of agreeing, you will write a book why it's not blue. There are millions of morons like this, you are no different. We have real hate materializing in that part of the world, dude....war is happening...people are dying. How did we get to this point?

Bad thoughts lead to bad actions. You're pissing me off with your unwillingness to listen. You don't have to agree, but you also don't have to be a complete belligerent jerk. And I know I have pissed you off, so guess what? The cycle of dislike will continue between us. But you know what, bro? You started it. So instead of like NATO who wants to just sit by and watch its ass getting kicked, I'm kicking your ass right back. That's what strong people do....they fight back.

Is it true that they weren't told about the war beforehand? Yes, but they are now willingly following criminal orders from their commanders, they know what they are doing, they know that they are invading a foreign country. 


It's not Putin ranging the guns, pressing the triggers, shelling and bombing cities, opening fire on civilian cars. You see a few tens of thousands of Russians go out in the street and say ""Oh Russians hate Putin they're victims too"" but just like the Germans (contrary to what they're saying now) didn't hate Hitler, Russians don't hate Putin. Some do, but the reality is that the overwealming majority of people either openly support him, blindly support their country out of nationalist reasons, or are quiet and compliant. 


It baffles me how the world is once again eating the ""We're just following orders"" bullshit after shouting ""Never again"" for 80 years. 


The war would be over in 30 seconds if the Russian army opposed it. If the Russian people (not just some pacifist students) went out in the streets to riot. 



It's not one man waging this war, it's stupid to claim so. It's Russia's war. Russia is the invader, the agressor.

The US has bases all around the world, but that is not the same thing at all to being a military nextdoor neighbor. Those bases are designed for support for the countries they are in and to provide intelligence and rapid response for conflicts. That is very, very different from staging an invasion of a foreign country. The Iraq and Afghan wars took MASSIVE resource movements and positioning of forces. It was a huge deal, and the US still pulled off not only the invasion but a long-term occupation of both. But it took a lot and we arguably still lost both. But if those conflicts were on the US border...it wouldn't have even been a fight. 

I'm very aware of the differences between the conflicts, but comparing the US taking Baghdad on the other side of the world, and Russia getting their asses kicked on their doorstep is not a fair comparison. It really shows how weak Russia's military truly is.

So far, Russia is definitely getting their ass handed to them in a number of ways. Failures in logistics, failures in achieving Day One objectives, failures in achieving air supremacy (Ukranian jets and drones are still flying sorties and doing CAS runs.) Low Russian morale/lack of fighting spirit, inexperience of the Russian troops at the front, poor vehicle maintenance and care (Most of their armor comes from mothballed, in storage vehicles which, from examining in content seen has NOT been maintained) sloppy Tactical maneuvers, the list goes on and on. As the casualties start mounting and as the Russian economy starts to crumble, maintaining the Armed Forces of Russia will be more and more difficult. Lack of imports, etc. Putin may try to speed up the process and consider using a Tactical Nuclear Strike on a city like Kyiv (Which STILL hasn't been taken) to break Ukranian resistance and to force them to surrender. Thus allowing him to roll across Ukranine unopposed and unmatched.


I hope I'm wrong though. Your country is showing the rest of the free world what it truly means to fight against oppression. I wish we could join you.
