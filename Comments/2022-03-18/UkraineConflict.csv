So for now, Mykolaiv is no longer in immediate danger of falling, and is not even being shelled.

I understand the distrust of Chinese people, and there are many good reasons for it. China has a far, far greater control over its citizens than Russia has. To begin with they have the social credit system, which rewards/punishes citizens for behavior according to what CCP deems appropriate. Second, the propaganda and brainwashing of their citizenry is far more sophisticated than that of Russia. Thirdly, China is quite well known for sending agents for espionage and to corrupt foreign institutions to suit their goals.

However, I've also come to learn that many Chinese have come to my country precisely to escape this system. Not all are brainwashed and many leave China because they can't stand a system that assigns them scores based on how ""patriotic"" they are and which determines whether or not they can apply for a bank account or even take the train in the morning. 

I don't think China will go so far as to send one Chinese person to serve in the Foreign Legions. It's simply not worth it for the little intelligence they can gain. This might be just one Chinese person who, while difficult to accept, may genuinely want to be free and to serve the cause of freedom.

Make a good point besides ""just believe me"". Your age is a double edged sword. Either you are experienced or a fuck up who wasted his years. That's based on who you actually.

Second: Look man, I'm old enough to remember the cold war. This shit isn't a joke. This isn't a video game. This isn't an action movie where the good guy always swoops in and wins.

There's very good reason why even presidents like Eisenhower didn't just steamroll into Hungary after they tried to leave Soviet control in '56. Or Czechoslovakia in '68. Or Poland in the 80s. Were all of those presidents ""appeasing"" Russia? Were they living their ""lives worthless"" because they didn't want to envelope the world in a nuclear holocaust?

Or maybe, just maybe, we already had a lot of smart people analyze this stuff and found that there isn't a way to win in a war like that, no matter how morally righteous we are. Once it's started there's no way to stop it until everyone is dead.

Like it or not, Russia has nukes (and other very dangerous weapons that aren't talked about as much). Ignoring that reality is a dangerous and reckless. Putin is more than capable of using them, and if he's backed into a corner there is every incentive to use them in some way. This isn't just my opinion: most analysts and military experts have been saying this now for weeks. Even a completely rational dictator could have good reasons to use them in the right circumstances. Just because you wish that weren't so does not make it true.

So no, I don't think it's a good idea to get NATO involved.

&gt;There's a few interesting tidbits in the latest daily assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank.

&gt;It says the southern port city of Mariupol is likely to fall in coming weeks amid a sustained Russian assault.

&gt;ISW analysis finds that Russian forces made no major territorial progress on Thursday, concurring with US and UK intelligence assessments.

&gt;But ISW concludes the ""total destruction"" of Mariupol and increased targeting of its residential areas may lead to its capitulation or eventual capture.

&gt;***The think tank also says Ukrainian forces on Thursday appear to have inflicted heavy damage on Russian forces around Kyiv, and repelled Russian operations in the Kharkiv region.***

&gt;It notes, too, that Ukraine's air defence continues to be effective, having shot down 10 Russian aircraft on Wednesday alone.

&gt;According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia may have expended nearly its entire store of precision cruise missiles in the first 20 days of its invasion.

&gt;Meanwhile, low morale is being reported among Syrian recruits, including several cases of self-mutilation to avoid fighting.

&gt;Many mercenaries see deployment to the region as a chance to desert and migrate to the EU, according to Ukrainian intelligence.",4e527b6dd7500fd6b2c8c61d024d8167f5ebfc60,True,False,,,,,0,1647577047,,0,{},i144bvt,False,t3_tgomh6,False,True,t1_i13fokh,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tgomh6/ukraine_retakes_75_miles_of_russianheld_territory/i144bvt/,1647577060,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647548247.0,

3) Nato DOESNT EXPAND. Member countries apply for entry of their own free will. NATO is a security TREATY. Its not like the EU or the USSR. Its not a blending of nations into a larger nation. 

&gt;Yes the ussr is not Russia. Read a book on the Soviet Union, and it‚Äôs downfall. They are different states from the ground up.

If they're so different why is its leader implementing a nearly exact state apparatus and style of government of the former USSR? 

Telling me to ""read a book"" after you literally said to me the USSR was similar to another occupying nation overtaking another country like Israel is to Palestine is fucking IMBECILIC TO THE NTH DEGREE.

&gt;The IDF is too busy helping commit a genocide to attack other nations. 

Genocide? How? Explain to me how Israel has attempted to kill all palestinians. Last I checked thats what Palestine is doing actually, and if it weren't for the Iron Dome they would have done so 10 times over by now. 

Tell me how warning people of attacks so they can move before they strike Hamas is genocide. Last I checked that's kind of the opposite and if they wanted to genocide they would never warn anyone or anything?

&gt;I don‚Äôt give a fuck what was going on in Afghanistan. 

Yet you argued with me about it to the point of making insane, clearly ignorant statements. Its very obvious you care, and that is is. You only have emotions. No facts.

It seems pretty clear that Putin does not want Ukraine in the Western bulwark. He's repeatedly said that. It doesn't seem very controversial to me. And he certainly does not want lethal weapons in Ukraine which could reduce Russia's legitimacy in terms of safety.

I think you are taking it to mean ""these ethnic non-Russians must be exterminated"", but I don't see any reason to believe that. Putin is not exterminating any other races in Russia (although there's a wide variety to choose from). What he is threatened by is the West and it's economic / political / and especially security model which Putin thinks harms the Russian model of development.

BUT, we have to be realistic. The reason this happened was because Russia viewed Ukrainian NATO membership as an existentially threatening issue.  After Ukraine applied in 2008 and the US forced other NATO members to say Ukraine would be admitted, this caused a series of events, including an enormous protest, an alleged coup, Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the whole Donbas conflict. These things are not unrelated, and there's plenty of smart people who understand this is the driving factor that caused the conflict. 

So we can do one of two things.

We can either stand on principle, fold our arms across our chest, and say ""come hell or high-water, I am doing this,"" which will have no meaningful change in NATO's own policy to now refuse Ukrainian admission (which has been true since 2014), and it will tell Vladimir Putin that Ukraine will remain defiant and he will be compelled to wreck the country.

Or, we can be realistic, and understand that NATO admission is literally impossible at this point, and we can say Ukraine should be a neutral state like Finland or Austria. Or in other words, exactly how independent Ukraine was before 2014 (minus some territories). 

By the way, if you haven't researched it, you should understand the FULL events of Euromaidan, and how that led to an ethnic-based civil conflict which led us to the present conflict. This helps explains Putin's rhetoric to some degree. And it shows you, most importantly that ...

Putin is not Adolph Hitler. 

He's not. I'm sorry, but he's really not. The comparisons fail for many reasons, but two of the biggest ones off the top of my head are: Hitler had an army of 16 million and the most advanced economy in the world, and Putin has less than one million men and a failing economy. Furthermore Russia grows weaker by the year as their fatal demographic plunge remains terminal and shows no signs of abating. In other words Russia is fucked now or later. Putin's rhetoric is also quite different than Hitler's, and it seems his motivations in Ukraine are largely driven by NATO, EU, and Donbas issues -- NOT exterminating an ethnic group. You mentioned his use of the word ""purify"" but he does not mean that in an ethnic sense, he's talking to Russians who are resisting Putin's authoritarian rule and he's saying he wants to ""purify"" Russia by getting rid of Western ideals.

Saying Putin is Hitler is an extremely dangerous thing to do, because I believe it's the US media trying to drive everyone into a rage and convincing everyone that a compromise is not possible -- but in fact there is every reason to believe it is possible.",fc4b92b82a4923001f56539694cc94907cf4e49b,True,False,,,,,0,1647552087,,0,{},i12laig,False,t3_tfocc0,False,True,t1_i12da06,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tfocc0/why_we_hate_politicians_all_talk_no_action/i12laig/,1647552102,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647523287.0,

It all stems from the 2008 decision to admit Ukraine to NATO, and following that the 2014 Maidan protest, which was a coup in Putin's eyes and arguably a coup in reality. That's when he annexed Crimea to save Russian control Sevastopol Naval base, the following war in Donbas, etc. It all comes from the same thing. So I really think that means there's room to negotiate a reasonable end to this conflict. I think it could have been negotiated even earlier BEFORE the conflict, but spilled milk and all that.

The problem is, as far as I can tell, one major component to a peace deal would be the US blessing on it. And unfortunately, it's so political toxic to suggest anyone make a deal with Putin that domestic politics makes it seem impossible. That's incredibly frustrating to me personally because I've been screaming and tearing. my hair out about how we need to stop treating Putin like Hitler and make a fucking deal with this jackass. Like him or not, we have to live on the same planet. We have to coexist. And I want Ukraine to exist in that reality as well.

Regarding Hitler with nuclear weapons -- well, that has crossed my mind more than a few times during this crisis. What if a totalitarian leader decides to hold the world hostage with nukes?I don't know any way to stop that other than getting serious about nuclear non-proliferation (a piece that we abandoned under Trump when we dropped out of the Intermediate Range nuclear missile treaty, over Putin's objections). I think we need to make a push for non-proliferation during peacetime, obviously it's impossible in times of crisis.
