You have had experience in this haven’t you?
And yes to enforce a full no fly zone in the typical sense it is to prevent by any means including cross boarder fires. What’s your point?
And no it is not automatic that aircraft are shot down.
You do realise a long standing no fly zone against the USSR has been made before right?
And yes Russians do differentiate between nuclear and conventional otherwise it wouldn’t be used as a threat would it.
You do realise that the Russians understand the impacts and most like understand better than you of firing nuclear weapons?
The only need to fly hundreds of miles into Russia to destroy SAM sites as generically put by you would be if they were used and it doesn’t require flying hundreds of mile but for the sake of your argument and what is the problem with that?
So how many thousands and potentially millions die in said logistical/economic black hole till the risk is excepted? Are we sure that the intelligence gathering that Russia is prepared to continue with further invasions just something to worry about later???
Should we wait till people we like are invaded?
So as you so eloquently put the risk of total destruction and occupation of Ukraine is not a catalyst for risk why do you think the defence of is a catalyst for Russia to launch mass nuclear weapons?
Have you considered all possible reasons why the west didn’t involve themselves prior to invasion?? Or even if they would like to now in a direct role why they may not?? You believe it’s only the fear of nuclear war stopping them nothing else at all?

It seems pretty clear that Putin does not want Ukraine in the Western bulwark. He's repeatedly said that. It doesn't seem very controversial to me. And he certainly does not want lethal weapons in Ukraine which could reduce Russia's legitimacy in terms of safety.

I think you are taking it to mean ""these ethnic non-Russians must be exterminated"", but I don't see any reason to believe that. Putin is not exterminating any other races in Russia (although there's a wide variety to choose from). What he is threatened by is the West and it's economic / political / and especially security model which Putin thinks harms the Russian model of development.

Doubling down I see. No. Its not. I thought the USSR was gone? You can't even keep your garbage organized and consistent. 

1) International nuke capabilities including sub capabilities i mean there is literally NO NEED for any nukes to go that close anywhere. The threat is already ""at the doorstep"" now.

2) NATO is not in any kind of cold war with Russia and never was. This is all part of your fucking lie that NATO ""agressed"" on anyone. Cue the old old old lies (like 8 years old now) that Maidan was a CIA coup right?

If they're so different why is its leader implementing a nearly exact state apparatus and style of government of the former USSR?

Genocide? How? Explain to me how Israel has attempted to kill all palestinians. Last I checked thats what Palestine is doing actually, and if it weren't for the Iron Dome they would have done so 10 times over by now. 

Tell me how warning people of attacks so they can move before they strike Hamas is genocide. Last I checked that's kind of the opposite and if they wanted to genocide they would never warn anyone or anything?

&gt;There's a few interesting tidbits in the latest daily assessment from the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank.

&gt;It says the southern port city of Mariupol is likely to fall in coming weeks amid a sustained Russian assault.

&gt;ISW analysis finds that Russian forces made no major territorial progress on Thursday, concurring with US and UK intelligence assessments.

&gt;But ISW concludes the ""total destruction"" of Mariupol and increased targeting of its residential areas may lead to its capitulation or eventual capture.

&gt;***The think tank also says Ukrainian forces on Thursday appear to have inflicted heavy damage on Russian forces around Kyiv, and repelled Russian operations in the Kharkiv region.***

&gt;It notes, too, that Ukraine's air defence continues to be effective, having shot down 10 Russian aircraft on Wednesday alone.

&gt;According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia may have expended nearly its entire store of precision cruise missiles in the first 20 days of its invasion.

&gt;Meanwhile, low morale is being reported among Syrian recruits, including several cases of self-mutilation to avoid fighting.

&gt;Many mercenaries see deployment to the region as a chance to desert and migrate to the EU, according to Ukrainian intelligence.",4e527b6dd7500fd6b2c8c61d024d8167f5ebfc60,True,False,,,,,0,1647577047,,0,{},i144bvt,False,t3_tgomh6,False,True,t1_i13fokh,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tgomh6/ukraine_retakes_75_miles_of_russianheld_territory/i144bvt/,1647577060,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647548247.0,,,,

Ultranationalist Azov members have been spotted there… Some of them are truly evil people

Remember now, Ukrainian Soldiers/Military has been reported for War Crimes… oh wait I bet you all haven’t read about that..

“Based on the information collected by the Foundation, a clear conclusion can be drawn that most of the torture victims are notmembers of the Donetsk or Lugansk People’s Republics’ self-defense forces, but civilians. A ‘reason’ for arrest and torture of civilians by the Ukrainian side can be as simple as involvement in anti-Euromaidan rallies, participation in Russian TV shows, expression of your opinion on the Internet, involvement in pro-DPR rallies, participation in the referendum, ‘possession of a telephone number of a Russian iournalist’, ‘Caucasian names - Aslan, Uzbek’ in the personal phone contacts, a phone conversation with people from ‘the Donetsk People’s Republic’, ‘receiving medical assistance in the DPR’, etc. The same absurdity and lack of substantial evidence is characteristic of the other accusations.

Second: Look man, I'm old enough to remember the cold war. This shit isn't a joke. This isn't a video game. This isn't an action movie where the good guy always swoops in and wins.

There's very good reason why even presidents like Eisenhower didn't just steamroll into Hungary after they tried to leave Soviet control in '56. Or Czechoslovakia in '68. Or Poland in the 80s. Were all of those presidents ""appeasing"" Russia? Were they living their ""lives worthless"" because they didn't want to envelope the world in a nuclear holocaust?

Or maybe, just maybe, we already had a lot of smart people analyze this stuff and found that there isn't a way to win in a war like that, no matter how morally righteous we are. Once it's started there's no way to stop it until everyone is dead.

Like it or not, Russia has nukes (and other very dangerous weapons that aren't talked about as much). Ignoring that reality is a dangerous and reckless. Putin is more than capable of using them, and if he's backed into a corner there is every incentive to use them in some way. This isn't just my opinion: most analysts and military experts have been saying this now for weeks. Even a completely rational dictator could have good reasons to use them in the right circumstances. Just because you wish that weren't so does not make it true.

However by this point Russia should have steam rolled through Ukraine.

I understand the distrust of Chinese people, and there are many good reasons for it. China has a far, far greater control over its citizens than Russia has. To begin with they have the social credit system, which rewards/punishes citizens for behavior according to what CCP deems appropriate. Second, the propaganda and brainwashing of their citizenry is far more sophisticated than that of Russia. Thirdly, China is quite well known for sending agents for espionage and to corrupt foreign institutions to suit their goals.

However, I've also come to learn that many Chinese have come to my country precisely to escape this system. Not all are brainwashed and many leave China because they can't stand a system that assigns them scores based on how ""patriotic"" they are and which determines whether or not they can apply for a bank account or even take the train in the morning. 

I don't think China will go so far as to send one Chinese person to serve in the Foreign Legions. It's simply not worth it for the little intelligence they can gain. This might be just one Chinese person who, while difficult to accept, may genuinely want to be free and to serve the cause of freedom.

,[],False,,Kalepa,,,[],,,,text,t2_6ofy5,False,False,"In the past week, former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Ivanovic said that a major problem with Russian tactics was the Russian army‘s lack of an NCO core. In the United States, the NCO corps consists of sergeants, privates, etc., and they control day-to-day operations as well as training and preparation.

Creighton Holub who joined the US army in 1998 points out the usefulness of the NCO corp and compares the effectiveness of that corp to the Russian way of doing things — hint — lack of an effective NCO corp reduces effective training, limits the ability of soldiers to function independently, etc. (See https://www.sealynews.com/news-local-news/russia-crippled-lack-ncos)

From https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/NCO-Journal/Archives/2019/March/Russian-ncos/ is this:

“The Russians have struggled with enlisted professionalization since Soviet times, and have experimented with several different models. Russia is quite aware of the US/Western model of enlisted professionalization, but this model has been evaluated and rejected for use in Russia. Although the Russian military understands the institution in the US/West, they do not think it would be a good fit for the Russian military due to different military decision-making processes, histories, and social conventions. Russia does not want well-rounded enlisted leaders, they want narrowly-focused, technically competent, professional, enlisted soldiers. Due to this very different system, Russian contract servicemen are probably more accurately described as ""enlisted professionals"" than “noncommissioned officers.””

So, Russia “does not want well-rounded enlisted leaders” and instead prefers “narrowly-focused, technically competent, professional, enlisted soldiers.” What can go wrong for the Russian army without soldiers able to operate independently, able to see and correct problems ahead of time, etc., etc.?”

We may be seeing in Russia’s invasion debacle the proof of need for a good NCO corp.

Privately held guns have NEVER protected civil and political rights. Even in your precious revolutionary war the Militia was merely cannonfodder and the war was won by the French Navy, French Army and Washington's army of Continental Regulars. None of which had personal weapons, all of which had government issue weapons. The only situation in which militia weren't slaughtered were when they were either defending a fort from frontal attack (e.g. Bunker Hill) or fought supported by regulars (e.g. Saratoga) .

Your guns do not keep your person safe, do not keep your loved ones safe, do not protect your political rights, do not protect your civil rights. A good guy with a gun doesn't stop a bad guy with a gun, a good guy runs at the first opportunity. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a trained professional with or without a gun. This is why american homicide rates and suicide rates and gun violence rates are an order of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the civilized world. 

If you have a gun in the house that gun is approximately 50 times more likely to harm or kill a family member than it is to protect a family member. 

Unless you are a trained professional, licensed hunter or living in a town with polar bears YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A GUN; PERIOD. Even then the gun should be kept far away from humans safely locked in a safe with the ammo in a different safe until you go to work, go hunting or go into bear habitat. 

Every other country has freedom, universal health care, access to abortion and virtually no guns. Indeed, not having guns makes freedom easier to keep because you don't have freedom if you are dead and disarmed extremists can be easily ignored for the fraction of a percent that they represent. 

So, get rid of your guns, they are only hurting you.

When the proposed Constitution was before the people for ratification, many anti-Federalists worried that the new government would be too powerful, and could become tyrannical. In Federalist No. 46, James Madison reassured the public that the many checks and balances in the Constitution — the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, for example — made it very unlikely that a tyrant could seize power. If a tyrant did, he would speedily be deposed by the state governments, who would lead the armed people in the militias.

""Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation,"" Madison wrote, ""the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.""

The words that confuse people the most is 'well-regulated',, which to an 18th century thinker means something completely different to what it does today. These guys had just fought a war where the primary feature was that the militia lost battles and the regulars could actually fight. Their dual concerns were an outside invasion which must be met by a competent army and an overmighty president who, if he had control of said army, would use it to oppress the people, like happened regularly here in Europe at the time. 

To make a competent army which wasn't beholden to the President they envisioned an army of state militias which could be called up when needed. For those state militias to be competent the states needed the right to form them, hence 'the people' (as in the states) had a right to form militias. These militias needed regular drill so they could be well regulated. 

Well regulated meant abiding by a regula at the time. Regula is latin for rule-book and was typically used by monastic orders. When Paul Revere went on his night ride he wasn't shouting ""The British are Coming"", Paul was, at the time a loyal British subject, he shouted ""The Regulars are Coming"". The word Regular referred to the government troops on their way to Lexington and Concord. They were called Regulars because they followed a Regula and the order that that Regula established was called a Regime in French and the grouping was referred to as a Regiment. 

The founding fathers wanted a standing army which was controlled by the states, so they added an amendment to the bill of rights asserting that the people, meaning the states, had a right to maintain state militias which the president or federal government could not abolish, you see, because there was a need for a well-regulated militia the states had the right to form and maintain those militias. 

I do want to note that all of this went out the window within 3 decades. Jefferson founded a standing army and navy (marine corps and us navy) to fight the barbary pirates, volunteer militias couldn't do that, and state militas were trouced by the one Regular british soldier with canadian militia in the war of 1812 and then a rgular british army sacked washington and was about to sack baltimore but they ran out of ammunition and that's how you got the star spangled banner.

But the russians could not resist raping 2 million german girls and women of all ages, in less that six month.. Even if all men in europe had mysteriously disappeared tomorrow, the women in europe would fight a russian invasion till death without surrender. The politicians may have too much money stuck in their ears to ""remember"". But very few europeans are able to just forget or ignore how russian identity sees everyone from the ""west"" as it's true enemy.",34b36df578a07b719fd6a0f5fd5f17bf05b1f07c,True,False,,,,,0,1647645296,,0,{},i17tbgc,False,t3_th8ibb,False,True,t1_i17pu6d,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/th8ibb/whats_the_precedent_for_this_are_all_noncitizens/i17tbgc/,1647645311,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647616496.0,,,,
