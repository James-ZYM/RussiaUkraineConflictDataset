The US produces about 33 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and uses about 30 trillion cubic feet. I don't know how much the EU uses but I'm guessing it's a smidge more than the 3 trillion cubic feet of spare US production. Yes the US could produce more but you can't just increase production by 25 or 50 percent.
 Also why would European countries buy gas from the US which would be more expensive being carried on ships as opposed to through pipes?

Trump was spot on (I know it's a strange concept that trump got something right) with this one. European countries want protection through NATO, protection solely from Russia yet keep building new pipelines from Russia thus filling Putin's war chest. 
Germany is by far the largest economy in Europe and up until very very recently had a tiny defence budget meaning they relied on NATO as well as the US nuclear umbrella for defence.

&gt; but you can’t expect Russia to respect you when you are dependent on their natural resources.

Russia will never respect the West not for the above reason but for the simple fact that they don't respect us. The Russian state doesn't respect our way of life, they don't think our way of life is viable.

The challenge with what you're saying — which is really two things... perception of Russia vs. perception of Ukraine — is that criticism of every transgression is irrelevant when it comes to survival, but Ukraine didn't start any war. The onus is not on Ukraine to make the case for survival. 

Let's look at one of the countries Nazi Germany invaded. Poland, for instance. Poland didn't deserve to be invaded and carved up, right? Well, did you know Poland's regime was pretty authoritarian and some would consider even fascist themselves? In 1926 there was a coup which replaced the previous Socialist president, who himself was in power after the previous leader was assassinated. More and more draconian control happened in Poland, banning of left wing (and some right wing anti-government types) parties. 

But nobody ever really talks about that, because they weren't the aggressors in WWII. And, if you stacked up their aggressions and transgressions, fascist Germany pretty much outranks fascist Poland by a longshot. So we don't really do ""whataboutism"" on Poland. Except maybe in Polish studies. Long after the fact. I mean, imagine if, during WWII, someone said ""but Poland was corrupt and authoritarian too"". Does that make their defense less important for a whole slew of reasons, not least of which is humanitarian?

We have the benefit of this debate because we're not there. But to people in Ukraine, it's survival. They deserve to survive. Russia has no say. No Russians were attacked until Russia got involved. Nobody \*in\* Russia even knows much about what is going on.

All the wars in Donbass and the rest of Ukraine are the fault of Russia under Putin. All those deaths from 2014-2022 would never have happened if Russia hadn't gotten their nose in there and prevented Ukraine from going to Europe like they wanted and then pretending they had to support Russians in Ukraine. Even Russian Ukrainians are announcing they don't want to be part of Russia's plans.

This is not just my perception, you can literally check any post that shows ""evil"" things done by any of the sides and the comments show exactly that, you can check posts objectively and see for yourself.
Also any post about how Russian person is evil is not automatically screamed fake, if it's other way around then we must nuke Russia.

What bothers me in this war is how fascism turned out to be something normal and we totally support it if it's aimed towards Russian speakers. Also how the world sees this war as if it started in february 2022 and all things prior to this are irrelevant, even if it was innocent children dying and Ukraine and west turning blind eye because it was good for them. People can try to downplay it, but ratio and total count of civilian casualties vs military casualties is much much higher in 2014-2021 than it is in 2022, but that fact doesn't go well with the story that Ukraine is not a fascist state and that the goverment has nothing to do with fascist bandits in their country.
