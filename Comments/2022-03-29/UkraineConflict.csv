All I can find is opinion pieces that have it in a headline but if you read it they essentially say 'he didn't say it specifically in this instance therefor I am going to assume he's against it'.

He has definitely been hard on NATO. I could go as far as seeing him bluff and make claims about backing out if other countries don't pick up their end of the agreement. Whether that would be right or wrong, I don't know. Certainly bad optics, as it would be more of a ""business style"" move rather then a presidential or political move.

But in all honesty, if you exclude the US, when he took office there was only 2 countries out of the remaining 29 that were actually meeting their obligations. Its not fair for the US taxpayers to shoulder that burden.

It would never happen (because MERICA). But if the left wants to reallocate miliary spending to social programs like healthcare etc, the best way to justify it is if the other NATO countries pick up the slack and fulfill their end of the agreement.

However, Putin IS a war criminal, he has planned and directed his forces in an international war crime, the crime of aggression, and has used war crimes, crimes against humanity and probably genocide to achieve his aims.  So call him a War Criminal.

How can calling him out for what he is be damaging to relationships when Putin as lied to the international community, the UN, and has used his appointed higher ranking officers to lie to the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.  He loses to his own people.  How can one negotiate with such an outright criminal? It's like the police negotiating with a murderer while the corpses of his victims are still warm and he's pulling the knife out!

So the likes of Macron - who think Bidden has made relationships more difficult.  There is no relationship - other than force - that is all Putin understands - brute overwhelming force - so I suggest that is the means of negotiation until the Russian people can find a ""clean skin' to bring this to an end and negotiate peace.

P.S.  Ukraine would be duped to accept a peace that suits others, especially those nations who want an end to the war to solve self-interest (rule supplies from Russia) and elections at home.

The US produces about 33 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and uses about 30 trillion cubic feet. I don't know how much the EU uses but I'm guessing it's a smidge more than the 3 trillion cubic feet of spare US production. Yes the US could produce more but you can't just increase production by 25 or 50 percent.
 Also why would European countries buy gas from the US which would be more expensive being carried on ships as opposed to through pipes?

Trump was spot on (I know it's a strange concept that trump got something right) with this one. European countries want protection through NATO, protection solely from Russia yet keep building new pipelines from Russia thus filling Putin's war chest. 
Germany is by far the largest economy in Europe and up until very very recently had a tiny defence budget meaning they relied on NATO as well as the US nuclear umbrella for defence.

&gt; but you can’t expect Russia to respect you when you are dependent on their natural resources.

Russia will never respect the West not for the above reason but for the simple fact that they don't respect us.

Self interest over fuel trumps the internationally enshrined principle of sovereignty, supposed to be upheld in no less than the UN Charter (article 51), a duty for all Member States!  

Watch out Ukraine, otherwise members of NATO (France already trying) will negotiate an end to the conflict, not because of the suffering in Ukraine, not because of Russian atrocities, but because of national self-interest over fuel supplies from Russia and raising personal political profiles.  These nations, namely Germany and France, have sucked on the ***Russian teat*** for so long they can't tell what is right and what is wrong, they don't follow international law and principles in the UN Charter.  That is why, in 2014, Russian aggression was rewarded with Crimea, and parts of Donbas Region, and that is why Putin continue until his latest war over Ukraine. ***Shame on those who sold out Ukraine!***",736f7cf7120d20ac4a497623d3f8a9683a3a141e,True,False,,,,,0,1648565810,,0,{},i2kkrfq,False,t3_tq6hsr,False,True,t3_tq6hsr,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tq6hsr/a_few_bitter_words_of_truth/i2kkrfq/,1648565826,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1648537010.0,,,,

Germany didn’t like when Poland wouldn’t take Muslim refugees that were being manufactured to saturate Europe with Muslims. Poland was willing and did donate a lot of money for the refugees but wouldn’t endanger their citizens by taking them in country. Now Poland has accepted over 2 million Ukrainian refugees from the war that Germany is financing and Germany just got financial sanctions placed on Poland for other stuff. Timing seems really bad and the fact that Germany has said they are full and won’t take any Ukrainians tells me they are still in bed with Russia.

The challenge with what you're saying — which is really two things... perception of Russia vs. perception of Ukraine — is that criticism of every transgression is irrelevant when it comes to survival, but Ukraine didn't start any war. The onus is not on Ukraine to make the case for survival. 

Let's look at one of the countries Nazi Germany invaded. Poland, for instance. Poland didn't deserve to be invaded and carved up, right? Well, did you know Poland's regime was pretty authoritarian and some would consider even fascist themselves? In 1926 there was a coup which replaced the previous Socialist president, who himself was in power after the previous leader was assassinated. More and more draconian control happened in Poland, banning of left wing (and some right wing anti-government types) parties. 

But nobody ever really talks about that, because they weren't the aggressors in WWII. And, if you stacked up their aggressions and transgressions, fascist Germany pretty much outranks fascist Poland by a longshot. So we don't really do ""whataboutism"" on Poland. Except maybe in Polish studies. Long after the fact. I mean, imagine if, during WWII, someone said ""but Poland was corrupt and authoritarian too"". Does that make their defense less important for a whole slew of reasons, not least of which is humanitarian?

We have the benefit of this debate because we're not there. But to people in Ukraine, it's survival. They deserve to survive. Russia has no say. No Russians were attacked until Russia got involved. Nobody \*in\* Russia even knows much about what is going on.

All the wars in Donbass and the rest of Ukraine are the fault of Russia under Putin. All those deaths from 2014-2022 would never have happened if Russia hadn't gotten their nose in there and prevented Ukraine from going to Europe like they wanted and then pretending they had to support Russians in Ukraine. Even Russian Ukrainians are announcing they don't want to be part of Russia's plans.
