Unfortunately to take part in a globalised economy you have to play by the rules, you cannot just have your cake and eat it. These companies will eventually ground to a halt if they cannot sell their products, which as you say are mostly exported. They are lowering their prices in Russia simply because Russians cannot afford the market prices. Costs are however the same, and how If they stop making money they cannot pay wages.

The first man is passing out and his face is swollen as fuck. I’ll stick to the opinion of the hunter I am with weekly who is on westpac chopper as a trauma medic who has watched the entire video not just these half cuts. Thanks for input.

(There's been some debate on social media as to whether the footage is genuine or staged, with some people claiming there isn't enough blood, evidence of exit wounds or shouting and screaming from the victims for it to be real.
We showed the video to several trauma surgeons and former military doctors who gave us their expert opinion but wished to remain anonymous.
One said he had treated soldiers who had sustained gunshot injuries who didn't shout or scream and said the lack of bleeding on some of the wounded soldiers could be explained by them having had a tourniquet applied (visible in the video).
He said: ""It is my opinion that the footage cannot be categorised as 'fake' purely based on the images seen. This requires an investigation for war crimes."" 
Another doctor said: ""It appears genuine... these meet the description of punishment shootings to the limbs"". The BBC has used geo-location tools to confirm the location. The area had recently been re-taken by Ukrainian troops from Russian forces. The prisoners are being questioned in Russian. A BBC Monitoring languages expert says the accents of the questioners ""are in line with what you'd expect from Ukrainians speaking Russian"".
Another expert confirmed that they seem to have eastern Ukrainian accents, pointing to the use of ""hovorit"" (""speak"") rather than the Russian ""govorit"".)

Stemming from a December 2014 article, the term ""Trolls from Olgino"" gained worldwide media attention by June 2015, when one of the offices of a Russian company named Internet Research Agency, based in Saint Petersburg, was exposed as having data from fake accounts used for Internet trolling.

I am also shooting a documentary about events that are happening at Ukraine right in front of my eyes. If you are interested, you can donate some money to the film budget. All the people who donate, will be in the titles. 

If you want to send some money, you can use PayPal or other ways of sending money, just write a direct message, I will send the requisites. 

I am also open to discussing my photos.

I'd argue no. Maintaining harsh sanctions will very likely lead to internal, elite engineered regime change. Why does this matter to ""the West""? I think teaching the Russian elite that an openly annexationist and bellicose foreign policy will not go unpunished is a good, humbling lesson for them. Puts them on notice to finally  shed any delusion of imperial grandeur. That's certainly a plus in terms of European geopolitical stability. Certainly good for Russia's immediate neighbours.

I think the Ukrainian Army have proved they are competent, I dont see them blindly attacking, and from some of the video's I have seen, are attacking strategic points, not a full on push as people think.

Also the missing factor people are not taking into account is the morale of the Russian army, and communication to their leadership. Without leadership to guide decisions and should they feel they they are facing overwhelming force, they would probably retreat.

Some 30 years ago I was an Infrantryman, Swedish army. Never saw combat, obviously. Did my service in a rifle platoon attached to an anti tank company that had TOW missiles as their main armament. My platoon's  task was employ infantry tactics against flanking attempts from enemy armor. 

In  our war stash (this just cannot be a military secret anymore) we had 5000 anti-tank mines. No kidding. 5000 for our platoon alone. I have laid so many practice mines, dug up so many practice mines, ... CLEANED so many practice mines... 

We had PLOWS for setting down mines in fields - fast. 

Now, there are many tactics we trained that I don't see from the Ukraine war reports. For example, you don't always even need to dig mines down. You can just cover them, with branches/leaves or rubbish, hay, whatever... straight on the asphalt. 

Doing this, clearly stating that there MAY be mines lying around.. messes things up for tanks. Let's say 3 out of 4 are fake: tanks will still still stop just tin case and present you with an easy shot. This way, you can mine roads and spare civilians: they will NEVER cross a road covered with pine tree twig since it's not worth takning a 25% risk of death.  You can mess things up fortther by leaving a single rifleman to guard the setup, who will step out of the vehicle to check out? One single shot is hard to locate and sniper panic will spread even if it is a miss.

Also, I see drone movies of ambushes. People jolt out of their vehicles to take cover when a convoy is attacked. Way back in the stone age when I was a soldier, we always mined the ditches and set them up for electrical detonation. Attack the convoy, wait 5 seconds, then blow up the ditches. Forgetting to mine the ditches = extra guard duty when your buddies have next wekeend leave :-)

Tactics learnt from the germans in the later stages of WW2, so while trained in a peaceful nation like Sweden it is still battle-proven.

Yeah sure. But can we make it that the winner chooses the charity? It's going to be hard for either of us to prove we made a donation but I'll take your word for it. And seeing as you took me up on it, I apologise for assuming you wouldn't. I've had too many conversations with redditors that just jump to name-calling instead of having a civil discussion about the facts and I appreciate that you didn't. If anyone else with an account over 4 years old wants to join in, feel free to comment.

&gt; 15 seconds into the video my hackles were up with what I thought were anomalies and so I stated it was fake, and reported it.

I feel like that your feelings about the war have clouded your judgment, but we'll have to wait and see. There's a couple of comments in the video thread (by other users) which I agree with, and explain why I think some of the supposed ""anomalies"" aren't really anomalies (e.g. [1][2]).

&gt; BTW, Ukraine govt issued a statement that the video was fake. FYI.

Are you referring to [this statement](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1508196787244486663) or something else? 

I'll remind you that the Ukrainian government also issued a [statement](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1497010338188857347) that all of the soldiers on Snake Island were dead.

You should also read through [this article](https://twitter.com/DavidPuente/status/1508558083978637336) by independent fact-checker David Puente (use google translate if you don't speak Italian), before we start. The 97% upvoted post we are both commenting on is part of a propaganda campaign.

In war there is no doubt that soldiers on all sides transgress at some point.  The question is by how much and how often.

Well to our best knowledge Ukraine has not kidnapped anyone, raped anyone, mutilated anyone or tortured anyone.  The worst we have seen is Ukraine soldiers berate some Russian prisoners. They have been videoed treating Russian wounded many a time although berating a person while treating him is not my recommended course of treatment - the anger does show sometimes. Ukraine has witnessed butchery inflicted on its people - [here](https://twitter.com/MaximEristavi/status/1507458410958184455) is a great example and I have many more that I have saved since the war started.

Here is another interesting little tidbit that everyone either does not know or chooses to gloss over.  The Azov battalion is not the only Ukraine Combat Battalion in Mariupol.  In fact there are 2 Ukraine Combat Battalions: the Azov Battalion and a Marine Battalion.  

The Azov commander is a Major, and he is subordinate to the Marine commander, who is a Lieutenant Colonel.  The Marine commander is the one giving the orders on what to do, where and when.  In almost every video I have seen of Ukraine forces in action in Mariupol I have seen men from both units.  And all of them are always in full regular military uniform.

One of the many mistakes in this video is that the men who were pretending to be ""Azov"" were not in correct uniform.  It was easily spotted immediately.  Go look at any of the videos of Ukraine soldiers in Mariupol.  They are always fully rigged out and in proper uniform.  And its how they wear it.  When you have been a solider you know because its ingrained in training.

So in respect of the contention about if you have enough apples you know some of them are going to be rotten:  well there is sometimes some truth to that.  Living in one of the primary apple growing areas of the world I also know sometimes its not true.  And if everything is done according the the rules and guidelines it is usually rare, and often avoidable, weather being the monkey wrench and out of our control.",e5633b431982ea2971221095cde4ec970876208a,True,False,,,,,0,1648528016,,0,{},i2iyu5s,False,t3_tqd0yi,False,True,t1_i2irw57,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tqd0yi/anonymous_has_revealed_an_important/i2iyu5s/,1648528026,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1648499216.0,,,,

For example, blanks don't have significant recoil, and that shot clearly did. Live ammo produces sparks too, and even a blank would fuck someone up at that range. That looks like a real gunshot to me.

Also, there's nothing weird about a Ukrainian soldier using a Russian-made handguard on his rifle, or even just using a Russian gun. They've captured thousands of them, probably including from the prisoners in the video.

The blood on the ground doesn't look like a ""blood bag"" squirted on the ground; it looks like blood that's running down an incline. You can actually see that happening with another stream of blood a few seconds later. 

There's nothing improbable about that amount of blood, either. Take a liter of water and spill it on the ground. Splash it around a little. Makes a huge mess, right? A liter is considered relatively minor blood loss, but it looks like a **lot** when it's spread all over the ground.

What's more, the original video is quite long, and doesn't have many cuts (or any, if I'm remembering correctly). It's difficult to choreograph a long scene like that with actual actors, much less some random mooks in the middle of a warzone. That would be VERY hard to shoot convincingly.

That was totally a blank firing in the video,  and the orientation of the flash reveals the rifle wasn't even pointed at anyone that was in frame,  and definitely not at the soldier that fell to the ground immediately when the shot went off.

Also, haven't seen a single weapon in any of the videos of Ukrainian soldiers that look like the one used in the video. 

And the video is oddly close in on the action,  and there is no blood running from visible wounds, it all runs from underneath soldiers. Blood pools in clothing and around the edges of the individual when the wound is against the ground.

The amount of blood seen running does not jive with the quiet nature of the 'injured' or the lack of gaping wounds in the video.",1944b8e625e1acf14af8001674e903ed47429e08,True,False,,,,,0,1648520090,,0,{},i2ik9fn,False,t3_tqghse,False,False,t1_i2i8l4w,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tqghse/nice_try_russian_propagandists_but_you_failed/i2ik9fn/,1648520106,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1648491290.0,,,,

There is no sunflower seed oil, and barely any other plant oil. But it's not like it's rationed ""you can only buy one litre per month"" or some shit. It's simply an empty shelf, and some other options like olive oil or butter or palm fat. A tiny inconvenience for us here, and no surprise because there is a full scale war going on just two state borders from us. Nobody whines about it.

My friends from another city mentioned flour is gone in their store. In ours it wasn't. You can still order any food you want in a restaurant, and buy all kinds of flour containing produces in the supermarket. No rationing. Just some crazy people who think it's time to play pepper, like they already did when Corona hit.

Might be a little grim of me to say but I live in a first world country in a post-colonial world in which we can buy the grain off of poorer countries. Our news have already mentioned that the real hunger crisis will be in Africa, and that the situation there is concerning.

What hurts us more here is that the oil and gas price goes up, which will have an effect on every single thing we consume. Groceries will be a lot more expensive in the future not because of a grain crisis but because the transport and refining of products will be a lot more expensive.

I live in a rich country, and I'm belonging to the lower class. The place I live at is shit, high crime neighborhood. I spend most of my money on food and rent. I'm still not scared to starve.
