The *factual* content of the post was about the subtleties of Russian propaganda and how people can unintentionally contribute to it.  

If I read your comment correctly, you seem to be of the *realpolitik* school of thought. By that I mean, your support for Ukraine is based on your (i.e., your country's) interests, not on a moral imperative. That's where we differ. I think the facts you've cited exist within a moral context, and Russia's invasion implies a moral imperative to oppose it. That doesn't negate thinking critically about it or ignoring complexity, by the way.

Your most interesting comment, I think, is that you say ""NATO expansion is the main driver of the conflict."" That is a very interesting claim.

That's something that often happens in political even paramilitary organizations simply because of the nature of politics and human behavior. ""If they pay for us to play nice showing the door to some hardliners is an easy choice"".   


Something really similar happened to Hungary's ""Jobbik"" party which was far right then made a turn to  the centrum, the hardliners were ejected (They formed a new party later on) the rest of it reformed into a modern conservative party without the racist/nationalist overtones.

Your post directly forces one side's viewpoint as unconditionally correct, even in the title as almost everyone pointed out.

Further the examples you listed are all true statements to which you infer your interpretation as fact. Just like Putin did in his speech, by the way.
NATO expansion is the main driver of this conflict, expansion is fine with me as long as we don't trigger a nuclear exchange, I wish we could squeeze China the same way we do Russia.
Azov and other far right extremist groups are operating within Ukrainian National Guard since 2015, I see no justification for that and regret my government didn't put conditions on aid to get rid of that type of scum years ago.
USA most definitely did invade Iraq illegally and under false pretense of WMDs, which has little to do with Russia invading Ukraine since two wrongs don't make a right.

If you want to promote Ukraine's interests you should rather focus on presenting true facts about this war than tell people how to interpret them.

A video like this comes out (talking out how bad is Ukrainian forces are) = Pro-Russian Propaganda! Fuck off, where is the proof?!  
A video like this comes out (talking about how bad Russian forces are) = yes, those bastards! TRUTH!  
The real shit is that we have no idea what's going on, because the same videos surface where people talk or show what shit both sides are doing, and it all cant be justified for the war!  
there will be real interviews or videos where Azov/Ukrainian Forces doing horrifying shit, hiding in civilian clothes, civilian houses, hiding in hospitals, putting their tanks in playgrounds = Pro-Russian propaganda! Where is the Proof? This is fake! (and it will get dissected to the extreme).  
there will be real interviews or videos with Russian Forces doing bad stuff, anything, kicking a puppy, anything without proof or confirmation = FUCK RUSSIA! KILLERS! THEY KILL BABIES!  
Videos surface where people talk or show what shit both sides are doing, and just putting aside everything that Ukraine is doing and making it a norm and justifying it = that is Pro-West propaganda working.  
Because it is war, and it didn't begin in 1 day and it didn't begin because Putin is crazy - besides my birth language I know Russian language and some Ukrainian and some Belarus and some English, and I can tell you that it really helps to see the truth around all of this propaganda... because I can dig deeper and see that this conflict started since 1991 and aggression was from Ukraine to Russia and there is so many political/financial situations where USA would be involved and NATO involved, and there were talks and agreements between all of them and Russia, and Russia been fucked over and so on for many years.  
In East Ukraine, there is a Dombas region where Domas people voted to be 2 separate Republics, but Ukraine didn't like that (as Ukraine is not a democratic country) so they started cutting Dombas from civilization (cutting off gas, electricity, pensions etc.)  
Russia was involved in to this in 2014-2015 - there was an agreement made by Russian-Ukraine to leave Dombas as a separate republic and withdraw Ukranin Forces from Dombas, but the next day Ukranin Forces started bombing Dombas... for 8 years.   
So in these 8 years, a lot of Dombas people wanted to merge with Russia and a lot of them had Russian Nationality made - so now Ukraine was killing Russians...  
It is much MUCH more complicated than we are being shown here in EU (probably in USA as well).  
So what I can say is that everyone who shouts = THIS IS RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA.  
I have news for you = you got brainwashed by WEST PROPAGANDA.  
East Ukraine had been destroyed by West Ukraine for a long time and has been sponsored by USA - not a conspiracy theory, it's true..  
As both sides are lying HARD!  
Ukrainian Forces and Azov are doing horrible shit for 8 years straight. (and this is not coming form only Russian propaganda but from known people in Ukraine and videos of independent people in Dombas)   
So stop believing that you guys know everything, and anything you see or read that doesn't agree with your washed brain is Russian Propaganda.  
War is horrible, and if Russia would have had much better political influence - this could be evaded or maybe not - who knows!   
Russia started a war, because of the ongoing conflicts since 1991 with Ukraine. With envolment of USA/NATO.  
War is horrible and people suffer!  
This war started because of conflicts and political shit that has been ongoing for many years, and for many politicians in Ukraine and Russia, it is not a shock that it eventually started!  
Poor people in Ukraine (mostly near the Russian border, Dombas.) are suffering because of being in the middle of the fighting and getting bombed by Ukraine and by Russia.  
This war was more beneficial for Ukraine, to speed up its process to get itself in EU and get help from USA/NATO. (As the Ukrainian president first asked for Weapons from NATO and NATO or EU membership, as well asked it, people, to take arms ""becoming a meat shield"", he only started talking about evacuation a week in to war)  
For Russia war is beneficial so they can get more land with valuable resources and get Ukraine to be Neutral (not join NATO).  
And Let the ""Russian Bot, Pro-Russian Propoganda"" Comments start :)  
Because you guys can't accept the reality, better to believe everything you are fed because it's simple - but everything else is complicated.",ad51ad8e94592814b83ea1b1e1d79a26760e460f,True,True,,,,,0,1648560863,,0,{},i2k8x9e,False,t3_tqdbwa,False,True,t3_tqdbwa,/r/war/comments/tqdbwa/alexander_sleptsov_is_another_victim_of_ukrainian/i2k8x9e/,1648560875,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648532063.0

I don't care about Ukranians i don't either like them or hate them, my country never had any interaction with them. But we have a bloody past with Russians throughout our history. I don't fall for the Western propaganda. We all know that Zelensky is a puppet of the USA. Guy don't even have a proper politician history he was an Actor/Comedian before he became president. I don't even understand how he became the president. I don't know how things are going in China but whenever i check the media i see ""poor Ukranians, big bad Russians shooting civilians, Ukranians killed Russians like this and that, Russia are bad like this and that"". Dude Russia is muted by the media. Have your ever seen Putin talking on news or internet? But on the other hand Zelensky is EVERYWHERE. And he always cry and cry. How can Russians do propaganda if they can't even reach me? But on the other hand NATO propaganda is fucking everywhere. This is how ""Brainwashing"" works and you are falling for it. They say Russians are hitting schools and hospitals. Because Ukranian soldiers are hiding there thinking Russians won't shoot because those are hospitals and Schools. (Proof: [https://mobile.twitter.com/Za\_Russians/status/1499033461092491272](https://mobile.twitter.com/Za_Russians/status/1499033461092491272)) Wherever i look i see how Ukranians kicked Russians like this and that and how Ukranians are so strong. If they were so strong they wouldn't hire Neo-Nazi group ""AZOVS"" to fight for themselves, they wouldn't keep asking other countries guns and help. This is kinda NATO vs Russia but without Nato's actual personel presence. And everyone i mean EVERYONE is falling for the Western propaganda. Ukraine is not innocent, they asked it for themselves. Of fucking course i don't approve civil killings i don't want to see people suffer but this is war. And you can't blame the fire for you touching it. There are lots of videos and photos showing that Ukranians giving food to surrendered Russians but you can't ever see these video anywhere because of the Nato propaganda/Brainwashing.

Ukraine was a corrupt Russian vassal state with an elected pro Russian government from 1991 until 2014. In 2011 new oil deposits were discovered. The US made a grab for Ukrainian resources by financing a successful a coup in 2014. (One year prior to the scheduled election.) That was followed by money laundering between US politicians and Ukrainians. 

Russia opposed the coup and immediately started a civil war to to keep those resources. They set the battle lines on the Left and Right Bank divide of the Dnieper River that separated historic Russian territory from historic Ukrainian territory. They were successful in Crimea, and semi successful in Donetsk and Luhansk. Mariupol and Odessa were quickly pacified by Ukraine.  

Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk have been fighting the civil war since 2014.  Ukraine was targeting civilians in an effort to ethnically cleanse Russian civilians from those territories, with Russians providing weapons and advisors. When Biden became president, in 2021, he sent advanced US weapons and green beret advisors to assist Ukraine in its 8 year old civil war. Seeing the impending loss of resources and doom of Russian civilians, Russia invaded.

If you look at war maps, you will see that except for cutting off Kiev, for strategic reasons, the invasion stopped at the historic Left Bank of the Dnieper. Russia is planning on keeping the Left Bank as an independent Vassal state, or absorbing it like they did with Crimea. Logically they would want to limit damages and civilian casualties in those regions. Ukraine on the other hand, knowing it will lose those regions are performing a scorched earth retreat to cause s much pain to Russia as possible. Azov, has been at the forefront of Ukraine's ethnic cleansing efforts and stated they will kill as many Russian civilians as they can and raze the cities, rather than surrender them. 

No side is innocent in this grab for resources. Not the corrupt US politicians for starting the civil war and later inflaming it further, so their sons can continue laundering billions of dollars. Not the US puppet Ukrainian government that wants to genocide it's Russian population for wanting to secede with the resources. And not the Russians for backing and supplying the rebels, and later invading to keep those resources. 

It is a shit show all around, but the truth of what each of the three sides is doing is being hidden by propaganda.
