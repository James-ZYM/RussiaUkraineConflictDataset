You misunderstand how foreign policy works in the US. The rag that was linked is published by the Council of Foreign Relations, a think tank. There are numerous of these types of institutions all over DC. The Atlantic Council, The RAND Corporation, Brookings Institute etc, are all groups that are allied with US government entities. They don't get sacked when a new president comes in. They are advisers to government workers, cabinet officials, etc. Even within the state department, national security council, department of defense, etc, the lower level workers don't get fired every four years. To get one of these jobs, you better come from Havard or Yale. These people socialize with each other, intermarry, and give each other jobs. What you've got is what Ben Rhodes called ""The Blob"". It doesn't go anywhere. 

Foreign policy in the US is consistent. Let's take the Iran nuclear deal. Yea, Obama signed it, then instantly undermined it. Part of the deal was the US was not allowed to discourage other countries from doing business with Iran. We did that and more. We threatened anyone who wanted to do business with Iran even though we signed that deal. Trump's language was belligerent to be sure, but it was a far more honest position. Ultimately, it had the same outcome. Pretend you follow the treaty or just openly say you don't care about the treaty - same outcome.

People in the US are always more focused on how people present themselves and what they say rather than considering the totality of what they do. When one looks at the actual actions taken, there is little difference in foreign policy outcomes. Of course, that makes sense, when looking at international relations, you have to toss out the ideology and look at things through the lens of national interest. That interest isn't going to change dramatically barring a major event. Personalizing foreign relations is a mistake people make because Americans tribalize everything. It gets old.

A few things. Yes, contemporary historians understand that the Century of Humiliation was largely directed at the Europeans and Japanese, however, I highly disagree that it's not being redirected towards the US and conflated as the ""West"" in today's environment. Rhetoric is largely tied to the US being the historical ""West"" and thus the humiliation. In fact, a few posts above, a comment references the US subjugating China as if the US was a major player or contributor to anything with the Boxer Rebellion.

&gt;From a strictly historical perspective, China is both of those. From that perspective, it was inappropriate for any European powers to intervene. 

Secondly, the concept of nationhood was largely a new concept, born with the wave of nationalism during the early 1900s. To handwave away and use the narrative when it suits the fluid amalgamation of what was ""China"" at the time is dishonest. When the concept of the Century of Humiliation was invented, the Manchus who subjugated the Han were the foreigners and the imperalist invaders, literally. Yet it is the Qing as a political entity that was the closest thing to a nation at the time. It is important to get the various actors right and the various relationships different parties had with each other.

&gt;The argument isn't saying that no Europeans or Western powers didn't support China (because even extremists would agree that trade benefited China to some extent), it's saying that other countries exploited China for their own use.

I definitely do not disagree that countries exploited China for their own use.

In geopolitics, reducing and dismissing everything down to the lack of good intentions instead of end results or actions is really silly, of course nations act when interests align and not simply out of the good of their hearts.",ea2f3d381bdab4185239553a66a347c39586cc6c,True,False,,,,,0,1649283248,,0,{},i3oqety,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3oho9l,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3oqety/,1649283266,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649254448.0

Very debatable. This agreement was proposed and agreed upon between Western countries, without the input of China at all (first sign that the agreement is not about recognizing China's sov). It ended territorial colonial ambitions but rather because the diplomatic negotiations helped the European powers recognize that they had more to gain by exploiting China's economy and market rather than land.

While you definitely have a point about the Century of Humiliation being overly used, you have several historical misunderstandings about this concept, as it is commonly used in popular Chinese discourse.

\&gt;It's a made up revisionism that inconsistently applies the US with the West and their various relations against a changing definition of China depending on whatever is convenient.

  
The Century of Humiliation focuses on European powers and the Japanese specifically. While the US did participate in it, in popular discourse (which is what you critique), it is most commonly used against European powers and more specifically Japan. In official speak, it is also used to garner support and goodwill between China and other Global South nations.

Rarely (i.e. not commonly) is it used against the US

\&gt;Is China the Qing Dynasty (Manchus who subjugated the Han)? If so then many European powers were helping China with its internal conflicts. Or is China the people like Sun Yat Sen who the US also supported who wanted to create the concept of a Chinese nation via a republic? Similarly the US also implemented the Open Door Policy that prevented European powers from carving up China like Africa.  


From a strictly historical perspective, China is both of those. From that perspective, it was inappropriate for any European powers to intervene. And moreover, European powers intervened not to help Sun Yat-Sen of any Chinese republicans but to continue exploiting China. Likewise, the US proposed (and it wasn't fully implemented in any manner, simply look at Russian and Japanese intrusions into China and the lack of Chinese sovereignty in the signing of the Versailles Treaty) the Open Door policy not actually for the benefit of China but rather because if they didn't propose it, they would be at a disadvantage in trade relations compared to other European colonial powers. In other words, all their actions were for selfish actions and not out of any thought for China and it certainly didn't benefit China in the end.

\&gt;Even though the US has generally propped up Chinese statehood internationally and economic development

This is the central misunderstanding of the Century of Misunderstanding argument. The argument isn't saying that no Europeans or Western powers didn't support China (because even extremists would agree that trade benefited China to some extent), it's saying that other countries exploited China for their own use.

America doing the Open Door policy - so that they could exploit China on the same level as other European powers

American supporting ROC - so that they can maintain their own anti-communist stance for domestic popularity

America helping China open up - so that they can get cheap products at the expense of Chinese workers getting minimal wages

It's not about the end result but rather the intentions involved.",7ad6854e48df9111faaa1f045928e0b491848892,True,False,,,,,0,1649279758,,0,{},i3oho9l,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3ngs5x,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3oho9l/,1649279776,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649250958.0

You'll notice that the focus is on the ""now"" and on the local politics of who did what for why... but here's the key quote that should paint the real picture for you:

&gt;Under both Republican and Democratic leadership, the United States has viewed the TAPI pipeline as a potential key to economic strength and independence for Central Asia.

&gt;In October 2020, when Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump was in office, the United States hosted its first trilateral meeting with Afghanistan and Turkmenistan where the countries agreed to “Work together to identify and implement infrastructure projects, including projects for the sharing of energy resources such as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP) power project and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project.” (here, here , here )

&gt;According to the State Department spokesperson: “The United States has long supported efforts by Afghanistan and its Central Asian neighbors to strengthen their connectivity, increase trade, boost economic coordination, and improve regional transportation infrastructure, including energy infrastructure – in part to make Afghanistan more self-sufficient. Our priority in Afghanistan is a just and durable peace, and we recognize that peace and economic development are mutually reinforcing.”",669d532465a9f5dddb91920110aced274a805071,True,False,,,,,0,1649275870,,0,{},i3o79t2,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3o57nm,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3o79t2/,1649275882,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649247070.0

[],False,,cavscout43,,,[],,,,text,t2_gi2ef,False,False,"&gt;So in what way might the United States have provoked Putin? One thing needs to be clear: it was not by threatening the security of Russia. Since the end of the Cold War, the Russians have objectively enjoyed greater security than at any time in recent memory. Russia was invaded three times over the past two centuries, once by France and twice by Germany. During the Cold War, Soviet forces were perpetually ready to battle U.S. and NATO forces in Europe. Yet since the end of the Cold War, Russia has enjoyed unprecedented security on its western flanks, even as NATO has taken in new members to its east. 

Me thinks this is a ""classic"" hard power take on security; a wealthy and western aligned, democratic Ukraine may very much be a regime threat to Putin by serving as a very obvious example that the most ""Russian"" non-Russian country can share in the EU's prosperity and that it's not constrained by culture.   


Putin's failure to deliver meaningful middle class prosperity, oil driven GDP gains on paper (and oligarch bank accounts) aside, means it'll be harder and harder to cling to power if all former Soviet Satellites become more democratic by the year.   


&gt;It is easy to see why Washington felt no great compulsion to drive NATO eastward. Few Americans at that time saw the organization as a bulwark against Russian expansion, much less as a means of bringing Russia down. From the U.S. perspective, Russia was already a shell of its former self.

That short-sightedness certainly shows that ignorance of geopolitics doesn't mean they don't exist.   


&gt;The question was whether NATO had any mission at all now that the great adversary against which it was aimed had collapsed—and given just how hopeful the 1990s felt to most Americans and western Europeans.

It serves as the military arm of globalization, albeit run by the US. So far, it's served economic growth via security guarantees quite well, especially paired with the EU and NAFTA type economic blocs. The problem of course is that it's grown and morphed significantly; from literally being a North Atlantic alliance to protect against Soviet expansion, to a more ""Democratic country military club"" that can include Japan, South Korea, and Australia/New Zealand in the fold. Far beyond the Atlantic.   


&gt;The coming years would prove not only that going to war was a mistake but also that the Japanese would indeed have served their interests better by simply integrating themselves into the liberal order from the beginning, as they did quite successfully after the war....Putin’s Russia has made much the same choice as did imperial Japan, Kaiser Wilhelm II’s Germany, and many other dissatisfied powers throughout history, and likely with the same end—eventual defeat. But Putin’s choice should hardly have come as a surprise. Washington’s protestations of goodwill, the billions of dollars it poured into the Russian economy, the care it took in the early post–Cold War years to avoid dancing on the Soviet Union’s grave—all this had no effect, because what Putin wanted could not be granted by the United States. He sought to reverse a defeat that could not be reversed without violent force, but he lacked the wherewithal to wage a successful war. He wanted to restore a Russian sphere of interest in central and eastern Europe that Moscow had lost the power to sustain.

I don't like that this implies it's solely a ""Putin"" thing, and not the general billionaire/former KGB oligarchy that runs Russia today having limited options to preserve their own personal wealth and fortunes. Likewise, Russia is a bit of a prisoner of their geography; lots of cold, poorly connected steppe terrain, low population density, few year-round rivers or warm water ports, and so on. The prospect of Western integration does indeed suggest being a ""little Russia"" always the weak economic partner, getting plundered as they were in the 90s. A classic authoritarian regime that maintains control of their strategic resources and weaponizes them seems like a better option to Moscow.   


I'm not sure what the ""right"" answer is. The US tried to prop up a democratic / neo-liberal Russia in the 90s spending tens of billions, and it inexorably drifted back to authoritarianism and state capitalism. US policy is very delicate around nuclear powers (Pakistan being a good example) and trying to keep them from outright collapsing due to proliferation concerns. It may be time for the US to try a different approach and use their vast geopolitical arsenal to try and break up the Russian state for once and for all.",dd8416d87f8f96f02a0ad49256335ce61938d601,True,False,,,,,0,1649264667,,0,{},i3ncwt4,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t3_txmq2k,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3ncwt4/,1649264685,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649235867.0

I feel like this is still following the Russian narrative.

In the days before the retreat, Ukraine was already pushing out Russia and taking back territories around Kyiv. We saw signs of Russia setting up for defense(building barriers and trenches on their front-lines), and yet that still wasn't enough to hold whatever territory they had 'captured'. We saw the danger of Russian troops about to be cut off from their supply lines.

At what point can we say that the decision to retreat is no longer an 'independent' decision and simply a direct consequence of being pushed out? I'll admit i'm no army general, but it quite feels like Russia had the choice between an orderly retreat now, or a rout in a few days/weeks.

So these Russian troops definitely got pushed out by Ukraine.

It takes an immense amount of power and stupidity to maintain consistent control over so many differing priorities and points of view and attempting to do so is a fools errand that eventually turns the whole world against you and results in you losing a world war.

What the US is doing which is WAY smarter is keeping its knife sharp and when things outside its cave get too far out of whack for it's liking, it comes out, stabs a few likely suspects, growls about being forced to come out of its cave and warns everyone that they should avoid letting things get this stupid in the future to avoid a repeat.

That's what happened in both world wars, it's what happened with the war on terrorism and it's what's happening with Russia right now.

If you are scary enough when you come out of the cave then for the most part everyone else does their part to police themselves which is how the US actually wants the world to work and is for the most part how we police things at home.

Americans could reduce the severity of these challenges by wielding U.S. influence more consistently and effectively. They failed to do this in the 1920s and 1930s, allowing aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan to go unchecked until it resulted in a massively destructive world war. They failed to do so in recent years, allowing Putin to seize more and more land until he invaded all of Ukraine. After Putin’s latest move, Americans may learn the right lesson.

Even if you educate people extensively, they still are people...which means they'll take from you first often enough that all the communal love and sharing that occurs in some places is for naught on the largest scales.

I've occasionally thought that we could organize at massive scales to combat the effects of ""taking"" but centralized communism is simply useless in the face of humanity and blended socialism is a good start but really doesn't do a damn thing about the core issue.

I like that the US has or at least had a propaganda level belief in righteous manifest destiny caring for all people blah blah blah.  The ideology itself at the top level led to some good things and might have led further, but the US seems to be on a road away from adoption of the concepts at a strength level where they could be forced on others.

One of the potential silver linings to the war in Ukraine is that people might pick that back up, the belief in leaving people alone enforced by the strongest powers.  At the top people are still taken advantage of and geopolitics is still a thing, but there's an occasional dose of geopolitics being used to chase foolish ideologies that believe in a better world.

Mr. Khan however disagrees and has instructed his followers not to attack the military, instead blaming foreign interference from the United States in a conspiracy to depose him. He has also suggested that he may refuse to step down if the vote of no confidence succeeds due to this supposed foreign meddling.  Many fear that these events can cause further instability in Pakistan

It seems that in the wake of this conflict China, Russia, Iran and Turkey have thrown their lot in with Khan and condemned the alleged US plot to depose him. This raises questions about the potential geopolitical impacts of the resolution of the political conflict in Pakistan:

 if Khan wins will he move away from the US and closer to China? Will this change Pakistan's mostly neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict?

So a westerner may double their salary, but an Indian/Nepalese worker will quadruple their salary. However because one is earning £500 a month and the other is earning £10,000 a month it looks like exploitation. It is in fact just basic capitalism - supply and demand - with an extremely Liberal immigration system that people in the west can't fathom (in terms of numbers, more than migrant rights). In theory everyone wins. Of course there are numerous issues wrt the enforcement of employment rights and worker exploitation, but generally they're a small minority of cases (still a decent number given the huge migrant populations).

Also worth noting there is a lot of variety between the gulf states themselves. 

Rich and Conservative - Kuwait and Saudi

Rich and more Liberal - Qatar and the UAE (though very dependent on which emirate. Some are poor - ras Al khaimah, umm Al quwain - and Abu Dhabi is rich. Dubai isn't that rich but is probably the most Liberal)

Roman Empire, Tang Dynasty China, etc. What usually happens next is that these societies ossify until they are conquered by “barbarians”. 

But I think the Western countries should fare extremely well and will continue to increase in population. The US is below replacement, so the current native population should continue to decline, but due to immigration the US is expected to increase in population to 571M by 2100, mostly from South America/Asia in the early part of the century and then Africa for the rest of the century. The EU will receive immigrants predominantly from Eastern Europe and the Middle East in the early part of the century and then from Africa for the rest of the century. 

If current trends continue, my rough estimates for American are that in 2100, Whites would be a plurality at roughly 200M, Hispanics would number roughly 175M, Blacks would number roughly 121M, and Asians would number roughly 75M. 

This is a far better situation than East Asian countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan who are not willing to take immigrants. They will see their populations decrease dramatically. China will drop from 1.4B to 732M! 

China has only been able to close the gap with America because it has 4x the US population, it still has a much lower GDP per capita. If China’s GDP per capita remains significantly lower than America’s, and America reaches almost the same population as China, China will never surpass the US.",535c767afdbe801addf88878c51cbf9e8cfa6bb4,True,False,,,,,0,1649217587,,0,{},i3l1ih3,False,t3_twvggr,False,True,t3_twvggr,/r/geopolitics/comments/twvggr/demographic_collapse_in_the_modern_world/i3l1ih3/,1649217605,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649188787.0

What you will find will happen in the longer run as new technologies come about, that allow the young to move around more easily, and become more independent and self-reliant, is that if the young are enslaved too much the young will just move.

It's already happening in fact. So many of the younger generation are already looking for alternative styles of living - many countries already suffer from all their young moving abroad.
