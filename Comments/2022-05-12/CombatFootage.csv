The production standards are better and they aren't using dogshit shells from the Soviet era. The M777 also has come crazy rocket propelled GPS guided round that the Russians aren't even close to matching.  Both have laser guided shells, but again, the western ones are better and the west can actually afford to field them in Ukraine in enough quantity to make a difference.  

The shell power won't be a big change, but the American shells allegedly have better fuses, which is important for artillery. They'll be able to select an appropriate shell to match the effect on target they want. This will be important when assaulting trenches.  The Russian shells apparently saturate a whole area, barely hit anything, and when they do hit, the shell will drive into the ground and less shrapnel will hit the soldiers. The 155MM shells are just better quality and the Ukrainians will be able to select high quality proximity fuses so that when it hits (and it WILL hit accurately), it will be devastating.

32,[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"For those wanting to know why US Army brass in particular chose such a horrible location for COP placement, especially in places like COP Keating in Kamdesh, I've written about this in the past [in this post directly about COP Keating in Kamdesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/hl3bof/comment/fwx3ygz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), as well as the overall strategy and decision making in regards to COP selection in Afghanistan [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/hnxiop/why_did_they_place_cop_keating_in_afghanistan_at/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/phtzrr/comment/hblniej/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

Summation: 

\- COIN doctrine pushes a population centric approach, and the people lived in the valleys, not the ridgelines. 

\- Many COPs were built on existing Provincial Reconstruction Team bases, a pure ""win hearts and minds"" campaign done earlier in the war before the insurgency flared up badly and the areas of operation turned into a shooting gallery that had units involved in Troops in Contact (TIC) with the enemy almost daily. So they weren't sited and built with the intention of any focus on resisting enemy attacks. 

\- Logistically, building COPs on the high ground was beyond what the US Army controlling Regional Command-East in particular were willing to put into it. The valley floor COPs were already on flattish land easy to build on, near the roads they needed for ground transportation, and didn't require a massive construction effort using heavy equipment to flatten enough ridgelines or mountain tops, build switchback roads down to the valley roads, etc. Military engineer units could have done it with airlifted heavy equipment, but there weren't enough and they were mostly doing EOD shit, so ISAF hired local Afghan construction companies of dubious ability and punctuality to build them, with a lot of the work actually done by combat units occupying them who didn't really know what they were doing, quick to call it a day, lacked resources, etc. Additionally, to make high ground COPs work, they need way more helicopters than they possessed; not that they weren't nearly utterly dependent on them for resupply for the valley floor COPs, but 

\- When platoon and company sized COPs didn't hold the high ground they tried to build squad or platoon sized observation posts on them. COP Keating had one, but the problem was it was so far away and due to the contours of the ground didn't even have eyes on COP Keating; THEY COULDN'T EVEN SEE IT TO SUPPORT IT. Also, when COP Keating was attacked, so was the OP, which was suppressed and unable to provide mortar fire or send dismounts on foot to relieve the attack until it was over. 

\- Most of the decision makers involved in all of this, lieutenant colonels to major generals at the battalion to division level, were not living on these platoon or company sized COPs, nor were they even in Afghanistan when their poor decision making finally came back to bite ISAF in the ass. So for instance, COP Keating had been run for 4 deployments before the 4th ID cav guys got attacked and nearly overrun. Everyone since the 2nd deployment knew it was a terrible location but squadron, brigade, and division leadership controlling RC-East only made the decision during the 3rd deployment to shut it down. But then they had to postpone that because they didn't have necessary helicopter lift capacity to move everything, because they didn't have enough airlit capabilities altogether, and what they did have was largely committing to ongoing operations to find a US Army deserter (which tied up a lot of air support), so they waited. 

\- The real criminal who needed to be shot was the troop commanding officer, who had been relieved of duty only a few weeks before the attack for incompetence. That individual was turned every proactive measure his subordinates requested. They wanted to be allowed to launch raids against local insurgent bed down locations, which he denied. They wanted to more aggressively patrol the surrounding high ground, which he denied. They wanted to rebuild the defenses on the base to make them stronger, to move obvious positions like the gun trucks (which had been in the same spot for years), they wanted to break out ammo from the ASP and stage more of it around the COP, and he denied it all. After he was relieved they were waiting on a new troop commander (troop is the US Army cavalry scout equivalent of an infantry company), but he hadn't arrived yet, so the XO was in charge. After the battle and the deployment ended, the relieved captain whose personal actions resulted in the battle, was promoted to Major, given a lifetime achievement for professional excellence by the US Army Armor branch when he retired, and is now currently employed by the US Army as a ""

“Since its creation in 2006, Combat Outpost Keating (COP Keating) was declared by almost every arriving U.S. soldier to be a terrible location for a base. With soaring mountains looming high above it, the base was vulnerable to fire from a multitude of positions on the rocky slopes above. Even worse, the rough road leading to the base – once used by armored Humvees and Afghan “jingle trucks” bringing supplies – was no longer used due to the persistent threat of ambush and the frequent washouts. All supplies now arrived by helicopter at night. 

Deep within Afghanistan’s rugged Nuristan province, COP Keating was first considered a base from which U.S. Army counterinsurgency efforts could win local Afghan villagers’ hearts and minds through funded improvement projects. However, these counterinsurgency efforts had produced little long-term benefit as the villagers could not, or would not, stop the Taliban and other local warriors from moving through their towns and trails. Given its glaring defensive weaknesses and lack of a compelling mission, the Army had approved a plan to elimiate the base in August of 2009. Unfortunately, the evacuation plan postponed due to a lack of available heavy-lift helicopters and simmering tensions between President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who was concerned that the U.S. president’s commitment to Afghanistan’s security was waning.  “

“The Battle of Kamdesh occurred on October 3, 2009, when a force of 300 Taliban assaulted the American Combat Outpost (""COP"") Keating near the town of Kamdesh in Nuristan Province in eastern Afghanistan. The attack was the bloodiest battle for US forces since the Battle of Wanat in July 2008, which occurred 20 miles (32 km) away from Kamdesh. The attack on COP Keating resulted in 8 Americans killed and 27 wounded while the Taliban suffered an estimated 150 killed.

After an investigation, four officers in the chain of command were disciplined for their failure to adequately support the base. Eight aviators were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for helping defend the base. Staff Sergeant Clinton Romesha and Staff Sergeant Ty Carter were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the battle.”",11721b564848e6ada2a1b61493dce5f4afec18d3,True,False,,,,,0,1652396195,,0,{},i8dpw55,True,t3_uod668,False,True,t3_uod668,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uod668/fourth_infantry_division_in_the_bottom_of_a/i8dpw55/,1652396206,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652367395.0,

In parts of the countryside, but not in the cities, and not in all of the countryside.

Like many parts of Eastern Europe, different languages were spoken in close proximity to one another. Polish was the major language of Lviv. Russian was the major language of cities like Kiev, Odessa and Kharkov. Ukrainian was the major language of much of the peasantry.

&gt; Most nations have their own language that the majority speaks. French speak French, Lithuanians speak Lithuanian, Germans speak German

This is a relatively recent phenomenon. There used to be a few major languages in France, including Occitan, Breton, Basque, Allemannic German and many different varieties of French. At the time of the Revolution, most people did not speak what we would now consider standard French. A standardized French dialect was pushed through by the highly centralized French state.

Standard German only really developed in the 19th Century, and it's still basically a second language to a large fraction of ""German"" speakers, who speak mutually unintelligible dialects at home.

Then, there are lots of countries for which your statement isn't true at all. Belgium has two major languages. Switzerland has three.

For a tank after you locate the enemy the commander calls for HEAT, slews the turret onto the target, gunner acquires the target, shoot. Whole thing is done in seconds.

The tank would be cooking off one kilometer earlier from ATGM shot. This is not realistic, symmetric scenario that we're talking about. This is mopping Taliban in Afghanistan or something like this. And, I make no claims about tank performance in those situations. But who in real, trained military will go off with lone MG when seeing tank? 

For one of those situations, you'll get 10 smoldering husks in a random field that did not get a chance to fire. Like this. https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1524839423128522759

&gt; Whole thing takes at least a few minutes if the artillery is available.

Have you read the thread? Apparently they got down to 30 seconds.

&gt;And the whole “just move fast” thing is crap. Sometimes you can’t move fast and you just have to slug it out.

That's what I advocate for. Slow, methodical grind with artillery, drones, and if possible, air support.

&gt;What do you replace them with?

What did we replace battleships with? Something entirely different.

&gt;Tanks can take more of a hit than most things. No they are not invincible, but nothing is. 

One thing I'm missing is how much better western tanks are compared to T-90M and T-80BVM - maybe some can withstand Javelin hit? Besides, I think we can leave it at that.

Considering cops raid the wrong places on accident sometimes, but then mix in the fact it's a foreign country with people who speak diff. languages, among the myriad of other factors, you'd be wild to pretend that \*only\* the ""right"" kind of civilians were murdered

Basically: Anyone who doesn't believe civilians were killed in Iraq is either willfully ignorant or straight up retawded. Some even on purpose I'm sure, though that vast majority would be accidents but killed nonetheless.

It has nothing to do with being American or them not being ""the right kind of civilians"". It's a combination of human nature, fuzzy intel, the intensity of warfare, insanely unique situations etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.

CIWS systems do the exact same thing — it’s just that they have more time to work with so it makes more sense to fire rounds then account for the loss factor to walk them on target, whereas for APS you only get one shot, so you shoot it all at once.

My thought is the “shotgun effect” that is described by the press is dumbed down terminology meant for the masses.

Russia sacrificed survivability for cost effectiveness which is why their armour is being destroyed left right and center. The west sacrificed cost effectiveness for survivability. 

Russia can pump out tanks like no tomorrow but all their crews die with the tank meaning they aren't carrying crew experience into the next major battle/ war. And they end up eating the cost they spared in production by having to train new crews.

Western tanks have way better survivability meaning they save money having to train new crews and the more battles those crews fight in and win means they carry experience forward and also determinate that experience to new crews meaning that even brand new crews are going to be more experienced than Russian crews.

Russia sacrificed survivability for cost effectiveness which is why their armour is being destroyed left right and center. The west sacrificed cost effectiveness for survivability. 

Russia can pump out tanks like no tomorrow but all their crews die with the tank meaning they aren't carrying crew experience into the next major battle/ war. And they end up eating the cost they spared in production by having to train new crews.

Western tanks have way better survivability meaning they save money having to train new crews and the more battles those crews fight in and win means they carry experience forward and also determinate that experience to new crews meaning that even brand new crews are going to be more experienced than Russian crews.

Compare the failed use of tanks in the Russian invasion if Ukraine to the US's use of tanks in desert storm, and also the invasion of Iraq. Iraqi forces had ATGM's, ATM's artillery and air support and yet American tank losses were minimal and they achieved great effects in shaping the battlefield.

It wasn't a ""rant"" and nothing about what I said was ""hysterical"". It was a very straight-forward response to your delusional, brainwashed comments.

You are the one who is hysterically ranting after being triggered. Your comment is yet another projection.

&gt;Conflates actual fascism with socialism

That's literally what you did. I use the term fascism specifically to describe fascism. I use the term fascism in the academically correct and historically valid sense. 

You don't even know what fascism is, do you?

&gt; HURR DURR WEST BAD? Check.

Yes. The West is bad. Several reasons have been given.

&gt;Something something CIA? Check. 

Yes, the CIA is directly involved in Ukraine and has been for the past 70 years. Are you denying this?

&gt;Seething so hard about “tyranny and propaganda” that all subtlety and self awareness completely escapes your cloistered worldview?

What subtleties am I missing and what self-awareness do I lack?

&gt;That’s a bingo!!!

You have literally engaged in desperate blind dismissal of overwhelming arguments and evidence against you. That is stereotypical behaviour for apologists of fascist American society. 

I have given you a chance to apologize for the disinformation you believe. I have given you a chance to ask questions so you can learn and grow as a human being. I have spent a significant amount of time trying to engage with you constructively and given you the benefit of the doubt as a human being.

Instead of engaging reasonably, you not only double down on your rabid hatred and lies, you become ever more abusive and recede further into your bubble of ignorance, choosing to believe in a false reality based on nothing but Nazi-style atrocity propaganda lies about the ""others"", choosing to deny the failures of your society, the crimes of your nation, the depravity of your country and its backwards, inhuman culture.

Why are you even still responding? It's clear that you neither have the will nor the intellect and education necessary to have a constructive conversation.

Do you just seek to spread more hatred and harm others more? To add insult to the injury that your society inflicts on this world? Not only is it not enough for Americans to deny the failures of their capitalist ideology and white supremacist culture and refuse responsibility for the global harm caused by their fascist empire... they are too hateful and deluded to even recognize their own evil. Just like the citizens of Nazi Germany, there is no reasoning with such people. There is no peaceful solution possible with a fascist society that has broken its people to this degree. The only language you will ever understand is the language of violence.

, was a common model in use by mid-1944. It incorporated technological improvements over the preceding M1, introduced in winter 1942 and spring 1943, and the M1A1, introduced in the spring and summer of 1943. It consisted of several parts;

    Two long, cylindrical fuel tanks, mounted side by side, holding a total of four gallons of fuel. The M2-2, when compared to the M1, was capable of firing a normal fuel (such as gasoline or light fuel oil) or fuel mixed with a standardized thickener. The stream of un-thickened fuel as it left the gun was a wide spray. The stream of thickened fuel was much narrower, and could be ""bounced"" off walls, apertures, and such to get it into pillboxes, and had a habit of ""sticking"" to what it hit.

    A smaller, pressurized tank holding non-flammable nitrogen gas or air mounted on top of the two fuel tanks. The M2-2 improved the connection methods and quickened the changing procedure of the three tanks over the M1 and M1A1, limiting leakage.

    A valve, which was opened to release the gas stored in the pressurized tank. On the M1 and M1A1 flamethrowers, the valve needed to be opened by the flamethrower operator's assistant, while on the M2-2, the operator could do it himself as it was made to be within his reach. The valve made a loud hissing sound as it released nitrogen or air, and it was advised to not open it until within shooting range of the enemy, if possible.

    A hose, which connected the pressurized tank to the fuel tanks and allowed the pressurized nitrogen or air to enter them when the operator was ready to fire.

    Another hose, which connected the three tanks to a gun assembly held by the operator

    A gun assembly, which, when its trigger was pulled, allowed the pressurized fuel-air mixture to exit, ignited it, and directed it towards the target. The gun contained five small incendiary charges in its muzzle which were ignited and burned vigorously for a time when the trigger was pulled; the heat of the charge ignited the pressurized fuel-air mixture as it passed it. There were five charges carried in the muzzle of the gun; when they ran out, they needed to be replaced before the flamethrower could fire again.

The entire assembly of tanks, hoses, and valves was mounted to a padded packboard-like structure with shoulder straps and a belt which allowed the flamethrower to be carried on the operator's back. The M2-2 was capable of firing bursts of flame that lasted for a total of eight to nine seconds before the pressurized tank ran out of nitrogen or air and needed to be recharged. The M2-2, in comparison to the M1 and M1A1, had an increased range (twenty to forty yards, versus fifteen yards). As noted above, the new M2-2 fixed many issued that plagued the M1 and M1A1, but it still had issues of its own. if the filled pressurized tanks were left in direct sunlight, the pressure could increase and the safety discs would blow out. Heat was generated when the pressurized tank was filled, and purposefully cooling it could lead to a marked decrease (200 psi) in the pressure of the contents. Stocks of the M2-2 were also not sufficient to replace the M1 and M1A1 completely by the end of the war.

The flamethrower operator was not usually in any real danger if his weapon was hit. The fuel-air mixture did not have a surefire method of ignition unless the trigger was pulled and the mixture reached the ignition charge at the muzzle of the gun. Nitrogen and air are basically not flammable when hit by normal bullets. If the tank was hit, the filling would just hiss out harmlessly. The only danger the operator would face if his pressurized tank was compromised would be if it somehow burst like when an aerosol can is heated or punctured; he could be hit and injured or even killed by pieces of shrapnel from the exploding tank. If the fuel cylinders were hit by a normal bullet, the mixture would just harmlessly leak out; incendiary bullets posed a bit more danger. In either case, the weapon would be disabled, and would need to be returned to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) for refurbishment or scrapping if damaged badly enough.

Flamethrower operators often faced a unique danger in that they proved a tempting target, and were often specially tagged for quick elimination by the enemy, who feared a fiery death. The flamethrower had a very short range when compared to small-arms fire, and this necessitated that the operator get uncomfortably close to the enemy in order to eliminate him.

Flamethrowers first saw wide use in the Pacific Theater. In December 1942, small numbers of the experimental E1 and E1R1 flamethrowers were used in the southwest Pacific area, on New Guinea. The experimental models performed poorly, and improved models were not used again in the area until December 1943, on New Britain and the Admiralty Islands. The flamethrower proved itself, and was used often in campaigns until the end of the war.

The flamethrower was initially more effective and used more widely by troops in the central Pacific area. In October 1943, 12 flamethrowers were allocated to each Army infantry regiment (36 total for the division). This was soon after increased to 60, but this temporarily disrupted the supply and it took a while to achieve this level. After lessons learned in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign of late 1943 and early 1944, 192 flamethrowers were authorized per division. As this was realized by the Army to be too many for one division to effectively use, the allotment was reduced to 141 before the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign of summer 1944. The E-series table of organization and equipment for a Marine division used from April 1943 to May 1944 only had 24 flamethrowers. For the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, this allotment was temporarily increased to 72, and then to 81. The F-series TO&amp;E, implemented in May 1944, fixed that problem permanently, with 243 man-portable flamethrowers allotted to the division, along with 24 E4-5 flamethrowers designed to be mounted in the bow machine gun sockets of the division's organic medium tanks! The G-series TO&amp;E introduced in early 1945 reduced the number of man-portable flamethrowers to 108.

In comparison to the Pacific, flamethrower use was uncommon in the European and Mediterranean theaters. Flamethrowers were brought ashore in North Africa in 1942, but they were not used. They were used once on Sicily, where the 1st Infantry Division used a flamethrower to burn a field where German soldiers were hiding. The 85th Infantry Division used flamethrowers when attacking German positions around the Gustav Line in May 1944. Out of 150 flamethrowers issued by the CWS for D-Day, many were simply dumped due to their extreme weight, and about 100 were collected after the beach landing; there is not one recorded instance of them being used in action on June 6. For normal campaigning in Europe, the Army recommended that each division have 24 flamethrowers.

The flamethrower proved less effective in the ETO and MTO due to the use of open stone or brick buildings as fortifications most of the time instead of flammable wooden buildings or confined caves (which exploited the flamethrower's ability to asphyxiate enemies when the flames consumed all the oxygen in an area), and the tendency of the German, when compared to the Japanese, to surrender when outmatched or cornered instead of fighting to the death. The U.S. V Corps considered the flamethrower ineffective in the hedgerow country of the Normandy campaign. It was used successfully at Brest on a couple (the 8th Infantry Division used them three times, the 2nd twice, and the 29th at least once) occasions;

    On one occasion the 1st Battalion, 121st Infantry, 8th Division, was held up...by a series of three concrete positions....Although artillery had failed to reduce the strongpoint, it had left many large shell holes in the vicinity. Using the cover afforded...two flame thrower operators, covered by the small arms fire of ten men, were able to crawl within thirty yards of the fortifications. A short burst of flame...resulted in the hasty surrender of the occupants.

Flamethrower use was relatively sparse for the rest of the campaigns. The 1st, 4th, 9th, 30th, and 100th Infantry Divisions used them in a very limited fashion during their assaults on the Siegfried and Maginot Lines during the fall of 1944 and winter of 1945. Out of the 8 infantry divisions assigned to the U.S. Seventh Army in February 1945, 2 divisions had no flamethrowers, 1 division had 4, 3 divisions had 6, and 2 other divisions had totals of 12 and 34. Unlike in the Pacific, flamethrowers were not readily provided to infantry divisions, and division chemical officers had to purposefully seek them out, consulting engineer combat battalions (who were more likely to get them) or going to the CWS directly. A persistent problem was training; many units lacked the time or motivation to train flamethrower operators. In the U.S. Seventh Army, 80 percent of received flamethrowers were unusable in October 1944 because of a lack of batteries and ignition assemblies!

I love playing strategy games.

Making the loop - in strategy games you can often build something, and aside all it's active perks, it also provides a passive strategic benefit that your enemy cannot easily use whatever you're strong against.

To bring it back to your example:

If you know your enemy does not have any tanks (keep it simple), you have the option to employ strategies that wouldn't be possible with tanks present.

So just by having i.e. tanks, you already deny a lot of the enemies' options.

I'm curious, is there anything in military theory (or the like) touching upon such topics?",a566304e466f408548b4503c4c7d59a48ebab645,True,False,,,,,0,1652385545,,0,{},i8d0cdy,False,t3_unv4pz,False,True,t1_i8aq0hw,/r/CombatFootage/comments/unv4pz/tank_general_post/i8d0cdy/,1652385564,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652356745.0,

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called Germany a leader in Ukraine support in Europe. ""Germany has taken the lead,"" Kuleba said on ARD television Thursday. He said he sees a change in attitude toward arms deliveries and in the sanctions debate. ""Germany is playing first fiddle in Europe."" Kuleba downplayed previous disagreements between Kiev and Berlin. But he said he would continue to say in the future if something did not suit him. For example, Kuleba criticized the equation in banning Ukrainian and Russian flags at memorials in Berlin commemorating the end of World War II. He said that it was Russia that was attacking open values.[1](https://liveblog.faz.net/Event/Ukraine-Konflikt/1211242363)",64fe54e74919849a8ca5264cc50e464212a384c4,True,False,,,,,0,1652385157,,0,{},i8czbzg,False,t3_uo8w0w,False,True,t1_i8cwzyb,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uo8w0w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51322/i8czbzg/,1652385174,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652356357.0,

There are a lot of ethnic minorities in Russia, and the vast, vast majority of the ethnically Russian population is concentrated in the western portions of the country.

Now consider declining birthrates in Russia (which are likely artificially inflated by the government btw) and the fact that Russia's poorer minorities are growing much faster than ethnic Russians.

The demographics will look drastically different in 100 years. So unless Russia somehow becomes a liberal democracy that can represent and bind together its various ethnic groups, then I don't think the modern Russian state can continue to exist in its present form.

TL;DR:

1. Tell it what kind of thing you want to disassemble.
2. Aim at target and fire.
3. Make tea while the missile figure it out.

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.army-technology.com/projects/brimstone/

&gt; Brimstone is equipped with a small, robust millimetric wave radar seeker operating at 94GHz, providing the capability to operate in all weather conditions, day and night. The seeker operates in low visibility and contaminated battlefield conditions and is not susceptible to battlefield obscurants such as smoke, dust, flares and chaff.
&gt; 
&gt; The high-millimetric band seeker provides a high-resolution radar return image of the target, while the frequency gives a small beamwidth and therefore, very high angular resolution and reduces unwanted clutter for the given antenna size, which is limited by the diameter of the missile.
&gt; 
&gt; The millimetre wave radar enables wideband operation, facilitating the use of very sophisticated electronic countermeasures. Millimetric radar attenuates more rapidly than conventional centimetric radar in rain, sleet and fog, but its advantage is high penetration, in comparison to infrared sensor systems when countermeasures are employed.
&gt; 
&gt; Brimstone’s seeker incorporates a terrain avoidance capability, allowing it to cruise at a fixed height above ground.
&gt; 
&gt; A digital autopilot provides mid-course guidance and uses a high-accuracy digital inertial measurement system for high-precision navigation to locate targets at long range and in off-boresight operations.
&gt; 
&gt; The highly advanced guidance system on the launcher’s fire control unit and missile uses the target coordinates, course, speed, distance to target, missile trajectory data and data from other sensors to direct the controls and produce the optimum flight path to the target.

...

&gt; Embedded algorithms can be told to attack only valid targets within a specified area. The high selectivity allows Brimstone to target armoured vehicles and ignore other fixed or moving assets, such as houses or cars. It is also possible to programme the missile to engage targets with a specific radar signature, for example, patrol boats.
&gt; 
&gt; The missile is fitted with a programmable self-destruct mechanism.",3f3a09413cc570d38b62eea66f938c43e7ee4bcf,True,False,,,,,0,1652381629,,0,{},i8cq5pj,False,t3_um5z6p,False,True,t1_i8cdzo8,/r/CombatFootage/comments/um5z6p/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51022/i8cq5pj/,1652381645,1,False,False,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652352829.0,

It lets small countries like Finland have pretty much guaranteed air superiority over Russia with 60 odd F35s on order. 

There are also swarms in development where up to 6 small semi disposable stealth drones like xq58s can fly with a single F35 as wingmen. Carrying extra weapons and jammers, and acting as decoys. 

You get the mass and inexpensive advantages of drones with the expensive sensors and human pilot quarterbacking. 

But it takes a year or more to train pilots and only close US allies can buy them. You can't ship F35s to Ukraine easily. And the US can 'turn them off' if you turn against them. 

You also have to buy them in US dollars.

For the sake of argument I'm going to leave out the resource sink/efficiency angle because there's just not much to debate. 

Size/Weight: Something this large requires insane amounts of power/fuel to move. Not only would your speed be time-lapse levels of slow(NASA crawler comes to mind), your extreme weight would severely limit where you could safely travel. You're only going to get stuck once. 

Tracks: Tracks(like all parts) need to be serviceable, so having them underneath would be an issue. Side-placement also helps them self-clean dirt/debris. My crackpot solution would be to include internal gaps to service them but I'm pretty sure that could seriously fuck with the overall integrity as AFAIK nobody in history has done this. 

Armor: Even if you somehow achieve the(impossible) goal of making the vehicle itself impervious to heavy artillery/bombing; which would be necessary given the speed and size make it a sitting duck; you can't do the same for infrastructure or surrounding areas.

Israel never used WP based weapons, they were using WP based smoke rounds, used by literally by every major army in the war (including Russia in this one, but it was never mentioned because no one ever had a problem with smoke screen unless Israel is involved).

It's harmless unless you stay for **minutes** in a small closed room with the smoke, and even then it just causes coughing and headache.

So many comments along the lines of ""omg no this is the Essen!"". People should give it a rest.

Its Makarov. She, along with Grigorovich (in the Mediterannean), have retained the grey radome for its Pozitiv-M radar. 

While Essen has her Pozitiv-M radome replaced between May and July 2021.

If you join the two Iraq ears together it's even higher. Since you have to account for the fact that the U.S. deliberately destroyed Iraq's water treatment facilities and placed sanctions that prevented them from sourcing new equipment. The untold numbers who died from lack of clean drinking water would certainly inflate the number. 

Then you have to add in how hundreds of thousands of people who aren't even born yet, will die young and in pain, because we irradiated whole fucking communities with DU rounds.

The missiles are launched into a 'target box' where they hunt for targets using the radar seeker, they're programmed to go for high value targets like tanks, artillery and SAM's first then other targets in order of priority. When salvo launched the missiles use a complex algorithm to target high priority targets in sequence (so all missiles don't aim for 1 target). The idea was that Brimstone would arm UK fast jets that would not have to overfly Russian tank columns and use Cluster Bombs, instead they could fire a whole salvo of Brmstone and kill 12 targets without having to get close to air defences. Its since evolved beyond that into a low collateral weapon that you can carry lots of. It's been used in combat since 2011 in Libya (where 1 Tornado fired a full salvo of 12 Brimstone at a Ghaddaffi armoured column wiping it out) but has more recently been used in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria from Typhoons. It's used when a target is moving or when a laser guided bomb would cause too much damage. Salvo fire looks like below (from Tornado and a platform at sea).

&amp;#x200B;

As of May 12, 2022, Ukrainian forces have confirmed to have destroyed, damaged/disabled, abandoned, and captured 664 total SHITs. This massive amount of combat ineffective SHITs combines for an approximate gross weight in excess of 27,000 tons. The fate of each SHIT is detailed below following the final paragraph. However, the accuracy of this SHIT list will never be 100% solid, as the number of total SHITs wiped out varies each day as a result of Russian movements and the pressure exerted on them by the enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

An accurate number of SHITs can only be ascertained once the last SHIT succumbs, sometime during the final hours of hostilities. Unfortunately, even once the war has reached its end, the noxious gases and liquids accompanying thousands of SHITs will ultimately leave a lasting stain on the once fertile environment for many years to come. The environmental cleaning personnel will be hard at work to sanitize the subsequent damage left behind from the largest accumulation of wrecked SHIT since WWII.

&amp;#x200B;

The SHIT damage will be evident throughout the country, and there will undoubtedly be many newly discovered SHIT-related toxins found throughout Ukraine for years to come.

Took you two hours to find one, eh?

Also, if you think *that* is propaganda from the US military, you need to see what the real stuff looks like

&gt; Now recite the following words:

u/FollowLeiFeng is an obvious troll simping for the Chinese Communist Party, and the only reason he's pestering me about an obvious observation I made a month ago is because he's being paid to do so.

&gt; You simply don't read such comments when it's western militaries doing their thing.

How would you know what I read and don't?  This isn't China: I don't have government censors restricting access to what I can and can't view on the internet.

&gt; Hilarious how you think people talking about the thing that should matter the most in all global public discourse - the fight against Western imperialism/capitalism

It's hilarious that you think *that* is the most important thing to be talking about.  Not the invasion of a country the invaders claim doesn't have a right to exist, not the millions of refugees that war is creating, not the millions of Chinese citizens being thrown into *Chinese* concentration camps where the CCP is committing genocide about them, not the fact that China is reneging on its agreement with Hong Kong that their local government would be left alone and that reintegration with the mainland would happen naturally, not the fact that China is openly discussing the possibility of invading Taiwan...

...""all that matters"" is the fight against some nebulous concept of the fight against capitalism--as if China hasn't embraced capitalist authoritarianism whole hog, itself.

If you *really* cared about what unchecked capitalism looks like, you'd be attacking pro-*RUSSIAN* comments and staging protests in your own fucking country.  Let me know when you start: I'll be right there with you.

&gt; I could be Putin himself and my points would still be [blatant lies in service of authoritarianism].

FTFY.

&gt; Not hiding what?

The fact that you're an obvious troll working in service of the CCP.  I know English isn't your first language, but you clearly know enough of it to be able to keep up in this conversation.  Try, maybe?

&gt; Socialism is good, no shame in supporting socialism or China

China isn't socialist, though.  Your economy is capitalist and your government is somewhere between fascist and totalitarianist.  The CCP just pretends to be communist because it's good propaganda to keep the serf in line.  Serfs like you.

&gt; Unlike people supporting capitalism or the US and its conspiracies

Do yourself a favor and look at my comment history before you try to pin that bullshit on me.

&gt; there's nothing I need to be ashamed of

*[laughs]* Thanks for that.  Everyone needs comedy in their life.

&gt; damn right I support human liberation from systematic oppression by inhuman tyrants seeking to exploit them

*[falls over laughing]*

You support the Chinese government, numbnuts.  Think about it: 
 Do you think there's *anywhere* else in the world where you have to build up and maintain enough ""social credit"" to obtain basic goods and services?

You know what's worse?  Think of all the state-run factories you have in China, how they're all manufacturing goods for Western companies who are only doing business there because the labor is so cheap.  Your own government is selling you out to the westerners you claim to fight against, all for a quick buck for themselves.

&gt; Well, clearly you do

I'm responding to the comments you're sending.  That's one guy, maybe two.  How many people saw the parent post?  At least 1700, because that's how many likes it got.  See how you're wasting your time, yet?

&gt; The only paid shills on Western social media are those working for the US government ([exemplia gratia] your friends over at Fort Eglin)

Oh, you're way wrong on this one.  For starters, it's *Eglin Air Force Base*, and it'd be more likely to see PSYOPS coming out of Ft. Huachuca or Ft. Monroe.

More importantly, the paid shills of US social media are mostly *corporate* interests: companies who want to keep a good image so people keep buying their useless shit.  

I realize your confusion, of course: a key feature of totalitarianism and fascism is the blending of corporate and government interests, and literally every corporation in China is a state-run entity, so it'd be *natural* for you to assume that whoever runs a Wendy's ad campaign is a government agent.  

That, and...well...*you* do it, so you've got to believe your situation is true for everyone, right?

&gt; what the fuck is ""Chinese propaganda?""

Guided messaging, with and without the use of government-sponsored lies, promoting the interests of the Chinese government.

&gt; You mean factual reality?

Tell me about Xinjiang, then, because the bullshit the CCP is pumping out about it doesn't match what the people on the ground are saying.  Ditto that for anything about Hong Kong or Tibet, and don't even get me started on the lie that Taiwan isn't its own country.

&gt; I talk to reactionary individuals (usually Americans)

Then why are you pestering *me?*

&gt; It's up to you whether you take that to heart

You know how nobody pays attention to the greeters at a Walmart?  It's because even if the shit that comes out of their mouths is sincere, everyone knows they're being paid to say it.

Cue you, CCP troll, telling me ""your opinions.""  *Think anyone will take what you say to heart?*",b1d675662ffc4a6ac96bdecd1453f06687b3a642,True,False,,,,,0,1652372240,,0,{},i8c2i4p,False,t3_u2kz2w,False,True,t1_i8bghc7,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u2kz2w/ka52_pov_destroying_buk_after_launch/i8c2i4p/,1652372253,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652343440.0,

But now it has been months, do people really still don't understand what this subreddit is about? It even feels there is a group of people that does this constantly and on purpose, maybe they leak form subreddits like r/Ukraine.

Active protection systems that could defend against these new threats are one direction that I'm sure will get a lot more R&amp;D, but I'm not sure that they'll be able to keep up with the proliferation of ATGMs and drones that we're likely to see. I'd guess that we're going to eventually see things like drone swarms that would pretty reliably overwhelm active protection systems. 

Maybe things will swing the other way, where it's basically concluded that it's not going to be effectively possible to build a tank that's armored well enough to defeat these kinds of attack, so instead they become focused more on reducing their armor, reducing their size, reducing their cost, and increasing their speed. Still something heavy enough to protect its operators from small arms and machine guns, but just accepting that they'll be susceptible to ATGMs and the like. They'll become more of a 'glass cannon' type weapon where you know you're going to lose some of them, but the hope would be that they're cheap and fast enough that you can have a lot of them and still manage to bring enough mobile firepower to the fight even if some of them are getting destroyed along the way.",2f17707279391923d0d1861cf9f01e09eebeb10a,True,False,,,,,0,1652369627,,0,{},i8bvsny,False,t3_unv4pz,False,True,t1_i8b2d8t,/r/CombatFootage/comments/unv4pz/tank_general_post/i8bvsny/,1652369647,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652340827.0,

For that reason, we might not see much footage, it makes no sense to have two drones over the same spot, waste of recourses. Maybe they're not allowed to film the actual targeting module, so maybe we will never see footage from the operator screen.

Another possible reason is, altough the drones have a decent range, they're not designed to be used as some kind of guided artillery from max range. They're designed to be carried close to an enemy location, use it for recon of the area, and then take out a target if there is one. In those stealthy kinda ops, I doubt they will bring a cellphone.

If something exceeds terminal velocity on its way up but falls ballistically, it'll take longer to fall than it took to go up.

[Here is US combat footage on this subreddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sra9i5cWYHc).

Now recite the following words: ""I am a bad faith US apologist who didn't like his latently russophobic comments being contradicted and who can't get over the fact that everything his country represents is inhuman garbage. I am responsible for making this world worse.""

&gt;First, not bullshit. 

Of course it's bullshit. You simply don't read such comments when it's Western militaries doing their thing.

&gt;Second, one needs only look at your profile to see what you are. Only been active for 2.5 months, every post a pro-China proclamation, every comment either pro-China or attacking anything the CCP would take issue with.

Hilarious how you think people talking about the thing that should matter the most in all global public discourse - the fight against Western imperialism/capitalism - instead of wasting their time on other meaningless garbage, means your ridiculous conspiracy theory about people contradicting you being ""trolls"" is proven. It's also funny that you believe that someone being a ""troll"" means they are somehow wrong or you are somehow right.

I could be Putin himself and my points would still be as valid as anyone else's.

Also: Due to the systematic censorship of anti-American/pro-socialist views on all of mainstream Western social media, people like me need to constantly make new accounts. Nice try trying to use the consequences of censorship against its victims, though. Who taught you that? LMFAO

&gt;See? You’re not even hiding it.

Not hiding what? I have nothing to hide. Socialism is good, China is good, no shame in supporting socialism or China. Unlike people supporting capitalism or the US and its conspiracies, there's nothing I need to be ashamed of. Yeah, damn right I support human liberation from systematic oppression by inhuman tyrants seeking to exploit them.

&gt;You should. Generally speaking, nobody pays attention to posts over a week old.

Well, clearly you do. lol

&gt;If—purely hypothetically speaking—you were being paid by the CCP to push Chinese propaganda, you’d want to make sure a large group of people would see it.

The only paid shills on Western social media are those working for the US government (e.g. your friends over at Fort Eglin).

Meanwhile, what the fuck is ""Chinese propaganda""? You mean factual reality?

I talk to reactionary individuals (usually Americans) to point out their destructive behaviour and backwards ideas. It's up to you whether you take that to heart, be reasonable, and become a better person.",49d92291e21827c89f5c6b42fad9f4132253c21a,True,True,,,,,0,1652363503,,0,{},i8bghc7,False,t3_u2kz2w,False,True,t1_i8b1q3j,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u2kz2w/ka52_pov_destroying_buk_after_launch/i8bghc7/,1652363515,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652334703.0,

We've got crisp drone footage followed by an extremely low quality blurry video which you cant even tell whats going on except for the greenish tarp. Are these even the same vehicles?The colour is drastically different between the video and as another commenter pointed out the foliage/trees dont look the same. The cutting and editing is also weird, as if they have a drone up why not show that angle of the hit? There's also no post attack footage.   


Then you've got a crisp video of a Javelin being fired from the weirdest position possible, with the camera perfectly set up. Compare this to the other real javelin firing videos that have been posted here and its simply too convenient/set-up. None of the actual rush, urgency, or trying to keep their heads down as in other combat footage. If it was live combat wouldn't they be focusing on taking it out before it possible moves or spots them, rather than getting video angles? Are we looking at them filming a propaganda video of them taking out an abandoned Russian tank/IFV? Theres been many of those.   


Also the video cuts off before we can see the damage. You've got some white smoke coming out but if you compare 0:35 to 0:49 (just before it cuts off to replay the explosion) the smoke has massively died down. Is that just smoke from the engine running, using smoke screen or is the tank burning?

If you can name another vehicle that can advance with the troops and survive against heavy MGs and artillery and deliver fast, cheap and powerful firepower without relying on external targeting and can move over most terrain, I’m all ears. 

A Stryker can’t do that because it doesn’t have the mobility, firepower or armour. An spg can’t do that because it doesn’t have the targeting ability, ability to shoot on the move or the ability to rapidly switch targets, an ATGM team can’t do that because they can only carry a few shots and each one is worth 10’s of thousands of dollars. An ATGM on a vehicle can’t do that because it can’t advance into contact with troops. An ATGM on a tank-chassis still has the same issues of limited and costly ammunition plus their rockets are too slow for many situations. Aircraft can’t do that because they aren’t persistent. Infantry cant do it for all sorts of reasons.

&gt; Is there destroyer design that can drive up the beach and continue fighting on land? Why not? Surely it is something that can be build and has a set of abilities that no other vehicle has? We don't have a ship like that because the costs would not outweigh the (niche) benefits.

no, no countries have that kind of ships because it's impossible design ships like that. ridiculous example aside, direct fire support for troops on the ground is important and it's worth it to have a weapon system that can do that considering you won the war by foot on the ground. 

&gt;It's all about cost effectiveness and that is what is being questioned of tanks: Does the added protection still outweigh the extra cost and weight due to increased armour?

This breeds situations where your best troops are consistently put on jobs they’re good at because they can get it done, but this starts a snowball of good at your job so you get more work. The slackers aren’t relied upon so they aren’t worked as hard. The fuckups are promoted to desk jobs like working the tool room or doing admin duty. We are losing amazing people constantly because they just can’t handle it anymore. That gets us to where we are and we have folks learning on the job and trying to figure it out, while some dude who knows the jet inside and out got out because they can make more on the outside with significantly less stress. Deployed we work 12 hours but back home it’s an average of 10. Meanwhile the dude handing out basketballs at the gym is still an E-4 making the same money you do so we also lose those that like the military but hate maintenance to cross training. As far as the pilots here it’s just a mandated amount of crew rest so they can fly 2 days consecutively but it would be early morning one day and late night the next day.

So we see a lot of these videos and wonder what they are doing with RPGs in situations where no one seems to be shooting back. In urban combat like this where you fight street by street, a lot of times you will set up in a position you may have to stay at for a while. Someone looks up at a building across the street and says ""this position is fine, but that one house has a window that would give someone a clear shot at all of us.""

You don't want to just leave it, and sending a couple guys across the street is just a risk. So you fire an RPG from a relatively safe distance/spot. Now if someone wants to shoot you from that window they have to do it without cover, because there's a giant hole. As to why we see it so often...well if I was about to fire an RPG in relative safety, I would certainly hand my phone to a buddy and ask them to record it.

Their T72 tank design means that tanks are lower profile by a foot, smaller overall, need less manpower to run(3 vs western 4). Their smaller tanks are also lighter and get better gas mileage compared to Abrams. In typical Russian fashion they are a rugged basic thing that costs 1/10th the american equivalent Abrams cost.

Have two carbon fibre brackets holding nacelles out in a V shape up and away from the body about 10"". Use wireframe carbon fibre to shape them like fat cigars to hold a large volume of lifting glasses in a very aerodynamic manner. So from the top view it would look something like a tall H. Then you can use most of the energy to propel the vehicle rather than lift, but not run into excessive speed issues with a fat profile. Flight endurance would be excellent with the right balance of factors. Then a matter of figuring out how to integrate Starlink into it as ideally a basic single-PCB design coexisting with the servo controller, battery management, camera/optics, etc. 

Idk. Seems like a fun field to try new things in.

The loiter time, operating altitude, payload and on board electronics are very different. I've seen some claims about the Bayraktar having electronic counter measures on board, but I don't know how accurate that is. Still, they tend to fly at a greater height.

Normal MANPADS don't seem to be very useful against the smaller commercial drones, probably because of their small signature, but there have been reports of larger drones that were taken out by missiles.

I am very curious to see if the deployment of previously considered obsolete mobile AA platforms like the Gepard will have any impact on the use of larger drones.

For whatever it's worth, the BBC's main security correspondent just published these thoughts:



&gt; So how will he respond?

&gt;Military moves. For now, President Putin has his hands full in Ukraine so he is unlikely to make any sudden moves in Finland’s direction. Russian troops close to the 800 mile (1300km) joint border have been redeployed south. In time though, he is likely to move both troops and missiles nearer to Finland’s border and mount aggressive air and naval patrols.


&gt;Hybrid warfare. Cyber attacks and cyber espionage have been going on for some time, aimed at most European states. These can now be expected to be directed specifically at Finland and Sweden if they join Nato, accompanied by the usual official denials of culpability.


&gt;Subversion. Putin likes to play a long game and he may well decide that these two Nordic countries’ historic neutrality means any decision to join Nato can be reversed. In time, he may opt to try to shape Finnish public opinion against Nato with the help of online bots and fake accounts.",876432138310fa2bcd7b3fbad8fb2022b9bedce9,True,False,,,,,0,1652350047,,0,{},i8asvjg,False,t3_um5z6p,False,True,t1_i8aow7r,/r/CombatFootage/comments/um5z6p/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51022/i8asvjg/,1652350063,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652321247.0,

In reality only the first one really matters. More specifically ""is there something important that only a tank can do?"". If the answer is yes, then you build and operate your forces in such a way that it enables those capabilities while protecting against their weaknesses.

What can tanks do? They bring heavy, fast, direct fire to the front line, they can detect, target and kill everything from bunkers to infantry and any vehicle on the battlefield up to and including a tank. They can do that in any weather persistently without relying on external communications and they can move over most terrain relatively easily. They package all that into a platform that is relatively survivable on the battlefield, even under indirect fire and fire from heavy MG's, even without cover.

There's no other vehicle that can do all that. Yes you can do parts of most of that with other systems except for the heavy direct fire part. Artillery is great, laser guided artillery is great, but it's not always available, accurate or able to be contacted if your comms go down. Man portable ATGMs are great against tanks etc but they are slow to deploy and relatively slow in flight and can be defeated with good protection systems. They are also lousy for bunker busting since they are expensive and heavy. AFVs are good but they don't carry enough armour to survive out in the open where they need to be if they are going to carry the attack forward.

Tanks aren't going anywhere anytime soon. If the vulnerability argument was valid then infantry would have been phased out decades ago.",5622e61dd57d8645c2205c0479d6eefc7aafc655,True,False,,,,,0,1652347620,,0,{},i8aq0hw,False,t3_unv4pz,False,True,t1_i8anu6b,/r/CombatFootage/comments/unv4pz/tank_general_post/i8aq0hw/,1652347636,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652318820.0,

While very effective, shoulder fired anti-tank muntions have the natural disadvantage of user restrictions/error. A shot at the front hull will not yield the same damage in respect to other areas on the tank. This varies from tank to tank. There are considerably more armored and larger MBTs that would fare better than what's being fielded by the Russians currently. M1 Abrams and Isreali Merkava come to mind. But again this depends on the capabilities of the shooter and the understading of how, where and when to shoot.  

In contrast tanks are also generally very easy to disabled(not destroy). A very well placed yet simple heat rpg to the tracks could easily disable it, so could damage to the main gun, optical sensors, engine block, or even the ammo rack. There are some many other possibilities. 

So on short it's not necessarily that NLAWs make the tanks obsolete, but a mixture of bad tank doctrine and unsupported advances, and really bad logistics have made it a absolutely more effective within the Ukraine war. However, I do have to admit that it's also a fair argument that the role of tanks within any future asymmetric modern battlefield has lost a lot of its effective fighting capability due to these weapons systems.",7d8b9d1e568fcb1a3b2b750af07620686bb539ad,True,False,,,,,0,1652341839,,0,{},i8ajhuu,False,t3_unv4pz,False,True,t1_i8ahg4x,/r/CombatFootage/comments/unv4pz/tank_general_post/i8ajhuu/,1652341856,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652313039.0,

It should have, actually, because identifying targets is the job of the gunship, and if you are not sure if shooting something might constitute a war crime then a good rule of thumb is usually *don't fucking shoot at it.*

* Ukrainian forces are continuing to counter-attack to the north of Kharkiv, recapturing several towns and villages towards the Russian border. Russia’s prioritisation of operations in the Donbas has left elements deployed in the Kharkiv Oblast vulnerable to the mobile, and highly motivated, Ukrainian counter-attacking force.

* Despite Russia’s success in encircling Kharkiv in the initial stages of the conflict, it has reportedly withdrawn units from the region to reorganise and replenish its forces following heavy losses. Once reconstituted, these forces will likely deploy to the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, forming a blocking force to protect the western flank of Russia’s main force concentration and main supply routes for operations in the vicinity of Izium.

* The withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kharkiv Oblast is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population.",10ac3f04a095fa72fa5df18fde66b6870456a0d7,True,False,,,,,0,1652338003,,0,{},i8aeshf,False,t3_um5z6p,False,True,t3_um5z6p,/r/CombatFootage/comments/um5z6p/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51022/i8aeshf/,1652338017,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652309203.0,

Although I agree with the points you raised on their own - we should never trust something at face value if there are multiple cuts. And what you don't see can sometimes be quite important. In this case though, it's easy to deduce what happened with a really high chance of happening.

But the jump to partisan warfare is too much, we have 0 indications of possible partisan warfare or insurgency here (it's early in the war as well).

And the jump to whataboutism is too much as well. Yes, shit happens in every war. Why did you conveniently choose Israel and US for examples? You could have taken every war that happened and find bad shit.

What's funny to me, and why I do like these recordings is there's been an argument for a while that Russians don't touch civilians, they take special care of them, help them, etc. And no way they could be doing things like this.

Let me go file my FOIA request for ""videos of civilian killings"". The government will be sure to grab their labeled file of such acts and send me the contents ASAP.

This video was leaked, not released through FOIA. To do that, you'd have to know it existed first. This was not released because of the goodwill of the govt, it wasn't even handed over begrudgingly to a concerned citizen or journalist. It was smuggled out and released by force.

""The US, unlike the Russians, records and holds this information"". Ok, great, thanks are in order I guess? I don't think they're bothering with the hard drive space so that me and my pals can give them a ring and see how warcrimey the war is this month. They hold the information in order to use it. They will improve tactics and targeting. They want to make the same war but better. If you feel the way I do about this country, those videos are not a comforting presence.

How many videos like this are there? We don't know. We're not going to know. I don't understand the implication that there's some sort of transparency or accountability here. This sort of evidence, whatever else there is of it, is hidden behind layers of obscurity. How would you know to ask for it? And there are certainly things FOIA can't get at, and things congress can't touch. Do you think you can FOIA the latest CIA operation? The CIA has told the House Intelligence Committee to get lost, on some of the occasions the committee actually demonstrated an interest in finding out what this country gets up to. Regular people are certainly not going to see it.

I can appreciate some subtlety and nuance, I can appreciate your attempt at that style of argument, but I can't agree that there's something notably good or transparent or accessible about the way things are done here. Just because we get a little morsel once in a while doesn't mean the prevailing mode isn't secrecy, evasion, lying.

With the help of the local french their injuries were addressed and they were hidden for 6 days before returning to US control.

[Here's a few pages from the Missing Air Crew Report](https://imgur.com/a/venRnDt).  The first two are descriptions of the plane going down from people in other aircraft and the third is a page filled out by Moscovis saying he stayed behind enemy lines for 6 days after being shot down.

I don't see any reason to think so. First of all, BTGs by definition are widely different in size and composition, both by design and by necessity. Second, wtf is this 10+40 configuration means? A tank company with less then three infantry companies without any support, artillery, maintenance, AA, logistical or engineering vehicles? Well, that's simply not true. It could be true occasionally, due to losses or specific  circumstances.   


BTG should be somewhat autonomous - that is their distinction from a simple battalion. They should have their own elements to deal with expected challenges. Artillery, AT, AA, recon, maintenance, medics, supply - at the bare minimum, but still. So, a BTG, that is based around 1 tank and 3 infantry companies could actually have anywhere from 60 to 100 vehicles.   


And we can see exactly this at the crossing. Quite a few of the vehicles are not tanks or BMP/BTRs. But also there are little to no ""soft"" targets. How many tanks can we see - 7-8? How many engineering or support elements?  


So, what does it tell us? I agree, in terms of armored vehicles visible loses are close to BTG worth. But that doesn't mean, that everyone is dead. We probably see something like 1 tank company, 3 infantry company, 1 company of engineers, some reinforcing elements: recon, AT, mortar squad? All-in-all about 500 ration strength. And it does not look obliterated (except for the tank grave at the very crossing). More like, they got stuck under fire and bailed. So, while this is indeed a core elements of a BTG or more shattered, i see no reason to assume more, than, say 150-200 casualties (all kinds) from the crossing pics alone.",6f21774b087a2db9ce275ef0421944bd764c8048,True,False,,,,,0,1652325200,,0,{},i89uevw,False,t3_unm4c9,False,True,t1_i89blma,/r/CombatFootage/comments/unm4c9/heres_a_twitter_thread_allegedly_from_a_ua_combat/i89uevw/,1652325217,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652296400.0,

From the crisp, nicely focused and very detailed drone footage, we see the tarp mostly behind the turret. The terrain in front of the BMP is bare of any vegetation, has a dark brownish color, and we see three trees on the ground, spread out in a fan shaped pattern.

The second view was filmed with the worlds cheapest camera. It’s out of focus, but now we see the turret is completely covered by the tarp. The berm in front of the BMP is covered by brownish vegetation or dirt. The 3 knocked down trees are gone. And we see a field covered by almost bright green grass. Due to the bad quality of the video, we wouldn’t even know the BMP was there, were it not for the tarp.

For filming the shooter, all of a sudden a good quality camera (cellphone) was suddenly available. As focus and video quality are again fantastic.

Apparently the good quality camera was lost while the the anti tank rocket was in flight. As now a shitty camera was used again to film the impact, lol

Why isn’t there a drone view of the rocket impact?

The drone view looks like it was filmed during cold weather. The impact view looks like it was filmed during warm weather.

The main issue is that neither the As, Fs, Bs or AHs showed up in significant numbers. Ask a ground pounder how much CAS they ever had. I bet it rounds to about 10 for every 200 missions. Some more, some less. We got almost no CAS, no route clearance and no interdiction missions. 

In Vietnam it peaked at ~420,000 sorties a year and averaged ~200,000 for a decade. In modern times, with two wars simultaneously, the air forces put up a tiny fraction of those numbers. Meanwhile we had troopers driving over suspected IEDs to clear routes for the infantry, and no one seemed to want to fly over any of the routes to keep them free of emplacement teams.  

So, while you have memories of 6 fighters going out fully loaded, we should have been expecting ~400 such sorties every day. 

I’ll ask you, if you don’t mind, some of what I’ve asked other USAF maintainers/crew chiefs.

&gt;“They just toss them there. And then later it’s easier to make as if they disappeared without a trace. It’s easier for them to pretend they are just missing, and that’s it,” he said, noting that “there are thousands.”

&gt;“There’s nowhere left to place them. It’s a dump. I’m telling you in plain Russian—a dump. It’s as tall as a person,” he said, adding that the site is “fenced off, sealed, they don’t let anyone in.”

&gt;According to him, the only reason local authorities at the dump site let the woman find her brother was because she paid “good money.”

We know, that at least 2 crossings were destroyed. We've seen upwards of 60 vehicles disabled or abandoned. That is all we can say with certainty. Everything else are rumors and speculations.   


There are reports of two more crossings. And we can assume, that the force gathered for such an attack would be considerable. Probably 3-4 BTGs, but we don't know how much of it would be in the first echelon. Could be only two.   


The amount of gear lost that we can actually see is somewhat less, than a full BTG. It is still a huge losses. And we can assume, there is more. But in any case it mostly looks disabled and abandoned. We can not see any corpses. So, everyone, who didn't die inside the vehicles were able to run away and take their wounded with them. It is rare for even a fully broken unit to lose more than 20-30% in a single engagement.   


The big unknown is the amount that was able to cross - and then cut off. But it is highly doubtful to be a large number. AFU wouldn't be able to clear full BTGs worth from their side that quickly. I'd say, there is a high probability of SoF and recon elements being deployed forward.

&gt;Mamulashvili said he needs a fast, quiet vehicle to get sniper teams to a location where they can fire off shots for about five to 10 minutes, then quickly get out before the Russians rain artillery down on their position.

&gt;Built by a company called ELEEK in Ternopil, the Atom Military has a top speed of 90 kph, can travel up to 150 km on one five-hour charge and can carry up to 150 kg, according to the company. They have a motorcycle suspension, brakes and wheels “which allow them to be durable on the off-road.”

&gt;They even come with an optional USB for charging gadgets and a 220V socket so that additional heavy, bulky batteries aren’t needed.
