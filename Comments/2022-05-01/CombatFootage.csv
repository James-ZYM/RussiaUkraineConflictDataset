Extremely curious what you think likely to happen in a quickly reunified Korea that would have compared to America bombing every structure with a roof in the North and all the attendent slaughter of such a long war? What, some kind of famine worse than any the North had anyway despite in that timeline having access to more, better farmland. Some kind of reprisals even though the North occupied like all of Korea at one point and the reprisals were nowhere near the kind of scale that would result in that. 

&gt; also not realising Mao had no interest in opening the economy

That's not something I said one way or the other. I said they did open it up as soon as they got the chance, and it suggests even greater possibilities for Korea. And also Mao may have been against certain market reforms, but he wasn't actually against opening up the economy in itself. It was closed to the extent it was because of America orchaestrated sanctions. You think he would have opposed foreign sanctions on China being lifted? You know you can still sell products made in countries like Maoist China to other countries,. 

&gt;Also Korea straight jumping to the kind of state you have in mind makes me think you don't know 

Really starting to seem like I know more than you.

Reddit has a lot of morbid subs and I'm subbed to most of them, but I wouldn't go so far to say I am ""entertained"" by them. Morbid curiosity is very different from your run of the mill entertainment. Part of its allure are the emotions it evokes in you. Fear, sympathy, loathing, just a general heightened emotional state that you receive from viewing something traumatic. Same reason why so many women love reading/listening/watching true crime documentaries when so many of those crimes are literally targeting other women. 

My concern is that this sub has a lot of people who managed to completely separate all of the suffering in this war from reality and see it as a game, either vidya- or sportsball- like. 

What's even more depressing to watch is the bullshit contrasting that ass-ignorant Westerners try to construct, a veritable alternate reality. Apparently Ukrainians are this and this and this and Russians are like that and that and that. When in reality, having lived there for half my life, I can attest to the fact that you literally were not able to tell the difference between Russia and Ukraine before 2014. I mean, yeah, fucking Putin that bitch, that's a big difference, but like, the people are quite literally the same. Russian state propaganda machine rotted some people away, but that's nothing new, US has Fox to zombify people into nationalistic cunts too, and Ukraine had a small but rather vocal and powerful far-right minority as well. 

Ukraine and Russia are so similar that there weren't really even accents like Americans or Brits would assume. Something I've always found odd is that Russian has no regional accents really that you can definitively pin down, like you can easily do in Anglophone countries. Russian has *foreign* accents, like stereotypical Georgian or Armenian or Chechen accents for example, but that's not the same as a homegrown regional accent. People in Ukraine famously do a soft ""g"" sound instead of the hard ""g"" and more ""o"" than ""a"" sounds unlike Russian which is reverse, so ""propaganda"" becomes ""propohanda"" in Ukrainian accent, but many Russians do it too, particularly in Southern Russia for the G thing and just a lot of rural regions do more O sounds than A. I realise this is getting close to that ""regional"" accent thing but it's just one thing and not particularly common.",3f72a0731e9ac9158d1e798e344d46276207060f,True,False,,,,,0,1651448527,,0,{},i6yspjr,False,t3_ug8dkw,False,True,t1_i6yr62h,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ug8dkw/russian_special_forces_destroying_a_ukrainian/i6yspjr/,1651448540,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651419727.0,

In essence, Westerners or Americans specifically see Ukraine as entertainment along the lines of vidya and cheer for ""their"" team but when they see their own countrymen die they have a visceral reaction because they have an actually fitting reaction to it: a reaction that finds death of a fellow human as not purely entertaining, but actually upsetting.

Obviously a thousand other people noticed this, this is literally why people give a shit about Ukrainians dying but literally could not care less about Yemenis getting bombed to shit. Africa, Middle East and most of Asia isn't even human to most Westerners.

The whole logic on Korea is North Korea being a bad place to live now, therefore the South losing War means all of Korea would be like North Korea in the worst of ways.

This ignores that the Korean war and post war US sanctions are defining factors in what North Korea is now like, South Korea wasn't better than North Korea for decades after the war, and South Korea only improved to the degree it did because America was bankrolling them while trying to suffocate the South. 

Alternatively a timeline where the North quickly wins the Korean war and isn't sanctioned and sabotaged could easily have ended up with many millions fewer dead and the entire peninsula having the advantages and level of developement South Korea currently has.

Bear in mind that you actually have a proven model for that in the form of China. They went from Maoism to where they are now just through the US deciding to engage economically with them half as favorably as they do South Korea, and this despite originally having just as hardline a government as North Korea.

From NY Times:

&gt;Ukrainian officials learned of the visit, the Ukrainian official said, but not in time to catch General Gerasimov. When Ukrainian forces launched an attack on one position visited by General Gerasimov, at School No. 12 in the Russian-controlled city of Izium on Saturday   
evening, he had already departed for Russia.   
&gt;  
&gt;Still, some 200 soldiers, including at least one general, were killed, the Ukrainian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military operation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence assessments, confirmed that General Gerasimov had been in eastern Ukraine for the past couple days, but had no information about the attack on the Russian base. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our working assumption is that he was there because there’s a recognition they haven’t worked out all their problems yet,” said one of  the officials.

1. They've identified some of the callers in independent media. Names, addresses, phone numbers etc.. I think the families have even confirmed some. You don't do that for fake calls.

2. There is background to why it happened. Destroyed cell phone towers, electronic warfare, a lack of encrypted radios, and looting caused Russian Soldiers to use Ukrainian cell phones, allowing the intercepts to occur. This is completely plausible. In fact, Russian soldiers have been captured carrying stolen Ukrainian cell phones.

3. While Ukraine might have a reason to fabricate evidence, they have plenty of evidence already. Plenty of support from western partners. What do they need the calls? Faking the phone calls would inevitably be caught and would undermine their credibility to western partners at a desperate time. What is the benefit to some minor additional evidence if it would drastically effect your credibility? I obviously can't say they're real, but there are also compelling reasons for Ukraine NOT to make up this sort of evidence since it is made unnecessary by Russia's cavalier attitude to war crimes.

4. If they're fake, they've done a good job. No one has yet caught them with any compelling evidence they're fake such as duplicated actors, scripts, identifying participants in the scheme, etc..

That said, even if 99/100 are real, some might be fake. The same thing applies to the rest of the evidence.  I can post reports from qualified experts on why Russia didn't have time to properly reconstitute their BTG's from Kyiv, but if you sit there and refuse to accept the evidence as valid we're back at square one.

[Russia’s top officer visited the front line to change the offensive’s course, U.S. and Ukraine officials say.](https://archive.ph/UQiXE)

*The chief of the general staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the country’s highest ranking uniformed officer, made a visit to dangerous front-line positions in eastern Ukraine late last week in an effort to “change the course” of Russia’s flagging offensive there, according to a senior Ukrainian official. Two U.S. officials with knowledge of the visit also backed that assessment.*

*Ukrainian officials learned of the visit, the Ukrainian official said, but not in time to catch General Gerasimov. When Ukrainian forces launched an attack on one position visited by General Gerasimov, at School No. 12 in the Russian-controlled city of Izium on Saturday evening, he had already departed for Russia. Still, some 200 soldiers, including at least one general, were killed, the Ukrainian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive military operation.*

Lots of other good info in the article too.

It increases ballistic performance, as bullets keep gaining speed in the right direction. For a little longer at least.

It also hides the flare, so you don't burn grass, cloth or anything too close to the barrel.

Also most amunition is 'smokeless' nowadays, but when firing at high rates there's a visible trail of smoke.

Sounds all good so, why not make it part of every gun then? Suppressors are expensive and wear off, you don't want to waste it if not necessary. Plus, it works differently with different amunitions, that's why there's no universal design; you change rounds that make a bigger flare and you need a different suppressor. And it catches all the dust and powder inside, so you have to take it apart and clean it. Also, soundwise, you may want the sound to go frontward? Or just quieter? Or you don't care as much for sound if it makes the barrel a little shorter.

3.  Tanks can't see all around them. they're inside a giant metal box. Infantry does that for them. Same with hearing threats, an infantryperson will likely hear a plane coming before a tank can. They also points out targets for the tank to destroy. More eyes/ears is better.

4. Tanks can get hit with anti-tank weapons carried by soldiers, like RPGs, but those soldiers are in-turn, vulnerable to being shot by infantry (or spotted) before they can fire.  The infantry ""supress"" threats to the tank the same way the tank supresses threats to the infantry. A tank alone can't engage a lot of infantry all at one.  They move around too fast and they can get too close where the tank can't hit them.  Infantry prevents people from getting too close to the tank.

887,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"1. You need to understand something.  Saying you're neutral or saying both sides lie does not make you more accurate, objective or correct in your assessments.  In fact, trying to equalize bias with false equivalency will make you less accurate, not more accurate. I'll give you an example.  Bob and Jim both tell you that Coca Cola and Pepsi are merging. Bob says the stock will go down, Jim says it will go up.  Both have biases.  Now, if you consider both equal, you'll never be able to tell which is likely correct and will likely come to a bad conclusion.  If however you assess reliability, credibility and corroboration, you're far more likely to be correct in assessing which way Coca Cola's stock will go.  The same thing applies in this situation. 

2. ""the US (and the Uk) have been found to concoct massive lies to justify military action in the near past, and I fully expect they will do the same (lie) if they feel they need to to accomplish their objectives."" No one is stopping you from using past history to your assessment of credibility, but intellectual honesty requires you to do the same to an even greater extent for Russia who lies much more frequently and much more gratuitously 

3. ""OSINT draws from the same intel agencies that are currently allied with Ukraine and fighting Russia.""  This is false, OSINT draws from independent media, social media, and a hundred other sources. They do not use data or information from government agencies.  In fact, their users are often in opposition to government agencies.  Literally OSINT just means Open Source Intelligence which, by definition cannot originate from a Government agency.

Do I think the west should let Ukraine be overrun? I'm not sure what I'd like the west to do. I do not think Russia should have invaded; I think the war is a crime. Conversely, I am not a fan of NATO, the ""west"", etc., nor of their ideology. I would not like to see increased US/western influence in that region or in any. I don't think a western intervention would be driven by humanitarian concerns, but by geostrategic concerns, and I am therefore skeptical about the aims of such an intervention. I am also wary of the west's way of making war, which is sure to include things like funding and arming neo-Nazis, and indeed this has already been occurring.

For instance, we like assess the **credibility and reliability**  We do this by looking at things like internal/external consistency, capacity, their biases, their ability to make concessions that hurt their situation, the probabilities involved, the timing, etc..  In this case, Russia claims don't have an air of reality.  They aren't backed by OSINT data of photographed losses.  Further, their claims about killed Ukrainians and destroyed vehicles/equipment aren't backed by pre-war reporting on the size of the Ukrainian army. Russian claims don't logically make sense, they're the attacker and they're attacking well defended positions their losses SHOULD be higher than Ukraine's. They aren't providing timely updates either and they're unwilling to make any concessions to their narrative harmful to their cause. Russia also offers no supporting evidence of their claims that we could verify. Russia is not very credible or reliable. Meanwhile Ukraine's claims are backed up by OSINT data (except for aircraft/helicopters). Their claims are also in-line with verified losses of equipment. Also, Ukraine is making claims that are easily verifiable (such as being in possession of 7K corpses).  Why make that claim if Russia could easily undermine Ukraine's credibility by proving it wrong?  Ukraine is providing timely updates and even admissions that could hurt their situation.  Although both are likely to be biased or self-serving, the sheer weight of additional criteria heavily weighs towards Ukraine

2.  We also look at **corroboration**.  In this case, as you can see above, Russia's losses are corroborated by a significant number of sources (some good and some bad) and are fairly consistent with one another.   Ukraine meanwhile has two estimates within range of one another and one that is completely outside the others. Again, this leads us to trust the estimates of Ukraine (and others) and distrust Russia's claims.

I mean, we could analyze this a lot, but I think you get the idea:  Russia is untrustworthy and we don't have a good idea of Ukraine's losses, and we do have a good idea about Russia's losses, even though it is imperfect.",c832b85a67243ad3d2c67123e3fa61eb5dd13716,True,False,,,,,0,1651437042,,0,{},i6y3k8u,False,t3_ufo4nj,False,True,t1_i6y0mtb,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufo4nj/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_5122/i6y3k8u/,1651437054,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651408242.0,

First, it's fairly obvious Russia's initial plan was to simply march across Ukraine while horrified Ukrainians surrender or flee. It's hard to imagine any other conditions under which that would have worked. It was a very stupid plan and didn't work.

When you look at overall situation it was quite clear they wouldn't be able to take Kyiv in case of organized and massive resistance. They also failed to secure supply lines as they were moving too fast, and they couldn't both advance towards Kyiv and protect 200km long front line against Ukrainian attacks on supply lines at the same time.

Russian leadership realized Kyiv offensive won't succeed and will either collapse or those troops would simply be more useful somewhere else and cancelled all the operations in northern Ukraine.

Here the supply lines are shorter and better protected, Russia is using their air power much more than near Kyiv to attack Ukrainian positions and Russia is way more determined. They could abandon Kyiv offensive to focus on eastern Ukraine, they won't abandon eastern Ukraine because they have nowhere else. 

I believe if push comes to the shove, Putin will order mobilization, but they're still trying to avoid it if they can. By the way, Russia has around 200k of its troops in Ukraine, despite such horrible planning and massive blunders, they still managed to take a good chunk of territory, hold it and inflict lots of casualties. Adding only 50k more soldiers (and Russia conscripts around 130k annually) could make a successful Ukrainian offensive in Donbas impossible. 

We also have no reliable information on how much casualties, Ukrainian army there has taken - western sources admit RuAF is doing 300 sorties per day. We know these aren't any kind of strikes deep in Ukrainian territory (they're doing that with cruise missiles), all activity is close to the line of contact. Add Russian artillery to the equation and it seems impossible to me that Ukrainians don't have lots of casualties as well.",131f71324366b6439199f874c864f337856c92e1,True,False,,,,,0,1651436597,,0,{},i6y2k1i,False,t3_ufo4nj,False,True,t1_i6x8wco,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufo4nj/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_5122/i6y2k1i/,1651436611,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651407797.0,

&gt;	full up jamming environments is not there 

Have you ever dealt with a ‘full up jamming environment?’ It’s not fully effective even vs voice comms. Jamming just isn’t ‘all powerful.’ 1) The jammers are easily targeted as they announce their positions, 2) are not fully effective when mitigated by frequency hopping; 3) and are more fully mitigated by multiple, simultaneous, and self correcting freq hopping comms. You also assume RF comms. There is no reason to think this will be the only means of communication. IR comms for autonomous drones have been demonstrated in DARPA research going back decades. How do you propose to jam IR comms?

&gt;	radios are fucking shit and everyone always overestimates their capabilities, 

Said by someone who’s never been to combat I’m guessing? Or, did you have some trouble on Guard? I don’t remember not having Guard coverage everywhere.  

&gt;	they don’t know that hills and trees fuck radio signals fast.

Ever heard of retrans? Ever heard of mesh networks? Existing tech counters these issues. As Internet of Things tech comes online, the ability to talk around and over LOS obstructions plummets. 

&gt;	everyone always overestimates 

It seems like you overestimate the validity of old assumptions. We don’t need one massive broadcast station, which is able to be targeted or subject to focused jamming. We are looking to field 100,000,000 drones and jamming short range transmissions (as you said) is hard to do.",4e2dce06b806747e110583d5bf88dfa9d4ccf430,True,False,,,,,0,1651432999,,0,{},i6xu8wi,False,t3_uflso1,False,True,t1_i6x98ri,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uflso1/another_downed_russian_ka52_with_ukrainian/i6xu8wi/,1651433012,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651404199.0,

Think of it like this, a 155 shell is something like $800, a guided one is $80K.

We'll probably never see a barrage of guided shells. At best, you get the first shell guided (so your first shell will always hit and that's before anyone goes into cover) and then a set of unguided. They're just too expensive, they won't have that many of them.

Also, the first batch of Ukraine trainers has just graduated (on Friday?). These are trainers, that are going to train the soldiers with the 155s. It's just not likely they're in combat yet. I haven't even seen any switchblades in action (and those come with video streams) and those were from the previous batch.

Also, Ukraine already had guided shells (they have their own factory that makes them).

*Any* country would struggle to perform CAS in these conditions. The US likely would just perform high altitude precision strikes to get around that though and keep CAS sorties to a minimum. 

I don’t know if there’s any data about how Russia is using their Air Force currently. We see lots of videos of SU-25s flying low, but truthfully they’re purpose built ground attack aircraft so I don’t think that’s necessarily an indication that they can’t perform high altitude sorties. The most recent reports are that Russia is performing over 100 sorties a day, so there’s gotta be a solid chance that they’ve got high altitude missions being performed as well.

Guys who we know were fighting are doing training, getting a break in Kyiv, etc.. This will pay off in the long run.  I know it sucks losing ground to the Russians now, and not having a superiority of numbers because not everyone is at the front, but these guys were on the front line for a month and it sounds bad enough. 

For comparison, Russia has been the attack and for two months. It is almost a certainty they have worse food, worse accommodations, worse equipment, harder fighting as the attacker, worse medicine, worse commanders, higher losses, and even ""blocking detachments"".  Rather than relieve them, Russia apparently keeps making promises that they never fulfill about relief and keep throwing their units into the fire. What's that going to do with unit effectiveness if they can only muster 30% of unit strength for an attack? 

I read in another post that ""Gerasimov accused Dvornikov of insufficient zeal and understanding of the plans transmitted from the General Staff."" which sounds exactly like Russian command doesn't understand the realities of the fighting and the effectiveness of the force they have.

At the end of the day Russia still has manpower out the ass compared to Ukraine and are the ones holding a bunch of territory. The West can pump weapons into Ukraine until they're armed like a First World nation but if Russia drags this out long enough they could win the manpower game in the end. Conscription or not Russia has 3 times the population of Ukraine. 

This conclusion of this war will depend on two things: who's holding on to what and which side gives up the ghost first. If Ukraine calls it quits while Russia has control of their territory, Russia wins. Losses aside, if Russia is able to manipulate Ukraine into staying out of NATO and they pick up some of their territory then they've won.

Either way, I think it's safe to say this far in that Russia has resolved to slug this thing out until they get a favorable outcome, or at least they'll try. Given the Ukrainians apparent lack of offensive capability, I'm not confident they're going to win the war no matter how bad the Russian casualties and materiel losses are, as sad as that is to say.",22c39b22ae117e596ca7dfc209df14ea180d5cf8,True,False,,,,,0,1651430527,,0,{},i6xogmb,False,t3_uflso1,False,True,t1_i6uvnn3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uflso1/another_downed_russian_ka52_with_ukrainian/i6xogmb/,1651430543,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651401727.0,

&gt; Exhausted Ukrainian soldiers return from eastern front
&gt; Packed with exhausted Ukrainian soldiers with clenched jaws, the truck drives away at full speed. The troops from the 81st brigade have just received an order to withdraw from the eastern front where Russian forces advance.
&gt; 
&gt; The brigade walked 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) Saturday, camouflaged in the woods and under crossfire, until their point of retreat at Sviatoguirsk.
&gt; 
&gt; For a month, the 81st -- whose motto is ""always first"" -- battled to push back the Russian advance in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region where Moscow's troops move forward slowly, taking villages one by one.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Everyone understands that we must guard the line here, we cannot let the enemy move closer, we try to hold it with all our force,"" says lieutenant Yevgen Samoylov, anxious that the unit could be hit by Russian fire at any point.
&gt; 
&gt; ""As you can hear, the enemy is very, very near,"" he says, pointing to the sky. The line of Russian tanks is on the other side of a hill, around seven kilometres (4.3 miles) away.
&gt; 
&gt; At 21 years old, Samoylov, an officer from the Odessa military academy, finds himself managing 130 conscripts, often twice his age.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It's my first war. I was supposed to graduate in four months, but they sent me here,"" says the baby-faced officer with a short black beard.
&gt; 
&gt; Samoylov, who goes by the nom de guerre ""Samson"", never leaves his red notebook alone. He takes notes of every movement, but also each request and remark by the soldiers whom he always addresses with a soft voice.
&gt; 
&gt; - Deadly silence -
&gt; 
&gt; The unit swung into action on February 23, a day before Russia launched the invasion.
&gt; 
&gt; At the start of the war, they spent a month defending Izium, which fell on April 1, before joining the fighting around the village of Oleksandrivka.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Some really difficult battles,"" says the quiet Samoylov.
&gt; 
&gt; In this brigade, like the others, they don't say how many people have been killed.
&gt; 
&gt; When the subject comes up, Samoylov's gaze becomes misty. The pain is raw.
&gt; 
&gt; A deadly silence takes over the military truck during the drive to the abandoned building where the soldiers will stay during their week of rest.
&gt; 
&gt; When the convoy passes a truck loaded with long-range missiles dashing to the front, the soldiers automatically make a ""V"" sign for victory with their fingers before fixing their gaze once more on their feet or the horizon in silence.
&gt; 
&gt; On arrival at the base, the soldiers unload their weapons, remove their kit and immediately go into one of the dilapidated rooms without electricity where they undergo a medical examination after returning from the front.
&gt; 
&gt; For the survivors, ""there are small injuries on the forehead, those who were buried under the rubble during a bombing have fractures and (injuries) linked to shrapnel,"" says Vadym Kyrylov, the brigade's doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; ""But we mainly see somatic problems, like hypertension or chronic illnesses that have worsened,"" the 25-year-old adds.
&gt; 
&gt; - 'Trench foot' -
&gt; 
&gt; The men also greatly suffer from ""trench foot"" syndrome caused by prolonged exposure to moisture, unsanitary conditions or the cold.
&gt; 
&gt; ""For a month they are not able to dry their shoes... so there are many feet-related injuries, mainly fungi and infections,"" the doctor says.
&gt; 
&gt; After the medical visit, they all have the same reflex: to isolate and use their phone to call a female partner, a child or a parent.
&gt; 
&gt; Soldiers cannot use their phones on the front, and any application that requires geolocation is banned.
&gt; 
&gt; Four soldiers reassemble the rusty metal bed frames and sweep the floor coated with dust to make a semblance of a room.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It's the moment for the guys to relax, to take care of their physical and psychological injuries, to regain their strength before returning to battle,"" Samoylov says.
&gt; 
&gt; ""They'll sleep warm, eat normal food and try to more or less get back on their feet.""

I'll just say this, marginalizing and stereotyping, which happens everywhere, is horrible. It leads to fear and hate, and that leads to horrendous things. 

It's used by the Russians right now to justify their way in Ukraine. It's used by the west to justify the ear on terror. It's used by China to justify genocide against Muslims. It's a scourge on humanity that we should fight against in every instance. 

It's not a bad thing necessary to call it ""orientalism"" when referring to specifically Asian people's, but the problem is that the problem is everywhere. It's not bad to bring attention to a specific part of it, but I think it's important understand that it's more than just anti Asian sentiment.

The only time it's acceptable to use terms like ""barbaric"" is when referring to specific actions. Like the mass killings by Russian soldiers in Bucha, or Nazi concentration camps, or killing of an entire village by America troops in Vietnam. These are barbaric actions and deserve to be labeled as such. It doesn't however make every Russian, or German, or American responsible.

Imagine the launcher is like a fighter/gun that shoots missiles/bullets.  An old timey fighter shot bullets, but bullets didn't self-correct if they missed, they went in a straight line.  Missiles were better, they launched and corrected themselves to hit a target based on guidance from lasers, GPS, or heat signature. 

Things like switchblade is the next stage of munitions beyond bullets and missiles. A human on the ground it actually controlling the ""bullet/missile"" to correct it's course before it detonates.

Such a comment would be quite unsubstantiated however, as the RKG-3 is a well proven design with penetration values of, depending on the exact model, between 125mm and 220mm RHA - so more than enough to penetrate the top armor of said tanks (although ERA may be a problem). Nevertheless, if such a grenade hits the MBT somewhere outside of the combat compartment, then the result will be not nearly as devastating and may even leave the tank in an operable state.",1020f354dc963095ee9fea211ddbab6f6fa2eddf,True,False,,,,,0,1651428380,,0,{},i6xjiu3,False,t3_ug39y1,False,True,t1_i6x8a9m,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ug39y1/drone_destroys_a_russian_tank_with_a_cumulative/i6xjiu3/,1651428395,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651399580.0,

The original post was explaining why it was easier to draw good estimates about Russian losses and much harder for Ukraine (fewer and much less reliable claims). 

Keep in mind, in my previous post, I extrapolated over 60 days and we're at 66 now, so a 10% bump wouldn't be unreasonable. Also, fighting seems to be ""up and down"". it was very heavy in the first few days, decrease and increased and decreased two more times according to some watchers. It is hard to maintain a consistent ""level"" of casualties.  That said OSINT data tells us that the ""rate"" of materiel loss"" has been pretty steady, despite the ups and downs in fighting, so the casualties are likely the same.

3. Ukraine Claims as of April 26, 2022: 22,400 Russian Losses https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/827539.html. Ukraine further claims to be in possession of 7K Russian bodies. That seems like a claim likely to backfire fi they don't have those bodies.

7. OSINT Equipment Losses by Oryx from April 26: 3237 vs 920. Ratio of destroyed and captured equipment has been relatively steady for the whole war. 3 to 1. Which is consistent for an attacker operating against a fairly equal opponent with relatively similar troop levels. This should also be consistent with troop ratios of losses.

8. Russian MoD from from March 2, 2022, 498 Russian Losses (Extrapolated to 5,976 over 60 days).

I have one more I found on twitter, but I don't know where he is getting his data, so I'll have to wait on a reply. Someone also replied to my post with another possible lead that I'll be looking into. As you can see though, I have not been able to find any good data points for Ukrainian losses. We know that Ukraine has reason to downplay losses and Russia has reason to play-up Ukrainian losses. The US estimate meanwhile has HUGE swings.

*Issues with Russian Claims of Ukrainian Losses* 

 Russian claims are completely outrageous. They've also claimed to have destroyed more tanks, IFvs, TB2s, SAMs, Artillery, etc.. than Ukraine possessed before the war, which, if true, would mean Ukraine had zero Tanks, IFvs, TB2s, SAMs, Artillery, left. We can see from the results on the ground this is horseshit. Also, if we factor in killed+ Casualties, more than 1/2 of Ukraine's army is killed and wounded and would be on the verge of collapse. Which, again, doesn't look like the case from all other points we can call upon.

Further, there are like, a dozen threads on twitter where Russia has been caught by OSINT people not just faking claims, but actually faking war footage to make themselves appear more successful. Moving crashed drones to multiple sites and pretending it was multiple shoot downs, showing the same footage mirrored, claiming Russian losses in materiel were actually Ukrainian losses despite evidence of Russian markings, photographing the same vehicle from multiple angles and claiming it multiple times, etc.. Examples below.

The US's problem is that it's in the grip of greedy capitalists who spend vast amounts of money controlling the political agenda in order to make vastly more money back through low taxes, low public spending and relaxed regulations.

Claiming that it's either a military or free healthcare is exactly what the wealthy who're robbing Americans blind want you to think. Israel spends far more of its GDP on its military than the US, but has free universal healthcare.

Worse still, the US would actually save money with universal free healthcare. As you can see [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268826/health-expenditure-as-gdp-percentage-in-oecd-countries/), the US spends a higher percentage of its GDP than any other country in the world on healthcare. (17%!) Countries with free, universal healthcare typically pay 7-10% of their GDP. The reason America pays double is to pay for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and private hospitals/healthcare services to make vast profits.

Ditto for higher education spending. As shown [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/707557/higher-education-spending-share-gdp/), the US pays far more for higher education than countries with free higher education. Again, the extra money goes to loan companies and for-profit educational institutions.

You're being robbed. The wealthy donors and lobbyists keeping your politicians from fixing this situations ARE the same people skimming off 1% of the US's GDP on education and 7-10% of the US's GDP on healthcare. You would be $100,000s richer over the course of your entire lifetime if not for these people plundering the US's wealth. The US military budget (3.5% of GDP) is absolute chickenfeed compared to what's being skimmed off the US's economy.

Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation, was hit by a Ukrainian missile strike in the Izyum region.
Gerasimov was at the command post of the Russian grouping of troops near Izyum when a Ukrainian Tochka U rocket hit nearby.
As a result of the strike, about 10 people were injured, mostly senior officers. Three people died, according to our information. Among them, perhaps, one general.
Gerasimov is now known for sure that he was wounded and evacuated to the rear. It has not yet been possible to find out how seriously the chief of the Russian General Staff was wounded.
Information about the shelling and hit near the command post was given to us by two sources among senior officers of the Russian army. One is at the scene, the second learned about what happened through the operational summary.
Gerasimov arrived near Izyum a few days ago. According to sources in the General Staff, Putin sent him to Ukraine after Gerasimov complained about Dvornikov (the commander of the group).

It doesn't work when at very low altitude **with the nose pitched up 30-45 degrees**. It does work at altitude and with the nose pitched down, level, or just a bit up. 

Can you explain why this is not possible at all and what's the difference? Assuming that the terrain is more or less flat (no high mountains or hills). The observable distance to the Earth horizon from these altitudes allows that. The rotating optical guidance station is certainly capable of lock on the target. Then targeting computer chooses a optimal position for the rockets launch. We don't know how automated it is or how precise the pilot action needs to be. But we can clearly see that this method works with a small pitch-up angles. So why shouldn't it work with other angles? I'll repeat againt, they fireing stabilized rockets with a continuously working engines (until the max effective range of reckets not exceeded) and nearly identical solid fuel load, not fireworks!

&gt;In all clips of the low-level, pitch-up tactic, the screen looks completely different. I've also never seen any footage of a target being hit by this tactic.

In the clips, they only show what is allowed by military censorship. Have you ever seen a footage from Ukraine where the salvo launch of an unguided rockets on a locked on target was synchronized with the HUD of a attack helicopter? A propaganda footages with flight above forests, where _no target was locked on_, does not prove technical inability to do such attacks.

It does not describe sins so that you can/should emulate them.",32a922f718f7898496c6b3659e37603d23280568,True,False,,,,,0,1651424075,,0,{},i6x9hd9,False,t3_ufgrhl,False,True,t1_i6whhlu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufgrhl/chechens_of_the_rosgvardiya_shouting_we_will_have/i6x9hd9/,1651424093,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651395275.0,

Based on what Russia is going to ""mobilize the rest of their military""? Why they haven't done it yet if that is so easy thing to do?

&gt;If Ukraine was in a position to meaningfully counter attack then they would have already.

Why? Their position is constantly getting stronger as they get more weapons from the West. Especially for NATO weapons they need to get their soldiers trained before they can be used as they have no experience using them. Furthermore, Russia's attack is not finished yet. It's better to let that die out and then when Russia is reeling with the losses hit it back as hard as you can. That's exactly what the Soviets did in Stalingrad. They drew the Germans into a very costly urban fight and when they were spent, they hit them with a counter attack that got the Germans destroyed. They actually did also earlier counter attacks (Kotluban offensives), which were actually very costly and got nowhere. Ukraine rather does one successful counter-offensive than gets its men killed in counter-attacks that are done too early.

Using the US Marines as an example, they are generally seen as one of the premier ""standardized"" large scale light infantry forces in the world. In other words, they're still categorized as grunts in the larger command structure. Their doctrine includes two particular characteristics which help make them so effective, even though small arms ammunition isn't of great concern based on the budget supporting them.

1. All US Marines are capable small-arms infantry riflemen regardless of their sub-specialty (MOS).

2. All US Marines are trained to be expert marksman, where each shot is intended to be accurate and virtually every shot is to be fired using semi-auto versus the M27's full-auto select fire (unless there's the specific intent for suppressive fire or they're an assigned machine-gunner).

If it works for them, I'm going to say that's the more effective route to go. The USMC is also designed as a combined arms fighting force, so they have heavy weapons squads too and are trained to use automatic machine gun launchers. Even then (per live fire training video), accuracy is emphasized with targets out to several hundred meters. I believe optics are also standard issue.

True, not yet. I was talking about the potential in a long war. I don't see any particular obstacle for that. In normal countries the limit comes from the fact that you need to run the civilian side of the economy at the same time as you're fighting the war, but if the West is willing to bankroll Ukraine, they don't even have to worry about that (except of course for the essential services that can't be bought by money).

But it changes the playing field completely as the main question is what's the response from the west. Considering no one has ever used a nuclear bomb vs another country for almost 80 years, it's really hard to know what's going to happen. So for this one, I won't argue with you - it's your assumption vs mine and we could both be completely wrong 

Yes, they have leverage over the EU with oil exports, they're also knee-deep in sanctions with a hurting economy. Not sure what your argument here is though as the west has clearly shown support for Ukraine with ramping up the size of weapon supplies they're shipping to Ukraine - unless it's to defend your argument of having a reaction vs. a use of a nuclear weapon.

I'd be also careful to assume the role of China here as China is heavily reliant on the west, given the size of their economy, much more than Russia. Yes, they're sitting on two chairs and using the situation to their advantage, but they haven't given Russia clear support (it will hurt them a lot of they do - we will see if they go that avenue as it's super super risky)

But I still don't understand the logic of insufficient manpower if you go to nukes. Nukes negate manpower, they take them out of the equation completely.

On, to my assumptions:
1. We can see reports going all over (with confirmations as well) about the west shipping large quantities of different types of weapons and supplies to Ukraine, and they've been increasing consistently from the start of the war.
2. We can also see reports of a number of Ukrainian people being trained in other countries as well as enlisted in service. Ukraine has around 14 million male population between 18 and 65 years old (depending which source you look at). That's a big pool of people, even if we say only 10% of that can be trained and enlisted in the war, it's still a really big number compared to what Russia currently has on the ground.
3. We can't see any reports of Russia heavily reinforcing their troops in Ukraine and we don't see the state of their weapons and supplies in reserve.

The question there is only if Russia can partially mobilize and if they can supply them in a good way.

That's why my overview of the situation is that at the moment, Ukraine is in a good spot manpower wise, and Russia isn't. What will happen, we'll see.",f23613b1e36904c73f23f4c4effd0182a0533891,True,False,,,,,0,1651419709,,0,{},i6wzcwz,False,t3_ufo4nj,False,True,t1_i6wwcbn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufo4nj/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_5122/i6wzcwz/,1651419722,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651390909.0,

How many losses do you think Ukraine could sustain? 

They are a country of 40 million people. Even if they had taken the same amount of military losses as Russia has (of the order of 25 000) it would not have dented much their manpower potential.  

The bottom line is that Ukraine declared full mobilization on the first day of war, which means that it should be able to sustain at least a million men army assuming that the running of the rest of the economy is helped by Western economic support. Of course it would take some time to train all these people, but if this is going to be a long war, that's doable. 

Russia is in a different position. Putin ordered only a ""special military operation"", which won't let him to mobilize the reserves. Even using conscripts currently serving in the Russian military is actually illegal. And he doesn't want to declare a full war as that's tricky for his internal politics. So, he either has to continue fighting the war with his dwindling force of volunteer soldiers backed up by some mercenaries or declare the mobilization of reserves. The first one leads to a military defeat as Ukraine's forces are getting bigger and his smaller. The second one has a risk to lead to an internal revolt as people don't want to send their sons to this pointless war.",13126baf1fd69cf62cba2ca60361e5a536ede7ed,True,False,,,,,0,1651419214,,0,{},i6wy9c5,False,t3_ufo4nj,False,True,t1_i6wt2fh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufo4nj/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_5122/i6wy9c5/,1651419231,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651390414.0,

Laser guided artillery shells have been around a long time.... Krasnopol is Soviet era. But before the advent of cheap drones they were seen mostly as a curiosity, since there aren't many scenarios where a laser guided shell is useful without them. You needed an infantryman somewhere on the front lines pointing the laser at the target, which usually means the target is quite close and the infantryman might as well be using a portable missile instead. Or a manned aircraft pointing the laser, but then why not just drop a laser guided bomb? With drones though, suddenly you can't get enough of laser guided shells.

GPS guidance changes the game again. A spysat sees an enemy vehicle parked up somewhere? Hit it, no need to send a drone out. Angry old man finds a Russian BTR parked on his front lawn? He can phone up the military, give his address and they'll hit it. Firefight going on in a town? Call in the exact GPS of those sandbags the enemy is in cover behind. Stupid tiktok warrior live streaming shooting up traffic lights? Track his exact location and hit it. And of course... You can still use a drone to find targets, you just don't need the laser any more.

The automatic target recognition goes even further. Perhaps the spysat took the image 30 mins ago, and you don't know if the vehicle has been moved since then. No problem, the shell's guidance will find the vehicle you're aiming for if it's still there.

And yes, the other major advantage of these shells is to reduce collateral damage. The problem now is that NATO has vast quantities of 155mm rounds in existence, and Excalibur is quite slow to make. I believe about 150 are produced per month at the moment, however if they prove as successful as they should be in Ukraine then that might ramp up a notch. Still it will take decades to replace existing stockpiles of dumb ammunition, and doubtless encounter political resistance due to its high price tag, since replacing your stockpile of a million dumb rounds for 10,000 Excaliburs *feels* like a terrible decision if you're not familiar with the kind of complex inefficiencies the Excaliburs solve.",9a63ae9acf98e6136eb8104c1ae69865178b2eb6,True,False,,,,,0,1651418848,,0,{},i6wxfsg,False,t3_ufvgxy,False,True,t1_i6wshml,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufvgxy/russian_btr_destroyed_by_artillery_fire_directed/i6wxfsg/,1651418865,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651390048.0,

Not exactly sure how good Ukraine is at counter artillery, especially considering we are specifically talking about MLRS systems (tracked vehicles) that can relocate within minutes and RU has plenty of them. Ukraine doesn't have enough to counter the whole massive frontline anyway.

Plus this is a static frontline from over a month already. Not much manuvers going on, speed is an irrelevant factor currently.

Being virtually unguided being #1. It’s as close to being unguided as you can get, without totally being a rocket. The major advantage over the LAW is the NLAW’s warhead. Not it’s flight profile or guidance.  

To your list:

1.	I already noted that reports I’ve had put the prices very similar, now that the Jav is past 50,000. 
2.	 The Jav has tens of thousands in storage so doesn’t need to wait on production, and fits just about the same on a pallet. Or exactly the same, I haven’t seen how the NLAWs literally stack up. My guess though, is it’s 9 or 12 to a pallet. Could be 16 though. 
3.	 The Jav has as many available as the US is willing to make it, we have enough to kill every working tank on the planet. Even to illustrate the point, you want all of them you can get, it’s a question of the political decision to supply them, not a question of desire to have them. 
4.	 The Jav is 1.5-2 hours training time tops. One of the best things about it is the end users ease of use. 
5.	 It can be a pig. That’s true. 
6.	 Jav is very, very not complex. I can teach you in no time, if you’ve never trained on it. 
7.	 The Jav is very low on maintenance as the CLU has almost no moving parts. The NLAWs don’t all come with scopes as I understand it, so God help you if you lose one or have it damaged. Same as the Jav. 

All while the NLAW lacks the best warheads, has no homing guidance system, an incredibly short range by modern standards, and a cost that really isn’t all that great (like the Jav).",214a2e6d786d15abe2096d4550405fc0d580a7a3,True,False,,,,,0,1651415955,,0,{},i6wr1zb,False,t3_uf9gc1,False,True,t1_i6w13vw,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uf9gc1/sbu_firing_javelin_missiles_at_a_russian_bmd4/i6wr1zb/,1651415968,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651387155.0,

You know what else is also worth more than 70k? 50 dumb artillery rounds you'd need to fire to hit your target otherwise.

Also, Ukraine doesn't need to trade financially favourably anyway. What they need to do is win the war. A 100k missile to shoot down a 10k drone is still a good deal if it stops that drone guiding an artillery barrage that causes huge damage. 

Who knows what this BTR might have done had it not been destroyed... It could've killed a dozen Ukrainian soldiers. 70k is a bargain for keeping that firefight from happening. Ukrainian soldiers would have probably used a 100+k AT missile to take it out anyway.

And lastly, Ukraine isn't paying for these 70k rounds. The US and other Western countries are.

*Russia's original offensive across the theatre has stalled and fallen back (such as around Kyiv). There is an equivalent salient situation in eastern Ukraine with Russia having reinforced from units taken elsewhere and have launched a new attempt at an offensive to encircle large numbers of Ukrainian units.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**But the Soviets had surmised the German attack beforehand and had withdrawn their main forces from the obviously threatened positions within the salient.**

*Ukraine has expected this move by Russia since about 2014 - and have been preparing a defense in depth against a successful encirclement of their forces in the east since about 2014.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Germans launched their attack on July 5, but they soon encountered deep antitank defenses and minefields, which the Soviets had emplaced in anticipation of the attack. The Germans advanced only 10 miles (16 km) into the salient in the north and 30 miles (48 km) in the south, losing many of their tanks in the process.** 

*Very near the same result the Russians have achieved in their advancement attempts so far (being measured in just 10s of miles/kms).*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**At the height of the battle on July 12, the Soviets began to counterattack, having built up by then a marked preponderance of both troops and tanks. Their subsequent successes encouraged them to develop a broad offensive that recovered the nearby city of Orel (now Oryol) on August 5 and that of Kharkov (now Kharkiv, Ukraine) on August 23.**

*Ukraine has begun counter-attacks with successes but is otherwise exacting a high toll on Russian forces for their attempts to advance. Of particular note is Kharkiv, then as now. And otherwise, Ukraine seems to be otherwise preparing for widescale counterattacks across the east on their own timetable.* 

&amp;#x200B;

And indeed it has turned into shit in Egypt the Muslim brotherhood almost managed to take and keep power but was thankfully deposed by the military.   
  
To claim that a country run by a ruthless murderous dictator where people were literally terrified every moment of their lives, one little wrong statement towards the regime and they would be picked up never to be seen again is really special. Would you like to live in such a society yourself or is that just something you think is ok for those ""lesser"" people.   
  
The state during Saddams rule can be said to be secular even though there was a heavy element of person worship towards the dictator, but as with all such ""secular"" totalitarian states the religion survives in the population as we have seen across the East as well where religion exploded when the ""secular"" regimes fell.  
  
They dont get to pick anything they are run by dictators and rulers, and the alternatives in most would dismiss any choice as well if they gained power through elections like the Muslim Brotherhood.  
Holding extreme views does not make you a terrorist you will find in human populations the activist types the zealots willing to put everything on the line make up less than 5-10% but you will find a lot of passive support for those guys and when it comes to opressing minorities and dissidents and least but not last apostasy very many more are enganged in it.  
  
The saudis are among the biggest islamists out there today and a big danger to the western world during the whole cold war and beyond they have spent more on spreading their poison than even the Soviets spent on their foreign influencing. That they fight other sects that oppose their rule does not change that fact, they all want to follow the same pattern rule by heavenly mandate enforced by Sharia, just slightly different interpretations of it.  
  
That the middle east has extremists was and is not a justification, but no Dictatorship should be afforded any rights what so ever that does not mean we always should topple them but any government that feels they could has every moral justification to do so. If you actually think a dictatorship should have the same rights as a free society where people elect their leaders than you are either presenting an argument where some people are considered lesser than yourself so they can just wallow in that misery or you are accepting a future where you yourself could end up living in such a society.  
  
Hitchens did a great debate against one of the stooges for totalitarian states in the west on that topic he says it far better than I ever could.

But nevertheless they are stabilized in flight. their engines has a long enough operation time after launch. We can see how at a range of 3800 meters the scattering of salvo launch shows a better results than BM-21.  At least from the first salvo, as real war practice demonstrates. I mean the probability of a Grad's gunner making a mistake is much higher. The gunner on a Kamov has a better view, is able to quickly change the position (direction) for shooting, uses the capabilities of automation.

Visual demonstration in this video's end: https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tgl0s4/allegedly_newly_released_footage_of_a_russian/ (skip until 1:07 time mark) Yes, the missiles did not reach a bit (it looks like an unlucky salvo, or _perhaps_ a strong wind in the desert interfered). But you can see the degree of scattering - it is quite dense, given the distance. In the old video from Syria, a Soviet-designed ""S8"" rocket was most likely used. Almost at the limit of its effective range (4000 meters). But there are new Russian S8 rocket's modification which have an effective range of 6000 meters (versus 4000) and improved accuracy due to prolonged working time of its engine. Also, you can clearly see that the firing angle is not straight too. But the Kamov in Syria had its position at much higher altitude (compared to a how low they usually operate in Ukraine). That's why its angle of aiming no so ""steep"" as we can see in many helicopter footages from Ukraine.

How much damage can these salvos do on the enemy? Against infantry taking position in the trenches or in a hard-walled buildings, probably almost minimal. But a well-protected fortifications are not always available to infantry. We see a lot of videos where Ukrainian troops (including ATGM teams) taking positions in a small forest belts, using only natural shelters, parking a non-armored civilian cars after them. One or more of these NURS-salvos can certainly inflict injuries or losses on them, damage their vehicles and other equipment.",af9242e86b3c976fb642f642713d7604193bae94,True,False,,,,,0,1651413177,,0,{},i6wlfni,False,t3_uftrs7,False,True,t3_uftrs7,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uftrs7/video_shows_russian_ka52_helicopters_working_in/i6wlfni/,1651413191,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651384377.0,

Saddam did try to increase religious influence in the country post 90s with his faith campaign and their were many former Baathist who formed isis I agree. But Saddam was still clearly keeping the state secular (he used to stay that Iraq was a believing but secular nation, which comes from the ideas of a Christian Arab m, Michel aflaq who was the founder of Baathism) and those isis leaders who were former Baathist were only a small portion of the Baathist the rest became the Nashqabandi army (small amounts of Sunni nationalism but still largely Baathist).

3912,[],False,,Jumaai,,Poland,[],,,dark,text,t2_pydto,False,False,"&gt; Not really obvious mate. It objectively proves that it's possible for a helicopter to hit an area target accurately at 5 km with rockets from a moving helicopter, which is exactly what the 
 &gt; Russians are doing. And at least the US has been training on this technique since the 90's. It's effective and accurate, that's kind of the point of the term effective range.

I agree that you can accurately deploy unguided rockets at long distances, that's obviously correct. 

I'm disagreeing with how it's done on the ukrainian battlefield. It's done without any computer assist, such as CCRP, so we know it's done by either some pre-calculations the pilot has to execute perfectly, or it's done by instinct. With how it's performed, on all the videos we've seen, we see that execution is sloppy, such as firing mid swing, ending the barrage hundreds of meters from it's start and at a different angle, or in this video firing one salvo at the enemy and the second somewhere to the side and hundreds of meters away from the initial target. In one of the first videos of a Ka-52 and a Mi-28 doing this in a pair we've seen  that the first helicopter fired its rockets at a completely different postcode than the second, with different angle, launch point differing by at least 100m and different altitude.

If you give me footage of a helicopter in level flight, at a single speed, where it fires off a salvo precisely, I will concede that it was probably accurate. I've seen training grounds footage of that proper execution and it still hit a target measured by hectare. At that point using a single Grad would be cheaper and would deploy more ordnance on target, considering the warheads are 4-5 times bigger than the S-8.

 &gt; Look, I like laughing at the silly Russians as much as the next guy, but this isn't the same as laughing at an ISIS fighter blind shooting a PKM around a wall.

Just yesterday we had footage of a ukrainian Mi-8 doing exactly the same thing, and I'm laughing at them too. I'm not disagreeing with this tactic because the enemy team is doing it, I legitimately think it's a misuse of resources.",0867b1a14faca2d5d6bc40832744ba4d6943703d,True,False,,,,,0,1651412511,,0,{},i6wk5f6,False,t3_uff58w,False,True,t1_i6v7m50,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uff58w/russian_ka52_performing_high_angle_attack_with/i6wk5f6/,1651412526,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651383711.0,

That being said, I still need to point out that the claim you're making regarding shaped charges is not correct.
When a shaped charge explodes to form the penetrator, the [entire process](https://i.imgur.com/ve3hgRN.jpeg) takes around 50 millionth of a second (50 microseconds) from the initiation of the explosive to the full formation of the entire penetrating jet. 

The explosive itself does not transfer much heat to the copper, simply because of the limiting thermal conductivity of the copper, which requires time that just isn't available.
  
The copper does indeed heat up to around 500 degrees Celsius (way below its melting temperature) but this is a result of internal heating from the plastic deformation of the metal - the same way that if you bend a rod of metal quickly, the metal will heat up.   
  

The reason the that the copper acts as a liquid, is due to the local pressures of the jet being in the 10 million psi ballpark, which is hundreds of times above the yield strength of the material. 
 
Because of the massive pressure, the actual hardness of the armor is irrelevant, as both the copper jet and the armor will act as fluids at these pressures, and therefore the way the interaction is modelled is by using [models](https://i.imgur.com/9DW9trg.jpeg) from fluid mechanics. 
This interaction in the model is what produces the [effect you describe](https://i.imgur.com/Y6ILZeh.jpeg), where the copper appears to have bonded with the armor.  

The copper lining inside the cavity is the back-spray of the jet as it exits back out of the entry hole - at least until the hole penetrates entirely through the armour (after which it instead sprays the inside inside of the target with the copper particles).

If the metal at any point had gone past its melting temperature, then the resulting change in its crystalline structure would be detectable, but this is just not the case. This has been demonstrated in many studies, such as [this](https://i.imgur.com/j0V4epl.jpeg)among others is generally quite well understood, partly due to how much funding goes into any scientific work that had military applications. 
  
The misconception that melting or temperature in general for that matter is somehow part of the principle of penetration is however very common - I suspect due to the acronym H.E.A.T. 
  
It is however a misconception as the process is guided by the laws of conservation of momentum and thereby entirely a kinetic process. 

Shaped charges can also be made with the water (in a gel form) as the liner, or nearly any other material - with various degrees of effectiveness. The main reason metals like copper, silver and zirconium are used are due to their plastic ""cohesive properties"" that make them less likely to split into separate chunks when the jet is formed, as this lowers the pressure of the jet against the armour significantly.",f00e3f2ffdf49fedc960096c819ea8f23352f24a,True,False,,,,,0,1651412063,,0,{},i6wjba1,False,t3_ueko8f,False,True,t1_i6rclj2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ueko8f/2_russian_bmps_were_destroyed_by_drone_dropped/i6wjba1/,1651412076,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651383263.0,

1. No footage shows this happening. We have several clips where you have view of the HUD, both screens inside the cockpit, etc. In all of them when the nose goes up this high the rocket pipper stops calculating.

2. Even if they were able to mark a target, when you're at low altitude all far away targets ""stack up"" from your point of view. Trying to pick a spot 5km away instead of 6km or 4km is the difference of a fraction between the top and the bottom of the pipper at this altitude.

(I have read of commanders installing barrage fire behind their lines and holding their artillery officers personally responsible if they did not fire it in the case of unauthorized withdrawal. Not to speak of disciplinary battalions, shootings and hangings.)

There was also a huge element of nihilism in many of the German men who had fought in WWI and provided the senior leadership of WWII. If I had to oversimplify it to one point, I think that what they really, deep down, wanted was their dead of WWI back. Or failing that to be buried in marked graves. (An emotion echoed by the women who had lost so many of the men they had loved so deeply.) Failing that, to fill substitute trenches with designated enemies (the “Holocaust by bullets”) because they could not forgive themselves for having survived, so they had to turn that shame and guilt on someone, anyone else.

The thing I took issue with was taking pleasure in someone dying because you have categorises them as a murderer. If you wake up in the morning looking forward to hearing about people being killed,  I think you forfeit the right to despise people who actually kill. 
Murdering someone for being a murderer just strikes me as ethically and logically incoherent. Particularly when a lot of the targets in these videos are logistics and supply teams made up of conscripts. 

I doubt OP was cheering on the deaths of US/European forces in Iraq. This isn't about sovereignty or an absolute intolerance for murder, it's about justifying the act and enjoyment of murder.

It's crazy how many videos there are of tanks moving into towns unsupported by infantry and getting ambushed.  There is no reason why that should be happening.

Infantry should be out front flushing out ambushes, with the tanks rolling in behind and offering up support with their big guns.  They are still weak against modern AT equipment, but they shouldn't be getting in free ambushes.  Ukrainians should have to expose themselves to infantry or need to sneak around to get at the tanks.

You need to dilute them at each intersection and extend the supply lines. After this you strike at the opportunistic locations and repeat the cycle again. Evantually the spearheads are somewhat worn out and their forces are not concentrated, then movement can be stopped. 

Essentially this stopping location should be something defendable, like river or village. In that sence the terrain is favourable to offensive operations as there are well defined positions where you could expect stiffer resistance and plan accordingly.

In the battlefield problems come from the dynamic situations. For example Ukrainean troops are pushing very dangerously from Kherson region.

Like mud, frost, driving a tank over it. They basically destroy the rifles and see if they can still fire and obviously the new models with a lot of fine tech in them can't handle any of that. I mean, that's the point of new rifles they are made to be more precise. The government then combined all the weapons companies and decided to replace the AK with and AK. They had announced the AK-12 and wanted to make it. Now there was no competition so they were just making a rifle and making it the military rifle. No matter how it turned out it would be the military rifle. Basically not changing anything much, but adding a few things to make it modern just to use the AK-12 name and get money into the right pockets. Which went wrong as the old rifle is not built for a modern military so they just made it worse. You can't lazily update an outdated weapon.

That goes for not just Isis or Al-quaeda but every stripe of religious fundamentalist. They regularly blew up markets and mosques or even planted bombs next to civilian houses, the «insurgents» committed war crimes daily during the entire conflict, Abu Grahib was terrible but compared to what the Iraqis themselves do in their own prisons even today as a matter of routine Abu Grahib was like a college hazing. «Countless» other cases, pure fiction the American military has and still do focus on minimum collateral damage, developing weapons specifically to avoid that. But accidents do happen in the fog of war especially when your «heroic» insurgents use civilians as shields and hide among them an actual war crime.

I was no fan of the democracy idea for Iraq that cost too many lives and took too long the better option would have been to replace Saddam with a puppet and have him tranform the society over a genration if possible. But that is not something western armies can do anymore instead we pretended that everyone is the same and want the same things.

Its funny how you make the assumption that if the Americans committ a crime it instantly creates a wave of new terrorists yet you do not seem to afford the same outcome when the Terrorists themselves committ acts like that routinely with even greater savagery.

I don’t afford dictators any rights, anyone has the moral right for any reason to depose a dictator anywhere, if you do not agree with that you basically approve of any future dictator you yourself and your family might suffer under. Had I been living under Saddam I would have welcomed the Americans and helped the defeat his criminal gang that decided to start an insurgency after their incompetent military was defeated on a walkover. And many Iraqis did do just that.

The regimes in the middle east would not be replaced by some moderate peaceloving people if they fell maybe with the exception of Iran where the Regime is hated by especially the young. But would be replaced by even more regressive forces. America has a focus on maintaining stability still and the region is still in the middle of the great powers fight, the alternatives for the region is China or Russia, two countries that give an absolute rats arse about the human rights even of their own people.

The combat with Goliath was re-worked into the story of David in 1 Samuel 17,[3] but crediting Goliath's death to David instead of Elhanan created a problem.[4] The 4th century BC Book of Chronicles resolved it by describing how ""Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite"" (1 Chronicles 20:5), constructing the name Lahmi from the last portion of the word ""Bethlehemite"" (""beit-ha’lahmi),[4] the King James Bible by modifying 2 Samuel 21:18–19 to make it read as if Elhanan had slain Goliath's brother (""And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare–oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam""), although the Hebrew makes no mention of the word ""brother"", and the Targum, a translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Aramaic, identified Elhanan with David as both were from Bethlehem (targum 2 Samuel 21:19), although this creates yet another problem in that Elhanan is listed as one of David's followers and the killings occur in different places.[5]]",cb804085cd738fe463ed79e3f5709efdff120781,True,False,,,,,0,1651404193,,0,{},i6w7334,False,t3_uflso1,False,True,t1_i6vpmzu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uflso1/another_downed_russian_ka52_with_ukrainian/i6w7334/,1651404205,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651375393.0,

What you guys are calling “tossing rockets” is actually firing technique known as indirect fire, which is a well-established engagement technique used by probably every armed helicopter that has &amp; can carry rockets. We used the technique in the AH-1F Cobra and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior that I flew, can be used by the Apache, and more than likely a capability of every other armed rocket-carrying helicopter in service today. One thing I didn’t see mentioned is the type of warhead you were simulating ~ indirect fire is an “area fire” method that would be delivering similar results to an artillery barrage, albeit on a smaller scale. For these type of engagements, the warhead of choice would be a MPSM type warhead, basically a mini “cluster bomb” type warhead designed to deliver multiple submunitions over a wide area, instead of delivering a single HE burst on a single target. These type of warheads are very effective on exposed troops, supplies, and light-skinned vehicles, which is likely going to be the intended targets when using indirect rocket fire. There are some precision-guided rocket munitions now available- probably in many armed forces’ inventories - but those would likely be used in a direct fire attack on a specific target, not “tossed” a long distance as indirect fire.""

Now, anyone can pretend to be anything online, so there is no way to verify this. Yet, this is a guy claiming to have flown Cobras and Kiowas using essentially this technique.

Again, ""There is no climb, level and dive"". They are using an INDIRECT method. You're describing the direct fire method. Are you touched? 

Frankly, I think you might not have the mental faculties to differentiate between the method of delivery, and the actual delivery itself. US Helicopter pilots train a certain way to deliver indirect rocket fire. We don't know how the Russians train to deliver indirect rocket fire. What they are doing may be absolutely in line with their methodology, but not in line with US methodology. The technique however, of pitching the nose up to fire rockets indirectly? US does it, Russia apparently does it. Looks to me, and apparently people who are familiar with this technique, that that is what the Russians are doing here.",9ac0bf5dc61cf50721ce2c0f3bd0c6360ebe4b9e,True,False,,,,,0,1651402585,,0,{},i6w53yh,False,t3_uftrs7,False,True,t1_i6w4ap7,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uftrs7/video_shows_russian_ka52_helicopters_working_in/i6w53yh/,1651402596,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651373785.0,

We do, clearly visible in the video. Hug the dirt, then fire during pitch up to lob the rockets. There is no climb, level and dive as described in the document you shared, so no, US pilots are not using this technique.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(a) Angular rate error is caused by the motion of the helicopter as the projectile leaves the weapon. It affects most weapon systems. The exceptions are TOW, Hellfire, and Stinger missiles. For example, a pilot using the running-fire delivery technique to engage a target with rockets at 5,000 meters may have to pitch the nose of the helicopter up to place the reticle on the target. When the weapon is fired, the movement of the helicopter imparts an upward motion to the rocket.

Still has nothing to do with what Russians are doing. Just tells pilot to pitch up a bit during firing dive to cover the 5000 meters of range.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, you're describing direct fire method for running fire. The excerpt the guy I linked to from the US handbook described the indirect method.

(a) Angular rate error is caused by the motion of the helicopter as the projectile leaves the weapon. It affects most weapon systems. The exceptions are TOW, Hellfire, and Stinger missiles. For example, a pilot using the running-fire delivery technique to engage a target with rockets at 5,000 meters may have to pitch the nose of the helicopter up to place the reticle on the target. When the weapon is fired, the movement of the helicopter imparts an upward motion to the rocket.

In this video, we see the Russians doing ""Running Fire"". Just before they release the rockets, they pitch the nose up. This is the methodology described in the ""Department of the Army FM 1-140 Helicopter Gunnery, Dated March 1996"", for indirect running fire.

From wiki

Totalitarianism is a form of government and a political system that prohibits all opposition parties, outlaws individual and group opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control and regulation over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of authoritarianism. In totalitarian states, political power is often held by autocrats, such as dictators and absolute monarchs, who employ all-encompassing campaigns in which propaganda is broadcast by state-controlled mass media in order to control the citizenry.[13]

Considering there is no longer even the semblance of a free press and its illegal to say war now, punishable by 15 years, my point stands.

And he DID and does send conscripts. And their parents know it. So no. He does not have to abide by public opinion because the public does not have free press, the right to assembly, or freedom of speech. 

&gt;The Russian Federation doesn't even begin to approach the levels of internal terror and repression that typified those actual totalitarian states.

I'm sure Navalny, everyone else he has killed, and the people arrested for holding a peace of paper would all beg to differ.

Like u/ChrisTosi said, it involves a lot more basic stuff.

And Russia has some serious organisational problems.  
  
Russia decided to deployed battalion tactical groups to the Ukraine. BTGs are nice for localised conflicts because they are rather flexible and you are able to quickly generate a force that looks big.  

However, the BTGs reach their limits in full-scale warfare. Theres is a reason why most bigger countries army is organised into brigades and divisions.  
  
The first issue is coordination. From what I read, in the Ukraine roughly 15 to 20 BTGs are led by one HQ. But there was little to no evidence that was Russia operating a brigade level hq to coordinate between the central command and the different BTG ""sections"".  
I guess with the new phase in the conflict this was probalby at least tried to address, but I doubt the issue is completely solved.  
The problem with this is that When commanders are leading too many elements of a force at the same time, they get easily overwhelmed and become unable to coordinate operations effectively. It is very evident, that this happened to the Russian military in Ukraine.  
  
This is a problem support troops as well. Basically several AA batteries from different units are not the equivalent of an air defence battalion, even if it's the same number of batteries. The battalion command structure enables the coordination of firing sectors with other deployed forces. Without such coordination, ground units cannot identify friendly aircraft, and vice versa. As a consequence, aircraft cannot effectively engage in close air support operations because there is a high risk misidentifying and destroying friendly units – especially if the both sides are using the same military systems. Equally, AA units are reluctant to engage targets because they cannot differentiate between friend and foe.",1c3baf6b404808ec400c43fbf7f7f17f0c03e3d8,True,False,,,,,0,1651397537,,0,{},i6vzh3n,False,t3_uflso1,False,True,t1_i6uoeb5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uflso1/another_downed_russian_ka52_with_ukrainian/i6vzh3n/,1651397552,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651368737.0,

But nevertheless they are stabilized in flight. their engines has a long enough operation time after launch. We can see how at a range of 3800 meters the scattering of salvo launch is comparable to the BM-21 and even better. Visual demonstration in this video's end: https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tgl0s4/allegedly_newly_released_footage_of_a_russian/ (skip until 1:07 time mark)
Yes, the missiles did not reach a bit (it looks like an unlucky salvo). But you can see the degree of scattering - it is quite dense, given the distance. In the old video from Syria, a Soviet-designed NURS ""S8"" rocket was most likely used. Almost at the limit of its effective range (4000 meters). But there are new Russian S8 rocket's modification which have an effective range of 6,000 meters (versus 4000) and improved accuracy. Also, you can clearly see that the firing angle is not straight too. But the Kamov in Syria had its position at much higher altitude (compared to a how low they usually operate in Ukraine). That's why its angle of aiming no so ""steep"" as we can see in a footages from Ukraine.

Ukraine hasn't received a single tank or artillery howitzer prior to Russian invasion. They are fighting with Soviet leftovers from 1970's. 

Not a single one of their fighter planes or long range anti-air missiles is younger than 1991, because that's when they got their airforce from USSR fall and they haven't received a single new fighter aircraft since then. Meanwhile Russia has (*supposedly*) modern planes there are just 3 years old......and yet Ukrainians and wrecking her ass with technology and planes 30 years older than their enemy.

Or maybe Russian army is just shit and weak and cant defeat enemy with outdated weapons? The technology disparity between Ukrainian weapons and Russian ones is as large as it was between Iraq and Americans in 1991.

I know you probably didn't mean it, but for the sake of clarity: it's not an inherent feature of autoloaders, just Russian autoloaders, due to:

&gt;Ammo is stored in the turret unlike the Abrams tank that has it's ammo behind blast proof compartment, but doesn't have an autoloader.

The ammo is stored on the hull floor in the carousel, under the turret. The thinking behind it is good: the majority of hits on tanks by traditional threats is scored on turret or upper hull. Storing the ammunition on the floor means it's less likely to get hit by traditional ATGM's or other tanks. The problem is that while the carousel is a small target from the front, it's massive when attacking from the top. The problem is compounded by the Russian shells using two part ammunition, and the propellant casing is extremely inflammable.

And the Abrams has it's ammo in the turret - the ammo compartment is still a part of the turret.",42a1d3002edcb38e30f8bb67d4384d4fdcaf138c,True,False,,,,,0,1651395705,,0,{},i6vxg4w,False,t3_uffsxk,False,True,t1_i6tting,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uffsxk/russian_tank_fires_on_a_building_in_mariupol/i6vxg4w/,1651395717,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651366905.0,

Russia certainly lacks the ability to project power beyond their immediate border region anyways. So, smuggling weapons to some other area on the globe would be difficult at best.

It's possible they may use proxies in that case. IE, feed the weapons to a third party non-state actor that can smuggle the weapons through established lines.

That bundled with the recent statement that current Russian cruise missile strikes are matching an all time high from march (~50 a day) indicate a possibility that production has increased.

We heard news early on that at least one of Russia tank production facilities stopped production due to lack of components. Is there anything recent about what's going on there? I highly doubt Russia is just sitting on there thumbs and going ""well, shucks guess we have to make do with our reserves"".

You've got a wildly inaccurate view of what is happening. Ukraine is getting their licks in, but they are also taking an absolute beating as well.

There isn't a lot of information out there about relative casualty rates. However, the last like for like comparison we have that I am aware of is from March 6thish. When US/NATO sources estimated Russian KIA at 3-6k, and Ukrainian KIA at 2-4k. Since then, there have been no recent estimates on Ukrainian KIA. 

We also need to be aware that Russia invaded with what is essentially an expeditionary force. IF Ukraine, and it's highly, highly, HIGHLY improbable that they would, step foot in Russia. This would give Putin all the ammunition he needed to declare mobilization, and then you'd see millions of Russians come down on Ukraine, not just 160-200k.

This whole scenario is pure fantasy though. Ukraine simply does not have the heavy weapons to take the fight to Russia in large scale maneuver warfare.

Chechnya waged a war of independence in the early 1990's. That war was the 1st Chechen war. It ended in stalemate. Chechnya remained de-facto independent. 

Between the outbreak of the 1st Chechen war, and the 2nd, Salafists began to take over the separatist movement. Google Salafism. The slightly less religious majority in Chechnya made a deal with Russia, because they didn't want Salafists to take over. The deal they made was to switch sides, in exchange for virtual autonomy. Moscow agreed to this deal. The more moderate factions switched sides.

The official government of the separatists was the ""Republic of Ichkeria"". In 2006, I think, the then sitting president of Ichkeria, a religious lunatic, declared the dissolution of the Republic of Ichkeria, and the establishment of the Caucasus Califate with himself as Emir. Those were the people the moderates, who eventually became the Kadyrov faction, switched sides to fight against. Over the next 5-6 or so years, literally the ENTIRETY of the Caucasus region waged war against the Caucasus Emirate. Georgia, Azerbaijan, Chechnya, Dagestan and the list goes on. 

The Russian Federation and its allies eventially more or less defeated the Salafist jihadis, and many of the survivors fled to Syria and Iraq, where they arrived just in time to join the emerging ISIS.

The TLDR version is, the moderate factions within the Chechen separatist movement, switched sides to fight a precursor to ISIS.

Chechnya now enjoys virtual autonomy. When I say virtual, I mean, they are basically independent in all but name. It is, of course, an incredibly regressive and conservative republic. However, in this case, the Kadyrov mob was truly the lesser of two evils, and Chechnya basically got to have their cake and eat it too. They get to set their own laws, govern their republic how they like, while staying part of the larger economic umbrella of the Russian federation. That doesn't mean there isn't dissent. However, they are not exactly a puppet, and they didn't exactly ""betray"" the ""real"" chechens. They were the majority, and they rejected a Salafist attempted Califate.",fffedd7cda0967f3350a6b1199ce999b675d34e8,True,False,,,,,0,1651391469,,0,{},i6vslnh,False,t3_ufgrhl,False,True,t1_i6tr5w5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufgrhl/chechens_of_the_rosgvardiya_shouting_we_will_have/i6vslnh/,1651391480,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651362669.0,

Ukraine spend 8 years preparing for this war and especially under poroshenko they did a lot to become one of the better armies in europe. They actually did have tons of weapons, a lot soviet era weapons. Of course not comparable witht he assets of russia but still.   


Now days people forget why everyone actually thought ukraine would surrender in 2 days, it wasn't because everyone thought the russian army would steamroll ukraine. People thought this because most people in ukraine were already fed up with war, didn't expect their army to actually stand up to russia and were convinced NATO wouldn't do anything.   


And russia fucked this up so much its quite sad too, they did everything worse than even possible imaginable. I mean they could of captured Zelensky before they delcared war, its not like it was hard for russians to enter kiev. If they only entered donbas from the start and from the south until kherson and mariupol, the war would of looked a lot different. Especially if they just rolled into the donbas and forced ukraine to be the ""agressor"" and made it look that way with propaganda. 

They didn't need to steamroll ukraine, they didn't even need to be superior to ukraine. They just actually needed to understand the situation in ukraine better and realize that ukraine was prepared for this full out invasion. 

Kiev was a horrible idea to attack and this isn't even in hindsight, I said it on the second or third day of war on this account.

**the two concrete pieces of evidence attesting her as a child at the time of her marriage and explicitly stating her age at six during the marriage and nine during the consummation are those two hadiths:**  
  
**""Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me.**  
  
**-Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151**  
  
**""Narrated 'Aishah said: ""The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls.""**  
  
**-Sunan an-Nasa'i 4:26:3380**  
  
**The first hadith comes from al-Bukhari's Sahih al-Bukhari, and al Nasa'i's Sunan al-Sughara, the former written in 870 AD and the latter in 915 AD.**  
  
**Most are quick to cite those two hadiths as ""evidence"" for Aisha being a child bride and Muhammad being a ""paedophile"" but those hadiths don't even have a grain of truth or any legitimacy to be used in counter arguments. Why? The obvious presence of contradicting historical information. And lots of it.**  
  
**The age difference between Aisha and her half-sister Asma: Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq had three daughters. The eldest of them was Asma bint Abu Bakr. Born in 595 AD, scholarly evidence shows us that she was precisely ten years older than her younger half-sister Aisha:**  
  
**-""Asma was 17th person who became Muslim and she was ten years older than her sister, Aisha. She passed away ten days after death of her son while she was 100 years old and all of her teeth were healthy. It was in the year 73 AH (692 AD)""**  
  
**- Ali al-Qari's ""Mirqat al-Mafatih: Sharh Meshkat al-Masabih""**  
  
**-""\[Asma\] was Aisha's sister from her father. And as Ibn Abi-al-Zinad tells us: She was ten years older than Aisha""**  
  
**- Ibn Asakir - ""Tarikh Madinat Dimashq""**  
  
**With Asma being ten years older than Aisha, that means Aisha was born in 605-604 AD. Muhammad and Aisha were married at either 622 (8 months after Hijra) or 624 (after the Battle of Badr) this means Aisha was either 17/18 or 19/20 during the time of her marriage.**  
  
**2. Ibn Ishaq's ""Sirat Rasul Allah"": Hagiographer and historian Ibn Ishaq'sbiography of Muhammad ""Sirat Rasul Allah"" includes a list of the namesof all who accepted Islam in its first year of declaration (610 AD), and thislist includes a mention of ""Abu Bakr's little girl Aisha"". If we are tobelieve that Aisha was truly 6 in either 622 or 624 AD, she wouldn't haveeven been born in 610 AD. This piece of evidence isn't as conclusive anddecisive as Asma's age, but it further confirms it by stating how Aishawas a ""little girl"" in 610 AD which is in line with her birthday being 605-604 AD according to calculations based on Asma's age.**  
  
**3. Aisha's memories in Mecca: Aisha was reported as saying ""I was a girlplaying games when the verse, ""indeed, the Last Hour is their appointedtime, and the Last Hour will be more grievous and morebitter' wasrevealed to God's Messenger"". The verse in question is verse 46 of Suratal-Qamar. This certain surah was revealed as a whole when Muhammadwas staying in Ibn Arqam's house either in 614 or in 618-619. Again, ifAisha was six years old in either 622 or 624 AD, she either wouldn't haveBut.. she appears to have been old enough to remember the event andrecite it later in her life, which again, debunks the claim that she was 6during her marriage to Muhammad.**  
  
  
  
**4. Aisha's most believable death date: Mystery shrouds not only Aisha's date of birth, but also her date of death. But her most believable date of death is in 678 AD where she is reported at dying at the age of 74.Records of her death occurring in this year give a lot of detailedinformation: Her death occurring on Wednesday 17th of Ramadan, theattendants of her funeral and the head of its procession, her burial atJannat al-Baqi according to her wishes, and the manner of her loweringto the grave by her nephews.**  
  
**More simple math: 678-74=604 AD (her birth year according to Asma's age).. thus: 622-604/605= 18/17 and 624-604/605 = 20/19.**

You can give a trained infantryman a new rifle, a trained artilleryman a new gun, and with some crash training they will be effective with them. 

The problem are the machines themselves, Russia isn't too good at building modern stuff in large numbers.

 Soviet military doctrine dictated having large strategic reserves of trained conscripts, tanks, artillery, trucks, armored vehicles and small arms. If you have those, you have all of the basics you need for making new motor-rifle brigades out of thin air with a little patching and reorganisation. Not to mention their Soviet legacy industry, which is pretty good at making these things. They won't have a problem replacing mechanical stuff.

Not really obvious mate. It objectively proves that it's possible for a helicopter to hit an area target accurately at 5 km with rockets from a moving helicopter, which is exactly what the Russians are doing. And at least the US has been training on this technique since the 90's. It's effective and accurate, that's kind of the point of the term effective range.  

Look, I like laughing at the silly Russians as much as the next guy, but this isn't the same as laughing at an ISIS fighter blind shooting a PKM around a wall. This is becoming more about whether or not releasing unguided munitions at their max effective range is useful to the Russian military.

UA Economics Ministry is promising to solve the deficit by end of next week though, and hopefully, it won't be a major hurdle for UAF. They seem to be pretty close to spoiling the Izyum push by retaking area in the Kharkiv region, which would set conditions for a Kupyansk push and force Russians to pull their already lacking force to secure the frontline.

They might also do well to buy Starstreaks/Martlets from the UK given their experience with Russian helicopters/Su-25s. These are still in production and I'm sure the UK would appreciate new customers to extend the production lifespan of those missiles, and likely to give Ukraine a good deal. They're also pretty future-proof.

Ukraine also demonstrably needs anti-ship missiles. India's Brahmin missile is insanely fast and has a 500 mile range, but they're not the friendliest towards Ukraine right now and Ukraine would probably prefer a Western supplier. Harpoon is obsolete... if they could persuade the US to provide even a battery of their stealthy LRASMs that would go a long way as a deterrent.

F16s. Loads of countries selling them as they upgrade to F35s, still extremely capable aircraft.

NLAWs are cheap and have demonstrated effectiveness, although Javelins are such a meme at this point they might well go with them.

Artillery they'd probably want to stick with the M777 howitzer. Self propelled guns are probably too expensive, they'd likely rather have numbers over mobility.

IVFs probably Bradleys, although it depends on the lay of the land when the war is over. They'll probably want more of what they have plenty of already. No need to buy the most expensive kit, just stuff that works. Bradleys come with a certain future-proofness to them; there are loads of them built already and the US wants to give them APS which Ukraine will probably want as Russia fits its own vehicles with APS.

Tanks, probably not bother. Ukraine already has a lot, and they're expensive and have a large supply footprint. Tanks have not done well in this war.

Probably some more Bayraktars, as well as developing their own independent UAV. 

Switchblade drones or their own, independently developed loitering munitions. Ukraine is likely to go big on loitering munitions as they are cheap and extremely effective.

&gt;Let’s talk about the two different methods of communications with datalinks and sharing information. Link 16, which is the NATO standard, both in 4th gen and 5th gen, is like a big lighthouse – and you broadcast your information everywhere, to everyone on the network. It’s omnidirectional, so it’s everywhere. And anyone can pick up that signal. If you’re transmitting as a part of a datalink network, you can be found, because you are an emitting source. That’s the first problem.

&gt;And the second problem is, there really is not a lot of sophisticated data that goes across on Link 16. It is essentially the position data, some elements of what weapons you are carrying and how much fuel you have, and some communications information that goes in the back and forth. B**ut the F-35, and F-22, (each with a different format), the datalinks are designed as low probability of intercept stealthy networks. They are not omnidirectional, but instead uniquely directed on to those aircraft in the network, communicating with each other. Packets of data are sent directly back and forth but not in a continuous stream of data as in Link 16. Intercepting that data would be cosmically difficult to do and that’s how it remains stealthy.**",aa6a2a21d48dd3d364f7abcda418bef7f95d57fb,True,False,,,,,0,1651373240,,0,{},i6v31yj,False,t3_uf4jw5,False,True,t1_i6ugz52,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uf4jw5/ukrainian_helicopter_flying_at_very_low_altittude/i6v31yj/,1651373259,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651344440.0,

As far as I've read, the T-90 isn't much of an improvement on previous designs.  Russia even went as far as continuing production of the T-80 series and calling it a superior tank. It seems like the biggest difference between the T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 in performance seems to stem mostly from which level of upgrades the tanks have received and their state of repair, not the actual underlying qualities of the tank itself.

The newest Russian tank (T-14) seems unlikely to get into serious production in the near future, between sanctions, a poor economy, price, etc.. The t-90 was designed to be cheap.  Russia will likely have to rebuild their tank formations with T-90's

Ukraine has a tank plant of their own, which is why they've stuck with older Soviet designs. They're fairly cheap and they don't have to re-train everyone. They're already operating 4 types of tanks T-64, T-72, T-80, and T-90 without even getting into the different variants of each that they have. They don't have the money to compete with massive Russian tank formations using expensive western tank designs. Maybe they might come out with a domestic design based on some type of hybrid of their current tank production with more western compatibility and existing frames.  We'll have to wait and see what they do at the end of the war.",4bb67ac9f967df46764ef273fdc5a898ea421d35,True,False,,,,,0,1651372289,,0,{},i6v1day,False,t3_ufo4nj,False,True,t1_i6uuzfz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ufo4nj/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_5122/i6v1day/,1651372299,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651343489.0,

Chapter 7 Section 1: Page 125

&gt;7-1. TYPES OF FIRE
The two types of fire are direct and indirect. FM 101-5-1 defines direct and indirect fire as
follows:


&gt;a. Direct fire is ""fire directed at a target that is visible to the aimer or firing unit.""


&gt;b. Indirect fire is ""fire delivered on a target which cannot be seen by the firing unit.""


The document further describes firing modes of unguided rockets:

&gt;b. Running Fire. Running fire is an engagement from a moving helicopter above ETL.
Both direct and indirect fires can be delivered during running fire. The forward airspeed
adds stability to the helicopter and increases the delivery accuracy of weapon systems,
particularly rockets.

Previously in the manual, Chapter 4, Section 1, Page 55, this excerpt is found:

&gt;(a) Angular rate error is caused by the motion of the helicopter as the
projectile leaves the weapon. It affects most weapon systems. The exceptions
are TOW, Hellfire, and Stinger missiles. For example, a pilot using the
running-fire delivery technique to engage a target with rockets at 5,000 meters
may have to pitch the nose of the helicopter up to place the reticle on the
target. When the weapon is fired, the movement of the helicopter imparts an
upward motion to the rocket.

""Running-fire delivery technique"" that requires the pilot to ""pitch up the nose of the helicopter to place the reticle on the target"" that is capable of indirect fire at 5000m (3.2 miles) sounds exactly like what the Russians are doing here. I can't read Russian, so I'm using Army Field Manuals that I am familiar with, but it shows that the US trains for this technique. Unless you're a combat pilot, I don't care about your credentials. There's way more in that document that shows all the standards US pilots have to demonstrate annually, in day and night time operations. When I was in the military with an Artillery unit, we had to shoot similar tables, and where judged the exact same way. This usage of tables is a service wide standard that all combat units have to demonstrate proficiency on every year.",449902b0bacd4036acd194eb692b7cba7fcf743e,True,False,,,,,0,1651369305,,0,{},i6uvxed,False,t3_uff58w,False,True,t1_i6ussbg,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uff58w/russian_ka52_performing_high_angle_attack_with/i6uvxed/,1651369319,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651340505.0,

Every single one was a terrorist.

They blew up subway trains, apartment highrises, took hostage an elementary school and and a theater. Dudaev, one of their leaders, took a hospital hostage and literally put up sick people in windows as human shields, there is footage of this on youtube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBBUZJs5m4Q&amp;ab_channel=APArchive

the ""Dudaev Batalion"" in ukraine is named after him.

They openly stated that terrorism was their main weapon and they terrorized the civilian population of Chechnya and the nearby regions of Ingushetia and Dagestan aswell.

in 1999 they got up to about 45-60 thousand in strength, a small fucking army. the seige of Grozny was fighting that army within city limits. Btw more then half of these terrorist were not ethnically chechen but muslims from other countires.

 just like al-Qaida in afghanistan, they was sponsored and given weapons by CIA, and later turned more extreme and fell out of the control even of CIA. 

here is Putins speech talking about how CIA answered Russia, when  Russia caught their contacts on video/photo(back in 1996) and asked why are you sponsiring people to commit terrorist attacks in russia

https://www.russiamatters.org/node/20317

After the separatist were defeated some of them that survived went to afghanistan/uzbekistan/turkey and the middle east were they joined up the local radical islam groups.

Russia tried to track a lot of these people and reported them as ""terrorist threats"" to interpol, but because of politics some of these individuals were labeled as ""freedom fighters"" in US, not unlike the freedom fighters in Syria that quickly joined forces with ISIS.

The guy that shot up the Istanbul airport with a couple buddies in 2011? the guy who drove the truck into the crowd in Paris, the 18 year old that stabbed people in germany a couple years ago, All 3 of those were linked to chechen terrorist groups by Russia, and the right warnings were sent to interpol and other security organizations but were completely ignored by the west.

After the truck ramming the crowd in France the french started to listen way more.

- let’s assume that covering most of the surface of the craft with sensors is impractical, or at least ineffective. This assumption may not be true, but let’s say it is
- as a consequence of the above, you instead placed cameras at strategic locations around the helicopter so that they can look for IR laser hits over wide sections of the craft
- those cameras will see the circular illumination and also see the extent to which that circle ⭕️ is distorted, which after you account for the curvature of the hull itself, will give you the inbound direction of the laser. ie: a perfect circle on a flat surface means that the designator is shining from a perfect 90 degree angle at a flat elevation. All other directions and elevations will elongate the circle, proving you with directionality.
- incorporate that directionality from multiple cameras at once and you can probably get a fairly accurate direction of the targeting laser.

It’s also worth noting that the direction of the targeting laser is not always the direction of the inbound missile or the human targeting you, as is the case with a remotely operated stugna.",8b099aa884922f7140181c2f264c535fe32405f5,True,False,,,,,0,1651366246,,0,{},i6uq8xs,False,t3_uflso1,False,True,t1_i6ukxth,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uflso1/another_downed_russian_ka52_with_ukrainian/i6uq8xs/,1651366263,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651337446.0,

7013,[],False,,amandakayaks,,,[],,,,text,t2_4gndmcxs,False,False,"Also, think about it like this:

The only thing the NLAW has to estimate is the speed of the target - the distance doesn't matter because the missile actually curves its flight path so that it intersects with the point with the correct amount of lead for a perpendicularly travelling target at all of the distances between 20m and 800m. The only thing the NLAW needs to guess at is the speed.

For a target travelling perpendicular to the NLAW operator, the guess will be the most accurate, but because this case also has the most curved flight path, that guess will be the most important, so it needs that accuracy in order to hit.

For a target travelling straight at the NLAW operator, the NLAW will actually be totally unable to guess the vehicle's speed, since it can only track the horizontal motion. But - because the flight path will be perfectly straight that guess doesn't matter at all.

Basically for angles in between those two: the more important that it is for the system to accurately guess the speed of the target, the more suitable the angle will be (closer to perpendicular) to generating a accurate estimate of speed. Conversely, the less suitable the angle is to generating an accurate estimate, the less important it will be for that estimate to be accurate.

It's important to note that the metal detector is just a fuze, responsible for detonating the warhead when the missile is used in OTA mode. In DA mode the metal detector does nothing and a time delayed impact fuze is used instead. The same guidance method is used in both cases. If you're targeting a moving truck at 500m you still want to be able to hit it, but you probably don't want to hit that target in OTA mode since it has no armor that you need to punch through and most of the post-penetration effects of an EFP actually come from shrapnel caused by punching through the armor. So, instead, you would use the DA mode where the missile would do the same curved trajectory to the target but would hit the side of the target directly and then explode a fraction of a second later when it was inside the truck.",631889f0c215d5b2ad20fd1d3d86ddb2f0776ae1,True,False,,,,,0,1651364874,,0,{},i6uno7t,False,t3_uf9gc1,False,True,t1_i6uh4ny,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uf9gc1/sbu_firing_javelin_missiles_at_a_russian_bmd4/i6uno7t/,1651364891,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1651336074.0,

I doubt they can do any damage to the building you speak of.

Obviously you can pre-calculate, that firing that type of rockets at a certain pitch, elevation and velocity, will result in them impacting a certain distance from the point of firing. That requires perfect execution. PERFECT. Fire it 2 degrees off? You've missed the enemy. Fire it 50 meters off? You've missed the enemy. Get your and target elevation wrong? You've missed the enemy. Do it sloppily (like fire mid swing, like it's done in all those videos), you've hit a large oval hundreds of meters in length.

You must be perfect, and they aren't. They are winging it and hoping to hit, not aiming.
