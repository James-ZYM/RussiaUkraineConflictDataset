[],False,,Dardanelles5,True,,,[],,,,text,t2_17k6gu,False,False,"&gt;About the Moskva sinking: while there’s no solid evidence, there’s very strong circumstantial evidence: Ukraine announcing it got hit before Russia announced a ‘fire’ started onboard, Russian naval assets pulling further from the coast out of missile range, attempted strikes at the Neptune missile factory etc. Meanwhile there’s no evidence it was merely a fire.

This is incorrect. The Ukrainians were late to claim this attack, and when they did, it was announced in the clear and on social media which is in itself a red flag. The Moskva was in fact closer to the Romanian coast that it was to the Urkrainian coast which is why 3rd party activity can't be ruled out.

As for hitting the Vizar factory, that isn't proof of anything, it's a military target and they'e been hitting hundreds of targets every day.

The Ukrainians have mobilised all reserves (totalling 900,000). All able bodied men have been conscripted, they've even gone as far as opening the prisons and arming murderers and rapists as well as handing out assault rifles to random citizens in Kiev. The numerical advantage is real, do your own research and you'll see that I'm quite correct.

&gt;As another poster mentioned, the Ukrainian army is nowhere near “state of the art”

Relative to who? The US? Ukraine has one of the most powerful militaries in Europe. They've been receiving top tier weaponry and training for at least the past 8 years and have spec ops trainers embedded within their ranks at all levels. Yavoriv has had a constant rotation of Green Berets training conventional forces and we know that even the SAS are there conducting training even as the war persists.

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"Yes, it seems there is a clear disconnect on several levels.

The article is arguing, among other things, that removing buffer states iterates closer to direct conflict between NATO and Russia.  You think that risk stops once the only remaining type of conflict is direct.  

First, you're assuming the risk of direct conflict stops once buffer states are off the table, because of mutually assured destruction.  That assumption is wrong for the same reason it is wrong to have assumed the cold war would have always remained cold and it couldn't have been any other way.  

It's a mistake to just assume that direct conflict is off the table when Washington prevaricates in the face of Russian aggression. Washington's incoherence and ambiguity is what brought the world to this position in the first instance.  If the threat of an adequate military response was certain --- and not just a bluff like Obama played in Syria --- we wouldn't be here.   

Mutually assured destruction is a theoretical abstraction, not a law of international relations on par with something like Einstein's theory of relativity.  One the one hand, it is true that every gamed-out scenario involving nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia leads to mutually assured destruction, very quickly.  But on the other, each of those scenarios involve *exchanges* as opposed to *unilateral* --- subsequently unanswered --- nuclear engagements.  

One such possible unilateral, potentially unanswered, nuclear engagement is exactly what is on the table now: Russia uses tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine and Biden does nothing in response.  Assume for the sake of argument that the Biden Administration does not engage with Russia directly even if Russia launches tactical nukes against Ukraine.  The message that sends Moscow is that Washington might not risk potential escalation even if Russia uses lower yield nukes, like tactical nuclear weapons because of perceived risk of subsequent escalation. 

Doing so is consistent with Washington's historic failures to address Russian aggression from Georgia in 2008 to present, now extrapolated to tactical nuclear weapon use.  It's hardly difficult to imagine that Putin would assume the same would apply if he used tactical nuclear weapons in other contexts, including direct conflict.  That would likely be a miscalculation on Putin's part, but we won't know until he (or a replacement) is actually confronted with the choice of whether to retaliate and how.  

Second, buffer states are not the sole source of direct conflict mediation; but they still serve that purpose, so removing the remainder iterates closer to direct conflict.  It almost seems like you're thinking Washington and Moscow are just fighting over Ukraine for the sake of fighting over Ukraine, and no other reason.  So, you think the only reason they're fighting about a buffer state is just for the sake of having a fight about a buffer state?  That makes no sense at all.  

The fight over buffer states is about security and strategic access.  That is particularly true, given that: Russia's strength is primarily land-based and main strategic vulnerability is that the unobstructed northern European plain leading directly to Moscow.  Outside of Russia's control, Russia perceives Ukraine as an existential threat.",305491bfe15c63056441bad4fe0b27d9bd6e5245,True,False,,,,,0,1651449189,,0,{},i6yu1gw,True,t3_ug7f75,False,True,t1_i6yjlh4,/r/geopolitics/comments/ug7f75/tragedy_national_insecurity_and_war_in_ukraine/i6yu1gw/,1651449201,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651420389.0

[],False,,AlesseoReo,,,,[],,,,text,t2_xcdegtv,False,False,"I feel like we're missing each other entirely.

To sum it up: I don't see how potential ""removal"" of Ukraine as the last ""neutral"" buffer between the West and Russia makes their relations more tense and dangerous. The only conflicts between Russia and West have been over these very ""neutral"" countries; once such a country becomes member of either block, direct intervention from the other block is extremely unlikely. And hasn't happened in recent history.

I don't think you've adressed ""why"" that would be the case. 

What you've linked talks about already potential NATO/Russia conflict which is just as likely now as once Ukraine's side is decided in this war (and if not, it hasn't been explained anywhere why that would be the case).

&amp;#x200B;

So, back to the topic at hand. I agree that we don't know Putin's tripwire but it is impossible to conduct international policy if you get crippled by the fact that an opponent has nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union had nuclear weapons and also claimed to  have various ""red lines"" and ""tripwires"" over time. Still didn't prevent anyone from competing with them out of fear of their use.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I was talking about the post-war scenarion the whole time which I assumed you did as well since the main point of the article is the ""end of buffer states"" which would imply that the Ukraine war was resolved in any way.

Tactical nukes haven't been used ever so for you to say ""That would set context for further nuclear conflicts"" when the situations would be completely different is odd. Ukraine wouldn't be able to respond to a tactical nuke with anything really, but NATO remains in possession of humanity-destroying amount of nukes just like Russia.",d04760e4c962659e3a0d507d81ad21616ca18d6e,True,False,,,,,0,1651444201,,0,{},i6yjlh4,False,t3_ug7f75,False,True,t1_i6yha18,/r/geopolitics/comments/ug7f75/tragedy_national_insecurity_and_war_in_ukraine/i6yjlh4/,1651444216,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651415401.0
[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"At least three problems with jumping to conclusions like that readily present themselves. 

First, the article doesn't say that a missile attack is the only condition under which Putin would use nuclear weapons or even define what type of ""missile attack"" Putin meant:

&gt; It is unclear if Putin meant that Russia would respond only in the case of nuclear warheads or non-nuclear missiles in general. 

Second, no one has any idea what the actual tripwire would be for Putin.  Nor is it the case that Putin sees himself as bound by past statements or commitments.  The opposite is true, as reflected in nearly every consequential foreign policy decision he has made --- from the Budapest memorandum to present.  

Third, you have limited your consideration to nuclear conflict between the Russia and NATO.  It is unclear whether you are assuming that Russia would not use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear power (i.e., Ukraine) or whether that just hasn't been considered.  If nuclear weapons are used in the current conflict --- and that is a big ""if"" --- the most likely form such use would take, would be Russia using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.  In that case, it's unlikely the United States under current leadership would respond militarily.

Territorial and maritime geostrategic frameworks define the contest for power in Europe.  Ukraine is caught between both. Russia is a territorial power, primarily.  The northern European plain lacks natural barriers to invasion, but create opportunities for both client and buffer states, each that could channel risks of invasion.  For Russia, establishing and/or maintaining client states --- particularly along the Northern European Plain, and possibly from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea --- are strategic imperatives to maintain the balance of power.  NATO has maritime superiority.  The Baltic Sea and Black Sea could likewise be springboards for both commerce and supporting military engagements, whether offensive or defensive.   For NATO, both are extensions of the northern Atlantic ocean.  

Buffer states between Europe's adverse power centers mediate that contest --- and by so doing, mitigate the risk of ""showdown"" wars.   Particularly where the three Baltic states are NATO members, from Moscow's perspective, Ukraine is part of Russia's ""near abroad"" and should remain within its exclusive sphere of influence (or ideally be re-incorporated into the Russian empire).  Yet, Washington has flirted with the idea of Ukraine's membership in NATO since it gained independence and even more so after the USSR's collapse.  This ostensible ""strategic ambiguity"" has created the worst possible outcome in Ukraine: inviting a Russian military response under circumstances where Ukraine has failed to develop a robust military of its own and where Washington failed to live up to implied obligations under the Budapest Memorandum in 1994 (along with the other signatories).  When hostilities end, Ukraine will either be annexed by Russia or become aligned more closely with NATO.  In either world, competition for power on the European continent will become more precarious: concurrently defined by a lack of neutral buffers between NATO and Russia and with greater risk of a showdown war between them.",19d4a7646bf0f70f17d246190901eac7bc7712a7,True,False,,,,,0,1651433513,,0,{},i6xvg1v,True,t3_ug7f75,False,True,t3_ug7f75,/r/geopolitics/comments/ug7f75/tragedy_national_insecurity_and_war_in_ukraine/i6xvg1v/,1651433531,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651404713.0

Fast forward to the Kennedy Administration which was pro India and really came to India's aid during the war with China. US was pro India to the extent that on learning that China was gong to test a nuke they offered India a nuclear device to test, so India became the first country in Asia to do so.   Indian leaders were always concerned of provoking Chinese Army and refused  the offer. When China attacked India, US aid flowed to India and Indians were so grateful, that you would see Kennedy's portrait in shops, cabs and living rooms. Then came the Johnson administration and the 1965 war with Pakistan. The West imposed an arms embargo on India this is where USSR stepped in with Arms.

In 1971, when India intervened to stop a genocide in East Pakistan, Nixon threatened India with a nuclear strike. Nixon also dumped India and moved towards China.

This has a bearing on the present crisis as India understands that they are one election away from being dumped and US making nice with China. 

The result of the 1965 Arms embargo is that most of IAF and Indian navy has Russian weapons. They can't afford to ground them during the tensions with China. 

Also, Biden has a history of being an Anti India senator, while Indians see many US officials as pro India and pro Quad, Biden is not seen as an Indian well wisher. He is seen more like an opportunist, who would over to use Indian against China. 

India and US never formed a relationship as allies, it has jumped from one administration to the next. 

At present India gave up the Chabar port in Iran that it developed as an alternate route to Afghanistan under Trump's pressure. This was done with the understanding that US will stabilize Afghanistan before leaving. Biden messed up India's security by practically gifting it to Pakistan.

[],False,,Kichigai,,,,[],,,,text,t2_31nm3,False,True,"&gt;untrained conscripts that don’t want to be there aren’t useful, and are likely an outright liability.

And may be starving. Videos have surfaced of Ukrainians showing off captured Russian field rations that expired in 2015. Some reporting says they're asking the Chinese for help with that, and Chinese MREs are supposed to be pretty bad. Not just bad, like tastes bad, but the Pork Lo Mein portions included in them may have spoiled after only a year. So almost half the calories in these rations are inedible.

I read something that talked about how field rations are important as a tool for maintaining morale. Nobody expects field rations to be great, but if you can at least make them good, and convenient, with a modicum of luxury, that it can reassure a soldier that somebody is at least *thinking* about them and what they're enduring.

The article pointed out that while there was sugar rationing going on soldiers were getting chocolate bars in their ration packs. It sent a message that they were being prioritized. People at home were doing with less so they could have something nice. It was a snack they could have between meals, or you could barter with it, but it wasn't a strictly bare bones, just the necessities, suck it up thing.

That when your rations suck, and suck hard, it's a sign that either nobody is putting much consideration into them, or doesn't think it's worth the expense for soldiers to have good food, or the country is in such a state that it isn't capable of making good food for those on the front line, none of which is good.

So you're a rural Russian conscript, you're not well informed about what the hell is going on, or even what your mission is, and you're handed a packet of food that you can't even read the instructions on because it's in a different language, and when you open up the heated package everything is green and smells of chlorophyll.

We're hearing reports of logistical problems on the ukrainian side, getting all those weapons to the front is a challenge, so it is questionable how long it would take ukraine from getting a missile to actually using it. The fleet has now been painfully made aware of the thread, so they'll act more cautious. I hope the ukrainians manage to sink more russian ships, but this will take time and needs patience to wait until an opportunity presents itself. Ukraine achieved a great economy of force with its attack on the Moskva, but it needs to keep it that way. That's just how fighting a modern war works as the underdog. Sinking ships is an excellent way of hurting russian geopolitical influence for a long time.
* No, there should be no face-saving way out. As long as the ukrainians want to fight, the war should continue. Russia must lose as many soldiers, equipment and officers as possible, to reduce its capacity for future wars. The current losses of russian hardware and men are the biggest improvement for many countries security since their NATO membership. If the west commits to it I'm confident that Ukraine has a chance of victory and as long as that is the case I want the west to go through with it. Santions should not even be lifted in case of an ukrainian victory. On the contrary, the west should extend those sanctions to countries that are still supporting russia. As long as russia clings to its grand power delusions, peaceful coexistence and trade means arming your enemy. To end those it is absolutely essential that russia has no way to claim victory. To this end, the west needs to do more than just send arms and apply sanctions. At the very least it needs to create credible military threats around russia - Murmansk, Baltics, Kamchatkha, Sakhalin, Vladiwostok, Caucasus, Black Sea, Kaliningrad ... to force russia to keep more forces spread out.
* I hope that other countries see opportunities for themselfes and act on them, but I don't think they will. Georgia is a small country that cannot compede with russia. In the 2008 war russia basically used just one CAA, the 58th, and still won within 12 days. They would have a hard time to assemble such a force right now, but it would still be essentially a very risky gamble for Georgia. I doubt they'll take it. Japan is in a much better position, but it really does not want its military preoccupied in Sakhalin if China attacks Taiwan, so I don't think they'll do anything serious either. The Moldovan active duty military isn't even 10000 soldiers strong. All those countries could, in theory, use the current situation but in reality it will just be too risky to act.

Chinese propaganda is straightforward and easy to spot. Western propaganda on the other hand is sinister and deep. It sneaks up on you without you knowing. 

Brave New World is more apt to describe Americans than Chinese to be honest. Many many people hold the same view but Americans don't know it. They think the hold world supports them. In fact majority of ASEAN countries are pro-china when push comes to shove. Of course, they also try to butter up to both sides and see who will win. But for sure, nobody sees America as the hero in the story. 

And there is this misconception that Chinese people are somehow uninformed just because of the infamous ""Great Firewall Censorship"". That's untrue. Most people in China use VPN and can access facebook or youtube. They also know how to bypass censorship in chinese websites. Its not as amazing as you think. You need to understand chinese culture and actually live there to understand this. Chinese people genuinely support their government for the most part and they also criticize the government ALL THE TIME. Many many chinese are very well educated and have travelled all around the world. 

I find the idea westerners have that CHina is Northkorea 2.0 is incredibly ridiculous. In fact, the more western people I meet that hold such a view, it kinda reinforces the believe that American propaganda is scary. They really make the population dumb. 

Furthermore, every time I try to tell them a different point of view, most of the times I get branded as a bot or some 50 cent army or like a CCP spy or something. Haha.

No, the Western populace shames people for war crimes going on in Ukraine &amp; says if you don't support us your supporting the war crimes in Ukraine. That's not a fear of nuclear weapons, that's moral outrage, &amp; that moral outrage should also exist for Yemen. 

&gt;Additionally, roughly a fifth of the world's crude, wheat, and fertilizer doesn't come out of Yemen. In fact, none of their exports break $1billion. Additionally, we don't get state interference on anywhere near the level from SA as we do Russia (as horrible as SA is). 

Sure .

&gt;That's why the West is paying less attention to the Yemen conflict, because it affects us vastly less than the Ukraine war does.

Because as you noted, in pure moral outrage terms you should care more about the conflict that has a higher death toll which is going to be Yemen.

what's amusing about that? If you really think democracy is superior, then the more exposure those people have to democracy, the more they will lust for it, leading to political change from within.

You're just repeating the exact view that i'm trying to discredit, that democracies are inherently superior and we should treat everyone else with disdain. Moralising in that way is behind untold amounts of bloodshed, because it only leads in one direction - the use of military force to 'impose democracy' on other peoples.

The British put it at 15,000. The Ukrainian put it at 22,800. Where do you get your figure from, you must know something other people don't

The Western figures are heavily based on Ukrainian sources which are completely unreliable. They also don't gel with the advances that the Russians are clearly making. You can't sustain 25-50% unit losses and persist in any effective capacity. Pundits who were reporting the numbers you cite (i.e 25% casualty rate) were saying back at the end of March that the Russians would have to abandon the operation within days because of their casualties. Clearly that is not the case, the Russians are pressing forward and securing objectives every day. They are redeploying units fresh from combat to other parts of Ukraine. Western MSM would have you believe that they are buttressing these units with fresh, untrained conscripts but that is demonstrably false. Russian efficacy has improved dramatically since the campaign's outset, it hasn't waned as these narratives would necessitate. 

As unsavoury as it is for propagandised Westerners, you have to look at the Russian MOD figures and compare them with the current situation. Their figures paint are far more compelling considering the situation on the ground. A middle ground between RMOD and NATO is where I get my estimate.

&gt;The Ukrainian military isn't state-of-the-art, nor are most of their troops well trained and definitely not the strongest in Europe. Could they take on the French or the Turkish military, I doubt it. Before the War, Ukraine's military budget was US$5 Billion a year, France's was US$60 Billion, At the present moment, Ukraine's GDP is US$86 Billion. IF they were strong they wouldn't need all the aid.

Incorrect, Ukraine's military is trained to NATO standards. They are more combat ready than the French and have a far larger army once reservists are accounted for. You can't compare raw military spending, you have to normalise it for currency. Additionally, Ukrainian GDP (an irrelevant figure as we should be using PPP) was 150 billion pre invasion and that's the relevant figure not the current war shattered amount.

&gt;If they have a 1:3 numerical disadvantage why invade in the first place?
