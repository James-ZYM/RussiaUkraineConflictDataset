Inflation would be the primary cause of a recession, causing consumers to pull back spending. That actually would decrease inflation to some extent since it's being driven by supply issues. 

Additionally, lay offs (as we're beginning to see in the tech sector) into a historically tight labor market would also decrease upward wage pressure. Even a 3% increase in unemployment would only push the US to a rate of 6.5%, which is about what it was at the beginning of 2021. 

The biggest drops are coming in the stock market. However, this is more of a correction from overvalued stocks from easy money from the Fed. How much that actually cools demand will have to be seen. 

As for fossil fuels: I don't see it dropping off huge amounts. Probably around $100 a barrel. Oil investors are keeping companies on much tighter leashes this time, fearing a drop off after major investment like the last two times oil was over $100. Also, refineries that needed significant reinvestment were permanently shut down at the beginning of the pandemic and others are struggling to find labor to increase production.

&gt; * Despite its failures in Ukraine, Russia retains the capacity and the will to continue to seriously challenge the United States and Europe. Russia may be down, but it’s not out.

&gt; * …the war in Ukraine has done little to affect Russia’s more destructive military capabilities. It isn’t modernized Soviet tanks or Russia’s dated air force that most concern the United States and NATO; it’s Russia’s submarines, integrated air and missile systems, electronic warfare, antisatellite systems and diverse nuclear arsenal. These capabilities, which have gone almost completely untouched during the war, remain available to the Kremlin.

&gt; * In any case, the Russian military will be spared the full effect of economic contraction. Even in straitened times, the Kremlin has a habit of spending on arms rather than people: We can be sure that it won’t be the military budget that Mr. Putin cuts first.

&gt; * …Russia’s defense industry has spent years adapting and finding ways to work around sanctions.

&gt; * Yet many regionally significant countries, such as India and South Africa, have longstanding ties to Russia that they are not currently prepared to abandon. Other countries, worried that economic sanctions will raise the cost of living and create instability within their borders, are refusing to pick sides. African countries, for example, have not imposed any sanctions on Russia, and the Middle East is hedging. And, of course, Russia can count on the continued support of China.

&gt; * In Russia, there’s no reason to believe Mr. Putin’s regime is under immediate threat. 

&gt; * In other words: Russia is a problem for the West, and it’s not going anywhere.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"Because an unbiased perspective would unpack the hidden assumptions of the framework the Russians rely on for justifying their behavior in these situations. She refers to Putin's perception that the West ignores Russia's ""geopolitical concerns"" but does not seek to define or clarify those concerns. Instead, she assumes that the west must either accept those concerns at face value or fight violently against them. 

That is inherently a pro-Russian perspective, because it tacitly accepts the realpolitik, spheres-of-influence, Cold War era thinking about how international relations should work which underlies the Russian perspective. During the Cold War, international relations were largely organized around the balance of power between the USSR and NATO (along with their various allies and proxies). But that was because they were two closely matched power blocs, so realist policy making demanded a certain deference to the Soviets within their own sphere of influence. That deference was based on assessments of the balance of power and the dangers of escalation, not on any principled stance about the rights of sovereign nations. In fact, the rights of sovereign nations were quite frequently ignored by both sides when it suited their purposes to do so, despite both Soviet and Western claims to care about the self-determination of the nations they used as pawns in their great power competition. 

Meaning, we lived under a realist global order during the Cold War, but after it we moved into an era where a principles- and law- based international order started to take hold with the growing importance of international bodies like the WTO and ICJ, and a growing body of international law designed to enable peaceful trade between nations. Respect for sovereignty of other nations started to become more important than spheres of influence realpolitik because the international order converged on a less coercive and more peaceful set of standards for conflict resolution. e.g., there's no need for the US to fight a war in China to keep China open to international trade with capitalist countries since China has decided to integrate with the global economy in a manner largely consistent with liberal trade laws despite remaining nominally communist and authoritarian. Instead we use the WTO, free trade agreements, and similar tools for peaceful economic competition. 

Putin wants to drag the world back into the era of unprincipled, purely realist, balance of power international relations. He believes he has the power to impose his will on Ukraine, and therefore that he has the right to do so. He believes Russia is a great power and that great powers have a right to control their spheres of influence arbitrarily for their own interests, and to use escalation to protect those spheres of influence. Potentially including actual nuclear escalation but certainly including the threat of such escalation. 

And this is why it's worth unpacking all these assumptions: they do not even make internal sense, never mind enough sense to justify altering Western approaches to managing Russian aggression. Under an idealist approach, there is no governing principle that would authorize Russian interference in the internal decisions of any other sovereign nation, even if Russia is a great power with a sphere of influence. Under a realist analysis, Russia is not a great power and does not have the ability to impose its will on Ukraine, and therefore it doesn't have a sphere of influence there that anyone else need respect. Putin wants to live in a world where might makes right, but he doesn't have any might. His difficulty is in accepting that reality. The West's difficulty is in encouraging him to accept that reality, or in encouraging Russian society at large to accept that reality and replace Putin if he proves unwilling to do so.

At its heart, the Russian perspective is a disingenuous effort to conflate realism with idealism. They want to imbue their ruthless, unprincipled geopolitics with an aura of moral justification, by framing the west as the aggressor for violating their self-proclaimed sphere of influence. But spheres of influence are realpolitik. They are a recognition that principles can't trump military force, and sometimes its not worth fighting for principles when the human cost would be too great. Spheres of influence are not morally self-justifying in the same way self-determination and sovereignty are. So the only thing that can justify a sphere of influence is the power to impose a sphere of influence. Russia clearly lacks that power and is unwilling to face facts, but its propagandists want to pretend spheres of influence are an idealistic, principles-based justification for the war in order to shore up domestic support and to maintain a veneer of legitimacy for their international partners. 

So in summary, the author is stating that the world must either respect Putin's inability to recognize reality, or fight him. We need to either accept his fantasies as if they are reality or go to war. That is clearly a false dichotomy, because there are a wealth of options available to the West in between complete capitulation and full blown nuclear war. Including working to challenge the unprincipled and unrealistic assumptions at the core of the Russian propaganda campaign to justify the war. Reality also imposes its own limits on Putin and it's not really within the West's power to control how he reacts to events. The West however can and should stand up for its core self-determination and sovereignty principles, which should not be subject to change at the whim of dictators, rather than letting transitory and flawed assessments of Russia's actual power dictate a ""realist"" policy of appeasement that will only serve to undermine the international legal order that has proven so effective and valuable over the last 30 years.",a3d8036c415a8438c90ca7c3b5fe75d8eaba3baf,True,False,,,,,0,1654205293,,0,{},iaylius,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t1_iaxddyp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iaylius/,1654205305,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654176493.0

Your point on tax cuts -- itself a pro-corporate-establishment measure -- indicates this. He's just ""mask off"", i.e., he drops the dog-whistles. For example: The GOP making immigration from Mexico as hard as possible (while putting comparatively lesser emphasis on guarding the US-Canada border) is of course informed by prejudice against brown Mexicans. Trump just said the quiet part out loud.

Still, Trump got the support he needed in 2016, and even moreso in 2020 (though it didn't work out for him), because his policies are mostly Republican, and therefore very pro-corporation.

The way we reconcile Trump's pro-corporate-establishment bent with his populist appeal to the masses and disregard for procedure, is that he is a fascist.

They found that the first two contained microchips with parts of their manufacturing marks carefully obliterated, seemingly an effort to disguise their origin. But inside the third radio was an identical chip that had slipped by its Russian censors, showing it had been made by a company based in the United States. (Mr. Spleeters said his group would not publicize the names of the manufacturers until he had sent requests for information to each company asking how its wares ended up in the hands of the Russian military.)

Mr. Spleeters said it was not clear who had altered the markings or when the chips were delivered to Russia, though he said the attempt to mask their origin was intentional. In 2014, after the Russian invasion of Crimea, the United States imposed restrictions that were largely unilateral on shipping Russian high-technology items that could help its military abilities.

“It was neatly erased, maybe with a tool to take out just one line of markings,” Mr. Spleeters said. “Someone knew exactly what they were doing.”

Whether the recently imposed sanctions would result in a fundamental reduction of these kinds of supplies to Moscow was unclear, he said, given that Russia has such a large stockpile of Western technology.
His team also dissected the remnants of three different Russian surveillance drones, two of them called Orlan and 

Tachyon and one previously unknown model that Ukrainian officials called Kartograf. Inside the Orlan, they found six separate parts from companies with headquarters in the United States, and one each from companies based in Switzerland and Japan. In the other two drones, they pulled parts from corporations in the United States as well as in China, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan.

As Mr. Spleeters and his colleague worked, he asked a member of the Ukrainian security service about their findings of Western parts powering Russian weapons.
“It’s just business,” the officer replied.

“It’s a big business, and people were just selling chips and not caring or not able to know what they’d be used for eventually,” Mr. Spleeters said of the Western electronics companies. “I don’t think they’d be able to know who’d use them and for what purpose.”",50b33757a83840564432f9a7f388d771ed189c1b,True,False,,,,,0,1654200377,,0,{},iayag01,True,t3_v3hlh9,False,True,t1_iayafdr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3hlh9/us_technology_a_longtime_tool_for_russia_becomes/iayag01/,1654200392,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654171577.0
[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"With magnifying glasses, screwdrivers and a delicate touch from a soldering gun, two men from an investigative group that tracks weapons pried open Russian munitions and equipment that had been captured across Ukraine.
Over a week’s visit to Ukraine last month, the investigators pulled apart every piece of advanced Russian hardware they could get their hands on, such as small laser range finders and guidance sections of cruise missiles. The researchers, who were invited by the Ukrainian security service to independently analyze advanced Russian gear, found that almost all of it included parts from companies based in the United States and the European Union: microchips, circuit boards, engines, antenna and other equipment.

“Advanced Russian weapons and communications systems have been built around Western chips,” said **Damien Spleeters, one of the investigators with Conflict Armament Research,** which identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition. He added that Russian companies had enjoyed access to an “unabated supply” of Western technology for decades.

U.S. officials have long been proud of their country’s ability to supply technology and munitions to the rest of the world. But since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the United States has faced an unfortunate reality: The tools that Russian forces are using to wage war are often powered by American innovation.

Still, while the technology made by American and European companies has been turned against Ukraine, the situation has also given the United States and its allies an important source of leverage against Russia. The United States and dozens of countries have used export bans to cut off shipments of advanced technology, hobbling Russia’s ability to produce weapons to replace those that have been destroyed in the war, according to American and European officials.

On Thursday, the Biden administration announced further sanctions and restrictions on Russia and Belarus, adding 71 organizations to a government list that prevents them from buying advanced technology. The Treasury Department also announced sanctions against a yacht-management company that caters to Russian oligarchs.

While some analysts have urged caution about drawing early conclusions, saying the measures will take time to have a full effect, the Biden administration has called them a success. Since Western allies announced extensive restrictions on exports of semiconductors, computers, lasers, telecommunications equipment and other goods in February, Russia has had difficulty obtaining microchips to replenish its supply of precision-guided munitions, according to one senior U.S. official, who, along with most other officials interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters based on intelligence.

On Tuesday, when asked if a chip shortage was crippling the Russian military, **Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo,** who oversees export controls, said the answer was “an unqualified yes.”
“U.S. exports to Russia in the categories where we have export controls, including semiconductors, are down by over 90 percent since Feb. 24,” she said. “So that is crippling.”

The restrictions halt direct technological exports from the United States and dozens of partner nations to Russia. But they also go beyond traditional wartime sanctions issued by the U.S. government by placing limitations on certain high-tech goods that are manufactured anywhere in the world using American machinery, software or blueprints. That means countries that are not in the sanctions coalition with the United States and Europe must also follow the rules or potentially face their own sanctions.

Russia has stopped publishing monthly trade data since the invasion, but customs data from its major trading partners show that shipments of essential parts and components have fallen sharply. According to data compiled by **Matthew C. Klein, an economics researcher who tracks the effect of the export controls,** Russian imports of manufactured goods from nine major economies for which data is available were down 51 percent in 
April compared with the average from September 2021 to February 2022.

The restrictions have rendered the old-school bombing runs on tank factories and shipyards of past wars unnecessary, Mr. Klein wrote. “The democracies can replicate the effect of well-targeted bombing runs with the right set of sanctions precisely because the Russian military depends on imported equipment.”

Russia is one of the world’s largest arms exporters, especially to India, but its industry relies heavily on imported inputs. In 2018, Russian sources satisfied only about half of the military-related equipment and services the country needed, such as transportation equipment, computers, optical equipment, machinery and fabricated metal, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development compiled by Mr. Klein.

The remainder of equipment and services used by Russia were imported, with about a third coming from the United States, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and other partner governments that imposed sanctions together on Moscow.￼

U.S. officials say that in concert with a wide variety of other sanctions that ban or discourage commercial relations, the export controls have been highly effective. They have pointed to Russian tank factories that have furloughed workers and struggled with shortages of parts. The U.S. government has also received reports that the Russian military is scrambling to find parts for satellites, avionics and night vision goggles, officials say.

Technology restrictions have harmed other Russian industries as well, U.S. officials say. Equipment for the oil and gas industry has been degraded, maintenance for tractors and heavy equipment made by Caterpillar and John Deere has halted, and up to 70 percent of the commercial airplanes operated by Russian airlines, which no longer receive spare parts and maintenance from Airbus and Boeing, are grounded, officials say.

But some experts have sounded notes of caution. **Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA,** a research institute in Arlington, Va., voiced skepticism about some claims that the export controls were forcing some tank factories and other defense companies in Russia to shutter.

“There’s not been much evidence to substantiate reports of problems in Russia’s defense sector,” he said. It was still too early in the war to expect meaningful supply chain problems in Russia’s defense industry, he said, and the sourcing for those early claims was unclear.

**Maria Snegovaya, a visiting scholar at George Washington University who has studied sanctions on Russia,** said the lack of critical technologies and maintenance was likely to start being felt widely across Russian industry in the fall, as companies run out of parts and supplies or need upkeep on equipment. She and other analysts said even the production of daily goods such as printer paper would be affected; Russian companies had bought the dye to turn the paper white from Western companies.

“We expect random disruptions in Russia’s production chains to manifest themselves more frequently,” Ms. Snegovaya said. “The question is: Are Russian companies able to find substitutes?”
U.S. officials say the Russian government and companies there have been looking for ways to get around the controls but have so far been largely unsuccessful. The Biden administration has threatened to penalize any company that helps Russia evade sanctions by cutting it off from access to U.S. technology.

In an interview last month, Ms. Raimondo said the United States was not seeing any systematic circumvention of the export controls by any country, including China, which aligned itself with Russia before and during the invasion of Ukraine. Companies were making independent decisions not to engage with Russia, even though the country was “trying very hard to get around” the global coalition of allies that had imposed export controls, Ms. Raimondo said.

“The world knows just how very serious we are, and our allies are, about prosecuting any violation,” she said. “There will be real consequences for any companies or countries that do try to get around the export controls.”
Chinese trade data also suggest that most companies are following the restrictions. Although China has continued to buy Russian energy, Chinese exports to the country have fallen sharply since the invasion.",12b0f8691e8a86e4462b59198739f691acdeec0a,True,False,,,,,0,1654200369,,0,{},iayafdr,True,t3_v3hlh9,False,True,t3_v3hlh9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3hlh9/us_technology_a_longtime_tool_for_russia_becomes/iayafdr/,1654200385,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654171569.0

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"An air campaign against the rear areas makes sense from the Russian perspective for a few reasons. It's ""defending forward"" in that it forces the Ukrainians to keep some substantial percentage of their AA assets in the west, limiting their ability to interdict Russian bombing along the lines of contact and thus to carry out offensives. As you mention, that approach inflicts costs on the Ukrainian people, both in terms of economic disruption and human lives, which the Russians hope will motivate them to agree to less favorable peace terms. Although, again as you suggest, that may backfire. 

But I think the real motivation here is somewhat subtler. We are hearing this report from the Ukrainians, which is important context. It's not that the Russians are threatening a specific campaign because they think it will benefit them and we are hearing about that, it's that the Ukrainian general staff are expecting the Russians to make certain moves in the near future. The trigger for those moves could just be internal Russians concerns like deciding to try to take Odessa again. Although we all think that is impossible, the Russians clearly are not doing a very good job of assessing what is possible for them to achieve, so who knows what they might try. 

On the other hand, it's also possible that the Russians have no intention of making a push for Odessa and the Ukrainians are simply describing their expectations for how the Russians may react defensively to a counteroffensive. Specifically, both the Ukrainians and the Russians know that the Russians are weak on their southern flank and that the only assets the Russians still have available which can be quickly redeployed from other lines of effort to the southern axis are their bombers, close-support aircraft, and naval PGMs (which obviously are already deployed exclusively on that axis because of the geography but some of which may be held in reserve against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the region). 

Any ground units will need to be pulled out of combat elsewhere. So even assuming those units remain combat effective and do not need time for rest and reconstitution before being committed on a different axis, it would be a matter of a week or more just to pull them back and transport any substantial quantity of ground forces from the east or north. Especially because Russian GLOCs near Kherson seem to be tied more strongly to the vertical routes back though Crimea rather than horizontally to other areas of the front. Meaning they aren't set up for taking a bunch of equipment and transporting it from, e.g., Donestk City to Kherson directly so much as Donestk to Rostov to Crimea to Kherson, or something along those lines. And to the extent that the Russians are capable of directly pivoting between the two areas, the GLOCs between Donestk and Kherson are substantially more vulnerable to interdiction given their proximity to the front. 

So the Ukrainians can reasonably expect if they start pushing hard near Kherson and successfully interdict any reinforcements from the east, the first (and potentially only) counter from the Russians will be to escalate their air campaigns in the area to try to disrupt any Ukrainian offensive momentum. The Ukrainians are therefore just reporting the increased risk of that course of events playing out, rather than stating any claims about the near or long term Russian offensive strategy.",84a097260ed5d7e55bb09c992abfd43d598d2455,True,False,,,,,0,1654197937,,0,{},iay4sj7,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t1_iaxm5ic,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iay4sj7/,1654197954,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654169137.0

Besides that relying on CAS means long periods where they won't be available, deconflction issues with arty, mortars, helicopter support including medevac, worrying about enemy ADA, etc, there are further stipulations.

For instance, danger close for bombing is 600 meters from friendlies, CAS aircraft have to get direct eyes on both friendly and enemy positions to engage closer after which they can drop within the Risk Estimate Distance, which is 135 meters from friendlies for the small diameter bomb, the absolutely smallest bomb that can be dropped and the rarest (distances extend as they get bigger). That means NOTHING that is closer is being engaged. And if the pilots flying at 15,000 ft AGL at .6 mach speed can't see you and the enemy, it's back to 600 meters.

Hard to do so when Intel can pretty much do the same thing (I'm handwaving much of the intricacies away here) as TSMC. From the Chinese side, I'd imagine that it'd be of concern, enough that they would very much prefer a negotiated outcome, but if kinetic attacks occur I can guarentee you that those plants won't survive, not from a directed attack but simply because the sheer precision required means that any form of impact is going to knock out the production line.


And that's before we even get to the issue that China doesn't lack a fab, it lacks fab suppliers. SMIC has already demonstrated that it is able to make acceptable semiconductor devices for midrange consumer electronics, while much of China's HPC runs on legacy nodes that can also be supplied by SMIC (more handwaving here). The issue now is that they need to source EUV machines from ASML, which has a monopoly on the market, as well as other equipment from the likes of Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, Nikon, Canon, Applied Materials, etc, as well as the support contracts and staff (large parts of these equipments operate in a black box condition with only the service engineers having the ability to modify or repair them). These are things that China cannot acquire if they are sanctioned much like the Russians are right now.

In many ways I agree with your statement, US and its allies are not worried about TSMC, and if missiles start flying across the Strait then there won't be much left to worry about, but I would propose that the lack of mention in (I would imagine) military documents and publications is simply due to the fact that TSMC remains an economic deterrence during peacetime that would stop being a factor if an actual war breaks out.

This is what almost every analyst with military experience expected. They thought that Russia might feint toward Kyiv to draw off defenders from the Donbas but would focus on Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv Oblasts, maybe go for a land bridge to Crimea by seizing Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts, and if everything went well, maybe try to grab everything north of the Dnieper and/or Odessa. The actual, serious thrust for Kyiv threw off almost everyone and cost Russia thousands of casualties and POWs, not to mention hardware, and the successful defense of Kyiv played a major role in the West sending weapons and equipment.

The last I saw from Prof. Michael Clarke on SkyNews is that Ukraine is withdrawing from Severodonetsk but the lines are stabilizing at the Siverski Donets River because neither side can successfully cross it for offensive purposes in any real numbers.

I thought it was informative as it compares and contrasts the different self propelled guns that are being used now by Ukraine and Russia. And the war now has shown artillery to be a major factor in conflict. 

----------------

&gt; * ...artillery gained the title, the “King of battle”. During those conflicts, the majority of casualties were inflicted by shell fire rather than by bullets, bayonets or grenades. 

&gt; * ...in the event of a future conflict, air support for manoeuvring Western forces cannot be guaranteed because of the progress made in Anti-Access/Area denial (A2AD) systems. This problem is even more acute in the case of a near-peer adversary like Russia.

&gt; * Traditionally, in Russian military doctrine, manoeuvring troops support the artillery rather than the reverse. The preferred role of massed artillery and rockets systems is to destroy enemy formations, whilst manoeuvring infantry and tank formations have the role to fix the enemy. 

&gt; * This last point is in stark contrast with Western military thinking, where artillery is used to support manoeuvring troops. For this reason, it is widely recognised that the use of en masse indirect fire support at the tactical level is a signature characteristic of the Russian way of war. This explains why Russian military formations have a quantitatively superior artillery, with a broader variety of munitions available and the ability to strike at longer ranges than similar Western formations.

&gt; * In view of the importance of indirect fire support in Russian doctrine, it is no surprise that the Missile and Artillery Troops (Raketnyye Voyska i Artilleriya) of the Russian Ground Forces are prime beneficiaries of the country’s overall military modernisation. This modernisation process has been realised through the development and acquisition of new artillery and multiple launch rocket systems...

&gt; * As an example, the main self-propelled howitzer in service in the US Army is still the M109A6 “Paladin”, with a firing range of 22 km (unassisted), a firing rate of one round per minute and no ability to conduct multiple-round, simultaneous impact fire missions. In stark comparison, the newest Russian artillery system, the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV, has a firing range of 40 km (unassisted) and a rate of fire estimated to be between 9 and 16 rounds per minute. 

&gt; * The current artillery imbalance between Western and Russian ground forces is aggravated by the fact that most European nations have signed the 2008 Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions, but Russia hasn’t.

&gt; * The conflict in Donbas should serve as a reminder to Western militaries that artillery can still reign supreme on the battlefield. So far, it is estimated that about 80-85% of all casualties in that conflict were caused by artillery fire. If Western land forces wish to maintain their edge against a near-peer adversary such as Russia, they need to refocus their efforts on putting more rounds and rockets down-range, in less time, from a greater range.

This is the part that I am hung up on. Namely, how will Putin keep ""escalating the war""? Or, more accurately, with what? The war on the ground in Ukraine has not escalated. If anything, it has narrowed significantly after the withdrawal from Kyiv. What was once a fight for the entirety of Ukraine is now sectioned into a fight for part of Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin has already put his nuclear forces on higher alert. Russia has already bombed civilian centers en masse and committed massacres of civilians. They were planning on blockading Ukraine from Day One and even now they're negotiating to actually allow grain shipments through. Putin has demurred on mobilization and frankly they seem committed to doing everything to avoid it. So, given all of that, where is the escalation? What's it going to look like? It also contradicts her previous statement, that Russia is happen with essentially a perpetual conflict in Ukraine (which I don't agree with at all, how can Russia sustain an indefinite conflict in Ukraine economically and militarily?). Clearly, perpetual conflict in Ukraine is not an escalation. So what's the escalation going to be? Actually shifting of nuclear posture? Cyber attacks on the West? Cutting off all gas supplies (and by extension, committing economy seppuku)? We've been discussing these scenarios for a while and none of them seem to have manifested, so I am curious what the author thinks the pathway of escalation looks like here, or arguably what the point of any of those options would be. I can't imagine a scenario in which cyber attacks or gas removal or shifting nuclear posture actually forced a Western capitulation (I guess) so it looks like we're just stuck in a death spiral then, assuming this author is correct.",7ebb5651680fa9214ca3010a3b6c5cec3a4e9766,True,False,,,,,0,1654194323,,0,{},iaxwdym,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t1_iawpayv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iaxwdym/,1654194342,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654165523.0

Perhaps.

In response to human rights abuses by Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, NATO launched an air campaign against Serbian forces.   After 78 days of air operations, Serbian forces were withdrawn from Kosovo, and ground-based peacekeepers from Russia and several NATO countries were allowed in to keep the peace on the ground.

see, for instance, https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1365/RAND_MR1365.pdf 

Chapter Four,  titled ""Why Milosevic gave up when he did"", opens with:

&gt; On the one hand, there was the view of
those air power proponents who were wont to conclude up front that
“for the first time in history, the application of air power alone forced
the wholesale withdrawal of a military force from a disputed piece of
real estate.”   On the other hand, there was the more skeptical view
offered by the commander of the international peacekeeping forces
in Kosovo, British Army Lieutenant General Sir Michael Jackson, who
suggested that “the event of June 3 [when the Russians backed the
West’s position and urged Milosevic to surrender] was the single
event that appeared to me to have the greatest significance in ending
the war.”

&gt; 
&gt; Thus, thanks to the mechanism, which is also positively perceived in the Russian Federation and Ukraine, it will be possible to clear the territories around the Black Sea ports and supply grain reserves to foreign markets.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"One aspect often overlooked is the slow movement of the Russian military. 

After Russia's initial invasion, they have been moving very very slowly. Slowly mobilizing. Using bandaid solutions rather than full mobilization. Adding new equipment slowly. Using air power slowly (~100 fixed wing sorties a day vs ~1000 that they need). Using rail and ground forces to move troops in, slowly. It's how Russia has basically approached every recent war (Georgia and Chechnya) except for the overtaking of Crimea. 

To me, an invasion is all about rapidly overwhelming the enemy forces. Because if you can move quickly, you can catch your enemy off guard and demoralize them before they have a chance to mobilize and respond. This is one major advantage of US forces as they can use air power, coordination, intelligence, and professionalism to move very quickly. 

Hypothetical: If the US was doing the same Hostomel operation, they would have preceded the operation with a very sophisticated SEAD (combination air, drone, and ground intel to find enemy positions) attack. Then, would have continued with the landing of the troops (probably a thousand) using helicopters a few hours after the SEAD operation, then support them with 100s of sorties a day. Granted, they would have taken heavy losses (probably around 10%) to manpads, but would have overwhelmed any ground forces. Within about 24 hours, the US military would have had the area secured and be bringing in heavy equipment (tanks - support soldiers) via the airfield. The air would have been the conveyor belt, not the long road from Belarus. 

Russia did not do that. They moved at a slow, methodical pace. And that's what you see in Michal Kofman's analysis. He's basically giving reasoning behind the slow pace of Russia's military, and that is why they failed. 

It's deeper than that though. Their entire political system is designed to move slowly. Part of the reason Russia didn't mobilize quickly is because Putin can't without spreading propaganda that will slowly convince Russians that full mobilization is the right call. He has to spread the lies. Lies do not move quickly. 

It is possible for the Russian military to move quickly, but that would require them not to spread propaganda. That would require them to act in a truthful manner, aka, a defensive war. 

This is actually kind of a deep concept. If you want to use your military for offense against a well equipped enemy, you need to build out a capability in infantry that can rapidly maneuver along with very good air power capability. That's the only way to do a modern Blitzkrieg (meaning demoralized the enemy by out maneuvering them). An attacking military, like Russia, cannot depend on heavy equipment as heavy equipment moves too slowly and is vulnerable to breakdowns and man portable anti-tank/air weapons. 

This air power capability gets really really complicated when we look at a future with drones and proliferated manpads. Who knows how that will shake out.",369454464df11c834a7cb6bd745af768d546bf85,True,False,,,,,0,1654189651,,0,{},iaxl8i1,False,t3_v39z79,False,True,t3_v39z79,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v39z79/not_built_for_purpose_the_russian_militarys/iaxl8i1/,1654189665,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654160851.0

&gt; * In this capacity it is still dangerous. Small vessels equipped with long-range precision strike capabilities like the Kalibr cruise missile can do a great deal of damage to targets across Europe from safe bastions close to Russia’s shores.

[],False,,ass_pineapples,,,[],,,,text,t2_g0xhv,False,False,"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ a lot of unlikely things have been happening. I still think you're really underestimating a more worst case scenario. Russia is still pushing in, and counteroffensives in the East/South-East haven't been as effective as we hoped. This is turning into a marathon, and Russia has a lot more endurance than Ukraine unfortunately. I'm hoping that Ukraine can turn things around and push back, but a lot of people are making it seem as though it'll be a cakewalk when it really isn't. Western supplies will continue flowing in for as long as politically sustainable, I think Putin and the Kremlin have a point when they say that fatigue is very real and can set in at some point with this war, especially if economic conditions continue to deteriorate globally. 

Do I think that what I posted as a worst-case scenario is 100% realistic? No, I don't, I don't even think any of that will happen. It doesn't matter though, because you should *always* plan for the worst, hope for the best. To me, the worst is Russia taking this as seriously as they possibly can, using all of the tools at their disposal to win this conflict.

[],False,,manofthewild07,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ahfz,False,False,"Very timely and insightful, especially the breakdown in conscript vs contract within each battalion. For months now I've had to argue with people here about the role of conscripts. As we should know, they're not going to be put in tanks, or conduct advanced maneuvers, or anything like that, at least not in significant numbers. They just don't have the level of training needed.   
Consequently any future mobilization will suffer from the same issues the Russian forces have now. They can't just call up tens of thousands of poorly trained and poorly equipped reservists as infantry and throw them at the front lines and expect to overwhelm Ukraine by sheer numbers. Reservists aren't going to be very useful when Russia now needs to replace lost tank operators (and tanks), recon units, artillerists, engineers, etc (not to mention logistical support, equipment, and qualified leadership needed for all the new units). A mobilization and more infantry would have been significantly more useful in the beginning of the war to supplement the professional soldiers, not after months and tens of thousands of losses.  
As they point out, and we all have known for a while now, their just armor doesn't have enough infantry support. The infantry needs to be at a certain level of competence to begin with, which is why I dont think a mobilization would help at this point. Its probably the reason why Russia preferred to hire Wagner and Marines, and even ask for experienced forces from Syria and other allies, rather than put conscripts on the front lines or call up reservists.   
Its amazing to think just how backwards this whole war has been. Russia could have started by storming just the south and south east and probably taken them fairly quickly, maybe even controlled Odessa by now. They could have then spent a couple months digging in defenses and then made an offense on Kyiv if they really still felt the need to.   
In that scenario, I wonder if western support would have been slower and less enthusiastic if Russia's initial attacks would have been kept to the south and left the gov't heads in Kyiv alone... but instead Russia threatened the heads of the democracy and spread themselves way too thin and are going to pay the price for years, if they'll ever be able to build their Army back up again.",b80160b629c12b52eac95fe4ba70e076896505a2,True,False,,,,,0,1654185180,,0,{},iaxaogh,False,t3_v39z79,False,True,t3_v39z79,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v39z79/not_built_for_purpose_the_russian_militarys/iaxaogh/,1654185199,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654156380.0

First, I always try imagining we are talking about Country A and Country B instead of China/Russia/USA and see whether anything rings false. Very often our unconscious bias seeps into the word we use.

One of the little PR tricks professionals use is calling stuff *Person's* and not *Country's*. Putin's War, Putin's decision, Putin's goal (but never Zelensky's war or Biden's armament programme). This war is actually Russia's, not Putin's. Practically the entire country is behind it almost unanimously. But calling it Putin's makes it sound weaker, more dictatorial, unsupported.

\- ""how external observers see events and how they are viewed from the Kremlin"" - another subtle implication that there is ""the world \[external\] position"" and ""Kremlin's position"", from which we easily deduce that it is the Kremlin that must be wrong. In reality, there is no world position. There is the West (1 billion people), Russia (0.15bn), Russia's ally China (1.5bn) and the rest (5bn) are mostly uninterested.

\- ""such as Russia’s incapacity to achieve a military victory"" - it is implied that this is a fact, one that ""Putin"" just refuses to recognise. It is far from a fact and there are completely realistic political decisions and escalations that might reverse such a trend.

\- ""without considering Russian demands on Russification"" - Russia has no demands on Russification. What they call denazification is something completely different and it is intellectually dishonest to portray it that way.

We are going to or seeing it right now how they roll when they do that instead of deep striking (which to my knowledge also one of their doctrines, but well that wasnt really executed as it should have been)

On the mass artillery side. I think it isnt exactly true that it cannot be challanged. It also have a lot of draw backs with mobility,supplies, AA requierments, deployment times etc. You can pull away from them and try to hit them on the move or when they are not set up(of course they will be covering each other), you can use ambushes and dispersed forces and so on so on. I dont say its a bad doctrine (ask anyone who were at the receving end of it, there is a reason we hear that UAF fighters are terrified of their artillery.), but its not an unstoppable, game breaking something.

[],False,,an_actual_lawyer,,,[],,,,text,t2_6pvo3,False,True,"&gt; This stems from the mistaken idea that Russia’s main goal is to seize control of large parts of Ukraine—and therefore, when the Russian military performs badly, fails to advance, or even retreats, that this amounts to failure. However, Putin’s main goals in this war have never been to acquire pieces of territory; rather, he wants to destroy Ukraine in what he calls an “anti-Russia” project and stop the West from using Ukrainian territory as a bridgehead for anti-Russian geopolitical activities.

This is pants-on-head crazy.  Russia ***tried*** to sieze all of Ukraine during the first 3 days of the war.  They failed.  The fact that the end game may have been setting up a puppet government does not mean they didn't seek to control ""large swaths of Ukraine.""

Putin's ultimate legacy with respect to Ukraine-Western relations will be to galvanize the population that wasn't anti-Russia a decade ago into a population of hardcore Russian haters for at least 2 generations.  

&gt;All this means that the Western dilemma—to double down on support for Ukraine because Putin is losing or to appease Putin because he is desperate and dangerous—is fundamentally misguided. There can be only two possible outcomes. Either the West changes its approach to Russia and begins to take seriously the Russian concerns that led to this war or Putin’s regime falls apart and Russia revises its geopolitical ambitions.

This is pure Russian propaganda, to the point where I'm reasonably convinced the author is paid by Russia.  The West was never trying to creep in on Russia.  Allowing Eastern European countries into NATO was seen as a way to insure prosperity for the people in those countries and the rest of NATO as it prevented Russia from turning them into backwards shitholes, like Russia has done with ***every*** country it has either invaded or meddled with.

The West wants the same thing for Russia as they always have:  stop being assholes.  No one really cares what happens internally in Russia as long as they respect the international community and stop invading their neighbors or installing puppet governments in the region.  *At the end of the day, this is what really irks Putin - that Russia is only relevant to the West when they're being assholes.  He dreams of the days when Russia was a true power, not the current situation where pre-war their economy was destined to be overtaken by others time and time again and where the population was overtaken by others time and time again.

&gt;So, whatever concessions Ukraine could make (regardless of how politically realistic they may be), Putin will continue escalating the war until the West changes its approach to the so-called Russian problem and admits that—as Putin sees it—the roots of Russian aggression are the result of Washington ignoring Russian geopolitical concerns for 30 years. This has been Putin’s real objective for a long time, and it remains unchanged. Unrealistic Russian demands rejected by Kyiv are even a way for the Kremlin to increase the stakes in a Russia-West confrontation, testing the West’s ability to stay united and consistent. The West today is looking at the problem in the wrong light: In seeking to stop Russia’s war, it focuses on Moscow’s artificial pretexts for its invasion of Ukraine and overlooks Putin’s obsession with the so-called Western threat as well as his readiness to use escalation to coerce the West into a dialogue on Russian terms. Ukraine is only a hostage.

If Putin wanted a divided West, he got the opposite.  I'm ""meh"" on Biden, but his administration absolutely destroyed Russia on the diplomatic stage, putting on a master class in Geopolitics, diplomacy, and unity building.  The idea of a united EU/NATO supporting Ukraine was unlikely 12 months ago.  The idea that these countries would enact serious sanctions, provide significant military support, and hurt their own economies to cut off Russian energy sales was ***laughable*** 12 months ago.  So how did that happen?  The classic ""give your opponent the rope and let them hang themselves with it.""

The Biden administration slow walked the intelligence they obtained about the war in the months and weeks prior.  First quietly, then publicly.  This forced Russia to not only deny the claims publicly - calling the administration all sorts of names - but ***more importantly, Russian diplomats were lying to other countries throughout the world.***  

In every embassy and consulate, Russian diplomats were asked whether the intelligence was real, whether Russia would invade Ukraine.  They said no, meaning they were either lying or they were lied to.  In either case, it became crystal clear that Russia could no longer be trusted. Meanwhile, US diplomats were in those same embassies and consulates securing promises:  ""yeah, I know they said they wouldn't invade, and I know you told them there would be consequences if they did, but lets talk about what those consequences should be.  Here is what we propose.""  It is always easier to get an agreement to the hypothetical rather than the actual situation.

By Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

[https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/01/putin-war-ukraine-west-misconceptions/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/01/putin-war-ukraine-west-misconceptions/) 

*One of the reasons it’s so difficult to understand Russian intentions—and what is at stake in the Ukraine war—is the significant divergence between how external observers see events and how they are viewed from the Kremlin. Things that appear obvious to some, such as Russia’s incapacity to achieve a military victory, are perceived completely differently in Moscow. The fact is that most of today’s discussions over how to help Ukraine win on the battlefield, coerce Kyiv into concessions, or allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to save face have little in common with reality.*  
  
*Here I will debunk five common assumptions about how Putin sees this war. The West needs to look at the situation differently if it wants to be more effective in its approach and decrease the risks of escalation.*

***Assumption 1: Putin knows he is losing.***  
  
*This stems from the mistaken idea that Russia’s main goal is to seize control of large parts of Ukraine—and therefore, when the Russian military performs badly, fails to advance, or even retreats, that this amounts to failure. However, Putin’s main goals in this war have never been to acquire pieces of territory; rather, he wants to destroy Ukraine in what he calls an “anti-Russia” project and stop the West from using Ukrainian territory as a bridgehead for anti-Russian geopolitical activities. As a result, Russia does not see itself as failing. Ukraine will not join NATO nor be able to exist peacefully without considering Russian demands on Russification (or “denazification” in Russian propaganda-speak) and “de-NATOfication” (known as “demilitarization” in Russian propaganda terms)—meaning a halt to any military cooperation with NATO. To follow through on these goals, Russia needs to sustain its military presence on Ukrainian territory and keep attacking Ukrainian infrastructure. There is no need for major territorial gains nor taking Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital (even if he dreamt about it in the beginning). Even the annexation of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which Moscow sees as only a matter of time, is an auxiliary, local goal to make Ukraine pay for incorrect, pro-Western geopolitical choices over the last two decades. In Putin’s eyes, he is not losing this war. In fact, he likely believes he is winning—and he is happy to wait until Ukraine concedes that Russia is here forever.*  


***Assumption 2: The West should find a way to help Putin save face, thus decreasing the risks of further, possibly nuclear, escalation.***

*Imagine a situation where Ukraine accepts most of Russia’s demands: It recognizes Crimea as Russian and the Donbas as independent, commits to a slimmed-down army, and promises to never join NATO. Will that end the conflict? Even if, to many, the answer appears to be an obvious “yes,” they are incorrect. Russia may be locked in a battle with Ukraine, but geopolitically, it sees itself as waging war against the West on Ukrainian territory. In the Kremlin, Ukraine is seen as an anti-Russian weapon in Western hands—and destroying it will not automatically lead to Russia’s victory in this anti-Western geopolitical game. For Putin, this war is not between Russia and Ukraine—and Ukrainian leadership is not an independent actor but a Western tool that must be neutralized.*

*So, whatever concessions Ukraine could make (regardless of how politically realistic they may be), Putin will continue escalating the war until the West changes its approach to the so-called Russian problem and admits that—as Putin sees it—the roots of Russian aggression are the result of Washington ignoring Russian geopolitical concerns for 30 years. This has been Putin’s real objective for a long time, and it remains unchanged. Unrealistic Russian demands rejected by Kyiv are even a way for the Kremlin to increase the stakes in a Russia-West confrontation, testing the West’s ability to stay united and consistent. The West today is looking at the problem in the wrong light: In seeking to stop Russia’s war, it focuses on Moscow’s artificial pretexts for its invasion of Ukraine and overlooks Putin’s obsession with the so-called Western threat as well as his readiness to use escalation to coerce the West into a dialogue on Russian terms. Ukraine is only a hostage.*  
  
  
***Assumption 3: Putin is not only losing militarily but also domestically, and the political situation in Russia is such that Putin could soon face a coup.***

*The opposite is the case, at least for the moment. The Russian elite have become so worried about how to guarantee political stability and avoid protests that they have consolidated around Putin as the only leader able to firm up the political system and prevent disorder. The elite are politically impotent, scared, and vulnerable—including those portrayed in Western media as warmongers and hawks. To make a move against Putin today is tantamount to suicide unless Putin starts to lose his ability to rule (physically or mentally). Despite new splits and cracks within the ranks and unhappiness with Putin’s policies, the regime stands firm. The main threat to Putin is Putin himself. Although time may be against him, the waking up of the elite is a process that will take much longer than many people expect. It will depend on how present Putin remains in day-to-day government.*  


***Assumption 4: Putin is afraid of anti-war protests.***

*The truth is that Putin is more afraid of pro-war protests and has to take into account the eagerness of many Russians to see the destruction of what they call Ukrainian Nazis. Public mood could drive escalation, prompting Putin to be more hawkish and resolute, even if it is a result of the Kremlin’s own propaganda. This is extremely important: Putin has awakened a dark nationalism he is more and more dependent on. Whatever happens to Putin, the world will have to deal with this public aggression and anti-West, anti-liberal convictions that make Russia problematic for the West.*  


***Assumption 5: Putin has been deeply disappointed in his entourage and greenlit the criminal prosecution of senior officials.***

*This is an intensely discussed issue in the West. It arises from speculation about the arrest of Putin’s former Deputy chief of staff Vladislav Surkov; the detention of Sergey Beseda, a top security officer responsible for Ukraine; and purges among Putin’s inner circle. All these rumors should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Firstly, there has been no confirmation of any of them. (Rather, high-placed sources suggest that neither Beseda nor Surkov have been arrested.) Secondly, Putin is likely upset and disappointed with his staff, but it’s not his style to purge his inner circle unless serious crimes have been committed. Intentions are all that matter to Putin, and if Russia’s secret services miscalculated or even misinformed him without malign intentions, there will be no prosecutions. Finally, the military campaign in Ukraine has been closely managed by Putin from the outset with very little room for subordinates to show any initiative.*  
  
*All this means that the Western dilemma—to double down on support for Ukraine because Putin is losing or to appease Putin because he is desperate and dangerous—is fundamentally misguided. There can be only two possible outcomes. Either the West changes its approach to Russia and begins to take seriously the Russian concerns that led to this war or Putin’s regime falls apart and Russia revises its geopolitical ambitions.*  
  
*For the moment, both Russia and the West appear to believe that their counterpart is doomed and that time is on their side. Putin dreams about the West suffering from political upheaval, whereas the West dreams about Putin being removed, overthrown, or dropping dead from one of many diseases he is regularly rumored to be suffering. No one is right. At the end of the day, a deal between Russia and Ukraine is only possible as an extension of an agreement between Russia and the West or as a result of the collapse of Putin’s regime. And that gives you an idea of how long the war could last: years, at best.*",8b48c98e0da2df9da6174d3bde67231e551ce77f,True,False,,,,,0,1654175435,,0,{},iawpayv,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t3_v3789l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iawpayv/,1654175451,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654146635.0

*China’s top diplomat said Beijing will work with Moscow to promote “real democracy,” reaffirming his country’s ties with Russia.*  
*“China is willing to work together with Russia and the global community to promote real democracy based on nations’ own conditions,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Wednesday via video link at a China-Russia think tank summit, according to a government statement.*

*The event was attended by his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.*  
  
*Wang added that “monopolizing the definition of democracy and human rights” to influence other nations was a tactic “doomed to fail,” in a veiled swipe at the United States, which has led a global chorus of condemnation against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.*  
  
*Since then, Beijing has sought to portray itself as neutral: Issuing statements supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and expressing concern about civilian casualties, while supporting President Vladimir Putin at the United Nations and blaming the US for provoking the war by encouraging the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.*  
  
*Still, President Xi Jinping declared a “no limits friendship” with Putin on the eve of the invasion, and hasn’t spoken with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy since the war began.*  
  
*Without referencing Putin’s ongoing military campaign, Wang said China and Russia should “continue to make important contributions” to global governance as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.*",46e4159ba9821afb2111d392504cb2ec2a1a904c,True,False,,,,,0,1654172982,,0,{},iawkpld,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t3_v3789l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iawkpld/,1654172994,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654144182.0

In short, pull back until air supremecy is gained, keep attackers at bay with missle strikes and the few but longer range artilleries they have. Once air is undercontrol. Bombed them to hell.

Other point is, they are integrated armies, neither France or the UK has very large armored formations (UK desert strom was still a sizable force), but they have sizable navies and air force.

And sure, you can talk all you want about ""morale"", but it's a dictatorship - dictatorships try to keep their soldiers fed and happy (for whatever reason).  Indeed, Americans report that Iraqi army units put up a fight - well, the first waves did anyway.

What changed?  America made it clear pretty early on that victory was impossible, so most of the rest of the Iraqi army didn't exactly bother.

If Russia had done the same here, we'd be looking at a different picture, but they couldn't.  In fact, they took to great lengths to paint themselves to the Ukrainians as defeatable.

Kyiv was 150 km from the border.  Airborne and armored troops were 15 km from Zelensky's office by the end of the first week.  They landed 50 helicopters **in the capital** on day 1.

That's despite all the failures, despite all the logistics garbage, despite Ukrainians putting up a good fight.  Even after Ukrainians started putting up a fight, people assessed Kyiv was going to fall relatively soon.  And that was a reasonable assessment - that is, if the army outside Kyiv had any level of competency or air support (capacities that we assessed the Russian army at the time to have).

The same capabilities you mock the west for focusing on could have ended the war in March.

Of course this is a tactical loss for Ukraine, but Russia was going to in any scenario achieve something, given what they are throwing in there.

The Ukrainian counter-offensive narrative is not really wrong, but it is extremely uncertain. It is obvious that Ukraine must counter attack eventually and that it is going to be very difficult. I personally expected Ukraine to put a greater pressure on the Izjum bulge than it seems they have. But any major counter-offensive was not expected prior to the summer. June-July have been mentioned as well as August for the beginning of such an offensive - contingent on western arms support.

Lots of observers read far too much into the overperformance of the TB2 in Nagorno-Karabakh and the initial weeks of this invasion and proclaimed revolution.

&gt; Can someone explain to me what this is supposed to mean? If it means that you could have put some infantry out in front of your tanks and avoided getting hit by a Javelin or Switchblade 600, its wrong. This guy greatly misunderstands how much ground infantry would have to control in order to keep a tank from getting killed by such weapon systems. Its particularly wrong in the case of a switchblade. ""Combined Arms"" may be an important military concept, but its being misused here. 

&gt; This is dramatically more difficult to do in an age of long range MANPATs. if the range on your ATGM system is 500 meters, this isn't that hard. When its 2km it is an order of magnitude more difficult (remember that the area from which someone could fire an ATGM at you increases with the square of the range of the ATGM). The idea that you're going to clear 12km2 surrounding the tank everywhere you go is unrealistic. With a switchblade, its not just unrealistic, its impossible. The area is far to vast. 

Screening is only part of the equation. Using infantry and other assets, which now includes drones, to push forward serves to limit ATGM teams from operating closer to armor and forces them to fire from range. This is generally more effective against SACLOS ATGMs however, modern fire and forget systems like Javelin and Spike are more mobile.

Another key part of of the equation is the use of tank formations to protect one another on the move. The easiest example is with a platoon, generally four tracks. The platoon are be split into two sections. While one section moves forward, the other provides overwatch against AT threat, preferably from a vantage point. After spotting a threat, the overwatch section will engage as fast as possible. When the moving section reaches its designated waypoint, they assume overwatch and the other section moves bounds forward, hence the name *bounding overwatch.*

This is a reliable way of mitigating many forms of threats by providing a means of detection and immediate retaliation against AT threats while on the move. It also works in larger formations at the company and battalion scale.

This idea does implicitly assume that individual tanks will be targeted. In that case, the targeted vehicle will have to rely on its own protection to attempt to survive while other units, including not only the overwatch but other assets such as infantry, IFVs, air power, etc, attempt to destroy the threat. Once upon a time that protection was merely armor, but now AFVs rely more and more on active protection against the most stressing threats.

This does mean that tanks will very likely die in some number depending on the specific engagement and threats involved. But the enemy also has to contend with losing their own AT teams and weapons. The US XM1147 round is designed in part for this specific mission, and has periodically looked at guided rounds for this purpose as well.

With systems like Swichblade it's a more complicated threat. They lack the thermal signature something like a Javelin would present, and can be launched from a range that precludes direct observation. But it is also slower, and relies on a datalink for reliable targeting. Which means it can be detected and possibly jammed by EW. It is also vulnerable to the same APS as ATGMs are, and can be engaged by C-sUAS systems that are being deployed by several nations, most prominently the US.

&gt; It is easy and stupid to claim that the enemy are just fools and there is nothing more to learn here.

An air campaign lasting days to weeks kills any surprise you can attain with a ground invasion and gives the enemy just enough time to setup defenses at strategic objectives.  It's counter-productive to achieving rapid operational success on the ground.  There's a reason Russia attempted it, they were just way too slow to achieve the type of early success they could have and probably should have with the strategy.  US forces are much more likely to pull this strategy off successfully because they have much greater logistics capacity, better and faster unit-tactical capabilities, and more capable airmobile forces.

And hopefully the ground movements are fast enough that enemy air defenses are way out of position or behind the curve by the time you have to worry about them.  

The US has produced around half a million PGMs, orders of magnitude more than any other country.  If that's not enough because the US wants to conduct a dozen other operations around the globe at the same time, they need to get their priorities straight.  

The Abrams has much better sensors to detect enemy targeting or to spot enemy troops in the first place.  They have much better trained crews.  The newest variants have good side protection.  And yes, better post-penetration protection if it comes to that.  

Once again, you're projecting Russian incompetence on the US.  The possibility the US would allow a Hostomel situation  to happen is effectively zero.

[],False,,Cdub7791,,,[],,,,text,t2_kglct,False,False,"While he raises some interesting questions, and it's certainly smart to have some humility about our capabilities, I feel he overstates the case a little. I think we might do pretty well in a peer conflict compared to Russia. My reasoning:

*  If we and our allies are united, the personnel and material resources we have are truly vast. NATO members together have nearly a billion citizens, and when you throw in our non-NATO allies and friendly countries, we're well over a billion. And those same countries are also some of the most technologically advanced in the world.  

*  I think we're a little quick to generalize the policy and military failures in Iraq and Afghanistan to other wars. We can debate all day about how these conflicts were mishandled, but I don't think it's *that* controversial to say part of the problem was that our forces were primarily trained, structured, and equipped for a traditional near-peer conflict, which didn't fit the counterinsurgent war we were fighting. And looking at the opening phases of Iraq 1 and 2 and Afghanistan separately, our forces were - on the whole - highly technically and tactically proficient. In a peer-on-peer conflict, we'd be doing what we're intended for and it's reasonable to assume we'd be at least moderately competent at it.  

*  Corruption will always be with us, and we have our fair share of it (*cough* Fat Leonard *cough*) but U.S./allied corruption tends more to the ""take an MRE box"" or ""pad your TDY invoice"" side than the ""rip out all the copper on base for scrap and sell my conscripts into slave labor"" side like in Russia. The corruption in the Russian military has done more damage to it than a thousand javelins. As long as we keep our corruption mostly under control I think it won't have an overwhelming effect on our future fights.

*  Our NCOs and junior officers really are motivated and well-trained for the most part. Sure, we could always be better, but the amount of instruction, mentoring, and education your average troop gets is nothing to sneeze at. Russian conscripts and even leaders are being thrown into heavy fighting with appallingly little instruction. I really believe that good soldiers can overcome a mediocre plan by leadership. 

*  We need to stop using WWII as a metric. Okay, that one isn't an argument, just a new peeve of mine. I think technology, doctrine, society, and a million other factors have shifted enough over 77 years that we need to be more cautious about applying lessons from that conflict. We are now almost the same distance in time from the beginning of WWII as that generation was from the end of the Civil War.  I am NOT saying throw out our history books, just to start acknowledging that the world has moved on.  

*  Unlike Russia, we are (at least for the time being) still a free society. If a peer war was going as poorly as the one in Ukraine, you can bet the media, citizens, retired officers, and even some active-duty personnel would be loudly demanding answers and changes. That can be a good or bad thing, but on the whole I think it's a net positive.   

*  Who exactly are we fighting in this scenario? I assume China?  This nebulous enemy we're always warned about is often conveniently anonymous. Peer conflicts don't rise in a vaccum. To say we're unprepared and overestimating our own capabilities, we really need a realistic yardstick.

Us on this sub too. Me included.

&gt;I don't know if this amounts to your ""defense in depth"",

Not mine. The accepted popular consensus points that the UA have been performing a brilliant active defense since day 1, starting with not defending the border, to ambush focused 'death by a thousand cuts"" defense during phase 1, that morphed into the current Severodonetsk salient campaign where they were expertly trading space for Russian casualties, while preserving their own manpower for future battles, doing proper maneuver warfare. But that's not what happened or is happening.

Historically, ""not a step back"" defensive policies to hold every inch of non strategic ground at all costs has nearly always been a political decision where heads of state overrule military advisors, emphasizing ground is more important than anything else for reasons of (insert answer, usually morale). And that's rarely been a good military decision. 

If Zelensky's current casualty reports are accurate, 60-100 KIA and 500 WIA a day for this campaign, times that by 45 days...that's a lot, probably on par with the Russians, possibly more. Considering most of their best units were there to start and they reinforced it before the battle started and moved more units since, a significant amount of the prewar UAF could have been destroyed. 

I have no clue what they were thinking. Maybe it's brilliant 4d chess move that makes the ghost of Sun Tzu cream his ghost pants, but I think it's risky to assume they had any better of a reason than what the Russians did during phase 1.

I think the first problem is practical. What's the right amount of equipment? Which way is the war going? Is Ukraine winning or losing? It's hard to say at this moment. And given it's a lag time of weeks or months depending on how complicated the equipment is, how do we know what will be happening in 2 weeks? Trying to calibrate your aid to reach a stalemate is a fool's errand.

The second problem is imagine if you tried to do that, and it leaked that you're intentionally prolonging the war, perhaps because somebody in your organization thought it was spectacularly immoral. There goes your international goodwill for the foreseeable future.

The third problem is that it isn't clear why it would help anything. Is it good for Putin that the war drags on? Not clear that it is, the longer it goes the more Russia suffers and the greater the political cost of ending it far short of the initial goals. Is it good for us to bleed Russia?

""Kyiv's best efforts to mask it""?

Kyiv's best efforts to mask it would be not talking about it.  That's what they did for a while and it worked just fine.

&gt;and Russian losses seem to be slowing despite the West's best efforts to amplify it.

Citing what, the russian government thing you said you weren't citing?

Idk what ""the west"" is, but Ukraine's overall estimates of Russian casualties per day have held steady, they're reporting fewer tank kills specifically.  Don't think they're ""amplifying"" anything more than they were before, I just think legitimately less tanks are entering the battlefield.

How can anyone even quote that with a straight face? He said that they are taking basically no casualties anymore which is ridiculous, first because people like Strelkov point out that yes, there still are massive casualties on both sides and second, there was, for example that little fiasco with the river fording attempt a few weeks ago which almost certainly killed hundreds. 

As for the rest: The lack of footage might simply be because of how the fronts have contracted and concentrated in the last few weeks. In the first couple of months, Russia was basically Zerg-rushing Ukraine without securing flanks. So what happened? Ukraine got in, took out supply convoys in the enemy's back and did some videos. But now we have those incredibly concentrated fronts in the Donbass, with secured flanks. How would anyone from any side be able to run an ambush behind enemy lines, much less make a smartphone vid? How would any Ukrainian manage to make pictures of shot down helo wrecks which might lie between the front lines?
