Kim LaSata introduced legislation that, when coupled with another bill in the package, would prohibit any local government in the state of Michigan from adopting sanctuary policies that protect individuals who are in the United States illegally.
&gt;
&gt;“These bills focus on letting law enforcement officers do their jobs and holding local governments who willfully violate the law accountable,” said LaSata, R-Niles. “Local officials should be focusing on the needs of their community and the safety of residents, not promoting policies that hinder law enforcement from upholding state and federal law.”
&gt;
&gt;Senate Bill 1044, sponsored by LaSata, would prohibit any county from establishing a sanctuary policy that prohibits law enforcement officers from doing their duty or assisting federal officials working to determine an individual’s immigration status. SB 1045, sponsored by Sen. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, would do the same for cities, townships and villages.
&gt;
&gt;The bills would give any local unit with one of these policies 60 days to come into compliance. After that time, local governments could face legal action, including proceedings initiated by a resident living in a locality that continues to violate the law.
&gt;
&gt;LaSata said this legislation is especially important as Title 42 restrictions are now being challenged in court. The Department of Homeland Security has previously stated that daily attempted border crossings will more than double if Title 42 is rescinded.
&gt;
&gt;“We should be promoting policies that put residents first and give law enforcement the tools they need to address illegal immigration,” LaSata said.
&gt;
&gt;Both bills were referred to the Senate Committee on Local Government for further consideration.

[],False,,bnav1969,,,[],,,,text,t2_rqa20,False,False,"Lend lease was a major factor, especially the trucks and food. However, the Soviets were fierce and were literally facing a genocidal enemy. Despite all the hyperbole, Russia is waging a war on Ukrainian state not genociding the population. It's as much a genocide as the US highway of death or 2003 invasion of Iraq was. Crimea still has the Ukrainian language as an official language that students can study in school and Russia officially still claims Ukrainians as brothers with a Nazi government. This matters.

But by the latter half of the war the Soviets were pushing some ridiculous quantities of weaponry and materiel, as they had moved their factories east of the Urals. They had essentially run supply lines all across Eurasia. It was seriously impressive considering the invasion they faced. The US was undoubtedly a different league but the Soviets held off quite a bit. And remember Germany was a near peer force that held literally all of Europe in a war time economy and much of Soviet citizenry themselves. Ukraine is not getting war time Europe and Russia still has significantly more weaponry. 

I think neither Russia or the west are close to their world war 2 production levels. And this doesn't take into factor that the nature of equipment is considerably different - these are rapid produce material. The US alone has depleted 1/3 to 1/2 of its stingers and can't replace it until 2024. Russia has straight up just taken this head on. It has obviously faced considerable loses but yet the momentum is absolutely on their side. And this is the US I'm talking about. Most of the other European countries are in an exponentially worse state. Poland is depleting its tanks like water balloons (and most were in horrible condition). Much of Europe is like this. Most of Europe is trying to unload its old Soviet stuff but these constituted a significant part of their arsenals. People insult Germany for not giving arms but due to their poor preparation, it's likely that they are not lying about readiness and stockpiles. Remember that years ago, France needed the US to get logistics into the Sahel for a counter insurgency - not even a full intensity war. These issues have been known in the British and French military even while fighting dudes in socks and sandals. 

The missile was Ukrainian but who's targeting was it? Missiles alone are useless, it's entire integrated ""kill chain"", including the targeting structure that matters. Very likely the information was provided by the US. And regardless those were Ukrainian stockpiles. Ukraine at this point has literally 0 industry - Kharkiv was its biggest tank factory and none of those are getting out. It's purely sustained on the west now. And western arms are not a monolith. Every country is sending different arms, different platforms, which need different parts, different trainings, etc. Russia is already wielding tanks it has repaired. Ukraine cannot do so at even a fraction of the level due to hodgepodge of weapons. 

Ukraine is effectively fully mobilized and in the process of doing so. Lots of people in the Western part are in territorial defense forces (essentially a regional national guard) and are refusing to be deployed outside their home region. More troops is hard because this isn't ww1 where we can throw some village boys with rifles into the trenches - they need significant training

Ukraine also has no economy or production at this point. 

And finally, arms don't mean offense or defense. They are simply a tool and it's the military doctrine and procedure that needs to be altered to go on the offensive. For the example, most of the donbass snd Kharkiv defenses are either trenches, fortified structures, or static defensives. Holding territory with this is a completely different ballgame than a counter offensive or offensive against Russians on the defensive. None of Ukraine's major counter offensives have really worked - it's just the Russians pulling back due to logistics issues or fighting re orientation. That's an achievement for Ukraine but don't miss the forest for the trees - it's no counter offensive. Their Kharkov offensive lost steam as soon as they left the artillery range. Kherson counter offensive is simply getting smashed as Russians have set up defensive grounds there. 

In 1941, the Soviets were a powerful army aimed at offensive operations. That wasn't a defensive position that could hold the Germans. Over the course of the next few years, they had to convert that into a defensive force to slow down the Germans enough to move materiel production east while raising new offensive army groups to push them back. The Ukrainians essentially need to do this. Practically impossible and more likely will lead to a full loss of their country. Exhausting yourself is foolish. Ukraine should accept the loss, try to give up Donbass and Crimea and build a fortress like country in the West to prevent anything else the Russians can do.

The US explicitly did not do this, and typically had very strict rules of engagement, which is why the idea of soldiers hiding as civilians became so prevalent during the conflict, as troops could only engage active combatants and not just those they thought were combatants. Additionally, for the first few months of the war, we were explicitly targeting only military targets and there very few civilian casualties. This is way different than what we're seeing on the ground now with Russia.

&gt;
&gt;however, russia has shown that they are everything but, hence why sweden and finnland are trying to join nato. neutrality is currently not possible.

This is as false as it gets, at least if you consider the historical perspective. Finland has enjoyed peace for a LOOONG time even when neighboring a much more powerful player, the USSR. And so did Sweden. I think the last Swedish war was ~200 years ago? And for Finland it was ~100 years ago?

If you only look at Russia's actions in the last 10 years you'd be justified in your conclusions, but that's clouding the view.

Now you may say Russia changed, and hence conclude the same. But  even this is questionable. Actually, it just doesn't stand up firmly to closer review. Russia didn't invade Ukraine for the longest time. Tensions started to ramp up only after 2008, IIRC, when NATO made claims to the extent of awaiting the Ukraine application for membership, along with Georgia. To which, Russia replied with a firm No Go.


&gt;as such to prevent escalation, we have to support ukraine with more and better weapons, so that russia will suffer a defeat.

This will not stop the war, as it didn't so far. But it's the best bet to start WW3.

It has already recovered. Take a look at the following graph: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=IQ-SY

Iraq still hasn't recovered from the Gulf War, but it has recovered from the American invasion (the US spent billions rebuilding the country).

[],False,,CommandoDude,,,[],,,,text,t2_9jqno,False,False,"&gt; The only reason Russian actions are viewed as more imperialist than americas is due to propaganda. 

Did America go into Iraq with the intent to annex it and ethnically cleanse it?

No. 

It's obvious that one war was more imperialist than the other. Especially in that it didn't commit anywhere near the same level of atrocities as Russia.

&gt; Objectively America should have been treated at least as strongly as Russia is now but thanks to the “rules based international order” aka American hegemony America can set or change whatever rules it wants and the rest of the world just accepts it even in the face of blatant hypocrisy. 

Yes, America should've faced consequences for its actions, but the fact is that it's also financially strong enough to *be* hypocritical. As is, no one could've done anything if they wanted to.

&gt; It resulted in the complete destruction of iraq with hundreds of thousands of civilian lives lost. Iraq may never be able to recover. I don’t know how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would be considered any worse than this.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed 4-5x the amount of civilians that died in Operation Iraqi freedom.

It has also led to the displacement of 7 million ukrainians, 1 million of which have essentially been deported to russia. At the moment Russia is engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in its occupied territories, and has systematically leveled several eastern Ukrainian cities with indiscriminate bombardments. 

Were Ukraine to become a decade long war, I'm sure Russia will kill far more than America did.

So yes, America bad, Russia worse.",28c557864c9746c24f31d51bf58dedc0bfb39f97,True,False,,,,,0,1654129682,,0,{},iaurfdi,False,t3_v2ph7v,False,True,t1_iaumv5c,/r/geopolitics/comments/v2ph7v/a_conversation_with_antony_blinken/iaurfdi/,1654129701,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654100882.0,

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Most city-folks don't want terrorist attacks; they don't want the Taliban leveraging violence against civilians to try and take political power.

There have been times when campaigns have been launched against them and many of them killed, other times that they've been invited into Pakistani-politics. It's a combination of a partially-illegitimate democratic will against modern thinking (education, social freedom for women, etc.) and the people in government power being payed off by moneyed military and economic interests.

Some western news sources may paint Imran Khan, the recently deposed Prime Minister, as ""pro-Taliban"", but it's mostly just anti-US. To many of you that might be bad anyways, but compared to what Pakistanis deal with a simple political position is better than a corrupt one. The PTI party is probably our best chance at creating a movement that could fix at least some of the basic government flaws that allow corruption, on the basis that it's liberal enough but doesn't piss of the conservative Muslim majority that much.
