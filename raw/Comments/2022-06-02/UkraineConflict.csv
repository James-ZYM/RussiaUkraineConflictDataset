Communism is a political ideology, if you grew up in a Communist country you were expected to learn the ideology (depending on your age). That is, the typical writings of  Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and especially Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who is the most influential with the Russians. For the Asian version of this ideology you were expected to learn and memorize Mao's writings.

This did not happen for you, since you convinced yourself that Communism is an economic system, when in fact that is only about 1/3 of the big picture.

Begin your studies here, if you are interested in finding out where you grew up, versus where the ideology was supposed to achieve.

&gt; KYIV, May 31 - Ukrainian forces were holding out in the eastern industrial city of Sievierodonetsk on Tuesday, resisting Russia&amp;#039;s all-out assault to capture a bombed-out wasteland that Moscow has made the principal objective of its invasion.

&gt; Russia, responding to Western sanctions after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, widened its gas cuts to Europe on Tuesday with Gazprom saying it would cut supplies to several &amp;quot;Unfriendly&amp;quot; countries which have refused to accept Moscow&amp;#039;s roubles-for-gas payment scheme.

&gt; Ukraine says Russia has destroyed all of the city&amp;#039;s critical infrastructure with unrelenting bombardment, followed by wave after wave of mass ground assaults involving huge numbers of casualties.

Which isn't suistainable in the slightest, you realize that right? Russia is depleting manpower and equipment faster than they can replace them. Meanwhile Ukraine is still building up. They are continously training new people. They are continously recieving new and BETTER equipment.  

Russia will culminate very soon, and there is NOTHING they can do in the short term to stop that. Because even if they declare war TODAY. It would still be months before that would bring in noticable number of additional manpower. That is if they can even equip them, which is a really big ""IF"". 

&gt;They are committed to using their size and weight advantage

Which they are squandering on gains not worth much. Putin is looking for something he can call a victory, the resources Russia is expending to get them are not worth it. 

&gt;The ground lost won't be gained back easily.

It will be easier to take back from Russia once they are spent. Than it is to hold against their amassed assault. It is pretty clear that Ukraine in Donbas right now are focused on simply absorbing the Russian advance and give ground when nessesary. 

This is what attrition looks like. You don't hold ground at any cost. What matters is what it will cost you, and cost the enemy. Russia right now are are trying to advance at any cost. It would be foolish by Ukranians to try and adapt the same mentality. Their best option is to make them pay as high as price as possible while keeping their own losses in check.

Because by doing that, eventually Russia is spent.",4257993ff6072c1c68a507155bbc71cf07fc065e,True,False,,,,,0,1654130815,,0,{},iautv1m,False,t3_v1qe77,False,True,t1_iaurn1t,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v1qe77/russian_army_on_brink_of_collapse_as_putin_loses/iautv1m/,1654130827,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654102015.0

No doubt Ukraine is prioritizing Kharkiv and Kherson, and I don't blame them, but it doesn't dull the sting of losing severodonetsk and what it means for Russia. 

The tactics Ukraine have used have been effective, using their home field advantage like you said, but are being given less of a chance to use them due to changes in Russian doctrine, no doubt in response to atrocious losses to basically shoulder mounted weapons. Russia isn't going to switch tactics back to what they started with. They are committed to using their size and weight advantage.
