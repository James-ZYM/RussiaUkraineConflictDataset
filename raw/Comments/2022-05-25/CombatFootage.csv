Out of 300ish tanks in total committed to the invasion into Lebanon, 5 were destroyed. 20-some were disabled. 50-some were hit and damaged.

The 401st was an example of what happened to the Israeli armored forces when they were commited into the fight. They were peppered with atgms and rpgs. They took losses at an unsustainable rate. 

You seem to be quibbling over the idea of a totally destroyed tank, or a tank that is knocked out because it is a mobility kill. The Israel to lose 10% of its tank force in a matter of days, is kind of a problem. Whether those tanks are turned to burning slag, or they are left behind, or they have to be towed back to a facility to be repaired. More tanks have to be used to protect the recovery process, which would result in more tanks destroyed or knocked out.

The 401st came under heavy fire. Took losses to their equipment, and then the Brigade commander ordered a retreat while they were on a rescue operation. Leaving behind the battalion commander. 

The Merkava is designed first and foremost for crew survivability. So it was successful in that. What it was also successful in, was demonstrating how effective modern RPGs and ATGMs are against even the most heavily protected MBT in the world.

Hezbollah is JUST an irregular militia, with high motivation and access to relatively high quality man portable anti-tank and anti-air weapon systems, and they were able to inflict ~10% losses on the Israeli tanks in a relatively short period of time. In a rather small conflict, both geographically, and in terms of forces fighting.

Of course Ukraine is going to inflict heavier tank losses on Russia. They have better intel than Hezbollah. They have better equipment than Hezbollah. They outnumber the Russians badly. Basically, if Hezbollah could do that, which by all standards was a massive success for them, and a massive humiliation for the Israelis (which they consider it themselves as a humiliation) then what did people think Ukraine was going to do when they have better circumstances than Hezbollah by orders of magnitude. A

To reiterate. If Hezbollah was able to do that to the Israelis, anyone expecting Russia to roll over Ukraine if Ukraine was going to fight hard, was paying a attention to the wrong wars to take their queues from. 

Why? Israel is more capable than Russia at a tactical level. Ukraine is more capable than Hezbollah.

The video starts midway the LNR their assault. Whether guns were fired or explosions were heard or a Ukrainian soldier sounded the alarm is unknown.

At 0:20 the video is cut. The first LNR soldier rushing the first bunker was likely shot and killed.

0:30 a Ukrainian soldier likely hears the gunfire from this initial encounter, and runs towards their trench, to support them but he's hesitant; realizes the enemy is in his trench and likely shoots and dashes backwards but is engaged and killed with riffle fire. 

At 0:32 the video is cut again. Ukrainians likely responded with tossing grenades.

At 0:54 the LNR toss a grenade into a covered area of the trench, likely an entrance to an underground wooden makeshift bunker. Possibly Ukrainian soldiers inside who maybe are shooting at them.

2:20 Front LNR soldier advancing is shot and killed, he slumps over into the side of the trench. The secondary soldier tries to open fire past him.

2:25 we see air burst grenades being thrown at LNR troops by Ukrainian soldiers from far away and it's danger close to their comrades. This stops the LNR their advance and they retreat. We can also see how close their are to Ukrainian soldier to their left in the side way trench who is going to be center stage of this fight for the next 2 minutes.

2:36 we see the Ukrainian soldier coming out of the dug bunker in the trench who just shot and killed the front LNR soldier. He retreats to the second trench with a second bunker there and will later on retreat further at 3:00. This Ukrainian soldier is likely injured with grenade shrapnel already. This is what saved his life because the grenade tosses after this would have killed him. Tactical retreat.

2:58 Ukrainian soldier in center of screen (also already injured from grenade shrapnel) shoots and hits several LNR. They shoot back and hit him in the left shoulder area. You can see the blood spray. 

03:10 The front LNR soldier who was also shot retreats and tells his buddies to throw their nades and points in the direction he wants them to throw.

3:15 the LNR soldier to the bottom left tosses the grenade directly in the trench where the Ukrainian soldier is, the other LNR soldier tosses it further down the trench.

3:18 The same Ukrainian soldier picks up that live grenade tossed at him and throws it back, it detonates mid air. The Ukrainian soldier flinches, he was likely hit with shrapnel.

3:25 they throw 2 more grenades further; clearly their own dead LNR soldier near where the Ukrainian soldier is holed up isn't worried about anymore.

3:42 Ukrainian soldier again picks up a live grenade and tosses it back at the LNR, it detonates mid air but a bit further.

3:48 Ukrainians throw another airbursting grenade that shoot shrapnel downwards, this one was extremely close to their injured comrade. I do not believe the LNR have airburst grenades though I maybe wrong. LNR also toss 1 more grenade further down the trench.

3:58 Ukrainian Soldier is now killed by a grenade tossed at him, he already lost allot of blood from the gunshot and shrapnel at this point.

4:11 another grenade is thrown in the side trench which absolutely finished the soldier off.

This was a giant grenade tossing match and shows that all you need is someone down the trench line with a MK42 to completely suppress a nade team trying to work their way upwards.

The LNR also failed in their attack by a few brave Ukrainian men and the LNR took deaths and injured themselves, which is not focused on in this drone footage.

Chechnya, then Georgia, then assassinating his opponents on British soil with a dangerous radioactive poison that killed a British citizen and injured at least one other, then funding and arming separatist fighters in Donbass, then shooting down a passenger plane, then annexing Crimea, then progressing from funding separatists in Donbas to actually sending Russian military to help them, then incredible amounts of violence and indiscriminate killing of civilians in Syria (oh and torturing people to death there, videos are on Youtube).

Testing the west to see how much further he can go, and each time the west barely does anything, at worst they put mild sanctions on Russia. Now a full scale invasion of Ukraine because, in Putin's own words, it isn't a real country, doesn't deserve to exist, is rightfully a part of Russia, and threatening nuclear destruction of the west as he invades it. 

These are the actions of a dangerous man, of whom there have been many throughout history, and he needs to be stopped. If that means arming Ukraine to the tune of billions of dollars then that's how it be, as long as they're willing to keep on fighting of course, which they seem to be, and I don't blame them.

Had his invasion worked and Ukraine had fallen within a few days as seemed to be the Russian plan (lol), then I guarantee you the next target would be Moldova which ""isn't a real country and actually belongs to Russia.""

106,[],False,,Mercbeast,,,,,,"You're welcome to your opinion. I bet you thought this would take weeks. I thought it would take months if not longer.

I think people either grossly under estimate, the effectiveness of modern manpads and atgms when they can be utilized properly. The reason I suspected this conflict would be slow and brutal is because I took my queues on what to expect from 2006 Israel/Hezbollah (Lebanon) war. What a motivated force with modern ATMGs could do to modern MBTs made it clear that if Ukraine was motivated to fight, the cost to advance would be atrociously high for Russia.

Iraq had geographic, as well as systemic institutional problems that made it 1) Not only difficult to actually operate against a foe that had near 24/7 real time intelligence on your movements. Also 2) geography that is wipe out, with few natural barriers, or any real overhead cover.

These two factors contributed to how easy it was for coalition air power to decapitate command and control, and then to isolate and bypass Iraqi strong points whenever possible. On top of that, the Iraqi people were not that motivated to stand up in the conventional phase (for good reason, see the two factors I just listed as reason why it wasn't a good idea). 

Ukraine has been armed with NATO intelligence. They've been armed with thousands of modern manpads and atgms of nato make. They outnumber the Russian invasion significantly. The geography of the country offers many, many natural barriers in rivers that bisect the country N/S. It also, while not forested by say Canadian standards, still offers areas of heavy forestation that become strong points for Ukrainian defenses (read manpads).

So I'm not sure what exactly you're disagreeing with here. Is it that I don't think Iraq can be considered a peer to the USA? I mean, obviously they are not. Is it because I think Ukraine is relatively close to being a peer to Russia due to the level of commitment Russia has made to this invasion? Similar doctrine. Similar equipment. Russia has more heavy weapons. Ukraine has more manpower fighting. Etc? Basically it's kind of a wash.

Or is it because I don't think the USA could conquer Ukraine as easily as it conquered Iraq? Considering Ukraine is 2x larger than Iraq. With a larger population. With a highly motivated population. With more modern weapons, training, and it is bristling to the teeth with modern manpads and atgms that are the IDEAL weapon system for a country like Ukraine to inflict maximum damage to a country like the USA, or Russia for that matter.

How many aircraft do you think were shot down by Iraq or the Taliban by manpads? One in Afghanistan. Maybe a few in Iraq. That should tell you 1) about the prevelence of manpads in Afghanistan and Iraq, and 2) how conducive the terrain was to utilizing them effectively in Iraq.

Next, let's talk about how the air defense grid in Ukraine is significantly more dangerous than the one in Iraq. Iraq, as far as I can tell, he 1960s-1970s vintage SAMS of various types, as well as anti-air guns and a limited number of older soviet era manpads. The Ukrainians have access to several S300 batteries. These are long range stand off anti-air missile systems that are far better than anything Iraq had. These are designed to engage large numbers of high altitude aircraft. 

The existence of the S300 in Ukraine is what is driving the Russians to engage in low altitude sorties. Which is what pushes them into the range of the wide range of modern nato manpads Ukraine has. It's why we're seeing the Russians engage more and more in less orthodox stand off type deliveries. IE Helicopters engaging in indirect rocket attacks. Stuff like that.

Could the USAF operate better than the RUAF? Absolutely. No question. Would they have complete operational freedom in Ukraine the way they had in Afghanistan and Iraq? No. Not even fucking close. The US lost more than a hundred, or hundreds of helicopters, almost EXCLUSIVELY to small arms fire, and or lucky RPG-7 hits. They lost a relatively signficant number of fixed wing aircraft as well to small arms (relatively significant means they shouldn't have lost any fixed wing to small arms). The Taliban according to the CIA, had maybe 100 stingers left from the Soviet war. Of which it is unclear how many were still operational. US sources claim that only one helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan by a manpad (if I recall correctly, there is a wiki page that goes over aircraft losses in Afghanistan). That means they barely had any in the field. Iraq, going by memory, had I think on paper around 300? Iglas or Strelas? Which is a 1960/70's Soviet era manpad. I'm not sure if there was a single recorded manpad kill in Iraq. I'm not as familiar with those numbers. I don't think it was very many. Simply put, they were not very effective there, nor were they avaliable in large numbers well into the conflict. I believe Iran smuggled a small number of manpads into Iraq at some point as well. 

Ukraine on the otherhand, has presumably thousands at this point. That are sitting under an integrated, dangerous, anti-air umbrella depending on how much of the S300 grid is still alive. The S300 makes high altitude operations dangerous, and the manpads make low altitude operations dangerous. If Iraqis and Taliban shot down hundreds of Helicopters with AKs RPKs PKMs and Doushkas, what the fuck do you think Ukrainians would do with startreaks, stingers, etc? 

It took the US, with a larger force than Russia brought, 5 weeks to conclude the ""conventional"" phase of the war, in a country that was tailor made to magnify the strengths of western military power. Against an army that was woefully under equipped, and unmotivated to fight outside of a few edge cases.

Ukraine is bigger, more populous, with better defensive terrain, with better weapons, training and motivation. You really think the US would have conquered Ukraine by now if it took a force similar in size to the one Russia invaded with?

If you are talking about a Chinese invasion of hawaii, yes US will easily win, chinese navy and armed forces aren’t built for that.

A limited battle in Korea where US does not strike targets in China for fear of escalating to nuclear war? That will be a tough battle for the US. China has far greater manufacturing capacity and far greater manpower. China is already the worlds largest producer of drones and ships and chips (just not high end gpu/cpus). They can turn their whole manufacturing capacity to total war. And their total capacity is far larger than US. And the question is, in this scenario, would the US chose to enter total war for korea? We don’t know.

A war in taiwan? It depends on what Chinas war strategy is. If China wants to take the islands with little damage to infrastructure, it is going to have a hard time landing. But they can chose to turn the whole island of taiwan into a mariupole, a smoking ruin inhospitable to any life without using a single ship.

There is no difference in survivability.

If there is a reactive artillery duel (not that this really makes any sense as there are different doctrines) the Soviet equipment would win by virtue of having twice the range (GMLRS-ER is still in development, while 9M554 series has already been used in wartime) and being able to deliver three times the ordnance before reloading. Sustained fire rated are roughly equal - Soviet equipment takes twice as long to reload but carries twice as many (larger) munitions.

Very long range MLRS isn't a serious concern for the US, and generally the US wasn't very keen on using such a weapon.

They had the fourth largest army in the world at the time, and one of the most sophisticated and covered air defense networks in the world outside a great power. The Iraqi Air Force had more jets than the Ukrainian Air Force at the start of the war, and these were pretty decent jets at the time too. And the Republican Guard wasn't a joke; they'd just got out of a brutal war vs Iran so there were plenty of battle hardened and motivated soldiers. The Iraqis had plenty of handheld manpads and shorad as well, but manpads are basically useless against high flying jets using precision guided weapons. 

If the USAF was in charge of an air war against Ukraine, it would establish air superiority over Ukraine about as easily as it did over Iraq and Kuwait. Stingers and Iglas literally can't reach fighter jets unless they lower their altitude. There are many problems with the way the VKS operated that explains why they had trouble with air superiority, and none of them apply to the USAF. Here are some of them:

* Most Russian pilots have less than 100 flight hours a year. American pilots are the most experienced in the world. 
* Russians have bad IFF and can't tell the difference between Russian and Ukrainian jets. American jets have much better IFF due to fighting multiple wars in which the biggest threat to aircraft was friendly fire. 
* Russians are running out of precision guided munitions. The American arsenal is for all practical purposes a bottomless pit.
* Running out of PGMs is why Russian jets are getting down low and getting shot down on their bombing runs. You don't hear Ukrainians shooting down their strategic bombers launching cruise missiles, because those start safely out of range... like all American jets would because there is no shortage of PGMs in the USAF. 
* Russians have little to no experience with SEAD. It's pretty much all the Americans practiced for decades.
* Russians can't jam communication space because their ground troops rely on enemy civilian networks to communicate with each other.
* Russians couldn't upgrade their jets because of sanctions.

And it's not like the USAF hasn't improved since the Gulf War. Widespread use of drones for CAS would further reduce casualties. A much more developed helicopter doctrine means we probably aren't going to throw them into contested airspace like we did back then. 

Ground combat would be much more difficult, especially urban combat. Because that's where motivation and terrain really come into play. But the Russians are actively losing artillery duels and even some open set piece battles against the Ukrainians. That just wouldn't happen with a military that has air superiority.",ce3aa9be4aed3e3c2e99012c27b2a065b3dc6b43,True,False,,,,,0,1653520907,,0,{},i9zzjwd,False,t3_uxo7qs,False,True,t1_i9zp0r3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxo7qs/ukrainian_mechanized_infantry_escaping_russian/i9zzjwd/,1653520925,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653492107.0,[],text,t2_anapr,False,True,

Still I accept that just because the logic is faulty, doesn't mean Russia isn't still following it. It reminds me of Russia's well known war plan against NATO to quickly seize the Baltics and a land connection to Kaliningrad before the full might of NATO's massive armies arrives, and use the captured territory as a bargaining chip in peace negotiations. An equally nonsensical plan that requires their adversary to have no brain function.

&gt;I don’t think time is in Ukraine’s favor, the more this war last, the more Ukraine will be destroyed and more pressure for the government to reach a deal. Russia is already in deep shit, dhe sanctions will not go away even if the war ends, so it makes sense for them to reach their limited objectives at least.

The reason time is in Ukraine's favour is that a) Russia is losing equipment day by day while Ukraine is gaining equipment, b) Russia is on the verge of economic collapse that will compromise their capacity to wage war, c) Putin's government will likely be overthrown if the situation continues to deteriorate

Ukraine faces little pressure to negotiate. Their economy is probably in as bad a shape as it can be, and they're getting massive economic support from the West. Their morale is high because they defend their homeland. North Vietnam never broke even though they were hit far harder by the US.

I really don't see a way for Russia to win here unless Ukraine just sort of agrees that Russia has won. They can absorb tremendous losses if need be, and just decide that they still won't quit, and Russia has no answer to that. This encirclement, even if a total, unmitigated success (and I suspect that even if they succeed in encircling a large force, they still have all the work ahead of them to reduce and eliminate the pocket) only really removes a fraction of Ukraine's ever increasing warfighting capability.",3bb54dfe7028746bc944a1a9221c31528fbfe86a,True,False,,,,,0,1653520771,,0,{},i9zz906,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t1_i9zv72i,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9zz906/,1653520789,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653491971.0,[],text,t2_bp7tg,False,True,

&gt; Don’t get me wrong, the individual competence of soldiers, particularly NCO’s and CO’s, is incredibly important, especially in the sorts of conflicts the west has been involved with in the last few decades, but assuming a generally decent level of competence on both sides technological and strategic/logistical factors are far more relevant. Those are the reasons NATO is by far the most powerful military force on the planet, not because the average US grunt is more used to getting shot at than the average Chinese one

Ever since the Chinese Civil War, large indépendance of COs and NCOs has been characteristic, going as far as allowing them to disobey direct orders and be commended for it.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, this is the only way they were able to do so well in the civil war and Korean war. By anyone's prediction the PLA should have gotten wrecked.
&gt; 
&gt; The Chinese military is nothing like the Russian/Soviet one. People associate them, but they have a very different culture and organisation

The PLA reneged on low level initiative after the Korean war, due to purges and losses.

Their losses in the Korean War basically destroyed their entire army reserved for amphibious assault of Taiwan.

After some of Mao's purges, China went back to actual human wave tactics, as opposed to infiltration warfare.

See: Sino-Vietnamese war. Where a force that is numerically superior, equipped with superior firepower, couldn't even take on Vietnamese militia forces. The Chinese advanced in a line, shoulder to shoulder.

A single Vietnamese 50% understrength platoon held up a Chinese regiment. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cao_Ba_Lanh

The modern PLA is the same PLA as it was in the Sino-Vietnamese war, but with better equipment, and even worse morale.

Third, it endangers the whole UA defenses on the Donesk oblast line (which is the next target of the Russian Army). That’s why it’s quite a significant development. 

Personally, I think Russia is trying to wrap up things in Donbas before the new batch of high tech US arms arrives in the front line, which may tip the wave, or turn the front in a stalemate. I think the current goal of Russia is to take the whole Donbas (Donetsk and Luhansk) and then dig in.

Ukraine was not supposed to be a military peer to Russia, either. Russian Air Force was 65x larger. Russia had mountains of long-range assets that Ukraine could not match. Russia had a navy and Ukraine had some patrol boats and one frigate. 

&gt;In a hypothetical situation, if the US had invaded Ukraine in 2022 with the same size force as Russia, they'd be bogged down too. 

No, it wouldn't. Why did the invasion fail? Not for any one tactical reason, but because Russian intelligence was unable to provide the commanders (including Putin) a realistic idea of what Ukrainian society was like, so they assumed that Czechoslovakia '68 redux was realistic. For all its flaws, US intelligence has never failed this spectacularly. 

&gt;Thousands of dead, maybe more than 10,000.

Extremely unlikely. 

&gt;They'd be losing aircraft left and right. Tanks left and right. 

Even more unlikely. 

&gt;They wouldn't have uncontested control of the air space. 

There would not be a single Ukrainian aircraft left flying. Big area denial SAMs would probably be operating as they did in Serbia- ie without the ability to reliably deny airspace to the USAF and USN. 

&gt;The heavy reliance on CAS would be problematic because of the prevelence of capable manpads EVERYWHERE.  


The US has spent the last 30 years learning to conduct CAS above MANPADS range. 

The RuAF cannot. Why? One, it cannot conduct SEAD and Air Superiority well enough to allow its aircraft to operate at high altitude, and two, PGM stocks are miniscule, so RuAF mostly cannot hit anything if it operates at high altitude. There is no Russian answer to SDB or Brimstone. 

&gt;Comparing Iraq, which is like, the best case scenario for western military power to flex (desert, massive visibility, an unmotivated conventional enemy, a big, but largely toothless barely modern military that looks scary on paper)

January '91 was anything but high visibility. Aircraft were grounded for bad weather quite often. 

Iraqi military only broke the way it did because the US was able to cut Iraqi units off from supplies and higher command and keep them cut off for weeks. It remained functional for 8 years of war against Iran, even though it sustained \~200k KIA. 

&gt;Iraq had limited modern ATGMs. Limited modern manpads. Antique RPGs.

They were quite capable at the time, even if they're outdated now.

494,[],False,,faguzzi,,,,,,"Just so we’re clear, frequency hopping isn’t a panacea. Russia can, for example, maybe probably jam sincgars (Not that it has **any** bearing on the actual discussion we’re having which regards, specifically, whether or not jamming is a partial countermeasure to *loitering munitions*, that’s it. This isn’t a discussion about the EMS in general or our thoughts about the general direction of EW which is by definition a pain in the ass to find open source information about and not even relevant to the subject at hand):

&gt; Part of this shift is due to what was a reduced EW threat. The swift defeat of the iraqi army, the waning military power of russia during the 1990s and the rapid toppling of saddam hussein in 2003 made security on the electromagnetic spectrum seem like an afterthought. However, the belief that SINCGARS could elude modern enemy jammers, as surmised in fm 11-1, is inaccurate. Even before the full fielding of SINCGARS in 1987, scholars were voicing the concern that it was still vulnerable to eW capabilities. A 1986 monograph bemoaned that procurement of SINCGARS radios was underway “despite the fact that it is now known that they are just as vulnerable to the new jammers as are single channel radios.”105 While sincgars can elude more primitive electronic sensors, today’s computer-assisted jammers and direction finders can ascertain the pattern of frequency-hopping radios. With these advances in EW technology, frequency-hopping radios now stand out due to their emission of unique and sporadic “frequencies at a single location.”106 After determining the hop pattern, “a follower jammer could be assigned to the frequency associated with that location—thereby jamming every hop” of that radio.107 frequency-hopping radios still have an advantage over analog eW equipment, but the improvements in EW technology have made them easier (instead of more difficult) to identify when surrounded by non-military transmissions in single frequency.

&gt; The U.S. army treats eW as an afterthought— more of an impediment to operations than an enabler.108 However, the russian military gives eW high priority.109 Today, each Russian maneuver brigade has its own EW company, while U.S. battalions will have only two EW personnel.110 russia has sophisticated communication eW systems such as the r-330B very- high frequency (VHF) jamming and direction-finding system (see figure 7) that can detect and jam frequency- hopping emitters at up to 300 times per second (enough to keep up with sincGars and similar systems). it can also get a bearing on an emitter direction within three degrees of accuracy, and it has a detection-to-suppression time of less than five milliseconds.111 In a situation where access to satcom is denied, use of VHF for data and voice traffic will likely rise, leaving U.S. forces vulnerable to detection and triangulation with such systems as the r-330B.

About Russia in particular:

&gt; EW jamming systems supplied to Western MD over the past three years included the Zhitel R-330Zh automated jammer, operating in the 100–2,000 MHz frequency band, with a range for communications intelligence collection and communications jamming of up to 15 km for ground targets and up to 200 km for airborne targets. During Exercise Union Shield 2015, a joint military exercise with Belarus, the **Zhitel complex was used to jam a simulated enemy’s UAVs.**

https://icds.ee/wp-content/uploads/2018/ICDS_Report_Russias_Electronic_Warfare_to_2025.pdf

&gt; State trials of the new EW system, the Shipovnik-AERO, developed by OPK, ended in 2017. **The system is intended to combat an enemy’s UAVs by attacking its control transmission, but is also able to locate where the UAV’s control signal is transmitted from. The system provides different solutions for attacking the UAVs. One is to first analyse the control signal, then suppress and replace it, thereby taking control of the UAV. Another is to force the UAV down by creating an area with fake navigation signals (GPS).** The system can also attack cell phone communications, as well as Wi-Fi and Wimax networks (Telekanal Zvezda 2017b).

More about Russia specifically:

&gt; In recent years, Moscow has made significant progress in purchasing and developing EW capacity across its Armed Forces branches and service arms. Objectives for the Il-22PP Porubshchik EW aircraft include its ability to silence any radio transmissions, air defense radars, early warning aircraft, air command posts, and ground communication centers. **It disrupts the radio traffic of tactical and strategic aircraft, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconnaissance (Spezio, 2002; McDermott, 2017).**

&gt;The Krasukha-4 EW ground complex blocks GPS transmissions within a 300-kilometer radius. The communication channels used to transfer information have no barriers to jamming. **Not only will the technology on this future platform have to efficiently jam AWACS aircraft, manned and unmanned aircraft**, air defense systems, ground equipment, and signals from the enemy’s satellite grouping, it will also have to jam signals from the enemy’s satellite grouping.

&gt;The Russian Krasukha-2 system can analyze signal kinds and then jam an adversary’s radar. The capacity of Russia to spoof signals is a unique characteristic of Krasukha-2. When an actor imitates, or “spoofs,” authentic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in order to alter positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data, this is referred to as spoofing. Spoofing is generally done by providing fake positional information to an attacker. Russia intentionally emits the identical signals on GNSS frequencies to prevent receivers from locking on to the genuine GNSS signals (Kjellén, 2018).

&gt;**Borisoglebsk-2 is best known for its participation in eastern Ukraine, where it is said to have hampered the use of Ukrainian drones by blocking incoming GPS signals.**

Regardless, I don’t even see the point of what we’re disputing? The article you cited, the same one I linked to with the quoted section btw, says that jamming is part of a layered defense to loitering munitions. That’s my entire claim, jamming/EW is a **partial countermeasure** to loitering munitions. To say I’m wrong means that you’re claiming it’s entirely useless. Every major military is investing in EW/Jamming capabilities to counter UAVs and LMs, but they’re all wasting money because your personal experience says that jamming in general is just useless??????? Do you dispute the author’s claim? Fine, you’re entitled to do that. You seem to think I was claiming it was a complete solution to the issue rather than something that maybe probably would be effective depending on circumstance. 

What exactly are you disputing? You’re saying jamming against **small loitering munitions** doesn’t work because something something US army radio com
training and frequency hopping? No? If you think that jamming isn’t useful in **this instance against UAS and small loitering munitions** , you’re entitled to hold that opinion, but you haven’t actually sourced anything, you’ve stated your opinion. You aren’t speaking on the basis of articles sourced from the “academic defense analysis” community, you’re making some wild general claim about the effectiveness of jamming wrt RF communications in general, which, regardless of its accuracy, is wholly irrelevant to your underlying claim that I’m spouting unfounded nonsense about the efficacy of jamming as regards drones. Every source I’ve found says that switchblades, for instance, are susceptible to jamming.

Like what the actual hell are you talking about? Never once did I say that jamming defeats all UAS in general and blocks all RF communications perfectly all the time.

This relates to the chemical mixture with the phosphorus in and the oxygen and nitrogen in the air around it that is what we are seeing here. A chemical reaction. The chemical reaction causes direct damage to the body and internal organs. Thus it should be labeled a chemical weapon. But some countries do use the smoke screen defense (mine cough cough). Buttt the US hands down has the best WP in the world. I don't even need to guess.

So iirc the physical traits and characteristics of this chemical  weapons are horrible. 

So first if you inhale it. Your poop and vomit can glow. (No really it's horrible)

Symptoms are most if not all permanent. 

And if you're within the red zone a you can expect to be dead within 24 to 48 hours due to complete cardio vascular collapse. You burn to death from the inside. Slowly. Red zone b (I could be remembering wrong it could go straight to yellow) but this zone you're chance of survival are also slim. But you can expect minimum second degree burns and third on youre insides. Blindness, seizure due to oxygen being sucked from your lungs. 

The yellow zone, coughing severe burns including second and third degree inside your lungs due to contact with the smoke it produces.

That incompetency has existed since at least Napolean and arguably before in that area of the world against the Swedish and Mongols.

The world is in a strange place and the Ukranian conflict is a microcosm of this, we're in really weird place and anyone skeptical of russias abilities outside of the context of history should read into events like the economies of the west prior to WWI and II, or uprisings like the French Revolution and Napolean's consequential campaigns.

But looking purely at how the land has been divided in the region at the tine when the borders were drawn, how the Kurds number in the tens of millions and were left without a nation of their own as a people.

I believe it was a great injustice.

And saying ""We've successfully integrated most Kurdish people into our country"" doesn't quite sway me.

I'm Slovenian, all that's left of us and our land is the absolute core, everywhere else, our people have been absorbed and made to assimilate. But at least we in the core, get to have our own country and somewhat choose our future as a people ourselves, despite there being only 2 million of us... hence i'm sympathetic to a people that have a population much greater than ours, but were left split up between other nations and without a land of their own, their future always decided by others.

In a hypothetical situation, if the US had invaded Ukraine in 2022 with the same size force as Russia, they'd be bogged down too. Thousands of dead, maybe more than 10,000. They'd be losing aircraft left and right. Tanks left and right. They wouldn't have uncontested control of the air space. The heavy reliance on CAS would be problematic because of the prevelence of capable manpads EVERYWHERE. 

Comparing Iraq, which is like, the best case scenario for western military power to flex (desert, massive visibility, an unmotivated conventional enemy, a big, but largely toothless barely modern military that looks scary on paper). Iraq was the perfect country to demonstrate Western military power.

Iraq had limited modern ATGMs. Limited modern manpads. Antique RPGs. A corrupt and ineffective general staff/officer corps/NCO corps. An extremely low level of morale in the army in general. A country that didn't really give a shit about the country as a whole and had more regional/tribal/religious loyalties. The country is a desert giving an opponent that relies so heavily on airpower an even larger force multiplier. 

Again hypothetical. How much more dangerous are a half dozen Ukrainians in a heavy forest with a Kornet waiting to ambush a tank convoy, than a half dozen Iraqs in a wadi with a Kornet waiting to ambush a tank convoy? Considering that it's almost impossible to spot the Ukrainians from the air unless you luck out and look directly at them through a hole in the canopy.

You can see this developing in how Donbas has played out the last few weeks. The initial axis of Russian advance was out of Izium in the North, and along that axis in the south to link up with the Izium front. This was the obvious play for Russia, and Ukraine prepared well for it. They re-deployed a significant portion of their forces to ring these likely offensive points. It made progress very slow and difficult for the Russians. So they pivoted away. Now we're seeing relatively rapid and problematic Russian gains around Popasna. The Russians breached the main line of Ukrainian resistance at Popasna. This breach threatened large sections of the Ukrainian MLR north and south of Popasna, and the Ukrainians retreated the units they could out of the threatened areas. Which allowed Russia to take big chunk of territory to the south with limited resistance. Which puts Bahmut in danger of being encircled on 2 sides, and potentially on 3 if the northern front is able to close the distance on it.

Basically, Ukraine has shown that with their numbers, they can stop Russian advances. However, they need to be in position for that, and Russia is now hitting in 2-3 places at once, and then following up the successes. The moment Ukraine finishes redeploying to plug that gap, Russia shifts to a new area. Ukraine seems to be chasing shadows in Donbas now.",5a2b3c58dda2879b5174c5a543d76edb1b335e3a,True,False,,,,,0,1653514772,,0,{},i9zlymr,False,t3_uwwwkw,False,True,t1_i9wv593,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uwwwkw/russian_media_embedded_with_syrias_elite/i9zlymr/,1653514790,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653485972.0,[],text,t2_npfym,False,False,True

Just my opinion but I think most people have a stake in this war, or will have at some point, even if they don’t feel it right now. I’m glad you feel emotionally neutral because that is a lot less stressful.

Case in point. I quickly scanned the headline of this video and wrongly assumed this was a Ukrainian attack on Russian military. After 3 months of Russian atrocities I felt pretty much nothing for the men getting blown up other than….well….who cares about them? Not me.

Now I’ve read the comments I know it’s Ukrainians getting blown up and I feel a bit nauseous. Not just because people are getting killed for defending their own country but because I’m apparently pro murder as long as Russians are dying.

My recollection from the war at the time was, the reports were that due to the number of KO'd tanks, and the Israeli aversion to KIA, the tank column would have to stop, and hunker down to allow for the protection of recovery teams. This put more tanks at risk. The column basically stopped moving because of this, and losses began to mount. In the face of this, and some other general failures regarding the command of their armored forces. Israel decided to end things. I believe part of this decision was based on how quickly tank losses were ramping up. It was felt that the attrition rate on tanks, knocked out and destroyed was too high to sustain for a length of time. This was a month long conflict, but from my recollection, most of the armored forces were only deployed towards the end. In that time they lost 20+ out of 300 tanks in a matter of days and I'm not sure that figure counted mobility kills that would take the tank out of operation for awhile, potentially putting more tanks at risk.

Returning to Lebanon. Yes, the tanks could have just yeeted forwards and left their knocked out tanks behind. They didn't though. Which played into Hezbollahs hands. Where they would allow the Israelis to drive past their positions, and then engage them in what was essentially 360 degree ambush after 360 degree ambush. Hitting them from all directions with RPG-29s, Kornets, Metis', Konkurs and Fagots.

Specifically referring to the 401st armored brigade that attempted the assault into Wadi Saluki during the closing days of the war. It was a cluster fuck, you can read about it if you like.

Then they could kill all of them, but threat in guerilla warfare is mobility. Enemy could just relocate to positions that these 30 men could hold off until whole grid turns into a living base. There would be no point of fighting for the grid. These 3 have 9 more friends elsewhere. 9 more people to control the ground, 9 more variables to prevent another ambush. The hunter gets hunted. It's a trade-off. 


This is why there's almost always a certain death against unconventional warfare. It's just too uncertain. If you don't control the ground, the enemy will move in and gain control by simply walking into the grid. Spreading men to create multiple bases and outposts, then turning these points into a point of control worked for the Turkish army in the end. It's like a castle made out of thick meat. You may chip it, but once you lose control over that point it's over for you. You cannot possibly outcontrol an entire grid compromised of reinforcements. This meat wall moved one step at a time, pinching them into their very home. Now PKK has nowhere left to run. 

Hesitation causes further loses. See Afghanistan. US had the air, but they hauled their men into one place for too long. You killed Taliban and took over control? Then how can you be sure that you took control if you don't spread your men? Getting your countrymen killed gets you unpopular in politics. There's that for US. 

In Turkey, death in fighting is seen as your way to heaven, to fight and eat with once great leaders. Quite common against countries with tribalistic/shamanistic culture. It has Islamic side to it as well. Another doctrine is that you die so that another brother can live and avenge you.

 338 Lapua Magnum however is being used in what we would recognise as a   
traditional sniper role.

That's me saying the SVD is being used as a Designated Marksman's Rifle and the SV-98 is being used as what would be recognised as a sniper rifle. I covered this earlier when I said

&gt;In addition where Snipers were previously considered a long range single  
 shot asset in Western forces they have increasingly become applied to   
shorter range roles.

Very high accuracy bolt action long range rifles are what have been typically associated with Sniper roles in the Western world. This isn't an opinion it's a fact.

An SVD would not be recognised as a sniper rifle in the same manner as Western Sniper Rifles are recognised. That again is just a fact. 

&gt;and camouflage it by weird take on 'it just comes down to interpretation of what a Sniper is

But again it simply is a fact that what a sniper is has been viewed very differently through history. If you can't accept that opinions on specific roles, training and equipment vary then that's on you. [A simple wikipedia search would tell you this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper#Military_doctrine).  


&gt;lament about Ukraine not disclosing causality numbers in the middle of   
the fucking war and connecting it to cliche of first casuality of war   
being the truth.

Stating a fact that Ukraine has been very tight on casualties is not ""lamenting"". It's just accepting a simple truth, and it's not an overused term to say that the first casualty of war is the truth.

In any case, the idea that “The ability to confuse or jam missile guidance systems is already well established.” applies to RADAR jamming or to dazzling IR detectors. It does not apply as a cure all to laser comms or RF comms or other non-RF comms. 

If you have ever trained with a full spectrum jamming environment, you’ll know that RF jamming doesn’t work to totally defeat voice comms while freq hopping. Millions of people know this from training, by personal experience. In the US, we train everyone in the army about this, to at least a small extent. Jamming works even less when the system is hopping on two different antennas, sending two data sets that can be checked against each other. Jamming is NOT a panacea. It is actually a waste of R&amp;D dollars. If it worked so well, why are the Thales we see on Ukrainian’s vests still working? If you won’t take personal experiences, I understand fully and a good faith skepticism is warranted. If you won’t take real world proof, that we see on this sub daily, I don’t understand why you wouldn’t. 

The most real world jamming successes have been against COTS drones, not purpose built systems. There were some suspected instances vs the TB2s in Syria, but nothing I’ve seen shows they are running modern comms. Eg They are not dual frequency freq hopping.

No, they absolutely don’t. NATO poses no threat to them whatsoever, and will not for the foreseeable future. Geographic position means absolutely nothing. Every other country on Earth could join NATO except Russia and it still wouldn’t change a single thing; namely, that NATO is not going to invade Russia and will not so long as it has nukes.

What concern is it of Russia’s who Ukraine is allied with? Again, Russia need fear no invasion whatsoever. That ended the day they got the Bomb. 

&gt;And yes I believe whataboutism is a liberal tool to maintain moral authority. 

So, to clarify, do you believe that liberals use whataboutism as a tactic to maintain moral authority, i.e. they justify their own actions by deflecting to the real or imagined actions of other countries, or do you believe that whataboutism itself is an accusation that liberals levy against others, but is actually perfectly sound moral reasoning? Because if it’s the latter, I’m afraid that I have to inform you that whataboutism is quite literally a logical fallacy, more properly known as the *argumentum ad hominem tu quoque.* Essentially, it is the fallacious defensive claim that people and countries make that an argument against them is invalid, not because the argument itself is wrong, but because the person or entity making the argument has engaged in that behavior themselves. In essence, it is making excuses for one’s own behavior by pointing fingers at others, and whether or not those accusations are accurate or proportional is entirely incidental to the question of whether the person pointing those fingers is in the right themselves.

&gt;The bottom line is Nato have expanded to places they agreed not to, 

This is complete BS, by the way. NATO is a voluntary military alliance, and they have not in any official statement or treaty declared any country off the table for NATO membership. Quite unlike Russia, which has several times violated treaties regarding Ukraine’s sovereignty and borders.

Big thing to watch for in the next 72 is whether or not Ukraine can successfully pull out and reorganize with enough manpower left for a future counter attack in the area, or if enough guys get caught in the pocket that Ukraine ends up with high losses as well. 

Anyway, looks like these guys are part of the teams that got out of the pocket.",560cd4c62c103b6d12d8c851018b54b37ca03902,True,False,,,,,0,1653513290,,0,{},i9ziio2,False,t3_uxo7qs,False,True,t1_i9zauaz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxo7qs/ukrainian_mechanized_infantry_escaping_russian/i9ziio2/,1653513304,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653484490.0,[],text,t2_kklh2yad,False,False,

It's about the doctrine. Many soldiers in one spot is invitation for a bigger attack, possibly with ATGMs. Judging by the track record of 2018, meanwhile this fight was happening, there was another fight that ended with Turkish victory elsewhere. It's the way to fight unconventional enemies. This is what makes Turkey superior to others, too. Ukraine wrecked Russia because they knew the unconventional/conventional manuevers. I don't think majority of NATO could hold Russia off if they were to fight. Ukraine has the experience of Turkey. 

""Only 3 guys up the hill"" would secure that mountain for good. If not, how could Turkey pushed PKK into Qandil? Did they just give up? It's a trade-off that soldiers and military heads are willing to make. Otherwise, no point of controlling a base in nowhere with 30 men. That 30 men can hold 10 smaller outposts, and then turn entire grid into a literally moving base with additional support. Getting infiltrated into your base would be the real embarresment. Coalition hesitation to make soldiers work is the main reason why US lost against Taliban. If you don't control the ground, there's no point to hold off the skies. Not like PKK or Taliban has planes.

Tho I don't think forces from Mariupol would have changed things drastically. As I said the most crucial thing for Ukraine is not keeping Sdonets or that small segment of JFO but buying time. Time to get their troops ready, time to get more weapons from lend lease in.

Russia is dwarfed by NATO numerically in every way and China is only ahead in terms of population and industry so not sure what you’re on about with “even with their numbers.”, though I suppose it’s a trend with a certain subset of people to diminish a countries military prowess by banging on about them relying on hordes of shit tier units. 

Regardless, in a large scale conventional war with China, and to a lesser extent Russia given the greater relevance of ground combat in such a conflict, squad level tactics like this would be a minuscule factor. It’s impossible to truly tell how well the Chinese military would stand up to a high intensity conventional war, their military simply has not been tested, though I suppose the same could be said for everyone outside of Ukraine and Russia given the last time a war like this occurred was over 30 years ago. 

Don’t get me wrong, the individual competence of soldiers, particularly NCO’s and CO’s, is incredibly important, especially in the sorts of conflicts the west has been involved with in the last few decades, but assuming a generally decent level of competence on both sides technological and strategic/logistical factors are far more relevant. Those are the reasons NATO is by far the most powerful military force on the planet, not because the average US grunt is more used to getting shot at than the average Chinese one",1210a1fafedce31cd6f0ab7ead209eea9f814777,True,False,,,,,0,1653511892,,0,{},i9zf775,False,t3_uxo7qs,False,True,t1_i9za3zm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxo7qs/ukrainian_mechanized_infantry_escaping_russian/i9zf775/,1653511904,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653483092.0,[],text,t2_633wu4dy,False,False,

I will only refer to few, and dont't get me wrong - I don't mean to be rude in any way.

You are using a lot of terms, names of systems, tactics etc but one can tell it is heavily influenced by whatever narratives media are pushing at the given time.

1. Well, it sounds great and impressive, but one have to open ones eyes and look at overall situation.  I will put as simply as I can. Western estimate mid april was 20-30k overall. So you can add another 10k by now at least. Plus 4-7k POW's. And that may be conservative.  
2. . I didn't call it a fluke, but pushing back token fixing force from  this area hardly is a success that will influence any future outcomes. And people saying that ""if this offensive goes further east it will isolate RF Izyum front or whatever"" obviously didn't look at the map. Its over for the time being anyway,

9. Not much logic on this one. So if UA have 32 battalions there, and it is easiest part, why not do it and free, say 20 of them to go somwhere else?

12. No, it wasn't any succes. Forces wasted there, were of much more use on ie. Donbass front. N and NE  RF clusterfucks of fronts were not going anywhere, that was obvious probably mid march, There is absolutely no narrative, that will convinceme  me that geting 4-5k professional troops + whatever number of auxiliaries killed or captured was a strategic necessity.

13. Everyone that has any clue, will tell you that final outcome can not be predicted at this moment. There are external factors that are more important that situation on the front.",6417bc6b7cc463354d3a3ff0025780e1f7c54a66,True,False,,,,,0,1653511511,,0,{},i9zea6b,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t1_i9yis3q,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9zea6b/,1653511526,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653482711.0,[],text,t2_g7h7d1h4,False,False,

Read what I said again. I didn’t say that spacing doesn’t matter at all and that you should bunch up. My point is that dispersal doesn’t matter all that much as a squad sized force when receiving accurate artillery fire. More important is the availability of nearby cover, not getting spotted in the first place, and in the case of loitering munitions having technical countermeasures.",0ed646785dfb23c152ef0c20247d0e8693151074,True,False,,,,,0,1653511502,,0,{},i9ze9dj,False,t3_uxllx0,False,True,t1_i9yv0pv,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxllx0/the_work_of_the_russian_kamikaze_uav_cube_on_the/i9ze9dj/,1653511517,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653482702.0,[],text,t2_z0ms5,False,False,

Was that supposed to be a self-demonstrating joke? *But what about the liberals! That’s their thing! It’s okay when the Soviets and Tankies do it because it’s liberal!*

&gt;and the only reason Iraq was mentioned, was me trying to look at the situation from both sides. 

The two sides are Ukraine and Russia. Iraq isn’t even a tertiary involvement here.

&gt;If America is expanding its power/influence ever closer to Russias border, they have every right to feel threatened. 

Of course they don’t have a right to feel threatened. NATO has never once threatened to or actually invaded Russia. The Russians are *well* aware that they have nukes, and thus that NATO would never even try. Russia is a country full of uneducated drunken hicks with an appalling life expectancy and yet I still would not expect anyone there but the village idiot to *sincerely* believe the propaganda line that Russia’s aggression is defensive in nature due to NATO posing some kind of threat to them.

&gt;Now I mentioned the Middle East only to point out that if America and its allies can invade and destroy a sovereign country, without any justification, without UN sanction, then I understand how they could be seen as a threat. 

The difference is that Iraq didn’t have nukes. It’s that simple. Nukes change the game completely, more than any other factor. Plus, although the United States invoked Article 5 following 9/11, NATO did not actually send in any forces into Iraq, though they did send troops into Afghanistan.

If equipment used by specific groups is seen in Mariupol it is not a stretch to infer they may be present.

It is not unusual to use the evidence of the presence of something and the refusal to say if something was there to put 2 + 2 together and consider the potential outcomes of this. As was clearly assessed from both ends:

[https://mymodernmet.com/first-photograph-photography-history/](https://mymodernmet.com/first-photograph-photography-history/)).  


The first motion picture cameras didn't come along until the mid 1800s, and they were limited to recording scientific experiments. The first real motion camera as we'd imagine it would've came about in 1889 (the Kinetograph, which used 35mm film, the same film you'd get in those single use cameras you'd take on holidays when you were young in the 90's/00's).

&gt; In terms of “Soft kill” APS solutions. **The ability to confuse or jam missile guidance systems is already well established**. However, interrupting a data connection to a loitering munition in flight is likely to be difficult for individual vehicles until the threat is very close, by which time it may be too late. Consequently, longer-range soft kills may require something like a high energy laser. These are still immature, but technology in this space is advancing quickly. A better approach to “soft kill” systems may be offensive EW from forward deployed reconnaissance units tasked with searching for loitering munition launchers.

&gt;Used in conjunction, the above systems have the potential to create a layered counter-UAV, counter-loitering munitions solution:

&gt;Soft kill EW is used to find, track and jam missiles as soon as they are identified.

&gt;Air defence cannons and missiles are than used to engage them, ideally before they commence an attack

&gt;Finally, APS provides a last ditch defence in case the missile gets through.

I’m not “deluded”. If you have some alternative source that says jamming and other EW solutions are completely ineffective against loitering munitions as part of a layered defense, please feel free to enlighten us.",0f172fb3f9c920a0506f81546bc9684e6c766080,True,False,,,,,0,1653509687,,0,{},i9z9srh,False,t3_uxllx0,False,True,t1_i9z64rf,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxllx0/the_work_of_the_russian_kamikaze_uav_cube_on_the/i9z9srh/,1653509703,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653480887.0,[],text,t2_z0ms5,False,False,

The Turks could have won this engagement as the ambush didn't go smoothly as the lead Turk was further ahead and triggered the ambush early and the 2 remaining Turks had a decent piece of cover with that large bolder but seemed to be too scared to utilise that rock to their advantage as instead of pushing onto the rock and using it as cover to fire at the Kurds, they hid behind the rock which allowed the Kurds to push the rock uncontested and use it as cover to finish off the other 2 Turks.   


There are other vids of Turk outposts being ambushed and taken by surprise by similar attacking Kurds of 2/3 man teams and the Turks had no idea until they were right up on their defences. The Turks seem to lack in security or place their outposts in areas that allows for easy ambushes and results in more Turkish deaths.  


Now that all said, this war will not be over any time soon and Turkey will continue to suffer terrorist attacks from the Kurdish groups in the same way the US and allies struggled with the Taliban in Afghanistan and insurgents in Iraq when they tried to stop them.

Ukraine is getting their drones from all over the world. Governments and militaries and civilian groups are sending them in; besides what Ukraine produces. 

&gt;	So, you would rather watch a trained military using drones,

I would rather there be no war. But dictators break international law to start wars and commit war crimes, all of their own volition. It’s not anyones fault but Putin’s that he put an untrained military in the field. But yes, given those circumstances, I would rather watch a trained army like Ukraine’s beating the conscripts of the Russian army.

The Russian conscripts have a choice. Go home or surrender. They don’t have to continue to fight and follow unlawful orders. 

&gt;	which have been so compelled by the Western world to go fight, rather than just admit that your bluff has failed. 

The West has not compelled any Russians to fight. Nor can I think of a single bluff the West has made. The West doesn’t bluff Russia, because Russia is not worthy of our time to think about. It has no power in any capacity, except that comes from the nukes. Not in the UN, not in the G7, not militarily, not anywhere. 

I’ve watched the Russian boomers be built. I’ve studied the work on the Russian ICBM fleet. And that’s the point, Russia only has nukes going for it. The government is worthless. The economy is (literally) worthless. The conventional military is worthless. Putin is a storm in a tea kettle. He can thrash around in his little tin pot, but has no other power. Except to end all humanity in a mass nuclear strike.

&gt;	The west would rather see Ukraine completely destroyed than admit their own fault in this mess.

There is NO risk of Ukraine being completely destroyed. Russia attacked on two fronts and has completly lost the northern one already. In the east, the only thing at risk of being completly destroyed is the Russian military. At this rate, Russia will be completly incapable of defending her own borders in a year. Russia cannnot sustain &lt;4,000 vehicle losses every three months, nor the KIA rates.

If you want to penetrate armor with raw bang power, you would need much more explosives. That means a bigger, heavier weapon.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\_Crimean\_sovereignty\_referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Crimean_sovereignty_referendum)

and the March 1991 USSR wide referendum on saving the country:  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\_Soviet\_Union\_referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_Union_referendum)

In which 71.5% voted to stay in the USSR. This was still during Soviet times, so I would take that entire year with a grain of salt as people just voted YES for anything that the powers be proposed. That is exactly my point, many people woke up shocked to find themselves in a truly independent state. Even when the CIS was announced, it was initially announced as a kind of USSR light with supranational structures, all of which never materialised. So the Ukrainian independence referendum that was held when the USSR still existed, has to be taken in context. People were hungry, store shelves were empty, they would vote YES for anything that promised a better life, but then post 1992, they suddenly sobered up, and thus you see all these separatist tendencies.

&amp;#x200B;

There were also referendums on integrating with Russia in 1994 in the Donbas regions (you will need to google translate it)

We should exercise critical thinking about all sources of media, yes. Not sure why you think this is the ""opposite"" of what I said.

But all sources are not created equal, and all conditions for documentary filmmaking are not created equal. If you've been paying attention to the restrictive laws of free speech, assembly, and the press that have been implemented in Russia in the last few decades, that should be clear to you. Since the start of this war, especially, freedom of the press has been virtually abolished there. State media is basically all that is left inside the country. Anyone who wants to call this war a war without facing criminal charges has to operate outside of Russia, with Russian-language outlets such as Meduza being forced to operate out of Latvia.

Under such conditions, any war reporting coming out of Russia is inherently suspect. That's just a fact.

I don't know how to respond to your comment about documentaries made on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars because it is incredibly vague. Made by who? In which country? At what time? And the thing about living in a society that actually has a free press is, while I'm sure some pretty jingoistic and one-sided stuff has been made about Iraq and Afghanistan, you also have a wide variety of deeply critical films such as *Fahrenheit 9/11* or *Standard Operating Procedure* that are freely released without interference from the government. No one is poisoning or imprisoning Michael Moore for criticizing the Iraq War and the Bush administration. In short, the environments in which Western and Russian war documentaries are made are fundamentally different, and your critical thinking needs to reflect that, or else you are being willfully ignorant.",e12867b92569619101431fc7500d8974493a5317,True,False,,,,,0,1653507066,,0,{},i9z3aei,False,t3_uxj3m5,False,True,t1_i9z0i2x,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxj3m5/compilation_of_videos_of_battles_for_mariupol_a/i9z3aei/,1653507085,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653478266.0,[],text,t2_2hb1oq,False,False,

What worries me much more is the idea of AI systems being built by people who understand them, and then used by people who don't.  The people who don't understand how it works don't understand the limitations and implications of the technology, and thus end up doing bad things through ignorance, not malice.

But ignoring the ignorance aspect and focusing on malice.  His concern about the ethical use of AI is exactly why he is the type of person who should be making AI.  Because he is the type of person who would think it through.  In my experience the people who are building ethically questionable systems either haven't thought through the moral logic of what they're building, or they have rationalized it somehow.  

In every single case I've listed above a concerned coworker raising a point about ethics has tons of potential to make a difference.  And if they get ignored or the finance people try to force you to build something unethical?  Then quit.  It hurts the company you work for more than it hurts you.

""Acoustic Sensors. During flight, drones generate noise both in the audible frequencies and in the ultrasounds. Acoustic sensors reveal the presence of mini-drones as well as helping to classify the target based on noise characteristics specific to the drone model. However, the operational range of acoustic sensors is limited to a few hundred metres. At longer distances, drones are lost in background noise. On the other hand, radars have a blind spot at shorter distances. This means the acoustic sensor, made up of an array of microphones, is the ideal complement to radar systems to cover both long and short ranges. Being relatively cheap, acoustic sensors are efficient tools for the continuous surveillance of particularly sensitive areas.""",d24cdcc10b8ef46da2cee36f9117e750a1b3766d,True,False,,,,,0,1653506698,,0,{},i9z2dyh,False,t3_uxllx0,False,True,t1_i9yj93h,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxllx0/the_work_of_the_russian_kamikaze_uav_cube_on_the/i9z2dyh/,1653506710,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653477898.0,[],text,t2_4g0wv,False,False,

I really question how this could be done, realistically. There's close to 8 billion people in the world, with LOTS of technically adept individuals, whether working on DIY projects or skunk-works projects at the upper-echelons of industry/government. ANY technology which can be used to gain an ethical advantage, can absolutely be used to gain an unethical advantage. 

""Make it illegal to use AI for &lt;x&gt;"", where &lt;x&gt; is some unethical purpose. Sure. So now all we've done is laid out a framework for what to do IF someone does it.. and presumably gets caught. And all someone needs to do is weigh the risk of getting caught being unethical with the personal rewards of doing so. Dealing drugs is illegal (ignoring the progress made on marijuana legalization). Killing people is illegal. Stealing cars is illegal. Those things still all happen all day, every day.

So, I agree with you, you can't stop the development of AI, but for the exact same reason you can't stop people using it unethically, either. And unfortunately, ""ethical"" is very often applied subjectively. ""If it's good for our cause, it's ethical"" is a common unspoken, but still very real, sentiment/justification across all aspects of life... personal relationships, business transactions, warfare, etc. So then we have an additional problem.... who's the arbiter of objective ""ethical use""?",f43c11528d0eb3809b68e0995900def5de2cbce3,True,False,,,,,0,1653503515,,0,{},i9yudvn,False,t3_uxllx0,False,True,t1_i9ymaub,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxllx0/the_work_of_the_russian_kamikaze_uav_cube_on_the/i9yudvn/,1653503526,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653474715.0,[],text,t2_14qromdu,False,False,

We are both actually technically correct, it just comes down to interpretation of what a Sniper is.

The Soviet then often Soviet derived application of Snipers is very different to that of typically found in Western forces. They applied ""snipers"" at a section/platoon level with a focus in intermediate ranges (More a Designated Marksman Role as understood in the West) where as in many Western forces they are considered a separate asset with longer range and greater precision being a focus.

In addition where Snipers were previously considered a long range single shot asset in Western forces they have increasingly become applied to shorter range roles. Chris Kyle a US Sniper covers his changing approach to sniping throughout his combat experiences with his Urban experiences taking him to act in a role that you could say is similar to the platoon level role that Soviet snipers played.

If you understand game theory combined with long term geo-strategic goals; this almost certainly will not happen.  Trust me, there were *many* people saying in 1945 ""I really hope we stop developing atomic/nuclear weapons before we might encounter some real bad shit"".  What ensued was a Cold War arms race that went on for 50 years until one side collapsed economically.  This all happened in spite of numerous attempts to curtail the development and spread of these weapons with non-proliferation treaties.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, there is a 'prisoner's dilemma' at work regarding rival countries.  Each country's 'optimal strategy' is to choose better arms and technology, as whichever choice the enemy has made, they do better by choosing better than remaining stagnant.  This creates a situation where each side is constantly trying to get an edge on the other.  Even if the defense departments of each country decide to reel in their R&amp;D, there will inevitably be developments in the private sector that will have practical application in the military to gain advantages.

We're basically in the infant stages of drone application to warfare.  Well, drone application anywhere to be honest.  It simply won't be possible to have AI programmed drones delivering our Amazon trinkets right to our doorstep **and not** have military AI drones delivering bombs to the enemy, since we can't count on rival countries agreeing to not develop them in that capacity.",43ca85ab8a0507dacaacd8d3212fe7ee908af7fc,True,False,,,,,0,1653500648,,0,{},i9yn2wy,False,t3_uxllx0,False,True,t1_i9ygq9b,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxllx0/the_work_of_the_russian_kamikaze_uav_cube_on_the/i9yn2wy/,1653500665,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653471848.0,[],text,t2_oodma,False,False,

Europe and USA are the biggest trade partners of China: close to three-quarters of their export. Russia is 2+% and shrinking. Why would China- a state or a random Chinese corporation- risk losing 70% of its market to sanctions or boycotts trying to save Russia? The only difference between western corporations and China- is the fact that westerners officially state their intentions to leave the russian market, while China quietly and unofficially cuts supplies.

Thats a region they had to stabilise, they made influx of money and rebuild it so Kadyrov can keep dangerous separatist and terrorist movements controlled, otherwise it would be next afganistan.

Your argument of ukrainians using cities as human shields loses all sense since there are many cases of russian soldiers being marauders (taking property of ukrainians on taken tarritories, even when owners are still there), raping people and executing them. So burn in hell. All this bullshit of ukrainians being nazis, hiding behind civilians are just russian propaganda attempts to dehumanise them, so its ok to kill them.

2728,[],False,,deliosenvy,,,,,,"1. I don't think Ukraine is experience much higher levels of attrition since they are still mounting an extremely stiff defensive position and exerting extreme toll on Russians. Had they been experiencing above the standard ratio we would have seen a complete collapse which are not seeing. Russia has demonstrated what happens when you send untrained conscripts to battlefield its not something Ukraine wants to replicate. And ideally they don't want to do multiple smaller counter offensives. They seem content buying time by fighting on razors edge with defense in depth and this is worked very well. Ukraine has troops for defensive operations they appear to be accumolating around Kherson and Zaproz.
2. Khakriv offensive was neither shortlived nor a fluke as you make it out to be. It was a successful counter attack that pushed Russians out and keeps those troops in check there but same goes in return. Russians cant effectively retake those areas but at the same time those troops cannot move. 
3. Than there is Belarus keeping Ukraine in check in the north and Transistria keeping their forces in check in the west.
4. RF are deffinately not out of fight. And I don't think anybody expected a rollover but its highly likely that taking Sdonets. and Lyman with the rest of fragment of JFO area will break their backs. They do not have the troops to effectively spread out this frontline and retain the territory.
5. Ukraine is planning for mid-late June counter offensive likely across all lines. This coincides with multiple other vectors. They likely want to attack across the frontline from Kherson, Zaproz, Khakriv and Sdonets. Once this happens they will need to maintain momentum for which they severly lack counter-battery and anti-air capabilities.
6. During this time Ukraine is getting multitude of NATO weapons that need careful introduction into the field. They received and are receiving some 7 different mobile artillery systems. They now have much more Tanks than what they had at the start its likely they lack crews to man these and are training people for them.
7. Ukraine is buying time for shipments from lend-lease to come in we are waiting on the word on US MLRS and NASAMS 2 &amp; 3 which will be crucial. Also artillery Ukraine desperately needs more long range artillery its why they cant conduct proper counter offensives currently.
8. Massive supplies are inbound in next two weeks all of these vectors align. Ukraine desperately needs these.
9. Kherson is not an issue for Ukraine this will likely be the easiest fight. If they launch an attack there, Russian troops have two options. Bail or die there is not laying down ponton bridges across that river bed.
10. Ukrainian offensive depends on how US/UK/EU/NATO will move in next 2-3 weeks. Mechanised infantry and heavy armour are not a problem but without heavy anti-air and long range counter battery this will be a walk into a meatgrider for Russian artillery.
11. Ukraine forms their strategy based on US/NATO field and stallite intelligence. They are likely coordinating with US/NATO command on their actions. So while things may appear odd/dire/unresonable to us they might not to them.
12. Same was with Mauripol that was falling each day for 3 months in the most ideal situation for Russia. Yes it was an eventual defeat for Ukraine but it was also a massive success as was pointed out by US and NATO as well since it bought precious time. 
13. Time is what Ukraine needs to get advance weapons flowing in and get their army in the west ready. I mean everyone sees this Russia is extremely worried you can see this in their media/actions/telegram/social media about their chances of taking this land and keeping it. Everyone except the worry trolls and armchair generals on social media.
14. Overall I (without any military experience just going by what people with experience are saying) expect Russians to take this small part of JFO and parade it as a massive victory but at a massive cost. By late June I see a large shift for Ukraine.
15. However without heavy artillery and heavy anti air I don't see Ukraine making a successful counteroffensive to a large degree. All eyes for now are pointed at US to see what will be allowed from lend-lease. If Ukraine gets precision guided MLRS they will wastly outrange Russia in that case I think by September Ukraine could be back to February 24th. Tho I don't see them beyond this point. Likely at that point they dig in and look for diplomatic solution.",9b5832900a026fbc0da1995db452a5e9c372d6cc,True,False,,,,,0,1653498978,,0,{},i9yis3q,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,False,t1_i9y6tv3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9yis3q/,1653498993,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653470178.0,[],text,t2_k2j93,False,False,

&gt;Putin wouldnt ignite war in donbas and lugansk

Emsss... War was supposed to end in 2015 with Minsk 2 agreement, and the republics back to Ukraine but surprise surprise it was Ukraine the one that refused to apply and adhere to them, surprise surprise you don't wanna follow your peace treaty and wow there is war again who Russian dare to trust Ukraine for 8 years how they dare how bad they are.

&gt;Also russia mobilised men age 18-60 in Lnr and Dnr and are actively using them in frontlines.....

Well, for those republics is an existence war, haven't you seen the age of those who surrender fighting for Ukraine? I'm amazed of how much most of them are relatively old.

&gt;Russia literally destroyed THE MOST RUSSIAN AREA IN UKRAINE.

It's what happens when Ukraine entrenched themselves and takes defensive positions in city's and apartment and refuses to surrender or fall back if Russia are atacking them (check severodonesk for example, military logic say you fall back, but Ukraine willing to let their soldiers die will make them stay in place and suffer the same fate of mariupol, city taken by force and Ukraine soldiers either dead or surrendered)

If you wanna conquere a land where the enemy is there you are forced to destroy them or don't make any progress at all, do you know how wars go?

&gt;those are average joes, who they send like a cannon fodder

Same statement Ukraine forces is being telling in quite some videos now, they are taken by the officials to a defensive position, orders to dig a trench and take defensice positions, later officials go and they are forced to stay there unprepared.

There are even trials now in Ukraine against a brigade that refused to be sent to the meat grinder unequiped....

&gt;cant rebuilt they own country

Yeah definitively Chechenia is in ruins still.... You don't seems aware of how much a pain in the ass is to maintain a road in the Russian climate and with the land square of Russia.

&gt;they dont give a fuck.

In addition, if the tank can't handle a hit from an RPG from the side it's probably going to have issues dealing with the air-dropped drone ordinance the Ukrainians are fond of using. Also I feel it's important to point out that the hatch design on the tank is horrific. It's a death trap and hard to escape from. Maybe the anti-mine armor will protect it a bit.

The only purpose of these tanks would be holding them in reserve so they can free up other tanks to assist in offensive operations. They absolutely should not be deployed in frontline combat.",0e6c8a216fa83516c29e5da4e097c4b99164845a,True,False,,,,,0,1653496836,,0,{},i9yd9f8,False,t3_uxbmks,False,True,t1_i9xa4x9,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxbmks/tank_general_post/i9yd9f8/,1653496855,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653468036.0,[],text,t2_67wqo,False,False,

Thats not how it works. You build trenches in anticipation around expected avenues of advancing. Which usually go through towns and roads. Urban areas act as already built fortified areas, so Ukranians use them too. These towns get heavily bombed until defenses are thinned out, then defenders retreat to next defensive position, which is not 100m away, but many km away in the next town or defensible terrain, which is being prepared before bombing of current position starts.   


**""These villages are empty by now, no sane person would stay there while the ruSSians are shelling them. They didn't \*need\* any Ukrainian forces staying there to be shelled to hell by the invading barbarians.""**  


They shell them until defenders retreat or suffer enought cassualties, constantly monitor with small drones to check this, when defenses are thinned out enought assault with tanks and infantry. This is evident from dozens of combat footage and battle reports from both sides.  


Im still a bit surprised at how hostile some react when stating simple and well known facts. Some try to demonize a side so hard that cant even accept reality.  


Also, why would russians want to destroy what they intend to keep, if they can avoid it?

Take as an example Kherson and Mariupol:  


Kherson: Took it without much resistance. Result: city almost intact.  


Mariupol: Defended almost to the last man, took fortified positions in block buildings etc. Result: City bombed and destroyed.  


If your theory was correct, they would have destroyed Kherson ""because the barbarians want to destroy everything and kill everyone"".  


No. The level of destruction is directly related to the effort of defending such place.",9f54a320085b37c28f8bc733657449e456c36b8e,True,False,,,,,0,1653495846,,0,{},i9yapsf,False,t3_ux652c,False,True,t1_i9x0jzu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ux652c/drone_assisting_lpr_tank_advancing_in/i9yapsf/,1653495858,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653467046.0,[],text,t2_787mjxig,False,False,

However it is possible that they are using a Ukrainian made copy the [FORT 301](https://www.skopjesos.com.mk/mk/proizvodi/Fort-301.html) which was allegedly [only issued to the ""OMEGA Group"" of Ukrainian special forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBcVIFLzhU)

This is quite interesting because based on the helmet of the seemingly Russian soldier they are not standard forces and so we have to ask:  


1. Are the Russian forces using the Galatz in some groups over the existing Dragunov rifle [which underwent a upgrade](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/russia-offers-dragunov-sniper-rifle-upgrade-demonstration-to-army-next-month/articleshow/83750360.cms?from=mdr) and which is well suited for the role of an Urban Designated Marksman Rifle and possibly use by Snipers in the anticipated &lt;300m ranges typically found in this environment?
2. Is this a case of a battlefield pick up, with the rifle itself if only used by OMEGA special forces being evidence of their presence in Mariupol?

The Azov forces are most commonly associated with Mariupol. They were of a finite number, the Ukrainian govt is being extremely tight lipped about what is where and losses taken. It may well be possible that Mariupol as a propaganda piece was successful but that many more losses than ever considered by online communities such as Reddit took place. 

It could well have been a military disaster for Ukraine with the loss of large numbers of it's highly trained forces. Alternatively it could be as is perceived by many a costly victory for Russia.

Because this attack did not come as a surprise and it has evolved as predicted based on the local topography, it is a planned action. Maybe it is good plan, maybe it is only the best plan available, maybe it is a bad one. Waging war requires some amount of experiments and dynamic actions or it will not arrive into any conclusions. You have to break some eggs.

What we know is that right now the pincer movement cannot happen, because russians would have to come over the river which is extrelemy dangerous and costly if it fails (as we have seen, you lose 1 BTG per day trying).

They could start to push against Sieverdonetsk but that city could be quite well fortified. This will be shown within a week or so. It is also dual city which has natural obstacle running in the middle, it cannot be easily encircled or reduced to rubble. Also we do not know the troop Russian concentrations which can be too low for city fighting. Otherwise they would've just took the city head on earlier.

What is immidiately true is that the Popasna spearhead will now dilute and its artillery will get weaker as the pinpoint action is gone. Air force will have harder time because it is not dynamical in nature (Friend or foe, probably impossible to distinguish). 

So what we might be observing is local bubble which gets filled by several BTGs who are not able to push much further lacking reinforcements.

I will paraphrase analysis of others here. 
One of the biggest unknowns is the current state of UA army.
They of course are preparing reserve units behind the scenes but they are some time coming.

Kherson/SW  front: UA allows time for RF to prepare  defences there. Hardly any offensive actions. 
Kharkiv, the ""counteroffensive"" was somewhat short lived and hardly achieved anything of meaning apart from pushing RF artillery away from the city, and is over for the time being. And RF had a only token  forces there few weeks ago. 

And now Donbas,  if UA were able to counter RF advances, they clearly wouldn't allow them to create current situation.
UA forces are holding there for dear life, which means they buying time, or they got caught like garrison of Mariupol.

So conclusion is:
1. UA army  suffer from much higher level of attrition that is widely believed and currently are unable to mount any meaningful offensive operations, and not even able to prevent the gains. And needs probably months to get to the level required. 

2.RF forces are not out of the fight, and will not be rolled over anytime soon, if ever. 

3.

3426,[],False,,TheOkayestLawyer,,,,,,"On August 7, 1971, a heavy recon team from Command &amp; Control North, MACV-SOG, comprised of six American Green Berets and eight Montagnards, had been set up on a disused fire support base on a hill near the DMZ between South and North Vietnam. This team, comprised of two separate recon teams and operating this mission as RT Kansas, was led by Lt. Loren “Festus” Hagen. On the hill with Hagen were Bruce Berg, Oran Bingham, Tony Anderson, William Rimondi, and William Queen.

At first light on August 7, and under the cover of fog, the NVA attacked the hill in an attempt to wipe RT Kansas out. The attack was initiated by an RPG which impacted Berg’s bunker directly and collapsing his position. Shortly thereafter, Bingham was mortally wounded while trying to fend off the attack coming at his position. After rallying the remaining members of RT Kansas and shifting the defensive positions, Hagen attempted to run through a curtain of small arms fire to Berg’s position, and was mortally wounded in the process. Three Americans and at least one Montagnard were killed in the first minutes of the engagement. 

Tony Anderson, using RT Kansas’ last surviving URC-10 survival radio and his code name for the mission, “School Hanger,” began communicating with the orbiting Forward Air Controller, callsign “Covey” (and also “Oscar Juliet” depending on who the communications are with). In this clip, you can hear Anderson request fast movers, in this case a flight of two F4 Phantoms callsign “Gunfighter 01” and “Gunfighter 02,” to strike from the west side to the south side of the hill. During his transmission, the pops and crackles in the background aren’t static. It’s the sound of the NVA’s small arms directed at the team, and RT Kansas’ guns furiously fighting back.

Tony Anderson’s direction of air strikes broke the back of the NVA’s attack on several occasions, and resulted in the survival of himself, Rimondi, and Queen, as well as seven Montagnards.

Cossacks don't exist anymore since the Cossack genocide of the Soviet Union and the betrayal of the Cossacks of 1945.  
  
These ""Cossacks"" are Russians who joined a voluntary police force of sorts, and after a couple of years of ""patrolling around"" they get a piece of paper which says they're ""real Cossacks"". They then parade around in uniform and do their pathetic little parades.  
  
Basically they slave away and do dirty work for law enforcement agencies and in return they get a couple of rubles and they can dress up like the bunch of clowns that they are.

Cossacks don't exist anymore since the Cossack genocide of the Soviet Union and the great betrayal of the Cossacks of 1945.

They then parade around in special uniform and do their pathetic little parades. They're clowns, that's what the are.

This team, comprised of two separate recon teams and operating this mission as RT Kansas, was led by Lt. Loren “Festus” Hagen. On the hill with Hagen were Bruce Berg, Oran Bingham, Tony Anderson, William Rimondi, and William Queen.

At first light on August 7, and under the cover of fog, the NVA attacked the hill in an attempt to wipe RT Kansas out. The attack was initiated by an RPG which impacted Berg’s bunker directly and collapsing his position. Shortly thereafter, Bingham was mortally wounded while trying to fend off the attack coming at his position. After rallying the remaining members of RT Kansas and shifting the defensive positions, Hagen attempted to run through a curtain of small arms fire to Berg’s position, and was mortally wounded in the process. Three Americans and at least one Montagnard were killed in the first minutes of the engagement. 

Tony Anderson, using RT Kansas’ last surviving URC-10 survival radio and his code name for the mission, “School Hanger,” began communicating with the orbiting Forward Air Controller, callsign “Covey” (and also “Oscar Juliet” depending on who the communications are with). In this clip, you can hear Anderson request fast movers, in this case a flight of two F4 Phantoms callsign “Gunfighter 01” and “Gunfighter 02,” to strike from the west side to the south side of the hill. During his transmission, the pops and crackles in the background aren’t static. It’s the sound of the NVA’s small arms directed at the team, and RT Kansas’ guns furiously fighting back.

Tony Anderson’s direction of air strikes broke the back of the NVA’s attack on several occasions, and resulted in the survival of himself, Rimondi, and Queen, as well as seven Montagnards. Loren Hagen was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor, and Tony Anderson and William Queen were each awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Their gallantry was partially recorded by a cassette deck linked to the helmet of a Cobra pilot involved in RT Kansas’ extraction.",2f028d63951fbf7eaea4ec29680ed1ce1ec6b1c6,True,False,,,,,0,1653490490,,0,{},i9xx8b9,True,t3_uxj5sb,False,True,t3_uxj5sb,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxj5sb/combat_audio_rt_kansas_august_7_1971/i9xx8b9/,1653490509,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653461690.0,[],text,t2_8httml7j,False,False,

Why do you think they are not conscripting from the major cities? Not only a racist policy but the hicks are clueless with only TV for guidance. NeoNazis everywhere think rinse and repeat WW2 is a good idea. Holy crap?

How many Europeans resisted the Iraq Wars? How many Israelis actively see Palestinians being robbed and resist? How many people anywhere resist their national interests when they only get propaganda for info? In the US we have been doing all kinds of crazy crap the public murmurs about but never does anything. Because of the love of power and money. People are easy to control emotionally. Bush is the head of the CIA when they are involved in drug smuggling and illegal weapons transfers. The head of intelligence claims he knows nothing. THE HEAD of intelligence. Then instead of seeing him as a liar or incompetent, we made him president. People are insane and emotionally driven just as you are in your conviction, as am I. But it doesn't change the fact what they are doing is wrong but for a 20-year-old to figure it out somehow? Good luck with that theory. Your statement tells me you would easily fall under the spell of emotionalized propaganda. So would I if not born under the right circumstances. 

Look at Germany right now dragging its feet insuring that Russia gets appeased and future power to Russia so another war will come. Never again my ass. Culture, propaganda, tribal thinking, religious bigotry, love of money, comfort, power, etc... Most of the ones surrendering en masse are there from the beginning and see they are underequipped and mistreated. They are not surrendering on moral grounds. If they were we would see mass vids of that. They just feel trapped and then confronted they admit it under social duress.

I'd like to think the world was as aware as you want to believe it is but it is not. Johnny Dep and Amber Hurd get as much if not more attention than the war in Ukraine and far more attention than any number of conflicts people don't even realize that those life and death situations even exist.

The Germans have not changed and won't. Appeasement at others' expense is their motto and they see they can send weapons with no fear but deliberately cause Ukraine to suffer so they can make nice with the Evil Empire. We are still in the Dark Ages only we have frappuccinos and cell phones. The age of enlightenment is still 500 years away. Every preceding era in the more sophisticated societies thought they were the enlightened ones. Lol.

The different factions of the Mujahideen split up into groups, Initially the main groups fighting eachother were the Islamic State of Afghanistan, made of mostly of groups that the US had backed, and Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin. In 1994 the Taliban was formed.

In 1996 a new stage of the Civil War began. The Islamic State of Afghanistan, made up largely of the Northern Alliance, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan made up largely of the Taliban (and then groups such as al Qaeda participating as well). The Northern Alliance was comprised of the Mujahideen factions that the US had thrown almost the entirety of its support and weapons behind. The US was relatively selective with its factions during the Soviet conflict, chosing to send a lot of support to Ahmad Shah Massoud who ended up heading the Northern Alliance. 

Do you know what Taliban means? It means Students in Pashto, and that's what it's origins are. In the early to mid 1990s, the movement recruited students from Southern and Eastern Afghanistan who had been evacuated to Pakistan during the Soviet invasion and brought up in fundamentalist religious schools known as madaris. The Taliban was a response to and movement AGAINST the Mujahideen warlords of the 1970s-1990s.

Everything you said in your response is so disgustingly incorrect it borders on maliciously false It distorts actual history into some weird fucking ""All mujahideen look alike"" reality when the history is so so so much more complex.",6ec6b6f1a395c5f9036a3422657474ba2f29a7d8,True,False,,,,,0,1653487422,,0,{},i9xpwvb,False,t3_ux1ze7,False,True,t1_i9wrqql,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ux1ze7/taliban_overrun_by_isisk_nsfw_afghanistan/i9xpwvb/,1653487438,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653458622.0,[],text,t2_eynswxcy,False,False,

Another example, in my city, there are a few buildings that have been started, foundations built, and stopped (no funding). Some have been refurbished and are used for a different purpose than initially planned.

A plan, even if it takes 10 years to develop, design, or whatnot, is a just a plan. Especially if it's a long way from being produced and especially if you have a crisis situation (such as losing a lot of weaponry).

So, yes, the design and plan being done (I'll leave out a question if the details are actually true), is an indication that they have the determination for it to be built. But it's no proof they will build it from this situation.

&gt; Didn't find any more recent information post-war if that plan was impacted.

&gt; They're already working on a new class of nuclear powered missile cruiser, twice the displacement as the moskva, and contruction was supposed to start next year

Same here, construction will start next year - these are simply plans.

Why I quoted the phrases is because these are all plans. Plans that don't include a scenario where you lose a bulk of your peacetime army. Plans that don't include the situation where your economy is hurt because of sanctions. Plans where your economy is hurt because war is expensive as hell and the longer it takes the more resources it drains.

We don't know how long this war will last and what their economy will look like in the end. Yes, there is a possibility the plans they have will be put into action. But considering there's a huge situation evolving that could impact them greatly, we simply don't know.

Having plans doesn't mean they're spending and will build. It means they have plans.

I run a business, at the start of each year, I have a plan for the following year. I build the plan based on the current situation and a forecast of how the year will go. During the year I may make minor changes to the plan depending on how the year is going (including both scenarios: better or worse than expected). If there's a drastic change in the situation, it impacts my plans (take COVID as an example). Plans don't mean it's happening, it means you have a plan you wish to put into action. Whether you do it or not, that is in the future.",372b2d70eb732418e4e9068bf96e270e112d25b2,True,False,,,,,0,1653482134,,0,{},i9xew7m,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t1_i9xdc3u,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9xew7m/,1653482150,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653453334.0,[],text,t2_u3nqf,False,False,

&gt;According to a leaked e-mail from an analyst at the intelligence firm Stratfor, Russia and Israel engaged in a deal in 2008 in which Jerusalem provided the Kremlin with secret codes for Georgian UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in exchange for information on Iranian missile systems.

&gt;he Russians would've been an ideal source of information for Israel, as Yaakov Lappin at The Jerusalem Post reports, because they sold Iran 29 launch vehicles carrying batteries of surface-to-air missiles in 2005, which make up Iran's Tor-M1 defense system.

On the other hand...

https://www.wired.com/2008/08/did-israel-trai/

&gt;The Russian military blasted Israel today for supplying weapons and training to its adversaries in Georgia. ""Israel armed the Georgian army,"" Russian Deputy Chief of General Staff Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn told a Moscow press conference. Jerusalem provided Tblisi with ""eight types of military vehicles, explosives, landmines and special explosives for the clearing minefields [sic]. "" […]

Kind of inline with Israeli foreign policy though. They don't give a fuck what it takes or who gets screwed, they secure their own first, they will give up other countries to get intel on their direct enemies.

russian tanks where built to be straight forward not cheap.

T62 was the first to use smoothbore and APFSDS 

T64 was the first tank with a 125mm gun and composite armor .

T72A incorporated a laser rangfinder and could stop all 105 ammunition at range.

etc etc.
soviet tank where never really cheap after the second world war .

what we see today is the 90s black hole, T72,T90a are good tanks but they are based on autdated princioples.

the soviets wanted ti make the switch ti t14 armata like platforms(obj195) with 152mm gun,APS and unmanneed turrets once again betaing nato tanks in technolohy and firepower , too bad they where collapsing and did not have so much money , even after as Russian federation they never quite got back theyr true power and relied on modernization.


T72/T64/T80 chassis are still conoetitive but have some flaws Western and newer tanks lacks.

All the russian tanks are based on the T64 layout wifh where meant to go after M48 and leopard1s with primitive fire control groups, so being small was actually a plus , and to this principle they used a smaller transmission(sacrificing reverse speed) they used an autoloder ( sacrificio a future protected ammo compartment) theyr guns where already using apfsds much better than NATO and the soviets wanted to always be on the offensive so hunter killer capabilites where never taken in consideration.


NATO tanks where developed after decades and tailored to modern fighting doctrine, there is a reson why T14 and obj195 don't look like russian tanks, that layout is not optimal any ore for modern combat .

T90M would be very close to a Western nato tank, with a protected autoloader, externat spare ammo containers, hunter killer capabilities , ome of the most protected frontal arch in existance , thermal sights and rcws for the commander and even a programmable HE shell ,

but still has to sacrifice reverse speed and gun depression for the legacy T64 layout .

as we are here , the T90M in kharkiv was destroyed by friendly fire probably after being lightly damaged by enemy fire, in the famous video there are a lot of clues that the shot isn't from a ukranian system but from a russian tank before retreating , to not let the ukranians take a T90M as a trophy.

so no t90m aren't pointless , they are very capable tanks , but they have the same side protection as a T72B3M(aka m7ch more than a standard nato tank but not enough to stop modern tandem warhead missles reliably) so don't expect this tanks to be invincible, m1a2 got buttfucked , T90A got buttfucked , chally2 got buttfucked any tank can be destroyed and will be.",fe011283757d3d3dd859f4200759908ca16fb91f,True,False,,,,,0,1653473055,,0,{},i9x16u5,False,t3_uxbmks,False,False,t1_i9wxzil,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uxbmks/tank_general_post/i9x16u5/,1653473067,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653444255.0,[],text,t2_1lz1f0n9,False,False,

I've been to Crimea twice since annexation in 2014 and personally I feel that Crimea is a bit of an incorporated territory, and certainly not everyone is happy with the outcome, but the majority certainly is. This is reflected in the polling.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From March 12 – 14, 2014, Germany's largest pollster, the GfK Group, conducted a survey with 600 respondents and found that 70.6% of Crimeans intended to vote for joining Russia, 10.8% for restoring the 1992 constitution, and 5.6% did not intend to take part in the referendum.\[34\]\[35\] The poll also showed that if Crimeans had more choices, 53.8% of them would choose joining Russia, 5.2% restoration of 1992 constitution, 18.6% a fully independent Crimean state and 12.6% would choose to keep the previous status of Crimea.\[34\]  
Gallup conducted an immediate post-referendum survey of Ukraine and Crimea and published their results in April 2014. Gallup reported that, among the population of Crimea, 93.6% of ethnic Russians and 68.4% of ethnic Ukrainians believed the referendum result accurately represents the will of the Crimean people. Only 1.7% of ethnic Russians and 14.5% of ethnic Ukrainians living in Crimea thought that the referendum results didn't accurately reflect the views of the Crimean people.\[36\]  
In May 2014, Washington, D.C., pollster Pew Research published results of a survey that encompassed Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia, in which it was reported that 88% of Crimeans believed the government of Kyiv should officially recognize the result of Crimea's referendum.\[37\]

Generals going to the front is a uniquely Russian cultural aspect. It's strange to us, but that's how they do it. They're expected to be on the battlefield giving direction personally. The reports of the theatre commander being killed/wounded are probably untrue.

The Moskva although a major propaganda victory is pretty irrelevant to the war. It's a 70s ship that has been on the edge of being scrapped for 20 years. Didn't even have the capability to attack land targets.

Then the same western powers are shocked when they ask these people to stand on their own feet, but there are no deep rooted institutions in place that provide a sense of national belonging or pride. Where they are willing to give more than half a fuck about fighting effectively against the next foreign occupying power, or the next dictator the steals their money for a generation or two.

The Vietnamese had a strong national identity, and had been fighting foreign occupation, or the risk of foreign occupation for TWO THOUSAND YEARS.

The Japanese had been heavily indoctrinated into an incredibly nationalistic cult that worshipped their Emperor as a living God. 

The Taliban(and by expansion much of Afghanistan at a certain point) had been doing much like the Vietnamese. The difference here was, the Taliban fought for religious zeal, not a nationalistic one. The Afghan people as a whole, don't really view themselves as a national body. They view themselves tribally. 

Afghanistan is a perfect example of this. These are not Arab people. The ANA was an incredibly corrupt force. The men were apathetic and only there for a government handout (a US handout if we're being honest). They didn't give a fuck about the idea of nation building. They didn't give a fuck about the idea of democracy. They had little to believe in, little to live for, and less to care about. Drug addiction was rampant. On the flip side, the Taliban was motived by the idea of religious unity. They were motivated. 

How can two different people from the same what are essentially the same region, with close cultural ties (even though there is rampant tribalism) behave so differently? One side was brainwashed into having motivation. The other side was depressed into apathy. Guess which side won.

The Israeli tank column was rendered immobile, because so many of their tanks were mobility killed. They were then forced into what was essentially an alamo situation, where the column was strung out, stuck and surrounded by Hezbollah. This was a primary reason Israel noped out of the war via a peace deal as quickly as they did.

The armored push had around 300 tanks. Over 50 were hit and damaged. 5 were destroyed, and over 20 were mobility kills. They basically got bogged down, had too many tanks disabled that they couldn't leave behind, so they had to hunker down.

I'd call that a massive success for Hezbollah, considering they are an irregular militia, facing one of the worlds most potent military forces at that scale of fighting. It is certainly a far worse performance than Russia has had in Ukraine thus far. 

In fact, it was the Lebanon war in 2006 that is what informed my opinion of what would happen in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. On day 1 or 2 on reddit I said this wasn't going to go well for Russia, and that it would take months to resolve at the minimum. The picture wasn't as clear then about what level of commitment Russia was making to this invasion, so I believe my assumption was that Russia would eventually, temporarily occupy most of the East and probably Kyiv, before pulling out. Either way. The Lebanon war in 2006 was the closest anyone has really seen to modern peer on peer warfare.

Limited in range, but cheap enough. 88-90mm WW2 guns with sensitive proximity fuses (even birds can trigger them) would be probably the best, but no one operates these anymore and only if the war would go on another two years you might see these again.

90mm vs 40mm covers basically twice the area and altitude, so you would need less. They can also be used as light artillery, so they are never completely useless.

In WW2, the US Bomber command in Europe decided in around 1942 that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany was hopelessly ineffective. The purpose from then on shifted to luring German pilots into the air to shoot them down. That became the primary purpose of the strategic bombing campaign, inflicting any industrial or infrastructure damage was an ancilliary goal.

Allied bombers continued to be absolutely butchered in the air, but you know who else was butchered? The Germans. By the time D-Day rolled around, Germany had hundreds of ME-109s and FW-190s sitting around waiting to be used. They didn't have any pilots though. 

You've basically just described why assymetric warfare, and even assymetry between opposing sides in a conventional conflict makes it very difficult to discern what is happening or how effective anyone is. 

That said, I would guess that if the NATO/US estimate of Ukrainian KIA on/around March 6th is accurate (2-4k) and their estimate of Russian KIA from the same time period (3-6k) is also accurate. Ukraine has probably lose at a bare minimum 15k KIA, and Russia bare minimum 20k KIA. If we just extrapolate those numbers out based on their average. Ukraine may have lost as many as ~26-27k already, and Russia 39-40k. Now, we need to also consider the source of these figures. They are pro-Ukrainian. I think it is safe to assume there is probably a little bias cooked into these two estimates. Ukraine probably lost a little bit more by March 6, and Russia a little bit less than was estimated. Either way.

27k killed, vs 40k losses, while attacking, against a significantly numerically superior enemy in theater.

5886,[],False,,ArrowheadDZ,,,,,,"Well, more few thoughts about MLRS…  Remember what it’s original design objective was:  To be purpose-built for counter-battery fire.  That means a few things:

1.  It’s OK if the reload and refire rate is slower than tube artillery.  The design goal is to “let ‘er rip” and deliver a lot more payload a lot faster that tube artillery.

2. I need to spray an area.  My counter-battery radar is (a) only so precise) and (b) gives my little information about how the guns are dispersed on the ground, and in what relation to the FDC.  So I want to put a very large number of cluster munitions into a box that is fairly big.  I want to hit a lot of stuff that may be spread out, and I want to hit all of it at once.  This is an important psychological deterrent message to send your enemy:  “If you pull that lanyard ONE time, I am going to kill ALL of you.  Everybody.  All at once.”  Psychology is an important aspect of counter-battery fire.  The original 9-launcher battery configuration could shoot 3 missions of about 23,000 bomblets, or a single concentrated can of whoop-ass of almost 70,000 grenade-sized bomblets. 

3.  The radar won’t tell me if it’s towed or SP, so I need to use a multi-purpose submunition.  Hence, for a long time, MLRS was all DPICM, not HE/VT.

4.  I need standoff range.  I want to place my counter-battery weapons in a location where they have a range advantage over the batteries they are firing against.

And that’s what we got with MLRS.  Whereas Soviet tactics called for large volleys of smaller inertial rockets in a “calliope” kind of attack, the US largely moved away from this after WWII and Korea.  We weren’t designing MLRS for troop concentrations, buildings, anti-armor.  It wasn’t intended to simply augment tube artillery.

Back to the original comment, we just haven’t had the use cases that have lended themselves well for the MLRS design objective, whereas the Russians and Ukrainians ARE in the midst of a conflict that meets some of the design objectives of the Grad and Smerch...  The ability to put a lot more projectiles in flight at one time and then scoot, whereas tube batteries would have to be stationary too long to fire the same kind of densities.",a5f4b1e85605c8df3e6665bea43b68353b7b1c3d,True,False,,,,,0,1653454824,,0,{},i9weri4,False,t3_uwqg4g,False,True,t1_i9w177g,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uwqg4g/24th_afu_brigade_fires_mrls_towards_luhasnk/i9weri4/,1653454837,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653426024.0,[],text,t2_61vhb3q9,False,True,

Grenade shrapnel for modern grenades using Pre Formed Fragmentation (PFF) is indeed quite small, about 2-3gr in weight. A .177 steel BB from a bb gun is 4.5gr, for reference.

However the grenade propels these tiny fragments to an initial velocity of nearly 5,000fps (a rifle bullet is 3,000fps) making steel as small as a grain of sand pretty nasty.

This is also why all of these various small munitions have a '5m lethal radius' - the tiny fragments rapidly lose velocity, and beyond 5m they cease to reliably be able to penetrate a 2mm thick aluminum sheet, which is how they test for lethal radius.

The name operation abu fadel tomer, comes from the name of a fallen houthi soldier called abu fadel tomer. The operation is launched to recover his body after he fell half way in the desert trying to rescue other soldiers stuck on the other of mountains in maarib. Abu fadel was a teenager as well. I will link a video below for him. In this video, abu fadel successfully goes back and forth twice rescuing wounded and fellow soldiers stuck on the other side of the mountain. However, the third time they strike his technical flatten the wheels, leaving him in the open. Wounded, as he is walking toward the camera and walking back for cover, he is shot and killed. This is him in the whole video.

As to your question, yes it is not about killing people nesecerally. But if you want to make it really uncomfortable for the enemy in defensive positions it really does the trick.

There is a radar system that detects shells in flight and calculates the location they were fired from, you can use that to fire at the enemy artillery with your artillery. 

It looks online that the CEASAR system can start to move approximately 30 seconds after the last shell is fired. The setup time is  1 minute.  Compare that th the M777 where I found numbers like 3 minutes to set it up and 3 minutes to start to move.

The tactic of fire and then quickly move away is called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-and-scoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot-and-scoot) 

You can see a demonstration of that idea with a [Swedish ARCHER in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8x8ITwd4Vg) that manage to shoot 23 seconds after it stops, the third round is fired 30 seconds after it stops and it can start moving 74 seconds after it stopped. It starts moving away before the first shell land on the target. The flight time of the shell in the demonstration was 54 seconds.

So even if the enemy picked up the first shell when fired, that counter-battery fire occur with 0s delay and the artillery was the same distance away as the target the vehicle is moving when the first shell land. In reality, there are time delays, and even if it is just a few seconds you can get away from the location you fired the gun


So the ability to quickly move away after you fire improves survivability.",76dba51b8468bb46c8c0d2c3459ee3a7fc9bf745,True,False,,,,,0,1653437681,,0,{},i9vgx1a,False,t3_ux0qlz,False,True,t1_i9vd78e,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ux0qlz/french_caesar_155mm_artillery_in_ukrainian/i9vgx1a/,1653437695,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653408881.0,[],text,t2_aopez,False,False,
