You're ignorant of intelligence. Not because you don't buy into soothsaying, but because you're wrong about everything you're saying. The other guy is right, read your own words: 

&gt;Which is why I wont read further about statisticians further exploring the means of using math for soothsaying in warfare.

This is an extremely strange take and reflects an extremely tactical understanding of the battlefield. I'm assuming you were a junior NCO? 

You can make accurate, probabilistic assessments about enemy troops and their intentions. If you're just going to focus in on all the times those assessments went wrong, of course you're going to be zeroed in on it all being bullshit. 

The intelligence assessments prior to D-Day showed exactly how much the imbalance of airpower or armour was going to influence the operations. The intelligence estimates at the outset of Yom Kippur correctly assessed that the Egyptians could not succeed without an airforce. The intelligence at the outset of Desert Storm correctly prepared the battlespace for a relatively easy victory over a massive enemy force. As it did for Iraq 2003. 

Do you think that commanders just get all their guys and ride into battle, hoping that they'll win? Or are they always performing the kind of basic intelligence analysis that we're talking about?

And whether it fits with your preconceptions of intelligence analysis or not, predicting everything from the behaviour of individual leaders or large international events (like war and outcomes of war) is [entirely possible](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779404) and has been [studied extensively](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-00693-001). 

&gt;The human element is just one tiny sliver of one piece many analysts fail to consider

Incorrect.

It goes without saying that analysts do study the ""human element"", but in case you need a military example, here's a [short description](https://home.army.mil/wood/application/files/8915/5751/8365/ATP_2-01.3_Intelligence_Preparation_of_the_Battlefield.pdf) from the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace. For those that don't know, the IPB is a military analyst's *main* analytical tool. It has four steps, one of which is solely oriented at evaluating the fighting style, morale and intent of the enemy formation: 

&gt;STEP 3—EVALUATE THE THREAT

&gt;The intelligence staff considers broad characteristics when analyzing the threat, such as composition, disposition, strength, combat effectiveness (*operational experience and morale*), doctrine and tactics, support and relationships, electronic technical data, capabilities and limitations, current operations, historical data, and miscellaneous data. 

Feel free to read the entire IPB field manual if you have other questions about what analysts look into when assessing an enemy. 

&gt;Whether you use a calculator or try to take omens from the pattern of bird sign or take omens from the entrails of a goat, you can't know what you can't know and you can only guess. 

This is not true.

Essentially, there are [better techniques](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/16/16511/jdm16511.pdf) to conduct intelligence assessments with.

And there are ways of [training people](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2017.1400230) to get better at conducting intelligence analysis too. 

&gt;And when people guess they're often wrong.

Your options aren't either ""You know what will happen"" or ""You're guessing."" You can make informed decisions about the actions that are about to unfold. 

For example, I know my girlfriend takes the exact same route to the shop every day. If I were to assess that she were going to take that same route today, this wouldn't mean I ""know"" she's going to go that way. It wouldn't mean I'm ""guessing"" in the pejorative sense that you're using the word. It means I'm making an informed assessment based on a large database of data I've accumulated over many years. If she suddenly went a different route because of construction work or because there's a large build up of traffic, my assessment still stood as a very likely outcome. 

I was ""wrong"", factually, but when you give these kinds of assessments to military commanders, they have the ability to make plans and preparations based on that intelligence and be positioned to succeed. If you've been posted to a brigade or division HQ you'll know that there's rarely more important people to the commander than the intelligence cell, for this reason. At a national security level, even more so.",f7b871ef5b900016005713fd3e05e1ab79d81d65,True,False,,,,,0,1653520456,,0,{},i9zykw1,False,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9yckax,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9zykw1/,1653520475,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653491656.0

The goal isn't really taking back all territory. The goal is to make Russia suffer until the dominant consensus in Russian society is that attacking Ukraine leads to suffering. In that sense, a years long grinding conflict that consumes a whole generation without liberating the Donbas may be more effective than a quick victory that liberates everything, involving Crimea. You need large losses to make the costs of war felt by society.

But if Russia ends the war with less territory than it started with because it loses some of the Donbas, then that helps the Russian public conclude the war was a mistake too.

Then, because Russia isn't a democracy, there's the people who actually hold power. Making them feel pain basically means sanctions, enough to harm their lifestyles or bank accounts. There's a reason Ukraine spends roughly equal amounts of time asking for artillery and sanctions.

Why countries fight is a complicated subject. But I think you're making a really bad bet if you think that high casualties will reduce the Ukrainian people will to fight.

First, they're fighting a defensive war. The alternative to war is a ceasefire or surrender.

If they surrender, their expectation of what they will look like is informed by Bucha and their previous experiences with Russia. So the calculation that surrender reduces deaths is not necessarily obvious.

If they get a ceasefire, Russia will rearm, resupply, and attack again when they calculate Ukraine is vulnerable. Essentially they're passing the war down to their children, or more likely to themselves six months from now. Again the calculation that a ceasefire reduces deaths is not intuitive.

Even though Zelensky said ""in certain areas,"" he really meant certain *units* are facing certain force ratios within their areas of operations. It's just faster/easier/simpler to say ""areas."" Meaning, it's not that they are facing a particular force ratio in a particular area per se, but rather a specific unit is defending a specific area against a certain number of Russian troops. 

And that's an artifact of how the intel is reported up the chain from front line units. It's most likely ratios are being reported from the brigade level to the Ukrainian general command, and some brigades are facing 7:1 force ratios in their areas of operations. But it could be at a different granularity unit if that's how their intel analysts collect and report on the data. So if the Ukrainians are reporting at the company level or below, it might literally mean they are facing 7:1 odds on a single, specific street. It is unlikely they are doing so because force ratios would be very noisy at that fine-grained level as Russian attacks shift along different points in the line. You would literally see force ratios changing minute to minute, which really undermines its utility as a metric when reporting to a national political leader. So it is much more likely that we are hearing about operational echelon (ie brigade level) stats. 

Ultimately meaning that there is probably at least one brigade holding a part of the line against seven times their number in Russians. But even that doesn't tell us much about the tactical reality.

Yeah, victorian epithets are however.  ""the bodies of the children start arriving back in closed caskets"", man if only Neville Chamberlain had thought of that, there wouldn't have been a world war 2.

A lot of post-industrial wars in history were prosecuted by people who were aware their people would/were dying, even in large quantities.

The Germans bore a horrible brunt in ww1, they came back home and less than a generation later said ""nah let's go for round 2"".  And that's the Germans who were literally at the front lines, being delivered into your closed caskets, being like ""yeah we'll be down to do this again to achieve political goals"".

You know how many of their children the Houthis have buried?  Most of their children didn't even get caskets, they're just all over the pavement.  And they're only getting more resolute the more it happens, funny that.  Well it's good the Russians didn't bomb or shell any Ukrainian cities, otherwise they'd be pretty angry-oh.

The French Air Force doesn't just get more training hours, they're also way more experienced, because they've been flying sorties as part of all kinds of NATO missions for years. It's quite possible the air war over Ukraine would be drastically different with fully competent pilots on the opposing side.

They've got an airborne force, but you don't want to be flying those transports outside your air defenses, because France would just shoot them down.

The daily Ukraine war megathread is by its nature a discussion of recent events in the war. With the difficulty in getting high quality analysis of up to the minute recent events, there are very few credible sources able to post fast enough. 

This has lead many people here to dive into the world of open source intelligence (or OSINT), which is often just posting what they have found by direct actors in the war. And some of the most popular places for Russian and Ukrainian sources to post new content is places like Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, VK etc.

Posting information from these sources is attractive as it has the potential to uncover new developments of the war. However these sources are also the most common sources of intentional and unintentional disinformation. Information from these sources should be viewed with the utmost skepticism. By the way reddit comments should be viewed with the same extreme skepticism. 

There are communities that have for many years focused intently on OSINT and know what they are doing. Bellingcat is a good example of this. Some of these (like Bellingcat) are worth paying attention to, but even then they are by definition unaccountable for their quality or reliability. 

So if you are new and are not a long time practitioner of geolocation, I would try to stick to credible sources like analysis of RUSI, Michael Kofman, Institute for the Study of War, Rand Corp, the Army and Navy war colleges, Modern War Institute at West Point, CSIS, and articles from established outlets that cite credible experts. You can tell who is legit as they will always use their real name and post their credentials. There is new content being put out everyday and the people who contribute to the forum cannot always get there first, so check up on the websites and post their latest with a submission statement.

What I'm saying is that polling when you have heavy variance in respondent distribution heavily increases the volatility in your results - hence why polls will weigh answers based on demographic factors to produce a more reliable prediction (see: 2016 election polling on how this can fail / succeed). The issue with polling during an active conflict is unique in the sense that conflict heavily distorts and displaces populations at an alarming speed (this should be obvious). 

You also have numerous compounding issues such as social pressures, contested information environments, and poor framing of outcomes based on war's highly contingent nature (e.g., ""do you agree that Ukraine shouldn't cede territory to Russia?"" vs ""should Ukraine take 300,000 casualties to liberate Crimea""). Note that all these problems exist when conducting polling regularly of course, but conflict heightens and distorts to an extreme degree.

A good researcher will attempt, as much as possible, to control for these variables when conducting public polling. But anecdotal (or rather, qualitative) evidence should not be viewed as the opposite to ""hard"" polling data (and I would argue most polling data is *softer* than it appears); rather, a good researcher will attempt to combine the two to determine the degree to which your data captures reality or does not.",6a7cef6011eaa4b55b1ee682076cc4a457c2177a,True,False,,,,,0,1653514457,,0,{},i9zl8iu,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_i9zjz0l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/i9zl8iu/,1653514469,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653485657.0

From what I'm hearing and seeing, we aren't there, or particularly close to there, in the Donbas. Every plane I see is about 50 feet off the ground and dumping flares, so they're operating, but in an environment where their actions are determined as much or more by avoiding AA as by supporting their ground forces. Russia has more control over the air, but nobody is feeling safe when they fly. Every expert I've seen discuss this has referred to this sort of situation as contested.

As far as getting by, I think the Russian air force is much less effective than they would be if it wasn't contested. It's not a good situation, but it seems like one to Ukrainians are able to work with, which matches what I'd call getting by.

&gt; Stephen Mark Kotkin (born February 17, 1959)[1] is an American historian, academic, and author. He is currently the John P. Birkelund '52 Professor in History and International Affairs at Princeton University, where he is also co-director of the program in history and the practice of diplomacy and the director of the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies.[2] He is also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[3] He has won a number of awards and fellowships, including the Guggenheim Fellowship, the American Council of Learned Societies and the National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship.

&gt; Kotkin is a frequent contributor on Russian and Eurasian affairs and writes book and film reviews for various publications, including The New Republic, The New Yorker, the Financial Times, The New York Times and The Washington Post. He also contributed as a commentator for NPR and the BBC.[5] In 2017, Kotkin wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Communist democide resulted in the deaths of at least 65 million people between 1917 and 2017, stating: ""Though communism has killed huge numbers of people intentionally, even more of its victims have died from starvation as a result of its cruel projects of social engineering.""[7]",3a886544e04c07b7ed5e1fec2f67b85bf1d044e6,True,False,,,,,0,1653511100,,0,{},i9zdabd,False,t3_uxocsy,False,True,t1_i9yzrry,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxocsy/stephen_kotkin_russian_historian_on_the_ukraine/i9zdabd/,1653511115,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653482300.0
[],False,,ginger_guy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6o9cu,False,False,"I used to be interested in the concept of soothsaying politics. Tetlock's work was of a particular fascination as he held competitions around super-predicting to see if he could make something of a science out of it. At its height, US intelligence considered adopting Tetlock's methods but eventually turned it down. [Competitions are still done in Europe and some intelligence agencies have taken up the practice](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/15/how-spooks-are-turning-to-superforecasting-in-the-cosmic-bazaar) and, for a while, many corporations wanted their own 'super-predictors'.

Though so called super predictors were more accurate than expert non-super predictors, the answers they would come to were attached with so many asterisks that the information gained was virtually useless. What makes a person more accurate than the experts? Usually it's not base knowledge on a subject, but a set of skills that can be learned to bring out a more thorough answer. Super-predictors ask many qualifying questions, are willing to second guess their assumed knowledge, do post-postmortems after every question is resolved to see what they got right/wrong and why. This allows a super-predictor to narrow down the question into something more digestible, and thus answerable. By this point the answer has become so narrow the insight gleaned may not be particularly helpful.

For example, If I asked: ""will we have self-driving cars by 2025?"" A super-predictor will break down the question into smaller, more answerable questions. ""Will we have self driving cars by 2025"" becomes Once the question is narrowed down to, lets say: ""will any country reach 50%+ adoption of self-driving cars by 2025"", we can begin to actually answer the question. So ""what countries are wealthy enough to make that switch?"" ""Which countries are on-track for a full 5G roll out in that time frame?"" That alone narrows down the field tremendously. That leaves us with Singapore maybe.

I'm wondering if the US will try to put together an international coalition/flotilla to escort cargo ships meant to pick up and distribute Ukraine's grain. IMO Russia is unlikely to directly fire upon the ships of several countries, including NATO allies, on a humanitarian mission to prevent widescale starvation.

West of the Dnipro the Russians aren't flying planes, only thing that flies there are rockets (which admittedly are plentiful and don't always get shot down).  The Ukrainian air defense network is strong.

Any air defense Ukraine does have that can reach the Donbas is insufficient to seriously punish or discourage low-altitude CAS by Russian fighters.  On occasion they get shot down, but intensity of bombardment is going up, not down.

Threat of fires could be so intense they might not even be able to move up, if drones can spot them while road marching forward they could be interdicted along the way and as they are trying to conduct a relief in place, which was always challenging when done in contact. We have no clue what the conditions in this battle are, but since its being constantly reported that the Russians have local air superiority that probably much in the salient is under drone surveillance, possibly even 24/7, especially in the zones where the decisive actions are occurring. If the drones can see it, not only do they know what's happening but they can immediately call artillery on it. 

Plus, much of the UA defenses are situated inside villages, towns, and cities, and the Russians are basically leveling them with fires. Without the standing buildings they are not only suffering heavy losses but the cover itself is disappearing. Primary positions get destroyed, so they move to alternate, which get destroyed, triggering a move to supplemental, which are destroyed, and then its just hasty position wherever they can find them. Its at that point that the towns are usually being taken by the Russians, as they're very vulnerable. The UA reinforcing them might not do much, especially mech units, with IFV and tanks, who are better suited for mobility focused ops (counterattacking) and not urban defenses when the enemy has aerial ISR capabilities. 

That said, the same issues that made those blown-to-shit locations hard for the UA to defend make them that much harder for the Russians to defend too against a counterattack. Especially since the UA defenders who escape know that ground, know where weakpoints exist and their exact locations, know every little fold of the ground already, all the secret avenues of advance that they were probably already using for resupply that they could use as an axis for conducting an attack. 

And moving the reinforcements as far forward as possible doesn't just gain the maneuver elements like infantry or tanks, it means more UA artillery battalions to do counterbattery, more counterbattery radars, more engineers to lay mines or build new defenses behind the front lines, more brigade and battalion staffs to help plan, more snipers, more UAVs, more logistical units, etc.",299422da814e6ce0552146db594955e02051ddd7,True,False,,,,,0,1653509819,,0,{},i9za4f8,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_i9z7ixw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/i9za4f8/,1653509837,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653481019.0

&gt; * These developments reveal that prewar analysis focused too narrowly on the Russian military’s new and modernized equipment, which was hiding ugly facts and conditions. An analysis of those realities, now on full display on Ukraine’s battlefields, provides a far better understanding of what analysts missed in their evaluation of the Russian army that invaded Ukraine. In effect, those gleaming new tanks and planes constitute a Potemkin army, an impressive facade designed to hide from Vladimir Putin the ugly truth that it was not ready for war.

&gt; * Satellite images revealed a major problem Russia has faced since launching the invasion is a breakdown of its logistical supply system. 

&gt; * What accounts for these maintenance and spare parts deficits? Poor planning? Yes. The tyranny of distance? Yes. And then there is the corruption of the Russian military and defense sector.  

&gt; * In 2020, Transparency International’s Government Defence Integrity Index designated Russia’s defense sector as “at high risk of corruption, owing to extremely limited external oversight of the policies, budgets, activities and acquisitions of defence institutions.”

&gt; * Another indicator that helps explain the Russian military’s poor performance so far in Ukraine is its training practices.

&gt; * A lack of rigorous training and relevant experience may explain the limited operations by the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS), one of the war’s ongoing mysteries. 

&gt; * The shift to a narrower front has brought about a regrouping and reorganizing of the Russian military’s capabilities, as well as lessening the strain on its logistics networks, to enable better performance. In addition, the VKS has shown signs of increased activity, and the state of Ukraine’s air defenses may be weaker as almost three months of action and attrition may have reduced the stockpile of surface-to-air munitions.

&gt; * It has proven to be a facade of gleaming new tanks and planes concealing all of the performance and command problems noted above, until they had to fight.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/politics/china-taiwan-military.html

The Biden administration has accelerated its efforts to reshape Taiwan’s defense systems as it projects a more robust American military presence in the region to try to deter a potential attack by the Chinese military, current and former U.S. officials say.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has made American and Taiwanese officials acutely aware that an autocrat can order an invasion of a neighboring territory at any moment. But it has also shown how a small military can hold out against a seemingly powerful foe.

U.S. officials are taking lessons learned from arming Ukraine to work with Taiwan in molding a stronger force that could repel a seaborne invasion by China, which has one of the world’s largest militaries.

The aim is to turn Taiwan into what some officials call a “porcupine”— a territory bristling with armaments and other forms of U.S.-led support that appears too painful to attack.

Taiwan has long had missiles that can hit China. But the American-made weapons that it has recently bought — mobile rocket platforms, F-16 fighter jets and anti-ship projectiles — are better suited for repelling an invading force. Some military analysts say Taiwan might buy sea mines and armed drones later. And as it has in Ukraine, the U.S. government could also supply intelligence to enhance the lethality of the weapons, even if it refrains from sending troops.

American officials have been quietly pressing their Taiwanese counterparts to buy weapons suitable for asymmetric warfare, a conflict in which a smaller military uses mobile systems to conduct lethal strikes on a much bigger force, U.S. and Taiwanese officials say.

Washington increasingly uses the presence of its military and those of allies as deterrence. The Pentagon has begun divulging more details about the sailings of American warships through the Taiwan Strait — 30 since the start of 2020. And U.S. officials praise partner nations like Australia, Britain, Canada and France when their warships transit through the strait.

In ramping up its posture and language, the United States is trying to walk a fine line between deterrence and provocation. The actions risk pushing President Xi Jinping of China to order an attack on Taiwan, some analysts say. A Chinese offensive against Taiwan could take many forms, such as a full-scale sea and air assault on the main island with missile barrages, an invasion of small islands closest to China’s southeast coast, a naval blockade or a cyberattack.

“Are we clear about what deters China and what provokes China?” said Bonnie S. Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “The answer to that is ‘no,’ and that’s dangerous territory.”

“We need to think long and hard on how to strengthen deterrence,” she said.

U.S. officials often discuss potential deterrent actions that end up being dropped because they are deemed too provocative. In the Trump administration, National Security Council officials discussed putting U.S. troops in Taiwan, one former official said. White House and Pentagon officials also proposed sending a high-level U.S. military delegation to Taiwan, but that idea was killed after senior officials at the State Department objected, another former official said.

The president asserted on Monday that the United States had a “commitment” to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan — the third time he has made such remarks during his presidency. And he explicitly said he would take measures that go beyond what the United States has done in Ukraine. While Beijing could see the words as belligerent, they are consistent with the new emphasis in Washington on forceful deterrence.

On Tuesday, Mr. Biden said in Tokyo that the decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” — leaving open whether the U.S. military would fight for Taiwan — still stands. “The policy has not changed at all,” he said.

Harry B. Harris Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and a retired admiral who led the U.S. Pacific Command, said the United States now needed to adopt “strategic clarity” rather than “strategic ambiguity” to serve as a deterrent. China, he said, “isn’t holding back its preparations for whatever it decides it wants to do simply because we’re ambiguous about our position.”

The United States has been urging allies to speak up on Taiwan in an effort to show Beijing that Washington can rally other nations against China if it attacks the self-governing democratic island. On Monday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan said at a news conference with Mr. Biden that the two leaders had affirmed “the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.”

In the three months of war in Ukraine, Washington has held together a coalition of European and Asian partners to impose sanctions against Russia. U.S. officials say they hope the measures send a message to China and other nations about the costs of carrying out the type of invasion overseen by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. U.S. officials are already discussing to what extent they could replicate the economic penalties and the military aid deployed in defense of Ukraine in the event of a conflict over Taiwan.

“I want P.L.A. officers to wake up each day and believe they cannot isolate Taiwan in a conflict and must instead face the decision of initiating a costly, wider conflict where their objectives are beyond their reach,” said Eric Sayers, a former senior adviser to the U.S. Pacific Command who is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, referring to China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, by its initials.

U.S. intelligence analysts have been studying the evolving relationship between China and Russia and the lessons Beijing might be drawing from Ukraine.

Chinese leaders face a complicated calculus in weighing whether their military can seize Taiwan without incurring an overwhelming cost.

A Pentagon report released last year said China’s military modernization effort continued to widen the capability gap between the country’s forces and those of Taiwan. But the Chinese military has not fought a war since 1979, when it attacked Vietnam in an offensive that ended in a strategic loss for China.

To take Taiwan, the Chinese Navy would need to cross more than 100 miles of water and make an amphibious assault, an operation that is much more complex than anything Mr. Putin has tried in Ukraine.

And in any case, perceived capabilities on paper might not translate to performance in the field.

“As we have learned in Ukraine, no one really knows how hard a military will fight until a war actually starts,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral and former dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “China is probably not ready to take a risk of an invasion with current force levels and capabilities in terms of attacking Taiwan.”

American officials are not making that assumption. They have pressed Taiwan to buy weapons systems that they deem suitable for asymmetric warfare against China. The Biden administration recently told the Taiwanese Defense Ministry not to order MH-60R Seahawk helicopters made by Lockheed Martin, and it has also discouraged orders for more M1A2 Abrams tanks.

Admiral Stavridis said the United States needed to get weapons into the hands of the Taiwanese quickly if an invasion looked imminent, with a focus on systems that would wear down Chinese offensive capabilities.

“That would include smart mines, anti-ship cruise missiles, cybersecurity capability and special forces who can neutralize Chinese advance teams, and air defense systems,” he said.

U.S. officials consider mobility to be critical and are encouraging Taiwan to buy mobile land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Stinger antiaircraft missiles could also be valuable for staving off the Chinese air force.

The pace of Taiwan’s weapons purchases has increased. Since 2010, the United States has announced more than $23 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, according to the Pentagon report from last year. In 2020 alone, authorizations totaled more than $5 billion. The sales included advanced unmanned aerial systems, long-range missiles and artillery, and anti-ship missiles.

Taiwan’s annual defense budget is more than 2 percent of its gross domestic product. President Tsai Ing-wen has increased the annual figure by modest amounts.

Both U.S. and Taiwanese officials say Taiwanese troops need better training, but each government wants the other to take more responsibility.

“The Taiwanese troops barely have opportunities to conduct exercises with the allies,” said Shu Hsiao-huang, a researcher at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, which is funded by the government of Taiwan. “Military cooperation between Taiwan and the United States should be strengthened in the aspects of regional exercises and the deployment of weapons.”

Ms. Glaser said Taiwan needed to create a strong reserve force and territorial defense force that could wear down an invading military, as the Ukrainians did.

“The U.S. has encouraged Taiwan’s military for years to talk to countries with a robust defense force,” she said. “Taiwan has sent delegations to Israel, Singapore, Finland, Sweden, some of the Baltic States. Now the situation is far more serious and far more urgent. There’s a lot more pressure.”

That was an ideological based political decision to abandon South Vietnam, not a result of poor analysis. And the only human factor involved was the very individuals who made the decisions.  

Or Afghanistan 2021. Every single uniformed member of the Joint Chiefs, CENTCOM, and those in Afghanistan recommended against the plan adopted by the White House, who did it because one politician and probably some civilian staffers decided they thought it was the best course of action. They literally were the human factor involved in that disaster, and yet they were also the decision makers too.  

Or Ukraine 2022. Putin and top leadership of the FSB and MOD fall into the trap believing the Ukrainians wouldn't fight back. Again, they're the human factor that failed in the intelligence estimation and they are also the decision makers.  

My criticism on your comments about certain historical examples you listed was to show the issues of using inaccurate generalizations bordering on the hyperbolic to try to make a point about perceived issues and solutions. If you're trying to prove that x + y = z then you can't have earlier gotten the earlier equation to find for x grossly wrong, it undermines everything that comes after it. Which is itself a problem that affects intelligence estimations that can't be factored in, the human factor when the data is garbage. Is there a mathematical answer to know when the mathematicians get the formulas wrong?  

I am in 100% agreement in the power of the human factor in warfare, which is why I personally lean towards military science actually being military art, because it isn't actually scientific or quantifiable. AKA, so much of the math involved in all of this is pure bullshit, at least IMO.

Two interesting points mentioned were: 1) the allies still haven't decided whether to scale the operation up to something equivalent to the Berlin airlift, and 2) USA still won't provide long range MLRS because of fears of escalation.

I think what he was referring to was strategic offensives, with the goal of seizing strategic objectives. While small, the current Severodonetsk salient battle still qualifies, since reducing it ""liberates"" the entirety of Luhansk oblast, a strategic objective in line with the shift to Donbas the Russians had after abandoning the Kyiv front. 

Should this campaign end and they only slice off part of the salient, they might still launch further attacks down the road that are still part of the overall Donbas strategic plan. 

More so, even if they can't perform any further strategic offensives beyond the Donbas that doesn't mean they will stop attacking altogether. They can still attack to achieve tactical and operational level goals, and if the situation arises they might even try a further strategic offensive in the future. 

An example is Germany in WW2. By 1943 they only had the ability to launch on strategic offensive and that was a very limited one against the Kursk salient, done not only to flatten the front lines (and free up a large number of divisions), but also to show their Axis allies that they were not done on the offense. But the Kursk attack failed and was immediately followed up by a massive Soviet offensive that they couldn't stop, and from that point onwards they are characterized as having been forced into the strategic defense. However, they still performed strategic offensives, such as the Ardenne Offensive in late 1944, which was both an attempt to shatter the western Allies to buy time to reinforce the East and possibly have the forces to launch a massive offensive there. That was followed shortly thereafter with a much more limited offensive against the Alsace section of the Allied line in early 1945, which also failed. Which was then followed by a large scale counteroffensive in Hungary in March 1945. 

I think that is what Kofman wants to point out. That just because people are saying truthfully that Russia will soon be too weak to launch any further strategic offensives that it doesn't mean they can't attack.",b6f67594d35f8c1ac800e8b9c78f94e50c7fe61a,True,False,,,,,0,1653497124,,0,{},i9ye06l,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_i9y1914,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/i9ye06l/,1653497135,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653468324.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;The reason why intelligence estimates are so bad at predicting the outcome of armed conflict is due to the fact that we do not know how much will to fight lies in the heart of the people who fight wars.

The human element is just one tiny sliver of one piece many analysts fail to consider, which ultimately is why making predictions on warfare is impossible, one cannot know how people will think and no mathematical formula is going to fix that. Whether you use a calculator or try to take omens from the pattern of bird sign or take omens from the entrails of a goat, you can't know what you can't know and you can only guess. And when people guess they're often wrong.  

But besides that, another issue that causes intelligence estimates to fail is due to simplification of the situation through generalizing, which simplifies a situation to the point that nearly all value from the lessons that can be learned are lost. For instance, Let's look at some generalizations you made to show the dangers of it: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the collapse of the Iraqi military in the fight against ISIS

But only part of ISF collapsed, while other parts didn't. Certain units did VERY poorly and routed, some units conducted organized retreats, some held their ground, and some others (like ISOF) immediately started counterattacking.  

Now if one wanted to use the 2014 DAESH offensive as an example, isn't it better to actually go into great detail to ensure the right lessons are learned? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the collapse of the Iraqi Army against the coalition in 1991

Another example of the dangers of generalization. 

Who exactly collapsed? Yep, a whole lot of Iraqi units the Saddam Line surrendered enmass, but many others fought on with such determination that bulldozers plowed sand into their trenches to bury them alive. Then there were the numerous Iraqi mechanized brigades and divisions (basically every unit in their operational reserve) who counterattacked or reacted to the Left Hook by attempting to form blocking positions to slow the Coalition advance to allow the strategic retreat to occur that the Iraqi high command had ordered, culminating in the battles of 73 Easting, Objective Norfolk, and Medina Ridge where US forces had to fight through them.  

It seems what you are wanting to emphasize is the overly cautious prebattle casualty/resistance estimates that overstated the Iraqi capabilities. But there is reason for that, as anyone who works in military intelligence will tell you its better to err on overestimating your enemy than underestimating. Nobody realized at that point how poor the Iraqi military actually was, everyone was overly focused on size, composition, experience and supposed competence to understand that they weren't all that good but mostly that the Coalition forces (namely the US, British, French) were just very good. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the fast defeat of South Vietnam's forces against the North's in 1975

The North Vietnamese violated the Paris Accords knowing the US wouldn't abide by the treaty requirements due to the 1973 War Powers Resolution (which also overcame Nixon's veto) that prohibited further US military support without Congressional approval which obviously wasn't going to come, coupled with the oil prices causing major gasoline shortage for the ARVN, a mechanized army (thanks to the US efforts to organize them that way), while also being denied the arms and ammo they needed, done in conjunction with a massive fully conventional ground offensive. 

And we're going to blame this on the an intel estimate missing the human factor? Seriously? The human factor that was missed was those in the US govt who years before made a series of strategic decisions culminating in an unfavorable outcome that was destined to occur, then being upset it happened faster than they hoped. And then only being upset about how fast because of the bad press it got them. This is the same exact thing that happened with Afghanistan recently. 

""Our former allies collapsed faster than we guessed they would after we made the direct decision to abandon them, and we caught a lot of PR flak that we would rather avoid next time. So let's find out how we can make reforms in the intelligence apparatus so they can anticipate our own incompetent decision making in the future.""",cc1a9906a413115aa377463be7a476a25e613065,True,False,,,,,0,1653496563,,0,{},i9yckax,False,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9y17tt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9yckax/,1653496574,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653467763.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Great question. I think it's a mix of both, plus other issues, namely the doctrine they're using. 
  
Ukraine does have a massive reserve being assembled but also needs to train it to make it useful and that takes time. A lot of their reserves and most of their TDF are near useless for most operations besides static defense, they would be especially poor at anything relating to offensive warfare. While most aren't ready now they will be more ready roughly at the time the Russians can no longer continue on the offensive due to attrition, which is going to be by mid summer period. 

Supplying that counteroffensive is an entirely different story. I really don't know enough about what they have left of their own stocks and what in total NATO has given them. Its probably not enough to do a large scale counteroffensive, but enough for a localized one. 
  
In terms of actual fighting ability to conduct a counteroffensive, that is extremely tricky. Has the UAF even shown they can attack Russian strong points? That's the biggest deciding factor I think, since from the beginning of the war most (all?) of their successful counterattacks have been against Russian weak points that were either identified by ISR or by happenstance because the Russians were strung out, lacked resources, lacked combined arms, lacked fires, etc. But had the UAF driven into the teeth of a well positioned Russian force who have ample fires and ISR, how would they do? In all honesty, without very effective air cover, I don't think they'd do all that well. They will need massive fires superiority and numbers too, or else such unbelievable overmatch in competence/skill that its like pro boxers fighting toddlers (which isn't the reality). So when they do attack strongpoints in the future, I think they're going to have issues. 

But I think they know that and have tried to plan around it for the time being at least. 

Much has been made of how much America in particular has transformed the Ukraine senior officer corps especially, who seem to be favoring an active defense, best defined as a highly mobile defense, retaining an aggressive focus and not just reacting and fighting from static positions. Its characterized by elastic defenses/defense in depth, trading space for time and blood, lots of preplanned and hasty ambushes and firesacks, shoot and scoot fast fights, lots of counterattacks against weak points, spoiling attacks to sabotage enemy plans, with the few static defensive positions assisted by highly technical and lethal weaponry allowing smaller forces to accrue very high kill ratios, all in the hope the ""stronger"" enemy (Soviet Union and now Russia) gases out before friendly defenses break, at least the ones the matter. Once they are sufficiently weakened to the point they can't go on the strategic offensive anymore, then flip it and counteroffensive as fast as possible before they have time to recover, consolidate, etc. 

That has all the hallmarks of American involvement in planning too, as the above is copying the US Army's Active Defense doctrine that was policy for how to fight the Soviet Union from the late 70s and into the early 80s. It sounds very impressive, but even when it was immediately release it caused controversy because it had lots of flaws. 

For instance, sometimes one can't only attack weak points. Do they have the plans and ability to attack strong points? The old doctrine didn't address the enemy's reserves and second echelon, which the Soviet Union (and Russians) are famous for organizing when trying to conduct breakthrough attacks. 

Which is exactly what happened at Popansa. The UA units defending the town bloodied the Russians untold times, for about a month the Russians were launching regular attacks trying to take the city and failing every time, and they just kept sending more units and firing more arty battering the defenders, who were weakening every time. For whatever reason, the Russians finally pushed the UA out of the village and then immediately exploited it with a largescale attack by a large and fresh second echelon operational maneuver group, that rushed forward through Popansa to attack preplanned positions beyond it. And that worked, they broke through either before the Ukraine could set up their next fall back positions, or they broke through in spite of them. They weren't able to achieve their full goals, but it does seem they were able to move north far enough to cut one of the two main MSRs leading deep into the salient, while endangering the others.  
   
So I think the UA fucked up. Not intentional, not through incompetence, but because there was a reason Active Defense was replaced by AirLand Battle only a few years after it was released. Because those pesky fresh reserves and second echelon OMG who in every field exercise or computer simulation was able to break through the defenses that had held against the previous attacks while being battered along the way, taking losses, using up ammo that hadn't been replaced, losing access to their best primary fighting positions, who can't hold forever. What needs to happen is the weakened defenses need to be relieved regularly (not easy in the midst of battle) and/or they need to target the second echelon threat behind the front lines so the ground defenses don't need to fight them at al. Which is what AirLand Battle was all about: deep air support/air interdiction of the rear to target those massive columns (like the ""40 mile"" convoy north of Kyiv that the Ukrainians couldn't destroy but the USAF specializes in destroying), large scale assembly areas, etc, all defended by ADA that friendly air has to defeat too (requiring high levels of proficiency in SEAD/DEAD).  

Nobody in the US Army or NATO talked much about the follow on stage of the war, it all seems to have focused on stopping the Warsaw Pact ground attack and then ENDEX. There didn't seem to be any sort of real planning to retake everything they lost, and I don't think the UA have gotten that far in planning either. I think they want to retake it, but wanting doesn't mean much.",b4622852dab220338c65120e9da2f959800346d7,True,False,,,,,0,1653493506,,0,{},i9y4qal,False,t3_uxfrv9,False,True,t1_i9xg0du,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxfrv9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_25_2022/i9y4qal/,1653493518,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653464706.0

But the problem is much deeper than just the recent war. The report the other day about Afghanistan's security forces/military collapse was another failure of US intelligence to accurately predict how a fight would go, the collapse of the Iraqi military in the fight against ISIS, the collapse of the Iraqi Army against the coalition in 1991, the fast defeat of South Vietnam's forces against the North's in 1975, etc.

There has been a long history of consistently failing to take the human factor into account in wars, it is even laughable that it has taken so long to do so.

The US Army brass realized this mistake and commissioned the Rand Corp to study this issue, the result is this 274 paper. It comes at the problem from the perspective of trying to model the problem for wargaming. Frankly the modeling piece did not interest me very much, but as each aspect of the model is discussed there is an examination of the aspect that is very informative. The historical examples of the concepts were very compelling and helped me to understand the importance of them. 

The lack of importance of leadership was a big surprise for me, perhaps we over emphasize this factor in modern militaries. And the point about stragglers not being properly indicative of the units they come from was enlightening as well. There have been several guesses that the Russian military could collapse any day now, due to the soldiers who have surrendered and are disaffected, this study however would indicate that this is not the case as these men are not indicative of these units as a whole. 

As it examines each factor this report goes into detail on what makes a good soldier on avery basic level and perhaps even a look at humanity itself as well. I would recommend this paper to anyone who wants to understand war at the macro level of organization of militaries, and the micro level of individual soldier qualities that are most important. 

I wish this paper was shorter so more people would read it, but it is definitely worth the time and effort as many shorter submissions.

&gt; * It would be difficult to read any version of the Omaha Beach story and believe that the right weapons or tactics alone won the day. This was an event driven in great part by human psychology and human agency. If the soldiers from the 116th Regi- ment had been automatons, they would have moved unhesitatingly forward rather than abandoning their equipment in the water, thus surviving to fight another day. Lieutenant Taylor would have followed a tactical subroutine demanding he build a 3:1 numerical advantage before attacking. Instead, these real-life soldiers made real-life human decisions based on their dispositions and decisions to fight. 

&gt; * On the other side, German soldiers did not unhesitatingly sit behind their machine guns. They faced the greatest landing fleet ever assembled in human history. Many of them probably knew they were fighting a hopeless delaying action. In his memoir of the battle, German machine gunner Heinrich Severloh recalls thinking, “Dear God, why have you abandoned me? . . . My only thought was, ‘How can I get away from here?’ ”2 But Severloh stayed and fought, as did thousands of other German soldiers across the Normandy coast that day.3 They probably did so for many reasons that would have been familiar to the Americans coming across the beach into the beaten zones of the German’s fire: duty, honor, comradeship, nationalism, leadership, discipline, and training.4 

&gt; * Messy human reality gives way to the neat and clean world of quantifiable data, and will to fight is relegated to easily overlooked one- paragraph doctrinal nods to Clausewitz. 

&gt; * Advisors should be trained to assess will to fight, and forms used to analyze and illustrate combat effectiveness should include a structured section on will to fight. Analyses of adversary, or potential adversary, will to fight should be similarly grounded in order to meet standards for analytic integrity. 

&gt; * We studied 202 scholarly sources potentially relevant to understanding the will to fight, ultimately retaining 110 of those sources for inclusion in the coded review. We used the review of the 92 sources we did not code to inform our broader research. 

&gt; * Thus an important caveat to our study is that there is a source bias toward the West. While there is broad consensus on the importance of cohesion in will to fight, this may reflect a Western bias. For example, we note that revenge appears in all three of the studies we read that focused on nonstate actors—the relative infrequency of revenge cited as a factor may be a result of bias in the literature toward Western militaries, which are built on cohesion, ideological commitment, unit morale, and esprit de corps. 

&gt; * We found high will to fight to be associated with state and national issues of economic independence, social and political indoctrination (or coercive discipline and ideology), government willing- ness to take risks, high cohesion within the military, merit-based culture, and taking the operational offensive against a defensive adversary. 

&gt; * Low will to fight was associated with incompetence of leadership, regardless of the legitimacy of government. History mattered: A history of poor leadership and military failure suggested low will to fight. Economic dependency, situational and temporary hatred of the adversary, and low military cohesion also correlated with low will to fight. We were surprised to find that legitimacy of leadership and military obedience had no discernible relationship with will to fight in any direction. 

&gt; * In the cases we examined, historico-cultural context was exceptionally important in understanding will to fight at the societal, state, and organizational levels of analysis. In the Vietnam War case the differences between northern and southern history and cultural context had a clear and perhaps decisive impact on compara- tive will to fight. 
&gt; * There do not appear to be any unitary theories that explain will to fight in any one case. Factors that appeared to have the most influence on will to fight changed significantly from case to case. 
&gt; * Even the most conventional, head-to-head combat cases that lent themselves to the most detailed quantitative and mechanistic analyses had significant will-to- fight components. The ebb of French will to fight in the later stages of World War I changed a battlefield dynamic that otherwise looked fairly evenly matched. 
&gt; * U.S. Army and Marine Corps emphasis on leadership, realistic training, mission-type orders, esprit de corps, discipline, and morale all stems in part from an array of French, British, and officially sponsored American analyses of will to fight.1 

&gt; * The Army went on to sponsor further research into force morale and cohesion, particularly after the Vietnam War and during the initial period of the All-Volunteer Force.3 This interest and effort are reflected in the surge in morale and cohesion litera- ture in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

&gt; * …it is not proven that leaders are the main source of will in every case. There are many cases where leadership appeared to be the key element in will to fight, but there is no causal proof to support this explanation of will to fight. Our research shows that good leadership is primarily an enabler of will to fight. But it is not true that units inevitably disintegrate when commanders break. There are many instances in both twentieth- and twenty-first-century warfare when commanders have broken in combat but units have carried on with new commanders—including noncommissioned offi- cers—in charge. 

&gt; * For Metz and other RMA proponents, technology in the form of advanced information systems and precision strikes would change what they saw as the not-so- enduring nature of war.36 Human factors like will to fight would be far less relevant than the technical and material aspects of warfare.37 In this view, Desert Storm was a lesson in the dominance of technology rather than in the importance of will to fight.38 Most RMA publications barely mentioned the human aspect of war…

&gt; * Mentions of Clausewitz began to elicit some audible groans in Marine Corps classrooms. 

&gt; * …there was no structured effort to assess the will to fight of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) between 2002 and 2010. For the first eight years of the war, advisors used a variety of color-coded checklists that ignored or buried human aspects of combat effectiveness.5 

&gt; * Military doctrine that ignores or underplays the impor- tance of will to fight signals an emphasis on hard-factor warfare. It encourages the kind of mechanistic thinking that undermined U.S. strategy in Vietnam and led to the overly enthusiastic promises of the RMA. Mechanistic thinking that ignores the human ele- ment of warfare sets the stage for anything from limited failure to outright catastrophe in future wars.",1ace3e79b87e781100269a4adb48e65aa90f7f11,True,False,,,,,0,1653490469,,0,{},i9xx6dv,True,t3_uxiyy5,False,False,t1_i9xwazq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9xx6dv/,1653490485,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653461669.0

&gt; * The closer an organization’s doctrine matches each situation, and the more effective that doctrine proves to be in combat, the more confidence soldiers and units will have in the organization. Greater confidence coincides with improved will to fight. 

&gt; * In many historical cases the military is seen as less corrupt than the state; this is often the basis for military coups. 

&gt; * (1) *Will to fight should never be considered simply as a sum, average, or weighted average of the factors;* (2) applying the will-to-fight model requires both holistic and factor-by-factor assessment or analysis; and (3) there is no fixed approach to assessing or analyzing will to fight. A narrative description, a more detailed subfac- tor assessment, or a less-detailed approach focusing on a few selected factors might be appropriate for specific military uses in any one case. 

&gt; * One of the clearest ways to study the major impact of will to fight in war is through war gaming and simulation. War gaming and simulation would be an effective way to explore the RAND Arroyo Center will-to-fight model proposed in Chapter Two or any other model of will to fight. 

&gt; * Surprise is a common modifier that typically exacerbates the negative effect of attacks. For example, a surprise air attack is more likely to degrade friendly will to fight than one spotted by friendly observation ahead of time. 

&gt; * Lord Moran describes the terrorizing effect of artillery fire and the varying abilities of soldiers to maintain their will to fight under artillery fire over time.13 The use of chemical, biologi- cal, radiological, or even flame weapons like a close-in flamethrower can have equally deleterious effects on will to fight.14 U.S. Army ADP 3-90 states that surprise “induces psychological shock in enemy soldiers and leaders.”15 The Marine Corps describes sur- prise as a “state of disorientation resulting from an unexpected event that degrades the enemy’s ability to resist.”16 In other words, surprise is specifically designed to reduce will to fight. 

&gt; * U.S. Army armored units are purposefully designed to instill shock in the enemy: Fear of an anthropomorphic armored steel beast capable of rending flesh with heavy shells or machine guns or crushing soldiers under its treads is endemic. Fear of armor can reduce will to fight in all but the most experienced, well-trained, and capable infantry soldiers.17 

&gt; * Observing adversary surrender can have the opposite effect. Surrender generally reduces fear of the enemy, particularly when soldiers see unarmed enemy with their hands over their heads, demoralized and unthreatening. 

&gt; * The U.S. military rou- tinely studies fatigue because it is recognized as a source of degraded mental state and performance.19 Lord Moran devoted a separate chapter to exposure, or the effects of harsh weather conditions on the mental state of soldiers. He wrote: “The harsh violence of winter may find a flaw even in picked men.”20 

&gt; * Individual behavior often has a knock-on effect on unit behavior. Heroic actions often trigger heroism or reduce fear in fellow soldiers.23 Understanding how collective behavioral actions can be triggered and play out is helpful in assessing or analyzing both positive and harmful unit behaviors. Mili- tary historians, military psychologists, and other experts who study battle—including modeling and simulations experts—describe trigger points for mass aggression or mass flight or surrender.24 This is also sometimes referred to as a cascading effect, and it can transfer within a unit and from unit to unit across a battlefield. 

&gt; * Even if we were able to identify and describe all of these factors, it still would not be possible to accurately predict the outcome of combat. However, estimation and fore- casting are possible and warranted. Many of the adversary factors and some of the exogenous factors can be known ahead of time and used in a comparative analysis with the unit will-to-fight model. 

&gt; * In most war games and simulations and in many calculations of combat effectiveness, veteran military units are automatically assumed to have greater will to fight. This is a dangerous oversimplification of veterancy. It does not match existing research. 

&gt; * Soldiers in the Swank and Marchand study reported intense anxiety in the first few days of combat as they were in a “constant state of fluctuating fear.”30 This pro- duced physiological change, including increased urination, thirst, and sweating. But after the first week the soldiers adapted. Between day 10 and day 30 from D-Day they reached a period of maximum efficiency as they became used to enemy fire and more confident in their own capabilities. From day 30 to day 40 they entered a period of combat exhaustion, beginning with a hyperreactive stage that included a brief period of overconfidence. At this point, short periods of rest became insufficient to reset soldier confidence and capability. This overlapped into a 15-day period of emotional exhaus- tion, culminating for some in a vegetative state. Figure 3.1 is Artelli’s adaptation of Swank and Marchand’s original diagram. 

&gt; * None of the military war games or simulations we assessed gave priority to will to fight as the most or even one of the most important factors in war.48 In fact, with the exception of a few limited experiments and an occasional nod to the suppres- sive effects of weapon fire or casualty loss ratios, none of these games or simula- tions includes a serious effort to model will to fight. 

&gt; * U.S. military organizations have made a few other limited efforts to incorporate will to fight into gaming and simulation. However, as of mid-2018 we were not able to identify a publicly available body of empirical, replicable testing sufficient to prove the value of full implementation of a will-to-fight model. We conducted experimental test- ing to help rectify the gap. 

&gt; * Results from our analysis of existing war games and simulations, interviews with game designers and program managers, and our game and simulation testing showed that will to fight is inadequately represented in official military models. If will to fight is one of the most important factors in war, and if it is absent or poorly represented in military gaming and simulation, then there is a dangerous gap in existing military games and simulations. It is possible that results from official military games and simulations are misleading, and have been for quite some time.",ad3fb85c15e3c6a1f3f0f06e172bc4a5a8f4954f,True,False,,,,,0,1653490445,,0,{},i9xx4a9,True,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9xwazq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9xx4a9/,1653490461,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653461645.0

&gt; * In training environments military leaders often test expectations to test resilience. For example, at the very end of a long training march with full combat load a leader might take a sudden turn away from the barracks and add a mile to the route to test soldiers’ willingness to continue in the face of broken expectations. 

&gt; * Our analysis shows that leadership is better described as an enabler of will to fight. Good leaders can help keep units together, while bad leaders can weaken both individual and collective dis- position to fight.82 But units can and do fight despite bad leadership. 

&gt; * Lord Moran provides some of the best analysis of control and the trade-offs between coercion and persuasion. Here he describes two different approaches to discipline in the English (British) Army:92 

*“The discipline of the English Army in the early days of the Peninsular War was modeled on the methods of Frederick the Great. It was control from without in its crudest, most brutal shape; men did their job because the fear of flogging was greater than the fear of death. Sir John Moore . . . swept away Frederick’s influ- ence. . . . He left a creed in which the English Army still believes, a creed sup- ported by a faith in human nature. He insisted that the men should be treated as human beings. The officers must know their men, be their friend and look after their wants; even orders were to be given in the language of moderation. It was a discipline of kindness, an appeal to the heart inspired by mutual respect, affection, and comradeship.”*

&gt; * All military units apply a mix of both approaches to build and maintain the disposition to fight. A good example is the Peoples Army of Vietnam. It was a highly coercive force that also relied very heavily on informal persuasion, ideological encouragement, and praise for performance. It also applied ideological control, a measure that tends to have both coercive and persuasive components. PAVN officers proved expert at applying ideologi- cal control through the use of propaganda, small-group discussions, and political loy- alty tests. Soviet political officers similarly applied ideological coercion and persuasion at the unit level. Ideological control is directly linked with individual soldier ideology. 

&gt; * Many analysts equate control, and specifically coercion, with discipline. In this interpretation, discipline is the application of authority and regulation to obtain obe- dience. But discipline is in fact something more complex. 

&gt; * There are effectively two archetypes of discipline. Absolute control reflects the extreme of externally controlled discipline. Self-motivation is the extreme of internally motivated discipline. Absolute control is top-down coercion met with total obedience. It is leader centric, and therefore heavily dependent on leader competence and char- acter. 

&gt; * Individually motivated discipline is soldier centric. Leaders provide guidance and expect soldiers to perform within standards of their own volition. The concept of mission-type orders, or mission command, depends on this kind of devolved responsi- bility and decisionmaking.95 

&gt; * Neither extreme exists in practice; all units perform a complex mix of both approaches. Neither approach is inherently better. Instead of indicating positive or negative value, the type of discipline that exists in a unit reveals potential strengths and weaknesses in will to fight. A highly controlled unit may be more vulnerable to break- downs in leadership and support, but it might be less vulnerable to measures aimed at breaking down individual soldiers. It would arguably be more capable of addressing gaps in soldier quality and competence. The opposite might be true of a unit that relies more on self-discipline. 

&gt; * Historian Hew Strachan argues that training is perhaps the most effective confidence-building measure and the greatest contributor to the disposition to fight:

*“The value of training is therefore in large part psychological: it is an enabling process, a form of empowerment, which creates self-confidence. . . . Surprise can destroy collective cohesion on the battlefield and training is its best antidote.”*

&gt; * However, in general, highly competent units tend to believe in their ability to succeed. This belief contributes to confidence. In turn, confidence is generally associated with stronger will to fight. 

&gt; * Some units are more capable than others of continuing to maintain will to fight without sufficient or timely support. 

&gt; * Our review of will-to- fight related literature, our interviews with organizational military leaders and experts, and our case study examinations showed that the most important aspect of organiza- tional integrity for will-to-fight considerations is corruption.117 Corruption can have a profound impact on individual perceptions of the organization and their willingness to fight for it over time. 

&gt; * Every military organization in every country has some level of corruption. It would be unrealistic and unhelpfully demure to avoid this discomforting reality. However, U.S. military organizational integrity is exception- ally high in comparison with that of most other global military forces. It is high not because corruption is absent but because the organization constantly seeks to maintain high standards for integrity and in most cases swiftly and harshly punishes corrupt practices. 

&gt; * Observers of the Iraqi military argue that corruption directly undermined the military’s ability to counter the Islamic State in 2014, helped feed the collapse of will to fight in places like Fallujah and Mosul, hindered its efforts to recover from these initial defeats, and was a drag on its efforts to regain the initiative.123 Deeply corrupt practices typically have a corrosive effect on will to fight wherever they exist.124",537fab841ea41d87273f0fe56622018e983407fc,True,False,,,,,0,1653490375,,0,{},i9xwy5f,True,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9xwazq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9xwy5f/,1653490392,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653461575.0

&gt; * Marine Private First Class Hector Cafferata offers another example of the potential differences between happiness, orderliness, and the disposition and decision to fight. Cafferata was part of the First Marine Division in the Korean War. In 1950 his unit was surrounded on a hilltop outpost above the Toktong Pass, fighting a desperate holding battle to allow the outnumbered U.S. ground units to escape a massive Chi- nese offensive.25 Temperatures plummeted at night to –33°F. Dead bodies were piled up around the Marines. Water was in short supply. Every Marine was exhausted from constant fighting. Most of them were suffering from chronic diarrhea. Few were clean- shaven. They were all eating half-thawed, gelatinous canned food. The Marines’ feelings about their situation—surrounded, frozen, sick, thirsty, malnourished, exhausted, and terrified—manifested in expressions, postures, and statements that might have given the impression of low morale.26 

&gt; * But when the Chinese executed a human wave attack in the middle of the night, Cafferata and his entire unit fought hard. Cafferata came out of his cold sleeping bag and killed over a dozen enemy soldiers. He batted away a grenade with his rifle and lost part of his hand throwing back another grenade. His Medal of Honor citation credits him with helping to hold the line and win the battle. Why did Cafferata choose to fight under such conditions? In his own words, he fought because of his pride in being a Marine, because his identity as a Marine conveyed a sense of duty, and because of his cohesion with his comrades. 

&gt; * An outsider might have looked at Fox Company the night before the Chinese assault and seen miserable Marines on the verge of collapse. But a more astute observer might have seen the emer- gence of a different, deeper reflection of morale stemming from unit identity, expert competence, organizational esprit de corps, cohesion, and leadership. Exogenous con- ditions that portend low morale can indeed degrade will to fight, but they can also make it stronger by causing individuals to hew closer to the factors that matter most in times of crisis. 

—————————————

&gt; * The RAND Arroyo Center model is a guide to assessment and analysis. Each factor and subfactor should be considered for each case, then either explored in greater detail, set aside for future analysis, or discarded. Every assessment or analysis of will to fight requires different levels of detail, has different objectives, and must be accomplished with different resources and on different timelines. For example, an Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) team leader tasked with assessing the will to fight of an allied military platoon may use it to quickly fine-tune a field training plan or deliver a rapid narrative assessment to higher headquarters 

&gt; * Our literature review showed that better educated, more stable, more sociable, and more capable soldiers who are confident of performing in combat are generally more disposed to fight, with all other factors being equal.32 

&gt; * *Identity, Desperation, Revenge, Economy, Ideology* are the Motivations

&gt; * Individual capabilities fall into two general categories: (1) soldier quality and (2) competence. Quality is the basic mental and physical capability of the individual. It consists of education, social skills, fitness, psychological traits, adaptability, and resilience. 

&gt; * Social skills are the skills to develop cohesive bonds with peers and leaders. In general, a group of soldiers inept at forming social bonds would be less likely to form social cohesion, and therefore somewhat less likely to fight.52 Fitness is physical ability and conditioning—is the soldier physically capable of fighting or acting as needed? A strong and capable body tends to impart confidence in performance, which contributes positively to will to fight. Fitness has been shown to reduce anxiety, and anxiety gener- ally undermines will to fight.53 In general, anything that generates confidence in the ability to fight—including quality training, good leadership, and so on—improves will to fight, although even extraordinary confidence can be undone in any one case by any one overriding factor.54 There is no magical, additive formula of individual qualities that guarantees dependable, mission-focused will to fight. 

&gt; * In a generally functional and competent military organization, soldiers tend to expect their leaders to be competent, to care for them, and to risk lives only when necessary. They expect units to their left and right to perform their missions and to keep everyone’s flanks secure. Soldiers expect the higher units and the organization to provide supplies, medical support, and reinforcements. At the highest levels they expect state leaders to remain committed to their mission, to provide them with clear objectives, and to rally public or moral support. Soldiers also expect the society to pro- vide that support. Sustained expectations correlate with sustained disposition to fight. Broken expectations can weaken and even shatter soldiers’ will to fight. Unit-level expectations and individual resilience are closely linked. 

&gt; * For example, American military forces try to apply the so-called golden-hour rule to casualty evacuation. Units forward position helicopters and ambulances to ensure wounded are rapidly evacuated to a surgical facility within one hour. Evidence has emerged from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq showing that the golden hour saves lives. It also has a perceived effect on will to fight. 

&gt; * Low expectations can lower will to fight, but low expectations can also inoculate a unit against disappointment. If soldiers do not expect good performance, leadership, or support, they are less likely to have their hopes dashed in combat at a moment when they are already under significant stress. 

&gt; * An example from the Vietnam War helps describe expectation vis-à-vis will to fight. In 1975… many ARVN units fought tooth and nail to defend southern cities. Along with some attachments the 18th Division—a unit that had been lambasted by American generals in previous years— fiercely defended the city of Xuan Loc as part of what its own commander recognized to be a losing strategic effort.74 Even though many southern soldiers were resigned to eventual defeat, they initially fought on for a variety of interrelated reasons: to defend their families, to avoid capture, out of a sense of duty and professionalism, to pro- tect one another, and because many of them held out a genuine or knowingly false expectation that the United States would intervene to save them at the last minute.",a76852970e6bd8e3c8c7f2391d6f57736a2a2771,True,False,,,,,0,1653490172,,0,{},i9xwg3k,True,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9xwazq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9xwg3k/,1653490187,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653461372.0
[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"&gt; * For over a century the foremost experts on will to fight have bemoaned the inability of Western military organizations to remain focused on its premises and practices. They see instead a center-rest return to the more tangible and intellectually obtain- able aspects of war like technology, training, and battlefield tactics. 

&gt; * Or they focus on internal will-to-fight issues but fail to concentrate on the issues most relevant to this report: the will to fight of allies and adversaries. These experts warn of the potentially disastrous impact of such discordant military practice. 

&gt; * There is a pattern in the wavering emphasis on will to fight.60 A major war occurs and Western literature on the will to fight dribbles forth. A few aspects of will to fight are incorporated into military practice, some are ignored, and some are embraced only after a decade or more of debate. Gradually the most painful lessons of war fade as combat veterans retire. Practicalities of technique, technology, and tactics shove the seemingly esoteric considerations of will to fight into the background. A new war erupts, painful lessons are briefly and only partly relearned, and then are again gradu- ally forgotten.61 The consequences of this ebb and flow stand testament to the pressing need to improve and normalize the study of will to fight in American military practice and to make its lessons useful. 

&gt; * While French will to fight was indeed suffering, the German assessment of French tactical-operational will to fight at Verdun was dangerously exaggerated and arguably wrong. German intelligence officers made two mistakes. First, they failed to account for the French noria system.66 French Général de Division Philippe Pétain, then com- mander of the Second Army’s Verdun salient, recognized that French soldiers were suffering from exhaustion. His noria reserve rotation plan was designed to provide soldiers rest, to rebuild their will to fight, and to ensure the Germans would face only fresh troops with strong will to fight.67 To the German intelligence officers, this rota- tion—designed to improve French will to fight—gave the appearance of thinned lines and weak will. 

&gt; * Second, the Germans assessed that the poor morale (or temporary feelings) of captured French troops amounted to poor will to fight among all French troops. 

&gt; * Yet it is possible—even common—to have poor individual will and strong collective, unit-level will to fight. Despite the external appearances given by poor prisoner morale, the French at Verdun were more than ready to hold the line against withering German artillery fire and bayonets. Falkenhayn’s entire plan rested on a false assumption about French will to fight, and the plan failed. 

&gt; * If he had had a better analysis method to help him understand French will to fight, he might have altered his plans. His hubris and jingoistic vision of Teutonic will to fight made the defeat at Verdun far more likely.74 Nothing can be done about hubris. Much can be done about will-to-fight analysis. 

&gt; * Failure to assess Arab will to fight in the 1973 Yom Kippur War nearly led to the destruction of Israel, and it pushed the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of war. Successful analyses of North Vietnamese will to fight from 1954 to 1974 were effectively ignored, leading to strategic defeat. Failure to assess Iraqi Army will to fight in 2011 contributed to the rise of the Islamic State and the continuation of a war that the United States had declared to be over in 2011.

&gt; * Israelis believed that Arabs had little or no will to fight. This Israeli perspective informed American perceptions of Arab military forces. Misconstrued lessons from the Six-Day War led Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysts to conclude that the relative will to fight of Israeli versus Arab soldiers would offset any foreseen Arab threat and even deter war. Arabs could not fight aggressively so they probably would not fight at all. These mistaken assumptions would underpin the wider intelligence failure that nearly led to the defeat of the Israeli military. 

&gt; * The case of the Vietnam War shows that even accurate intelligence analyses of will to fight are meaningless if they are ignored by decisionmakers. 

&gt; * Just three years after the last U.S. Army unit left Iraq, small groups of irregular, lightly armed Islamic State fighters defeated the Iraqi Army, seized over one-third of the entire country, and threatened to invest the capital. Four Iraqi Army divisions disintegrated without fighting. They abandoned their equipment and left fellow soldiers to face brutal execution. 

&gt; * It follows that if will to fight is essential to building American ground combat power, then it is also essential in understanding ally and adversary combat power. Yet external assessments and analyses focused on allies and adversaries have not followed theory. Neither service can show much effort toward assessing, analyzing, or influencing ally or adversary will to fight. 

&gt; * *Recent failure to translate military gains into strategic success reflects, to some extent, the Joint Force’s tendency to focus primarily on affecting the material capa- bilities—including hardware and personnel—of adversaries and friends, rather than their will to develop and employ those capabilities. . . . A failure to grasp human aspects can, and often will, result in a prolonged struggle and an inability to achieve strategic goals.*

&gt; * As the Joint Chiefs point out, these shortfalls are evident in the recent historical record. Failure to assess and act on will to fight may not have been causal in each case, but the American military track record since World War II has been poor. Various fail- ings in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq have led to a general decline in Ameri- can strategic performance: America is now a country that fails to win wars decisively. This decline in strategic performance happened even as American military technology and tactical acumen have advanced. Something is missing. 

&gt; * Improving understanding of will to fight might not be a panacea. But if it is the most important factor in war—or just *an* important factor in war that is routinely overlooked or misunderstood—then improvement is absolutely necessary. 

&gt; * We seek to aggregate many targeted analyses—Castillo’s, Pollock’s, King’s, Kellett’s, Siebold’s, and so on—into a holistic will-to-fight model. 

&gt; * Will to fight resides in both individuals and military units. It is impossible to delink the two: We cannot understand individual will to fight without understanding unit dynamics, or unit will to fight without the individual. We address both, but we tailor the model toward the unit because units are the focus of effort for military advis- ing and intelligence analysis. 

&gt; * In 1942 the U.S. Pacific Fleet translated a quantitative internal Japanese assessment of their morale problems. The American editor of the report wrote, “The entire report is a study in disaffection.”22 Yet despite their recorded morale and discipline problems, the Japanese Army proved to have extraordinary will to fight for most of the war. Neither job satisfaction nor martinet obedience is a consistent indicator of high morale or will to fight. 

&gt; * This also proved true in the Soviet Army during the Winter War against Finland from 1939 to 1940, where individual Soviet soldier morale was often quite low but unit will to fight held together: 

&gt; * *“Although Soviet soldiers did retreat, desert, surrender, shirk, and inflict wounds on themselves to get out of combat, and units were often deployed in disarray, none of these factors escalate to the point that they threatened to destroy the overall military effectiveness of the Soviet forces. . . . [D]espite tens of thousands of men killed, wounded, and captured, and vast losses of materiel, Soviet forces remained on the field of battle and continued to fight, although, with a few notable exceptions, more fiercely than well.”*",7ef31f82e242df6552147055d36a31e52ef18098,True,False,,,,,0,1653490114,,0,{},i9xwazq,True,t3_uxiyy5,False,True,t1_i9xw8qd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxiyy5/will_to_fight_analyzing_modeling_and_simulating/i9xwazq/,1653490126,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653461314.0

------------------------

Introduction:

Will to fight may be the single most important factor in war. The U.S. military accepts this premise: War is a human contest of opposing, independent wills. The purpose of using force is to bend and break adversary will. But this fundamental concept is poorly integrated into practice. The United States and its allies incur steep costs when they fail to place will to fight at the fore, when they misinterpret will to fight because it is ill-defined, or when they ignore it entirely. This report defines will to fight and describes its importance to the outcomes of wars. It gives the U.S. and allied militaries a way to better integrate will to fight into doctrine, planning, training, education, intelligence analysis, and military adviser assessments. It provides (1) a flexible, scalable model of will to fight that can be applied to any ground combat unit and (2) an experimental simulation model.

--------------------------

Quotes:

&gt; * …the purpose of the project was to explain will to fight at the unit level and to develop a model designed to support assessment of partner forces and analysis of adversary forces. 

&gt; * Both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps argue that will to fight is the single most important factor in war. 

&gt; * Soldiers can have very low dis- position to fight and still choose to fight in certain circumstances. For example, many soldiers with low disposition to fight will fight hard if they are cornered. 

&gt; * American understanding of will to fight needs significant improvement. 

&gt; * There Is No Generally Accepted Definition, Explanation, or Model of Will to Fight. Our literature review of 202 published works, U.S. and allied military doctrine, 68 subject matter expert interviews, and several hundred additional sources on specific historical cases, war gaming, and simulation revealed no generally accepted military or scientific definition, explanation, or model of will to fight. Further, there are no commonly accepted definitions or explanations of some of the key terms associated with will to fight, including morale, cohesion, and discipline. Our proposed definitions, explanations, and model are intended to help remedy this gap in general knowledge. 

&gt; * These oversights and missteps are dangerous and should be considered unacceptable: Will to fight is an inescapable and essential part of war. Failure to prioritize and constantly seek to improve our understanding of will to fight represents an ongoing threat to American military success and American security. 

&gt; * Morale does not explain, or by itself indicate, will to fight: Other experts offer the ill-defined term morale as a unitary theory: The way soldiers feel is equated with their disposition and decision to fight. This is not provable, nor is there any consis- tent definition of morale. Some use it to represent all aspects of will to fight—that morale is will to fight. We find that morale is instead a transient, partial indicator of will to fight that often has counterintuitive and misleading meanings. This term requires further analysis before it can be usefully modeled. 

&gt; * In the spring of 2000 a company of elite Russian paratroopers set in to what would be their final defensive position on Hill 776 in Chechnya’s remote Argun Gorge.1 Chechen rebels, including some hyperaggressive foreign fighters, had maneuvered through a dense fog to cut off the Russians and surround them. Only the men who fought on the hill know for sure what happened next: who was brave, who cowered in fear, and whether (as it was reported) the Russian commander actually called artillery down on his own position as the Chechens closed in. What is clear is that the Russians fought hard, almost to the last man. The Chechens fought just as hard, pressing home their attack under withering artillery, machine-gun, and rifle fire and suffering over 100 casualties. In the end the Russian company was destroyed. Many factors shaped the outcome of the Battle for Hill 776, including poor Russian decisionmaking, a huge numerical advantage for the Chechens, and bad weather. But one factor was critically important: the will to fight. Why did the Russians fight almost to the last man? Why did the Chechens press home their attack even as they suffered staggering casualties? These questions about will to fight get to the heart of combat, and to the enduring nature of war. Our report seeks answers. 

&gt; * Failure of will has signaled the ending of almost every military conflict in world history. Russian paratroopers on Hill 776 may have fought almost to the last man, but battles and wars tend to end in some form of capitulation rather than total annihilation.4 

&gt; * But will to fight is also affected and tested by immediate concerns in combat, like ceaseless barrages of enemy artillery, lack of sleep, extreme weather, and the constant fear of death. 

&gt; * Quantification of will to fight would be efficient and useful for the military. In an ideal world an allied or adversary unit could be assigned a precise number of “wills” that could then be built up or degraded. But disposition to fight and human agency defy meaningful quantification. Will to fight can be assessed and analyzed using a range of guiding factors: Military advisors assess the effectiveness of allied units, and intelligence professionals analyze adversary unit capacity.14 It can be quantified in simulation for notional battles. But will to fight cannot be measured the way that one measures a vehicle’s speed or a weapon’s range or a ship’s carrying capacity. 

&gt; * Will to fight matters, and it may be the single most important factor in war. But it is deeply frustrating to understand and explain. 

&gt; * Senior strategists in the U.S. Army are aware of the shortfalls in efforts to assess allied will to fight and analyze adversary will to fight. The U.S. Army sponsored our research to help bridge the gap between will-to-fight theory and practice.

Forsure you're correct.

Well it certainly has more credence then the ridiculous fantasy claims of WC Abhinandan shooting down a Pakistani F16 just before he went down, Indian Mirage 2000's penetrating 80km deep inside Pakistani territory or Indian strikes killing 300 people inside Balakot.

Two weeks ago he was [saying](https://twitter.com/JominiW/status/1525541781097652224) Ukraine was getting ready for a major counterattack, including a river crossing of the Dnieper. Clearly that was premature, and the idea that Ukraine is capable of conducting a contested river crossing of that scale is quite frankly a little ridiculous. Meanwhile ISW has made some very prescient calls, most famously being the among the first to say the Russian attack on Kyiv had failed, a decision they took a lot of heat for at the time but ultimately turned out to be correct.

I think the decision of what items to emphasize is always going to be a difficult one. ISW isn't saying that Severodonetsk isn't in danger of being encircled, they're just emphasizing less than ongoing Russian manpower and morale issues. Because as you say, the outcome of the Severodonetsk salient doesn't matter in the long run nearly as much as those things do. Indeed, probably the only way it would matter is if the Russians were able to capture a large number of Ukrainian troops without much of a fight, which ISW is taking a lot of time to say is not likely.

&gt;But in much of the rest of the world, the moral fervor evident in the Western response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine has been noticeably absent. Instead, countries like India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey and Indonesia have remained largely non-committal — acting mostly to protect their economic and strategic interests. Their particular policies toward the war vary. Some, such as India, have abstained from all U.N. resolutions aimed at punishing Russia. Others have voted for some of them. But all have refused to publicly chastise Russia, and some, notably India, have taken heat in the United States as a result. Even Saudi Arabia, which has long had close military ties with the United States, has spurned Washington’s request to pump more oil to ease price increases following the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia, whose output fell by a million barrels a day since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and continues to drop.

&gt;Some, such as India, have abstained from all U.N. resolutions aimed at punishing Russia. Others have voted for some of them. But all have refused to publicly chastise Russia, and some, notably India, have taken heat in the United States as a result. Even Saudi Arabia, which has long had close military ties with the United States, has spurned Washington’s request to pump more oil to ease price increases following the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia, whose output fell by a million barrels a day since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and continues to drop.  
&gt;  
&gt;What these countries have in common is that they tend to regard the war in Ukraine as a regional conflict — not, as the West does, a grave threat to global stability and the laws and norms underpinning the global order. Indeed, South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa, while not supporting Russia’s invasion, has opined that Washington’s dogged pursuit of NATO expansion contributed to revving up a crisis with Russia in Europe that eventually boiled over into war.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other countries have put their national interests above calls by the U.S. to isolate and sanction Russia. Israel and Turkey have not publicly condemned Russia, and are trying to safeguard important tangible benefits as well as the possibility of serving as mediators between Kyiv and Moscow. India, for its part, continues to value its economic ties with Russia, and since the invasion, has taken advantage of discounted prices to buy more than double the amount of Russian oil than it did in all of 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;These countries believe that international efforts should focus on promoting a negotiated settlement in Ukraine, not using the war as an occasion to isolate Russia, much less weaken it. The divergence of views ensures that U.S. efforts to relegate Russia to pariah status will fail — not because many countries support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but because they want to protect the particular benefits they derive from their relationship with Moscow. They also believe that publicly condemning Russia will do nothing to end the war in Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Though India and Pakistan have fought several wars against each other, their stances on the Ukraine war are similar — reflecting an unwillingness to risk antagonizing Russia. India has had a close relationship with Moscow since the mid-1950s. Though it is now much less reliant on Russian weaponry and has extensive economic and security ties with the U.S, Russia remains its biggest military supplier, accounting for nearly half of Indian defense imports. Russia has also started cultivating Pakistan. In sharp contrast to its India-centered policy during the Cold War, Moscow has supplied Pakistan a limited quantity of arms and, since 2016, has also held joint exercises with the Pakistani military. Little wonder that Khan refused to be goaded into taking sides on the Ukraine war — and that his successor, Shehbaz Sharif, hasn’t changed course.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then there’s Brazil, whose $1.4 trillion economy — Latin America’s largest — is deeply dependent on agricultural sales, which Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has made a priority to promote. Soybeans, Brazil’s top agricultural export, bring in nearly $29 billion. Cultivating that crop requires fertilizer, and Brazil imports 85 percent of what it needs, and Russia accounts for 23 percent of those imports. Would Russia end its fertilizer sales if Brazil started supporting Western sanctions against Moscow? Bolsonaro doesn’t want to find out. Brazil did vote for a March 2 U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning Russia but its ambassador’s explanation of the vote pointedly criticized “the indiscriminate application of sanctions” and the denunciation of Russia’s resort to war.",74a3d5edc185f3a37ed34e8bd28f51bff31b6e1b,True,False,,,,,0,1653471943,,0,{},i9wzw0z,False,t3_uwp5x4,False,True,t3_uwp5x4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwp5x4/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_24_2022/i9wzw0z/,1653471957,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653443143.0

The Russians don't even need to assault those cities if they cut off the supply lines, then they can just starve them out. There are two roads that lead to that area of the salient from the west and the more important of the two was already cut and the second isnt that far away from where the Russians. If they cut both, and can't hold the roadblocks, no one gets in and out, unless UAF can fight through and break-out or break-in into the encirclement.

[Jomini of the West map ](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTezG4QXoAAVLG-?format=jpg&amp;name=large)

Check out how many UA military units are endangered from being encircled. Not to mention untold numbers of noncombatants who didn't have the sense to leave already. They now have a single road to escape on that is being overwatched by drones and interdicted by artillery and airstrikes, all while the Russians on the perimeter are keeping the pressure up to compress the angle, so every part of that line has to leave units to conduct rear guards or else another breakthrough occurs. To stop that the UA need to counterattack hard to retake the areas the Russians just took while also doing their best to order a retreat out of that pocket without it turning into a rout.

Things aren't going well in the salient. No, it's not as bad as it could be if the Izyum assault had worked but it's reaching a point now that a general retreat from everything east of the M03 road is probably necessary unless the Ukrainians can pull a miracle out their asses in the form of a series of big ass successful counterattacks. 

Check out Jomini of the West's Twitter briefings and they're fucking terrific. Dead on accurate, great maps, includes units, and includes the negative not just the positive, all while still entirely pro Ukraine. 

But ISW tells the pro Ukraine people what they want to read but not what they need to be reading, which should be an accurate assessment of the situation. There is no reason that tactical setbacks have to be spun so positive that actual crisis turn into wins. 

I have no problem with them concluding that even if the entire Severodonetsk Salient had been cut from the get go it wouldn't mean much for the long run, that's a truthful assessment and also keeps the negativity in check. But when they have an entire subsection about that campaign itself and won't mention the danger of Ukraine GLOC already cut without them already having to mention numerous times in every update how the Ukrainians are threatening the Russian GLOC still very far away I'm left wondering who is editing that garbage and not ordering a rewrite. 

Imagine listening to a football game on the radio and the announcer covers up that one team scored. ""And the Giants make an especially hard tackle of the Pittsburgh quarterback in the end zone. Wow, what a hit, I'll bet he thinks twice next time to run the ball in. Now to a commercial break."" And you're sitting there scratching your head wondering, ""Wait, did that mean the Steelers just scored?"" If you have to think hard to find out what's happening that would be a shitty way to follow a football game, right?

It's best if the individual making the threat is credible in terms of carrying out, but a whole lot of threats in geopolitics are just like threats made in life, bullshit.

I didn't say that threats *cannot* be made without a guarantee of commitment. They can be made, sometimes they work and sometimes they fail, and when they fail they make things worse. The Syrian chemical weapons red line was a good example of the latter.

The old school way required what was essentially a large steel mill to cast, form, polish, etc the shells, with a shitload of low paid workers, no OSHA requirements or worrying about EPA regulations. Relying on large numbers of workers doesn't work when they get paid so well the companies make no money. Acting like the EPA will allow old school factories is laughable, or that they'll wave OSHA either isn't going to happen. This is all why so much of production has been outsourced to China and other countries, their workers are cheap and they don't care about the environment or safety. It's too expensive in every way to rely on large numbers of workers to make things.

It's all automated now, the humans involved are all highly skilled technicians who have to be trained expertly, the machines take quite some time to build, etc. Lots of money, lots of time. But there is no money, and nobody wants to wait. 

General Dynamic makes most of the shells, they can expand production right now to go to max capacity, three shifts a day, but Congress has to give the money first. I don't know how many rounds that gets or how long, but it won't be enough because the current system isn't set up to deal with long term artillery centric wars. 

So that means expansion. But if the US govt wants to have GD expand (or get anyone else) it's more than just funding to buy a set number of shells made by a set time that they can already make, it has to be for an amount so large it gives them the long term contractually obligated funding to expand, build new factories, hire an entire plant's worth of skilled employees at every level from directors to janitorial staff, have the machines ordered from the companies that make them (which will probably take years to build), etc. They need monetary assurances they won't be hung out to dry. Their executives aren't idiots, they're going to demand long term contracts because they're not investing in expansion without a firm commitment of long term purchases. IE, if for whatever reason this war ends in December they're not fucked for spending money to expand, the US govt is still buying 20 years worth of shells from them. 

For those curious, this is why US shale oil wont expand despite domestic oil prices, they know all the money they spent expanded ends up with production capabilities shut down as soon as the oil crisis ends because a large percentage of the govt, especially those holding power, hates domestic oil due to environmental ideology and wants the industry to die.

Same thing with anyone involved in defense. Nobody in that industry takes a shit without a contract in hand. They're not doing anything voluntarily, money talks, Congress is going to have to pony up big time.

And even if the govt enacts the Defense Production Act to pressure them they're still going to have to pay for everything and deal with the long delays too. But that money still hasn't been decided on yet.

And let's not even get into supply chain issues, like chip shortage needed for all the new machines. Or labor issues. And everything else.

The WW2 Arsenal of Democracy didn't start after Pearl Harbor, it was initiative planned out in the mid 1920s by the US Army, wholly planned out in the mid 30s, ramped up slowly since 37 to the point it was rather large by 1940 and then expanded more when the war started. By the time our boys were fighting, the best part of a decade had passed since we started converting the economy for war, and that was done using much simpler production methods with a hell of a lot more production resources, plus little to no regulatory red tape. 

But that was then and this is now, we've done no planning and expansion just isn't in the cards unless we're talking a very long term investment.",ea197caf8871b5fe55fd9d6cd74d7188322be799,True,False,,,,,0,1653445235,,0,{},i9vwutt,False,t3_uwp5x4,False,True,t1_i9vom7b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwp5x4/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_24_2022/i9vwutt/,1653445247,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653416435.0

The first purpose of the intelligence service is to prevent anyone from plotting a coup, and the first purpose of the army is to shoot the intelligence service in the event the intelligence service plans its own coup.

Actual warfighting is a distant second.

&gt; * During the height of the war in Vietnam, in the mid- 1960s, a graduate student at Stanford began to systemati- cally study the details of the war, down to the level of troop numbers on all sides, number of bombing sorties, casualties, troop attrition, kill ratios (then a big indicator in McNamara’s Defense Department), and political sup- port in the United States and South Vietnam for the in- cumbent administration and the war itself, along with the number of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese defectors. Statistical models of the relationships among these vari- ables were constructed and validated toward the goal of generating predictions (from computer simulations) about the escalation of the war. Jeffrey S. Milstein published his efforts in Dynamics of the Vietnam War: A Quantitative Analysis and Predictive Computer Simulation in 1974, and his working papers on this topic were widely read in the academic and policy communities. This was one of the first uses of prediction in the study of international relations (IR) and security studies. By 1974, articles were starting to promote forecasting in the realm of world politics (Choucri 1974), and a few years later, there was a volume devoted to the topic (Choucri and Robinson 1978). 

&gt; * It turns out that most of the examples of what we cannot predict have been overturned by scientific in- quiry, accompanied by clever and concerted research programs. 

&gt; * In his most recent article in Security Studies, Daniel Altman (2015) proposes “a new theory of false opti- mism as a cause of war.” Along with formal models, Altman points to Pearl Harbor as illustrative evidence that Japan’s decision-making in 1941 was “an instance of false optimism that lead to war, in this case war against a country with nearly ten times its military po- tential.” 

&gt; * A terrific example of this can be found in Liff and Ikenberry (2014), who focus on the theory of “security dilemmas” as a guide to understand- ing military competition in the Asian Pacific. 

&gt; * Liff and Ikenberry suggest that “on both sides” states prefer to avoid consumption of security-producing goods (militaries, wars, treaties) if they can secure credible commitments without them. 

&gt; * …we need more predictions. We need these predictions for four reasons. First, we need these predic- tions to help us make relevant statements about the world around us. We also need these predictions to help us throw out the bad “theories” that continue to flour- ish. These predictions will help drive our research into new areas, away from moribund approaches that have been followed for many decades. Finally, and perhaps most important, predictions will force us to keep on track. 

&gt; * In the 1980s, Philip Tetlock was concerned—like many—about the possibility of a nuclear conflict be- tween the United States and Soviet Union. Indeed, this was the main focus of most security studies during the Cold War. Popular movies and scholarly journals high- lighted what time it was on the so-called “doomsday” clock. Tetlock wanted to understand why the pundits made statements about the future that were all over the place. Frustrated by the fact that pundits justified their inaccuracies with revisions of history, timing, and other excuses, he collected forecasts—an amazing number of them (􏰁25,000)—and started to keep track and grade their accuracy. 

&gt; * Indeed, the most well qualified of experts often turned out to be the worst forecasters. 

&gt; * Another IARPA project is also interesting to exam- ine. It is known as the OSI, Open Source Indicators, project, in which the basic idea is that classified informa- tion is possibly inferior to open-source materials for making important predictions. Thus, an attempt has been made to undertake detailed, precise forecasts of the type often engaged in within the intelligence community, while only using materials found in the unclassified world. The goal is to develop and test methods for the automated analysis of publicly available data to antici- pate or detect significant social events. 
&gt; * The bottom line with theory is that for the most part, it looks back at the world and describes how things oc- curred. Often, it attempts to develop a teleology of why things occurred. Rarely is there a track record kept of whether the theory was borne out in cases not initially considered and where there is some ex ante evaluation, the theoretical response is often to add greater nuance to encompass the situations or cases that were not well cov- ered. Theory building does not generally lead to new ideas. 

&gt; * By develop- ing explanations and subjecting them to critical evalua- tions, we learned more. We can learn more again. We can build Antikythera Mechanisms. Though they may or may not tell us about the next sociopolitical eclipse in the international security system, they are likely to help us get rid of bad ideas.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces have likely abandoned efforts to encircle large Ukrainian formations in eastern Ukraine and are instead attempting to secure smaller encirclements and focus on Severodonetsk.

This change in the Russian approach is enabling gradual advances—but at the cost of abandoning several intended lines of advance and abandoning the Kremlin’s intended deep encirclement of Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces are likely conducting a controlled withdrawal southwest of Popasna near Bakhmut to protect Ukrainian supply lines against Russian offensives in the southeast of Bakhmut.

Russian occupation authorities in Mariupol announced that they will hold war crimes trials against Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol in a likely effort to strengthen judicial control of the city and support false Kremlin narratives of Ukrainian crimes.

Russian forces are attempting to retake Ternova in northern Kharkiv Oblast and seek to stabilize defensive positions near the Russian border against the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Russian forces are forming reserves and deploying S-400 missile systems in northwest Crimea to reinforce the southern axis.

Several DNR servicemen openly released a video appeal to DNR leader Denis Pushilin stating they have been forced into combat operations without proper support, indicating increasing demoralization among Russian and proxy forces.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. 

Russian forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to Northern Kharkiv in the near future. 

The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.

Russian forces in Mariupol will likely shift their focus to occupational control of the city as the siege of Azovstal has concluded.

Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in Southern Ukraine.",c89139ea2ba9b1706c09b80d7d42a0477d5b1e67,True,False,,,,,0,1653437770,,0,{},i9vh3nk,False,t3_uwp5x4,False,True,t3_uwp5x4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwp5x4/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_24_2022/i9vh3nk/,1653437785,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653408970.0
