The Russian judge who sent Alexei Navalny to prison died in suspicious circumstances shortly after saying she regretted jailing him, the opposition figure has claimed.  
  
Mr Navalny, who was nearly killed by Novichok poisoning in 2020, made the allegation during an appeal hearing on Tueday just moments before the Moscow court ordered him to be sent to a high-security prison for nine years.  
  
During the rare public appearance, Mr Navalny said Judge Natalya Repnikova – who jailed him in February 2021 - had since passed on a message through her friends that she was “sorry about her decision and her part in it and that she thought I was a brave man.”  
  
“Shortly after that she died of Covid,” Mr Navalny said, according to the Russian media outlet MediaZona.  
  
“I don’t want to speculate but she didn’t strike me as someone in a high-risk group. So if any judges want to pass on a word to me - and they will - please be careful so that you don’t end up seeing forensic experts at your doorstep.”  
  
The 45-year-old politician on Tuesday took the opportunity to condemn the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.  
  
“I’m certainly ready to stay in jail so that I can keep telling everyone about people dying in Ukraine,” he told the court.  
  
“You can destroy many lives but you will be defeated here and in this stupid war that you are waging.”  
  
Mr Navalny is Russia’s most popular opposition figure and spearheaded anti-Putin Kremlin protests for a decade before falling suddenly ill on a plane to Siberia in summer 2020. He spent more than two weeks in a medically induced coma in Germany before recovering.  
  
He was later proven to have been poisoned with the military-grade Soviet-era Novichok agent. He was jailed and sentenced to two and a half years in prison last February. This March he was given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court.  
  
Before he was jailed, Mr Navalny published a damning investigation that shed light on a Kremlin-orchestrated operation to kill him. One of his would-be assassins was heard in a phone conversation admitting to smearing the nerve agent on his underwear.  
  
Mr Navalny is now likely to be more isolated than ever. While he was serving his previous term at a prison colony a short train ride away from Moscow, his lawyers had been able to visit him regularly and pass on messages or take dictation from him to post on social media.",c5565a3be9345150b4ccb00540dd6ec46453b7f7,True,False,,,,,0,1653522051,,0,{},ia01y5i,False,t3_uxng2c,False,True,t3_uxng2c,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uxng2c/alexei_navalny_judge_said_sorry_for_jailing_me/ia01y5i/,1653522064,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653493251.0,

Russia is completely dependent on other countries for many things, especially electronics, exotic materials and telecommunications. For example, Russian imports of telecom gear fell from February to March by 98%. 

As a result, every piece of military equipment is irreplaceable. Each tank exploded and jet downed and radar array burned is permanently gone - no means of making a new one. Thus Putin cannot win a war of attrition. This is the primary goal. 

Secondly, Russia's GDP per capita fell from $16k to $9k in response to the sanctions after invading Crimea. Buying power of the average Russian was almost halved, and those were weak sanctions. It was a lower-middle income county to begin with, and this cut put them on par with Maldives at around #53 in the world. The recent sanctions are far more stringent. Data on the impact on GDP isn't available yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it halved again. The impact on the average Russian isn't the primary intention of the sanctions, and Russians are known for suffering silently (like we saw after the first sanctions) so probably isn't as big deal in the short term.

They have already almost achieved their military objectives.

The UA in the East is being systematically ground down and will collapse suddenly.

When that happens, Russia will be free to roll along the south of the country and capture Odessa which seals Ukraine off from the sea and cuts off their main source of revenue - grain exports.

The Poles are moving into Western Ukraine and that will leave the country as a rump state with Kiev and a little bit of land around it. 

Zelensky has led the country to complete disaster. 

The Western attempt to use sanctions has completely failed.

EU unity has completely failed and countries will now pay for oil and gas with Rubles - as Putin wanted.

NATO is now split with Turkey refusing to vote for Sweden and Finland to join. 

Finland and Sweden' policy has now failed as they have antagonised Russia and are left out of NATO.

The attempt to funnel money and weapons to the UA has failed.

The strategic goal to keep Russia and China apart has failed. Even the Gulf states and India have formed a loose alliance with them which threatens the petrodollar - the entire basis of American power.

&gt; Russia is abandoning its dead in Ukraine, as evidence grows of soldiers being hastily buried in shallow graves and stashed down wells.

&gt; Advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Vadym Denysenko, has told how Russian families are also living in fear of collecting the bodies of dead loved ones.

&gt; There were over 130 bodies and counting stacked inside just two carriages as part of Ukrainian efforts to respectfully identify the Russian dead. &amp;quot;Army Inform, the information agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, said:&amp;quot;We receive information about such burials and simply abandoned bodies in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region primarily from our military.

Which translates to "" the sanctions havent really done squat to the average russian"". Lego store was open, a bunch of name brand german stores were open, and they have these shops that arent a western shop, but sell the name brand western items, and they were still open.

So they are pretty insulated against most of these sanctions due to license and distribution agreements that western companies cannot pull out of.

Whatever leaves, russia will just make theri own version or source somewhere else. The only danger of sanctions hurting are if  you suddenly need a part for a western item that is no longer allowed to be sold there, and thats a very small percentage.

The call is coming from inside the house and you're in too deep with conservative propaganda to realize it

Thankfully Russia (and the GOP's biggest foreign ally) made the colossally stupid mistake of invading Ukraine thinking the world wouldn't care yet again, and now the US is able to freely wage a proxy war on one if its greatest foes and bleed the country's military dry.

Meanwhile you keep peddling lies, ignorance, and defending Russia. It's pathetic. I'm glad your kind is losing handidly all over.

What exactly, can you point?

&gt;We have a saying over here, you can lead a horse to water, but ya can't make them drink.

Do you mean I didn't lead you to russian sources? Will you watch them? Which question in particular you want to know about?

&gt;Did Ukraine send tanks and men across russias border to take their territory and lives?

Before 24.02 - yes they did, several saboteur groups in Crimea. 

They've also had a big military conflict with republics of Doneck and Lugansk since 2014 to our days. That allowed to use article 51 for collective safety. Kiev wasn't peaceful at all last 8 years.

&gt;Now I want you to answer the same question about whether Russia has sent tanks and men across Ukraines border to take their territory and lives?

""Take their territory and lives"" - nope, not really. Initially change of governmental course was enough, but since this option is blocked by NATO backed dictatorship it turns to big war. 

&gt;It's really as simple as that. 

Did Cuba sent men and tanks in USA to take their territory and lives? 

What was the Bay of Pigs invasion and Cuban missile crysis about then?

If it's ""really simple as that""?

&amp;#x200B;

May I ask one more question than also - did NATO countries send tanks and men across LDNR borders to take their territory and lives?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; However, it's clear who the aggressor is

Who? Don't be scared - say it out loud.

&gt; That's how the world sees it too. 

Even despite massive propaganda and russian initiative most of the world knows that it was provoked by USA/NATO proxy Ukraine. Billions of people. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Seriously, all Russian state TV talks about

How often do you watch russian tv? What programmes have you watched this week?

&gt;Haven't seen any nuclear threats lobbed at Russia lately

Just a test of hypersonic missiles, NATO trainings and suggestion to move weapons which can be used with nuclear warheads to eastern europe. Not threats at all. One day an accident happens and we'll all disappear. And guilty for that will be on your braindead hawks.

&gt;I still retain my sense of right and wrong. You don't.

That's interesting, because I've explained myself. And you feel self-entitled to strip me off right to have morals equal to US citizen :)

justification for genocide

You've repeated this stupid accusation like 10 times already - [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/genocide-accusation-russia-biden-willing-get-ahead-government-rcna24601](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/genocide-accusation-russia-biden-willing-get-ahead-government-rcna24601)

Do you know there are \~10 mln ukranians in Russia? How do you imagine ""genocide""? You are completely off topic if you make such claims.

&gt;mass murder

""Why didn't we announce evacuation before, when we knew Russia will attack? Because there would be too many refugees"" - [https://youtu.be/Y43v80kRmNg](https://youtu.be/Y43v80kRmNg)

Now it's less, thanks to ""living shield"" tactics and city fights.

&gt;Ukraine did not warrant this. Similar to Iraq.

Ahah, nice comparison Iraq half-globe away from US, destroyed by imaginary reason of powder in a glass and 3d model. And Ukraine with literal neonazi squads in army, pro-nazi state policy, nuclear threat, military threat with NATO, doing a war and threatening invasion in Crimea. Yeah, great comparison, shows really well, who of us is searching for excuses and makes up things.

&gt;You especially lack the ability to be unbiased

Of course, how many you've considered russian point of view?

Zero. Not ""especially lacking being unbiased"", just too exceptional for simple humans.

&gt;You believe everything your side says and does.

Oh, yeah, I'm just stupid and did no research, what party tells me - I repeat. Except that I've grown with this conflict and lived in both countries, saw hundreds of hours of different materials, especially after 2014.

And you? Spent several evening in r-ukraine and r-worldnews, knows the truth. Admit it - you know nothing, you don't know anyone in ukranian politics, you don't know stories, you have no idea what happened in different regions in society, what was shown on TV, who are ukranian oligarchs and what groups are they split into, where were people like Bileckiy or Yarosh before, history of nationalism, OUN and UNSO. Nothing.

Your best thought so far is ""was is bad"", but what about war against such guys - [https://youtu.be/eGg07FpmcKc?t=24](https://youtu.be/eGg07FpmcKc?t=24)

They were trained by your countrymen on your taxes, trained on how to act like terrorist. Now your state will be associated with that till its end, just as with Operation Cyclone.

&gt;You couldn't admit wrong if you wanted to. I can.

Can you?

I haven't seen a single word how ukranian killed their own, used them as living shield, killed POW, tortured people, killed strangers for having beard for example and so on.

Not a single word - why do you lie about yourself then?

&gt;Poor Russia had no choice but to invade Ukraine

Looks like you know situation better and can give better alternative - do it please.

&gt;If only that would have worked, this would be over by now.

Says a man from a country which failed and ran from afghanistan after 20 years...

Kiev in 3 days, right? With 20k troops? That's what you couch experts suggested?:)

&gt;Picture is worth 1000 words

Except you get distorted picture AND only from one side.

Info war reality.

&gt;Ukraine is burning, not Russia.

They have food-water-electricity-russian gas (!)- phone-internet 90 days into war. I wouldn't call that special operation as ""burning ukraine"". Don't embarass yourself with absurd claims.

&gt;The Ukrainians don't want to fight

That's why their official military doctrine suggests to take over Crimea and LDNR?:)

That's why they have nation-wide ""war tax""? Have military education in 10-11 grade in school? Trained at least 23k soldiers together with NATO? Dragged insane amount of weapons, especially to Donbass area? Kept shooting LDNR civilians for YEARS, literally? Refused Minsk-2 peace treaty? Diplomatically announced return of nuclear weapons? Print maps [like this](https://i.imgur.com/7lasm10.jpg) (made in Kherson Special service cabinet)? Making antirussian laws? Doing torch parades chanting ""hang russians"" and ""destroy moscow'?

Yeah... what a peaceful country... Why even their main ""defenders"" have swastika on logo, I wonder...

&gt;You call it a civil war

Even Doneck-Lugansk citizens aren't ukranians? :)))

&gt;It was an invasion under false pretense with little green men, just like Georgia.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-russia-report-idUSTRE58T4MO20090930](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-russia-report-idUSTRE58T4MO20090930)

americans... Like Georgia, yes, that's partly true. You pushed them both to these wars, but if Saakashvili managed to only eat his tie, Zelenskiy and co will be hanged on theirs.

&gt;is because the world at large cannot allow your war of aggression to continue into Europe

Ahahaha, USA doesn't need strong Europe, that's why you've organized this war. To cut the ties between strong union with strong industry and resources. All limitrophe belt are USA cocksuckers with Soros-NED shills. Stop being ignorant, wake up.

&gt;This is building to WWIII and you're fucking crazy

USA is provoking WWIII. Your government literally says ""we are at war with Russia"". What the fuck? Did you declare war on us? Do you suggest Russia to came on this war?

YOUR government is doing this. Playing with fire half-globe away. Don't know about you, but I don't have trust in your hawks and demented pedos, and checked where bunker is located.

&gt;You have no moral highground

We definitely do. And room for maneuvers, thanks to reckless USA foreign policies.

&gt;The cold war, took two parties

Untrue, you've continued your policies - take NATO expansions for example. Don't tell me Slovenia and Czechia were in danger.

&gt;the US did not cause Ukraine

Partly it was Ukranian oligarchy decision, but who were their partners? USA and satellites.

USA is behind both coups 2004 and 2014, in which balancing leader was changed to pro-western. And you say ""we didn't cause""? Don't lie. You've participated in enormous amount of events to push Ukraine on antirussian path.

&gt;they clearly don't see you as liberators

Yeah - let's look how they ignore banned in Ukraine holiday - [https://youtu.be/WL\_9i2sM-cI](https://youtu.be/WL_9i2sM-cI)

Oh, these victims of genocide and opression... They hate russia so much, that whole city came to celebrate main russian holiday.

Watch less ukranian bullshit please, or at least mix it with something russian, before making an opinion.

&gt;Mass Graves. Executions. Torture. Rape of children.

Iraq?

&gt;They don't want you there

They (ukranian under Kievan regime) also didn't want LDNR war and what? They've voted 73% for a candidate who promised to do anything to stop it - he lied and refused. So, how do your words matter?

&gt;but YOU DID THIS

Not really, it's Ukranian army decision to stay in cities and provoke destruction. They deliberately prepared for city fights, made defense lines inside living areas, didn't evacuate and so on...

Plus huge part of destruction is done by them,especially in LDNR.

But you don't get this shown in your news - go watch something different ( like this channel for example - [https://youtu.be/npQiQx3OmQA?t=128](https://youtu.be/npQiQx3OmQA?t=128) )

&gt;US withdrew from ICC for a reason

There is one more reason why all war criminals don't get punished in USA. Self-entitled butchers. Too stinky to teach someone how to live.

&gt;and innocent people are dying

What's the problem to stop it? Biden says to Zelenskiy - okay, we done, ban nazis, you aren't nato, LDNR people have rights. And that's all.

Instead 40 bln $ to ""make russia bleed"" by the cost of whole Ukraine. Maybe more if conflict goes out of control.

Oh, and send ""volunteers"" there. [Amazing people](https://i.starhit-cdn.ru/steady/62/89/62/original/628962915037706b9a5d1057/1024x631.jpg).
