I sense that the author represents India's desire to avoid the world becoming polarized and even some denial in this occurring.  As much as the West could be incorrectly assuming the world will be dividing so clearly, India runs the risk of not coming to grips with the current events.

There are signs that power balance could be fundamentally shifting even in Asia.  In Taiwan, now there is political discussion on re-instating conscription.  In S Korea, the newly elected president is likely to take a much more aggressive posture against N Korea in light of Ukraine conflict.  They are developing medium range ballistic missiles that could be used in pre-emptive strike, and there is discussion about hosting US nuclear arms and possibly nuclear sharing like NATO.  These developments are very likely to lead to counter-reaction from N Korea, Russia, and China, further eliminating room for neutrality.

The Arab world as a whole sees the treatment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a big hypocrisy. While majority of the Arab countries and their public opinions would not support the Russian invasion for obvious reasons, but one being that they are anti foreign intervention and pro sovereignty, the same public opinion can't but feel flabbergasted by what is happening internationally.

A lot of people in the Arab world see that drastic and unprecedented economic sanctions have been taken against Russia in less than 15 days, and even other sanctions that goes even to the sport world (Russia not being in the world cup anymore or even in the Fifa video game). 

Arab people feel that they are treated as subhuman compared to the Ukrainians, because USA invaded Irak in 2003 of false claims and had many many war crimes like the torture and rape in Abu Ghraib prison, bombed it with depleted uranium and, many cases of civilians bombing and killing (with that video of a sniper that kills two children coldly that went viral in the Arab world) and hundreds of thousands of dead overall. And no sanction ever was imposed on america. On the contrary they were helped by international contingents and armies and did whatever they wanted until they got fed up. Add to that the 70 years struggle for a Palestinian states with all the horrors that go with it and the systematic American help to Israel whatever their avtions.And the sentiment in the Arab world is that they are considered are inferior that other forms of human lives.

I think this sentiment is not to be underestimated because it's shared everywhere in the Arab world from Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians, Algerians, Tunisians, Irakis etc. from the discussions I had with friends and close ones. 

I think it will leave a dent in the future relationhip the west has with the Arab world, because the public opinion is very strong on that and can't be ignored.

Most countries who are not critically dependent on the US financially or militarily have not supported the US. Even [Israel - which **is** critically dependent on the US, has been resisting imposing sanctions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-hasnt-joined-anti-russia-sanctions-but-its-firms-need-to-tread-carefully/], probably because of long standing ties of its population to Russia.

Of the countries supporting the US, some are pointing out US hypocrisy (for example Mexico made a reference on how their land had been illegally annexed by the US in one of the votes)


-------------------------------

**Democracy**

This week, the duly elected Prime Minister of Pakistan accused the US of trying to topple his government and specifically named a US official - Donald Lu of coordination the efforts so. 

Some might dismiss this as a conspiracy pushed by Pakistan. the fact remains that the US has a unmatched record of toppling governments and violating sovereign integrity of foreign nations, both by clandestine means and overt invasion since the end of WW2 to the extent that the ""US bringing democracy"" has become a punchline to a joke.

A US appeal to such principles must be seen for what it is - an opportunity for the US to push forth its interests and to restrict the rise of a past and possible future near power power.

-------------------------------

Unlike seemingly, the US voters, world is well aware that many of the principles that the US has used in the past to topple governments and to invade countries both afar and in its vicinity are the same as what Russia is using today.

- After all the US justified wars - such as Iraq and Afghanistan - on the principle  of pre-emptive self defense. The extent threats posed by the Iraq - even if it turned out that they actually had some WMD - is a fraction of the threat a hostile Ukraine poses to Russia.

- The US also has toppled several governments, and has invaded Panama and Grenada, in its general vicinity. Ukraine OTOH is right at the border of Russia

- The US bombed Libya, due to actions of Libya against a few Americans. Ukraine has killed far more civilians

- The US bombed Yugoslavia to create remove Kosovo from it.  Donbass has far weaker links to Ukraine than Kosovo had to Yugoslavia. 

- The US was willing to wage a nuclear war over missiles in Cuba. Russia has not come close to this yet.

-------------------------------- 

Nations recognize that countries act to safeguard their interests and security, and that principles must be balanced with a recognition of a country's vital interests, particularly if the country has significant power to achieve those vital interests by force. 

--------------------------------

Support for sanctions globally is about influence and interests. The actions of the world so far have shown that the US has lost a lot of influence, and is in the danger of losing more if it pushes further.",d2a16dbca3076109f7e20db6539b7954a43deab8,True,False,,,,,0,1649094193,,0,{},i3dncfn,False,t3_tw3wt7,False,True,t3_tw3wt7,/r/geopolitics/comments/tw3wt7/the_fantasy_of_the_free_world_are_democracies/i3dncfn/,1649094211,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649065393.0,

&gt; wasn't just to appease to Quebec,

Yes... yes it was. The Clarity Act of 1999 set motion for the rules you're discussing *as a direct consequence of the '95 referendum*. A province's ability to secede from Canada is predicated on that act as it was previously ill-defined. So, yet it was exactly to appease Quebec. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The US has far more shared powers, whereas in Canada labour, certain business and criminal standards are the exclusive purview of the Federal government. On the other hand the US has more shared power.

Eh, no. The federal government has the exclusive right over coining money, international trade, the ability to declare war and over the mail. The federal court system is really only involved in cases involving inter-state crime, cases arising from acts of congress or when it pertains to the US constitution. None of that is the case in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Canada just had its own free trade agreement, the CFTA ratified in 2020. It doesn't have a securities commission. When the prime minister goes out and signs an international treaty, every province has the right to reject the treaty for themselves.

You're confusing things. Provinces can refuse certain portions *if* it impacts provincial jurisdiction and is specific to their province; however, that's not a sign of enhanced rights, but of poor design. No Canadian province should have the notwithstanding right to obviate the entire country of a FTA (as Belgium attempted to do with CETA). The US is right on the money there, Congress should have the exclusive right to negotiate trade deals. That does not mean, however, that the federal government has more/less power but a clearer delineation of power. A State has the right to raise an army, enforce its own constitution and has control over most services. On a state-level, only federal roads cross jurisdictional boundaries. That's the reason why Roe V. Wade is such a contentious issue. It's federal law that has crossed a jurisdictional boundary that for political reasons isn't being touched. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't know why you focused on your own specific markers but Canadian provinces have more rights if you look at it on a whole and secession is the biggest tell - which province can actually leave.

My point was clear: The US Senate is elected and apportioned; the Senate can knock-down legislation and the State is the driving factor. That's not the case in Canada, the Senate is appointed, rarely blocks legislation and has almost no authority. States have more mechanisms of remedy than a Canadian province; they have their own constitution and ability to enforce constitutional matters. Canada doesn't have that. And your example of a lack of a securities commission is just a great example of why Canada is the money laundering and financial crimes capital of the world. It's not an example of power delineation but a failing of the system. Given that the RCMP is entirely reliant on intel from the FBI, US Postal Service Police and Secret Service to track-down Canadians guilty of sex crimes, I'm not sure you want to use that as an example.",a1f12f0d6da01da55cdc09caf5dbb52c47774eba,True,False,,,,,0,1649086309,,0,{},i3d32xh,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i3cw8c0,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i3d32xh/,1649086327,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649057509.0,

I don't think India should be held to the same standards as western democracies. They have a billion people they need to feed, house and supply energy to. It's not as easy for them to diversify as it is for advanced economies in the West. 

More to the point; I am not sure if Ukraine will be the decoupling event a lot of people think it is. I think diplomacy will continue once some of the dust has settled and things will more or less get back to normal.

I think there will be three major things to take away from this conflict though. One is the complete overhaul of traditional warfare we have known for the past 70 years. It's more commercially viable to have drones hit supply lines with advanced intelligence than it is to have a large standing army. This will have massive repercussions for countries that developed their military based on numbers and not quality. The second big take-away is the willingness for Russia to use it's resources as an economic tool for sustaining it's war efforts and the West's willingness to exclude Russia from any financial instruments that are traditionally seen as a way of preventing war because of mutual economic interests. The final take-away is going to be the rush to renewable energy. If gas and oil are not reliable then there will need to be a shift to alternatives.

Argentina is most definitely a western nation, as all of the americas would be defined, due to language, religion, history, democratic traditions even if flawed.

Argentina has close ties to Italy due to many argentines having dual citizenship. However Argentina has a heavy peronist character to it, which has put it at odds with the US, UK, and other leaders of western factions. Peronism is sort of a rejection of both capitalism and socialism/communism yet incorporating elements of both. It has a bit of autarky to it, see the smartphone blunder in patagonia as an example, and its fiercely independent/nationalist, with the Falkland Islands as a rallying cry against a boogeyman UK. 

It's not just peronism that drives a wedge between Argentina and other western states, but also the fact that they cant run a gov without going into extreme debt. The left-wing peronists have run up huge debts and the gov has defaulted several times in its history. They like to blame the IMF/US for these blunders, instead of blaming themselves.

""Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provoked outrage and unleashed a barrage of economic sanctions from many Western governments. Some, such as Germany, have boosted their military spending after years of riding on American coattails. In these actions, certain analysts have found a silver lining to the devastation of the war in Ukraine. Writing in *Foreign Affairs* in March, Michael Beckley and Hal Brands argued that the international reaction to the invasion would reverberate well beyond the current crisis. The concerted response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions could “consolidate a global alliance that unites democracies against Russia and China and thereby secures the free world for a generation to come.” In this view, Russia’s war in Ukraine might be a pivotal episode in a global contest between autocracy and democracy. Chastened by Putin’s gross violation of norms, democracies will band together in a muscular reaffirmation of the liberal international order.  
That is wishful thinking. The war is no doubt a seismic event that will have profound consequences for Russia, its immediate neighbors, and the rest of Europe. But it will neither reshape the global order nor presage an ideological showdown of democracies against China and Russia. After all, many of the world’s biggest democracies, including India, have so far not joined the U.S.-led economic campaign against Russia or even explicitly condemned the invasion. Far from consolidating “the free world,” the war has underscored its fundamental incoherence. In any case, the future of global order will be decided not by wars in Europe but by the contest in Asia, on which events in Ukraine have limited bearing.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As I said, the two are not necessarily in conflict insofar as one can ""hope for the best but plan for the worst,"" but you seemed to disagree with that, so I don't know what you were arguing.

Sorry I guess I wasn't clear.  I think the Chamberlain government pursued Appeasement on the goal of preventing war in the very short term but I don't think it was a part of a long term strategy to secure peace within Europe.  Britain at the time was planning for the worst, only in so far that they were directly responding to the security environment of rearmament in Europe, and they had been doing so since before the Nazis, because post-WWI demobilizations left them dangerously un-militarized.  It wasn't as if the heads of state has the crystal ball to know the war was a year away in 1939, they weren't thinking ""Oh if we can push the start of this inevitable war to 1942 we can counter the Germans"". 

At all times the British army was under gunned to fight a war on the continent and desperately relied on what remained of the Royal Navy to protect the Isles.  The opening to the war showed this.  Equally, the German army was quite adept at making their force more effective then their manpower and equipment would have seemed.

Appeasement was a recognition that Britain did not want to be pulled into a conflict on the continent if it didn't have to.  They had no security guarantees with the Czechs, but the French did and Britain didn't want to have to intervene to keep the status quo.  So they gave up the Sudetenland.  It wasn't a grand bargain or a future proofed strategy, just an acceptance of the reality on the ground.  The scenario was hazy enough that they could accept the pretense that no red lines were crossed.  The invasion of Poland on the other had crossed that line.

If the British and French wanted to delay till they had more strength they would have allowed Poland to fall completely without repercussion again.

The point to make about appeasement in this context is that Britain had the power to fight Germany both in 1938 and 1939, but it didn't really have the power to win.  With 2020 hindsight, the Germans might have been less prepared to blitz France a year earlier, but that's not a fair analysis to put on them.  So Appeasement, that is the acceptance of demands in the face of force, is not effective if the goal is to avoid war, if war is inevitable, and appeasement itself seems to have no impact on it's prevention.  But if you don't think you can fight that war, it's effective at keeping you out of it, in so far as you are choosing not to defend against those demands, basically admitting you don't have the geopolitical power to contest the issue.  It's not a play for peace, it's an acceptance the other player has made the first move and you'd rather concede than fight.

People are disillusioned with appeasement because it's sold as a peace bargain, when it is metaphorically, a retreat.  **This is why I agree with you about the prevailing view of Chamberlain and appeasement.**  I think the reality is quite complex and it was a very difficult situation, but I also don't think it was particularly effective, it the goal was to be more prepared for war.

Appeasement in our modern context would most accurately be NATO agreeing with Russia to allow Russia to occupy the Baltics to avoid a conflict they don't think they can win. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which really raises the question to begin with: why did we ever talk about NATO membership for a country that we were not willing to defend?

It's a complex history of diplomatic missteps, imo.  NATO 1989 - 2014 wasn't a force aimed at Russia, in fact it was infamously directionless, and one of it's only major actions was to bomb Serbia (people like to erroneously say they bombed Kosovo for some reason?) even though no defense pact was violated.  In a lot of circles it was viewed as a part of web of alliances and pact that inducted a member nation into the richer more prosperous west, which was very desirable for post-soviet countries.

The way NATO acted threatened Russia, or perhaps more accurately, it threatened the image of a Russia with a strong sphere of influence in post-soviet states.  Putin who puts great stock in Russia former position as the peer competitor of the USA, view it's decline as horrendous, and NATO expansion is a direct threat, not to the sovereignty of Russia, but to all possible ambitions Russia might have to one again be a peer competitor.  There is no more influence to be had once all their neighbors are pro-US NATO countries.  Russia has a lot of the blame for letting this occur, it's past treatment of it's neighbors being key in creating something to exploit their weakness over, but they are also the ones acting to defend their ambitions.

This caught the US by surprise because it just didn't think the world worked this way anymore.  It was a sole hegemon fighting off the rise of China in the economic sphere and desperately making plans to contain them in Asia.  Eastern Europe was an after thought.  Since 2014 NATO has squarely become a force to oppose Russia, once again, and now with the invasion of Ukraine, Europe has agreed to up their commitments.  Pre-2014 invitations to Ukraine were about trying to get Ukraine into the European security and Economic framework, same with Georgia.  Post-2014 threats about getting Ukraine in the NATO were being used as a stick to get Putin to back off, which didn't work, and NATO wasn't going to commit while there was a territorial dispute that could trigger article 5.",c40d416f10f7c5eebb62fcc9895c16a3eb7e889a,True,False,,,,,0,1649079152,,0,{},i3cm8o4,False,t3_ts81mc,False,True,t1_i3ch1vn,/r/geopolitics/comments/ts81mc/the_perilous_long_game_in_ukraine_compromising/i3cm8o4/,1649079168,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649050352.0,

There are some points I find especially of interest given they seem to be common between people with ties to Russia.

First, I think most agree on the fact that Russia needs some kind of victory since the losses/expenses this war has resulted in for them do not allow for coming back home with nothing, therefore they need to bring a result to justify the continued expenses (both from a military and economic standpoint). However, this point means to me that you are actually not winning, meaning that you are effectively moving the goalposts and reducing your initial demands so you can argue you have ""won"", according to a more limited definition of winning compared to the original plans. 

See:

&gt;But I believe that we will avoid that, first, because Russia will win, whatever that victory means

But also:

&gt;We need victory. I don’t think that, even if we conquered all of Ukraine and all the military forces of Ukraine surrendered, it would be a victory, because then we will be left with the burden of a devastated country, one devastated by 30 years of inept elite rule, and then of course devastation from our military operation.

I cannot say I agree with him on these statements overall. ""Whatever that victory means"" seems to be that they need to arbitrarily define their victory according to some unknown objectives so that in any case they always win. The fact you can sell something as a win for propaganda purposes does not mean that you have achieved victory from a strategic or economic standpoint.

Finally, I often read sentences similar to this one (in the context of a NATO intervention and escalation of the conflict):

&gt;Put it this way: if the US intervenes against a nuclear country, then the American president making that decision is mad, because it wouldn’t be 1914 or 1939; this is something bigger.

Why should the opposite not be true? In that case, why would Russia ever further escalate the conflict with nuclear weapons considered that the US, UK and France have their own nuclear arsenals? I do not see why the US should fear Russia so much at this point in time if Russia does not fear the US.

More generally, Russia can escalate the conflict if it perceives their adversary (NATO in this case) is not willing to escalate further and will back down. Is this the point he is trying to convey without actually mentioning it?

I don't think that's a particularly compelling argument.

&gt;Chamberlain is mocked as being this gullible chump who was dumb enough to actually trust Hitler and think that you could get ""peace in our time"" if you just let him wet his beak a little.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But appeasement was almost entirely about delaying war, not preventing it. To the extent that it had anything to do with prevention, it was ""hope for the best but plan for the worst."" The proof is that at the same time Chamberlain was negotiating Munich, he massively increased British defense spending.

I disagree with this, both in how Chamberlain is interpreted, but also with the idea that it was simply a delaying action.  I don't think it was a bargain to avoid war, I think Britain, which was fundamentally not in a position to stop Hitler was desperately trying to find any leverage it could to prevent his swift expansion short of responding with open warfare.

Rearmament was in progress but had started before the Nazi's even took power, and they were struggling because they scale to which they had de-armed after the great war was immense.  They had no timetable for when they would be ready for war, nor did they expect war to happen.  The security context of Europe at the time was just one of arms escalation, one in which Britain was losing and it was looking for whatever levers it could pull to stop it.

I still don't think they were, in net, any better position in late 1939 then they were in late 1938, nor shoudl they have expected to have been.  I don't think Munich bought the allies anything in reality.  If anything, 20/20 hindsight shows the German war machine was less stable then it was in 1939, and in less of a position to respond to France and Britain.  Germany was hardly a juggernaut, and once it was done trying to knock down the easy dominoes using novel military tactics that resulting in huge surprising wins their war machine started to drag and larger more stable powers over whelmed them.

None the less, to return to the main point...

&gt;well, you should still try first. If we try first and it fails, fine, we can always do it your way second. But if we go straight to your way first, then we cannot do it my way second.

This depends on what Putin stands to gain from negotiations and what kind of position this put Europe in.  I think it's interesting to talk about now because the terms of negotiation seem to change as we talk as Putin seems to ask for less as time drags on.

I think for example, demanding Ukraine remain open to a future attack would be unacceptable for NATO to agree to (as in by removing sanctions) as it buys a temporary reprieve to allow Putin to try and re-adjust his strategy for another go.

Equally, because Putin appears to be in a weaker position, it seems unlikely NATO would 'just accept' the return status quo of the last 8 years, without at least some kind of concession.  It will really depends on how to next few days unfold.",1c6860fc5bee444d3dac9e0b165dfa4dececf64d,True,False,,,,,0,1649064568,,0,{},i3byzh8,False,t3_ts81mc,False,True,t1_i38jntq,/r/geopolitics/comments/ts81mc/the_perilous_long_game_in_ukraine_compromising/i3byzh8/,1649064584,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649035768.0,

As always, thank you for reading!",6fa6815c76e32802d688f1a78b82b33a32ff94f8,True,False,,,,,0,1649044997,,0,{},i3b8sa6,True,t3_tvs6ur,False,True,t3_tvs6ur,/r/geopolitics/comments/tvs6ur/piercing_the_fog_of_war_an_ongoing_effort/i3b8sa6/,1649045010,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649016197.0,

&gt;
&gt;But I do not think the failure of Minsk II was solely the responsibility of Ukraine - take, for example, Russia's ridiculous insistence that it was not a party to the agreement.
&gt;

Minsk II fiasco is squarely on Ukraine. Russia's claim that they were not a part was asinine, but Ukraine's outright refusal to honor the guidelines was what doomed the entire framework.

Imagine the Ukrainians adding NATO accession into the constitution. Utter madness. 

&gt;Also, I think Minsk II was doomed for several reasons, namely that Putin and his inner circle wanted a war and wanted to bring Ukraine back into the fold (i.e. Belarus II), and that the treaty did not solve the water supply to the Crimea which could eventually have provoked a war on its own.
&gt;

Putin didn't want a war. If he did. He would have invaded all in back in 2014. He wanted a Ukraine that was neutral since the idea of a puppet Ukraine was clearly out of the question after Yanukovich's retreat. 

They wanted a federal Ukraine that would come close to the EU, but would never take the critical steps of joining NATO. Such a Ukraine would be a massive boon for Russia's Economy, as the puppet eastern Ukraine would hand out identification documents to Russia's middle class enabling easier migration to Europe. 

This is a double win- exporting the more adventurous elements of the population while also securing money flow into Russia keeping those left behind even more docile. 

&gt;Also, I don't think the success of the Ukrainian military was a foregone conclusion.
&gt;

&gt;We'll have to see whether Kyiv is ruined before the war ends. But either way a massive amount of money will flow into Ukraine.

Russia's abandonment of the Kiev siege without even beginning artillery bombardment took me by surprise. I didn't think they would actually pack up and leave. 

Zelenskyy must be ready to make major concessions and so I expect that we will have a treat before long. 

Russia's shift to Donbass as well as the bombardment of energy infrastructure is also a good sign for peaceful relations resuming before long.

By creating a Ukraine that is less energy secure and with thousands of Russian troops in Donbass, all that is needed is an invasion of Odessa to create a more pliant Ukraine. 

Unfortunately, I think Russia will give in after razing the energy infrastructure and won't take Odessa. They'll focus on holding the south, calling it a reestablishment of Novorossiya and walk away like nothing happened. 

Zelenskyy stays, signs another security guarantee. Sanctions against Russia are not lifted, and when Putin dies his successor will reinvade when the Ukrainians make another bolt for the exit.

Worst of both worlds is my prediction.",f1a491a065a5ebc21d7fa406e2af6017882f3acf,True,False,,,,,0,1649043890,,0,{},i3b6pej,False,t3_tkqbs7,False,False,t1_i2j4d65,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkqbs7/why_did_russia_keep_its_foreign_reserves_abroad/i3b6pej/,1649043908,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649015090.0,
