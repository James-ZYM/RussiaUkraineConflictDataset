You will often find right-wing extremism in the military, grouped in specific units that became popular. This is not a unique thing to Ukraine.   


Is it good? Nope. It's a necessary evil for a country that has been at war since 2014 by a much more powerful ally and basically not having any significant military to resist. AZOV battalion and it's dubious soldiers did a job that nobody else did. Just like criminals have been sent to fight at the front for centuries, to clean their sheets and either die trying or defend their country.   


War is complicated. Ironically there are a lot of Nazi/fascist groups fighting on the DNR / Russian side against Azov, most notably Serbian volunteers, people from the Wagner group and various 'outlawed' Russian fascist groups (numbering in the 100,000 somewhere in 2010).   


It's very convenient to point at Azov, while we have evidence from for example a jewish journalist whom was embedded with them and noted ABSOLUTELY ZERO antisemitic behaviour or discussions. They treated him respectfully. What he did notice was a distinct amount of nationalism, even among the people who had dubious tattoos. They were ultra-nationalists much more than that they were anti-semitic or in other ways resembled Nazis.

T-90: 350 active, 200 in storage

If he were a sane man he'd be contemplating the sunk cost fallacy wondering how many more tanks he should lose before he thinks it's no longer okay to keep losing tanks.  He's acting like losing more tanks is going to bring back the tanks he already lost.

We can assume that a sizable portion of ""in storage"" means ""was scavenged for parts that we can't make or get any longer"".

So it's maybe 2,200 active tanks left in inventory with an unknown ability to activate the 'stored' equipment.

If you voiced opinions about supporting Putin in most environments I'd imagine you'd get a similar reaction to saying Hitler was just misunderstood, however, unlike in Russia where if you held a pro-Zelensky protest, in the west you wouldn't end up arrested, beaten and jailed indefinitely. At least you have the right to shout support for Putin if you so wish. That's what makes defeating Russia in Ukraine important.

As far as the process, that's an interesting question.

Western democracies need to wake the fuck up and stop pretending like this kind of massacre is a thing of the past, or a “developing country problem.”  Our complacency is disgusting.  All of this was preventable if we had been willing to stick our necks out and take risks for other people’s freedom before things got this far.

It’s about Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova he wants them all under his Greater Russia. So he’ll just carry on. Putin is a chancer and the siloviki will not want to commit nuclear suicide by ramping up to using WMD.

Putin has three options:

1.	⁠carry on slugging it out and losing abysmally;
2.	⁠Negotiate (properly - not the current games to buy time and go with a false narrative);
3.	⁠Ramp up to use of WMD.

Then argument that if NATO gets involved and Putin goes nuclear is not as clear cut as it seems. Putjn has to survive, otherwise he’ll never achieve his desired pace in history. If he goes nuclear he goes down as the idiot who lost a war agaisnt a smaller neighbour and the man who ruined Russia. If he goes for option one, he just loses more slowly. But if he’s faced with NATO, he will jump quickly to Option Two.

However, NATO is not coalesced in the sense that it’s bound to support Ukraine and ensure Ukrainian sovereignty is returned, completely. NATO’s coalesced to defend itself only.  Indeed, agreement of all member states is needed to go into Ukraine. So far NATO has stood on the sidelines and some countries, such as France and Germany, have paid more attention to their self interests than Ukraine and Putin.  These are the appeasers Putin needs. Putin found the weak spots for NATO and one of those was Macron, all too eager to raise his profile at a time of national elections.  I think Putin has played NATO very well, up to now. But the latest atrocities (Bucha) might change the mindset of some NATO Member States.  Putin may find himself facing a coalition of some of the NATO Member States, at least one being a nuclear state, willing to support Ukraine outside the NATO envelope.",81a3f0b686e90893b17a2893cd7836b71cf0ac8c,True,False,,,,,0,1649089159,,0,{},i3da9j7,False,t3_tvwe87,False,True,t3_tvwe87,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tvwe87/former_russias_richest_man_discusses/i3da9j7/,1649089170,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649060359.0,,,,

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia planned to take Kyiv in three days. The Russian army bought 45,000 body bags and brought mobile crematoria. I am sure that mass executions were planned in Ukraine,&amp;quot; wrote German political scientist Sergei Sumlenny on Twitter.

&gt; As the political scientist emphasizes, back in 2021, the Russian authorities adopted a document on preparations for the creation of mass graves right from the time of World War II. The document &amp;quot;State technical standard for excavations and maintenance of mass graves in war conditions&amp;quot; was adopted in September last year and entered into force on February 1, 2022.

&gt; &amp;quot;Finally, the political scientist notes that&amp;quot;On February 26, 4 days after the planned attack and 2 days after the real attack, the largest Russian state portal RIA Novosti published an article about the victory over Ukraine and the final solution of the Ukrainian issue.
