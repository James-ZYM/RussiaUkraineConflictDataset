They committed the bulk of their BTGs to Ukraine and a large number of them at this point are barely combat effective. How exactly are they going to reconstitute them all? 

They spent since 2009 building a professional enlisted core of contract troops in their combat arms units, and they are the ones getting hurt so bad. They built a legit long standing NCO corps, and those too are the ones getting hurt so bad. Their officer corps, which has no ""up or out"" promotion system, has a ""lead from the front"" mentality and cannot easily be replaced, and they are the ones getting hurt so badly. 

They cant use conscripts to replenish their junior enlisted and officer casualties without dramatically reducing what is already poor combat effectiveness, as they use a single year of conscription, of which 2-4 months of that is supposed to be training, part of remained will be used up with mobilization and demobilization, which means barely 6 months use out of them. 

Even crazier, Russian law prohibits using them in foreign wars (which means Putin has to either change that law or declare a national emergency to keep using them). 

Let's say they do what many are claiming, pressure conscripts to ""volunteer"" as contract troops for two years, then they're still going to be pretty poorly trained but worse there is going to be a major morale problem, as Russian conscription during war has been historically extremely unpopular. 

If they pull from their reserves, they're getting out of shape veterans, most of whom are former conscripts, who aren't at all ready for combat duties (only 10% or so of the total Russian reserves do any sort of drills or refresher training). 

And that doesn't even factor in officers. Russian junior officers aren't shake and bake 90 day wonders, they get 4-5 years of military academy schooling. Company, battalion, brigade/regimental, and division commanders often stay in the same command slot for 5-8 years at a time, only leaving for a more senior command position, a high level military academy course, or a prestigious staff assignment. So there aren't exactly a load of top notch officers just sitting around waiting to get called to go command a combat unit. Which means they're going to suffer massive downgrade of quality through attrition too. 

NATO just bought itself at least a decade of total respite from legitimately worrying about Russian Ground Forces.

Bucha is just the harbinger of genocide that Russia will bring to Ukraine if it manages to take control.

Ukraine cannot accept any position that sees Ukraine unable to have a military strong enough to defend its borders, or a peace that gives Russia any political control over Ukraine.  The Ukrainian people would be mad to accept any such conditions, as the obvious result will be mass death, and Ukraine forever being forced to be poorer, more impoverished, and more corrupt than Russia.  Again, look at literally any Warsaw Pact nation that failed to escape into NATO if you are confused on this point.

Surrender to Putin is not an option.  Any settlement that results in Ukraine being unable to defend itself from Russia is not an option.  The completely verifiable fact that Putin a compulsive liar means that any agreement isn't worth the paper it is written on.  Only agreements that fails enforce Russia's departing from Ukraine and fails to provide a mechanism to keep the Putin's murderous thugs from assaulting again once they regroup should be rejected outright.  

Putin is not a person that can be trusted, and what he says is mostly lies that conceal his real intentions and motives.

My earlier statements on Republican domestic political opposition were specifically in regards to the narrow point I wanted to make that there are people that will make relatively extreme statements that they won't be called on because it will get them an audience. 

As far as the Kremlin not walking back those comments... I think there is a frame of perception that is very important to think *carefully* about before you can conclude that the Kremlin NOT walking back those comments is evidence of Putin's intent to eliminate Ukrainian statehood. That frame is threefold: how RS is perceived inside Russia, by the Kremlin, and by people outside Russia.

People outside Russia (including many in this thread) appear to equate ""Russian state owned media"" as ""by definition, everything they publish has been either written by the Kremlin or the Kremlin told them what to write."" *INSIDE* Russia, however, RS may be perceived differently, and different pieces RS publishes may be attractive to different shades of Russian opinion. Example, for the Washington Post, George F. Will appears to be the farthest right opinion guy that got, with Jennifer Rubin being comparatively in the middle, if not trending liberal. When RS publishes, do they effectively have the exact same political slant on every article? Or is this piece one that is written by a far-right revanchist, and intending to appeal to people of similar sentiments? Or is this piece by the editorial board even?

In addition, the Kremlin may see RS as one voice among many that they control, or as a direct mouthpiece that is expected to be used as a semi-official way of making public statements. Each one of these frames has different implications for how we should interpret that particular article.

But 1)can't always be avoided, 2) can't always work, and 3) almost never works because defended buildings and urban dugouts are much harder to destroy with fires than most people realize. 

The US smartened up in the 1990s after watching what happened to us in Mogadishu and what the Russians experienced in Grozny and made urban warfare training a big part of focus. Its less now than it was back in the 1990s and 2000s, as we are focusing on the LSCO in rural areas, old school Fulda Gap shit, but we still do urban training, just not focusing on it.

*Russian forces in Izyum are setting conditions to begin offensive operations southeast toward Slovyansk in the coming days to link up with other Russian forces in Donbas and encircle Ukrainian defenders.*  
*Russian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts continue to make little to no progress and face mounting casualties and declining morale. Replacements and reinforcements from northeastern Ukraine are highly unlikely to meaningfully change the balance of forces.*  
*Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izyum to capture Slovyansk and threaten Ukrainian forces in Donbas with encirclement will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine. If Russian forces are unable to take Slovyansk, Russia’s campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail.*  
*The defenders of Mariupol have outperformed ISW’s previous estimates, and Russian forces are likely taking heavy casualties in ongoing efforts to capture the city.*  
*Ukrainian forces likely conducted successful counterattacks in Kherson Oblast in the last 24 hours.*  
*Russian forces have almost completely withdrawn from Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts and will likely completely vacate these regions in the coming days.*  
*Russian forces withdrawn from the Kyiv axis are highly unlikely to be effectively deployed elsewhere in Ukraine and are likely a spent force.*",e772489aa0e4b7711f3065e9520a31e5a42bd8a8,True,False,,,,,0,1649111366,,0,{},i3evvjb,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t3_tw09sv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3evvjb/,1649111379,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649082566.0,

With particular attention to the ineffectiveness of Taliban ""snipers"" in Afghanistan when compared to US forces, Iraqi Snipers, and the mad gunmen we see in the west who regularly manage to ambush multiple police officers despite nominally having the least training of any fighters anywhere.

Within US military counter sniper doctrine there are three classifications of snipers: 

Armed Irregular: untrained dude plinking with semi-aimed slow fired single shots. Their equipment usually sucks, they have shitty training, and poor fieldcraft. They can cause damage but mostly they harass. 

Trained Marksman: A trained infantryman who understands basic rifle marksmanship but has a better understanding that average, using a stock service rifle, possibly with a scope but maybe not. Similar to the US Army and Marine designated marksman. They generally don't have a good understanding of fieldcraft but they might be able to shoot pretty well. 

Specially Trained Sniper: Either school trained or On-the-Job, these are legit snipers, taught to use precision fires, proper fieldcraft, tactics, quality equipment including legit sniper weapon systems and varying types of surveillance equipment, comms, and possible ability to also call for fires like mortars, arty, and airstrikes.",d965e27ec438b1e6aa56cb99a4d86678e740160b,True,False,,,,,0,1649110245,,0,{},i3et6eg,False,t3_tqno01,False,True,t1_i2i9aa5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqno01/the_effectiveness_of_rifle_fire_across_cultures/i3et6eg/,1649110264,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649081445.0,

Now, on the western Front, India has a number of ""holding corps"" with smaller strike elements embedded in them.

This gives the Indian Army the ability to overlook the very route you have described by to do so with much greater striking power than what it had earlier. The key thing to keep in mind in this scenario is that the PLA has to defend the entire stretch of the CPEC passing thru that area. The Pak army can only do so much because they are also operationally restricted given their own security imperatives.

1. Bad planning (hard to stay motivated when you're freezing your ass off in a 30 year old tank with no food)

3. Feeling of being ""let down"" by senior commanders who push you down roads on thunder runs to Kyiv while surrounded by the world's best anti-tank systems
4. Lack of preparation in the run-up to the war for the rank and file. 

It also depends on *who* exactly committed these massacres. If the evidence is correct that these are specific troops selected exclusively for this mission then their morale is likely different than the average Russian conscript. 

Anyway my point is more so that the average Russian soldier (and a lot of the population writ large) has been primed to view Ukrainians in a hugely chauvinistic fashion where they're somehow ""lesser"" than the average Russian.

Short and medium range missiles pose many problems for deterrence and therefore stability. Their ability to accurately and quickly strike targets at a moments notice make them very deadly and hard to defend against, and can have the effect of making two opponents with anxious trigger fingers. This was one of the reasons for the ""Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"" that was signed between the US and the Soviet Union. Although this type of missile was not nuclear armed, it does threaten Pakistan's nuclear forces and Pakistan did go on a higher level of nuclear alert after this event. 

It seems that the two opposing sides of Pakistan and India are having to relearn the lessons that were learned in the West's recent past. I just hope they are able to do so before it gets out of control and gets us all killed.

Well, if you consider war as force for a political goal, I think it makes a great deal of difference, because it determines how that force is applied. To actually exterminate someone requires literal genocide of a bloodline.

Longer read:

First, maintenance. Maintenance is a bitch. Like, a real, real bitch, also, everything involved is expensive. But lets say you have a well-maintained system. Now you have to set it up, which first involves getting multiple pieces of equipment properly emplaced. Then hooking them together. Then hoping that no one has dinged anything they shouldn't, and that all the switches are properly switched - or not - and that no one drove a Humvee over the 6 figure cables running along the ground connecting all the equipment. Now you just need to boot up a computer system designed in 1969, which definitely always works without any errors.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

Anyway, now your system is booted up. Is it talking properly to all the launchers? Seems unlikely, but maybe it is. How about the radar? Because a box full of 2 foot circuit cards from 1969 is definitely extremely forgiving about all the bouncing it was subjected to en route to this position. But hey, lets be generous and say that you actually didn't move anything, and that it was all running perfectly when you turned it off last, and nothing has moved or been touched since. Surely the radar will turn on and work properly and there will be no issues when literally all you've done is turn it off for a couple hours and turn it back on, right?

HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA - 

Anyway. No wait, seriously though, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Just pretend I kept doing that. At any rate, this is the point where you call in a Warrant Officer. A WO is someone who drinks a lot of coffee that doesn't smell quite like pure coffee, has their hands in their pockets a lot, and in a Patriot unit, spends a lot of time employing what they call ""radar theory"" to fix your radar. ""Radar theory"" boils down to ""actual knowledge of how this shit works died with it's godforsaken creators, so now we just have theories about how to fix problems, primarily by swapping circuit cards around in accordance with the arcane superstitions of our class."" It also occasionally involves deciding that one of the cards needs to be replaced, which will only cost about have a mill or so. 

But hey, eventually, the thing is running and everything is talking. Time to for and forget right?

Haha- you get the picture.

Anyway, now you have two bity video screens running command-line interface, which - if the operators have properly entered their codes on startup (and they definitely know the meaning of what they entered in order to allow tactical flexibility and didn't just enter the most commonly used training setting by rote memory) - will become little screens with icons on them that make Galactica look like advanced tech. This screen is surrounded by many, many buttons. The operators know what all the symbols on the screen mean, and they know what all the buttons are for, and they know the buttons change to being for once they hit one button in order to open a menu, and they know what all the abbreviations on their screen mean and how to quickly and accurately tell the difference between birds, planes, radar mirages, other flying shit, other possibly not flying shit, and which of there are friendly, enemy, or neutral. Because once the enemy shows up, you may only have a minute or two - or less - to kill them before they kills you.

Oh and while there is a setting for automatically detecting and shooting down the enemy, [I really, really don't recommend using it.](https://spacenews.com/report-cites-patriot-autonomy-factor-friendly-fire-incidents/)

So yes, it's very easy to use and to learn and inexperienced operators will find it easy to use with no chance of things going poorly.",7c9ccc8f16527a7d4bdd3b1279b098e0f0cf561e,True,False,,,,,0,1649103439,,0,{},i3ebmyj,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3djzt1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3ebmyj/,1649103457,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649074639.0,
[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Crazy enough, the Russians actually consider their artillery to be a maneuver element in of itself and not a supporting element as it is in the US and other western militaries. They put that much stake in it. 

To effectively use artillery at the battalion level to support maneuver of the core element of a motor rifle or tank BTG they need to know where targets are first solid intel. Either they get that over a long process before a set piece battle as done in 2014 in the Donbas War, or on the move during an advance that requires drones, FOs in the forward units finding and giving proper fire missions and target locations, or other forms of recon. But the Russians appeared to have invaded without their BTG and brigade level drones, without recon elements operating on point, without artillery set up and ready to provide accurate and responsive fires, with strict ROEs (which obviously have since been loosened or removed entirely), and with MAJOR communication problems that have lots of units operating in the clear on single channel with no comsec, which means anyone with another radio can tune in to listen, interrupt them (which even Anon was doing), or jam them. 

And lets look at their logistics mess. Artillery, especially rockets (which is what they are really known for especially beyond the BTG level) is extremely logistically intensive. A single MLRS launcher requires an entire cargo truck of its own for a single reload. They invaded without the preplanned logistics set up for a sustained conflict and they can't just FRAGO that shit on the fly and expect to make up for in weeks for what should have been planned out and staged in the last half year. If they don't have a ready supply of artillery ammo, they can't be firing it. 

Plus, the Russians are largely road bound due to weather/mud. Its nearly impossible to properly deploy into an attack formation while stuck on a road, which is basically one big channelized kill zone. Combined arms is extremely challenging in this setting and absolutely favors the defenders, and that's not even assuming we're talking about defending roads inside urban areas, which gives a further challenge to the attacking forces and channels them even more.  

Also, the Ukrainians don't need to mass be be effective at defending, since they can maximize the use of restrictive terrain, they know the area so well and can pick and choose the locations, they are totally okay with an elastic defense, they have superior and secure C4I, and because of their incredibly high lethality of their weaponry acting a force multipliers, which means they can conduct successful defenses and counterattacks using small units, which is not what the Russians have trained on countering. The Russian system is focused on WW3 esque large scale combat operations, they're looking for the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) and Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT) by way of recon, movement to contact, intel, etc, in order to plan out a massed battalion, brigade/regt level attack, to apply their mathematical fires formulas, and then launch their attack. But that is not what the Ukrainians are doing, their very mobile defense appears to be confusing the shit out of the Russians who don't have a flexible enough system to counter it. 

Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, the Russian Ground Forces barely (if at all) conduct urban warfare training. Which isn't good since a lot of the fighting is now happening in urban areas, even if nothing but a village or town. Saying one excels at combined arms and fires is all well and good, but if all their focus is on open fields and they are stuck in a place they have claimed outright in their doctrine that they don't want to fight in that is a recipe for them failing on the attack.",bd622f8737940ccd5bfa685ff6352c084e3604b8,True,False,,,,,0,1649103426,,0,{},i3ebloc,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3dfcpc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3ebloc/,1649103441,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649074626.0,

1) I challenge the narrative that the Russians WANT to exterminate Ukraine as a people and as a culture. I don't really see that as a strategic objective, and I haven't found explicit statements from the Russian leadership (minor politicians with no real affect on the decision-making don't count) demonstrating that this is so. You are welcome to post your own. In regards to Putin's essays and how they relate to this, I argue that that was him attempting to lay the political groundwork for a *cassus belli*. 

It's more accurate to say that the Russians are WILLING to exterminate the Ukrainians to get what they want, and WILLING to use terror tactics but not that it's an objective itself.

2) I challenge the thinking that ""we can't negotiate with the Russians because they are *trying to exterminate us*."" (Emphasis added) If you accept point one above, and that the damage done is an attempt to demoralize Ukraine and the result of undisciplined and vengeful Russian troops, then how the damage done affects negotiations is that it both demoralizes the Ukrainians and makes certain sorts of compromise more difficult - it hardens resistance from those willing to resist. I'd be pissed too.

It'll absolutely never happen.  But, best case scenario is declare victory and bring all troops back to Russia.  Insist the operation was a massive success in killing Nazis and destroying Ukrainian military, so Russia is safe from the Imperialist threat for a generation.

The people who understand how badly this is going and how much worse it could get would hesitate to goading him into going back.  And the people who buy into his propaganda would accept that it was actually some sort of success.

&gt; It appears they've stalled out, but can they be conclusively defeated in Ukraine in the medium to long term?

Outright defeat probably depends on the West dedicating a lot more support in terms of equipment.  Everybody has been very cautious about giving Ukraine stuff like fighters, and that's gonna be a problem.  But even if we give Ukraine every Western MiG while we get them up to speed on F-16's, Russia can throw a lot of conscripts at the problem.  And conscripts are cheaper than the F-16 flight hours to bomb the conscripts, if you just don't give a shit about the human lives.  If Russia really wants to avoid making any decisions, they can keep the war going to no accomplishment for a very long time.

Such as armored vehicles, any hit by a AT rocket, ATGM, drone strike, etc that is enough to cause one KIA is likely to kill the whole crew by way of a k-kill that will brew up the vehicle, especially the older Soviet designed AFV without blow out panels or other major survivability designs built in.",69dc3f08be2b193902cee2ecfb70ede824fa460c,True,False,,,,,0,1649098643,,0,{},i3dyz50,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3doywh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3dyz50/,1649098657,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649069843.0,

You should be reading the pr statements and direct interviews from the wh and the state dept as well as from Russia. Don't just read what the press is saying what Russia is saying. 

This Ukraine issue is about national security. No great power would allow another to threaten it with threats at their border. Look at the number of US troops and US missile systems placed in NATO countries. Look at the countries that have US nuclear weapons. Cuba wanted to determine their own security and host nukes and the US would have made a move if the Soviet's did back down. How many countries in Latin America voted in/was about to vote in Communists before they stopped by a US invasion? Look how angry the US got over Turkey buying S400s. Now we are learning that Ukraine was acting as a defacto NATO country taking in US weapons, getting NATO training and wanting to host US personnel. 

The threat of nuclear weapon use is common amongst all those with nuclear weapons. The deterrence doctrine is only credible if you convey to the enemy that you are willing and able to use it. The US usually says, ""All options are on the table.""

That's an entirely over generalized comment. 

A SAW gunner spraying and praying like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ2SWWDt8Wg&amp;t) isn't suppressing shit because it'll be pure randomness if even a few rounds pass within 1 meter of an enemy, which is what is needed to suppress with small arms, according to numerous studies conducted by the British and Canadians. 

Meanwhile, a single rifleman with a semi auto only rifle with a ten round magazine capacity can suppress and entire US Army infantry company. How do I know this, because the Vietcong using SKS used to do that all the time in the Vietnam War. Similar, IJA rifleman with Arisakas were notorious for their ability to suppress/halt the advance of entire US infantry battalions with 1-2 shots. I'm not talking about trained snipers either, just riflemen.    

Where the SAW outshines the M16 or M4 in suppression is its ability to deliver more accurate automatic fire than rifles (due to overall weight and issue bipod and the notorious uncontrollability of even 5.56), in performing sustained fire due to it being open bolt, with a QD barrel, and extended ammunition capacity in the form of 100-200 round belts held in nutsacks or drums (though making the reload process extremely long when it does happen). 

Those are the pros. The cons are a LMG like the M249 is an extremely complicated weapon system that requires extensive training by the gunner to be truly competent to use it effectively. That its not very precise/accurate, especially since the rear sight/optic sit on top of the top cover which wasn't designed for repeatable accuracy, and that each barrel it uses has to be zeroed separately. That its heavy as fuck and its large ammo consumption because it only fires on full auto is also heavy as fuck too, creating a boat anchor in every fire team. That because its open bolt there is a higher danger of failure to feed malfunctions, which is why the SAW gunner is NEVER supposed to be on point or initiate an ambush. 

The pros and cons were weighed by Marines, or are not hide bound by tradition and thinking that squad organization was perfected in the mid 1980s, who believe the cons of the IAR are less than the cons of the M249.

In the chaos of the Russian advance, he told Science, looters raided a radiation monitoring lab in Chornobyl village—apparently making off with radioactive isotopes used to calibrate instruments and pieces of radioactive waste that could be mixed with conventional explosives to form a “dirty bomb” that would spread contamination over a wide area.

Simply put, they don't have an ""Up and Out"" promotion/assignment system like the US does, which means there is no incentive or emphasis to push successful commanders out of their command slots into other non-command positions, especially staff or ""key development assignments"" that are outside the officer's branch. Its not uncommon for top performing officers to remain in command of the same unit for 5-8 years, and only leaving in order to attend a high level military academy, to take over a more senior command, or the very occasional prestigious staff billet, usually at the general staff level. 

I hate the Up and Out promotion system as it promotes success at careerism as the chief attribute of all senior officers above all else: they excel at knowing how to get promoted. But the one thing it is really good for is ensuring there is always a fresh turnover of new officers, which works well in high attrition warfare. The downfall of the system that the Russians use is that it does horribly when hit with senior attrition, as those high performing commanders are the glue/bedrock of their units having essentially turned them into personal fiefdoms from so many years in command, and when they go, order and cohesion breaks down. 

Losing them isn't a total disaster, they still have systems in place to replace them within the chain of command the subordinates under them aren't supposed to be pieces of shit.

There's two storage areas at Chernobyl, named Interim Storage Facility 1 and 2 creatively enough.

ISF 1 is wet, that is actively water cooled, storage for spent fuel assemblies after they were first removed from the reactors. The fuel assemblies are stored in vertical concrete silos in the ground referred to as ""thimbles"" in english. These assemblies are quite large and have to be moved by a purpose built rail car.

If cooling on these is off long enough, there's a risk of them going dry and heat in the assemblies rising to the point that they damage themselves. I don't know the specifics of how hot stuff in ISF 1 is, but apparently the risk is material enough to have international groups concerned.

ISF 1 is here on the map: https://goo.gl/maps/r3Zvb6Bc4uUv2fGt8

I couldn't (quickly) find pictures of the storage itself, but the last page of this pdf has diagrams that get the idea across: [https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/\_Public/40/048/40048077.pdf](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/40/048/40048077.pdf)

ISF 2 is dry cask long term storage. The spent fuel assemblies from ISF 1 are repackaged into large concrete casks. These are then moved into horizontal storage cells by a crawler cart, and a vertical concrete slab seals the opening. These are uncooled and built for long term storage, a 100 years or so.

ISF 2 is here on the map: [https://goo.gl/maps/PoWn9bhJjt1k2uC86](https://goo.gl/maps/PoWn9bhJjt1k2uC86)

They started moving fuel into ISF 2 about two years ago. I don't know anything about the balance of material between ISF 1 and 2.

In any case, as you can see from the above, it would take a determined effort to access any of the spent fuel storage. In theory someone could try to remove material for a dirty bomb, but I'm very skeptical anyone would actually accomplish this. They'd have to move it out in one of the existing assemblies or casks, by rail or oversized road trailer, and it'd be rather obvious. These definitely aren't things were random Russian soldiers could open one up and take a souvenir, and even if they did it'd probably kill them in short order, particularly the stuff in LSF 1.

As for measurement / calibration sources, yeah, those could be dangerous. I have no idea what sort of stuff is used at that site, but, generally these sources are controlled pretty carefully when used industrially. I can't appraise the risk of an accident like what happened in Brazil other than saying therapeutic sources are often a lot stronger than calibration sources. I still wouldn't want to have the latter in my pocket. This is definitely the sort of thing someone might be tempted to steal as a souvenir or hoping to sell illegally.

So the last possibility I can think of is just picking up a random bit of debris. They buried everything they could from the initial accident, including scraping the top soil off a considerable area, but I suppose there's some remote possibility someone stumbles onto something that got missed. Also, I imagine someone could decide to act out their personal stalker fantasy and wander around inside the sarcophagus looking for stuff. That'd not be a great health choice depending where you go and how long you stay. I did read that the corium (the molten mix of spent fuel, metal, concrete, etc from the failed reactor core) has gotten softer over time, apparently more like a sand consistency now. The thought of some idiot going all dora the explorer to find the Elephant's Foot and take away a pocket full of it isn't pleasant, but again, seems pretty remote.

So overall I'd say the risk of looting is probably mostly those calibration sources and exactly how hot they are. Other scenarios beyond dora the dipshit giving themselves cancer seem quite unlikely, but I'm definitely no nuclear engineer.",5d660b17c38596975400f2bd1fb696bab06c3e4b,True,False,,,,,0,1649095344,,0,{},i3dqers,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3dbo6f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3dqers/,1649095358,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649066544.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;The way to look at it is like this. In the US a sergeant for example would be responsible for squad-level tactics, in the Russian military, it would be a captain. 

In Russian Ground Forces, VDV, and SOF, a captain is tactically commanding and controlling a company, not a squad. Lieutenants run platoons, sergeants run squads. 

First under the Soviet Union and now the Russian Federation, they've always had NCOs, its just that since the mid 1950s they weren't long serving like western nations or those the Red Army/Soviet Army possessed who had been in since WW2. For instance, a rifle squad would have a squad leader and assistant squad leader who were two year conscripts just as the rest of the lower enlisted, but would have attended a 3 month long NCO school after finishing the exact same training their lower enlisted did. The US Army had similar program during the Vietnam War nicknamed ""Shake and Bake"" NCOs, were the highest performing draftees in the infantry course would be sent to OCS and the next highest would got to NCO school, and everyone else went straight to Vietnam, whereas the newly promoted/trained officers and NCOs went to Vietnam immediately after they finished their training.  

Where the NCO vs officer difference really shined between East and West wasn't in tactical deployment but was in training and discipline. In the US and other western countries, NCOs run training and have since about the mid to late 50s (before that officers ran it too). But in the Soviet and Russian system, that has always been and still is the purview of the commissioned officers (who do much longer schooling than western officers receive) and to some extent the warrant officers. 

Additionally, the single at the platoon level, who lack a career NCO platoon sergeant, are entirely in charge of maintaining discipline in their units, whereas in wester militaries junior officers are usually not involved unless things need to be done officially (UCMJ). In the Russian system, the conscript junior NCOs didn't really have that much control and authority, which was one reason the ""Rule of the Grandfathers"" enlisted hazing was allowed, the senior privates on the last 6 months of their two year enlistments were the ones who maintained order when the officers weren't present. 

And after the 2009 New Look reforms, with the creation of a contract soldier career path that especially favored the creation of a legit NCO corps, things have gotten much better in the Russian Ground Forces, Airborne, and SOF.",c24ce178f086dcb7be8117a0a6837e9c5b9b3fc0,True,False,,,,,0,1649095102,,0,{},i3dprwz,False,t3_tot8d6,False,True,t1_i29zyk5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tot8d6/what_sort_of_effect_could_loosing_7_generals_and/i3dprwz/,1649095117,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649066302.0,

There were supposed to be [168 BTGs](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/army-btg.htm) in the Russian Army in 2021. If I understand their army structure correctly, for each 2 BTGs a unit should be able to provide a third one after mobilization. However, mobilization is either not happening or happening on a very limited scale. Which means the absolute upper limit of forces that have been committed so far is probably somewhere around 180 BTGs, probably fewer. It would equate to \~135,000 troops (90,000 in the inital phase and 45,000 of potential reinfrocements). A BTG consists of [700-800 people](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/army-btg.htm), Kofman says it's 750 on average.

Currently the lower end of Western estimates for Russians KIA is \~10,000. The wounded to fatality ratio of 3:1 thrown around here  lately seems to be too low for a modern conflict ([source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC28193/), [source 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC28193/)). There are also other factors such as desertion, surrendering. On the other hand some of the troops may be combat ready after a relatively short recovery. Let's accept the ratio for now bearing in mind that the estimates will be burdened with a high margin of error both because of the reasons mentioned before and the fact that it is difficult to get precise information about the number of Russian deaths. Combining this together gives us 40,000 casualties what means that the Russian Army has lost \~30% of their **total available manpower** (not just manpower committed to the conflict although both of these values come closer and closer to each other as the conflict progresses) for the foreseeable future.

The numbers are [supposedly](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/04/02/what-next-for-russia) only of casualties suffered by Russians themselves not by other forces involved in the conflict. Given the fact we don't have information about DPR and LPR forces we could assume the values are proportional in their case. There's also naval infantry, but they are [not a sizeable force (12,000)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Naval_Infantry) comparatively. I've read that PMCs from Wagner and recruited overseas won't be able to produce more than a few BTGs (can't find the exact data, but [they are probably just in thousands](https://theintercept.com/2022/03/31/ukraine-war-russia-wagner-group-mercenaries/) in Ukraine).

All in all 30% seems like a sensible ballpark given the limited information we have. It resembles a situation of the British Army in in the early stages of WWI a little bit when most of their forces (which were professional at the time) got decimated and they were drawing reinforcements from overseas colonies.

It's also worth to note a psychological toll the war will take on Russian soldiers. [Here's](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tvkofc/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_442022/i3bfk39/) an interesting insight from u/Duncan-M on this topic. 72% of troops that had taken part in the battle of Grozny in the First Chechen War suffered from some kind of psychological disorder with 28% of them exhibiting neurotic behavior.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;It’s incredible to me because literally 100 years ago the US Army looked at its First World War experiences, looked around at the rest of the world which was looking to adopt squad automatic weapons,

That's not at all what happened after WW1. The biggest tactical shift immediately after WW1 by nearly every military, including the US Army, was to integrate existing automatic weapons into the squad, leaving dedicated platoon level automatic rifle sections. Most also scrapped the rifle section too, getting rid of the half platoon tactical group. The M1918 was perfectly fine for the intended role.

&gt;So they did that, never developed a replacement for the BAR, even took the BAR out of the rifle squad just before WWII, and then in 1940 panicked when they realized that yes, they need a SAW.

No, that was entirely related to funding. They never had money in the 30s to develop and field an entirely new infantry squad level support weapon when they already had one. When they wanted it to have better sustained fire they spent limited money tweaking it. The money saved went to things like M1 rifles, more radios, more trucks, better artillery, and strategic bombing (which got the bulk of Army funding).

&gt;More specifically, it couldn’t deliver the sustained fire that a true SAW could due to problems with overheating and its lack of a quick-change barrel.

A ""true SAW""? There was no SAW back then, you're using a term invented in the 70s to describe something from the 30s. They needed an automatic weapon that could support squad and platoon level fire and maneuver, in addition to company LMGs and 60mm mortars, battalion HMGs and 81mm mortars, regimental 75-105mm cannons, and division 105-155mm artillery. 

&gt;The Army literally fought an entire war with a rifle squad and by extension rifle platoon and rifle company that lacked firepower

Two wars actually, Korea used a very similar TOE as 1945. But that wasn't the problem of the BAR, it was the problem of the M1919, specifically the A6, which was not a good LMG. 

When the Army solved their problem, the M60 GPMG replaced the M1917A1 HMG and the M1919 LMG, while the M14 replaced the M 1 rifle, M2 Carbine, the M3A1 SMG, and the M1918A2 BAR. There was initially a plan to use a purpose built M14 designed for automatic fire within the rifle squad, the M15, but that got scrapped.

That TOE led just into the Vietnam War where the M16 replaced the M14, otherwise nothing officially changed. M60 were still officially platoon level weapons that some units semi or permanently placed into a rifle squad but that wasn't doctrine. 

In fact, the first official US Army TOE that included a dedicated belt fed MG within the rifle squad was the mid 70s mech infantry M113 rifle squad, who possessed an M60. But light infantry rifle squads didn't possess that.

The fielding of the M249 in the mid 80s and equal fire teams was the first actual across the board inclusion of belt fed LMG, and that came with the cost of logistics, weight, complexity, lack of expertise, giving a crew served LMG to a single gunner, etc.

&gt;yet 100 years later the Marine Corps, which at that time was a champion of machine guns and automatic rifles, is potentially making the same mistake

Because they are challenging the very claim that a belt fed is needed in a rifle squad, especially in the day and age where super durable combat optics and IR lasers/night vision dramatically increase day/night small arms accuracies and lethality.

You seem to be unaware that the Marines already combat tested this new IAR in a combat setting that was small arms and squad level centric and it worked. If it worked there it'll work anywhere else.",9f6e7e8048f6e70573b07600b88c9789c09adeb0,True,False,,,,,0,1649093797,,0,{},i3dmawx,False,t3_tp3azv,False,True,t1_i29ga76,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tp3azv/the_usmc_just_confirmed_they_will_be_changing/i3dmawx/,1649093809,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649064997.0,

Also, just from what little I know about Russian history, it generally seems to change leadership through palace coup situations. So, if we're going to focus on some group to exercise change, then it should probably be on people fairly close to Putin and that seems like a longshot.

Any cultivation of a regime change has to be a longer term plan. And probably the best technique is just to help countries like Ukraine to keep growing economically. If they do better it becomes clearer to Russians and Belarussians that they're being left behind and dissatisfaction will grow. Otherwise, you're just swapping dictators and meddling from the outside. 

I'm worried about the Bucha situation in that there's going to be a lot less willingness to offer Putin a golden bridge to withdraw on and Zelenskyy is now much more limited in what he can accept as a ceasefire. 

People who want Putin charged with war crimes are right from a mostly moral perspective, but if we want to minimize more of that (I dread what's going to happen/is happening in Mariupol) then we have to find some kind of compromise to get Putin out of Ukraine sooner rather than later.

The theory is that nobody's going to press the button to stop one small, majority civilian convoy from driving through Lithuania. And once they don't press the button for that, they're not going to press the button to stop two or three or ten convoys. And once they don't press the button for that, they're not going to press the button when the eleventh convoy includes ""critical defensive equipment and materials"" needed to defend against the ""aggressive NATO blockade"". And once they don't press the button for that, they're not going to press the button when Belarusian military police set up a couple ""temporary stations for logistical support of the humanitarian operation"" along the route in Lithuania to aid with traffic control and civil protection. And once they don't press the button for that, they won't press the button to stop additional police and military equipment being brought in for ""civil protection and crowd control"" for self-protection against ""aggressive government-sponsored demonstrations"" along the route.

If NATO's overriding objective is to avoid escalation into a military conflict, and each step is small enough and reasonable enough that member states remain convinced that the situation can be defused with more dialogue, Russia could maneuver itself into a permanent military presence in Lithuania in the name of ""logistical and technical support of the humanitarian operation"". (Or ""protection of ethnic Russians against genocidal policies"" in Latvia, or ""prevention of illicit cross-border smuggling"" in Estonia, or whatever excuse they go with.)

I imagine analysts are no longer as worried about that scenario, given both the Russian military's demonstrated impotence and NATO's demonstrated willingness to escalate. The two are somewhat linked: if NATO will need to ship hundreds of thousands of troops and their equipment from North America and western Europe to have any hope of halting the unstoppable might of 1st Guards Tank Army, they'll be more conservative, and the Baltic states and Poland will feel more constrained in what unilateral defensive actions they can take. Whereas if Lithuania feels there's a good chance it could conduct a successful defense of its territory in the short term with prompt support from Poland because Russian conventional forces are a joke that stopped being relevant in 1988, there's a better chance of the whole scenario being nipped in the bud before it can meaningfully escalate.",d0ed7ce5283f476d5d06b0a70db5b4c337aec4e4,True,False,,,,,0,1649091576,,0,{},i3dgkdb,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3cwbnt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3dgkdb/,1649091593,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649062776.0,

This is evident from the composition of its BTGs, which despite being battalion-sized units, have more artillery than a U.S. BCT. One study referred to the Russian military as ""an artillery army with tanks"". This is also however, evident from Russian doctrine, which focuses on destroying the enemy through massed artillery fire, using maneuver elements like mechanized infantry and tanks to identify / fix enemy positions, briefly seize ground for subsequent use by artillery, etc.However, in addition to the many problems with logistics, airpower, etc., we've seen with the Russian campaign in Ukraine, one observation I have made is that I've seen a complete lack of successful use of Russian artillery by BTGs. On the contrary, we've seen Russian maneuver elements having to fight head-to-head with largely in-tact Ukranian light infantry units armed with ATGMs, which as noted above, is not what Russian doctrine generally calls on armor to do.With this in mind, I thought I would poll the community to see if y'all have made similar observations and if you knew of good reasons for the ineffectiveness of Russian artillery.

2 brief notes/qualifications. 1. I understand why there was very little artillery use in the first 3-7 days of the war, as it's now become clear that Russia's initial goal was to do a ""Thunder Run"" decapitation strike at Kiev, as is evidenced by the Hostomel airport operation. However, experts have noted that Russia mostly transitioned away from that strategy by Week 2 of the war. Despite this change, they've seen very little success. 2. We have seen use of artillery in indiscriminate shelling of urban areas.

* encircle Kyiv from the West themselves, freeing Russian troops committed for this to do other things elsewhere, in Donbas, Odesa, or whatnot ([Odesa offensive was definitely part of the Russian invasion plans that got abandoned fairly early](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/03/01/20/54814981-10565523-Alexander_Lukashenko_has_appeared_in_front_of_a_battle_map_durin-a-35_1646167865725.jpg)) - they wouldn't be taking Kyiv, or doing anything complicated, just sit there and blockade it from one side

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"ROEs dictate tactics and can play a major role in limiting collateral damage and noncombatant casualties. 

An example would be counter ATGM drills. If there are strict ROEs they can prohibit calling in arty to suppress suspected ATGM launch sites, especially in urban populated areas. Or maybe it's possible but requires communicated up the chain to the brigade/regimental commander to get permission (which could take hours) versus making an on the spot decision to fire at likely suspected areas with the BTGs MLRS using cluster munitions.

Another example could be civilians protesting the invasion in towns that been occupied. Dealing with them commits units to crowd control versus doing other duties, or they could be getting sucked into a situation where they're going to get ambushed. So are they allowed to break them up? If so, how? Are they limited to waving them off or tossing stun grenades? Can they wade in with riot gear and crack a few heads? Can they fire warning shots with rifles? Can they try to wound ringleaders with rifle fire? Can they just say fuck it and light up part of the crowd to send the rest running? And if so for any of these, who has the authority to make that decision? Can it be made right there and then by the ground force commander, even if only a drunken sergeant? Or do they need to spend the time going up the chain to get permission to escalate?

Let's say they take a mortar round and their counter battery radar tracks it to a local village nearby. Strict ROEs are founded on the concept of proportionality, the response being in line with the actions of the aggressor. But if they're looser can the ground force commander call in a retaliatory fire mission with air bursting white phosphorus and just burn out the whole village? ""That'll show em, send them a message not to mess with us"" sort of decision making. If so, who has the permission to authorize those?

From what I heard, during the first could days the Russians were, for the most part, actually following a rather strict ROE. And I've seen footage of them tossing flashbangs at protesters or firing warning shots over civilian POVs getting too close to their checkpoints.

Like a kg or less while mobile, some might be stationary sensors you basically deploy which are in the handful of grams range. Likely largely copter designs on power and in some cases ability to loiter longer by changing aerodynamics, using solar, or parking somewhere and waiting. 

When you get really small, solar and battery become adequate for perpetual power since surface area to weight ratio rises as you go small. Immobile Is cheapest but tiny mobile is too, and has the advantage of being able to cross arbitrary distances and be extremely hard to notice since they can go silent while they do it. 

Tiny drones (or immobile sensors too) can be constant radars that in aggregate form extremely clear imaging, which enable all sorts of other possible capabilities. You might say a few gram drone with a radar won’t be able to see much. That’s true. But a large number of them together will. If you need an ultra precise lock, draw into batteries and shine a brighter flashlight or more observations per second towards where you have interest, then it’s suddenly a lot easier to shoot at something really fast with a missile, projectile or even directed energy. Those also can do electronic countermeasures as a swarm under the same principle. The core idea is just to push it to smaller and smaller. Eventually your cost is less than even what C-Ram munitions cost, and every time those launchers fire, they do reveal where they are. 

Anyway, concentrating comms and sensors in tiny drones then allows a lot of your larger drones that have more ordinance and fuel sources that allow very fast movement to just be talking(and often only listening) to drones with directed comms and have a lot better stealth profile… or not even talk at all except maybe backwards to known secure routing drones to command.
 
You also can load varying levels of offensive capability into tiny and small drones to make them harder to counter. You don’t want infantry to be able walk around and destroy passive deployed micro sensors perched on rooftops and trees, so some need to have limited sprint propulsion with explosives or other weapon systems in a small percentage so that clearing them is time consuming. Same applies to your more substantial drone that has a rocket motor - every one can be an a2a or a2g missile and it’s a lot harder to countermeasure when your drone swarm can give it great data or potentially a laser ride to the very expensive very fast target

This all sounds a bit sci fi, but none of these techs require fundamental breakthrough to work, and it’s easy to imagine how it displaces a lot of current roles at partial maturity more cost effectively, and enhances other aspects of combined arms very significantly.

Still, as the war has gone through several phases, the Russian government has at least attempted to spin it each time.

How exactly is Russian domination over Ukraine, something Ukrainians obviously don't want, ""real sovereignty""? If you want to make a broader argument that smaller states are ultimately subservient to great powers, fine, but don't pretend that Russia invading Ukraine somehow protects their sovereignty - even buying into your framework, Russia is simply changing who controls Ukraine via force. 

There's a reason a lot of states in traditional Russian sphere opted to join NATO and the EU, and it's not because of disinformation campaigns or economics - it's because the Russian empire has a history of brutality and lack of concern over smaller Slavic states in its orbit. The unification of the Russian world you seem to think is necessary has a historical tendency to benefit only Russians.

To the contrary, the worlds collective refusal to recognize the Crimea as Russian suggests that any move by Japan to take control of the islands wouldn't be very unlikely to be recognised.

I think Nagorno-Karabakh is probably a closer analogy and the refusal of international recognition of Crimea is as much realpolitik as international legal principles(which I will admit both influences each other). The last time a referendum successfully effectuated an annexation is India's annexation of Sikkim in 1975, which informs India's position of at least theoretically supporting Crimea's accession into the Russian Federation under a free and fair vote. That was also the NATO/US position that the problem is not so much you can't do that in principle, but the the means of doing it was not in a free and fair vote, so territorial integrity must prevail and Ukraine must be given back Crimea then to drag it out further. The position has definitely harden on both sides. 

One also must not forget that in post Soviet collapse, several boundary agreements was reached by successor states to the Soviet Union with China on some of the most contentious borders in the whole world. I think if not for the fact Japan has a security pact with the Americans so you would have America using that to station troops right on Russia's far east, Japan and Russia might have reached a possible deal during that period.

I personally think some of my views on this subject are informed by the unique international legal personhood of the Soviet Union where you had in theory sovereign countries like Ukraine and Belarus all being UN members but are also all constituents of the Soviet Union, itself a United Nations member.

Japan prefers to have them back, but also was willing to compromise in a 2 to Japan, 2 to Russia deal at points in time, but not if United States uses that as an excuse to keep Okinawa.

Not exactly. 

The story is something like this: In 1956 the Soviets agreed to return to Japan Shikotan and the Habomai Island*s* after a peace treaty had been signed*.* The relevant passage is this: 

&gt;In this connexion \[sic\], the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, desiring to meet the wishes of Japan and taking into consideration the interests of the Japanese State, **agrees to transfer to Japan the Habomai Islands and the island of Shikoton,** the actual transfer of these islands to Japan **to take place after the conclusion of a Peace Treaty** between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Japan

The reason the Soviets agreed to return the two because that's what the Japanese had asked them to do during the negotiations. The Japanese having argued that Habomai and Shikoton had been ""part of Hokkaido"" and weren't therefore Kurils. The legal basis of Japan's claims were as laughable then as they are now; but the Soviets in 1956 figured they could offer the two islands as a sweetener to the Japanese with an eye to causing some friction between the United States and Japan. 

Then after months of negotiating, and after the Soviets had given ground they didn't have to give, the Japanese changed their tune and demanded Etorofu and Kunashiri. The Soviets declined and the talks were abandoned for a few months. Then when the talks renewed the Japanese... dropped their demand for all four islands and settled on two -- i.e. the Soviet offer. The declaration was then signed by both governments with the original Soviet offer in place and no other mention of territorial exchanges. 

The reason for the Japanese demand for the four is almost certainly down to American interference. You've correctly noted what was threatened: the retention of the American-occupied Ryukyus islands. But America's goal wasn't to keep the Ryukyus but rather to sabotage rapprochement between Japan and the Soviet Union. 

The complexities in Japan's position can basically be explained by the fact that there was no ""Japanese position"" per say. Rather, there were a bunch of different actors with different views. The two biggest players were: Hatoyama, the PM, who favored *at most* a push for two islands and Shigemitsu the Foreign Minister wanted four, but really seemed more interested in torpedoing talks and was willing to work with the Americans to effect that. 

&gt;On this, maybe it is just me, but I think I have heard that talks with Japan in retroceding at least some of the islands has actually driven people to move there in hopes of getting Japanese citizenship if that does happen, so I don't think it is out of the realm of possibilities, especially if Japan gives a good enough accession terms.  


There's like 2,300 people in Shikotan and Habomai *total*. The only inhabitants of the latter are Russian soldiers. The other two islands Japan demands have about 14,000 people. The Oblast these all sit in.... have lost, I think, around half their population since the fall of the Soviet Union. It's entirely possible some people are moving there to become Japanese citizens. But there can't be many of those. 

&gt;I personally find it slightly weaker than Soviet sovereignty, interestingly enough. The thing is the post Cold War settlement around boundaries in post Soviet space is actually more fluid than ever. You have Crimea going from the UkSSR-Ukraine to RSFSR-Russia, you have the business with Armenians and Azeris, etc. So I find the precedent of something like Crimea actually works to weaken current Russian argument about its sovereignty in Kurils, or at the very least strengthen the argument about Kurils having some inherent right to choose no longer being in the Russian Federation.  


I don't think the Russian claims are any weaker than the Soviet ones. I also don't think Crimea in any way weakens Russian claims either. To the contrary, the worlds collective refusal to recognize the Crimea as Russian suggests that any move by Japan to take control of the islands wouldn't be very unlikely to be recognised.",2824c84a7b3b7006418dd5771ce2490a75847f8d,True,False,,,,,0,1649072589,,0,{},i3c9z2k,False,t3_tqqfjo,False,True,t1_i3bfz33,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqqfjo/russiajapan_a_kuril_islands_conflict_there_have/i3c9z2k/,1649072604,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649043789.0,

However the supersonic speed, size, range, and the complexity of missions of fighters puts them as one of the last directly human operated airframes that will be replaced. If you had said attack helicopters as a CAS platform, I would absolutely have agreed with you. If you had an orbit of medium size drones today you could replicate a whole damn lot of the functions that attack helicopters provide, while having a longer loiter time, higher sensor saturation, and being much more stealthy. But, against a functional near peer force, the RF that drones emit is gonna get them blasted out of the sky, they aren't stealthy at all if they transmit data. And if they don't transmit data their utility really hampered, even the interswarm communication makes it somewhat possible to to target them. Generally what is killing aircraft / munitions isn't concussion it's going to be frag from the warhead. It doesn't really matter how concussion resistant drones are if they are light enough to fly they are light enough to get shredded by it. I'm curious what a specific drone in this swarm is going to look like to you, are they fixed wing? Quadcopters? How are they powered? What is the approximate weight of their warheads?

&gt;While this battle for the airport was under way, the main air assault force (7,000 more men &amp; their armored vehicles) arrived over the airport in giant IL 76 transport cargo jets. They attempted to land. Ukraine shot down two IL 76. Landing was aborted

There is no evidence that any IL 76 was shot down, considering the area has been retaken and it's quite populated that means that none were shot down.

The numbers are also completely unrealistic, we have no evidence that such huge forces landed at the airport, or that 200 helicopters were used as he claims.

Complete fabrication. The Russians have close to 2.1k operational tanks in their entire ground force. As usual with him the numbers are incredibly inflated. Hard to say how many tanks were used in the push on the western side of Kyiv, but it's probably in the low to mid hundreds. 

His story about the ruse the Ukrainians played on the 40 mile convoy (itself has been shown an inaccurate representation of the Russian forces, as it was actually a number of smaller individual convoys and defending forces with gaps multiple kilometers long in between them), is based on zero evidence. Since we do have some intercepted communication of the Russians, we have good indication that that's just not true.

&gt;The Ukrainian unit did what any convoy combat needs, they disabled (or destroyed) the first 3 vehicles at a narrow point on the road. It blocked passage forward. Then harassed the convoy as it grew longer and more congested

That kind of block would hold them a for some minutes, this is not a mountain pass, destroyed tanks can be pushed off the road. Moreover there's little evidence that the convoys were hit much on the road, many here wondered why that is at the time. Most of the Russian losses happened when they left the main road and spread out in towns like Irpin and Bucha.

So now that I've spent two months trying to figure out what this war is all about, and then I meet people like you to place the blame somwhere _completely different_... It's like someone declaring that the sky is red and that I'm obviously hallucinating.

I see an empire that's working to conquer whatever it's able to, with 500 years of history supporting that tradition. And recently, we've had 30 years of hoping things had changed with its European neighbors naïvely (conflicting with evidence) hoping that those times were in the past. 

This time, the imperialistic warfare is also spurred on by the fear of seeing a culturally similar neighbor turn into a successful democracy, which could undermine its very successful internal propaganda apparatus. Combine this with a weakening position in the world, with falling birth-rates and imminent reduction in the demand for their primary cash cow, fossil fuels. Having Ukraine develop and export their own, from the eastern regions, surely wouldn't help their strategic position in that regard.

Sure, having a long, open land border bordering someone friendly to the empire's geopolitical adversaries isn't a good strategic spot to be in, I'll grant you that. But if the Ukranian people want to adopt Western values and economics, following in the footsteps of Poland and the Baltics to greatly increase their wealth, they have every right to do that. We all know NATO would never invade Russia; this is just a fig leaf for the other justifications. ""Oh no, the small people in the south wants to stop us from being an empire, waaah waaah tears of anger and injustice"".

So then the empire invades, as it's done dozens of times before, brutally vindicating the worries of the Ukranian people. But this time, the rest of the Western world realizes that, fucking hell, it was still acting like an empire this whole fucking time and there's no negotiating out of it. This defensive battle will happen someday; today is a good time to fight it.

Too bad they're threatening to _blow up the whole fucking world_ if we send our own military to fight on the Ukrainans' territory, maybe we'll do it anyway just because that's a bad negotiating precedent to set for all the other empires out there. But for now we'll use the uncontroversial tools -- stop trading with these motherfuckers, use our economic power and send all the advanced weaponry we're able to.

Sure, this has consequences, and those are tragic. That's war, even if it's defensive. The propaganda was wrong; democracies do have a stomach for doing ugly things when it's necessary. But it sure doesn't make it harder when  a flood of rapes, indiscriminate shellings and summary executions are discovered and reveals that yes, the Red Army does indeed still walk in its own footsteps.",822c1106472bd64583ecafa1ee7090abe3191759,True,False,,,,,0,1649062080,,0,{},i3bw3ol,False,t3_tva2jv,False,True,t1_i3azi21,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tva2jv/ukraine_megathread_april_3/i3bw3ol/,1649062093,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649033280.0,

Quote from the Article:

&gt; The ability of Iran to continue to project power and sustain its economic viability despite American-led sanctions is a valuable case study that deserves further examination. The Quds Force has become critical to Tehran in this regard, through its networking and relationships with anti-western states and non-state actors. The value of the Quds Force’s dual role as both a paramilitary and a tool for foreign relations to the Iranian government cannot be underestimated. By efficiently organizing black market oil sales and illicit drug trafficking, the Quds Forces has created a stable and self-sustaining financial empire independent of traditional economic structures. Thus, the Quds Force has become the sine qua non of the current Iranian regime’s well-being and only by disrupting this revenue stream can Western powers hope to mitigate the threat that Tehran represents.

Submission statement:

I came to this article because of the situation with Russia at the moment, where it has been heavily sanctioned with likely more to come. It is interesting to look behind the curtain a little to see how the Iranian Quds force is navigating the similar difficulties that it has been experiencing for a number of years now. 

And the picture is one of extreme amorality in a seedy underworld where the sale of opium is the driving economic force and the partners are from Mexican cartels like Los Zetas, Russian and Chinese intelligence services, terrorist groups like Hezbollah, the Assad regime in Syria and various drug kingpins from around the world. The Russian intelligence services might be delving deeper into this world to make money as the Iranians have, and with their much more considerable intel services it should very interesting to watch.

The Taliban just banned the cultivation of opium. How this will impact the illegal drug economy that Tehran has become dependent on through their Quds force is something that I don't know, but worth keeping an eye on.

[],False,,Unlucky-Prize,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ksvu6ky,False,True,"From a really generic systems perspective, full sized fighters have an incredible amount of equipment built with an incredible amount of fault tolerance crammed into a very tight space. They also have a ton of complex defensive equipment because they are so expensive and cannot be lost. All of this is very expensive and also requires a lot of high tech manufacturing process and immense maintence complexity and cost. 

If you can focus on simplicity/specialization, and remove the need to protect any one piece of equipment, you should be able to get way better economics and possibly similar capabilities (minus some of the maximum speed). 

There's also a core limiting aspect of fighters which is human pilot - maximum acceleration, decision making speed if processing a lot of inputs, etc, which drones eventually benefit from.

I agree with you, no drone today replaces the best fighters. But it's a new form of tech that SHOULD at some point, and I think if you go down the thought exercise, it becomes a debate about 'when'. Some people say 50+ years. I think it's within 10 years for anyone that cannot access the very best stuff, and 20 for the best powers. I worry it could break MAD in later incarnations, btw, but that's another discussion.

To the other posters comment, a lot of the drone swarm problem that makes it, to your point, not that impressive today, is command and control related (the other being in my opinion just sheer volume - a drone swarm needs to be hundreds or thousands of drones, many of which would be quite small, and thus like trying to shoot a 100 mph concussive force-resistant duck taking evasive action out of the air with anti-air artillery). But there are near-term solutions to the command and control issues by using drones to create their own peer-to-peer network.  And, the economics of simple naturally redundant systems vs complex concentrated ones will put a strong tailwind at the back of this I think...

So I agree with you, not there yet, I just think the theoretical maximum is a lot higher than fighter jets, and think it's a question of when. Because I can theorize feasible fixes for most of the problems people talk about, that feels sooner than later to me, and an economic question as much as a development one.",889e386ffad25264389a3d52c3a89b353a32ab40,True,False,,,,,0,1649051557,,0,{},i3bj50p,False,t3_tvbjuf,False,True,t1_i3aidth,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tvbjuf/the_long_range_fires_gap_no_longer_is_us/i3bj50p/,1649051570,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649022757.0,

Eh, yes. [Soviet GDP contracted by 34%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II#Gross_domestic_product) between 1940 and 1942.

&gt;The Soviet Union was either the second or third largest economy in the world during the entire war. Competing with Germany. A lot bigger than Britain at the time.

Nope. The USSR fell from 2nd place in 1941, and that's if we ignore other countries' empires/conquests. In 1942, the USSR's economy was barely larger than Japan's empire and 2/3 of Germany's, again without the latter's conquests. The U.K. had a larger GDP than the USSR until 1944, after which the two countries were essentially tied until postwar.

&gt;Russia is miles behind what the Soviet Union was before, during or after ww2 in every regard except nukes.

That's nuts. In 1990 constant Intl' $, the USSR's pre-WWII GDP per capita was \~$2,000, whereas in 2021 Russia's was \~$17,000. Russia is a vastly more developed country today than prior to, and during, WWII.

&gt;You're absurdly wrong here.

That you arrive at that conclusion is stunning to me.

&gt;Throwing bodies without logistical support isn't going to do anything. More bodies that are horribly equipped might even make them less effective at acheving their goals. The zerg rush is not a real military strategy.

* Anger at NATO and certain Western countries for enabling Putin and/or not doing enough to help, with the heaviest criticism going to Germany and (to a lesser extent) France. 

* Strong belief that the killings reflect a larger campaign of genocide against the Ukrainian people and that more evidence of horrors will come to light in the coming days/weeks. 

For many Ukrainians, I think, these atrocities have reinforced the impression that they're engaged in an existential struggle for the Ukrainian *nation* and that defeat would mean the loss of not just their political sovereignty but also their culture, language, and historical identity.

I'm sorry, but that's just silly. General mobilization obviously costs money, but it also **generates revenue** for the government by redirecting financial flows toward the war effort. Right now Russia spends \~3.8% of its GDP on defense, out of total government spending of \~37% of GDP (2021 IMF data).

As for equipment holdings, Russia has taken substantial losses, but its not running out of equipment either. Take MBTs: according to the IISS, Russia had 3,417 in active service in early 2022. Ukraine lists 644 Russian tank losses for February 24 - April 3, some of which are from the DPR/LPR.

Thus, in 5 1/2 weeks Russia has lost a little over 15% of its active MBT holdings. It has a further 10,200 older models in storage, which can gradually be reconditioned in the context of general mobilization.

Russia can also produce more tanks.",2025449fe6b47471f445f81e5808368d230a69c3,True,False,,,,,0,1649035100,,0,{},i3aogog,False,t3_tva2jv,False,True,t1_i3abb0l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tva2jv/ukraine_megathread_april_3/i3aogog/,1649035111,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649006300.0,

They can of course mobilize, but wouldn't do anything about the situation in Crimea if Ukraine somehow manages to take it (which is the hypothetical).

Usage of WMDs will most likely be responded to by NATO in some way or another which is why they aren't using them at this point. Nukes will likely trigger either a conventional entry as retaliation or a proportional strike on Russian possitions. A part of the game theory around nukes is that you have to respond in kind for them to have any deterrence effect.

Yup. 

&gt;but the argument is much weaker for Russian sovereignty today(as opposed to independence/self rule of some form/right to self determination)

So yes, technically, *part of* the Kurils *maybe* isn't Russian. As you said, San Francisco says ""it isn't Japanese"" but there's been no formal peace treaty between Russia and Japan to decide *just whose it is*. Russia's position is that it's controlled this stuff since 1945, that it was promised it under a variety of wartime agreements, plus it doesn't belong to Japan. That's a fairly strong legal argument, so far as these things go, and most everyone just accepts it. 

But to really seal the deal, Russia needs to sign a treaty with Japan that gets Japan to recognize the transfer. That hasn't happened because Japan decided after 1956 to hold the USSR's feet to the fire by demanding ""the southern Kurils"" more or less in exchange for recognizing the transfer of this and other territories. This was only possible because the US decided to back them to spite Russia. (It's more complicated than this... but that's the *basic setup*). So one could argue that the parts of the Kurils is *technically* stateless. 

And no, I don't think the argument for Russian sovereignty today is weaker. I doubt the islanders want to be independent of Russia.

The language isn't really ambiguous. To argue the Kuriles means only the southern Kuriles, you've got to ignore the treaties explicit use of ""Kuriles"". You also have to ignore the context of San Francisco entirely. Yalta and Potsdam make it very clear what Japan's territorial borders were to be after the war. The USSR had already taken those territories awarded to it under the same. And there's no question that the US and the other allied powers who signed San Francisco knew that the Kuriles were to be part of the USSR.
