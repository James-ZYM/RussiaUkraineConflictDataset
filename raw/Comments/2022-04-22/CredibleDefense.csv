I don't disagree with this. You seem to be intent on having a debate that I am not participating in. If you'll go back and *actually read* my original post you'll note that my contention was twofold: that Putin was *solely* responsible **and** that regime change would produce favourable outcomes in the west. The post-war norm on non-annexation, the rules based international order, these are things that are [surprisingly weak,](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/why-is-the-post-ww2-non-annexation-norm-weak/) and more often than not, excuses for the exercise of power. Again, I don't *disagree* with this. I am a large proponent of the liberal international rules based order - I just don't pretend it's all rainbows and humanist unicorns. Ultimately states exercise power to maximize their own power while minimizing / containing that of their adversaries. I

&gt;One might. But why would one do that? Either-way it will not accurate.

Take it up with Kofman and a host of other foreign policy scholars then. 

&gt;You can't disagree about value of human life. Turning Mariupol into a ruin isn't a matter of a political disagreement. There's no logic that can justify that. Shelling of other cities, atrocities in Bucha, and just in general invasion of a neighboring country falls under the same umbrella. The fact that we're debating THIS in the west is a sign of intellectual cancer and moral bankruptcy.

Oh please, we play god with the value of human life *all the time.* This is one of the cornerstones of foreign policy debate! We were not, for example, willing to expend billions of dollars and a long-run occupation of Afghanistan just on the hope that we'd achieve some sort of long-run political settlement. Ultimately the taxpayer and the voter decided that the lives of Afghans were simply *not worth it.* At the risk of sounding callous here, we have no desire to engage in war with Russia mostly because of nuclear weapons because the cost of Ukraine is not worth even one mid-sized American city. No one is going to make that trade. 

Believe me, I understand where you're coming from: I have family in Mariupol living through this nightmare. I have been to Ukraine and to Russia - this issue is close to my heart.

**A briefing by the Deputy Commander of the Central Military District restated the standing Russian objectives in the current phase of the war: capturing the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and defending Russian positions in southern Ukraine against Ukrainian counterattacks.**  
**Ongoing purges of Russian general officers for failures in Ukraine will likely further degrade Russian command and control.**  
**Russian forces seek to starve out the remaining defenders and civilians in Mariupol’s Azovstal Steel Plant and are unlikely to allow trapped civilians to leave.**

[],False,,Acies,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mz6e,False,False,"I hear this a lot about airplanes but I'm kind of curious what the basis is, and what level of proficiency the pilot gets to over the course of the year.

The US and many other countries obviously train their pilots extensively because fighter jets are expensive and they want them to be used effectively, and train them to be as good as they can possibly be before they put them in combat.

But the Ukrainian pilots are flying old planes, and based on interviews with them one of the main issues with their planes is that once they fire a missile at an enemy plane, they have to keep their plane pointed towards the enemy plane so they radar can guide the missile to the target. Russian planes have modern missiles that allow pilots to take evasive action without the missile losing it's target. We also have modern missiles that our modern planes can use to do the same thing. That seems to me like a significant disadvantage.

So I take it for granted that if a Ukrainian pilot wants to be as proficient as a trained American pilot in an F-35, F-22, F-16 etc, they probably need a year to get to that level. But the question I never see answered is how long the Ukrainian fighter pilot would need to train to be more combat effective in a modern plane then they are in the outdated tech they're currently using. My understanding of most learning curves is that you can pick up an awful lot quickly and then spend a long time refining the details, so things like the Ukrainian claim that they could have combat ready pilots in a couple weeks don't seem absurd to me. Would they lack the knowledge of American pilots, and some of them die because of their lack of experience with the plane? I'd assume so. But they're dying now because they're flying antiques, so the real question is which path would be more dangerous.",ef50f8eb745d22f224b8ca1c58d6215f7b8fd519,True,False,,,,,0,1650668133,,0,{},i5t6otx,False,t3_u9cyxj,False,True,t1_i5st6m4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9cyxj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_22_2022/i5t6otx/,1650668150,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650639333.0

Eh, I take issue with this statement. Prior to Feb 23, NATO was unwilling to explicitly state this and continued to arm and train Ukraine. One might argue that over time Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO (absent the Article 5 protection). Kofman said as much in [his fabulous piece](https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/putins-wager-in-russias-standoff-with-the-west/) from January of this year:

&gt;There are two overlapping issues: The first is Ukraine, where Russia desires to have a firm say over its foreign policy as well as aspects of its internal governance. The second is to block further NATO expansion and to roll back Ukrainian defense cooperation with NATO members. Moscow perceives its strategy in Ukraine as having generally failed, with diplomacy over the Minsk ceasefire agreement at a deadlock, while Ukraine is increasingly treated as a de facto NATO member. 

Foreign policy is every bit as much about trajectories as it is about facts today. 

&gt; It also didn't have bioweapons, or nuclear weapons. and wasn't killing Russian speakers in Donbas.

I never said this so I do not know why you are bringing it up. 

&gt;Why would we EVER entertain Russian imperial ambitions at all? Short of nuclear blackmail

I have never stated we should. My position has been clear on this so, frankly, I don't even know who you are talking to with this question. 

&gt;If buck stops with Putin, then the war is ENTIRELY PUTIN'S FAULT. All the ""Yes, but...""; are only relevant in so far as exposing Putin's illogical way of thinking.

Interesting take. Do you know of someone else in the Kremlin who would have taken a different policy direction with regards to Ukraine? ISW has a [great piece](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20Report_The%20Kremlin%27s%20Worldview_March%202019.pdf) on the buildup to the war that is worth a read. Note the lack of the term ""illogical""   and the explanation about the fusion of the Kremlin's foreign policy with Putin's. Again, labelling your adversary as ""illogical"" because they make decisions you disagree with is a starting point for bad analysis and bad foreign policy in general (see: American forecasting in the runup to WW2 vis-a-vis Japan, explained in Ian W. Toll's [excellent anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Crucible-War-Sea-1941-1942/dp/B0064I1BJ6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2BRECRQ1F5ZJC&amp;keywords=pacific+crucible&amp;qid=1650667161&amp;sprefix=pacific+crucibl%2Caps%2C142&amp;sr=8-1))

The purpose of my comments is to provide nuance and discussion around the various ways in which the current crisis has unfolded and potential ways forward. As I said in my original post, the narrative is certainly clear, but there are elements of it I agree and disagree with. For example, I do not think that Washington and Kyiv have a 1:1 overlap in terms of their interests in this conflict and, as the conflict continues, I think that will actually make decision-making in Kyiv much more difficult.

While certainly the buck stops with Putin, the Ukrainian question (and more broadly, Russia's relations with its former satellites) has been a defining feature of post-cold war Kremlin politics. I posted this in a thread the other day but allow me to repeat myself - to quote the current CIA director and former ambassador to Russia, Bill Burns: 

&gt;Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin’s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.”

My point is less that Putin isn't at fault, more so I would like to dispel the notion that the Kremlin is liable to pursue some sort of other policy avenue with regards to Ukraine. Maintaining Ukraine in Moscow's sphere of influence has always been a priority - the only thing up for debate (in Moscow) is how to best accomplish this. 

&gt;They're not on a verge of being competitive with NATO.

We are in agreement here.

&gt;You're dancing around what you're trying to say here. Your whole writeup is ""we don't see the whole picture"", ""social media influence campaigns"", ""back-channel diplomacy"", ""Illuminati runs the world and eats babies"".

This is simply not true but allow me to be clear: we are missing *significant* information that informs and impacts our ability to predict outcomes. I don't believe I spoke of ""the illuminati eating babies"" (highly unlikely in my opinion).

[],False,,Conor_J_Sweeney,,,[],,,,text,t2_891hwz03,False,False,"Typically armored vehicles are painted with camouflaged primarily to hide them from aerial spotting or attack. You aren't really going to hide something as big as a tank from ground troops with just a paint job. If you *do* want to hide an armored vehicle from ground forces, you're going to move into an at least partially hidden position and apply things like netting and local plant matter to break up your silhouette and any bright markings can be covered up with a tarp if they're still visible at that point.

When it comes to air spotting though, bright white markings like the Z on many Russian vehicles or the white star seen on most allied vehicles during the Normandy invasion during WWII *are* highly visible from the air, and that's the point. In both cases, the forces painting the markings expected total air-superiority and therefor it was more important to be identifiable as friendlies than it was to hide from a virtually non-existent enemy threat from the air. They also aid in offensive operations in general, where it is far more common to accidentally bump into friendly forces unexpectedly due to the highly fluid nature of offensive mechanized advances. 

We can also see the flipside of this, as both the Ukrainians in the current conflict and the Germans and Italians in WW2, who expected to be vulnerable to air attack, refrained from such markings and in many cases put more work into painting and maintaining camouflage rather than going for a simple solid greenish coat of paint.

Yeah something I noticed he did too, but downplaying that is pretty damn silly given that US forces at the time noted that was the major reason the German army fought to the bitter end and were begging to have the policy altered to hasten the end to the war.

I note too he totally ignores the 1943 offer to end the war and coup Hitler and FDR refused to even entertain despite Canaris himself offering to bring FDR's representative, Earle III, to Berlin to meet with the conspirators so long as he got it in writing that the Soviets wouldn't occupy Germany.

The deals that the conspirators tried to make ended with the failed coups since they were pretty much wiped out.  The people then trying to cut deals were the Nazis, specifically Himmler.  Of course the Allies ignored them all.  

&gt;I don't know how the Casablanca declaration influenced Hitler before Stalingrad fell and he said that Germany had ""burned its bridges"", although I do think that most historians consider it a factor.

Not sure what you mean.  Hitler had tried repeatedly since the start of the war to negotiate, but was rebuffed or ignored the entire time.  the Casablanca declaration only cemented the notion that it would only end with military victory or total defeat.",fc669b0d8bfdeed58de8f634307780cbd8243643,True,False,,,,,0,1650661159,,0,{},i5sqzpq,False,t3_u92w52,False,True,t1_i5sfh5e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u92w52/why_did_the_german_army_fight_to_the_end_dr/i5sqzpq/,1650661175,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650632359.0

Allowing Ukraine to retake this territory without escalation would be tantamount to accepting the loss of any other piece of Russian territory without escalation, especially since such an operation could only be performed with the aid of US/NATO supplies.

In a face-to-face confrontation with militants from the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion who had launched a campaign to sabotage the peace initiative called “No to Capitulation,” Zelensky encountered a wall of obstinacy. 

With appeals for disengagement from the frontlines firmly rejected, Zelensky melted down on camera. “I’m the president of this country. I’m 41 years old. I’m not a loser. I came to you and told you: Remove the weapons,” Zelensky implored the fighters.

Once video of the stormy confrontation spread across Ukrainian social media channels, Zelensky became the target of an angry backlash.

Andriy Biletsky, the proudly fascist Azov Battalion leader who once pledged to “lead the white races of the world in a final crusade…against Semite-led Untermenschen”, vowed to bring thousands of fighters to Zolote if Zelensky pressed any further. Meanwhile, a parliamentarian from the party of former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko openly fantasized about Zelensky being blown to bits by a militant’s grenade.

Though Zelensky achieved a minor disengagement, the neo-Nazi paramilitaries escalated their “No Capitulation” campaign. And within months, fighting began to heat up again in Zolote, sparking a new cycle of violations of the Minsk Agreement.

[],False,,uriman,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ecmn,False,True,"Zelensky came 3 weeks ago with a proposal signed by the negotiators giving up NATO membership while seeking security guarantees from NATO members, providing recognition towards Crimea and a debate regarding the Donbass and providing Russia with veto power in regards to Ukraine hosting exercises with foreign militaries. This was the first ever written concessions that Ukraine ever proposed in 8 years after not adopting Minsk and provided Russia with an offramp to end the war. However, this was right before Bucha and as a result of what cynics believe was incredible opposition to not give one inch of concessions to Russia by both domestic right-wing nationalist competitors to Zelensky and the NATO/US establishment, Zelensky backtracked on those proposals and peace negotiations overall. 

The NATO/US establishment seem heavily pushing for a continuation of the war making this a proxy war that effectively degrades Russian military and economic strength without loss of US/NATO lives. Moreover, if you consider the US military budgets alone during the Cold War that effectively totaled to trillions targeting Russia/Soviets, the millions provided so far have been highly cost effective. I do not think that complete victories by either side are realistic or being pursued, and that the more realistic option is that Zelensky or someone who would replace him to will eventually start turning away from these external/nationalistic pressures and go back to the negotiation table as more Ukrainian lives are lost and cities are turned into rubble. I would expect this mainly coming from the ground swell of sentiment coming from the people who would want a conclusion to fighting. I would expect him to start blaming the West for not arming them earlier and the West for blaming them for losing the momentum/interest to continue the fight. 

At the end of the day, NATO is refusing to step in and Ukraine is alone in fighting a behemoth that is powered mainly by commodities that appear to be minimally affected by sanctions. Ukraine's economy is being pounded into the dirt and even with Western military supplies that likely will not out produce or be sustainable in a long conflict with Russia. Even with only domestic industries, Russia is just chugging along and Ukraine's is being devastated. Zelensky's ask of $7B / month is really telling.

My biggest concern would be if Russia decides that they've invested so much in the war effort that they need way more concessions than before the war. There's talk of a [New Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya) or making Ukraine land locked. There's also huge concern that the sanctions are hurting the West a lot more esp Europe with food and energy prices drastically rising. China, India, Latin America, the Middle East, Turkey, Africa, &amp; SE Asia minus Aus/NZ/Jap/Korea are already not participating and those participating cannot stop the major percentage of Russian exports being energy and commodities. I'm seeing fertilizer prices jumping 5x and that's affecting spring planting and feed prices for meat and eggs. Western Europe coming off cheap Russian pipeline gas and going to expensive LNG traded on the world market will structurally make their exports uncompetitive. This would be similar to the current Europe to Asia flights where Western airlines have to make gigantic detours and Air Korea can still go through Russia. France, Germany and Italy have the potential to eventually pull back from sanctions. This likely could end up as another Afghanistan debacle for US/UK as Europe turns away from sanctions with dramatic cost of living spikes and Ukraine turns towards ending the war and providing concessions to Russia. What I hope is that in the chaos during that time the Stingers don't end up shooting down some Israeli or German airliner.",36b55802ceac850b8024eb79195097e9e049daa4,True,False,,,,,0,1650657391,,0,{},i5shzgd,False,t3_u9cyxj,False,True,t1_i5rqdcd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9cyxj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_22_2022/i5shzgd/,1650657405,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650628591.0

And because It see's its troops as disposable it likely isn't putting much effort into how they are cared for. Be that medical, Food, Shelter, etc...

Time is on the Russians' side as well as the material war, so they have no real need to go fast at this point and as it stands if Russian claims are even half true they've pretty much wrecked Ukrainian military infrastructure and are smashing up western gear before most of it gets to the battlefield.  This fighting slow strategy is a major drain on western resources more than Russian ones, especially with economic sanctions crippling Europe by limiting their energy supplies, so the combination of the lower paced sustainable war the Russians are fighting coupled with dumb sanctions by the west are meant to wear down the economies of the EU so that they eventually face political pressure to end the war and for Ukraine to concede to whatever Russia wants.  When the food crisis hits and Europe faces mass migration of starving Middle Easterners and Africans they will have to cut off aid to Ukraine entirely and potentially abandon working with the US if they keep demanding a more forceful policy towards Russia since their resources will be tied up trying to keep out hordes of desperate people trying to get in. 

This war is a proxy for a much wider global conflict vs. the US and is really being fought out economically.

Russia conquers all of Ukraine, from Lviv to Luhansk, and decapitates the central government. Ukraine is for all intents and purposes another Oblast of the Russian Federation.

~~Plan B~~: 

Russia takes all of Ukraine East of the Dnieper+Kyiv+its Southern coast, decapitates the central government, sets up a puppet rump state for Western Ukraine. 

~~Plan C~~: 

Like Plan B, but Zelenskyy stays but Russia forces him to sign a humiliating agreement for a ceasefire. No NATO, no EU, guaranteed neutrality, demilitarization, ""denazification"". 

~~Plan D~~: 

Like Plan C, but somewhat less harsh, Russia forces Zelenskyy ""simply"" to accept Russian rule East of the Dnieper and on the Black Sea coast. 

Plan E: 

Forget everything above, just capture the Black Sea Coast (still coping for Odessa) and the entirety of the Donbas region.

Ok, forget Odessa, just capture the entirety of the Donbas region plus the length of the Black Sea coast from the Donbas to the Dnieper by Kherson. 

Plan G: 

Russia can't hold on to Southern Ukraine that well and attempts to settle for the thinnest possible strip of land linking the Donbas to Crimea (yes Mariupol but no Kherson, Melitopol, or Zaporizhzhia). Russia still guns for the entirety of the Donbas region here. 

Plan H: 

Like Plan G, but Russia decides to fall back to the 2014 lines in the Donbas and consolidate those puppet republics. 

Plan I: 

Russia achieves none of its aims and withdraws to the 2014 lines; they can't even make a land bridge to Crimea. 

J (does this even count as a ""plan"" anymore?): 

Ukraine makes an attempt to retake the Donbas region and succeeds. 

K: 

Ukraine makes an attempt to retake the Donbas region AND Crimea and succeeds: a complete and utter Russian defeat and humiliation.

Honestly it depends a huge amount on the injury in question and whether on site stabilization is possible.

This is not the most likely scenario, but it's absolutely possible. 

There's no way in hell Russia is going to get a better deal than return to Feb 23 ceasefire lines, with zero recognition, and no meaningful concession. If they ask now, that's what's on the table.

Then the most likely scenario is that Russia will throw ""separatists"" under the bus, and keep unrecognized Crimea. Ukraine would likely take that offer.

But what if Russia refuses further? Well, then Crimea is back on the menu. Ukraine already took the first step - sinking of Moskva effectively neutralized the Russian navy. They'll have to stay far enough from Crimea to be a non-factor in the fighting. There's one stupid bridge to destroy. After that, Russian forces in Crimea are really screwed.

[],False,,Antique_Result2325,,,[],,,,text,t2_940py60c,False,False,"This is just me spitballing, but here is my thoughts on what a potential end result could be like:

Complete Russian victory:

* Russia controls all of Ukraine, which becomes something akin to Belarus. Russia has real power over the government, people, resources, etc.

This is especially unlikely now, and not worth considering except for why Ukrainians were so willing to fight in the first place-- Belarus is a cautionary tale here. Plus past relations with Russia and general fuckery

&amp;#x200B;

Complete Ukrainian victory: 

* Ukraine completely pushes Russia back to not just pre-invasion borders, but retakes Crimea and defeats the separatist movement within Eastern Ukraine

This also isn't going to happen-- whilst they could defend against Russian movements West and potentially push back and control the claimed territory of LPR/DPR, taking back the area they occupied is much harder. Crimea is effectively impossible to retake

&amp;#x200B;

Significantly longer-spanning conflict

* Lower level intensity fighting persists in Eastern and potentially Southern Ukraine, no formal recognition or concessions

This seems unlikely, but important for both parties to consider in terms of the costs of not reaching a negotiation, which would be high for both sides, if not untenable

&amp;#x200B;

Points of negotiation in a settlement, listed from most to least favourable for Ukraine

NATO membership / Neutrality:

* NATO membership
* 3rd Party security guarantees from a country with capacity and willingness to defend them (depends on DPR/LPR + NATO's own stance, if the former is settled and NATO is willing to let them in then the outcome below could be preferable)
* Ability to join NATO... eventually (pre-invasion status quo)
* 3rd Party security guarantee with a state that has no willingness nor capacity to defend them
* Forced neutrality 

&amp;#x200B;

Denazification (much less clear):

* Nothing
* Azov claimed destroyed by Russia and disbanded, reorganized, maybe something about teaching Russian language
* Parties and political groups labelled as Nazis banned 
* People and politicians labelled as Nazis arrested and imprisoned by Russia

&amp;#x200B;

Territorial integrity: 

* Ukraine goes back to pre-2014 boundaries
* Pre-invasion boundaries 
* No formal recognition/settlement over Crimea / Donbas Ukrainian, granted much greater autonomy
*  Recognizing Crimea as Russian (formally) / DPR/LPR independent breakaway states, Russia gains and keeps land bridge permanently occupied 

&amp;#x200B;

There might be other things that come into play-- Ukraine shutting US funded biolabs, etc. but I think most people recognize this as distraction

Any of these are up to negotiation based upon the cost benefit analysis of either side, however territorial claims are very likely to be wholly determined over what each country can actually take and keep, over general performance/elsewhere

&amp;#x200B;

With the continued Western support including now drones (think akin to Switchblades), heavy weapons, tanks, artillery (and shells) etc. as well as continued Ukrainian resistance hopefully we can see them resist the upcoming Russian push effectively.

I think most likely thing that would change the situation significantly is Russia undergoing further (not necessarily, but potentially general) mobilization. This would be domestically very unpopular, take at least many months to both train and somehow get additional equipment to new troops (with this taking even longer, unpopular and expensive the more troops mobilized)  
Internationally bad for Russia as the West ramps up production to continue to be able to support Ukraine, and remaining neutral countries forced into a more awkward stance

I think you need to read more about Ukranian - Russian (and Soviet) history, killer.  Ain't no history of peaceful coexistence.  

If we only go back a century, there was a war after WW1 between Ukraine and the Soviets, and that fed into Stalin's purges and starvation of the Ukranians (the Holodomor).  When the Nazis rolled into Ukraine they greeted them as saviors freeing them from Moscow... until they turned out worse than Stalin.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"It's a trade off. Yes, you want camo (though it's usefulness is limited unless stationary) but you also want to reduce fratricide, which is easiest by Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) markings. When possible it's best to limit IFF markings to not compromise camo too much, such as having dismounted personnel or vehicle markings without exceedingly bright colors or covering too much, just enough that friendlies can see it when looking specifically for it. You don't want the IFF marking to be something that causes the object to be spotted in the first place, but what someone can use after spotting it to make a decision whether it's a friendly or bad guy.

When it comes to dismounted personnel, there are better ways of doing it then colored armbands or St George's orange stripes. For instance, making all troops make/use something like a ragtop/cabbage patch/ghillie helmet cover not only increases camo when motionless but it's VERY recognizable when they're moving. Plus if they are spotted, helmets are likely a key item that will be seen (as will shoulders, hands, weapons). Another example can be the Israeli helmet cover ""chef's hat"" that also helps with camo but again, also very recognizable. It's one reason to use a very distinct camo pattern nobody else uses that might even be a bit unconventional. The skies the limit, though if I were the ""good idea fairy"" tasked with that assignment I'd do better than colored tape.

When it comes to armored vehicles, the white painted V or Z or O on the sides isn't that big a deal. It's not too contrasting with the surroundings, it's not like they painted the turrets and cannon barrel all white. It doesn't do anything for thermal sighting. It doesn't overly compromise them when they're stationary trying to hide. Its kinda pointless actually, if anything it's not distinct enough to notice from ground since they're only limited where they put them (and also didn't standardize the location), nor air since white isn't easy to spot (that's why florescent orange or red are used for signaling panels like the VS17), nor does it help with thermal imagining.

They had a policy of *korenizatsiya*, translated to indigenization, where they would deliberately try to encourage local languages and cultures. 

[Here's an interesting comment on /r/askhistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s2hgan/the_soviet_union_had_various_programs_and/hsfeeak/) about it.


They would even go to the remote Siberian places where people spoke Turkic languages with no literary customs and try to create a written system for that language, they would promote local ethnic leaders into the government bureaucracy and actually made a serious and concerted effort to be a multicultural union with Russian de-emphasized. 

This included Ukraine, which saw a widespread increase in the usage of the Ukrainian language

&gt; For several of the small nationalities in Russia that had no literary language, a ""Committee of the North""[9] helped to create alphabets so that the national languages could be taught in schools and literacy could be brought to the people in their native languages—and the minorities would thereby be brought from backwardness to the modern world.[10] And in the very large Ukrainian Republic, the program of Ukrainianization led to a profound shift of the language of instruction in schools to Ukrainian. 


So when Putin said in his invasion speech that the USSR ""created"" the Ukrainian national identity and language, it's a half truth. They certainly promoted it, successfully. 

Problem is, of course, these Soviet policies did not last very long. After the first couple decades, they started seeing the rise of ethnic tensions and ethnic Russians grew distasteful of what we could now call ""affirmative action""

&gt;  there was indication it was encouraging inter-ethnic violence to the extent that the territorial integrity of the USSR would be in danger.

For one, while it's true the Nazi leadership fought to the end,  hundreds of thousands of German soldiers were surrendering en masse.

Contrast this to Japan where the surrender rates were much lower, but by spring of 1945 Japanese leadership was looking for a way out(something we knew through signal intercepts).  

Grew, Stimson, Forrestal et al believed that dangling a ""we aren't going to kill the Emperor"" would rapidly expedite the surrender process, and Stimson even extracted a promise from Truman to include it in the Potsdam Declaration, which John Byrne promptly had removed.

Whether or not the atomic bombings were justified or moral(I do not see them as materially different from the firebombing campaign, and if we were going to invade Japan of course we would flattened the dispersed industry), the fact is the Truman administration took steps to make surrender less likely, in opposition to what many of his experts and cabinet members thought.

&gt;In general, HOW will the Russian command “repel” a concentration of fresh FAU formations, for example, on the borders of the Kursk and Belgorod regions, in a month or two? If they go on the offensive, how will they be repelled? Police detachments... or a regional militia? The regional militia has not yet been created !!! ...

&gt;Could it be that our military agreed in advance with the enemy that he would behave strictly within the framework of the plans of our glorious General Staff? During the ""first phase of the special military operation"" this strangely did not work. There were significant losses for the participants. And I don't think in the ""second phase"" it will be any different.

&gt;So, summing up, I conclude:

&gt;Without at least partial mobilization in the Russian Federation, carrying out deep strategic offensive operations in the so-called ""Ukraine"" will be impossible or extremely dangerous. We must prepare for a long and difficult war, which will require all the human resources that are now being squandered poorly for ""a flag above the next city council"" [ Russian and separatist military usually hold flag-changing ceremonies in villages and in conquered cities ]. The ease with which the flag can change again is there for all to see, Gostomel and Bucha leave no room for lies.

But the pomp with which the hedonists, who have already made it out of the pot many times (in all fields) thanks to false, chatty and mediocre, ""present""; does not inspire me with great optimism.

They can both be rational but fundamentally opposed. That is the essence of the Thucydides trap, and we're only in the early stages of any actual power shifting to China.

In China's shoes, of course I would work to pursue a strategy of securing my critical ocean routes (the fake islands), strengthening my military capabilities, and using belt and road investments to secure both maritime access and natural resource access in poor countries. I would also work to shift the international system to be more in my favor (e.g., AAIB, pushing RMB-denominated contracts, etc.). Those are all rational.

As the US/west, I would try to strengthen the areas of influence I need to retain (e.g., key sea routes, etc.) and prevent all the Chinese actions above, which incrementally reduce the power/centrality of the US/west. That is also rational. 

The fundamental difference between these rational pursuits is the moral justification for the means employed. Western gov'ts are far from perfect, but for centuries, the US has symbolized freedom and equality to the world, and their actions have been interpreted as those of an actor with shared ""western"" values. Again, this is a broad strokes interpretation which the US has contradicted many, many times (SE asia, south america, Iraq to name just a few). China's methods on the other hand, are openly amoral, without any broader value system underlying them - they are designed to benefit China, period. This is a weak ground on which to build strong consensus or partnership with other states.

As Machiavelli said - if you cannot be both feared and loved, it is better to be feared. The US has been both feared and loved in the way they wield their power. The Chinese approach to wielding power is based solely on fear. Unfortunately, the US has degraded the love people have for them, and if the US loses their ability inspire fear, then any remaining love will fade in the face of external challenge, just as Machiavelli warned.",1a89785c708bde6efd67bb38d0a7ecfc34427984,True,False,,,,,0,1650632291,,0,{},i5qrxyk,False,t3_u8cu2e,False,True,t1_i5lkcq5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8cu2e/solomon_islandschina_deal_australias_leaders/i5qrxyk/,1650632305,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650603491.0

It seemed rather a dry and simplistic concept with an obvious answer at first, but it very well written and it won me over by the end of reading it.

The 1948 war in Israel is not a conflict that I have read about before, as it never seemed as interesting as 1967 or 1973. But it was much more dynamic with pitched battles and air power turning the tide then I had imagined. The author did a good job choosing a conflict that is interesting in its facts, applies well to his theory, and is not much covered in research.

Abstract:

&gt; What good is military strategy? According to the scholarship on military effectiveness, the answer is “not much”—strategy does not significantly affect the performance of armies in combat. Strategic theory scholarship disagrees and describes four specific mechanisms linking strategy to military effectiveness: Exploiting weaknesses in the adversary’s strategy; causing psychological dislocation in the enemy commanders; creating a favorable center of gravity and pattern of war; and focusing resources and controlling violence in service of political goals. This essay uses a case study from the southern front of the First Arab-Israeli War to explore how strategy affects military performance. We find that Israeli General Yigal Allon’s military strategy significantly increased the combat efficiency and battlefield performance of the Israeli Defense Force, consistent with the mechanisms suggested by strategic theory. These findings suggest that military strategy is indeed an important determinant of military effectiveness.

I pulled some quotes that stuck out to me while reading:

&gt; While Egyptian forces were overmatched tactically, their poor performance was largely the result of poor Egyptian military strategy and good Israeli military strategy. The lack of a clear policy and military strategy for Egypt laid the foundation for the tactical deficiencies of the EEF (see Gerges 2007: 157). In contrast, Allon’s strategy reshaped the conflict in Israel’s favor, significantly increasing Israel’s military power through mobility, surprise, and deception (Eshel 2004: 23).

&gt; Therefore, instead of attacking an Egyptian strong point, Allon planned for a deep envelopment into the Sinai, cutting off the supply line from Egypt to Gaza (Tal 2004: 905–906). Such an advance would place Israeli troops well within Egyptian territory. Allon neglected to inform his superiors of this part of his strategy, fearing that “political impediments” might rob the IDF of an overwhelming victory (Morris 2009: 362).

&gt; Operation Horev also achieved Israel’s central goal of expelling Egypt from the Negev, but at significant political cost and in a manner at odds with the policy defined by Prime Minister Ben- Gurion.

&gt; The IDF quickly dispatched their air force, which consisted of a handful of Messerschmitts, Spitfires, B-17s, and other civilian aircraft, to destroy the Egyptian’s central air field in El ‘Arish, grounding the Egyptian’s planes and giving the IDF air superiority. The Egyptians were caught completely off guard and suffered significant losses in the coming air raids

&gt; Allon’s strategy against the EEF at the southern front of the First Arab-Israeli War displayed all four mechanisms described in our analytical framework. Each mechanism had the predicted effect to either decrease the combat efficiency (and overall performance) of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force or increase the combat efficiency (and overall performance) of the Israeli Defense Force.

&gt; The comparison of men and materiel suggests that the EEF was not at a disadvantage with respect to numbers of soldiers, vehicles, or aircraft. According to Pollack (2004: 27), “there was no time at which Egyptian forces did not have more and better weapons than their opponents.”

&gt; One reason why strategy is not emphasized in recent studies is the difficulty in identifying the causal mechanisms linking military strategy to combat effectiveness. This essay proposes specific ways in which military strategy directly affects combat effectiveness. We believe this innovative thinking opens new avenues for research on military effectiveness, outcomes in war, and the importance of good military strategy. Indeed, we expect future studies will find that many outcomes attributed to operational practices should instead be attributed to strategy.

&gt; Much of the scholarship on strategy emphasizes grand or national strategy and therefore misses the importance of military strategy. At the same time, military strategy has been overshadowed by the study of operational practices. While the concept of military strategy has been neglected, it has also been subject to a frontal attack by recent scholarship, arguing that decisive battle is a myth and most wars are won by simply wearing down the opposing side (Nolan 2017; Nolan 2019).",6a936b30f0a76291968db764ee54daa7d7068461,True,False,,,,,0,1650631816,,0,{},i5qqzjv,True,t3_u9dp84,False,True,t3_u9dp84,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9dp84/what_good_is_military_strategy_an_analysis_of/i5qqzjv/,1650631828,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650603016.0

I have 2 observations:

First, while I am not familiar with Neitzel's work, in particular, I am aware of the combat capability of the Wehrmacht in the timeframe that he mentions. I would not go so far as to say that the Wehrmacht's cohesion had begun to diminish. Rather, I would say, the degradation of its combat power was increasingly evident. In reality, this was evident from l, some would argue, late 1942 though I would say, the evidence for it is stronger from mid 1943 onwards. As is well known, there are a number of reasons for this. Important among them were (1) Nazi Germany was scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of manpower even by late 1943 (2) There was a distinct lack of equipment even though production levels were higher than when the war began (3) Most importantly, the Germans lacked fuel. There were also other reasons . For example, by 1943, the Germans has lost their ability to enforce local air superiority and thus their offensive operations were exposed to Allied air interdiction operations. This was predicted by, among other Rommel, who faced it both in the latter stages of the ""desert campaigns"" and during the opening phases of the Battle for Normandy. The other reason, particularly, on the Eastern Front was the scale, scope and size of the Soviet Armies that were bearing down on the Germans. One can gain an idea of what was involved by looking at the ORBAT of both the side during the Battle.of Seelow Heights.

So, I would not say that the Wehrmacht was unwilling to attack. As the Ardennes operation showed, they returned their lethal effectiveness when taking up.offenwive operations, but they were hampered by, among other things, the aforementioned points.

Second: with ref to the court-martials. This is a very interesting topic. What I would like to know is the age and rank distribution of those who were convicted and executed. That would give us an insight into which part of the Wehrmacht was being affected and that would, in turn, allow us to looking I to some of the cuasual factors. Superficially, it can be said it is likely that many (but not necessarily a majority) of those convicted and executed were from the Volksturm and/or auxillary services who had been pressed into battle. Of course, regular military officers - across ranks - were also subjected to these measures for reasons that ranged from ""perceived cowardice in the face of the enemy"" to abandoning one's positions, internecine power struggle within the officer corps and between organs of the State (especially the SS), which was accentuated by the fallout of the July 1944 plot, and likely in many cases simply misinformation (the example of Gen. Weidling which was depicted well in the movie ""Downfall"" is a case in point).

In sum, I would be careful how I frame the question regarding why the Wehrmacht fought to the bitter end and in identifying some of the reasons for this.",874f91c8a6c72e1fd8c3f814dfb948a21f6381af,True,False,,,,,0,1650623935,,0,{},i5qdxey,False,t3_u92w52,False,True,t1_i5q9s23,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u92w52/why_did_the_german_army_fight_to_the_end_dr/i5qdxey/,1650623946,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650595135.0

It would a little given there's been no public data to suggest that's the case.

&gt;And they absolutely intended to clear them.

After SDD sure, but if they were intended for Block 3F then why wasn't it in the SDD weapons integration plan or otherwise spoken about? Lockheed of all people would've been happy to advertise additional capabilities being added into SDD.

&gt;So now we're okay with adding weapons mid-SDD? You do realize that the GBU-38, 31, and 32's all share the same software? And that they already cleared the 31s and 32s for internal release, so why couldn't they clear them for external carriage and release after they already flew around with them on the wings?

Because range and test fleet availability was a noted limitation; performing full envelope testing, separation testing, WDA testing, etc was simply beyond what they could afford, especially with the program under so much scrutiny.

&gt;Also, the GBU-54 argument is weak - the GBU-39 was also certified in SDD, and they both entered OT within a year of one another. The GBU-54 has distinct advantages over the GBU-12, which is why it was developed as an urgent operational need and rapidly fielded.

That same rapid fielding is why the GBU-54 failed to make it onto the F-35's SDD weapons integration plan; GBU-39 meanwhile was a program of record when Lockheed was awarded the JSF contract.

&gt;And yes, I'm well aware the 38/54 are being certified - curious as to why the 500 pounders only, though? Especially for the 38s going on the wings!

Because how often do you need 6x 2000lb weapons on a single airframe?

&gt;Sidekick was considered for AIM-120. But what if they want to fit some other missiles in there? 

Then they can look into that for a later revision.

&gt;And how big of a scale is that modification going to be?

I'd expect it to mainly involve a mod to the F-35's QRLS; I can't see them involving something like a bulkhead replacement.

&gt;DOT&amp;E doesn't deal with that. DT does.

DOT&amp;E is responsible for reporting on what DT &amp; OT finds, particularly when those findings involve major restrictions to planned system capabilities and KPPs.

&gt;So like I said, they had issues with development of TR3 (referencing the hardware) and integration (the software piece) so it might not even enter production as planned.

Fair enough, though I still doubt any delays are going to be significant.

&gt;And because the F-16 today is barely relevant? 

How is the F-15 any more relevant?

&gt;Range, single engine considerations (e.g., being able to glide back ashore if you flameout and can't airstart), etc. 

Range is a somewhat fair argument though it's less relevant when you're either operating in permissive environments where tankers are fine to operate nearby, or when your primary role in / near contested airspace is to deliver cruise missiles and other stand-off weapons. Single engine I'd argue otherwise from a statistical standpoint.

&gt;Agreed, but keep in mind, the Air Force isn't just looking at 15 years from now - it's looking at 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, etc. from now. When they keep bringing up the need to reduce the age of the fleet, they're raising flags about the falling readiness rates of their platforms in the near term, and the need to bring capability up to speed quickly in the near term as well.

I suppose, but only 2 F-15EXs have been delivered so far and AFAIK only something like 6 operational jets are planned for delivery by the end of this year; the newly accelerated procurement rate of 24/year will certainly help but those accelerated deliveries similarly won't start until 2025 at the soonest.

&gt;They're clearly focusing heavily on the Pacific problem, and there are few platforms that can carry big weapons at range, and the F-15E/EX is the closest thing to a bomber if you want heavy payloads at long range, while also balancing long term desires (e.g., keep researching NGAD and keep developing Block IV capabilities).

It's a nice platform, but I think the core of my concern is that a lot of the F-15EX's future relevance is reliant on purely hypothetical payloads and for those that materialise I'm not sure the F-15EX will always be the preferred choice either due to cost, range / endurance or survivability reasons.

Like the F-15EX would be great for hypersonics, but right now ARRW is in a bit of trouble with its funding being halved, HAWC is cool but only an S&amp;T program, AMRAAM-ER isn't a program of record, nor is air-launched SM-6 (and I'm skeptical in general of the concept of using F-15s as BVR missile trucks), Congress ordered an analysis of NGJ for F-15EX but there's been no progression beyond that yet (USN NGAD is also planned to eventually replace Growler, plus unmanned platforms could offer longer endurance EW), SHiELD is behind schedule and also just a tech demonstrator, etc (and similarly unmanned platforms could be more useful when carrying such a pod).

But either way, I'll put my trust in the USAF; they're by no means immune to bad decisions, but they are the ones that have done the actual analysis work, and have a far better idea of how things public and classified will look by 2030, etc.",e6b881077df453c0fc1bdb512dcadb0c84924088,True,False,,,,,0,1650617255,,0,{},i5q5www,False,t3_u7g1m9,False,True,t1_i5pteri,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7g1m9/air_forces_math_on_the_f15ex_and_f35_doesnt_add_up/i5q5www/,1650617268,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650588455.0

What does this mean? Does it mean belief in the ""wunderwaffe"" propaganda? If yes, then I am not sure it really affected the rank and file of the Wehrmacht especially after August 1944. Further, even the Wehrmacht's top echelon did not actually believe in the operational efficacy of these promised weapons leaving aside their limited and questionable deployment (for example, Rommel arguing with Hitler about using V1 and V2 rickets against the Allied beachheads in Normandy and the embarkation ports across the Channel). 

If the reference is to the fictional armies and divisions that Hitler was playing around with his coloured pencils on the map table in his bunker (and even earlier in his HQ), then his general knew they were fictional (for example, Wenck's alleged ability to attack and Steiner's last ditched breakthrough battle to relieve Berlin).

Blaming bad shit on the just dead guy is 100% guaranteed to happen.

The difference is that Hitler actually had an ideology. If the Nazis were not already thoroughly defeated, they would have been able to carry on based on it. Putin has no clear ideology, just a few memes. You could scare Germans into fighting with images of raping, pillaging barbaric soviets; it's hard to see how to mobilize Russians against, what ...

Russia is invading Ukraine for extremely clear reasons in my view. It’s sort of like with the Nazis. The “theological” justification for the war has been mapped out by Putin in his essay last year and in his speeches. This war has been there since 2014 it’s just European leaders tried to pretend like it could be resolved.

My guess is he tries to push as far as he can to the Dneiper, create a land bridge and declare another separatist Republic. I doubt he could directly annex land. They are staking everything on some battlefield victories in the coming 3-4 weeks. 

In a peace deal he compromises and allows Ukraine to join the EU but not join NATO. This would be an empty gesture since a nation cannot join the EU with a land dispute. Ukraine would then permanently lose access to its Eastern territories.

The other alternative is Ukraine pushes back and the separatist regions remain independent and Ukraine recognizes Russian seizure of Crimea.

If the Russians get pushed back to 2014 status I would guess there is a palace coup and Putin resigns or gets murdered.

[],False,,NGAD_Driver,,,[],,,,text,t2_cuw2uer4,False,False,"&gt;426 gal tanks are only ~3000lb each; the inner wing pylons on the F-35 are rated for 5000lb and the jet's 70,000lb MTOW allows for about 22,500lb of total payload.

Look more closely: Lockheed's own PR slides have only ever said ""70,000 pound class"" for both the A and C, which have different MTOW weights. They have never given an exact number, which is perfect since the general public that sees this won't have access to the flight manuals with specifics.

Would it surprise you if one was much closer to 60,000 than 70,000?

The Lockheed slides are also the ones that give the ~22k payload capacity, which is mostly just them adding their rated pylon station capacities. Station 1 &amp; 11 at 300 pounds each, 2 and 10 at 2,500 pounds each, 3 and 9 at 5,000 pounds each, and 2850 for the two internal stations each. Station 6 and the C is another 1,000 pounds.

&gt;They also perform static tests with CBU-105s, etc; doesn't mean that they were working towards certifying them for Block 3F (rather I'm pretty sure they were being used as generic masses for flutter, loads, etc testing). This slide you linked earlier for example is from the early 2010s; with a program as problematic as the JSF program they weren't going to try and expand the scope of weapons certification mid-SDD.

They aren't using actual captive carry stores without intent to integrate and clear them for release. Remember, what happens if you have an emergency and you have to jettison them? 

And they absolutely intended to clear them. The Navy even slapped on the 2,000 pounders during carrier suitability trials. You aren't doing 99% of the work to certify dropping a 2000 pound JDAM then simply not doing it.

&gt;That mainly just comes down to the timing and bureaucracy side of things; GBU-54 had barely entered production (and hadn't seen operational use) when F-35 SDD began and GBU-49 was selected to augment the GBU-12 later in SDD because it could be certified rapidly owing to its near-identical separation physics. As it is, GBU-38/54 are in the process of being certified for all 3 variants, with the process expected to be finished this year.

So now we're okay with adding weapons mid-SDD? You do realize that the GBU-38, 31, and 32's all share the same software? And that they already cleared the 31s and 32s for internal release, so why couldn't they clear them for external carriage and release after they already flew around with them on the wings?

Also, the GBU-54 argument is weak. The GBU-39 was certified in SDD, and they both entered OT within a year of one another.

And yes, I'm well aware the 38/54 are being certified - curious as to why the 500 pounders only, though?

&gt;I'd be surprised if they didn't run into issues, but any issues that they run into with TR3 is just going to be with software; the hardware itself will be a big jump from TR2, but ultimately they're still using quite mature technology like with most military avionics programs.

You'd be surprised, sadly. These computers aren't just individual COTS processors, but rather an entire housing including power supply and processor arrays (think more like a server rack). A myriad number of issues, such as not being built to spec, not meeting tolerances or reliability, or issues with hardware not working well with the code, are all issues that have occurred in various DoD projects over the years with what should have been relatively simple obsolescence replacements

Keep in mind too a lot of the old hardware were so outdated and often filled with proprietary interconnects that you're also now dealing with new hardware talking to old interfaces they were never designed for.

&gt;I can't really see Sidekick requiring any modifications beyond the aft-heavy weapons bay mod

Sidekick was considered for AIM-120. But what if they want to fit some other missiles in there? 

&gt;That bay modification is included with Lot 15 alongside TR3.

And how big of a scale is that modification going to be? What needs to be retested? Pax River is retiring some of their oldest test birds (the non systems test jets) already because they are no longer usable for where the plane is going.

&gt;As per the DOT&amp;E; nothing that would preclude heavier external payloads.

DOT&amp;E doesn't deal with that. DT does. DT figures out what is cleared and capable. OT decides whether what DT has given them is usable and useful.

On that note, on the topic of TR3, DOT&amp;E's FY21 report even states:

&gt;The program had to stop work on some development efforts in late CY20 and CY21 to redirect funding to the development of the new Technical Refresh (TR)-3 avionics configuration due to significant
cost overruns and reductions. Further delays in the TR-3 development and integration may affect production delivery of aircraft delivered in the TR-3 configuration. 

So like I said, they had issues with development (of the hardware) and integration (the software piece) so it might not even enter production as planned.

&gt;For the air policing / CONUS air patrol role, why not just stick to F-16s?

Range, single engine considerations (e.g., being able to glide back ashore if you flameout and can't airstart), etc. And because the F-16 is barely relevant? The National Guard deploys regularly too - just because they might do an air policing mission CONUS doesn't mean they don't deploy to areas that could turn hot quickly.

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"It's not necessarily impossible to protect Seoul. Taking out NK artillery much faster could allow relatively minimal Iron Dome defenses to provide excellent protection.

For example:

* 10,000 Tomahawk Block V would cost $20B.

* 200 MQ-9 Reapers including associated ground control stations and support/maintenance equipment would cost about $18.6B.

* 200 F-16s would cost about $6B.

* 12,000 Hellfire II missiles would cost about $1.2B.

* 12,000 GBU-27 bunker busters would cost about $0.67B.

* 6,000 AGM-65 Mavericks would cost about $0.66B.

* A new airbase at Sosbeolseom (connecting it to the shore east of it), with a freight port on the west, six wide parallel runways in each direction to host the MQ-9 Reapers and F-16s, plus storage for the Tomahawk missiles (with at least 2,000 in VLS cells), including fuel, ammo, and part/equipment storage facilities would likely cost about $12B.

So, we're at $59.13B (2.8% of OPs estimated cost for tons of Iron Domes). We've likely already achieved better defense than would have been possible with all of the Iron Domes.

Assuming we have VLS clusters of 100 for the Tomahawks, we could likely launch one missile from each cluster every 5 seconds, and have 2,000 missiles airborne within 8 minutes. They would have about an 8-minute travel time, and can loiter for about 2 hours. Assuming SK is at high alert and already has some drones patrolling, the drones and counter-battery radar (combined with knowledge of expected sites) can be used to guide the Tomahawks and wipe out perhaps 1/3rd of the North Korean artillery.

5% of the MQ-9 Reapers (10 of them) could be airborne continuously when at high readiness to provide targeting data for the Tomahawks, while also being able to deliver their own Hellfire missiles. Assuming relatively high readiness, a second wave of Reapers could be taxiing for take off immediately. Similarly, on-duty pilots might be required to complete pre-flight checks then remain suited up at a barracks near the hangars, so we could expect that the first F-16s could be taxiing for take off within 5 minutes.

With six parallel runways (and taxiways to accommodate that level of traffic), and assuming the aircraft take off at a rate of 1 every 30 seconds for each runway with no more than 2 minutes of taxiing time for the first Reapers and F-16s, we could have a wave of 60 Reapers airborne when the first F-16s are ready to take off, 7 minutes into the start of the conflict, and these would arrive in about 23 minutes.

Assuming 150 of the 200 F-16s are committed to the fight initially, the first ones might be taking off within the first seven minutes, all could be airborne within the first 20 minutes, and the first ones would be arriving within 12 minutes after the start of the fight. After they've taken off, another 80 Reapers could take off.

This massive initial wave could quickly obliterate any exposed NK artillery to buy time for SK civilians to evacuate or reach bunkers while the rest of the SK military is brought into the fight. The bunker busters would allow the SK airforce to whittle down the NK artillery even if it tries to hide. Cruise missiles could be loitered over the area for an hour and then diverted to a strategic target if no targets warrant their use. Subsequent (smaller) waves of cruise missiles could be employed in a similar manner for a couple days while the bunker busters are delivered to any lingering targets.

With this arrangement, SK only needs the Iron Dome to hold up for roughly the first hour of fighting, and we can assume the NK artillery would only be able to fire at 1/3rd of OPs rate (his Nautilus article cites an expectation that the NK artillery would alternate between attacking and hiding, with 1/3rd of their time spent attacking). Further, less than 1/2 of that is actually likely, since any exposed artillery will be quickly wiped out over the first hour with the initial wave of cruise missiles, F-16s, and Reapers. So, we would expect 6000x80*0.333*0.5 = 80,000 projectiles to intercept. To do that, we would need 4K Iron Domes, which would be $200B, for a total cost of about $259.13B, or 12% of OP's stated cost. This would also achieve 90% interception instead of OP's 22.5% interception, so we might expect their 6,000 artillery pieces to successfully land just 8,000 shells before they are destroyed.

TL;DR: It's way cheaper to buy the equipment to rapidly wipe out the NK artillery instead of trying to wipe out incoming projectiles. If you can wipe out the NK artillery quickly, then destroying the incoming shells can also be done considerably more cost-effectively.",0c10d0eef34fd1bddc1e19b0d250445b62e5a743,True,False,,,,,0,1650604252,,0,{},i5ppi4f,False,t3_u8pddt,False,True,t1_i5nvit6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8pddt/why_ringing_seoul_with_iron_domes_to_deflect_a/i5ppi4f/,1650604267,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650575452.0

I never said to get rid of our carriers or that they're obsolete or anything like that.  So don't act like I did.  Although ASBMs beat carriers straight up, carriers are still incredibly useful for other things.  There's no better platform for beating up on smaller nations and projecting soft power across the globe than a carrier.  China realizes these advantages and that's why they're building carriers themselves.  It also sure as hell doesn't hurt that they now have the biggest shipbuilding industry the world has ever seen, so why not build up your naval forces with such a capability?  China's desire to own carriers has nothing to do with thinking they're survivable against ASBMs, which I'm sure they realize better than anybody that they're not.  

You dig some holes in the ground.  It's not that hard or that expensive to protect a ballistic missile, especially when you have a land mass the size of China to hide them in.  

Sensor delivery systems are not a new capability and it's one that's increasing in maturity and prevalence as each year passes. 

Sure they can kill them if they can find them and have the proper weapon to do it.  That may be much harder than you think as sensor technology continues to advance.  High altitude balloons can fly above the service ceiling of the vast majority of missiles.  There's all sorts of crafty things you can do with seaborne or underwater sensors that makes them next to impossible to detect until they're needed.  

Anti-missile systems require a killchain that's nearly impossible to pull off, yet at great expense the Navy has found a way to do it against what they consider a reasonable threat.  The problem is what they consider a reasonable threat is really quite tame, especially compared to the resources a country like China could pull off if they had the willpower to.  I doubt the Navy considered the possibility of thousands of ballistic missiles with dispersed sensor technology when designing their anti-missile systems, but it's something the Chinese could pull off quite easily if they really wanted to.",ca63df54df52153c3eeb591bb84c2e5c2f652605,True,False,,,,,0,1650599144,,0,{},i5pgri2,False,t3_u7y0e3,False,True,t1_i5ob6ks,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7y0e3/carrier_killer_chinas_antiship_ballistic_missiles/i5pgri2/,1650599155,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650570344.0

Iran doesn't have known nuclear weapons. Israeli makes regular incursions into the Iranian weapons program.

[],False,,Dragon029,,,[],,,,text,t2_4wca3,False,True,"&gt;IIRC, it also rapidly ate up the airframe's weight for max takeoff/max airborne weight on top of the issues found elsewhere in test

426 gal tanks are only ~3000lb each; the inner wing pylons on the F-35 are rated for 5000lb and the jet's 70,000lb MTOW allows for about 22,500lb of total payload.

&gt;They absolutely flew with GBU-31s on the wings, even during SDD - it was absolutely tested, as were other heavier loads on the wings. So it wasn't a preemptive schedule/cost &amp; utility thing, or they never would have even tried multiple test events on multiple airframes to do it.

They also perform static tests with CBU-105s, etc; doesn't mean that they were working towards certifying them for Block 3F (rather I'm pretty sure they were being used as generic masses for flutter, loads, etc testing). [This slide](https://i.insider.com/553ef79c6da811fc03fbe2e6?width=1000&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp) you linked earlier for example is from the early 2010s; with a program as problematic as the JSF program they weren't going to try and expand the scope of weapons certification mid-SDD.

&gt;The GBU-12 is easily one of the last choices of weapon to use for CAS. If they really cared focused on CAS, they would have integrated the GBU-54 LJDAM, which more or less replaced any GBU-12 usage during the 2010s by US aircraft. 

That mainly just comes down to the timing and bureaucracy side of things; GBU-54 had barely entered production (and hadn't seen operational use) when F-35 SDD began and GBU-49 was selected to augment the GBU-12 later in SDD because it could be certified rapidly owing to its near-identical separation physics. As it is, GBU-38/54 are in the process of being certified for all 3 variants, with the process expected to be finished this year.

&gt;This is the first time they've acknowledged that it, but TR3 is running into problems, according to SECAF:

I'd be surprised if they didn't run into issues, but any issues that they run into with TR3 is just going to be with software; the hardware itself will be a big jump from TR2, but ultimately they're still using quite mature technology like with most military avionics programs. In that respect you can expect TR3 to be delivered more or less on schedule, but just for there to be stories about software instability / bugs aking to when they went from TR1 to TR2 with Block 3i - back then it took them something like 6 months to correct those issues; short enough that it didn't delay USAF F-35A IOC, but long enough that it was close to doing so.

&gt;Also, don't forget that there are other non-TR3 hardware mods they've talked about pursuing: modifications for aft heavy weapons, and they've only started exploring what they need to do if they want to go with Sidekick, which may require further modifications. 

I can't really see Sidekick requiring any modifications beyond the aft-heavy weapons bay mod; it's ultimately just an adapter akin to the LAU-105, but in ejector rather than rail form. That bay modification is included with Lot 15 alongside TR3.

&gt;Like I've said before - what did they find from during those DT flights?

&gt;The question is, what issues did they find?

As per the DOT&amp;E; nothing that would preclude heavier external payloads.

&gt;F-16 Replacement may or may not happen, so it'd be hard to hedge your bets on an airframe with a program that is still up for discussion, especially if you're worried about having airframes in case events kick off in the 2023-2028 timeframe.

For the air policing / CONUS air patrol role, why not just stick to F-16s?

&gt;The B-52's only been seen carrying their hypersonic weapon tests on the pylons. Maybe they'll only carry a single one of those on the centerline of the F-15EX, but that's still potentially 100+ more aircraft that can carry them.

Fair point, though FWIW the USAF was seeking improved pylons for the B-52s to allow them to carry multiple heavy munitions per pylon (20,000lb vs 5,000lb). I suppose though the key question though is what the doctrine regarding those sorts of weapons will be 15 years from now; what kind of inventory the USAF would hold of them and at what kind of rate would it hope to employ them. It does also depend on what shape they end up taking operationally; if they're &lt;5000lb you should theoretically be able to load them onto F-35As or other platforms for a lower cost.",04aca122267f699c178e2cdfe0213ec8dea052d7,True,False,,,,,0,1650592577,,0,{},i5p3azd,False,t3_u7g1m9,False,True,t1_i5ho8sv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7g1m9/air_forces_math_on_the_f15ex_and_f35_doesnt_add_up/i5p3azd/,1650592590,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650563777.0

Robert M. Citino is an American military historian and the Samuel Zemurray Stone Senior Historian at the National WWII Museum. He is a leading authority on modern German military history, with an emphasis upon World War II and the German influence upon modern operational doctrine.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Citino

------------------------

There is a lot of information packed into this talk, it is obvious that Dr Citino has done a lot of research and he is bursting with interesting facts.

For many years I believed in many of the myths he addresses here, like the idea that the Wehrmacht was innocent of the worst warcrimes. Or that the generals in the German were reluctant professionals doing their duty for love of country. 

------------

Some of the interesting tidbits:

* Memoirs written by the former Wehrmacht officer corps, highly trained professionals, denying that they had ever supported Hitler. The memoirs were highly self serving and factually false when you look at the evidence. 

* The West tended to believe the highly skilled generals in their memoirs, as they were well spoken and educated. 

* The Prussian strategic thinking largely informed the opinions of the German military, a war of movement to defeat larger enemies.

* There was very little strategic planning for a long war, the wars were expected to be won quickly.

* In their minds the German officers were refighting WW1. 

* The myth of the clean Wehrmacht, is false. They participated in war crimes. 

* The officer corps was a social elite. And they feared loss of this status.

* The holocaust could not have happened without the administrative support of the Wehrmacht.

* There was no strategic reason to keep fighting in the last year of the war.

* They claim they fought to the end because they had taken an oath, but they had also taken an oath to the Weimar Republic, and more.

* The middle managers or colonels in the German army were the ones who tried to kill Hitler, not the General corps.

* The officer corps supported the rearmament of Germany in the 1930s, the invasion of Poland, France, and the Soviet Union. 

* Memoirs written by the former Wehrmacht officer corps, highly trained professionals, denying that they had ever supported Hitler. The memoirs were highly self serving and factually false when you look at the evidence. 

* Four Reasons for fighting until the end:

1. Fear of Soviet revenge. 
2. Allied declaration to win unconditional surrender, unusual in war
3. Hitler was bribing the officers to the hilt. Pure greed. The equivalent of millions of dollars, and massive estates.
4. The memory of WWI and the myth of losing because of being stabbed in the back from the German home front

* None of the Generals said they went along to the end because they were afraid. Hitler killed very few generals.

* German generals were more likely to fight and die on the front, as opposed to American generals were more likely to be administrators. 

* There was a general Ferdinand Schörner who was very aggressive in executing anyone seen standing around. So much so he became famous for it. He had to be protected by the Soviets in prison from his own men.

* Interrogated after the war, Schörner emphatically stated that they invaded the Soviet Union to forestall a Soviet attack, that Barbarossa was a preventive act.

No? Considering the recent news about how recent sanctions have disrupted Russian arms production because it was still reliant on Western components, it seems like Russia could have had continued access even _if_ Ukraine had been in NATO.

&gt; they assumed that it they did nothing in the face of Yanukovich's deposition, Ukraine might be fast tracked into the EU and NATO, which would result in their supply chain becoming vulnerable as well.

Maybe they did assume it, but it's not really a very good assumption. There was and still is no short-term prospect of Ukraine (or Georgia for that matter) joining NATO. The chances of joining the EU are in the short-term even lower--one does not simply join the EU, there are a variety of economic, political, and other conditions that Ukraine would have had to fulfill before being able to join.
