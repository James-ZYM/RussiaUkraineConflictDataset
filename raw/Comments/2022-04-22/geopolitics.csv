That hasnt been confirmed and Ukraine and the west denied it. Even if the tanks didnt arrive to the frontline yet, it doesnt make a difference. Its clear that Russians didnt interdict them, so now Ukraine has few more tank battalions, that will have to be destroyed in the field. 

&gt;The opposite is true. As the Ukrainian army is whittled down, it becomes easier to divert resources to attend to incoming arms supplies.

Russian army is also getting whittled down. The difference is, that Ukraine is getting a lot of military aid, and the amount is increasing each day, while Russia is slowly running out of stuff. You see, while western military industrial complex is making more military equipment 24/7, Russian for the most part stopped its production because of the sanctions. The other thing is, that Ukraine has declared a mobilization and has so far mobilized hundreds of thousands of men. With each passing day they are fielding more and more military units equipped with equipment from the west. Russia hasnt declared mobilization and once it does, it will take long time for the effects of mobilization to be felt on the ground.

This isnt based on reality. So far, the arms supplies have increased day by day. Today, you have countries like France, USA, Canada, Netherlands etc. publicly declare their intent of sending artillery and much more. USA is seinding more and more drones. You gotta realize that this is basically wet dream of western military industrial complex. Expecting military aid to dwindle is just delusional, no offense. Way too many people make too much money on it. 

Russia basically has 3 options, retreat, which means submission since no way sanctions are gonna go away until they retreat from Belarus, Transnistria, South Ossetia, Syria etc. as well.

[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,,,,"There is yet another element of statescraft that the US has lost and, in fact, I believe it to be one of the most crucial elements: It is losing the ideological clout behind what people understand as ""Western liberal democracies"". Just like companies have visions and unique value propositions, the US had simple, clear narratives that resonated with people: ""land of the free"", ""the American dream"", ""a government of the people, by the people and for the people"". What's left of that?

1) We went from ""free trade is a pillar of development, economic growth and integration; and the free market will take care of disbalances on its own"" to ""it is our duty to control commerce and isolate who we don't agree with, for whatever reasons"". This is The Economist telling us how it is good for governments to establish trade controls (!) - https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vszlmZef_3sJ:https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/03/19/confronting-russia-shows-the-tension-between-free-trade-and-freedom

And we can't say it is just because of the war in Ukraine, before that we had the nightmare that came after Covid with Trump announcing trade restrictions to Canada over N95 masks, and trade sanctions against China.

2) We went from ""the US and the USD are the safest heavens for your investment"" to ""we will dump trillions of inflationary dollars out there and everyone will pay the cost of our economic recovery, weaponize the banking system and take your foreign reserves if you step out of the line"". 

Take for instance Venezuela, the control of many Venezuelan companies as well as its gold reserves were given to Guaidó, the supposed legitimate president of the country which a couple of years later not even the EU recognized anymore due to his incompetence and the numerous corruption scandals that mired his tenure. And we ask: That was for what? The US has recently started negotiating with Maduro again for oil after the ware in Ukraine. Everyone can safely assume that whatever his government was accused of wasn't as bad as to not try to resume relations and economic agreements and the sanctions and reserves-grabbing was simply opportunistic thievery at best. 

The US has tarnished its image a trustworthy financial partner and the dollar as a risk-free reserve currency and I'm willing to bet that many countries are looking to diversify their positions and dump a bunch of USDs.

3) Speaking of Venezuela, it 2004 they approved the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television (Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio y Televisión). See for instance https://www.jstor.org/stable/43133657 to see how it was widely critizised for running ""contrary to the trend throughout Latin America of liberalizing press laws and widening space for debate and editorial opinion"". 

Now there's people decrying Elon Musk's bid to buy out Twitter because it would counter certain censorship measures that are necessary for the correct functioning of democracy (l've read that exact argument being stated by Western commentators - something that would have perfectly come out of Chavez's mouth).Then of course, there's the entire Julian Assange issue that couldn't counter more the idea of liberal press laws and the space for editorial opinion. 

4) Also, we went from the US is the ideal of democracy throughout the world to being bombarded with a clown fest of an actual coup in Washington DC, people instigating insurrections, accusations of election fraud from all over which have followed systematic efforts to disenfranchise voters, nationwide protests and police brutality, a partisan legislative body that appoint life-long partisan judges to subvert long-standing legal traditions, and much more. 

People are not dumb, and areound the world they ask questions like ""how are these guys supposed to brind democracy to anyone?"" Again from The Economist, see how they report on the democratic ideals from the perspective of Asian countries - https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Sr1v-X_fiz8J:https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/23/interests-not-values-underpin-asias-ambivalence-about-russia+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=co

5) And finally there's the idea of the American Dream and the land of opportunities.: From the demonization of immigrants - even hard-working ones to the many structural problems with home ownership, living wages and working conditions, inflation, debt, poverty and wealth inequality, deteriorating health indicatores, etc. I honestly think those ideas are slowly becoming fantasies of the past.

You're right, it would have been more accurate to say ""the US"" instead of ""the west"" since Europe is not that concerned about China. Then again, Europe has a way of letting the US to drag it into all sorts of international conflicts that it has no interest in.

&gt;The West is not threatening India at all.

It's been threatening vague ""consequences"" for siding with Russia, and only backed down once it became clear that India wasn't listening to their threats.

&gt;the biggest threat to China is a unified European and US front.

Europe hasn't been a real threat to China in decades, and now that Europe is laser-focused on opposing Russia, they'll be even less of a threat to China. Or do you think they'll choose to send their troops to China when they have a newly-belligerent Russia waiting right on their doorstep?

&gt;That's how alliances work. You take some pain in exchange for strengthening the alliance that long term benefits you.

In a good alliance, both sides are willing to take on some sacrifices for the sake of their partner. You're pointing out that India has shown itself unwilling to take on certain sacrifices for the sake of the west, but what about the west? When have they ever shown themselves willing to take on any sacrifices for the sake of India? And if the west isn't willing to make such sacrifices, why should India do so? This is the question you're avoiding, preferring instead to pin the whole blame on India. If the west wants India to make this sacrifice to help them out, it should offer up a sacrifice of its own to help India. They could, for instance, guarantee that they'll side with India against Pakistan if India sides with the west against Russia, or make some other offer to help India out, but they've made no such offer.",92744bdd4f5170d512175f23e98d8c195b25e4fc,True,False,,,,,0,1650654658,,0,{},i5sb9ba,False,t3_u8meu9,False,False,t1_i5s7004,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8meu9/washingtons_clumsy_attempts_to_bully_india_must/i5sb9ba/,1650654669,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650625858.0,[],text,t2_q2rnh4c,False,False

If China were to become dominant India can not trust that China will not blockade India, just as China does not trust the states. No nation would ever trust control of its sea lanes to a foreign power.

France claims it has drone footage (unreleased) that shows alleged Russian Wagner mercs manipulating corpses in such a way and position as to implicate French troops as having committed a massacre in the course of their recent and ongoing withdrawal from the country. France announced their withdrawal from Mali in February, after a failed 9-year effort to stabilize the situation. These efforts were characterized by French and Malian forces failure to achieve decisive victories against jihadi bandits active in the country, growing popular anti-French sentiment in Mali and the greater Sahel region, and French frustration with Malian political instability. The most recent in a string of military coups was in May 2021. 

The same junta which came to power in that coup has embraced Russia and shunned France: not only blaming the French for their real failures, but even accusing them of being complicit in jihadi atrocities. This new diplomatic status quo entered a new stage in December 2021, when Russian mercenaries from the infamous Wagner Group allegedly began operations in the country. Although largely playing the same role as the French had - namely, assisting Malian regular operations against jihadi forces - the broader geopolitical goals and implications are obviously part of the increasing tensions between Europe and Russia. With the sharp ratcheting up of these same tensions caused by the invasion of Ukraine, this most recent event likely marks a trend of diplomatic and public-relations/informational warfare between Europe and Russia extending abroad out of the European continent and into the post-colonial world.

I'm not sure what did you mean by ''in the 21th century European culture shifted from absolute monarchy to capitalist liberal democracy to socialist dictatorship''? All western European absolute monarchies ended around the first quarter of the 20th century. The european Dictatorships such as Mussolini's fascism, Hitler's nazism and the like, were predicted by Spengler, who referred to them as Caesarism. It is a reaction against the politics driven by moneyed interests, where people turn to a strong authority in hopes of abolishing Democracy, which Spengler sees as the age of absolute power of money. Of course, european caesarism was overthrown. But it was overthrown by American imperialism itself, which is itself shifting towards Caesarism. In this Spengler was right yet again. He had correctly announced that since the 1800's, starting with Napoleon, the West had started its own ''Contending States'' period, where the different Faustian states would wage increasingly devastating  wars for power. Because the Faustian prime symbol was that of boundless space its imperialism had reached the whole world, unlike Egyptian, Chinese or Babylonian imperialism.

This period ended in 1945, when just as Rome took over Greece around the battle of Actium (31 BCE) ushering in the longest period of Greek peace at the expense of its own culture which was already exhausted as it had already accomplished the sum of its possibilities, an strengthened United States took over Europe and turned it into its protectorate ushering in the longest period of European peace at the expense of its own culture which is already exhausted as it has already accomplished the sum of its possibilities.

I think you're asking what I suppose is the problem with California. Is that right?
I am a socialist with certain anarchist leanings. I see California as the problem with moderates who are culturally liberal. In essence, California is the modern democratic party boiled down. Texas is the modern Republican party boiled down. Neither seems like a good route for the United States. Texas takes away civil rights and doesn't do public infrastructure and increasingly make steps towards becoming an apartheid state. Meanwhile California wastes money, continues to pollute, continues to be natural resource dependent and not take care of its people. Both states have huge prison populations. They are just mismanaged in different ways. If I had to pick one to live in I would choose California, but I don't like either one of them. And that's the choice I get every federal election.

2. Source? I think Zelesnkyy simply pointed out that if Ukraine hadn't of given up its nuclear weapons in the early 90s, Russia would not have invaded them, which is probably true. Russia signed a treaty (the Budapest Memorandum) along with the US and UK, which promised to respect Ukraine's borders and sovereignty in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. Russia broke that promise in 1994. Any treaty signed with Russia isn't worth the paper its written on. 
3. Gorbachev received verbal assurances from western leaders that NATO wouldn't expand into East Germany and Eastern Europe when the Berlin Wall came down. There was nothing legally binding about this, and these assurances were made when the USSR still existed and still occupied much of Eastern Europe. In my opinion, the Russians had very different expectations of what would happen when the USSR collapsed. The Russians thought that the end of the Cold War would mean that NATO would be dissolved and that there would be some new security framework that united Europe and gave Russia special privileges in Eastern Europe. The West however saw the Cold War as a victory and encountered an Eastern Europe that was eager to join in the economic prosperity of the West, and gain protection from a resurgent Russia. It was always going to be hard to balance the interests of Eastern European countries while not excluding the Russians. This does not justify invading other nations (not just Ukraine, also Moldova and Georgia). You don't start wars because of verbal agreements made over a decade before most of the soldiers fighting were even born.
4. What evidence is there that Euromaidan was a coup? The Euromaidan was a constitutional crisis where Yanukovych was forced to resign because of the killing of protestors. There was no constitutional provision of the situation and so the parliament installed a new government which just happened not to be so friendly towards Russia. And in case you haven't noticed, the Poroshenkov government isn't in power any more. Ukraine has competitive elections. Russia's invasion of the Crimea actually made this situation worse for Russia, because a lot of pro-Russian Ukrainians lived in Crimea, and obviously Ukrainians weren't happy about Russia invading and stealing Ukrainian land.

A couple of considerations:

1) Ethnic Russians have been under attack for the past 8 years in the Donbas, and there's every indication that the Ukrainian force that is currently encircled there was poised to launch a decisive strike against the DPR and LPR when the Russians intervened. Some consider this community to be victims of genocide, but regardless, a war has been waging there for 8 years and the Ukrainians have refused to implement terms of the Minsk agreement to bring its cessation.

2) The Zelenskyy regime has been vocal about it's desire to nuclearise.

3) NATO Eastward expansion is in violation of prior agreements and is perceived as a direct threat to Russian national security. There is ample precedent of nations waging pre-emptive strikes when they construe an imminent threat, and there is some debate as to whether this may be justified under UN charter.

Demonstrably false. Casualties includes wounded, of which the US had 20,000+ and that aside, the total coalition in Afghanistan suffered 73000+ killed and that was against a third world enemy without any air defence or air power. Additionally, we have no reliable casualty figures to judge anything with at this stage and all the claims of the Western Media are heavily based on Ukrainian sources, who frankly, have zero credibility at this stage.

The Ukrainians have the second largest military in Europe. They are trained and equipped to NATO standards. The US hasn't fought a comparatively powerful foe since WW2 so all contemporary comparisons are null and void.

Economically it was in a similar position vs the US as China (the USSR was richer in per capita terms compared to the US, but at its peak relatively similar in total GDP compared to the US). You have to remember China is dirt poor--about as rich per capita as Russia is right now after all the sanctions, and about 1/6th as rich as America per person.

Howeved the USSR had a large amount of sattelite states that acted as extensions of itself. When you take these into account, even at the USSRs low point in the late 80s, it was in an economically similar position as China is now. This excludes real allies as well, of which it had far more than China. That isn't saying much, because China allies are just Cambodia, Laos, and kind of North Korea. This is important, because thats really what makes China a regional instead of world power--its influence does not extend past its borders and in any conflict it would be alone.

Militarily, there was a technological gap between the USSR and the US, but China has yet to even reach soviet technological standards in many sectors--their jets are dreadfully bad, and presumably that applies to everything else outside of maybe electronics. The Soviets also sought to make up for the technological gap with absurd volume, and they definitely achieved it. China has neither quantity nor quality. You can find videos and pictures online of Chinese RPG tubes melting after being fired, or hatches on ships installed backwards so that the the force of waves break them open into the ship. Theres some really absurd stuff.

So yeah, China on its own is in a similar position to the USSR--very poor in capita terms, but about half to 2/3rds of Americas total--but its situatiln as a whole is much bleaker.",cefdc2688e668affaa2b5d74e79995225a5fbe77,True,False,,,,,0,1650586121,,0,{},i5opfis,False,t3_u8nqc8,False,True,t1_i5o9xf4,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8nqc8/the_return_of_statecraft_back_to_basics_in_the/i5opfis/,1650586139,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650557321.0,[],text,t2_7xldm,False,False
