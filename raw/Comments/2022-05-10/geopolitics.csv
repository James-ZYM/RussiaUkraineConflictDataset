They have these ICBMs as a deterrent against the US/NATO/West and perhaps even China from ever invading them and toppling the Kim regime. Also, whenever they are unhappy about something, they conduct some missile tests to threaten the West and remind everyone that they still have their nukes.

It would be beyond foolish for North Korea to launch their nuclear missiles and attack any other country. The whole purpose of the nukes is to prevent others from attacking them. If they were to ever use the nukes themselves in a first-strike situation, then they'd be met with far more nukes fired back as retaliation by the US, the UK, France etc.

The US and all the other nuclear-weapon-holding nations have far more nukes than North Korea. It would be disastrous for any nation to launch as strike on North Korea.

While it took me some time to process and separate my emotional responses from being accused of not being topical and disagreeing with some overgeneralizing on the extent of US's peaceable involvement in the world after Vietnam, I appreciated the explanation and examples you provided that distinguished between a few situations in line with what I was asking.

The content you shared in example about the choices made for prioritizing military targets vs. using nuclear weapons was helpful and actually addressed what I wanted help with being able to understand in my question to OP to an extent.

I think there's a few dimensions for analysis that I've/we've yet to find common language and understanding on still, like for me the legacy of impact on nonmilitary populations even if the targets were arguably military.

For example, attacking nuclear facilities in Ukraine seems like it can be categorized as scorched earth just as using heavy metal herbicides and firebombing in Vietnam--albeit on different orders of magnitude but both have lasting. 

From an amateur peace and conflict studies point of view I'm willing to imagine there's something meaningful that can be garnered by looking at those situations with different paradigms and language even if the answers don't come up on a Reddit thread, but if they do that's good too and at the least it helped me to see how others look at and describe complex conflicts by realizing that my best efforts to explain my own perspective probably didn't work to the ends I had hoped as well.",f11620282a19c792f35a1ffc94ee79c21742499f,True,False,,,,,0,1652205823,,0,{},i82vjra,False,t3_uki6bq,False,True,t1_i7xqshh,/r/geopolitics/comments/uki6bq/arent_heavy_losses_typical_for_nearpeer_conflicts/i82vjra/,1652205836,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652177023.0,

I don’t know what the hell is going on at the Hill, I had my doubts about their reputation before reading this article, but after reading this article, I have no doubt that they are straight up pro-Russian propaganda. Let me break it down for you.         
This is the press release from OHCHR the Hill is referencing: [Plight of civilians in Ukraine](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2022/05/plight-civilians-ukraine). Please read it. It focuses on war crimes committed against the Ukrainian population. It talks about indiscriminate killing of civilians. It talks about rapes and gang rapes. It talks about civilians being forcefully transported to Belarus. It talks about personal tragedies of people in some detail.           
And then towards the end it has this blurb:           
&gt; We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by Ukrainian Armed Forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. We continue to see the publication of videos, which show inhumane treatment, including prisoners from both sides being coerced to make statements, apologies and confessions, and other forms of humiliation. This violates fundamental rules of international humanitarian law.         

The press release doesn’t go into detail what that information is and doesn’t elaborate on the treatment of soldiers. It’s a rather dry, generalized and vague  statement. The main focus is civilian suffering, which comprises something like 90% of the press release.           
I have no idea how does a Hill reporter read through the release, gets to the last paragraph and walks away with a headline about “UN receiving ‘credible’ information about Ukrainian troops torturing Russian prisoners” unless they went in looking for that headline. Once again, to make it clear, **the UN press release is about civilians and their suffering with some terrible details reported**.

The over-valuation of real-estate in a shrinking population has to end sometime.  A great deal of the ‘growth’ China has experienced in the last thirty years has been from massive infrastructure over-building which can’t continue forever and the bills must be paid.  The PLA and PLAN are massive black holes of corruption, that has not been battle-tested since the 1979 debacle in Vietnam.  This is an armed forces that is meant to, at times, intimidate, and other times suppress the local population.
“the China/Taiwan 9 dash line”
This is something that does not exist.  There is only the Chinese 9 dash Line and that is only recognized by them.  No neighbouring countries recognize it.

Why on earth would China ‘protect’ Taiwanese companies when they could do the same for their own?  Every major corporation in China is that way because of preferential treatment ( read ‘kickbacks’).
“It would also depend on what the PRC is willing to concede,”
Nothing.  They conceded nothing to the people of Hong Kong even after vowing to.  They make promises and then take what they want.  That has been made abundantly clear.
“…pledge for…”. Ask the people of Hong Kong about ‘pledges’ from China. 
“Either way the idea that at any moment everything in your life could change and everything you worked for goes boom, is a very scary prospect in the back of the heads of every Taiwanese”
Not true.  The vast majority of Taiwanese rarely think about this and when they do, something around 97% desire for either the status quo ( de facto independence) or an outright declaration of independence.  “the suffering caused by even a failed invasion”

2) There is a large divergence politically. It would be unusual, to say the least, for a society to voluntarily give up a relatively free society and replace it with a remote authoritarian state.

3) Economically, while China is, on an absolute basis, large, it is on a per capita basis not very wealthy.

On top of that, Taiwanese firms and people are already well integrated into global trade and gets everything they need internationally and has nearly no dependence on China for basic resources. 

4) Lack of shared societal values and outlook. Although very different, it probably isn't stretching it to say that the Taiwanese share an outlook closer to Japan and S Korea rather than the China of today. It is more likely that the average Taiwanese considers China to be backwards and undeveloped - perhaps a quaint tourist destination rather than a society to be emulated.

Let's say China is the undisputed Global power. 

China invades or absorbs Taiwan:

There is no scenario with China as above the USA in military projection and economic might that China does not have Taiwan. It would be firmly under the CCP's grasp by outright, bloody invasion or straggling it economically and using dark arts. 

Chinese RMB would be the preferred Global transaction currency: 

This would mean the dollar was 2nd or worse. In the worse case, that would be Bitcoin(Or Gold based)  overtaking the dollar, while China created an authoritarian digital currency sphere using digital yan for materials purchases in exchange for projects.  While other countries are on bitcoin, gold or another standard but still need RMB due to industrial purchases.  

Without the reserve:

 The US would go bankrupt and a left or right wing nationalist revolution would occur.  

China would then choose to engage politically and form new international institutions instead of the World Bank or IMF and quickly try to form alliances broadly with Most of Africa, All of Asia except Japan.  Maybe 1-3 Countries in the America's, Russia, Iran, Pakistan 

Geographical Power

The new world order would be based on national dictatorships. Chinese would produce even cheaper and more affordable smartphones and global internet access.  China controls all major social media companies and a vast majority of the internet uses Chinese platforms.  

 Each phone would be monitored with scaled out tech learned from their own population and governments would receive live updates in exchange for continued digital/traditional rmb purchases.  

Governments would active revolutions under their umbrella would receive kill/capture orders and training special forces teams would operate around the world ready to deploy. 

Wide spread revolts would happen throughout Africa and Asia in particular fueled by overt and covert US weapons sales and transfers.  China would respond with massive drone strikes.  

Revolts continue, countries with large strategic reserves would receive Chinese Battalions and air assets would use massive, targeted fire power against populations resisting, each continued action would receive more massive firepower Most nations would back down, a few would go into total revolt and lose millions to become independent.   

Europe would side with China.

But for what it's worth the majority of hardcore Ukrainian nationalism is Banderite nationalism. Bandera was a Nazi who believed Ukrainians were ethnically pure, while Jews, Russians and poles were untermensch. The Ukrainian halocaust led by Bandera was one of the most brutal halocausts - 1 million Jews and 300k poles were killed through firing squads (even the ss had to use gas chambers). 

The current Ukrainian nationalist movement or the Nazis as Putin calls them are Banderites. The ""brave Azov defenders of Mariupol"" as western media likes to say are an explicitly neo Nazi battalion who use the literal SS logo as their insignia. The post maidan Ukrainian governments have constructed statues of Bandera and gave him the hero of ukraine medal, naming countless streets after him.

If you look at the war in Donbass, from 2014-2017, the war was composed of exclusively neo Nazi battalions who viewed the Russian speaking east as trash. President poreshenko himself said Donbass children should rot in their basements. 

The CIA tried to fund these Nazis to mess up Stalin in the late 40s but quit because it was deemed impossible.

HW bush was concerned about the nukes getting in the hands of these lunatics as well as broader implications of Soviet collapse.

When? Al-Qaeda didn't even exist until 1988, and I can't find any reporting indicating that bin Laden or his followers received CIA support. Most money for the Mujahideen went through Pakistan's intelligence service, and it was not really given to foreign fighters (bin Laden was Arab of course). Some of the Afghans may have funded them with this money, but at the time bin Laden was still independently wealthy.

&gt;us finances and trained the taliban.

Same question. 

Some members of the Taliban received training from the US during the Soviet occupation, but the Taliban itself did not form until 1994, well after the US had stopped being involved. When they took control of Afghanistan in 1996 they were widely condemned by the international community for many of the same reasons that they are widely condemned now.

&gt; It then turned sour, so they used it as a pretext for invasions.

That skips so many important details. The US never wanted to invade Afghanistan, mostly for all of the reasons that became apparent after it did invade. The Taliban were already hated internationally well before 9/11, and the UN had spent a great deal of time condemning and sanctioning them. There didn't need to be any further pretext if it was just about invading.

What the US did wrong in 1989 was not helping Afghanistan put their country back together after the Soviets left. Now to be fair to the US, events in Europe were far more important to its geopolitics, so it isn't surprising that the situation went ignored.

There was never any plan for further intervention though. They were probably hoping that Pakistani ISI would sort the situation out, but of course that turned out to be a massive miscalculation. The US always knew that invading Afghanistan was a dumb idea. 9/11 changed the politics of the US radically.",99ef7fd89ce67003f271d27dc9bfdcd316a7feed,True,False,,,,,0,1652148033,,0,{},i7zz3nz,False,t3_ulv9vk,False,True,t1_i7z0lnr,/r/geopolitics/comments/ulv9vk/our_soldiers_are_defending_our_motherland_in/i7zz3nz/,1652148045,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652119233.0,

But unless you have compared Russia in the 90s to Russia in 2000s and 2010s, you really can't say anything. The difference is shocking. Talk to normal cold War Europeans who visited Russia - most of them are shocked to see a relatively normal country when they go. Or better yet talk to actual Russians, many of whom had to use their garden potatoes while the western liberals cheered on McDonald's in Moscow. 

Literally look at any statistic - life expectancy, violence, nutrition, death rate, GDP per capita and compare how it changed from 80s to the horror of the 90s to Putin. It's really not shocking why he's liked - any strongman that pulls his country out of am oligarchal mafia state into a relatively normal country is well liked.

I think there's probably a chance technical differences exist in the eyes of someone who studied military history as part of their job hence I asked a question about it as it sort of fits the picture but also might not given the environmental focus. 

From a layperson's point of view if the paradigm is centered on the impact on the land and civilian noncombatant base, it still fits a sort of scorched earth pattern. 

But at the same time maybe there's something for how military strategy/history gets characterized like whether it was ultimately done to capture/conquer territory or not right? On first impressions, I didn't really have that distinction in mind and maybe that's the answer in itself.

Honestly it's horrifying that that degree of thinking and impact on people can and does exist. But because there's a real pattern in war that affects people who otherwise have nothing to do with the conflict, I can't help but wonder why that kind of action shows up in so many parts of history. 

Sometimes there are surprising common roots to it all like how the bible sets a template for cultural genocide in Deuteronomy, or how the Doctrine of Discovery simultaneously enabled the Church to enslave Africans while establishing aggressive evangelization for Native Americans and anyone else of similar complexion. Russian propaganda and what we see used by Fox News and Sinclair Broadcast Group today played out in similar ways Vietnam before, and in the Russian revolution too.

So to me I genuinely wonder where some of the language and lenses used for these events come from.

We can look to older events in the US like general Sherman razing crops to the ground, or systematically extirpating Buffalo would be considered or described too. 

While those are examples specific to US history, European warfare and colonization probably hasn't been too different if we look closely enough elsewhere (e.g. Operation Trail Dust/Ranch Hand was supposedly inspired by the British and what they were doing in Malaysia; the colonization of Australia probably has valid parallels to what Native Americans experienced too), or if we go back further even salting the earth was a thing with similarly terrible consequences for people who weren't necessarily part of the military conflict.

Chinese prominence still existed after agriculture was introduced to Europe. I mean, for a good chunk of time even after Rome Europe still struggled to catch up in the matters of Chinese metallurgy and chemistry, and if weren’t for the Mongols diffusing gunpowder to Europe(or the Ottomans depending on who you ask) Europe likely would have stayed relatively stagnant for a good period of time.

Even as Europe began its ascent, I’d argue it took until the Great Divergence itself for Europe to come to the forefront of the world. That’s like over a thousand and a half years at least.

While I do agree that the West(and generally areas that have either adopted Western ideals or are Westernized) are at the forefront of technological innovation now, and I’d argue ever since the 18th-19th century, I believe technology relies less on whoever has the inertia and more on whoever can steal it. China is incredibly good at playing a game of catch up with other nations, as we can see by it transforming its economy in basically a generation. The same is more or less true for the other ‘Asian Tigers’, who themselves are now considered to be at the forefront, or at the very least a very advanced position, in the international tech race. At least in my view, the more resources one consumes to develop technology, the less it takes for another country to simply get the designs and steal it, or do something along the lines of reverse-engineering. I wouldn’t personally agree that technology is being developed faster than it takes to catch up to it, though I do see the logic there and I think it’s too much of a subjective point for us to factually come to a conclusion on.

Your point about computer chips I absolutely agree with, though I don’t think it affects my point too much. China is a link in that system but it still is part of it, and I’d argue that it’s prominence in other economic matters all but ensures it will be the new economic center of the world, or at least very influential.

The most important aspect of this in the modern contextual is the design and manufacturing of computer chips. Taiwan, and to a lesser extent China may have the infrastructure needed to manufacture chips at the moment, but their designs are made in the California, and the machines which make the chip-making-machines are produced in the Netherlands. Without these critical components of the process, the economies of east Asia would collapse.",025dce52d102f927671bf5a48dcb8211e38bd7b9,True,False,,,,,0,1652142051,,0,{},i7zlqsi,False,t3_ukqqut,False,True,t1_i7ve45c,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7zlqsi/,1652142065,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652113251.0,

NATO is the military wing of American dominance while the other aspect is economic dominance through capital controls. Russia asked for help from the US during the 90s in which western banks partnered with criminal Russians to help loot Russia and its citizens.

Putin is well liked in Russia for throwing the oligarchs out of politics and ""bringing them to heel"" and ending the ruin of the 90s. The west particularly began to turn on Putin, as an autocrat, when he threw out western oil companies that were speculating on Russian oil fields without producing any oil. Until then, he was the well loved deputy liberal mayor of st Petersburg. 

If you really want to dig deeper search, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. He's paraded around as a journalist and western expert/critic but in reality he was one the most corrupt and sleezy of oligarchic mafia lords (2nd only to Boris Berezovsky a true sleezeball with all sorts of mafia ties including with the Chechens). These oligarchs were exiled from Russia and their assets seized by Putin. It's equivalent of Russia plastering an Italian-American mob family who fled the US when about to be arrested and calling them cultural experts as they plaster them over their propaganda networks.

Putin talks about this a lot and in general matches the broad narrative that the west (or rather the US, referred to as the Anglo Saxons in Russia) wants only weakened puppet states that ascribe to liberal internationalism, who's resources are owned by Anglo American banks. Kind of hard to argue with the point. 

Anyone who doesn't know the sheer degree of misery that was 90s Russia (and Ukraine and many other post Soviet states) should not really comment about Putin and why most Russians support him. For a brief summary, the adult male life expectancy in Russia in 1990s, fell by DOUBLE DIGITS due violence, starvation, and poverty - in ""peacetime"". Also, the rise of Eastern European sex workers in 90s and the collapse of the Soviet Union aren't disconnected.
