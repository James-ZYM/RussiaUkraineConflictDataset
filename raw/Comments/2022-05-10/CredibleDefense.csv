&gt; We continue to receive allegations of rape, including gang rape, attempted rape, forced nudity, threats of sexual violence against civilian women and girls, men and boys. Women and girls are the most frequently cited victims. During my recent visit to towns north of Kyiv, we documented a number of cases of sexual violence. In one town that we visited a woman was raped and killed allegedly by a Russian soldier.  The same soldier then attempted to rape her neighbour. This woman’s husband intervened, but was then shot by the soldier. He later died.

&gt; We also spoke to people who are searching to find their relatives and friends. We documented some cases where Russian armed forces had detained civilians, mostly young men, and transferred them to Belarus and then Russia, where they have been held in pre-trial detention centres. Overall, since 24 February, we have documented **204 cases of enforced disappearance** (169 men, 34 women, 1 boy), the **overwhelming majority of them by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.**",b5f0f978f7f6b6cce25b6d87e8e55165a4af5c39,True,False,,,,,0,1652227083,,0,{},i84am65,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i83uj2f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i84am65/,1652227101,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652198283.0,,

So attacking US sovereign property could be considered an act of war.

From [Article 52 of the Additional Provisions to the Geneva Conventions](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750067):

&gt;1. Civilian objects shall not be the object of attack or of reprisals. Civilian objects are all objects which are not military objectives as defined in paragraph 2.

&gt;2. Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.

I suppose you could argue that StarLink is helping Ukrainians wage war, and that it is a legitimate target.

More interesting analysis:

https://space.nss.org/wp-content/uploads/Space-Manufacturing-conference-12-141-Jus-In-Bello-Spatialis.pdf

&gt;The direct use of force against space
assets of a nation has several implications.
First this can lead to a war of attrition in
outer space which would in tum
exponentially increase the presence of space
debris, a major concern for all satellites be
they civil or military. The militarily
increased space debris would in tum
endanger satellites belonging to neutral
States. We argue that the debris problem
could conceivably be a violation of the
rights of neutral States during international
armed conflicts.

https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-1/VanLoon.pdf

&gt;satellites owned by a private firm or a neutral
state are generally protected by immunity. However, the Hague Convention affirms that neutral states are not required to “forbid or restrict the
use on behalf of the belligerents” of technology used for typically civilian
purposes, such as weather or civilian communications satellites 

https://harvardnsj.org/2012/11/targeting-in-outer-space-legal-aspects-of-operational-military-actions-in-space

&gt;This can be analogized to the classic example of whether a civilian TV station is a legitimate target.[47] Dinstein notes that the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia stated that attacks on TV and Radio stations “could be justified only if the TV and radio transmitters were integrated into the military command and control communications network.”[48]

&gt;A final problem presented by commercial satellites, is whether those registered to neutral parties to a conflict can become valid targets. For instance, if a belligerent is buying imagery from a third party and that party’s satellite is registered to a neutral state, does the third party’s satellite become a valid target. In this instance, the law of neutrality must be examined. “Neutral state[s] must not assist [parties] to the conflict”;[52] this rule includes a duty for neutral states to “prohibit export and transit of war material by private persons for the benefit of one of the parties to the conflict.”[53] However, current opinion juris considers war material to consist of weapons strict sensu.[54] It is doubtful then that remote sensing imagery provided by a commercial vendor would be considered a “war material.”

This author argues that military response to even signal interference can sometimes be justified. https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=ils

&gt;The principles of necessity and proportionality make a response to satellite signal interference particularly challenging because a State may be required to employ a wide array of passive measures prior to resorting to any
forcible course of action. For instance, if non-forcible measures are sufficient to stop the attack, a State may not engage in forcible measures. If,
however, non-forcible measures are inadequate, forcible measures including kinetic operations may be employed, assuming they also conform to the
applicable legal constraints of IHL.",5883337db0754f02f56e6cfbdb5449faaaa8fa8d,True,False,,,,,0,1652224174,,0,{},i844633,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i839zp5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i844633/,1652224191,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652195374.0,,

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"So this is provoking good discussion but the original twitter thread indeed raises a lot of flags.

For starters, there are reports of US batteries having 30 second response time in WW2. Two keys to this were widely distributed high accuracy maps with a common grid reference system, and filing cabinets at the artillery batteries with precomputed tables of firing solutions. This meant anyone with some basic orienteering skills, a map, and a radio could call in a strike if necessary, and that the battery would have a reasonably accurate enough firing solution to fire for effect promptly.

So this kind of turnaround time isn't fundamentally new, or dependent on modern software and technology. So I think the shade the author is throwing at modern US artillery practices is just a totally off the mark narrative. It's RoE and other considerations that dominate this, not some new unique technology.

Then down at the end the author goes off the rails with the ""first Starlink war"" stuff. Major militaries have had suitcase sized SATCOM for a long time now. Starlink is new, shiny, and high bandwidth. It's not a fundamentally new capability.

One other thing I'd say he's getting wrong, but that involves some speculation, is the basic picture he paints for drone targeted artillery. I'd say the screenshots in the thread confirm something I'd suspected for a while based on viral footage: which is that the Ukraine done observers likely have a decent database of aerial/satellite imagery with them on a laptop or tablet, with a UI that lets them estimate coordinates by eye. They don't GPS, laser range finders, or even Starlink. That software on that tablet, plus a radio, would be enough for a forward observer to probably pick which cluster of trees they wanted to hit in a hedge row with enough accuracy to be effective.

So this author is really missing the forest for the trees because they're so interested in pushing this dramatic narrative about a technological revolution, when I think the really cool story here is the Ukrainians have come up with a really simple pragmatic solution that's the modern equivalent of those filing cabinets and maps in WW2.",c895f316ce805925eb175e1d6191aa99a722398d,True,False,,,,,0,1652219626,,0,{},i83tso9,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i82mqdk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i83tso9/,1652219644,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652190826.0,,

What makes you think they can't? Just because they haven't, doesn't mean they can't. European countries have dozens of Mig-29s they could transfer to Ukraine within weeks if anyone thought it was necessary and was willing to. But with Russian AA capabilities and the war being mostly fought via artillery, tanks, and in urban areas there's not really a need for it.  


As for anti-air systems, there aren't many S-300s around anymore among the allies and modern AA like patriots are much too unwieldy and advanced for simply transferring to an active war zone and soldiers who have never used it.   


I don't know where all these people keep getting blatantly wrong information from about the ""west"" and a lack of AA. It seems one person said it and now everyone on reddit is repeating it. There are plenty of systems out there, they just aren't simple enough to simply give away. The patriot system, for instance, is a finicky machine (well machines) that isn't very mobile and typically requires 90 personnel to operate.

Introduction:

&gt; The U.S. has unilaterally committed to not conducting destructive anti-satellite missile tests!

&gt; Jeffrey and Aaron walk through what the U.S. has actually normatively committed to, what this means for potential future attempts at arms control in space, and some of the institutional hurdles the U.S. must overcome for a long-lasting commitment to space-based arms control.

Anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) are space weapons designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic or tactical[1] purposes. Several nations possess operational ASAT systems. Although no ASAT system has yet been utilised in warfare, a few countries (China, India, Russia, and the United States) have successfully shot down their own satellites to demonstrate[2] their ASAT capabilities in a show of force.[3][4] ASATs have also been used to remove decommissioned satellites.[5]

ASAT roles include: defensive measures against an adversary's space-based and nuclear weapons, a force multiplier for a nuclear first strike, a countermeasure against an adversary's anti-ballistic missile defense (ABM), an asymmetric counter to a technologically superior adversary, and a counter-value weapon.[6]

Use of ASATs generates space debris, which can collide with other satellites and generate more space debris.[2] A cascading multiplication of space debris could cause Earth to suffer from Kessler syndrome.

From a financial perspective, no one really wants to give up their good stuff unless Ukraine absolutely needs it. So NATO is unloading its older things because it can afford to and politically that's easiest. NATO most likely can't export things like older patriot systems without the USA's blessing and Biden isn't giving it.

&gt; Jeffrey and Aaron walk through what the U.S. has actually normatively committed to, what this means for potential future attempts at arms control in space, and some of the institutional hurdles the U.S. must overcome for a long-lasting commitment to space-based arms control.

Anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) are space weapons designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic or tactical[1] purposes. Several nations possess operational ASAT systems. Although no ASAT system has yet been utilised in warfare, a few countries (China, India, Russia, and the United States) have successfully shot down their own satellites to demonstrate[2] their ASAT capabilities in a show of force.[3][4] ASATs have also been used to remove decommissioned satellites.[5]

ASAT roles include: defensive measures against an adversary's space-based and nuclear weapons, a force multiplier for a nuclear first strike, a countermeasure against an adversary's anti-ballistic missile defense (ABM), an asymmetric counter to a technologically superior adversary, and a counter-value weapon.[6]

Use of ASATs generates space debris, which can collide with other satellites and generate more space debris.[2] A cascading multiplication of space debris could cause Earth to suffer from Kessler syndrome.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/thebakersinstitute/2022/05/02/us-lng-gaslift-floods-european-terminals-ahead-of-russia-gas-cutoff/?sh=33a1a0a86df3

&gt; * As payments by other countries near their due dates, many ask whether this is the time when Russia may cut its gas deliveries to Europe completely and, if so, what can the U.S. do?

&gt; * Russia has now officially cut off natural gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria. The move was predicated upon the refusal of both countries to pay for their long-contracted gas deliveries in rubles. As payments by other countries near their due dates, many ask whether this is the time when Russia may cut its gas deliveries to Europe completely and, if so, what can the U.S. do? 

&gt; * …most northern European LNG terminals are already running at over 100% capacity (See Figure 1 below) with Poland currently at 117% capacity.

&gt; * The wake-up call started in 2021 when Russia began delivering significantly less gas than usual despite higher-than-average European demand. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine only added to the sense of urgency. In fact, Poland’s advance preparation has enabled it to keep its gas storage at extremely high levels; a staggering 76% at the end of the heating season.

&gt; * Each of them is currently scrambling to ensure possible non-Russian supply from different sources, including installing LNG floating storage and regasification units (FSRU)s by end of this year at their shores and trying to bring in more gas via pipeline from Algeria (in Italy’s case). 

&gt; * …both LNG markets and immediate practical measures can make potential cutoff of Russian gas manageable in the short term; especially now, at the end of the heating season when natural gas demand drops significantly.

&gt; * Since the undelivered Russian gas has nowhere else to go (at least until Russia builds a new pipeline to China),

&gt; * This is the point where some commentators have suggested that the U.S. should become even more actively involved, forcing US LNG suppliers to divert supplies to Europe. The U.S. government should, they argue, employ the Defense Production Act or other legal means to direct producers of LNG in the U.S. to “breach” their contracts and deliver LNG cargoes to Europe. While we acknowledge the possibility of direct governmental action in Send Lawyers, (Gas) &amp; Money, particularly in the event of active war directly involving the United States and NATO, we stress that such actions at this time would be counterproductive, damaging to U.S. trade interests, and wholly unnecessary.

&gt; * From a political risk perspective, billion-plus dollar investments to secure LNG from the U.S. remain attractive relative to other regions, largely because they are commercially-centered with little government interference.

&gt; * In fact, the U.S. government has never terminated an export license for an operating LNG export project. To force U.S. LNG producers to breach their contracts now would forever tarnish that reputation, and could have a serious and deleterious impact on investment in future LNG projects that would otherwise provide precisely the kind of flexible LNG supply that came to Europe’s rescue just a few months ago.

&gt; * Such intervention, though possible, should be reserved for very unique circumstances and after exhausting the full extent of all soft power measures available to achieve its goals. Only then should the U.S. consider moving to more direct intervention.

&gt; * Moreover, the success of the “GasLift” over the last few months has demonstrated that such intervention is not necessary and would be unlikely to bring any incremental benefit to Europe, where terminals are already full with LNG from the U.S. and elsewhere.

Some of the codes are entirely public; others remain secret and can be used to improve accuracy and jamming resistance if you know the key.

The baseline L1 ""coarse/acquisition"" signal used to be intentionally degraded to about 50m accuracy via what was called ""selective availability"".

DoD turned off selective availability during the 1990-1991 Gulf War because many soldiers were using civilian GPS receivers; they then turned it back on afterward.

Selective availability was turned off permanently on May 1st, 2000; the ability to apply selective availability to the signal was removed from the block III GPS satellites which are in the process of being launched to incrementally update the constellation.

That said, GPS accuracy can still be degraded in a region if need be:

&gt; Clinton's executive order required SA to be set to zero by 2006; it happened in 2000 once the U.S. military developed a new system that provides the ability to deny GPS (and other navigation services) to hostile forces in a specific area of crisis without affecting the rest of the world or its own military systems.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Selective_availability

&gt;  Additionally, we have demonstrated the capability to selectively deny GPS signals on a regional basis when our national security is threatened. This regional approach to denying navigation services is consistent with the 1996 plan to discontinue the degradation of civil and commercial GPS service globally through the SA technique.

3) Orbital debris is a concern.  At the 550 km altitude StarLink flies at it'll deorbit within a few years, depending on ballistic coefficient.  Any fragment that gets its apogee raised with also have its perigee lowered so birds in higher orbits should be safe-ish.  The ISS is lower than these satellites, though, which is a big yikes.  China's space station too.

4) Russia used to benefit a lot from the space economy with a lot of money from launch contracts coming in.  ROSCOSMOS also provided cover for imports of dual use technology to be re-directed towards armaments.  But SpaceX has been eating their lunch recently and it isn't Russia benefiting from all the new LEO constellations going up.  So to some extent orbital debris is a problem that hurts Russia's enemies more than it hurts Russia, which would potentially be a leverage point for them.  Except another country with a big launch industry that wants to put up large numbers of LEO satellites is China and I don't think Russia can afford to be so cavalier about.

And accidentally hitting civilians is bad press that politicians care about. Predictably, artillery played a lesser role in both Afghanistan and Iraq over the air supremacy that Americans commanded.

But you don't just aim a gun and fire for artillery, you need to confirm the target and do firing calculations and hopefully have visual or some sensor in making sure you hit your mark or you need to readjust. You need to do this while potentially being under fire yourself and maintain concealment by periodically rotating firing positions. 15 minutes is probably rusty and lower tempo, but 5 minutes should be achieveable even for more fast developing situations.

They travel ahead of the artillery to a sector, usually just 1 or 2km from the front, and send up a drone to look for a target — anything from armour or troops (or sometimes to cover their infantry). Then they figure out the coordinates, telegraph the artillery guys and observe the subsequent strike. If it’s not accurate, they calibrate accordingly. Each evening, they return to base and watch a video of the day’s work.

&gt; * ""First,” he says. “I want to tell you about one of my heroes, John McCain.” Bereza tells me he met McCain in Washington DC following an official invitation. Bereza had commanded Ukrainian forces at the battle of Iloviask in which many of his troops had died — a disaster Bereza blamed on then-President Petro Poroshenko. He was filled with rage. “I didn’t view Poroshenko as my president, but McCain told me: ‘You have a bright future, but understand if you wear the uniform you must accept him as your president. You can throw him out at the ballot box later.’ And then we got drunk together. Then McCain came here to visit us. We showed him videos of what the Russians were doing in Ukraine.

No, the Russians have EW ground vehicles that are capable of jamming signals at altitude. They're these big trucks with huge radio dishes that can saturate large parts of the spectrum for extremely large areas. It's actually easier to jam at higher altitudes than for a given area on the ground, because there aren't any hills or anything in the way to block line of sight from the ground-based jammers to the plane.

&gt; What's the GPS (and competitors) situation like on a modern battlefield. Is it jammed all over by EW? 

Currently, the Russians are frequently messing with the spectrum all over Ukraine, which is why Starlink had to come up with a very impressive workaround for evading that jamming. I don't know what the Ukrainians are doing, and even if I did I wouldn't spread it around because EW is all about deception and secrecy. It's a cat and mouse game, with each party trying to spoof and jam selectively in certain areas to deceive or disable the enemy while still retaining their own navigation and comms abilities. 

I will say that many public US war gaming scenarios assume that the entire electronic spectrum is denied during a conflict with a country that has equivalent EW capabilities as Russia. Which means no GPS works at all, for any of the possible satellite constellations. So it's theoretically possible to do with the equipment the Russians have, although I do not think the Ukrainians have many comparable systems available. 

Either way, neither party in the current conflict seems to be carrying out complete broad spectrum jamming. The Russians seem to primarily be jamming navstar, the US GPS constellation, while not messing with the frequencies used by the European, Russian, and Chinese constellations.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"&gt; I do not think you can selectively jam GPS

This isn't quite true, depending on exactly what you mean. There are multiple different GPS satellite constellations in orbit, each of which operates on a different set of frequencies. Russia has been jamming the navstar (which is the US-owned GPS system) frequencies across much of Ukraine. It hasn't been jamming the frequencies for the European, Chinese, or Russian GPS constellations from what I have heard. 

They basically have these big trucks with generators and massive radio dishes that flood the relevant part of the electronic spectrum with noise that makes it impossible for ground receivers to pick up the much weaker signals from the satellites in orbit. They can selectively flood certain frequencies, while still allowing others to be used. So in theory, if they knew the Ukrainians were relying on navstar and their own forces were using one of the other constellations, then they could jam GPS for Ukrainians while still retaining the ability to use GPS themselves. 

The US also has similar capabilities, but I don't know if the Ukrainians have anything similar yet, nor do I know if the US is willing to use active EW measures on their behalf. 

There aren't really any countermeasures to this jamming beyond destroying the jammers. You can expand the band of frequencies transmitted from the satellites, or vary the frequencies on some unpredictable cycle, but that just requires broad spectrum jamming. Which denies use of the entire spectrum to absolutely everyone in the area, but the Russians might be willing to do if they decide it's better that no one have GPS or working radio comms at all. I believe the Russians have done so in Syria in the past. It's also not clear to me whether those adaptations would require hardware modifications to the physical satellites or ground receivers for a given constellation, which would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming, as opposed to just software updates that can be done on the fly. That is what made the Starlink adaptations so impressive. They were able to make software upgrades that allowed their ground stations and satellites to evade Russian jamming on an extremely short timeline.

In any case, I would expect that the EW environment is extremely complex and fluid, with some types of signals being spoofed or jammed in some places but not in others and those details constantly changing.",90c85fe9974208f70a777de850ac34cd59e63fa9,True,False,,,,,0,1652203782,,0,{},i82qilx,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i8231qs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i82qilx/,1652203801,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652174982.0,,

Oryx documents 643 tanks which is 24% of total, but that's probably the lower bound. Ukrainian army on the other hand reports 1170 which is 43%. Many tank losses are not documented because they were destroyed on the Russian occupied territory and they are probably less eager to report their losses. So I guess the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, but that still pushes up the percentage above 30%. Also, I assume that not all tanks are actually deployed in Ukraine.

&gt; powerfully armed proxy in the U.S.-led war on terror is also poorly understood, particularly its willingness to serve as the pointy end of the United States’ spear in Somalia. The TPLF-dominated Ethiopian army launched an invasion of Somalia in 2006 to destroy a grassroots governance movement, the Islamic Courts Union, that the United States perceived as threatening its national security interests—then brutally occupied the country for years afterwards.


&gt; Former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice is infamous in the Horn of Africa for laughing on television in 2015 over the U.S. endorsement of the TPLF-dominated government’s rigged 100 percent national election win. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama himself was lambasted after a 2012 visit to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during which he praised the “democratically elected” dictatorship as one of the finest governments in Africa.

Unlike you, I’ve been following political and geopolitical occurrences in the Horn of Africa for decades and am fully aware that coordinated government campaigns to influence public opinion is the least damaging of the toolbox Western countries have applied to Africa. I’ll respond to you when you come up with a coherent argument backed up with source actually explaining your disagreements.",9a8bb9f72379cb49309ac858020d3400eca130ac,True,False,,,,,0,1652202262,,0,{},i82mtw9,False,t3_ulr87c,False,True,t1_i81eqmh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulr87c/ethiopia_an_allout_war_looks_imminent_while/i82mtw9/,1652202272,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652173462.0,,

Apparently Ukraine's artillery doctrine has evolved from its Soviet roots to something that is even more radical with a shorter reaction time than even the Americans. Just 30s from call to trigger while United States had it at 15 minutes during parts of the Iraq War(but was capable of 5 minutes during WW2, but the current standard is 1 hours to get it legal vetted and prevent collateral damage and friendly fire).

The reliance is on an app called GIS ARTA that essentially crowdsources artillery shots from gun battery crews like Uber or Airbnb or Wikipedia, so each gun crew only fires a limited number of shots than reconceals. You don't have the classic Soviet massed artillery so the Russians cannot target it with counterbattery or fighter strikes as effectively. But the impact on the ground to the target seems to be devastating enough from multiple positions and allows for a fast reaction time in call to trigger time.

This could be the new face of modern warfare, decentralised command and control systems with no single point of failure deliverable with an app. It ties in with SpaceX's Starlink since Starlink keeps the app connected despite Russian attempts to kill that network connection to take the system down. Even so, one could envisage an even more decentralised version with mesh network nodes in theater but a satellite constellation uplink backbone using  is always handy for redundancies and reliability.",4bd24dcdd2818f56b1be3f3719cfe39550e4c07f,True,False,,,,,0,1652202222,,0,{},i82mqdk,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t3_umh1p3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i82mqdk/,1652202234,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652173422.0,,

Russian squad size is vehicle space limited, 13 means more than can even ride on the roof. 

A fourth squad in the platoon means every Russian platoon tactic has to be rewritten as they're meant for three units. Also means command and control issues since platoon leadership already has issues with just three squads. Same goes for four companies per battalion. Also, they don't have the logistics or support to suddenly support a massively enlarged bassoon battalion so battalion staff needs to increase as well as the battalion trains. Same goes for Regt/bde level support units, they'd need way more. 

I don't buy any of this, so while we know they lost tens of thousands of casualties they didn't just bring units back to pre invasion strength (which we know they didn't) but they increased their unit sizes by a full extra battalion at the Regt/bde level, a full extra company at the battalion level, a full platoon at the company level, a full squad at the platoon level, and doubled the squad size?

For example let's say they did that to one brigade that started with two motor rifle battalions of three motor rifle companies each of three platoons of three squads of 8. Just counting those, no command, staff, support, that's 648 infantrymen per bde (8, 24, 72, 216 per battalion). This mid-war size reform as described would increase that to 768 per battalion with three battalions to a bde being 2,304 infantryman. So we're to believe they increased the size of every bde by a factor of 3.5?

Quotes:

&gt; * Among the many issues being raised in Canada over Russia’s brutal, unprovoked war in Ukraine is the state of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and its equipment. As the lack of highly sought-after anti-tank and anti-aircraft portable missile systems in the CAF’s inventory makes abundantly clear, the type and quantity of equipment held by a country’s military has a direct bearing on its foreign policy.

&gt; * This set of circumstances, illuminated by the war in Ukraine, has seen pundits like the Globe and Mail’s John Ibbitson, and other defence observers, cast about for solutions for Canada to quickly re-arm, or at least modernize its armed forces, to prepare for such a rapidly uncertain and unstable geopolitical environment. One clear idea the commentariat have focused on is buying off-the-shelf (OTS) equipment. OTS advocates believe that Canada could acquire the equipment the CAF needs faster and cheaper from existing suppliers, who are overwhelmingly found overseas in allies like France, Italy, Germany and the U.K. This would be the military equivalent of going to a car dealership and buying straight off the lot instead of building domestically to help satisfy federal industrial goals or modifying (Canadianizing) foreign equipment to meet CAF particularities, something critics blast as wish-list behaviour that adds to costs and delays.

&gt; * As tempting as it is to believe that there is a straightforward solution to Canada’s perennial defence procurement woes, caution on an OTS-based model is warranted. 

&gt; * First, when it comes to complex, big-ticket items like Ottawa’s 15, $62 billion (at least) Canadian surface combatant (CSC) warships or $19 billion future fighter capability jet project, off-the-shelf does not actually exist. The term can mean either an item that’s currently in production and is physically available like a car at a dealership or, more commonly, it can mean a design that’s available for purchase to use in new production. Both of these options convey more problems than would appear at first glance.

&gt; * For an item already in production, the design is already several years old. 

&gt; * Simply buying a German submarine off the shelf would leave the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) with a submarine limited in range and needing additional expenditures in support infrastructure to ensure it can meet the demands of long-range patrols in a country with the world’s longest coastline. 

&gt; * The U.S.-made Chinook, in production in various variants since the early 1960s, required numerous Canadianization changes to adjust to the operational realities of flying long distances with access to sparse support infrastructure (e.g., larger fuel tanks), with each change requiring more testing and recertifications to prove airworthiness. The first Canadian Chinook entered CAF service five years later in 2013.

&gt; * To make matters more complicated, and this may well be the biggest factor, is the simple matter of sheer production capacity. A foreign manufacturer may simply not have the ability to produce items for Canada without unacceptable sacrifices for its main clients, especially if such items will take years or decades to complete in their entirety. 

&gt; * OTS therefore does not guarantee quicker or cheaper outcomes for large, complex equipment.

&gt; * Contrary to the assumptions of many Canadian defence observers, an OTS approach has in fact been taken to some degree with many of Canada’s biggest procurement projects in an effort to reduce risks.

About the Canadian Global Affairs Institute

The Canadian Global Affairs Institute focuses on the entire range of Canada’s international relations in all its forms including (in partnership with the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy), trade investment and international capacity building. Successor to the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute (CDFAI, which was established in 2001), the Institute works to inform Canadians about the importance of having a respected and influential voice in those parts of the globe where Canada has significant interests due to trade and investment, origins of Canada’s population, geographic security (and especially security of North America in conjunction with the United States), social development, or the peace and freedom of allied nations. The Institute aims to demonstrate to Canadians the importance of comprehensive foreign, defence and trade policies which both express our values and represent our interests.

About the Authors

* Timothy Choi is completing his Ph.D. at the University of Calgary's Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies, where his dissertation is entitled, “Maritime Strategies of the North: The Seapower of Smaller Maritime Forces in an Era of Broadened Security.” It asks how the Danish, Norwegian, and Canadian maritime forces developed in response to the adoption and legitimization of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone, and whether smaller forces have generalizable differences in such responses compared to larger ones. This has seen him sailing with Danish and Norwegian patrol vessels to gain deeper insights into the tactical level of peacetime naval activities. He is a former Smith Richardson Predoctoral Fellow at Yale University's International Security Studies, where he worked with Professor Paul Kennedy, and is also a Research Fellow at Dalhousie University's Centre for the Study of Security and Development. He serves on the editorial board of and is the photo editor at the Canadian Naval Review.  Outside of academia, his interests and expertise include scale ship modeling, photography, and social media outreach. 

* Jeffrey F. Collins earned a PhD in political science from Carleton University in 2018. He also holds a MA in strategic studies (Birmingham), a law degree (Aberdeen), and a BA and certificate in public administration (Memorial). He is an experienced federal policy advisor and a research fellow with both the University of Manitoba's Centre for Defence and Security Studies and Dalhousie University's Centre for the Study of Security and Development, respectively.

Jeffrey's research interests are in defence procurement, missile defence, Canadian and Australian defence policy and the Arctic.

[],False,,FirstDictonary,,,[],,,,text,t2_3si6s2gw,False,False,"I do see a potential problem with Ukraine fielding M1128 MGS, that being the logistics and costs behind the maintenance of the system. 

Considering this article discussing why the M1128s were divested in the first place: https://www.army.mil/article/246274/army_announces_divestiture_of_the_stryker_mobile_gun_system

Essentially, the Army divested the M1128 due various factors including: low survivability against land mines and IEDs due to the lack of a v-shaped hull, the sheer cost of maintaining the autoloader system as well as the gun system, and the availability of other less complex alternatives. 

And consider this quote: 

“The divestiture of the Stryker MGS poses no impact to the industrial base as the system has been out of production for some time, and the majority of the sustainment supply chain for the MGS is included in other variants of the current Stryker fleet.”

So yes, at least the parts common to the Stryker family chassis are interchangeable. However, as the first sentence points out, the production for the M1128 Stryker had been halted for some time. This ostensibly impacts the availability of parts for the autoloader and M68A1E4 gun itself. There probably is a stockpile of parts, but the supply for these critical parts is inherently limited.

More anecdotally, the M1128 Stryker had other issues. Its suspension is comprised of 8 pneumatic struts that require constant calibration to ensure a smooth ride. Good for your average Stryker. Not so good when you have a recoil problem that is so bad it can break a strut or worse break a nitrogen line that allows for the adjustment of the suspension. So we got suspension issues too. Although, these particular components are standard for all Stryker variants, the M1128 will cycle through more of them than their brethren. 

And then consider this is the US Army that has issues with it. Now consider Ukraine which has a weaker logistics system. How do you get parts to the front? How long would it take to train technicians to repair these systems? And there are other factors. Out of the approximately 150 out there, how many are in operating conditions considering the M1128 Stryker’s less than stellar record of being broken down more often than not? 

We have alternatives like the Bradley or the other Stryker variants.

To gain a land bridge to Transnistra means attacking from Kherson westwards, which means UA has to defend it with lots of ground troops, while also defending it with lots of ADA because it's being targeted by air strikes.

Russia wants a breakthrough in the Severodonetsk salient offensive, the theater main effort, but can't get one unless all UA reserves in the area are already committed before the next attack happens that could rupture UA lines. If UA have a reserve available, they can plug up a breakout attempt, backup the defense counterattack, etc. To stop more UA forces from arriving in the JFO area to reinforce and get added to the reserve the Russians need to try to get them committed elsewhere. The best place for them to be is as far away from the Donbas as possible.

All of this together raises a bit of an alarm. By going all in, Putin creates conditions for an existential threat to develop if RuAF can't achieve his goals.

I mean, that's pretty much a MAD situation between the two of them anyway, so there wouldn't be all that much point in nuking them further. The issue would be the survivors more than bringing those responsible to justice.

Israel doesn't seem to have been threatening other countries with them, they were threatening the US, through private channels, that they would use them on someone.

Twice, in all of history, immediately after they were first invented and before anyone had a real sense of their potential.

It’s time to make better use of the Territorial Defense Brigade. Recent legislation allows Ukraine to deploy them away from home. They aren’t all that useful as offensive units, but have proven their competence in static defense. The goal would be to back fill them to locations where UF brigades are currently static. Six western TD brigades should be asked to provide a battalion and a battery, and two provisional defense brigades should replace the 5th Armor brigade and the 5th Air Assault Brigade watching Odessa.

Speaking of Odessa- An amphib landing was always a red herring, even more so with the losses to the Russian Navy and the availability of anti-ship missiles. I say, give defense to the Air Force, which is capable of full operation in this district and look to the east.

East is Kherson, which is more important operationally than strategically. There’s 5 trained armed forces brigades watching a pocket that a single TD brigade could hold.

First blow the Kherson bridge. It’s been rigged by the Russians, it’s never coming back to Ukraine, so blow it, and cut off Kherson. It may already be within artillery range,and if not, a minor offensive, reinforced by the 5Th Armor should be easily capable of driving a salient through open fields  between Krysilevska and Olekstrabdivka to close the range. This woulda leave supply for the whole sector to the single road over the   Dam at Kozatsky, with most of the supply routes north and south subject to ambush and artillery. The front should collapse on its own, or they may be driven back across the river, it hardly matters. A single TD Brigade would then be sufficient to hold the Dnipro, and six more regular brigades are ready for refit and fresh action. 

Finally, Kharkiv is about ready for the same make over. Give the UAF another week of pursuit and ground gain, then turn it over to the territorial. The tactical goal here is to drive the Russians out of artillery range, not take Belgogrod.  Even leaving a AF reserve, that’s another 3 brigades of regulars ready for refit/recommit. 

By hose three small actions, that’s two full divisions of reguar army freed up for more important work- Though it will probably cost Ukraine Soverodenetsk. It’s probably time for a staged retreat from there anyway, better to conduct it on one’s own terms, rather than be routed out. It’s developed into a meat grinder, and though Ukraine’s giving more than it’s getting, a toe to toe slugging match for a salient that’s likely to fall anyway is poor use of troops. By backing off, the Popsana advance is neutralized, Russian supply lines are lengthened, there’s time get the rest of those lovely 155s deployed, and there’s no salient to defend from three sides. And it will be at least a week and probably more for Russia to organize  themselves enough to engage the new line.

These moves and this time would give Ukraine time to reduce Izium  a bit and prepare for the fresh force about to descend from Belgograd.",411fc6aad82c8d3c23a9d76ec43b5e100d277c5e,True,False,,,,,0,1652190089,,0,{},i81spay,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t3_umh1p3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i81spay/,1652190104,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652161289.0,,

2. Their fate are sealed, and unlike the Polish T-72s, there's no replacement problem needing to be solved.
3. They are currently under active service and being maintained, so no major overhaul required compare to pulling leopard 1 or something alike from storage.
4. There are \~150 of them out there, with parts and related materials all in one place, so higher economy of scale.
5. The Russians are going to say what they want regardless of what was being sent, but on the political front it's less provocative to send ""redundant armored cars"" than sending tanks.
6. Logistically speaking, it's not ideal to send completely new system to Ukraine compare to former USSR-stuffs. But they have to face this problem sooner or later. After all it's the Ukraine who are asking for combat vehicles.

I recognize that the official US government [GPS.gov](https://GPS.gov) web site may not be fully accurate for simplicity or security reasons, but it seems to be saying something different, at least as to how it works now.[https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/](https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/) 

&gt;**Is military GPS more accurate than civilian GPS?**  
The user range error (URE) of the GPS signals in space is actually the same for the civilian and military GPS services. However, most of today's civilian devices use only one GPS frequency, while military receivers use two.  
  
Using two GPS frequencies improves accuracy by correcting signal distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. Dual-frequency GPS equipment is commercially available for civilian use, but its cost and size has limited it to professional applications.  
  
With augmentation systems, civilian users can actually receive better GPS accuracy than the military.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Doesn't the government degrade civilian GPS accuracy?**  
No. During the 1990s, GPS employed a feature called Selective Availability that intentionally degraded civilian accuracy on a global basis.  
  
In May 2000, at the direction of President Bill Clinton, the U.S. government ended its use of Selective Availability in order to make GPS more responsive to civil and commercial users worldwide.  
  
The United States has no intent to ever use Selective Availability again.

Maybe what you are describing is how Selective Availability functions and in theory US could switch SA back on?

That's more or less the history of absolute monarchies like France and Russia, other European states took on slightly different courses. The classic counter-example is England, where the nobility and the upper middle class triumphed over the monarchy and organised themselves into a Parliament that bound the nation's destiny together.

History has quite justifiably framed the former approach as more tyrannical and leading to a much greater number of atrocities. Contemporary morality does not allow for such means to justify the end, especially when the evils of tyranny are prone to lead to future wars and revolutions (the history of Russia provides a good example). The ethnic element may be subdued, but that does not guarantee stability.

You say you should seek to make Ethiopia more ""like us"" which I assume means the United States. In that case, there is nothing farther from the United States, a union of many political entities that came to be bound together by voluntary consent and gradual increases of federal power, than the tyrannical destruction of regional power and the complete submission to a centre.

[],False,,thisvideoiswrong,,,[],,,,text,t2_xw6ki,False,False,"The real cost to the rest of the world in 2.b would be the potential end of the nuclear taboo. Ukraine would be totally irrelevant compared to that, both from the perspective of domestic political audiences and from the perspective of the geopolitical situation. At that point there seem to be essentially four options:

2.b.i MAD. A nuke was used, the expected response is the immediate firing of the entire arsenal of strategic weapons. This is probably unlikely, but it's more or less what the public would expect, and so anything less will be viewed as a weak response with an associated political cost, although also with relief since the world didn't end immediately.

2.b.ii No or minimal response. The implications of this for domestic and international politics would be extreme. Leaders in democracies would be unlikely to survive their next election, and countries that do not currently have nuclear weapons would have to consider what their options would be for responding themselves if a nuke were used on them, meaning they would each have to aggressively pursue acquiring their own nuclear deterrent. Taiwan, South Korea, and Iran would be some of the first in line, since they are all balanced on the brink of conflict with nuclear nations, while still being stable and prosperous enough to pretty easily do it. This proliferation of nuclear weapons would also dramatically increase the chances of non-state actors acquiring nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the use of further nukes in future conflicts would be assured, likely leading to further escalation in the future. Given those immense costs I would consider this the least likely possibility.

2.b.iii Proportional response. One tactical nuke for one tactical nuke, hopefully delivered directly to Putin's bunker via B-2 bomber rather than to those less responsible, or possibly to the launch site. Pile on diplomatic repercussions as well, since every country would have to do something to make the point. Significantly more likely than the previous two options, but of course it certainly does come with a risk of further escalation by Russia.

2.b.iv Conventional response. No nuclear weapons use, but extreme diplomatic repercussions for Russia and simultaneously the entry of numerous additional countries into the war. In order to fully prevent the future possibilities of ii Putin personally would have to be targeted, along with other people viewed as responsible, to ensure that future nuclear weapon use would be viewed as a catastrophic mistake by anyone considering it, in addition to fully and rapidly removing all Russian forces from Ukraine and probably at least parts of Russia. Again relatively likely, but again with a high risk of further escalation. Even if Russia were to simply re-nuke the same spot but now with the troops of a nuclear-armed nation on it that would be a massive escalation with an extreme risk of full nuclear exchange.

I'm not dividing out responses by different countries or blocs here, because I don't think there would be that much disagreement over the need for response. Those first countries in line for nukes included both Iran (which would be totally unacceptable to at least Israel and Saudi Arabia, which the US aligns with strongly, while Europe largely aligns with the US) and Taiwan (which would be unacceptable to China), which are about as far from being aligned as you can get. However, those countries currently aren't aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons because they don't want things to ever go there either, and it's currently simply safer to just have strong conventional forces. Pretty much every country will agree that extreme action to reestablish the nuclear taboo is necessary to safeguard their own interests.

This is why so many people think that the best option for Putin is to keep the war as limited as he can so he can try to back down if or when it becomes clear to him that a full victory is impossible. Escalation of any kind is unlikely to win him the war but will ensure that more people are more angry at him afterwards. The question is whether he sees it that way.",856b12d4f84f9a380b80e5bc9b47d6b7f3b8c213,True,False,,,,,0,1652183484,,0,{},i81fx9f,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t1_i80uj5r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i81fx9f/,1652183501,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652154684.0,,

Primarily because I think the way one could frame this conflict is that this is a proxy war between the West and China, and the Chinese getting their hands on the latest western war machinery would be a disaster.

 Covert mobilization in Russia began, according to some sources, at the beginning of the year.  By January 30, at least 85 thousand reservists (""partisans"") were called up for training.  Reservists were also announced in February.  A recruitment of contract soldiers to the troops and PMCs was carried out.  Starting from mid-April, according to some sources, at least 60,000 people were recruited.

 In total, according to certain estimates, up to 200-250 thousand people were mobilized today, without the LDNR (quite comparable to Ukraine).

 Your obedient servant at one time assumed that Russia needed a million fighters for the campaign in Ukraine.  Without mobilization at home, subject to mobilization in the LDNR (which we consider), it was possible for us to field up to 700-800 thousand people.  Considering everyone in general (as in the case of Ukraine, a single method of calculation is needed).

 I'll expand on the thesis.  By the time the NMD began, Russia had concentrated 190-200 thousand people on the borders with Ukraine, according to Western estimates.  Including mobilized reservists.

 The rear - the same civilian personnel, because much was transferred to outsourcing - amounted to 170-200 thousand people.  This, it seems, is without the potential of the Aerospace Forces and the Navy: another 70-80 thousand people per circle (without rears).  The Russian Guard numbered up to 60-70 thousand people (without rears), the LDNR (after mobilization) - at least 100 thousand (together with rears).  Plus the border troops of the FSB.

 For a circle, all this amounted - together with the rear and civilian personnel, of course - the notorious 700-800 thousand people.  Don't be put off by this huge value.  The number of ""active bayonets"" among these significant digital expressions did not really exceed 120-150 thousand people (half - LDNR).

 Additional covert mobilization from February to May, the accompanying increase in rears, were able to bring the number of Russian and LDNR forces on the border to almost a million people.  At the same time, the number of ""active bayonets"" is unlikely to have grown significantly: no more than 150-200 thousand people today.

 • Increase in the number of people in the departments (from 6-7 to 11-13 people), the introduction of the fourth department in platoons.  It is capable of leading, taking into account the shortage that took place by the beginning of the SVO, to no less than doubling the number of ""active bayonets"" (that is, by 150 thousand people compared to the initial values);

Mobilization in Russia and Ukraine.  Questions of the real potential of the parties

 1. UKRAINE:

 By the beginning of the special military operation, its troops numbered 209 thousand people in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 102 thousand - the territorial defense, up to 120-130 thousand (in total) - NSU, GPSU, Special Communications, Special Transport Service, etc.  All total - 430-440 thousand people.

 It should be noted that this value included civilian personnel (up to 100 thousand people).  That is, in general, everyone.

 Until April 2022, inclusive, there were three waves of mobilization - for 60 thousand, 60 thousand and 70 thousand people - 190 thousand people were called up (officially).  At the same time, the losses of Ukrainian troops today amount to at least 40-50 thousand military personnel (killed, wounded and captured).  They also have a high percentage of desertion: at least 20-30 thousand people.

 That is, according to the results of the mobilisation events, they had up to 550 thousand people in the ranks.  Including, it is worth repeating again, everybody.  Including numerous rather civilian personnel.

 In addition, from May 15, a fourth wave of mobilization is expected, with the help of which it is planned to sweep up, according to various sources, another 70 to 100 thousand unlucky people (in total, mobilization will affect 260-290 thousand people by the summer).  According to the results, there will be up to 620-650 thousand people in the ranks.  In general, everyone.

 Of these, active bayonets (that is, those who directly conduct hostilities) will amount to 150 thousand people (25%).  Counting only more or less trained active bayonets as part of well-coordinated units - 60-70 thousand people (10%).

 So it was the case with Russia during the Civil War.  Especially at the final stage, when 100,000 of the five million Red Army actually fought, being transferred from front to front.

 Accordingly, a high percentage of losses for them, especially among ""active bayonets"", is fraught with a loss of combat capability.",b95f09b701bbc09224a1c71a278eed741a2363b9,True,False,,,,,0,1652178966,,0,{},i8197fa,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t3_ulpliz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i8197fa/,1652178981,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652150166.0,,

you think they're just being allowed to freely waltz around the battlefield? Someone is in control of telling them where they can go and when. Beyond that it's hard to draw any conclusions.

If there's one thing the ukrainians have done very well this conflict it's handle the media and ensure their talking points get out. Make of that what you will.

&gt;  It's one thing to say that data is not the same thing as information, it's another entirely to imply that the existence of data somehow obscures the actual reality of conditions on the ground. If you strictly base your understanding of the war on twitter posts within the last hour you'll be completely clueless but over time OSINT generally crystallises into a representative picture of the war.

IDD. I guess my point was more that the plethora of footage has done a good job of reinforcing the *horrors of war* and general human suffering more than anything. In a way that say the syrian conflict couldn't because 1. people didn't care as much and 2. there was less 'online crossover'. In the moment it's very hard to glean much of use from anything (as a layperson) otherr than for example 'an explosion has happened in a place that could be x'. Not to mention that both sides will invariably be working very hard in the social media information war space and filtering through the noise is a challenge... again especially given that everything is happening in a foreign language.

&gt; You're taking reasonable criticisms about bias, polarisation and sensationalism and using them to completely discredit news in aggregate. 

It's not about discrediting. I just find the state of the media and reporting to be tragically lacklustre and a large part of why democracy in the west is in turmoil. Do you disagree with the systemic problems i laid out that lead to it being so?

&gt; Mainstream news isn't going to be sufficient to get a completely informed perspective on a conflict like the one in Ukraine... but it's also not going to lie to you, it's probably going to get the broad strokes correct and it will highlight appropriate figures who are informed about the war.

See that's where i have to disagree. The media *constantly* repeats essentially fabricated narratives devoid of any appropriate context, especially when it comes to foreign affairs. Broadly the facts may be accurate enough on close inspection, but as the economist Ronald Coase said “If you torture the data long enough it will confess”.

What always matters is the narrative being spun, because the narrative and the framing entirely determine how information will be interpreted and understood. Omission of essential context is no different in practice than lying, because it makes the 'facts' unintelligible. 

Putin's 'propaganda' is almost largely 'factual' in nature. Does that make it the narrative that we wish to follow? Of course not. If you look at his full speeches the only thing he's regularly dishonest about is his own historic actions. The whole point of propaganda is that it works best if it's rooted in something real. There are facts in there, but the way they are portrayed and interpreted is entirely warped. 

Look at the interview i posted below. The russian representative factually states that ukraine had half it's forces on the border with Donbas. The *narrative* is that they were about to attack donbas and therefore Russia felt the need to retaliate. It's based on facts, but it's not really true is it? Because it's omitting key context and information and replacing it with a nice story (based on facts) to sell a perspective.

For a different example. the BBC's political journalism has fallen through the floor in recent years because they have in fact taken their 'objective reporting' to the absurd extreme in the other direction. They now just report 'factually' what has been said, and don't take the time or effort to 'introduce bias' by actually analysing or interrogating it. What this means is that it can just be used and abused by politicians. Boris johnson says something objectively false and slanderous - the BBC reports 'Boris has said x'.

All to make the point that facts are utterly useless without context and critique. We rely on the media to take 'all the facts' and interpret them through a lens whilst also providing accurate context, albeit through a particular lens/frame. The problem is that these days they don't have the time or expertise to actually understand all the facts or context in the first place, let alone report on them. Huge numbers of stories are in fact just taken from other news sources and parroted, which presumably has a 'chinese whispers' effect.

&gt; Whenever western media talk about the conflict itself though they will absolutely be factually accurate with their reporting and that is not a standard that you can apply to the reporting of Russian media.

Well i don't know about your news sources, but for weeks the vast majority of ukraine war headlines were just 'x has happened  *according to ukrainian government reports*'. Now don't get me wrong i doubt there were many credible sources, but putting an exclaimer after parroting the reports of a government involved in their own industrial scale propaganda campaign isn't some 'get out of jail free' card that gets you off the hook for reporting what is likely very warped information.

Again i don't think that it's an intentional thing on the part of the journos, i think it's due to a whole bunch of systemic issues (mainly a lack of resources). Though journalism is very much a dying industry and those wanting to get their foot on the career ladder these days often have to sell out to get anywhere as far as i can tell.

This isn't some 'you can't trust the MSM' QAnon conspiracy mumbo jumbo FWIW. The media can still do good work in isolation and there's some fantastic investigative journalism that still exists where the funding hasn't yet dried up. I just think that reporting on the whole is in particular extremely problematic when it comes to foreign affairs in countries that people are unfamiliar with.... because it means that those reporting on it invariably don't understand what they're reporting in the first place.",510489388ede867294674e38177c1f987638d9c0,True,False,,,,,0,1652170300,,0,{},i80z4r4,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t1_i7zggy3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i80z4r4/,1652170315,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652141500.0,,

The idea is to try to get the best outcome you can with the level of risk you’re willing to take. The West wasn’t then, nor is it now, willing to take the risk of supplying Ukraine with the most bleeding edge technology to fight Russia. There are a myriad of reasons for this. They may end up not being necessary seeing that Russia is still waging this war with Soviet era tech, the training required for it is too complex, the logistics and back end support required is overwhelming, the attrition rate is too high within well trained Ukrainians, Ukrainian morale will fade and they’ll surrender (though this is not really a relevant factor anymore but certainly was for the first few weeks), etc etc.

Key Findings

* On a trip to Barcelona in 2017, Nikolai Sadovnikov offered to give the Catalonians $500 billion to aid their attempts to make the region an independent state.
* In return, he asked them to turn Catalonia into a haven for cryptocurrencies.
* A Western intelligence agency described him as “an actor of Russian parallel diplomacy” who accompanied Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on trips around the Middle East.
* After Sadovnikov left Barcelona, text messages show the Catalonians stayed in touch through an intermediary.
* The intermediary kept promising money, sending the Catalonians photographs of a suitcase full of cash and a certificate of deposit worth $500 billion. But reporters could only confirm he ever sent them a single bitcoin.
* Sadovnikov held shares in four companies registered in a government-owned building in Red Square.


&gt; * In the run-up to Catalonia’s historic 2017 parliamentary vote to declare independence from Spain, the leader of the restive region received a shocking offer. A mysterious “Russian group” reportedly offered president Carles Puigdemont money and 10,000 armed soldiers to make the break with Madrid.

&gt; * Now, for the first time, a joint investigation by OCCRP, El Periódico, Bellingcat, IRPI, Il Fatto Quotidiano, and iStories reveals key new details about that offer, how it was made — and by whom.

&gt; * …Nikolai Sadovnikov, whom Catalonian independence leaders privately described as “Putin’s envoy.” The former Soviet and Russian diplomat had a history of representing the Kremlin in sensitive conflict areas and had been noticed by at least one Western intelligence agency, which flagged him as having a direct line to the Russian head of state.

&gt; * The involvement of a figure with Sadovnikov’s resume suggests that Moscow’s efforts to foment division in Spain may have been more serious than previously known. 

&gt; * The report describes Sadovnikov as “an actor of Russian parallel diplomacy in Syria and Iran.” Although he acted under the umbrella of the foreign ministry, “he is accountable only to the head of state, with whom he claims a certain proximity.”

&gt; * Kremlin-watchers have long warned that President Vladimir Putin had come to believe that undermining European unity was in Russia’s interest.

&gt; * …it sounds like we’re looking at covert, intelligence-backed support for an separatist movement with a scam or fraud component on the side.”

&gt; * Giles agreed that the Russian overtures to Catalonia looked like “a mixed operation between political interference and the drive for profit.”

&gt; * …new information obtained by reporters — from text messages, interviews with knowledgeable parties, intelligence reports, and court records — provide a wealth of additional detail. Reporters were able to establish that the offer took place at a meeting with Nikolai Sadovnikov, and an attendee confirmed that Sadovnikov himself had made it.",15ef8e8a831c64a734ddb30d8c59463f13b19cb7,True,False,,,,,0,1652154341,,0,{},i80c3f8,True,t3_um9bfm,False,True,t3_um9bfm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/um9bfm/fueling_secession_promising_bitcoins_how_a/i80c3f8/,1652154356,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652125541.0,,

And I only scratched the surface with logistics because such an invasion would require coordination from all parts of the PLA. That's a logistic nightmare and a half. 

Taiwan is also learning from Ukraine and if anything, Ukraine is a wake up call that peace may not hold forever. Time will tell whether Taiwan will take the actions necessary to defend their country. When a nation gets invaded, don't expect those percentages to hold as they are guaranteed to drop. The poll results are concerning a peaceful resolution, not an military ""liberation"". Mariupol was never exactly pro-Ukraine, until the Russians came. I don't think I need to go into detail about that.  


And yes, despite the relative lack of mountains (the southern part of the island is still mountainous), there are other obstacles. Rice fields, marshes, and urban areas. They're easier to assault but not by much. The former two, Vietnam vets and paratroopers during Operation Overlord can attest to how much of a pain they are while the latter provides plentiful cover. The terrain and environment may not be perfectly in Taiwan's favor but it is certainly not in China's favor.  


And helicopters. Okay, I admit, I laughed at that. How many helicopters would it take for a significant force to get across the Taiwan Strait? Probably in the hundreds. Helicopters can only carry a limited amount of troops and equipment. Some American amphibious assault ships don't have a well deck because they don't need one as amphibious landing docks exist. And other amphibious assault ships do have well decks. Truth of the matter, landing craft are able to carry more troops and equipment than helicopters can. If helicopters are used, then they are used to either to ferry troops quickly when the situation is clear or to insert infantry behind enemy defensive lines to disrupt them, inhibiting the enemy's ability to hold off the main assault on the beaches. Usually these days, its the former. The Russians can attest that flushing out MANPADs or ATGMs that can hit helicopters tends to be a bit \*difficult\* to say the least. You don't put a helicopter into a hot LZ. You either have to clear the immediate LZ or find another way to the LZ in one piece. Good luck. You better have the best pilot with you.  


Sarcasm aside, this is the kind of situation where there is a lot of uncertainty. Taiwan's mission is to delay the Chinese assault until reinforcements come while China's job is to take Taiwan before said reinforcements come. And there are countless factors we cannot account for. The corruption within the Chinese PLA for example. The Chinese government has made efforts to reduce it, but is it enough? Are the efforts made by the Chinese enough to revamp their military structure? Equipment are easy to update or replace. People and the way they think are not.   


We could be here all day but, it is frankly useless to discuss this as the conflict is unlikely to spark now. The last thing China needs at the moment is to get into the spotlight. Russia has become a pariah on the world stage. Why join them?  


Best thing China can do is to fill the power gap that Russia leaves and we've already seen some moves towards that with Xi's recent speech calling for economic collaboration and efforts to ""safeguard peace"" in Asia.

&gt; Despite the messy complexities of this conflict, the media has tended to frame the war as a government-instigated genocide against the people of Tigray, or even as a civil war (a term that implies parity between the broad support enjoyed by Ethiopia’s elected government against the fringe, ethnic-based constituencies of the TPLF and its equally fringe ally, the Oromo Liberation Front’s violent Shene faction, which the TPLF itself previously regarded as a terrorist group).

&gt;The TPLF’s strategic communications have followed the same playbook as in the 1980s, when conflict narratives carefully targeted the policy agenda of international donors and tainted Ethiopia’s then-government, a Marxist regime known as the Derg, with accusations of crimes against humanity.

https://www.ethiopiaobserver.com/2020/12/16/western-medias-federal-govt-bias-in-coverage-of-tigray-conflict/

&gt; The standard line used by the Western media such as Reuters, BBC, VOA, DW was that “Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Africa’s youngest leader and the recipient of a 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, launched a military offensive against his own people in the Tigray region”, in a typically clear-cut ‘good-versus-evil’ frame. The ‘evil’ side personified in a single figure of Abiy Ahmed. “His country is – at the very least – on the verge of civil war. Why has he chosen military force to resolve his dispute with Tigray?” asked Andrew Mueller of The Foreign Desk, the current affairs program on online radio station Monocle 24. This would have been a fair question had the Tigray leadership had been an innocent player and an irreproachable body. Disengaging the events from the broader issues relative to the conflict and disregarding the provocations TPLF has been mounting against the federal government for the past two years, the western media chose to focus on the PM, taking the liberty to label and demonize him as “the Nobel Peace Prize Winner turned Belligerent Warmaker”, while representing TPLF as an innocent victim, often in an insidious way.

&gt;The steps TPLF has been taking to sabotage Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s rule in ways that harm the economy and the transition process has been overlooked by the media, even though a cursory look around suggests that. At least, that claim by the federal administration of justifying the offensive as the struggle to counter the continuing sabotage should have got fair coverage. However, the journalists, for some reasons, chose to reflect only TPLF’s storyline, unwittingly reinvigorated by so-called scholars who have picked up “facts” that were actually not facts to begin with.",69b5807314c73bca8d30ebbe588a7f5e53797ece,True,False,,,,,0,1652148413,,0,{},i7zzykc,False,t3_ulr87c,False,True,t1_i7zx8bg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulr87c/ethiopia_an_allout_war_looks_imminent_while/i7zzykc/,1652148423,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652119613.0,,

[],False,,No_Caregiver_5740,,,[],,,,text,t2_7t004dxg,False,False,"This is kinda where the messy details on the Chinese system comes in, I hope you're ready for some reading. Ok so when the party was founded, the top guy held 3 different positions. 

1. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party - This one is the most powerful and HAS NO TERM LIMIT
2. The Chair of the Central Military Commision (CMC)
3. President of the People's Republic of China - this is largely a ceremonial role, this role is in charge of the actions of the National People's Congress (NPC) - THIS ONE HAD THE TERM LIMIT FOR A BIT

So how this was supposed to work is that you have the Party structure and then everything else is built around the party, think the of a hub and spoke- the party is in the center, and connected to it you got the CMC, NPC,  and the State Council (state council = China's EPA, FAA, IRS you know those kinds of orgs, kinda like the cabinet). The NPC is kinda supposed to be where local gov's, trade unions and professional groups get their voice in on legislation, they actually have a bigger impact on legislation then people think, but overall they play kinda an advisory role and rubber stamp stuff. 

So in 1954 the top guy holds all 3 positions. Long story short due to cultural revolution and chaos and stuff- the constitution is reformed in 1979 and the President becomes a different guy. It has mixed results, Deng felt like the separate president is holding back reforms so by 1993, the General Secretary adds back the role of the presidency, but with a 2 term limit. Jiang kept it because he was old and had no choice due to the General secretary position having a age limit, and Hu Jintao held it because he was the former Vice president of the NPC before he became general sec so he felt a stronger affinity for the rules. 

OK so Xi comes in - his first major policy is the anti corruption campaign, which to everyone's surprise, actually imprisoned members of the standing committee, the most powerful group in China directly under the General Sec. It is debatable if Xi was doing it to purge rivals or was just an honest effort, but there is no denying that the people caught were corrupt AF. Thing is that the corruption purge got many of the potential leaders from the ""6th generation"" and thus not many potential successors. So now Xi decides to remove term limits, for these potential reasons

1. He needs more time to cultivate the 7th generation of the CCP and leaving early without a clear successor is pretty chaotic 
2. He didn't want to be a lame duck leader in his second term, where the organizations of the party that don't like him, stall and wait for the successor 
3. He actually is a power hungry maniac who knows. 

But the actual decision itself to remove the presidential term limits wasn't too big of a deal, since already there were no term limits on the CMC chair and the general sec chair, and both of those positions are much more powerful. And since Deng removed the separation between those positions and the presidency, its basically affirmed that the president position isn't a position that is distinct from the General Sec position. So the precedence of the 2 term limit is kinda moot anyway, cause otherwise there would be a term limit on the  General Sec position, not the presidency. *There really isn't much dissent around the changing of the term limits, at least in the upper levels of Gov, since it was common knowledge to them that the president position basically doesnt matter.* 

The real kicker to see if Xi is power hungry maniac is if he stays past 2027. Xi will be 74, and the oldest someone got elected to the General Sec position is Jiang at 71. But I think there is a good chance he leaves by 2027, the new 7th gen that are going to be elevated to the politburo this year has some people that have a pretty good case and shot at the General sec position.",62c24b8ace5b5c9844b8411040e9f1c333793fed,True,False,,,,,0,1652147766,,0,{},i7zyicx,False,t3_ulil93,False,True,t1_i7zntd2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulil93/lessons_of_ukraine_raise_doubts_about_pla/i7zyicx/,1652147777,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652118966.0,,

That being said they do have the inherent advantage being on the defense. The idea that China's initial bombardment will degrade ROC defenses to the point an amphibious landing will face minimal resistance seems dubious at best, and is an incredibly optimistic scenario. You certainly shouldn't *plan* on it. It won't be D-Day, but there will still be similarities.

The naval disparity is unlikely to be the determining factor in the initial invasion (a blockade afterwards, yes though), ship to ship battles were mostly sidelined by the end of WWII. China's ships will be most effective providing air defense and supporting fires for landing craft, much the same as Normandy. Ships don't hold beachheads, so really everything depends on the ability of a landing force to take and hold an area long enough to allow additional forces to land and advance with strength over defenders.

&gt;However, Taiwan isn’t better off. Troop quality is questionable and morale probably won’t be high. 

As I said before, *these conditions are not static.* PRC would have to act within the year for the assumption to hold, and even then much can change at least on the morale front in a short time. Doctrine wise, yes the ROC are also untested, but their mission is also significantly more simple than China's. You can wargame and study as much as you like, but nothing beats practical institutional experience. Experience PRC does not have, so the opportunities for learning all the way down the chain have been limited.

Which is really the PRC's greatest vulnerability in this scenario. A large scale amphibious landing is **the** most complex combined arms operation a modern military can undertake. Even the US would struggle with the scale and complexity, and as I noted they have extensive, practical, and recent experience in combined arms operations. I don't think it's a bad assumption to believe the PRC takes combined arms training *much* more seriously than Russia apparently has, but nobody should be glib about the difficulty of the task at this scale.

Sure, the PRC might be able to execute this difficult task effectively enough the *very first time* they've ever tried anything remotely like it. We certainly shouldn't plan on them being incompetent. But to what I was addressing in my reply to OP if you're assuming PRC success based on a highly complex operation going off without any glitches and sympathy from the native population after rockets start falling on their neighbors, you're making pretty much the exact same mistakes Russia made invading Ukraine.",5e137daba432950737057e1c9aef6d1ead48aa94,True,False,,,,,0,1652146337,,0,{},i7zv9hk,False,t3_ulil93,False,True,t1_i7z4k8u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulil93/lessons_of_ukraine_raise_doubts_about_pla/i7zv9hk/,1652146354,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652117537.0,,

That warped perspective is then insulated in conspiratorial thinking (no matter how you dress it up). You completely ignore the market incentives which actually finance news organisations to invent a new human nature and magical incentives which justify actions completely inconsistent with reality. If you want to be sceptical of the news rather than just cynical then the basis for that is something like ""_manufacturing consent_"" where the parameters of that influence are clearly defined rather than some kind of wide collusion. Fundamentally the power is still entirely contained within the hands of the viewer though and therefore it is impossible for the media to unilaterally dictate the perspective of the masses - where echo chambers exist we have built them for ourselves.

&gt; As for the USA, on the surface there is division between the two parties and the respective supportive media but when it matters, as with foreign policy, they are always aligned.

But that's obviously not true? Just look at how much Trump shook up US foreign policy on NATO or the Iran nuclear deal or Afghanistan compared to his predecessors.

Key Takeaways  
  
Russian forces did not make any confirmed advances to the southeast or southwest of Izyum on May 9 but are likely attempting to concentrate the forces necessary to resume offensive operations in the coming days.  
Russian forces made marginal gains around Severodonetsk in the past 24 hours.  
Russian forces are likely continuing to amass troops in Belgorod Oblast to stop Ukrainian counterattacks around Kharkiv City from reaching the Ukrainian-Russian border.  
Russian units in Zaporizhia Oblast are regrouping and will likely receive reinforcements from forces previously deployed in Mariupol.  
The Kremlin continues to face severe force mobilization challenges, and ongoing “covert mobilization” efforts are unlikely to generate substantial combat power.  
Russian authorities are likely setting conditions to integrate occupied Ukrainian territories directly into Russia, as opposed to creating proxy “People’s Republics.”",7654e019c18c89ec7aa97e160e0872cccc5e168f,True,False,,,,,0,1652141852,,0,{},i7zlb00,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t3_ulpliz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i7zlb00/,1652141864,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652113052.0,,

I won't try to summarize the book here, but the authors make an argument that there is an overarching bias in our reporting. The book does some simple experiments. Search up in newspaper articles of the time period how often the Indonesian invasion of East Timor was mentioned compared to Pol Pot's Cambodia

&gt; It was a revealing image to see the 70 inches of New York Times news roll about East Timor compared to the 1,175 inches about Cambodia in the period of 1975-79

Was it a coincidence Indonesia was a US ally armed with US guns?  We see this type of thing over and over. If you want to see more examples check out the book.

But tl;dr: there's a bias that isn't necessarily top-down commanded like what we would see in a traditional authoritarian system. It's a more nuanced system of incentives that ultimately results in a propaganda model that is just as, if not more, effective

Perhaps. Then again, the U.S. presence in-country is so large that any Chinese first strike would probably have to target South Korea.

The Australian Navy is small, but modern. It wouldn't make a dramatic difference, but it wouldn't be inconsequential either.

Depending on resistance they could punch south to Barvinkove from a secondary axis from Nova Dmytrivka.

For the Russian forces that were poised around Izyum they're having more success moving west and southwest but that's mostly because those directions aren't defended as heavily as those heading south and southeast, which Russia needs to pinch off the salient. Taking Barvinkove only works if Ukraine reserves can't stop a further drive much deeper to the south to cut the T0510 and T0514 highways that Ukraine needs to resupply their forces inside the salient.
