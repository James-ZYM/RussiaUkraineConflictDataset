The purpose of video you've posted is to bombard you with steam of loopsided information at the same time questions like:  Why did you feel bad about this? Why didn't you cry about that? Why didn't you sanction here?  It's designed to make you feel bad, question your motives and simply muddy the moral waters of the present situation.  Here's how you get past that.

Even assuming all this is true (it has kernnels of truth but it's loopsided) it doesn't change this one simple fact:

**America's past sins do not justify Russia's present sins**

All of the supposed moral outrage in Russia propaganda isn't really outrage about America's humanitarian issuess - If you really look at it, it's jealousy, it's **""Why can't we get away with this too?""**

This line of reasoning might some moral import if we were talking about two siblings - Big brother got away with it, so why can't I?

The reality is America and Russia are not equal moral footing.  America's is a democracy we inherently have greater legitimacy and trust from other liberal democracies because we are built on the same core ideals (freedom, self-goverance, democracy, etc.).  Other democratic governments will implicity trust an American president over an autocratic regime.  And this is as it should be - the world has learned through wisdom of experience you simply cannot trust/allow dictators regarding military intervention.

Now that I've made main point, I'll address some common justifications for the invasion.

Donbass humanitarian crisis - Yes there are ongoing issues in Donbass, our best estimates are that 13-14K have been killed in the conflict over the past 8 years.  **This is tragedy but not it does not justify an invasion that will create a humanitarian crisis at least 10x worse.**

NATO's ""aggressive"" expansion:  NATO does not aggressively expand.  Members choose to join and are allowed in based on a specific set of critia including being a functioning democracy.  There was a time when Russia considered joining NATO, unfortunately that time has past becuase Russia is not a functioning democracy.  Russia only views NATO as aggressive because Putin's reign is foundationally illegitimate - that said NATO has no designs democratic regime change in Russia.

De-Nazification:  Again there are some kernels of truth to this but no need to get into the details.  The solution isn't invasion and ""de-nazification"" that's simply not proportional to the size of the problem.   The way to resolve these kinds of issues is with dipomatic carrots and sticks - money and trade tied to certain anti-corruption policy measures etc.  

Again, all of this is just designed to bombard you more information than you can process to muddy the waters and make morally straight forward situation seem murky.  it's not murky.",f8f66f7ffc19061e7134d53a6cb968d967c0a8e0,True,False,,,,,0,1646177264,,0,{},hyz7shb,False,t3_t4h844,False,True,t3_t4h844,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4h844/please_help_me_to_understand/hyz7shb/,1646177278,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646148464.0,,,,

As you can see the Geneva convention is just one part of the international law of war - it is especially the humanitarian part of the international law of war.
Murders and war crimes do not belong into this conventions content but are covered by different pacts, conventions and contracts.

That's why the Ukraine has already called upon the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Den Haag who started the investigation about Russias bombings in recent days and will publish first decisions next week or so.

I completely understand your point - war crimes are horrible and need to be sanctioned and fought even stronger!

Beyond that, I recommend
1. Determine information collects needs (what do you want to know? Start board, then ask more questions. Then break the answer to those secondary board questions down into yes or no answers.) Remember information is just information.  It can be wrong. 
2. Analyze internal bias - what are you more prone to believe.  Ask friends that are opposite of your thinking to help you.  Develop a system to control your own bias.  
3.  Analyze external Bias - the search for sources is never ending.  You have to investigate each source and determine there bias too.  
4. Information collection (don't ignore satire media sites, they are funny, I support them.  However, many will steal from these sites for ""stories."")
5. Source accuracy's, cycler reporting, and collaboration? You will never know the 150% truth.  But you must make a determination of what is most A. likely, B. Undetermined, or C. unlikely.   These area is where you own bai's comes into play.  Evidence based reporting is essential and you should weigh everything, including motivations of the information report in all three information tiers.
6. Develop competing hypothesis: this is when you develop your different scenarios and determination of what is going on.  Remember, this resembles a trail. 
7. Publish your assessment.  

This is why I recommended the research think tanks. It's not as up to date, but they research deliver quality products I believe.  But remember, they have a bias too.

Citizens are 100% owned and controlled in many ways that allow for societal norms to dictate everyones acceptable level of ""freedom"". Each one of your examples has happened and the result is dispatching the national guard and/or enforcement procedures that do not call for an uparming of civilians. In many cases, as we have seen when those examples happen in the real world, arming civilians runs counter to the general protection of the impacted populace.

&gt; You see, a persons needs and wants are none of yours or anyone else’s business whatsoever.

This is the most ignorant take ever. Wants and needs are always on display and regulated by laws and social norms. That entire mindset of ""live and let live"" is baloney and conjured up by a selfish person who wants to do whatever they want, whenever they want, without taking others into consideration. You think you need a big-ass truck to commute to work by yourself, or you need the loudest motorcycle on the planet. But you dont. Ordinances, laws, mandates, etc. help regulate society and balance out wants vs. needs.

This is not Ukraine, if the police or military were to commit to a forceful takeover of the population your old, fat, redneck uncle isnt going to stop shit with 14 AR-15's.

 They come in different sizes with different blast radii and very high tech.

 These bombs are very expensive and not used except military targets generally.  

 No one can tell from the photo.  Russia has bombs just like we do and has not used them.  If Russia wanted to level Ukraine they can without even nuclear weapons.

 Everyone but China and North Korea (?China really) is terrified of war with Russia. NATO is terrified and well they should be afraid.   Yet they are sending enough weapons to start WWIII.

 Russia appears to want the current government out and a pro-Russia government in.   Having a western border country is very dangerous for any communist country.  

 You don't see China willing to leave Taiwan alone.  Or even Tibet.  

 Those who compare Putin to Hilter are woefully ignorant of Adolph Hitler and the Nazis. 

  They have a Cornwallis problem.  We would be British today had England decided she didn't need us after the war.  Britain can, and has, fought 100 years wars.  King George was great help to us. 


 The current bombing appears blitzkrieg and is very effective. But not the Father of all bombs. 

 While brave,  Zelenskiy has 0 military experience and no military background.  No degree in business or economics and neither does like Putin.  

 While not politic to say the economic devastation wrought by war often ends the wars.

  The economic consequences for Russia and Ukraine will last years.  The west, spending billions we are borrowing to help Ukraine, will also pay to rebuild Ukraine and it will be years to recover. 


Zelenskiy has Sean Penn and military advisors.  

Vladimir has military advisors but Vladimir Putin governs not by social media and how beloved is he (unlike the west).

 Pundits, social media and the UN will not shame him into stopping.

 Russia will stop him.  I think sooner rather than later.  I know I would find a way.

What they did is to take a stace, that's different and does not break with neutrality, since universal. 

What does it mean?
Switzerland acted because of threats to humanity when Russia threatend with nuclear weapons in a war of aggression. 
As a humanitarian country, it does not allow for that and sanctions it. Same would be the case with every other country (US or NATO) if they would do so. 
Its a stance concerning specific policy, not a side in a conflict, which falls under neutrality. 

The historic neutrality is important to keep its intermediary role as a safe haven for diplomacy and international cooperation. A role respected by all countries. Switzerland is and will stay neutral. It does not move or judge, thats not its purpose or role. That's why it hits hard, if Switzerland the old, heavy, wise Mountain of neutral silence starts to speek. 

So Switzerland even officially taking a stance is already a huge deal historically. Not even Hitler got the ""threat to humanity"" stance, afaik. 
So it still a action of immense gravity/gravitas and basically shows how immensly Putin fucked up. 

For people who are not used to the concept of Swiss political neutrality, the concept might seem like splitting hairs, moral ignorance, opportunism etc. but its not. 
Quite the opposite, Neutrality is a tradition for at least 500 years, based on principals of at least 704 years (1318 CE). 
Principals not just thrown aside due to the next despote in the world coming to power and others opposing. There will always be despotes as long as power itself is not shared and secured. (Looking at you USA, China, Brazil, Israel etc) It's law of nature concerning power/infliuence and humans with our limited experience and perception ans subjective values.

Uses modifying language, like ""*potential* genocide."" Also shifts into angry tones to put the viewer into a defensive stance when blaming the audience of not caring about other conflicts.

But lets address some points:

He's saying ""Ukraine isn't a problem""

But then he also says ""you can't care about this issue if you didn't care about these other issues.""

How can a situation be both ""not a problem"" and ""a problem, but you aren't allowed to care if you didn't care about these other problems."" It's a classic manipulation tactic.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, he tips his hand on how he doesn't view Ukrainians as people. He frames the problem as ""NATO is expanding towards Russia's border."" What about Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania (via kaliningrad), Poland (via Koliningrad)? He doesn't seem to have a problem with those NATO borders?

Yet Rus gov't demands that NATO prohibit Ukraine from ever joining, and it's NATOs fault for not doing this and preventing escalation. Can't Ukraine just promise not to join? Of course they can, but they don't want to promise this, because they know Russia is territorial.

Why can't a free, independent, and sovereign state make it's own choice? This isn't NATO vs Russia with Ukraine in the middle, it's Ukraine vs Russia, with NATO being a legitimate option for Ukraine to guarantee independence. Ukraine and Russia have deep cultural roots together, and the former's growing success under democratic elections is a huge threat to the current Russian regime.

Why is it a threat? Look at the testimonials of the surrendering 18 and 19 year old Russian conscripts. ""I have family in Ukraine."" ""I vacation in Ukraine."" Ukraine's democracy will inevitably spread it's ideals through the familial and cultural ties between the two countries, and this is unacceptable. Ukraine must not be allowed to stay independent, and NATO membership would guarantee this indefinitely.

But that's somehow NATOs fault, because they're ""expansionist"" (but only when it comes to Ukraine, of course.)",2de2a58408a8501ab4172e462eac9c5fd2621445,True,False,,,,,0,1646167886,,0,{},hyyjyq8,False,t3_t4h844,False,True,t3_t4h844,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4h844/please_help_me_to_understand/hyyjyq8/,1646167898,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646139086.0,,,,

People with fucking 4th grade physics knowledge can correct the horrible mess that you just posted.    

This is like the peak reddit comment. 

First off, oxygen doesn't get set on fire, fuel is set on fire, and consumes oxygen as it burns, since that is what the process of burning is.      

Second 
&gt;to really hot temperatures which creates a vacuum that sucks oxygen out of the air.    
I'm not quite sure where to start on how dumb that statement is, but I'll try.      
The explosions don't create a vacuum, they create the opposite, high pressure. The vacuum doesn't suck the oxygen out of the air, it's the fuel burning that sucks the oxygen out of the air, because that's what burning is.     
You're right though, it can rupture lungs, not just people's either, but so can most large explosions.

If they changed the law tomorrow on gun legislation, and required everyone to surrender their firearms before a certain date, then they can take your firearms by force after that date. The police do this already with any contraband items. It doesn't mean there is a 'conflict'. 

For example, if you were a drug dealer the police could storm your house by force in the search of drugs. Nobody calls that a 'conflict'.

I think you are underestimating the control the government has.

They are semi-automatic, meaning you pull the trigger one time and one bullet is fired. If you continue to hold the trigger down, it does nothing. This is exactly the same as a pistol, a non-bolt action rifle, and a crossbow for that matter.

I’d say the threat of being invaded or oppressive government activities within one’s own country are reason for a license. Ukraine was lucky that its government
1. Had enough firearms with adequate ammunition in the right places at the right times (even tho most of those people had never used that type of gun if any gun at all, making them arguably more dangerous to their own unit than the enemy) 
2. Were able to assemble at all to organize such an activity, and change the law. (Thankfully they were facing what now seems to be a very inept Russian army with piss poor planning)

If anything, the situation in Ukraine proves exactly the point I’m making. Many Americans are trained on many types of guns, and can use them safely and effectively. Any crime committed with a firearm could just as easily be committed with a knife or a load of fertilizer. Plus, we have them at our immediate disposal with ammo - conveniently enough, also chambered for NATO rounds (e.g. 5.56)",729e00f7eb6942b1f99694bf140f3d79a2ce5987,True,False,,,,,0,1646160608,,0,{},hyy115m,True,t3_t4au2o,False,True,t1_hyxhqw9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4au2o/for_those_with_gun_control_on_their_minds/hyy115m/,1646160623,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646131808.0,,,,

&gt;plenty of us have enough ammo to last a long, long time.

More than the US government? How many rounds of ammunition do you think the average firearms owner has? Enough for a session or two at the range is my guess. Sure, some will have more. But some will have less too.

&gt;Remember, when discussing citizenry vrs the government or an occupying force, we're not talking about a traditional pitched battle.

But without the government on your side, your already at a loss. They control your utilities and your water. Your food supply. Your communication. Your healthcare and medicine. Once these supplies run out and people get desperate, they will give in to the government demands.

I think you're talking about the Quad alliance. I'm not very well informed on that because it's been on and off, at least in terms of news coverage. But with China looking like the heir to the Soviet Union's throne as the primary communist superpower, I suspect it's only a matter of time before India is forced to choose a side. India could afford to be non-aligned after the Cold War because neither the US nor the Soviet Union posed an immediate threat. China does.

But I really don't think India can let Russia go and form an alliance that has the US in it without having an independent defence industry. That's why it's so hard to predict what will happen if an isolated Russia allies itself with China. 

We don't have very many options apart from Russia. For example, we don't buy US fighters for our air force because the US has a history of heavily conditional arms deals. India can't risk having its equipment rendered inoperable in a war (against two nuclear-armed nations) because the US decides to stop the sale of spare parts and so on. In contrast, Russia does not care how Russian hardware is used after it has been sold.

As an Indian, this invasion snowballing into something worse that forces Russia to side with China is a harrowing prospect. Explicit support for Russia could invite retaliation (economic, political, or otherwise) from the West. Angering Russia and allowing it to get into bed with the Chinese could spell disaster for our armed forces.

Ukraine is “privileged” by their location and living in modern continent. Not as people.

Iraq and countries around it didn’t care and didn’t have so much ability to get it out what is happening there.

Also US does have free speech and are free to some degree and they don’t get shot for voicing other opinion.
In Russia they do not have that luck.
We here in Europe know very well what happens to you when Russia takes over and it is not pretty.

That is another reason for bigger emotional response.

Well for these reasons:

Neighbours to Ukraine share similar language and culture. We are called Slavic. Other countries have similar values and are democratic.
They are people like us and so we kind of take it personal.  

We don’t know much about Iraq unfortunately. It’s not because their lives are less valued.
They have different religion and thinking. And often have conflicts with other countries and it’s not like there are many people from Iraq to relate to. We have Ukrainians everywhere around Europe.

As horrible as it is that is the fact.

Europe stood up because Ukraine are our neighbours. Countries here are more united because we can simply relate more.
It’s different because we can see this first hand.

Russia betrayed and tried to occupy Poland, Slovakia Czech Republic among other countries and some of them they succeeded to influence.

We already had some sort of negative feelings towards Russia as it was because of history. Wasn’t hatred however dislike to some degree have been there.

What happened to Iraq was horrible and doesn’t mean Iraq people are valued less or what US did was ok.

And on a pure basic it is the same.

Russia could have intervened much earlier, when the Euromaidan protests happened. 

I truly believe that you are deluded to some extent. Shoud Ukraine sacrifice the future of it's people just to prevent a war? Should Ukraine be a ""buffer"" between Russia and NATO?

Ukraine is independent and has the right to decide what to do with itself, what alliances to have and what unions to enter. Sometimes, disputes can only be resolved this way because some of the current leaders didn't evolve from the stage of ""I'll bash your head in if you don't do my bidding"". Look at revolutions, many were bloody and painful.

Ther could have been other solutions besides the invasion.

I don't think anyone this day touts America as the hero for having invaded Irak and Afghanistan. The common consensus is that the whole thing was a disaster. 

The world is deciding of being patriotic because Ukraine is part of Europe and because Ukrainians have touched the emotions of millions. They have made a stand to defend their home and they never threatened anyone. Saddam on the other hand threatened a lot, massacred his own people and was very much hated by everyone.

How many geniuses and poor people are there out there with limitless potential out there that end up living in poverty because they weren't born to white collar parents to teach them how to harness it? How many people out there could've been great but are limited by anxiety or other mental health issues that could've been treated but weren't because of lack of funds or because they were born in a country where mental health services are shite? 

Brain chips completely bridge that gap. The systemic and cultural issues that make the rich richer and the poor poorer will become far less of an issue as technology like that progresses. 

So whether or not Musk realizes it or not he is saving the poor rather than destroying them and even if he does his best to maintain the class divide by jacking up prices etc. once that technology exists it is only a matter of time before it is utilized by the masses. It's a door that can never be shut once it opens. 

I can understand socialists hating on, say, Disney. They make some great movies but in the end that does not justify their greed and elitism - they are just movies. But Musk's technology?

A new world is born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a high price, yes, through the tragic events of the virtual civil war, because now brothers separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies are still shooting at each other - but Ukraine will no longer be like anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to consolidate for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants - for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.


Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin assumed - without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to put pressure on us in the West, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to accept the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to give up your history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is real Russia,"" or powerlessly grind your teeth, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" It would be more and more difficult to return Ukraine, that is, to turn it back to Russia, every decade - transcoding, derusification of Russians and setting up against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians, would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine was consolidated, its return to Russia would be impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.


Now there is no problem - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be eliminated, but it will be rebuilt, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be solved after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia is put. In any case, the period of split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
And this is where the second dimension of the coming new era begins - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant about it, although deep down he must confess to himself that it could not have been otherwise.

Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would abandon Kiev? Is it that the Russians will always be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe unites, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control over European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and gather a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. Swing at Russian lands after that is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, much less Europe alone, had no strength to keep in its sphere of influence, much less take Ukraine. In order not to understand this, you had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it didn't work should have become clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear that Russia is returning.


Now the West is trying to punish Russia for returning, for not justified its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing it to expand the western space to the east. In an effort to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are vital for us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who govern the West. No Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, increasing the degree of confrontation costs - and the main ones are not economic at all.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German European integration project does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it can't be successful because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But obtaining autonomy is also necessary for Europe for another reason - in case the States moves to self-isolation (as a result of increasing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focuses on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, in which the Anglo-Saxons draw Europe, deprives Europeans of even chances of independence - not to mention the fact that Europe is trying to impose a break with China in the same way. If now the Atlantists rejoice that the ""Russian threat"" will rally the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot help but understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new Iron Curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a pen for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is over anyway - but various options for its future are still possible.
Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are increasingly emerging through the spreading cover of globalization in Anglo-Saxon. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not able to rally against Russia except the West. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, it is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlantists, it is Russia's return to its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West is leading the world order, much less establishing the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally completed. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers by forces, of course, together with the West (one or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",30ecec98cec1ba28a690ba0fc5314a03c47fdb3b,True,False,,,,,0,1646141599,,0,{},hywqyed,True,t3_t3j1kz,False,True,t1_hysjm30,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t3j1kz/russian_propaganda_press_agency_ria_prematurely/hywqyed/,1646141610,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1646112799.0,,,,

This understandably upset them and some tried to just flee with the rest but the border guards tried to uphold the law. 

Because they were few and could easily be overrun (e.g. failing to do their job) they were using excessive force.

&gt; KYIV/MOSCOW, Feb 28 - Russia&amp;#039;s political and economic isolation deepened on Monday as its forces met stiff resistance in Ukraine&amp;#039;s capital and other cities in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.President Vladimir Putin put Russia&amp;#039;s nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western-led reprisals for his war on Ukraine, which said it had repelled Russian ground forces&amp;#039; attempts to capture urban centres.

&gt; Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a &amp;quot;Special operation&amp;quot; that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour&amp;#039;s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

&gt; Japan said it had been asked to join in measures blocking Russia from SWIFT, and was also considering imposing sanctions against some individuals in Belarus, a key staging area for the Russian invasion.

The short summary is that NATO keeps expanding and it’s unacceptable to Russia if Ukraine joins NATO. I remember previously Putin asked NATO to sign an agreement and promise not to accept Ukraine into NATO, but Putin didn’t get it. Therefore, he doesn't really have any option except starting a war.   


EU countries like Germany and France actually don't want Ukraine because they know Russia wouldn't accept it. That's why they didn't want to help Ukraine in the beginning of the war. However, US want this war to come because it will undermine the relationship between EU and Russia, which is good for US.   


So, who wins, who lose?  
\- US is the biggest winner. Germany and France wanted to make EU independent from US. They were relatively close to Russia previously, but now they have to rely on US again.

I am not saying Ukraine is trying to deceive everyone, and I am still 100% backing them, but dont believe every last thing you see from any politician or media outlet.

As to why I say actual kills are probably lower, during WW II, as an example, US airmen often claimed to have shot down as many as 4-5 times the amount of aircraft that were reported as lost by the Japanese during the same battle, which was Guadalcanal btw. And Japan had a similar issue, but to a lesser extent. Fog of war means you cant see every last opponent crash into the ground or blow up because another opponent is shooting at you or you are shooting them. Meaning, more often than not, an aircraft or tank is badly damaged, but not a total loss and manages to limp away.

Even if he takes Ukraine, which, I don't think he will at this point without turning it into glass, which I don't think will happen without international intervention, he still has his economy tanking. He has his people marching on him, even under the risk of imprisonment. He's never had that really before. He has political opponents that are more popular than him locked away. He has his Oligarchs coming out. Russian stars coming out against the war.  Mix that with what seems to be almost a delusional man, he's going to start lashing out more and more, harsher and harsher.

If you had any doubt just look at the expression on his generals faces that were sitting 20 feet away from Putin when he announced special alert with his nuclear weapons. He also made Macron sit 20 feet away …he has become mentally unstable….furthermore Russia’s  economy when start defaulting in short order …and will become completely insolvent. We froze the governments reserve funds today and froze the central bank and block swift. It take roughly 20 billion dollars a day to fund Putin offensive a day. And if that was not bad enough for the Russians apparently Anonymous has promised to have at it on March 3rd. This is a clear case of good vs evil and the majority of the planet knows this and is behind defeating Putin. Putin must fail.

If the USA doesn't fight Russia directly, how does this go? My uneducated arm-chair general opinion. Russians do not succeed in regime changing Kiev, but they do hold a line in the east, somewhat deeper into Ukraine than the old Donetsk/Luhanks/Crimea areas they held before.  This line ends up militarized, like old East/West Germany with large armies on each side. The remainder of Ukraine ends up in NATO, but NATO/USA doesn't move to try to retake Crimea, anything like this.
