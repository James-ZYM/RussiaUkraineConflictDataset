[],False,,Macketter,,,[],,,,text,t2_8oxkh3j,False,False,"&gt;I would also argue that if we can believe Biden’s commitment to not send troops to Ukraine, we can reasonably believe his commitment to intervene if Taiwan is invaded. Why say you wouldn’t intervene in Ukraine and not say the same about Taiwan if both situations have equal merit as geopolitical concerns? The answer is that they simply aren’t the same type of concerns. I think Biden chose to be honest about this reality rather than be strategically ambiguous about US intervention in both cases. I would argue this was the right move given that Putin has shown he’s a less rational actor, making a nuclear exchange in response to intervention more likely. Whereas, Xi is a slightly more rational actor as evidenced by China’s middle of the road response to Russia’s invasion. China is simply not willing to go all in when they have major economic interest in Western markets. They can see how much Putin lost from making this move. The U.S. is also willing to go further on Taiwan as evidenced by a U.S. Navy carrier showing force by rolling right through the Taiwan Strait.

I don't think Biden said he won't intervene in Ukraine because he is already intervening. It is just that he said he won't send in US troops. This is distinguishable from him saying he will intervene in Taiwan because that does not necessarily mean military intervention. 

What strikes me the most is in one of his press event he said he will sanction Russia but at the same time picked options that have the least cost to the US. This indicated to me that he is not willing to pay too much political capital and have more domestic concerns. He would not risk the negative sentiment of military intervention if it have the chance to get many Americans killed.",8882942a402b659fa4a403639dee912cbdc4b6d9,True,False,,,,,0,1646178214,,0,{},hyz9zr8,False,t3_t48i49,False,True,t1_hyxvexw,/r/geopolitics/comments/t48i49/how_would_china_survive_an_invasion_of_taiwan_if/hyz9zr8/,1646178225,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646149414.0,

Besides, Ukraine is a very strategic country as a it can contain Russia in the Black Sea, has a very large agricultural field, an important population compared to European countries and a huge geography.

Finally, European leaders certainly want to make Russia pay for its arrogance over the years. The fact that Putin just decided to invade Ukraine despite numerous talks with European leaders in the previous days cleary make Ukraine a vital and essential security matter for Europe.

I share the same thoughts on a Russia collapse and the potential fallout of such an event. The main reason being Putin, He is not Gorbachev in the worst way imaginable. Putin has no where to go outside of Russia, and after solidifying power for over 20 years his power is absolute internally with the elites. There is a better chance massive protests would end in a slew of massive gulags than regime change. Anything else ends in Putin's death( not exile or retirement). That means nothing can be discounted with a Putin that is cornered, and could become unpredictable at the worst, and assuredly alot more crueler (ala Kim's in North Korea).

The West Unites stronger

And yet, The benefits out way the risks for the U.S and the West in containing Russia. The military buildup has already begun in Europe, and a capable Europe would be able to not only provide it's own security but help in another key strategic sphere, The Middle East. With this, Europe secures its energy needs and lessens the load for the U.S. Who's full attention and majority of resources will be spent in Asia. Europe's belief in the separation of energy and security has officially become debunked. They will not be making this mistake again.

Germany

Germany has just entered the playing field( something I never expected in my lifetime) and I cannot understate how major this will be on a geopolitical scale. With the largest economy and most political influence in Europe, Germany has the power to change the projections of the world order. The biggest benefit this time for the U.S is that Germany is an absolute dependent Ally(this is no slight to Germany or Europe). Germany and the U.S hold to the same values in the Liberal Order, the U.S just happens to have the capability to take the leading role which will benefit both. Unlike France I tend to believe Germany will become an ally more akin to the U.K, inseparable and in lock step together.

Russia Future

There were two scenario's I though possible for Russia in the future. An acceptance of and joining of the West, or a neutral player beaten down by it's continued fall into a middling power. Putin is making a last gambit to secure a sphere of influence in a closely coming Bi polar order. While the chances of him achieving this are low there is still a small chance now instead of a zero chance in say a decade. Now with a vastly stronger response from the west, I'd lower those chances to almost zero. Russia will be a lot more dangerous to the world itself until Putin has left it.",2e873565a107e5bcfcd203d979f1ccceeaef43c8,True,False,,,,,0,1646172939,,0,{},hyyx49w,False,t3_t4apy8,False,True,t1_hyxrkdx,/r/geopolitics/comments/t4apy8/the_return_of_containment_how_the_west_can/hyyx49w/,1646172955,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646144139.0,

&gt;You're falling for confirmation bias, anything Dugin espoused was either being done for a long time already (fuelling instability abroad), or something that any Russian leader would be doing anyway (trying to increase their influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia).

Quite possible and I also appreciate the causation/correlation confusion thats suggested in the piece.  I still think its possible to glean some measure of insight into Putin's foreign policy from Dugins writing - not as a suggestion of influence but because he has at a minimum expressly articulated certain ideas.  I think this is indisputable and is at this point evidenced by recent developments.  Whether Dugins influence is overstated or these ideas are part of a more generally understood Russian foreign policy vision is up for debate.  But because he hasn't predicted the actions of Russia in their totality is not grounds for saying that he has had zero influence on Russian foreign policy, especially when some of what he has written has played out in reality.

I get the thinking in the piece that we shouldn't give outsize influence to the guy because it actually amplifies some pretty f'd up ideas, but its probably not prudent to dismiss these same ideas as the ramblings of some crackpot seeing as there is at the very least some *correlation.*

On the other hand if  a good number of semi intelligent people with a crazy idea start to apply that idea,  they should still notice after a while that it's not at all working as intended.     
I mean if Putin and his guys want to turn the world back to the  19th century he should release that in  his curent position, he is more of a Napoleon the III.     

And  I would say  that Russia can try to build a new world for themselves internally.  But... they dragged another country into that.  Russia by itself of course unique in the world.    
But they are basically a petro state with a strong military financed by that and currently in a spiral of nationalistic and spiritual  conservatism intellectually. but that is only sustainable for the current ruling class for as long as  the exports of raw materials and energy are running.   


So one way or another they  would face a potential economic downterm in 15 years,  lightly a time  horizon Putin is not really interested in as much as a 69 year old.      


And instead of  diversifying the economy something that would cost the current elites and oligarch political power.  They try to extend it  for a maybe  5 years more and a larger  cake to share while gobbling up  Ukraine as that would not rock the elites boat and they would all mostly remain relevant.  

So  what Russia builds  is basically what the Russian elites build to benefit from.  without consideration if it's also good for the common people to some extend as is done in western  democracy's.

There are two major benefits for Russia if they succeed in taking Ukraine. They cut the area going into Russia down substantially by any future military threats, especially from NATO. They also push Moscow further from the lines where any war would begin. Strategically, the terrain benefit is a large factor of taking Ukraine back. 

However, the biggest reason is because Ukraine has substantial fuel resources that could heavily impact Russia with the EU and even Western markets. The only reason it hasn't yet is because Ukraine doesn't have the funds to properly harvest it. This is why Russia took Crimea in 2014, because there is a large amount of resources there as well. It's also why Ukraine created a dam to prevent water from flowing to Crimea in hopes to kill their ability to properly harvest, but that's another topic. (Russia blew up this dam a couple days ago for a reason)

Ultimately, if Ukraine was to move forward with harvesting their natural resources eventually, and joining Nato preventing Russia from doing anything about it, they would become a very impactful option for EU to stop relying on Russia for their oil and invest in Ukraine.

Multiple theorists, writers and scholars in the West have raised the potential dangers of enlarging both the EU and NATO. I do think the West knew that it was pushing Russia into a standoff but given the frantic and slightly chaotic European response to this situation, I don't think they expected the ferocity of Russia's response.

Did I say it was a fringe opinion?

I want to ask you a question, is an economic policy dictated by Generals or least of all IR professors.? Yes, politicians are stupid, because they don't listen to academics, but people with money.

Can you guarantee that Putin won't be doing this if NATO was still West Germany?  No, no one can.

It is even more so with the EU.  I get the impression that you think the US decides all things in Europe. From 2001-2014, the US had been preoccupied with the Middle East.

Secondly, for Ukraine its not just about foreign relations, it goes at the core of their identity. Are they part of the European vs Russian sphere of influence?

&gt;Its key policies have always been dictated by a stronger power.

[This is the convoluted identity of Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/World-War-I-and-the-struggle-for-independence). Because of this, key decisions (ie the EU) are always controversial. You might discount democracy like many people here, but larger social and economic forces are stronger than one individual leader like Putin. Putin can't just add $5000 to Russia's per capita GDP overnight.

In 1990, Poland's per capita GDP was the same as Ukraine and only half that of Russia. Now it's US$ 15000 for Poland vs US$4000 for Ukraine vs US$ 10000 for Russia in 2021.  Most of the maids, gardeners, cooks etc in Poland are Ukrainian. And last year, Romania and Bulgaria's per capita GDP also surpassed Russia's.  Because of this, support for EU in Eastern Ukraine has been rising steadily. In 2014 ,about 70% rejected EU membership, now its 45%.

Stronger is a relative word.  For military types that dominate the discussion about geopolitics yes Russia is strong because it can flatten a city.  But it is losing the economic battle. Russia is like the Mongol Empire, its not built on any strong economic foundation.

I took a course in Russian History, and I don't even know much about the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth.

It might suffer for decades from this invasion

Acknowledged all this is unfair to Ukraine.  But this is hardly one nation attacking another without historical baggage.  Worst case scenario for Ukraine: Russia tries to take all its real estate on Black Sea, including Odessa.  

Not logical that Russia wants to take central/west Ukraine; why would it want to saddle itself with governing a bunch of people who want freedom and separation?  Yes Russia abhors the increased links between Ukraine and the West, but it probably can't block that over the long term.

They can mobilise millions of people for or against the state (and they have done so numerous times in history) because they command religious sentiments.

But the odds are still poor against Ukraine if Russia utilizes its full potential, which seems they will be doing that since they used the negotiations in order to regroup the army and rethink their strategy.

If Russia keeps advancing from the south and take control of the Dnieper they would part Ukraine in two, probably cutting communications and the posibility of any troops in western Ukraine of assisting Kiev. Plus they would be able to help with the encirclement of Kiev from the south.

I still don't see how they'll be able to maintain a puppet regime though, it seems almost impossible with the level of insurgency and Russia's economy completely falling. 
But if you read reddit you would think Ukraine is winning and it's only a matter of day till they completely retreat. Some are even talking about unconditional surrender and forcing them to give up all their nukes. Of course all of that is complete fantasy and it's mostly 14 year old american kids on r/worldnews repeating that, but those people are for a rude awakement if indeed Ukraine falls.

It is also true that Russia has already lost in the sense that there's no possible way in which they emerge stronger after this. They will have united all of Europe after NATO and they will be themselves completely dependant on China to the point of almost being to China what Belarus is to Russia.

I'm even doubting that Russia's goal right now is still install a puppet government, I think they're aware the chances for that have failed and they know there's no way they can afford that.

[],False,,gerardus-aelius,,,[],,,,text,t2_2r7m0u2x,False,False,"The idea of MAD stems from the idea that nuclear weapons are mainly a deterrent to all out warfare between superpowers - basically if you beat me in a war and I have nukes, you didn’t really beat me because now I can just end it all for both of us (and likely everyone else depending on which 2 nuclear powers were referring to). 

The use of nukes offensively is different, however if Russia decided to nuke Poland it would be met instantly with retaliatory strikes from the US France &amp; UK. Part of the reason for this is that we are alerted and can see where a nuclear weapon is launched from, and we can make guesses about where it is headed, but we don’t have ironclad certainty about the target of the missile. Any hesitation means that a nuclear power could miss its opportunity to retaliate and be wiped off the face of the planet. N.b. That this doesn’t preclude the use of non-missile nuclear weapons, but it’s my understanding that the vast majority of modern nuclear weapons are missile based and aren’t dropped from bombers.

I think you have a point though that this is all theoretical, and it’s what most alliances have agreed upon, but it’s never been tested. FWIW I very seriously doubt that it ever will be tested. The only place I could potentially see anything nuclear happening is in the event of a major war between India and Pakistan, but even those two countries have some level of security and support from larger powers that would work tirelessly to stop nuclear conflict.

It would be a massive and unprecedented risk to take for Russia to use nuclear weapons against NATO though. One that I can’t imagine would get off the ground as even the fighting in Ukraine has caused (reportedly) a huge loss of support for Putin even among the elites he surrounds himself with. I think the world is generally dramatically more strongly against war and carnage now than it ever has been because we can see it in real time, very clearly and very explicitly. It’s very real and tangible to even the furthest people from the fight due to the internet and media. I could be wrong though as I’m certainly not an expert on foreign policy or military doctrine, but just what I’ve observed.",f67ff56f3c4df9fd8a87952a325cc75dd309506f,True,False,,,,,0,1646161434,,0,{},hyy36pz,False,t3_t3x39p,False,True,t3_t3x39p,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3x39p/does_mutually_assured_destruction_really_exist/hyy36pz/,1646161449,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646132634.0,

1. What ramifications will this have on the future structure of Myanmar? If a powerful rebel-state is able to achieve independence across a large region such as this, would it force a push towards federalisation?
2. International observers will likely be worried about the impact this will have on the narcotics trade in the region, from which Wa derives its income.

Think about his attempt to leave Afghanistan in order to free up military resources to combat the rise of China - or Sec of State Antony Blinken doing work with the QUAD (like an Indo-Pacific NATO but not legally binding and not NATO). 

I would also argue that if we can believe Biden’s commitment to not send troops to Ukraine, we can reasonably believe his commitment to intervene if Taiwan is invaded. Why say you wouldn’t intervene in Ukraine and not say the same about Taiwan if both situations have equal merit as geopolitical concerns? The answer is that they simply aren’t the same type of concerns. I think Biden chose to be honest about this reality rather than be strategically ambiguous about US intervention in both cases. I would argue this was the right move given that Putin has shown he’s a less rational actor, making a nuclear exchange in response to intervention more likely. Whereas, Xi is a slightly more rational actor as evidenced by China’s middle of the road response to Russia’s invasion. China is simply not willing to go all in when they have major economic interest in Western markets. They can see how much Putin lost from making this move. The U.S. is also willing to go further on Taiwan as evidenced by a U.S. Navy carrier showing force by rolling right through the Taiwan Strait. 

An invasion of Taiwan - unlike a possible invasion of NATO countries by Russia - wouldn’t automatically trigger major nuclear powers to get involved since there are no binding agreements between Japan, Taiwan, India, Australia and the US to universally engage if Taiwan gets merked. But it does automatically involve the U.S alone because any successful Chinese invasion would mean preemptively striking U.S military bases in the region - killing thousands of American service members. 

Taiwan is more the case of a U.S. obligation with shared concerns by Japan and South Korea who fear Chinese/NK aggression.

Dugin is certainly in Putin's toolbox but he's not into his culty religious craziness. 

From [this](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/geopolitics-russia-mackinder-eurasia-heartland-dugin-ukraine-eurasianism-manifest-destiny-putin/):

&gt;Of course, it went without saying in Dugin’s view that the USSR must be put back together; Georgia must be dismembered and Ukraine annexed: “Ukraine, as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions, represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia.” Azerbaijan, though, could be given away to Iran in exchange for a “Moscow–Tehran axis.” Finland could be added to the Russian province of Murmansk, while Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece would join Russia as an Orthodox “Third Rome” or Russian South.  
&gt;  
&gt;The other thing the book gives short shrift to, despite Dugin’s erudite style and exhaustive presentation, was exactly why Russia needed an empire. Russian thinkers, from Alexander Herzen to Andrey Sakharov, have been adamant that the empire is the primary culprit for Russia’s eternal backwardness. Few would say that modern-day Russia’s dysfunction and lack of status and influence commensurate with its ambitions on the global stage are due to any deficiency in size — it is, after all, still geographically the largest country in the world, despite losing 14 post-Soviet territories. Additionally, Russia’s land-based civilization was not just a strategic opponent of sea-based powers, but culturally and civilizationally anomalous, inherently more hierarchical and authoritarian than the more mercantile and democratic Atlantic world. Dugin argued that empire was the only way to stop the march of liberalism, which was antithetical to Russia’s value system.  
  
The influence of Foundations was profound if measured by book sales; but even more profound if measured by the true yardstick of the scribbler: plagiarism. Dugin’s ideas became a “virus,” as he put it. They were reprinted in dozens of similar manuals and textbooks, all of which devoted themselves to the theories of Mackinder, Haushofer, and others. Bookstores in Russia began to have a “Geopolitics” section; the Duma formed a “Geopolitics” committee stacked with deputies from arch-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s so-called Liberal Democratic Party. Boris Berezovsky, influential oligarch and behind-the-scenes power broker, ended an appearance on the Hero of the Day television chat show in 1998 with the statement “I just want to say one more thing: geopolitics is the destiny of Russia.”  
  
Geopolitics was like “open source computer software,” as Dugin put it. He wrote the program, and everyone copied it.",a768c06ba2522d117c37ea0a7557ab1bf23fa7c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646158059,,0,{},hyxud26,False,t3_t488qo,False,True,t3_t488qo,/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hyxud26/,1646158072,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646129259.0,

Most likely Russia as a nation will collapse with this much pressure (I strongly doubt China will bail them out - they have their own internal problems).  Russia's collapse will spread to her allies that depend on her.  Also, Russia is keeping several regions at the moment with force, so those regions may rebel and try to break away.  If NATO stays on the sideline and just watch things burn like they did in Arab Spring, we are going to have similar chaos and destruction, only much larger in scale, with nuclear arms.

Apparently you have not put enough effort into studying this issue.  
The most important answer: geography.  
The Baltic countries are tiny states, the territory of which Russia controls from three sides. They do not pose a threat, the same goes for Sweden and Finland.  
Ukraine is the largest country in Europe (except Russia).  
In Romania, there are Mk-41 launchers, which are also capable of launching cruise missiles. If Ukarina is friendly to NATO, its territory can be used for the transit flight of cruise missiles. And then from Kharkov to Moscow 7 minutes flight. The Russian military considers this a threat to national security.

Sure, and I recognize that this contrasts with the definition of a bloackade as an act of war being well established in international law.  That being said, Putin showed no compunction about putting hits out on US soldiers in Syria and Afghanistan, was caught red-handed, and yet America has fired not one bullet back at him in response.  Lots of things are acts of war, but some things are bigger acts than others.

So the other options to consider are if this was a unique opportunity to achieve these goals with potential factors being COVID, European reliance on Russian energy (not guaranteed to be the case for evermore if serious steps to tackle climate change are taken) as well as Russian military advantage ever dwindling.

Or whether this was about shoring up his domestic situation with the amount of COVID deaths that Russia has had, the generally poor economic situation and general discontent with his leadership on the upswing (things like Navalny don’t happen in a vacuum). Seems like a move such as this would be similar to what he’s done before in order to make it look like the west is against Russia and he is standing up them. A rally around the flag type of effect.

This guy again will have problems keeping power unless he brings some economic normalcy back. The cycle can go on until a stable leadership manages to appear.

I expect that ill will between Brussels and Moscow will remain for some years and no major diplomatic advance will come from that. In this phase, NATO could expand to as much as it wants. Some will even suggest to make NATO a global thing. Specially aiming this at Asia. The UK will probably be a country rally around this point given the Global Britain band it wants to promote. I am not sure others countries will agree with this though.

Russia's behavior vis-a-vis Europe will probably be similar to how the Russian Empire acted towards European powers after the Crimean war. You will hardly see anything about Russia because Moscow will keep a low profile. A good gauge for that is if Russia simply show no hurry to have its Council of Europe suspension rescinded.

On the economics realm, I think Russia will try to pivot hard its economy towards Asia. Moscow will specially court China, South Asian countries and countries in ASEAN as these countries were really not hard on Russia with their communiqués about this war to the consternation of Washington that pressured them to be harder on Moscow.The main reason these countries acted like that is probably because don't really care that much about a war in Europe, although they may write harsher opinions on Moscow in the coming weeks.

Some years from now, a major economy in the EU will probably try to lend a hand to Moscow again. Moscow probably will accept, but their enthusiasm about it depends on their success on their projects towards Asia.

This is all just a guess though.

Putin could resign tomorrow if his inner circle makes it clear to him he lost support.

He could die of a stroke today.

Countries in Europe could show they are way above ill will and rally towards bringing Russia completely in Europe and work to improve Russia's economy on day 1.

Russia could perhaps not really face that big of a crisis if talks give something to everyone although it surely looks like it will now.

But unfortunately, Palestine has no leverage and Israel has no incentive at the moment to let up on expanding their settlements. At this rate, Israel will slowly and methodically take over, one neighborhood at a time and eviscerate Palestinian identity in the region. Unless western countries step in to punish Israel and stop sending so much aid (especially military aid), Israel really has no reason to negotiate.

The question is given that Putin's actions have mirrored some prescriptions the book has provided, is it the case that the book is the causal influence or is it the case that the same Russian nationalist ideals that have existed even prior to Dugin's writing that are broadly influencing Putin have also influenced Dugin's writing (active measures for example were in use by Putin, well before Dugin suggested it, it just has become more effective with social media and online media).

[],False,,thebigmanhastherock,,,[],,,,text,t2_gste2ri,False,False,"I personally do think his worldview is a large influence on Putin and many in the Russian military. With that being said Dugin's influence falls apart when you look east. Dugin believes that China is a major threat to Russia and believes that Russia should chip away at Chinese controlled territory, especially in the steppe region. If there ever was an attempt to go by this advise it failed when countries like Vietnam were far less receptive to Russian overtures than Dugin expected. 

I think people downplay Dugin as an influence, but to me it's really clear that he is indeed an influence, Foundations of Geopolitics is widely read in certain influential circles in Russia. This book purposefully does not include some of Dugin's more ridiculous theories, it's much more pragmatic and seems to have been well received by some. Putin seems to clearly take some influence from it, especially when you pay attention to some of the rhetoric Putin uses. 

With that being said these ideas are not new. Liberalism has long been seen as a threat to Russia and after the fall of the USSR that time period of chaos and decline really highlighted some of the dangers of liberalism in the minds of many powerful Russians. It could be that Dugin and Putin observed the same events and have similar interpretations of them. This idea far predates even this though, as the idea that ""Russia is different"" than western Europe and has its own character that is not predisposed to Western European values existed strongly in the time of the Czars. So in a lot of ways Dugin himself as far as his underlying philosophy is nothing new to Russia.

In fact look at Nazi Germany. The conspiracies and worldview that Hitler had was not his own alone. Many Germans held similar sentiment especially WWI vets that were told the ""big lie"" that socialists/communists intentionally destroyed the German War effort and lost WWI for Germany. Many of them fell into antisemitic conspiracies which led to the holocaust. It wasn't Hitler alone that came to these conclusions.

TLDR: Dugin's views on Europe and the West are eerily similar to the policies of Putin, not so much in the east. Putin and Dugin's worldviews are similar but this could be because they both experienced similar events and this worldview is widely adopted within Russia by many people.",070fddc8c052749b40f05ededa4a5842b7a5da1f,True,False,,,,,0,1646152995,,0,{},hyxh7he,False,t3_t488qo,False,True,t3_t488qo,/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hyxh7he/,1646153005,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646124195.0,

Does any of that sound like 'Putin's approach to foreign policy'?

You're falling for confirmation bias, anything Dugin espoused was either being done for a long time already (fuelling instability abroad), or something that any Russian leader would be doing anyway (trying to increase their influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia).

I don't agree with you characterization of the level of American domination of the order. I think it is far more complex than that.

Those were the exact circles where it found its audience. Because 'Foundations of Geopolitics' impressed a hard-line minister of defense under Boris Yeltsin, Igor Rodionov, it became a standard assigned reading into the twenty-first century at the General Staff Academy - the main institution for training leaders in Russia's military as they worked to reformulate policy after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Russia woke a sleeping giant and gave it a righteous European war. This is bottom up outrage and even if the politicians wanted to reign it in, they will struggle.

The only thing that can stop this now is Russia ending the conflict. 

If secondary sanctions come into effect, it'll be because it enters the public thinking and politicians are driven into doing it. You could see this sort of thing happen with Swift.

""A return to a robust policy of containment is now the West’s best option. The fundamental goal will remain the same as the old policy: to counter Russian expansionism, inflict real costs on the Russian regime, and encourage internal change that leads to the ultimate collapse of Putin and Putinism. Of course, it needs to be adapted to the realities as they exist today rather than those that prevailed at the end of World War II. In particular, Russia’s close ties to a strong and newly assertive China will have to be addressed proactively.Still, Russia isn’t the Soviet Union, a military and ideological colossus nearly equal to the United States. Although it remains a nuclear power, its military is a shadow of its former Soviet self, and its economy is smaller than Canada’s, which has a quarter of Russia’s population. Meanwhile, the West has grown stronger. The United States retains unrivaled military power and has an economy 13 times larger than that of Russia. Europe, a defeated continent scarred by war and poverty after World War II, has emerged as a cohesive economic giant with a military that, although underfunded, enjoys significant modern capabilities to defend against a stretched Russian military. As a result, although a policy of containment will not deliver swift success or victory, its steady application in the months and years ahead should drive the necessary change in Russia within the next five to ten years.""",18ef07d0d46bd24687625ff77831c60650803681,True,False,,,,,0,1646149269,,0,{},hyx7ymd,True,t3_t4apy8,False,False,t3_t4apy8,/r/geopolitics/comments/t4apy8/the_return_of_containment_how_the_west_can/hyx7ymd/,1646149285,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646120469.0,

It's difficult to see what are the consequences. The amount of sanctions is unprecedented. Putin has brought NATO out of coma. Germany change of policy on its defense policy is something that will be seen in 10 years as the biggest event of this crisis. the magnitude of the military budget Germany has voted is mind-blowing and frankly scary.

[],False,,Hamstafish,,,[],,,,text,t2_73ruz,False,False,"If Putin is deposed by an organized coup from within his inner circle then we might see a return to some degree of ""normality"". However some things will never be the same. Russia will have been humiliated, the EU strengthened, and a strong Ukraine appears as a permanent threat to the south.  The survival of such a regime would be shaky.

Such a Russia would probably face paying reparations to Ukraine in exchange for dropping sanctions, a EU rapidly diversify away from Russian gas, and even nations like Kazakhstan feeling confident enough in Turkish and EU aid to drift away from Russia's sphere. 

If Putin is deposed by any group outside of his inner circle a huge power vacuum emerges. Putin surviving allies, would immediately act to protect themselves. Some might flee, others might cooperate and try to use the chaos to cement positions and power and others might resist.

Russia is a federation of 85 federal subject, of which 22 are ethnic republics. It is entirely possible that some of these federal subjects, would grant themselves major autonomy, and act as safe havens for Putin allies or even Putin himself. I cant image Kadyrov for example, being popular with any Putin replacement, but would be almost impossible to get rid of.

Whilst i don't think a civil war would break out, i think that it would take a long time for Russia to reorganize itself after a democratic uprising or military coup. If the Russia that emerges is communist, violently reactionary, a mafia state or a thriving democracy would be completely unknown. Even if a popular uprising would bring Navalny to power who knows who replaces him, or if he suffers a coup? The world would nervously watch, and hope that all of Russia's 6000+ nuclear weapons stay accounted for in the chaos.

If Navalny does come to power, he has the huge advantage of connections and respect in the west, this is hugely important as Zelnskyy currently demonstrates. It would enable him to access aid, and assistance from the EU essentially immediately, making it much more likely that the new regime survives the initial chaos as livings conditions and normality would return much faster than in other scenarios. This also would make a Pro-EU Russia much more likely as delays in assistance and integration into Europe that might come with a more unknown democrat in Russia could quickly sour Russians mood towards the west.

If Russia remains friendly with the EU. The need for NATO would rapidly disappear. Yet i think it would remain as a structure for western military cooperation, even if no nation relies on it for security it would be useful as a mechanism to coordinate military commands in future western interventions outside of the North Atlantic areas covered by the treaty. Germany's pacifism and Scandinavian neutrality would presumably rapidly reappear. 

In any case the end of Putin would end Lukasheko. A democratic Belarus would appear and integrate into the EU even if Russia doesn't. Georgia and Moldavia might use the chance to restore there territory. The comparative success of democratic Belarus and Ukraine in the EU compared to a Russia still mired in Oligarchy would make government very difficult in a Russia that wasn't able to replicate those success to its people. 

If Russia's power is broken by the end of Putin and Russia is unable to reassert itself quickly enough some parts may break away. Kaliningrad may strive to achieve enough autonomy to better integrate its self in Europe (maybe some sort of northern Ireland thing?). Some Ethnic republics may attempt to create new states (most however do not have non-Russian majorities)",723a786e392bbaa8abb25da6fa979dca0987d8b8,True,False,,,,,0,1646147622,,0,{},hyx40lo,False,t3_t47ha0,False,True,t3_t47ha0,/r/geopolitics/comments/t47ha0/hypothetical_geopolitical_consequences_of_a/hyx40lo/,1646147635,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646118822.0,

Perhaps this would include joining the EU and NATO. 

The biggest challenge to the order is not, at least in the medium term, growing multipolarity outside of the order: such adversaries can be defeated. The real challenge is growing multipolarity *within* the order. How can the order transition to something that is less about American unipolarity, subsidization and special privileges to go along with special responsibilities? The US voter needs more equal burden sharing. But can an order actually function and be maintained without a unipole with overwhelming primacy at its core?

Good point (qualitatively) but how much that increase is (quantum) still debatable 

&gt;First of all, it's impossible to predict the future you can only foreceast off of current trends and the negative demographic trend for Europe currently are the ageing baby boomers, the peopel born after WW2. The thing is, they won't live forever and once they all die off it could lead to a healtier population pyramid. Furthermore, again, it's impossible to predict the future and it's possible that birth rates will go up again at some point. Birthrates aren't always exactly rational, as an example French experienced massive decline in the birth rates starting from the late 18th century and then had fairly healthy birth rates in the second half of the 20th century when everyone else's birth rates were cratering.

My view is that all this going to happen not in 5 years but more like 50 years and before those good times EU is going suffer some serious pain if they try to outdo china then it can even lead to more pain than what China will go through their demographic collapse since EU has many different countries and ethnicities than China.

&gt; Finally there's technology. Going forward, robot tech and artificial intelligence will be getting better and better. Even if we never hit the general artificial intelligence that can solve any problem that combined with more and more sophisticated robotics will likely reduce the value of pure human numbers. And Europe, as the richest continent with a ton of R&amp;D, is in prime position to take advantage of those new technologies to offset the negative impact of declining and ageing population.

With the covid related supply issues it now seems like to me that the west can be blockaded from the hardware needed to run all that tech. Just something to ponder on for that tech aspect. While it wont reduce the performance to 0 but if stretched over a long time attrition of good hardware (relatively) can cripple",03fd5b2e864b46b86fe8271a2f974d4f2fb52bdf,True,False,,,,,0,1646145923,,0,{},hyx02zg,False,t3_t3nfzf,False,True,t1_hywvikn,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3nfzf/how_will_indias_abstentions_on_votes_on_russias/hyx02zg/,1646145937,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646117123.0,

When the Europeans wake from their bread and circuses they could very well decide to end the world. But it's their self inflicted fate of arrogantly believing the end of history was 1991/1946. 
Now the walls are closing in around the arrogant powers from the outside and from within, as a disenfranchised increasingly militant populace slowly radicalizes. 

This is what happens in democracies, every single time; democracy works until it doesn't.
Instead of being a problem solving tool, the capitalist democracy is the end game itself; the new religion. Because after all history ended right? This is really what their ruling class believes/believed. I studied in their universities, this is real and not a myth.
And this is similar to what happened in Cambodia, Weimar Republik, Yugoslavia and France to name a few. 

I suspect a Cambodia or Weimar outcome for most of the west, farmers and some contingent of militant workers disenfranchised militant youth.
It's already been seen, reactionary paramilitaries battle in the streets with anarchist agitators and accelerationist agents of chaos.

Now you have Ukraine, western extremist militias (and also Russian extremist neonazi and chechen militias/PMC's I might add) are currently going there to gain experience to bring back to their nations. Similar to what happened in the Islamic world, extremists would go to these war torn regions to spread their revolution and gain such experience. So you have western neo nazi's and some other types of nationalist militias going there to train for overthrowing their own governments.

The fact that we can see it so clearly, it is already too late for them to prolong their status quo. Imagine how much covert actions are being waged from within as we speak. 

USA can blame Russia or can try to blame us (China). You know it only makes it worse for them, deflect from their own deficiencies and systematic failures. I welcome their arrogance, let them; it prevents them from tending to their own issues and ensures their overthrow by extrajudicial means. And so I'm sure Russians did plant some of these seeds, but it does not mean they grew the tree.

In the end, the Europoids will develop a new system from the bloodshed and horrors to come.

&gt;That said, just because Dugin prescribes certain strategies that are present in Russian policy does not mean that Dugin was the policy’s inspiration or catalyst. I would underscore that Russian intelligence services’ efforts to provoke social strife and chaos within the US has a long history that predates Dugin and that Kremlin policymakers simply ignore many of Dugin’s recommendations. Occam’s razor suggests that in Dugin’s case, a broken clock is still right twice day; Dugin at best sometimes describes Russian policy, but to assign Dugin causality is entirely speculative, especially when many of Dugin’s recommended policies have a precedent in the Kremlin’s policy toolbox

So in short it's coincidental and  partial.

If the EU were to federalize tommorrow it would be one of top three great powers of the world I would argue ahead of China behind the US however it would immediately be a declining leading great power because of fairly slow growing GDP and declining population. However, as it is not federalized any further federalizing grows its power considerably on the global stage. 

That said, I'm not sure how much will the demographics impact Europe going forward. First of all, it's impossible to predict the future you can only foreceast off of current trends and the negative demographic trend for Europe currently are the ageing baby boomers, the peopel born after WW2. The thing is, they won't live forever and once they all die off it could lead to a healtier population pyramid. Furthermore, again, it's impossible to predict the future and it's possible that birth rates will go up again at some point. Birthrates aren't always exactly rational, as an example French experienced massive decline in the birth rates starting from the late 18th century and then had fairly healthy birth rates in the second half of the 20th century when everyone else's birth rates were cratering. 

Finally there's technology. Going forward, robot tech and artificial intelligence will be getting better and better. Even if we never hit the general artificial intelligence that can solve any problem that combined with more and more sophisticated robotics will likely reduce the value of pure human numbers. And Europe, as the richest continent with a ton of R&amp;D, is in prime position to take advantage of those new technologies to offset the negative impact of declining and ageing population.",7103aade99fc54e25618bcb1d19b79b1c66b11c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646143852,,0,{},hywvikn,False,t3_t3nfzf,False,True,t1_hywu00j,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3nfzf/how_will_indias_abstentions_on_votes_on_russias/hywvikn/,1646143865,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646115052.0,

I don't agree with this.

Best illustration of the new world order (not the conspiracy theory) is that in the Syrian Civil War, which was the most important war of the 2010s, US, China and the EU were all completely irrelevant to the outcome of the war. Instead that war was decided by Russia, Iran and Turkey, all middle powers. 

in that world India trying to play everyone is just ceding influence as China is spreading its own influence not only around Africa but also around India's backyard in Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan.

Also it is an illegal occupation and no country on the planet recognize the North as a country, not even Azerbaijan, which is essentially an extension of Turkey

There's no denying that Turkey ended up taking actions contrary to international law, however we do need to look at the broader context.

It's equally undeniable that:

1/ Tensions were high between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island, mostly as a leftover of British rule which used one against the other

2/ There had been anti-Turkish actions taken by the EOKA in the decade before 1974, including mass murders, with some events described as anti-Turkish pogroms by Western press. During the war, it is admitted that the Turkish minority fell victim to crime against humanity, recognized by the UN.

3/ Turkey didn't invade for no reason, but following a coup fostered by the EOKA, propped up by Greece military junta, with the clear aim of realizing the union between Greece and Cyprus, an unlawful prospect according to the London-Zurich agreements. It was also clear the EOKA fully intended on stamping down on the Turkish minority political rights.

4/ Prior to the invasion, Turkey did try to obtain a political settlement with Greece, which was rejected by the junta.

On top of that, yes the unilateral declaration of independence from Northern Cyprus was unlawful, but nevertheless Turkey did not oppose the Annan plan which would have had both countries reunited in a federation, but was ultimately rejected by Cyprus.

All in all, I'd still maintain Turkey behaviour wasn't unreasonable in regard to Cyprus, though they did react harshly to hostile actions fostered by Greece.",b072804d5ee56bbdd5198521b7eadc36649dc560,True,False,,,,,0,1646141039,,0,{},hywpvm6,False,t3_t3k66g,False,True,t1_hywl5bm,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3k66g/would_other_eu_countries_defend_finland_if_it/hywpvm6/,1646141051,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646112239.0,

Usually, dispute over the extent of territorial waters and EEZ should be settled by bilateral means and this has been the case in many instances. Both countries come at the table and normally the water zones aren't exactly what the convention says, but more like 50/50.

The problem is that it's very difficult to find such solution because both Greece and Turkey make unreasonable claims and are long-time enemies. 

On the one hand, Turkey's claims that Greek islands shouldn't have territorial waters (not to mention EEZ) is utterly ridiculous and unacceptable for Greece which has hundreds of islands. 

On the other hand, the fact that the application of the convention would mean that Turkey would have a ridiculously small EEZ, despite having huge shores, is equally unacceptable for Turkey - not to mention the issue of tiny islands like Kastellorizo which make an unreasonably big dent on Turkey's zones.

The core of the issue is that the Eastern mediterranean and Aegan seas have hundreds  of islands which nearly all belong to Greece, which have unintended consequences. 

So really, my take is that ideally we should force Greece and Turkey to find a settlement which would likely resolve the issues, by giving Turkey some zones (and therefore resources) so that it would stop adopting brash measures to prevent the application of maritime law.

If this issue is resolved, I don't think Turkey would go on - as a matter of fact, their behaviour towards Northern Cyprus has been quite reasonable since nearly the start of the dispute - which was mostly caused by Greece dictatorial regime at that time.",b4b8e6f51c15e3fa882110791ad0b30bd363d2cf,True,False,,,,,0,1646137036,,0,{},hywizle,False,t3_t3k66g,False,True,t1_hywhfwf,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3k66g/would_other_eu_countries_defend_finland_if_it/hywizle/,1646137048,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646108236.0,

Although I personnaly tend to feel closer to Greece in its struggle, I appreciate that the direct application of maritime law can be deemed unfair by Turkey given the very specific geography of Eastern mediterranean. It really is a complicated issue.

&gt;There has been a sudden and dramatic change in Finnish public opinion on NATO membership. According to a new poll, 53% of Finns are in favor of joining NATO. Only 28% are against.  
&gt;  
&gt;A small thread about the notable development.  
&gt;  
&gt;Context: For the last 25-30 years public opinion concerning NATO membership has been remarkably stable. Roughly 1/4 of Finns have supported membership, approx 1/2 have been against. This pattern has now changed as a reaction to Russia's posturing and escalation in Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finnish leadership and the broader political field were unprepared for the shift. Only 2/10 parties in the parliament are in favor of membership. It will be interesting to follow how the political landscape will adjust. Parties need to address the issue internally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today the representatives of the different parliamentary groups sit down to discuss the war in Ukraine and also the NATO question. It's neither a parliamentary debate nor a vote. Rather, its a first step of the above-mentioned adjustment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pro-NATO wave was first and foremost a reaction to the Russian aggression in Ukraine - a channel for Finns to funnel their understandable concern about Russia's behavior. We don't know yet where public opinion will settle in the longer term. Volatility is possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Public opinion has hitherto been only one of the several factors maintaining Finland's nominal non-allied status. In other words, a shift in one factor does not necessarily result in a policy change. IMO, Finland's NATO membership is still unlikely in the short term.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current leadership clearly sees non-NATO membership as an useful strategic tool in managing Finland's relationship with Russia. That said, many of the cornerstones of Finland's foreign policy, such as its relations with Russia, are in currently flux.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bottom line: the environment for NATO debate in 🇫🇮 is more permissive than before, but a single poll does not yet lead to a policy transformation. The direction of internal debate, trends in European security, and the eventual state of West-Russia relations will be decisive.

What does matter is how the West is building the narrative. The amplitude of West reaction shows that Ukraine's faith has become ""The reason of state"" of Western countries.

Once the narrative is built, it is really hard to go against it.

In addition, the Chinese position on Russia's threats toward Ukraine were inconsistent, on Feb 19 stating that Ukraine's territorial rights should be respected, and then on the day of invasion telling reporters that the US was responsible for it.  
  
China seems to struggle with their position on the crisis, and that in itself could pose some major obstacles to their global interests and their goals. How close they stand to Russia could have an even more far-reaching impact. At the UN Security Council, China abstained from the vote condemning Russia, and though at least two Chinese state-owned banks said that they were going to restrict financing purchases of Russian commodities, the Chinese Foreign Ministry \[called western sanctions ""illegal and unilateral"" and brushed of a call from the White House asking for condemnation of Russia's attack\](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/russia-ukraine-conflict-china-opposes-sanctions-swift-russian-banks-2525446). In addition, China liberalized trade and lifted restrictions on imports of Russian grain imports in the days leading up to the invasion, while Russia postponed its attack until after the close of the Olympics.  
  
Experience has shown that Chinese diplomats have a tendency to reveal China's true intentions and their true attitude on certain topics when they believe the power differential to be heavily in their favor, and indeed in the above linked article it seems they suggested to Australian officials that there was a security pretext to Russia's invasion, and \[in a tweet by China's Consul General in Osaka\](https://www.msn.com/ja-jp/news/world/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E7%B7%8F%E9%A0%98%E4%BA%8B%E3%81%8C%E3%83%84%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%80%8C%E5%BC%B7%E3%81%84%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AB%E5%96%A7%E5%98%A9%E3%82%92%E5%A3%B2%E3%82%8B%E3%81%AA%E3%80%8D-%E5%8F%B0%E6%B9%BE%E3%82%84%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%88%B6%E3%81%8B/ar-AAUhz2q?ocid=st), they were more overt, saying, ""the weak don't pick fights with the strong"".

Because western and Indian interests are not perfectly aligned. America is interested in disallowing another regional hegemon that can roam the free seas. Europe is interested in whatever America is interested in, because they depend on American security architecture. China is interested in becoming Asia's regional hegemon, so that it can start causing trouble in the America's backyard. And India's interests are to keep its territorial integrity while being able to grow and pull its people out of poverty.

All these interests have some overlap, but they are not the same. For example, if Japan and South Korea were to get belligerent, China might decide to settle its border dispute with India for the time being while dealing with America's allies in the East. This would allow China to not worry about its  westerns flanks for a while, which providing India some guarantees on its territories. If Pakistan could be brought into this system (through either coercion or persuasion), this would reduce a lot of South Asian security concerns for maybe a couple of decades while America and China duel it out.

India is correct to not move too fast. We are in a transitory period, and India with its large impoverished population needs to first look for its own interests by making sure that the horse they back would definitely win. A mistake here could lead to many lost centuries all over again.

I don't claim that they 'are' on equal footing. But how you expect to establish trust and rapport with actors who will essentially tell you that their words mean nothing if they aren't on paper or inscribed in international agreements, is completely beyond me.

&gt; This is also a mixed bag since guys like Putin are never to be trusted 100% what they say.

That's true, but let's not keep it to one side of the ledger here. Because that same logic applies just as much to Western actors as well. If you don't believe me, Gaddafi made a similar mistake by trust West. You know who isn't rolling the dice on that? North Korea. Can you blame them?

&gt; Additionally, no side here is to blame regarding ""who lied first?"", which realistically will always be blaming the other side for it.

Of course. That's why this situation doesn't exist in a vacuum and can't be written off as ""Putin bad,"" ""Russia bad.""

&gt; Actually talking to neighboring countries no matter the size or global importance at eye level and try to establish trade agreements or unions in which both sides or people prosper.

&gt; Try to actually care for your own people and demolish the oligarchy, which ultimately will lead to Russia's demise in the long term if they couldn't contain it in the future. So in general just spread the wealth of your country between more participants than just a bunch of your chronies.

&gt; Actually improving infrastructure, education and healthcarend the overall well being of your own people. And for what it's worth, stop the utterly embarassing oppression of others that don't agree with you. It speaks volumes when you have eliminate or brutalize people for this, it quiet telling that you've build an insecure system based on favouritism and violence just to keep people in check and to be corrupt.

That's quite an interesting framing of the issue.

So despite repeated warnings by Russia that bringing NATO to its borders would be perceived as a strategic threat, the momentum of NATO enlargement continued. And what does this have to do with the Oligarchy?...

At the Bucharest NATO summit in 2008, you remember when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership: ‘NATO welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. But Membership Action Plans (MAPs) were deferred because of German and French concerns that encircling Russia would be unnecessarily provocative, especially since Gorbachev had been told that NATO would not advance to the east. From Russia’s perspective, there was no security vacuum that needed to be filled; from the West’s perspective, who was to deny the sovereign choice of the Central and Eastern European states if they wished to enter the world’s most successful multilateral security body.

So because of this, NATO’s existence became justified by the need to manage the security threats *provoked by its own enlargement and existence* in the first place. The  Warsaw Pact and Baltic states joined NATO to enhance their security, but the very act of doing so created a security dilemma for Russia that undermined the security of all. (One that according to Robert Jervis, is when a state takes measures to enhance its own security, but those measures will inevitably be seen as offensive rather than defensive by other states who then undertake measures to increase their own security) and in this case, provoked the Ukraine crisis.

Do you see the paradox here?",44468e9657a2bddfb50a911e22136505a6c53334,True,False,,,,,0,1646120659,,0,{},hyvyfce,False,t3_t3fngo,False,False,t1_hyvx6oc,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3fngo/garry_kasparov_how_the_free_world_gave_putin_the/hyvyfce/,1646120673,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646091859.0,

* There is no way the US would tolerate being in alliance with a country that buys so much weapons from Russia.

Before the US tolerated countries with Russian weapons systems, and made exceptions

The West is pretty much united. Any country with Russian weapons systems gets the back of the queue that includes Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia (in Asia). Indonesia got the message and bought Rafale recently, and most likely will phase out its Russian jets with F15s.

The Russian invasion has united the West. Security concerns will be criteria in trade discussions. The EU will pressure Vietnam to get rid of its Russian equipment or it will scrape the EU-Vietnam FTA. The EU is in this position with Ukraine because it is focused on economic, environmental concerns over security and ideology.

Indians should sit back in think. Your two largest export markets are essentially supporting a war against your largest arms supplier. And you are distancing yourself from Asia.

With a united West, China can be stopped right now. Already the Chinese are sweating buckets. Why wait 20-30 years for India to grow.

Our Indian nationalists here think India is the ace in the hole for containing China, and the West will allow India to keep on buying Russian weapons. The US has made exceptions for India, but after the invasion, India has to come up with a timetable to replace its Russian weapons.

The Ukraine-Crimea invasion isn't like any other invasions post-1945. Prior to Crimea none of the Permanent Five have invaded other countries with the intent of absorbing them, not even the USSR. The invasion of Ukraine isn't like Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, because the US eventually left. If the Russian invasion succeeds, in 20 years' time Ukraine will be no more.  Putin wants to wipe out Ukraine as a nation. This talk of a demilitarized Ukraine is just a setup for continued interference, then eventual annexation.

Of all the five permanent security council members, the USSR continued to absorb territory right up to 1945.

Not at all. The fact remains that this is still proxy war no matter how many missiles each side lobs at each other.

I know that there has been a rise in right wing nationalism which seems to inevitably foment racism as nationalism seems to require some ""other"" to fight against.  From what I understand also Bosnians fleeing the Kosovo conflict in the 90s experienced severe problems with racism despite they're being white, or ateast looking that way, im aware Europe has a different view sometimes on what constitutes being white than America.  Bosnia was pretty heavily majority Muslim as well though which is a pretty common thread between Africa, the ME, and parts of southeast asia.
I wouldn't be surprised at fleeing Ukrainians having similar experiences as Bosnian over the next year or so.  Between the expanding pressure cracks in the western worlds social safety nets and high unemployment, under employment, and spiraling prices I can see them getting lumped in some way with the rest of the refugees and suffering similar treatment as the war drags on.  Quite frankly I think any refugees in large numbers will sadly experience this but I do think skin color exacerbates it massively.  It certainly gives the people who derive their power from fear mongering to use racism as a tool for leverage, just look at the rise of marine le pen or an even better example orban in Hungary or trump here in the states.
As for a hypothetical hot conflict between India and Pakistan going nuclear a quick Google search estimated around 160 warheads for each country.

For one the term “settlements” give an incorrect image of their true scale. About 600,000 Israeli Jews live in West Bank and to completely uproot them would simply never happen. First of all the settlers would be vehemently, possibly violently, opposed to the Israeli government forcing them out of their homes. Not to mention that there’s a housing shortage in Israel and there simply wouldn’t be enough space to cram them all. 

And that’s just West Bank. You talk about the Israelis withdrawing to the UN partition borders and those are drastically different from the borders we see today. To implement them would require the forced movement of millions more people from not only Jerusalem (their capital and most sacred city which they would never abandon) but hundreds of other cities, towns, and villages. 

And an important thing to mention is that Israel already tried withdrawal when it came to Gaza. Admittedly they had much fewer people living there and even now exert a large level of control over borders and security but that’s besides the point. When the withdrawal was being proposed it was sold to the Israeli people as ending the conflict with Gaza. But after the withdrawal Hamas took over and had a harsher and more violent rhetoric and increased missile attacks and support for terrorism. What this has resulted in is a large percentage of the Israel people viewing the demolition of settlements in Gaza as a mistake.

NATO does not necessarily need to nuke Russia back as a first step, but they absolutely need to declare war. If not, NATO is dead, and the US/Western Europe are on their own as far as everyone else is concerned. This also ends the somewhat unspoken prohibition on actually using nuclear weapons. Many more countries will seek and then use nukes if Russia is not severely punished for breaking this rule. It makes no sense for the US/UK/France to to respond—to not do so is suicide of political and diplomatic nature and makes the world far more dangerous for them to exist in.

The politics of nuclear warfare then mean that NATO *must* retaliate, so the question is merely about how. NATO also does not want a full nuclear exchange, so probably what happens is conventional air and missile strikes against known Russian nuclear sites and Russian air defenses, and hunter/killer subs will attempt to engage Russian boomers.

I also should have mentioned that for some of these refugee groups, particularly the ME, there appears to be little interest in even trying to integrate into western society.  This leads to ostracization with some definite racial overtones no question, and disillisionment which then leads to potential violence and further ostracization.  In short, it's an easy domestic scapegoat and racism does play a depressingly large part in it.
For me personally the Ukraine conflict is a much larger deal because a bad decision or miscalculation could result in nukes flying.  My question now is, do you think that the world would be paying this much attention if say, India and Pakistan transitioned into a hot war?  I think yes because it's 2 countries with nuclear arsenals fighting right near the border of another country that has a significant nuclear arsenal.  They also represent enormous populations and solid economies.
Depending on who attacked first I also think that in the west, Indian refugees would receive similar levels of support from the international community as Ukraine whereas Pakistani refugees would have a significantly harder time.

[],False,,INDlG0,,,[],,,,text,t2_67303,False,False,"Am not Russian or an expert but it seems like from their side of the story:

-After World War II in 1945, the Soviets controlled or had influence over Eastern Europe in competition with NATO during the Cold War. They created the Warsaw Pact (Soviet version of NATO) and was the only other superpower in rivalry with the Americans, competing over various areas of the world (Vietnam, South American dictatorships, Korea, many others) during the Cold War.

-NATO won the Cold War through better economies, technology, influence, and management, making East Germany eventually join West Germany, Warsaw Pact collapses along with Soviet Union. The Russians then became much weaker and took decades to return as a world power.

-During that time (1991 to 2010's) Ex-Warsaw Pact members have slowly joined NATO and/or EU (most of Eastern Europe), or has slowly become Westernized (Georgia, Ukraine). Russia's list of allies are shrinking, with even previously neutral countries like Finland joining the Western alliances.

-Russia's current allies in Europe include only Belarus and Armenia. Even in Asia, their allies which include countries like Kazakhstan and Mongolia, which are rapidly being influenced by Chinese money and infrastructure. Azerbaijan has become under Turkish influence. Many of Russia's allies are already too weak and/or too far away (Cuba, Venezuela, Syria, etc.)

From their perspective, the Americans are slowly getting closer and closer to Moscow and the heart of Russia, and their influence in Asia and the rest of the world is shrinking. They were under the assumption that NATO would stop ""expanding East"", but things like Georgia trying to join NATO, the US putting missile defence bases in Poland have really terrified them. I think that Ukraine, which is where Russian civilization started (Kievan Rus) joining NATO and becoming Westernized was the last straw. It is culturally and historically extremely important, and its position if taken by NATO would allow the West to invade/bomb Moscow and put them in a vulnerable position. Whether or not the Americans/EU would even want to do this is not important, Putin sees Ukraine, Russia, and Ukraine as being one nation.

To view from their perspective, it could be as if the US split up after the Cold War and the Southern US left the United States to make a new country, with Canada and Mexico also joining the Russian side. Then, the newly independent South begins talking about joining the Warsaw Pact, creating bases in Virginia, Ontario, and Quebec, surrounding the American ""heartland"".

[],False,,Objective-Injury-687,,,[],,,,text,t2_88sf9r0e,False,False,"Russia has an *almost* legitimate reason to be afraid.

In 1994 US president Bill Clinton started a bombing campaign on Yugoslavia (really it was a war but that's for a different discussion). The campaign led to the collapse of the post Soviet nation and it was subsequently balkanized into various less powerful and dependent states. This is despite the entire international community largely decrying US involvement and the US bombing a different country's embassy into rubble.

Fast forward in 2000 Vladimir Putin takes control of a decrepit and ailing Russia. Chechnya has been an independent and unsolved problem for Russia since 1995 and Chechen's continue to kill Russian citizens in the area. Many would not see the comparison, but it is there. An ailing post Soviet state wracked with internal conflict and civil war, both Yugoslavia and Russia of 2000 fit this description. Putin engages the Russian military to solve the issue once and for all. And it was pretty much a disaster from day 1. It played out in largely the same way we now see the Ukranian conflict playing out. Thousands of Russian conscripts getting ambushed by dedicated but out gunned guerrillas and regulars. Russia eventually won by committing a near genocide in Grozny and basically leveling it. Russia's prize was a blackened wasteland that wouldn't be economically productive till the late 2010's.

The view in the west in the aftermath of this extremely bloody military campaign was that Russia was an ailing, failing country that no longer mattered and to Putin and possibly the rest of the world, the blood was in the water. In the early 2000's there was quite a bit of talk of expanding NATO and the west was ascendant and taking advantage of its prominent place in the world. Take this however you want but from Putins perspective I guarantee he looked at that and remembered the US balkanizing Yugoslavia from NATO bases in Italy and Germany. Given the multi ethnic and at times fractious Russian state, it's not unreasonable to think Putin watched that saw NATO creeping up to his doorstep and got a little paranoid. Couple that with a misadventure in Iraq in 2003, a nation Russia begged the US not to invade as they owed Russia ***billions*** in unpaid loans. Which the US promptly ignored even after Russia gave the US buildings full of Intel on Afghanistan. And it starts to become clear. Putin saw NATO led by an increasingly interventionist US creeping ever closer to a fractured and weakened Russia and quite frankly panicked. He could not guarantee that in 10,15, or 30 years the next president looking for votes wouldn't risk a military misadventure in Russia through NATO bases in former Soviet nations.

The flaw here is that Russia is a nuclear state with a gigantic well equipped military that also has deep political ties to the two most populated nations on earth who also happen to have nuclear weapons. Putin either forgot he had powerful allies in Asia or didn't trust them enough to have his back when the chips were down.

And now here we are.

Russia historically (since Catherine, the Great) has seen Eastern Europe as their god given right. They do not accept not being a big international player and they believe Ukraine is part of this heritage. 

After the Chechnya's wars were controlled, disputes over Ukraine started in 2003 with the dispute over Tuzla Island. Since then, Russia and Ukraine have been frenemies, co-dependent but never seeing eye to eye. 

During all this time, the Western powers treated most of this as internal affairs. However, Ukraine is an important energy player (production and pipelines) in Europe. 

Crimea and Donbas showed a signal that Putin was in an expansionist path that would affect EU economy in a large way and put Russia in a much powerful place. 

Being kicked out of the G8 and all the the other sanctions did not affect Russia's main economic lifelines (oligarchs and oil). So, Putin has been amassing what he thought were enough foreign reserves to survive this ""crisis"". He would just finish what he stared with Donbas and take over Ukraine.

I believe the US strategic community would want to defend Taiwan.

The Pacific Allies would want to defend them (though I think South Korea would probably not be a belligerent with American approval). Most capitalists would probably not want to, but besides not being able to change the prevailing winds I don’t think they’d do much about it (because I think a Taiwan conflict has a decent chance of being a limited war but that’s another analysis).

I think in that situation the President would *probably* still not be the deciding element, but depending on their particular political control and the current equilibrium they could be. But that possibility *would* make waiting for one who was “weak” worthwhile.

I'm not getting why you think a weak Russia would be focused on Central Asia and the Arctic when neither are core interests of Russia compared with holding back the EU super power next door.

Yes. Its own borders and areas where it doesn't have to compete with the West to project power: Central Asia and its own corner of the Arctic.

&gt; In fact, Russia has consistently demonstrated that it cares much more about - and has invested much more into - what happens in Eastern Europe than it does in Central Asia or the Arctic. Eastern Europe is precisely the main region of contention between the EU and Russia, from both a geographical and an ethnic political dimension. Russia's main interests are to keep the Slavic world outside of the EU's orbit, since it sees the Slavic world as its own back yard, similar to how China sees Taiwan. So I don't understand why this would be less important than former imperial territories like Central Asia and the Arctic, which were obtained by Russia only during the height of its power.

I would rephrase ""less important"" to ""less feasible,"" but anyways, it's for the same reason that France and Germany aren't at each other's throats all the time anymore. Their mutually contradictory interests have been subjugated by the interests of a greater power that roped them into being on the same side. If Russia cannot handle the expenditures of money and manpower necessary to project force into the rest of Eastern Europe while a greater power is guaranteeing everyone else there, and if that greater power will have them, they may find the easier path to influencing the region to be joining the same bloc.

Although my observation of United States/Canada, I believe this is the natural outcome of their current internal situations. And I don't take a side in that, as they all may have reasons. Including opportunists who lust for power, for war crimes, or ethnic cleansing as in Yugoslavia. (But any war really)

Since this is reddit, I don't want to waste too much time responding (esp as this is all theoretical arm chair guesstimating), so I probably won't replay after this. Basically it's cool if you still disagree after.

My quick response would be that given how weak Russia will be in the scenario, it'd be significantly more influencable by EU soft-power and along with EU $$$ to generate subterfuge and fund more EU leaning candidates, it makes sense for western leaning leaders to emerge as leaders slowly.

My deeper response would be to say that I say EU and not NATO/USA for a reason.

Given longer run time scale, in the modern era countries/states will all inevitably follow the $$ in my view (capitalism/the market), and $$$ = trade, so better relationships with it's neighbours usually as your neighbors tend to be your biggest trading partners.

The EU as a a whole is still the biggest trading partner of Russia and after fossil fuels become phased out, that trade partnership will only continue to grow stronger as China doesn't need anything from Russia other than energy sources. So Russian elites will be forced to follow the $$$, and work together more and more with the EU elites naturally (ofc central asia is an option, but they will never compete with the EU market anytime soon even long run).

The only reason a lot of the world followed what the US had to say at the core, is simply because the US was the wealthiest country in the world by far, hence all these countries followed the $$$ and were at the USA's beck and call.

That's not true nowadays, for example, the EU is already wealthier as a whole than the US in totality, and as the post-soviet states develop and 'catchup' to adanced nation standards, the EU market as a whole will be significantly wealthier than the US. By then they wiill become more and more indepedent due to prioritizing collective $$$ (i.e. internal trade), over anything the USA might want to push.

In that same way, the more democratic asian countries are right to be wary of China, but obviously they still need to work with China since so much trade and $$$ and so on occurs between them. The amount of trade will only continue to increase over time.

In the past China wasn't as wealthy, so these nations would prioritize their independence, but as China gets wealthier, and these countries are only going to more and more interconnected and work together more and more since again $$$ = everything in modern world. They care about independence today, but in 30-40 years? I think a lot of those countries would choose the $$, or at least not be so against closer ties (Russia and EU don't have major ideological barriers too).

tl;dr. Russia's biggest trading partner is the EU. Their fossil fuels have allowed them to have a lot of independence, but as fossil fuels get phased out, following the money/$$$ (trade), the Russians will have to go back to friendlier terms with the EU (their biggest trading partner). Reality is everything is about $$$ in the modern era, and in truth, always has been.

The article is written by: Rebecca Barber. ""a Research Fellow with the Asia Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect"" who is a PhD Candidate at the TC Beirne School of Law, University of Queensland.

The article spends a good deal of time introducing the mechanics of the UN with regard to the two major bodies: the Security Council and the General Assembly.  Many people may be familiar with the questions covered . For those who are not familiar the author walks through the rules, history and controversies that surround the two bodies, how each one becomes activated.

The article then considers what the author believes the General Assembly could do, - two actions in fact. 

First, they suggest passing a General Assembly resolution.  The resolution suggested by the author in their words would characterize ""state conduct as an act of aggression.""  The author cites 6 previous instances where this has been done by the General Assembly. 

Following this, the author suggests what they call a more ""substantive"" step of imposing sanctions.  The author points to "" asset freezes and travel bans targeting senior government officials,"" and sanctions  on financial institutions.

The author uses the term ""unilateral coercive measures"" to describe some actions for which sanctions might be sought.  The article investigates this language in some detail, with the author noting that they have recently [published articles](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-and-comparative-law-quarterly/article/an-exploration-of-the-general-assemblys-troubled-relationship-with-unilateral-sanctions/B5BD937CE4BFB6D7CC22278AC88271CD),  Cambridge University Press, on the subject  

Those who are watching the recent financial and banking community responses to war events will note that in some circumstances these kinds of sanctions are already occurring (including actions in Switzerland and elsewhere).  

So one useful question is: does a General Assembly resolution add strength and or emphasis to actions and encouragement to sanction actions that are being considered or are in already process?  

The author does explain that this and such a resolution would not declare that ""all unilateral coercive measures are illegal.  But instead the author does include a key paragraph that concludes with regard such General Assembly Resolutions that: 

&gt;"" In fact, close examination of the Assembly’s resolutions on unilateral coercive measures suggests that the Assembly has in fact taken the view that unilateral coercive measures are illegal if they: coercively encroach upon a state’s domaine reserve; fail to respect established principles of due process; negatively impact human rights;""

By Garry Kasparov
Chicago Tribune |
Feb 25, 2022 at 2:00 PM


Early Thursday morning, Germany invaded Ukraine. So did the Netherlands, Italy, France, Great Britain and every other country that has supported Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s war machine for the past decade.

The missiles that slammed into Kharkiv, the helicopters attacking an airport near the capital Kyiv, every bullet in every Russian paratrooper’s gun — all were built or bought largely with money from the free world. That same free world now stands in shock that these weapons are being used to do what they were designed to do.

Europe bought Russian gas and oil and welcomed Putin’s oligarch cronies’ looted billions in IPOs, real estate purchases, and political donations legal and illegal. Even after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea, Europe tried to keep business as usual separate from Russia’s assault on European security and the global world order.

On Thursday, Putin repaid them in full for their years of appeasement. After weeks of posturing and dramatic calls for summits and negotiations made headlines around the world, he sent his massed forces into Ukraine on the schedule he set months ago. The preening shuttle diplomacy by France’s Emanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz was revealed to have been a waste of time for everyone but Putin, who used it to ready his forces for the attack.

That time could have been used to arm Ukraine with the weapons it badly needs to fend off Russia’s overwhelming military superiority. It could have been used to level sanctions to demonstrate that this time, for once, the West was serious about deterrence.

Instead, Ukraine was treated like a beggar and sanctions were kept in reserve, as a threat Putin had little reason to expect was serious. After all, goes his thinking, if you have the power to stop me and choose not to use it, aren’t you giving me the green light?

It’s not as if Putin tried to hide what he was doing. Spies and satellites weren’t necessary to tease out that Russia was investing record sums in its military capacity and security forces; it was right there in the national budget for years. Russia may be falling apart and falling behind, but there was always plenty of cash for security forces and propaganda, the budget of a dictator.

Putin was so confident of his potential rivals’ obliviousness and cowardice that he brought nearly every mobile element of the Russian military to Ukraine’s border over the course of two months. There were barely any of the usual pretexts about “exercises,” even when Russia took the unusual step of moving a large force into Belarus, where they were poised just a couple of hours from Kyiv.

Of course, this is far from the first time that the world has ignored Putin’s warnings, let alone mine. Five years into his rule in Russia, Putin infamously stated that “the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” Few took it seriously or understood it to mean that Putin would try to reverse that catastrophe should he have the chance. A clear warning was ignored, much the way Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” was considered little more than hateful ranting when it was published in 1925.

Now a war of conquest has erupted in Europe, the greatest ever threat to the post-World War II order of borders and laws. Tanks are rolling and jets are dogfighting above major cities. Putin has followed through on his promise to try to crush Ukraine, which he first invaded in 2014. My New York Daily News op-ed on Putin at the time was bluntly titled “Stop This Man.” Needless to say, Putin has not been stopped.

Eight years later, Putin and his war machine are much stronger. Instead of being politically isolated and economically cut off, his regime has profited from record gas and oil exports. Most profits are siphoned off into the private accounts that make Putin and his cronies the richest people in the world. Much of the rest has gone into a literal war chest, expanding and improving Russia’s military and internal security forces and filling a reserve fund to help them weather sanctions.

Time has made Putin’s grip on power in Russia stronger as well, with every significant critic dead, jailed or exiled. The last major protests, in 2020 on behalf of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, were met by an army of well-equipped riot police. Their shiny new helmets and batons were also paid for by the same European nations whose leaders meekly protested the brutality.

Putin is not invulnerable, nor is his army. Ukraine is fighting hard, and if the initial onslaught is repulsed, and aid arrives in time, Putin could find himself in a difficult position. He will have to either retreat or choose total war against an urban population, which could shock even sleepy NATO into action.

Russians came out to protest this war in the largest numbers since 2020, with more than 1,700 arrests across the country on the first day. Most Russians get their news from state-controlled television, unfortunately, where they are told this is a war of self-defense against the “Nazis” in Ukraine and their masters in America. But the longer the war goes on, the more obvious it will be that Putin’s needless war on Ukraine is also part of Putin’s war on Russians.

Russia has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal and Putin invokes it regularly, but there is much that can be done to constrain him and save lives now. After years of my warnings and proposals being ignored, and now hearing “You were right, Garry!” all day, I’ll repeat what I said in 2014: Stop telling me I was right and start listening now. My recommendations:

    Support Ukraine militarily, immediately. Everything but boots on the ground, meaning every advanced weapon, intelligence and cyber-capability. It has to be now. If Ukraine falls, Putin will bleed it dry to compensate for sanctions and dig in, as he has in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Victory in Ukraine is also the only way to avoid doing this all again, when Putin needs new targets to distract from the disastrous state of Russia.
    Bankrupt Putin’s war machine by freezing and seizing Russian assets and access to markets. Kick Russia out of SWIFT and other financial networks, and every international institution.
    Expose and seize the assets of Putin’s cronies and their companies and families in the free world. Take away their visas and send them back to live in the dictatorship they helped build.
    Recall all ambassadors from Russia. There is no point in diplomacy or communications with a rogue dictatorship making war. Send the message that isolation will be total until all aggression ceases and Ukraine is made whole.
    Turn off, shut down and send home every element of Putin’s global propaganda machine. Russia Today and other platforms beam lies and hate into millions of homes in the free world, while Putin maintains total control of the media in Russia.
    Call out Putin’s lackeys in the free world. The lobbyists, the law firms, the former politicians like German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who chairs two of Putin’s strategically important energy companies. This includes the fifth columnists of all political stripes who side with a dictator for ideology or Russian cash. Why do executives and advertisers tolerate the likes of Tucker Carlson braying Putin propaganda in prime time? Donald Trump and his acolytes in Congress still can’t find a discouraging word for Putin and repeat Russian propaganda blaming NATO and President Biden even as Russian bombs fall on Ukraine. I’ve bashed every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan over Russia policy, but praising a bloodthirsty dictator to score partisan points is disgusting and un-American.
    Replace Russian energy exports by increasing production and opening new sources, from fracking to nuclear to renewables. Giving authoritarians so much leverage for extortion is unacceptable. There’s no point in saving the planet if you don’t save the people on it.

Joe Biden’s Cold War background has prepared him better than most of his European peers. His grave tone and announcement of serious sanctions were a welcome start. Most EU leaders, even the ones in the East who grasp the danger Putin represents, are a generation removed from confrontation and conflict. But now they must help Ukraine fight against the monster they helped create.

This is war, a hot war, no longer deterrence, and time is of the essence to get weapons to Ukraine so it can fight the war for freedom that the rest of the world has preferred to pretend isn’t real.

We must acknowledge that there will be sacrifices involved. The price of stopping Putin has gone up since 2008, when he invaded Georgia, and since 2014, when he first invaded Ukraine, but it will only get higher if he isn’t stopped now. Failing to fight will only postpone the inevitable to another time and place.

Defending Ukraine from Putin is the defense of the free world. Defending Ukrainian lives is the defense of Western values.

Nope. You need to bring *a lot* of hardware, machinery and men to do an amphibious landing. You would need to ship a lot of boats with a lot of commandos and marines through Puerto Rico and it would be 1.000km, give it or take, of a heavily exposed fleet slowly sailing through the Caribbean. Remember how the whole world saw Russia pilling up men and tanks for the last 3 years? Everyone would see the US doing it as well. You would need to detach a whole Task Force just to escort the soldiers and then establish a beachhead close to Venezuela's 2nd largest city. The only way is through Colombia and Guyana, and neither have even the smallest of incentives to allow the US to breach a sovereign company and wage an unprovoked war just because. This is *literally* what Putin just did, except that the US would drag another country as well and would be invading a country that isn't a neighbor, so even worst logistics-wise. 

&gt; Why would there be a power vacuum? We can just annex the country directly and place it under a military administrator.

Why would there be a civil war? We can easily destroy Venezuela’s military, and use concentration camps like the British did in the Boer war to control the population. The guerrilla is the fish that swims in the ocean of the people, so if you drain the ocean (lock up all the people), there will be no guerrillas.

Well, if you are throwing Geneva Convention out of the window, why don't you just nuke Caracas? Even better, skip the middle man and nuke Moscow straight away. 

You *cannot* set concentration camps. It is a war crime and one of the major reasons why we still consider Swastikas the ultimate symbol of evil. The Boer War is notorious for war crimes. You're treating the Venezuelans like a group of savages from the 17th century. They are an organized army and, unless you are levelling Caracas and Maracaibo to the ground, even with Colombian help you would need weeks of build up and even more weeks to conquest the city. Again, if your masterplan is ""let's arrest everyone who doesn't want to be American"", skip the middle man and unleash your nukes. Spare everyone's time and end the world right away.

&gt; What would cause destabilization in the other countries? Also, why do we care if they become destabilized?

Venezuela and Colombia share a border, OK? Point A. Colombia just settled peace agreements with FARC, a guerilla group that pested them for decades, point B. Colombia is barely hanging around the settlements for peace. You throw in 100k marines wanking around, that peace agreement goes out and Colombia have to deal with was basically a civil war and should resume being one, specially with Cuba supplying FARC (that would also destabilize US' weak supply lines through the Amazon into Venezuela). Brazil is going through a deep economic crisis, an erratic president and will go through a very polarized general elections, with a strong chance of a coup attempt and fractures. If you add the US waging war near the Amazon forest, it would be a flick to Brazil venture into a civil war (Bolsonaro seizes the chance and throw a coup, the Army gets nervous and oust Bolsonaro to join the war, or even Bolsonaro goes full Argentina and declares war, although I cannot see Bolsonaro and Maduro on the same trench).

Why should you care, you ask? The US tend to like their courtyard at peace, just like every other major power does. Colombia is the US' haven in South America for the last years and both Republican and Democrat administrations helped Colombia break in their peace deals with FARC. A Colombian Civil War would obligate the US to have boots on the ground in Colombia, at risk of losing their only stronghold south of San Juan, entangled in a dirty guerrilla war that would make Iraq a summer walk in the park.

Brazil is the 7th economy in the world. We are the main food suppliers to a good chunk of the world, the largest potable water reserves are here and we have strong connections with Russia, China and the US itself. Think India entering a Civil War, or Australia, it would have the same impact. Not only the US would need to get involved, but China would be more than happy to get involved as well and become the #1 partner of the 3rd largest economy in the continent. And no, the US cannot invade Brazil, a Brazil War would make Vietnam look like training camp. Unless, again, you just spam nukes and screams U-S-A while riding an eagle.

You are basically saying you are OK with the US needing to patrol a whole continent just because you want petrol. Venezuela would be a lot more expensive and bloody to deal than Iraq and Afghanistan and you would most likely need to invade Cuba as well. I cannot put more into words how terrible, on every end, this idea is.",d56987fe6202b97eee0b50bc1d1b2608d40f1ee6,True,False,,,,,0,1646099882,,0,{},hyuwzqg,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyutadc,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyuwzqg/,1646099900,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646071082.0,

Immediate Concerns:

* Russian forces advancing north and east from Crimea threaten to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine if Kyiv does not withdraw them in the coming days.
* Russian forces began using artillery against residential areas in Kharkiv on February 28, likely signaling a dangerous new phase of Russian operations.
* Russian forces face growing morale and supply issues but will likely be able to overcome these handicaps.
* Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities and eventually take the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.
* Russia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower the conventional Ukrainian forces defending them.",892a1e6dd0cf2d4f0c7e678393769e4f9ba46920,True,False,,,,,0,1646097718,,0,{},hyuscae,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyuscae/,1646097731,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646068918.0,

&gt; Proceed to immediately invade a sovereign nation

But, if you want to proceed like a RTS game, an invasion of Venezuela would be a terrible idea. You would have only one gateway to invade, which would be through Colombia. Colombia is always up to some fun and skirmishes with Venezuela, but I seriously doubt they would be up to a conventional war, specially when internally they are trying to cement the peace agreements they made with FARC. Brazil (and I speak with property here) won't join the US in the war either. We are on a deep economic crisis, Bolsonaro lost entirely his ties with the US after Trump lost and we are in an election year, so either he would be neutral or would seize the instability to cement the coup he is threating since 2020. The last thing the US wants in South America is a dictator as unstable as Bolsonaro is (not just internally. He was entirely on Trump's corner in 2018, celebrated the extra-NATO alliance as his biggest victory and now, in 2022, he is subtly siding with Russia). 

So, just with the invasion kickstart you threaten to destabilize your biggest ally in the region (Colombia) and turns upside down the biggest power in the region (Brazil) with entirely unknown results. ""Oh, but oil"" Venezuelan oil is extra-heavy. Hard to refine, not efficient. You are not solving your oil supply issues in the short term, you are definitely not solving the natural gas issue to Europe and you are creating a giant wild card in the continent. *No one* can remotely predict the results of the power vacuum in Venezuela. Guaidó is weak and Maduro doesn't have a lieutenant in place to replace him. You're most likely throwing Venezuela in a long and bloody civil war, that will destabilize the whole continent and the Caribbean. The ripple effects would go as far as Mexico and, considering how unstable the situation is in Brazil itself, could even lead to a Brazilian civil war (unlikely in the current status quo, but with a destabilized Amazon and a refugee crisis in the North, everything could change). 

As you can see, it goes more than the basic morality and PR war the West is battling. An invasion of Venezuela would net marginal results in raw materials and resources, but would bring at least three countries towards a major crisis and ignite war right in the US' backyard. And I'm not even considering the deeper ripple effects that this could have (Peru and Chile just elected new presidents and both are already hanging, a war in the continent could also push the tip to destabilization there).",0d8f5728bc67de4eeba165c55a737a8375e520b8,True,False,,,,,0,1646094396,,0,{},hyulbr9,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyu73dl,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyulbr9/,1646094411,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646065596.0,

A post putin russia can quite easily rebrand itself as a friend of Europe with much remorse and regret. This is putins war, once he is gone many doors open.

Does russia really see Europe as its enemy? Or does it see a future where its actually closer to Europe than the US is right now.
