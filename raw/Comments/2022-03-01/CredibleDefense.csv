Just like Germany was, after 1939.  \_We\_ have made it a global effort, by economic means.  And if the Russians do what the Germans did, huddling behind national leadership, because they know surrender at this point will still result in sanctions and demilitarization, that will make the peace untenable; \*\*even knowing they are going to lose\*\*, long term, they will.

Call it blind herd instinct or a hopeful reachout to fate to open a third option (Chinese manufacturing economics as SCO driven relief...), even just a hardnosed certainty that messing about with macroeconomic controls could easily throw the West into economic depression, by turning off the gas and having the nukes to prevent it being turned back on.

Russians are now in a position where knuckling under to mob democracy as hysterical demands that they stop winning in a war with Ukraine, does them NO GOOD AT ALL.

Consider the reverse.  Nuclear weapons are introduced to Cuba, we find that intolerable.  Are we going to invade Havanna or let them 'threaten the Southern U.S.'?

Even today, the answer would be regime change because we cannot afford a constant threat, that close in.  And we would have no more right to attempt it that we did in 1962.  Because a free world means national sovereignty for all, as an absolute, not economic or population mass driven, condition.

Russia is in the same position.  If she gives up today, she will lose tomorrow, because it will be just too easy to end Moscow, seize the Caspian and suppress the national ICBM fields with Aegis Shore.  
So she gains nothing by quitting because her reputation is already damaged and unseating Putin will not change that while no one they replace him with will have the courage to continue his war.

I have absolutely no respect for Ukraine, a country which has a very bad history with Russia, whose monumental corruption has seen the selloff of the world's fourth largest military, and who now cries like a woman, demanding rescue from The West, knowing that we have never faced down the Russians before, in any of our prior Cold War hand's off observances of the crushing of Hungarian, Czech and Polish crises.

Not once.

Because Nukes.

The Nukes are now more useful than ever.  And, conventionally, we have never been weaker in terms of fighting a high intensity, Peer Level, war.

Sovereignty is the right to own your INNER zone politics and culture choices.  But it comes with the demand that you \_protect\_ your own OUTER zone, including near abroad, interests.  It's not presumptive of rights without duties.

It is not female.

And I will not stand by and see us drug by inches of deliberate escalation towards a cliff where 44 million Ukrainians, who have already chosen their fate, have a right to pull us over the precipice of nuclear face loss, if not outright devastation.

Because there are 340 million Americans, 20 million Romanians and 38 million Poles who did not give up their inherent masculine duty to protect themselves and, as junior members of NATO, are our allies.  
When Ukraine has ceded her adult duties and is not a NATO member because of that bad faith act.

And that is the tragedy here.  If Ukraine still had her 2,500 Cold War nukes, Russia would grumble but not attack.  If Ukraine had 790,000 men under arms, 7,000 AFVs and 6,000 MBTs, along with 900 tactical aircraft, Russia might howl but would not attack.

Ukraine wants to live like a woman, not responsible for her own safety and yet refuses to cloister herself, like a nun, from the frankly evil truths of contemporary Western cultural hypocrisy.  If she had agreed to keep to the care of her own corrupt house and not be seduced by Western Influence, Russia never would have attacked, even in 2014.

I \_know\_ what the Russians are like.  Predatory, exploitative, domineering.  Their mafia is their leadership class.  I make no excuse for their actions or their nature.

But from my perspective, it is the Ukrainians who are putting EVERYONE AT RISK, because they will not man up and own the consequences to their prior bad faith acts.

You insult my intelligence when you say 'luck Vova' because-  
'The name Vova is primarily a female name of Russian origin that means Famous Rule.'

It is not a male oriented thing to ask luck to sustain themselves in the face of horrific risk.  We \_act\_ to lessen that risk or at least to leverage it with equal gain as potential loss to the other side of a competed environment.

And yet it is Ukraine that is playing the part of the screaming woman who cries rape most foul, in the face of an attack she has brought upon herself.

This is what an interchange of ideas is. I solicited people to convince me why my idea was wrong. Some people did that effectively, some people didn't.

And what do you think will happen if he fail to control Ukraine? This military operation, as Putin likes to put it (no pun intended) is meant to take over a sovereign country and send a message to the rest of the world at the same time. Why would they want to intentionally appear weak and unorganized? The only explanation would be to pretend to be weak to attract the west to a full blown war that would end the world as we know it. Is that possible? Yes but highly unlikely.  
\&gt;&gt;  
  
Like I said, I don't think Putin is the one rolling this flaming tire uphill.  Because he could literally be off-cuffing it and still be doing better than this 'plan'.

If he's not the one doing it or /telling those who execute the plan/ how to, via an intermediate technocracy, then he may just be a sucker, a patsy, along for the ride.  Someone is certainly advertising Russian insanity.

I know that a nuclear theater war can be won.  Because the proliferation of sub kiloton warheads has allowed for the case of annihilating an airbase but containing the fallout within a 10km square area.  Which does not beget the notion of trading millions as a viable way to avoid thinking about preemptive nuclear escalation.

The easiest way to shut down Western Airpower attempting to enforce an NFZ or staging deep attacks on Putin's supply system (which are the genuine stop-the-attack-not-penalize-it are the real weaknesses here, he's late but his forces are still on plan) is to hit that airpower, on it's base.  Where it actually spends most of it's flying day.

The key is to make it very clear that Russia will skip immediately to strategic yield MIRVs \_on CONUS\_ if there is so much as a single wardet over Russian territory or troops.  So that the U.S. itself is compromised, not Europe.

Polish and Romanian airbases with &lt;1,500 dead will not be traded for 100 million civilians on the Eastern Seaboard.  Will not.

And that further poses a real problem because we only have tactical freefalls in the B61 series to respond with anyway.  And the F-35 is non-penetrating, as a nuclear interdiction platform.  Not against Voronezh/Vostok/Nebo-M.

Conversely, with a full deployment of Growler and F-15/16/22; it's unlikely that even a homeland Russian A2AD complex could stop us from shutting down the campaign with deep attacks on Putin's logistics, both sides of the border.  But the drag of their various pods (ALQ-249, ALQ-131, AAQ-33, ASQ-213) and big missiles (AARGM) means that they have to stage in much closer to the fight.

So, if we push an airpower solution, he has both the necessity and the ability to terminate it with short range missile systems (Iskander, Kh-101) or he will lose.  And yet he doesn't have the HDBT or EB optioned deep stockpiles to do this on a HAS by HAS or even flightline level.  Which means he needs the radiation kill to make those airbases unusable.

  
\&gt;&gt;  
Perhaps Putin's isolated in his own country and is surrounded by yes men that only tell him what he wants to hear? Something far too common with autocrats and usually the reason they fall. We all saw his exchange with Naryshkin. That can't be ignored. Unless, of course, you also think that was a show.  
  
Regardless, Russia right now has a much bigger internal problem to resolve than it had a week ago. Not to mention their kleptocracy demands to be fed and Putin has an increasing number of unsatisfied parasites to please. Good luck Vova.

I agree that the danger to civillians is probably a big factor in this not being recommended so far. I just think at a certain point, the ambient danger level to citizens who want to participate in the fight is so high as to make that danger level acceptable. It's possible we're not there yet, though. This is why, e.g. these explosives are so popular among Muslim extremists.

&gt; Making an EFP out of those isn't practical anyway. Those are particularly dangerous primary explosives. There is a reason why no professionally made explosive uses just primary explosive. Getting enough primary explosive in one place to make an effective EFP is not really possible.

Russia is attempting to take an area roughly the size of the American deep south with only 120,000 troops.

This area is beginning to experience extremely muddy conditions making travel difficult for armored and heavy vehicles. It's populated by 40 million people who are willing to defend themselves.

Ukraine claims to have up to a 900,000 reservists with former military experience due to the requirement for universal male military service.

It has activated those reserves, and is being supplied, daily, with weapons to arm, feed, and equip those reserves.

Meanwhile, the Russian economy is about to experience fairly massive devastation.

Russian supply lines are and have always been extremely shallow. Their soldiers have been looting grocery stores for food, because some units are out of food.

Supplying those units with the mud is about to become difficult. 

The Ukrainians can pick off these armored forces every single day using Javelins and NLAWs, they can hit supply columns with drones, the Russians do not appear to have area security forces in the regions they've passed in the north and there are videos of civilians attacking their supply convoys, and reservists doing the same.

At what point could weather and well armed Ukrainian resistance combine with Russian economic collapse and force a retreat? At what point would Russian troops end up out of food and supplies and be forced to retreat or surrender?

&gt;Kill or capture Zelenski and put in their own puppet government. It doesn't matter if it even looked authentic. 

I have my doubts about that. With the amount of Pro Ukrainian propaganda coming out, i have my doubts if this is true or not. 

&gt; If Russia was clearly in control of the capitol and clearly calling the shots the world would have rolled with it. You cant ship aid to a dead man. 

There is no shortage of people in Ukraine to take the place of Zelenski. While Zelenski is great at social media and media management, the real work is being done by his advisors. 

&gt;And globally the assumption has been that Russia is a near peer of the US.

Since the fall of the fall of the USSR, there has never been an assumption that Russia is a near peer of the US Army. The US Armed Forces are head/shoulders above the rest of the world. The US spends $778 billion on its Armed Forces, let me repeat that number, $778 Billion. There is no peer that even comes close to the might of the US Armed Forces. They defeat Russia in every possible scenario you can wargame in your head. 

&gt;If we took Baghdad in 6 days on the other side of the globe Russia should be able to get Kyiv from Belarus which is two hours away. 

Bad example and it took the US three weeks to take Baghdad, not six days. Iraq was only a shadow of itself with barely any intact defenses. They barely had a functioning Air Force, Air Defense or even any decent tanks or ATGMS to attack the Americans. The US spent a whole month carpet bombing Iraq and destroyed anything of value. When the US invaded, they were absolutely ferocious and made full use of combined arms using massive cruise missiles, airstrikes and artillery strikes. On the other hand, Russia has shown extreme restraint in terms of the firepower they use to avoid any civilian casualties because they consider Ukrainians slavs, a handicap the US did not have. Russian Army has a fraction of the resources the US Army has, not to mention Ukraine is armed with the best ATGM's and MANPAD's with massive continued aid coming from the West. Iraq had no support what so ever.   


&gt;If they had quickly taken the capitol the assumption would have been that the war is over and deal with the new normal.

It was just wrong about the details. The ingredients are present in bulk in Ukrainian cities. The process is easy for an amateur to execute.

The arguments *against* doing this are simple:

- These are highly sensitive explosives that are very dangerous to handle in quantity, even for experts.
- The process is more complex, which will elicit a lower rate of citizen participation. If your goal is just participation and morale, it's a bad idea.
- It's possible they already have large, decentralized stockpiles of real anti-tank weapons cached in their major cities. Credit to [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t48e0p/ukraine_megathread_march_1/hyyj36m/?context=3) for pointing that out.

They didn't take Helsinki and they did take vastly more casualties than the Finns. Had they continued the war past March, it's likely they could have taken Helsinki since the Mannerheim line had been thoroughly broken and the Finns had been pushed back in Petsamo.  The treaty was signed while the Soviets were in the suburbs of Vyborg and had already landed troops west of the city. 

Maybe if the spring thaw came very early the Soviets would have gotten bogged down before reaching Helsinki. But the Finns had little in the way of troops between the landings west of Vyborg and the capital. The roads between those cities were also much better than the frontier roads the Soviets had to deal with at the start of the war.

I think they stopped mainly for 3 reasons:

-Soviets got what they wanted; they didn't even ask for Vyborg before the war, just moving the border to 20mi east of Vyborg in exchange for twice as much land elsewhere. They ended with all of Viipuri, and chunks of Petsamo and Salla

-Going further would give the Soviets a longer and less defensible border + coastline

-Soviets didn't want to waste more men/equipment fighting and didn't want to get bogged down (either in the spring thaw or a guerilla war)",711ec6b07845dec8e2360c65c8bb12da750c1258,True,False,,,,,0,1646167870,,0,{},hyyjx5f,False,t3_t3jwpe,False,True,t1_hywmkd8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3jwpe/the_mysterious_case_of_the_missing_russian_air/hyyjx5f/,1646167882,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646139070.0,

Long answer: I've seen the line over and over that the rapid Russian advance is due to a strategy of fluid defense and harassing Russian lines of communication while retreating into the countryside and fortifying cities. However that doesn't explain why they haven't done that in the east, where their force concentration is the greatest and presumably most vulnerable to superior Russian support weapons (estimates before the war were that half or more of Ukraine's forces were in or around Donbas). Moreover, Kyiv clearly has an acute lack of regular defenders, evidenced by the fact that they are distributing arms to civilians and even prison inmates (in contrast they haven't resorted to that in Kharkiv, where there's a lot of evidence of an organized Ukrainian defense). They absolutely would not be doing that if the situation there wasn't critical.

One under-reported item from the first day of the war was the destruction of a transiting AFU battalion+ in Kherson oblast by the RuAF. That's evidence that the threat of Russian air interdiction may be seriously impairing Ukrainian operational mobility and preventing them from shifting forces around as they want. Their forces in Donbas are imminently threatened with envelopment and the obvious move now is to retreat and shorten the line, but that doesn't appear to be happening yet. It seems the Ukrainian commander either has strict orders to hold his position or that he thinks that he cannot risk withdrawal even if that causes his forces to encircled.",b23d24ae0ece9ad303c7c0f640a58114941081bc,True,False,,,,,0,1646164767,,0,{},hyybtlb,False,t3_t44kwj,False,True,t3_t44kwj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t44kwj/where_do_you_think_the_majority_of_ukrainian/hyybtlb/,1646164784,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646135967.0,

Considering that, the target audience of the Tweets is skewed in the direction of people who may be less willing or able to play army. So, it makes sense that they'd be a more modest ask.

Ya, that's valid, but it seems strange to direct people to physically assault soldiers and armored vehicles in a way that makes them combatants, but in a way that isn't designed to effectively neutralize them. Seems like the worst of all possible worlds to me.

&gt; You also mentioned that it's stuff that's available in a hardware store... that might actually be kind of a high bar. This may be a context where people are afraid to leave their home and may be unable to get fuel to drive places. So, it may be difficult to get to a hardware store which might be closed and locked. Do they break in and take the supplies? ""Go to the hardware store"" may be a substantial thing to ask of a person, while making a molotov may be doable from what the average person has at their house or in their neighborhood, not just at the hardware store.

I feel like this actually supports what i'm saying even more. Gasoline has dual use. They need to save that for their cars to be able to get around. Getting gasoline shouldn't be much easier than the supplies in a hardware store. As I understand it, many grocery stores and similar are still operating, I don't think the HW store owners would mind people breaking in and stealing supplies for this purpose.

&gt; This conversation thread has basically boiled down to: if you suggest molotovs more people are likely to do it because it's easier and less intimidating, but the actual combat effect might be smaller. Assuming that's true, what if the point isn't the combat effect? What if both are unlikely to make a big combat difference? Then it becomes all about psychology. And while another comment pointed out that from the POV of the Russians lots of molotovs flying in has a much more ""the people are against us"" effect than a few manufactured explosives which is more ""the soldiers are against us"", I think there is also the opposite direction. The first act of violence a person commits in a war is the hardest and it'll get easier each time. In that sense, if you're looking to turn your population into a fighting force, it may be smarter in the long run to get as many people as possible to do ANY act of violence (even if it's ineffective) than it is to get a handful of them to do much more effective things.

I agree, and I think they should be suggesting a range of options for that purpose. I just think in that range, they should be listing some ""slightly more advanced"" but likely to be effective, types of munitions. These devices were quite effective against the US occupation in Iraq, and they're likely to be even more so here if deployed well.

I don't want to suggest that they should stop talking about Molotov's entirely, I just think they need to expand that conversation a bit.",ef5cf8283f197524a966259c511a107ab1b72a17,True,False,,,,,0,1646163495,,0,{},hyy8iru,False,t3_t48e0p,False,True,t1_hyy78np,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t48e0p/ukraine_megathread_march_1/hyy8iru/,1646163510,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646134695.0,

(a) Zelensky asks for the West to airlift humanitarian supplies into the city via Sikorsky airport.

(b) The West (perhaps remembering the Berlin airlift) obliges, and tells Russia that it will do this, specifying flight plans etc..

(c) Russia then accuses the West of using the airlift to bring in military supplies, and shoots down a Western plane.

A coup would be very difficult to pull off and it would be risky for the Russian elites since the system depends heavily on Putin as a mediator between different factions and interest groups and there isn't anyone else who can fill that role as well as Putin does. If Putin has actually lost his mind (say, he's willing to order a nuclear first strike on NATO countries) then there probably will be a coup, if not then I'm not sure.

As far as if there are any actions right now, there's no way to know. We won't see any sign of a coup in advance (because if he can see that one's coming then Putin will take steps to stop it), rather if there is a coup then we'll read one day that Putin has had a heart attack or retired to his Dacha and that President Shoygu is open to negotiations with Ukraine. If there's a failed coup then we'll see Putin suddenly fire top advisors Shoygu, Gerasimov, or Naryshkin.

One positive development is that some oligarchs like Deripaska have spoken out against the war. They can't do anything on their own (Putin's power is in the siloviki, not the oligarchs), but Deripaska is well-connected politically and it's risky for him to say anything.

People seem so cocksure that Russia is suffering major casualties, losing logistical capabilities, and losing morale, which all might be true in certain circumstances. People are also certain that the Ghost of Kyiv is real and that the Snake Island 13 died as martyrs in defiance.

Truth is that Ukraine will offer heavy resistance in both military and civilian context, but we are still a week into a months long conflict.

During the Cold War 100% yes because NATO knew they couldn't win without nukes, but in the present I'm sure there's a clear preplanned nuclear escalation policy in the event of invasion or capture of a member state's capital or just too many losses or whatever.

Soviet policy was to use nukes immediately for tactical purposes; modern Russian doctrine keeps that and also uses ""escalate to de-escalate"" where disproportionally strong nuclear strikes are used to force the other side to the bargaining table.

I think the main thing is Molotovs can be created quickly from materials that are already on hand *in abundance* in Ukrainian cities with little expertise or instruction needed.

I'm not sure what's involved with manufacturing what you suggest, but my guess why they're not using that approach is that they either don't have an abundance of precursor materials or they don't believe instructions could be easily communicated en masse.

You'd have to do the math on your method (materials consumption per charge, average amount available per 100k population) and compare to the molotov.  I'd guess it comes down to molotov being easier to produce in large quantities compared to other options.

Molotovs are terrible weapons against even a moderately armored vehicle. Real armies use EFPs for this purpose, but making shitty makeshift ones isn't actually that hard. They won't be nearly as good as real military grade ones, but they will be much better than Molotovs.

* The Russians don't have a very effective air force compared to western standards. They only have a few precision munitions and most have been used. The remaining forces are for air superiority only - of which they've mostly achieved (Ukraine is not operating big jets in any meaningful numbers). So their air force has largely performed the main function,. 
* Helicopters are very vulnerable to manpads, so Russians have to use them sparingly. Two were shot down today alone.
* Russia is afraid of invasion from elsewhere and holding their air force in reserve. This whole invasion is an indication of Russia paranoia. Holding the majority of their air force in reserve means that it'll be able to support troops on a defense basis if they are attacked on their enormous border. Air power is one of their only capabilities that could be moved to cover their entire territory quickly. 

I think the last point is one that is often missed in analysis. I think it is an important one as Russia will be looking at uprisings throughout their border region. And other countries may take Russia's weakness in Ukraine as an opportunity for a land grab.

The first way we heard about the existence of nukes was them being used to conquer a non-nuclear country. There is a reason China or Russia could not simply decide to ""step in"" and institute a no fly zone over Iraq during the US invasion, or over Libya during the US operations there, or over Syria during the US invasion, etc. Because doing so would be shooting down US planes, which would be a declaration of war on the US, and nuclear powers cannot be allowed to declare war on each other. I'd prefer civil war in any country that got seriously close, it would pose less risk to the world even with the possibility of nukes getting loose.


This is what nuclear weapons means, what they have always meant. In the real world we have to live with distasteful things because the alternative is nuclear annihilation of hundreds of millions of people. I'm not personally at direct risk - I'm not in America, Russia, Europe or China so I'm not in the blast zone. But I'm a human being who cares about the billions of people that do live in nuclear polities and would more than likely die on the first day of WW3. And selfishly, the rest of the world including me is going to be living with mass starvation, more refugees than can be transported before deaths start, a completely collapsed economy, very likely limited utilities like water and electricity, no internet, etc. That's not a future I want, so no, the US declaring war on Russia over Ukraine is not a reasonable request. There are clear limits to what each nuclear actor can do; Russia cannot attack NATO, NATO cannot attack Russia, neither can attack China and China can't attack either.

***Why*** did they assume they would meet so little resistance? Why did they assume that they could abandon how they are trained/drilled to fight? To me, this speaks to a larger problem of the Russians reading their own press releases and believing their own propaganda. They fundamentally failed to understand the operating environment that they were wading into. That speaks to a more systemic problem in their formation and with their intelligence and IO initiatives. 

In addition, there have been glaring problems on the ground. 

-Deep, unsupported airborne and air assault operations unsupported by follow-on forces or SEAD packages. 

-Systemic logistics issues at the tactical level. 

-Improper COMSEC allows adversaries to have a good operational picture of exactly what they are up to. 

-Poor discipline and morale issues at the Plt/Co/BN level.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"Even if they stay as well-organized BTGs, one of the huge issues with that formation is that it's very light on recon and maneuver elements.  This is tolerable when on the defense or when fighting set-piece battles with local proxy forces manning the line of contact. But on the advance, the formation is incapable of both covering its own flanks and bringing decisive force to bear on the objective. The BTG is a great unit if you want to send in some forces to stiffen proxy forces' lines in a long-running, medium to low intensity conflict that sees limited maneuver. It's not so great for what the Russians are trying to do right now, though.

The Russian invasion force of about 200,000 troops sounds large, but is actually quite small for the length of the front and area of the territory it seeks to control. In 1941, the Axis powers fielded roughly 1.5 million troops (Army Group South) to invade and control roughly the same territory, and even with that much higher density of forces they still had constant problems with rear-area security.

Combine those two factors and the Russian force will continue to struggle to actually *control* territory, or even fully control the supposed front line.

That means that for Ukrainian forces, it makes sense to conduct a more fluid defense. The goal isn't to prevent Russian forces from advancing; it's to inflict casualties on the Russians, interdict their supplies and reinforcements, and generally force them to try to defend everywhere at once while also advancing toward objectives (which, again, the Russian units of maneuver aren't capable of doing). This means both the sort of dispersed small unit defense by light infantry with man-portable anti-tank weapons that we're seeing evidence of, but also larger operations like [Zabrodskyi's Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Raid_of_2014) in 2014, in which an air assault brigade (augmented with enough AFVs that it was more of a mechanized brigade) conducted an 11-day, 170km raid behind enemy lines in which they destroyed enemy supply trains, relieved isolated friendly positions (recovering 3000 troops and 250 pieces of heavy equipment), and generally wreaked havoc.

That's also why I'm not as concerned as others with the possibility of Russian forces surrounding Ukrainian forces in Donbas. The Russians don't have the forces available to actually *encircle* the Ukrainians - especially not if they're also simultaneously assaulting Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson. If they try, they'll just be stretching themselves even more thinly and exposing their rear areas to more raids.",a276f3d35c16d6b4f05d38d8d05075538951eac9,True,False,,,,,0,1646150400,,0,{},hyxapz2,False,t3_t44kwj,False,True,t1_hywspod,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t44kwj/where_do_you_think_the_majority_of_ukrainian/hyxapz2/,1646150412,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646121600.0,

Writing it down and posting here is already a great step forward. 

I can give you a few hints. Avoiding emotional triggers helps alleviate symptoms as you already found out. That’s only a short term and limited strategy. You will only overcome this by reflection, controlled exposition, and developing new strategies to deal with this. 

Limiting your exposure is certainly helpful. But you can try to expose yourself for a limited time. Like look at one news article and then stay with it until your feelings of anxiety lessen. 

Reflection is a very powerful tool. Writing this text is already that. Talking about it with someone who’s able to listen and accept you helps. This is what a therapist does really well. Writing down your thoughts and feelings in a diary will help you better understand yourself and give you a place to put your stuff. 

And don’t forget to take good care of yourself otherwise. Just avoiding bad stuff only gets you so far. Do something nice for yourself. Spend quality time with loved ones, do sports, create something, etc.

You're probably mostly right. I say ""mostly"" because a large amount of expenditure is indeed on things like salaries that are paid in rubles, but there's also a significant amount of money that has to be spent in training engineers and purchasing equipment. Many weapons are domestically manufactured, but the toolkits, machinery and electronics (and indirectly, even all the material needed to train engineers) all has to be bought and sold on the tech market, which is closer to pricing in USD rather than pricing in rubles. Cellphones and laptops are soon going to get way more expensive for Russians, and you would expect this to affect the military budget as well (even if only by a little).

Agreed  


&gt;Russia has failed at establishing air superiority from day one,

Agreed, they have local air superiority but certainly no air superiority across the country. But the counter point to this would be, they didn't have time to establish it. It took NATO more then a month to establish air superiority in Iraq, and Iraq had only a fraction of the resources that the Ukrainian Air Force has. Not to mention, Ukrainians are relying on isolated asymmetric TB2 strikes, i am not seeing Ukrainian MIG 29's or SU27's challenging the Russian SU35's in the air.   


&gt;failed to take and replace the government

Replace the Government in less then a week? The largest country in Europe with a population of 44 million. It took the Americans more then a month to fully conquer Iraq and you expect Russia, with a fraction of American resources to take Ukraine in less then a week. Not to mention, Iraq had barely any defenses left in 2003 while the Ukrainians are armed with some of the best ATGM's and MANPAD's in the world.   


&gt;and failed to take major objectives.

Kiev, Kharkov and Mariupol are under siege. The Russian pincers are moving to trap the 45K Ukrainian troops deployed in the East. Its less then a week for pete sakes.  


&gt;Russia seems to be failing there. Likely this entire war is based on bad assumptions that 1000s will die to expose.  

No doubt about that. The incompetence on the Russian end is mind blowing. But then again, the Russian Army was/is not designed and drilled to fight a war like that.

Sounds like the thing you should be doing, the west has everything to gain from bullying Russia but not nearly as much from facing a direct peer in China. 

China has a rapidly growing economy, they have a population of 1.4 billion, meaning that in order to match the US's GDP they only need 1/4 the GDP per capita and for their GDP to be twice that of the US they only need half the US's GDP per capita. Their companies are rising up the value chain, moving from creating knockoff products to innovations which can compete. 10 years ago Chinese phones were rarely seen, now Huawei and Oppo compete with the likes of Samsung and Apple. China is the only place on earth which can rival Silicon Valley. China has a huge industrial capacity, a huge civilian shipbuilding industry which could be repurposed to help their navy in the event of a war with the US. They produce more steel than the rest of the world combined. Their navy is rapidly growing, their military becomes stronger and stronger.

Russia on the other hand, isn't a rising power, their population is less than that of the US, their economy isn't impressive, they don't have companies rapidly ascending the value chain, they don't stand a chance at overtaking the US.

Putin does not present himself as an unwise man, unable to present a coherent argument.  (Joe Biden now...)

Yet his words in the past few weeks have been at times paranoidally abstruse if not non-sensical.

Has he been dosed with something?

There was a big set of announcements, for almost 48hrs straight, which made Chernobyl sound like more than an industrial waste site.

Fighting to hold onto an unoccupied zone?  Taking hostages from the monitoring staff?  Increased radiation outputs?  What?  Is someone trying to cook up a nuke from all the fuel sold back and forth?  Is that why it was important to announce the Russians now held the site?

It takes power and a lot of it, to maintain computers, a video room (lighting green screen etc.) and support crew on multiple hotel floors plus a satellite uplink back to the world.  Easily double the average household's daily 30kw/h.  We're talking a generator and tanker truck to sustain even just a few days, if the power goes down.  If stifling the news is important, to hide the shame/sham/bloodiness of what is happening, why is it that Kiev has continued to have power?

Since the Russians have drones that deliberate intercept both COMINT and RADINT to direct artillery fire, it should be easy to localize where the CNN crews are.  And kill them with an 'errant SAM' missile strike.

And yet the news continues to flow.

Putin looks pale and tired.  But his expression is one of distaste, bordering on contempt.  Like he's undertaking a task he doesn't want to do.  Why?  Is someone ordering him?  Who?  Who has more power than the head of state of a super power?

Zelensky says there are absolutely no infiltrators in Kiev.  Yet there is a permanent curfew now.  Which only makes sense if you have something like Gorgon Stare or Argus IS feeding a top down video tracker looking for moving hot spots across the face of an entire metro zone.  Tracking down Russian Spetz teams all throughout the city.

Population is an enemy as much as a recruitment pool.  There are 2.88 million in Kiev who, at around 1,650 calories (basal) per day, need 4,752,000,000 calories to survive.  Every day.

Why haven't Spetz cued rocket attacks on food stores?  Why hasn't Putin cut road/rail lines into/out of the city?  If you want to avoid having to shell them into submission, as Hitler did to the Poles who blew raspberries in his general's direction when the Nazi armies surrounded Warsaw, you need to start working on their slow starvation instead.

Starvation weakens will over days.  Composition B separates body parts, instantly.

Where is our first Mortain, our first Falaise?  There is supposedly a 20 mile long convoy of vehicles, 15nm outside of the Capital.  For any delaying action to work it has to functionally serve to buy time.  So that heavy units can move into the capital area and even if they are only towed mounts which are almost immediately counter batteried, still fork-done \_pre-registered\_ fires which include some portion of the roads where these vehicles are all staged up.

With Javelins, you take out the front and back of the convoy.  And then popup little whackamole gophers with RPG to shatter the vehicles caught in a terrain choke, inbetween.

if the Kiev regime is winning (and the Russians are so careless as to bunch up), there should be literally dozens of scenes, easily visible to satellite imagery, which look like Route 80 between Kuwait City and Basra.

Having gone through that, why are the Russians now collectivized as they approach an urban defense ring with dug in artillery in camouflage positions etc.

Again, \_this is not new\_.  Back in 2015, a couple of battalions prepared to trade positions on a front near the Donbas, a Russian drone, with thermals, saw them pull up and did a 10-10-10 strike on them which ended up butchering 60 odd vehicles in a couple minutes of concentrated bombardment.

All because the Ukrainians did not move into dispersals as soon as they arrived.  At Debaltseve, \_in a single battle\_ the Ukrainians lost 100+ MBT, 250 AFV, 200+ tubes of mixed artillery and over 700 other vehicles.  That's more than the number of 'NATO' MBCT in all the Baltic States \_combined\_.

Ukrainian mechanized forces outside of the single 17ABr \_does not exist\_ because we would not generate matching capabilities to allow them to /defend/ their positions rather than be pocketed and then rolled up.

This is not fear of escalation.  Because it was happening on Ukrainian territory and it was happening after Russian forces attacked.

So with all this, why aren't the Ukrainians looking for a little payback?  Why are the Russians stepping into the same 6:1 casualty rate conditions they dealt out, throughout the 2014-15 period of highest intensity combat by refusing to advance into prepared defensive positions rather than forcing the Ukrainians off of them with artillery and then pocketing and annihilating them, in the bypass?

In terms of intensity, Ukraine, in 2014, was \_worse\_ than Golan in 1973.  And the Russians won anyway.

Yet their current losses will continue to get worse because Putin is nominally acting like an idiot, spreading diversionary forces around, rather than priming the pump on the single Guards Army he can afford to logistically support and screen for, in taking his sweet own time to decapitate the Kievan regime.

Just 8 years ago, they did not play at war like this.  They are acting like children.   

Indeed, to me, too many actors are playing to a common script that forces a larger war effort.  One which could end up costing millions of lives and which will happen because a brutal and short campaign is being traded for a tentative and prolonged equivalent which cannot help but lead to that nightmare horror show of the common soldier known as 'Decisive Battle'.

Putin may well have missed his decisive window of initiative.  But even if he hasn't, he is rolling into that 6:1 LER Lanchestrian grind.  Without a seeming battle plan in place to win without being Decisively Engaged with casualties which amount to an excuse to bring in NATO.

At which point, I can only think the worst.  As a whose-on-first condition of replacements stepping into the void of a post nuclear exchange.  'They' are the ones orchestrating this.  They are the ones who will benefit from failure, on all sides, to fight the war to win.

Not all at once.  But with graduated, ongoing, pain that forces the weakened submission rather than the decisive win.

The problem is, I don't know who 'They' are beyond stating they are clearly supra nationalist.  Acting beyond state interests.  And the only group I can think of who meets that spec were the ones who stated it would be okay to kill two thirds of the planetary population if it resulted in the perfection of Communism for the rest.

Like others have pointed out, one is a counter insurgency campaign where the Russians were only providing air support and SOF trainers to a government and the other is a full scale invasion against a near-peer  adversary.   

Now coming to Ukraine, I wouldn't make any judgements right now given it's only been 5 days since the conflict began and most conflicts take longer to play out. The fog of war is real and we have no idea how the Ukrainians are doing as all we see is what the Ukraine and the West wants everyone to see. Most major platforms have been flooded with Russian losses and information about their locations and movements. 

It's hard to get any confirmation about Russian gains or engagements where've managed to beat the Ukrainians. Now we don't know for sure what is happening but even if the Russians suffered half the reported losses in man power it is a major blow. 

## So why are their losses this big?

Given the limited and extremely biased information at hand the best explanations I've seen is that the Ukrainians have adopted tactics which has been able to counter the Russian approach to war i.e. break through operations followed by mechanized assault into the rear areas. The Ukrainian infantry have stayed back allowing the Russians to pass once they are in the Ukrainians have been ambushing support elements and then talking out the first echelon which would have run out of supplies in their deep push into Ukrainian territory. This explanation seems to be true about what's happening in the North and North East but we don't know how things are actually going in the South and South East, near the separatist held areas.   

The Russians seem have sent in their conscripts instead of the Professionals which is a odd choice given the political ramifications that comes with conscript deaths back home. They don't seem to fighting in Battalion tactical groups and employing mass artillery fires which is something they have a major advantage in. The Air Defense hasn't been up to the same standard as we saw during the 2014-15 conflict days where they made one of the best IADS employing small AA infantry teams with MANPADS to long range systems like the S400 which made the Ukrainian Airforce and CAS assets useless. What we are seeing now is footage reminiscent of the strikes against Russian assets in Syria where Bayraktar drones have been making a big killing targeting unprotected assets like trucks.    

The professional soldiers who make up VDV units went into battle as tank desants who relied on massive arty support integrated with UAVs, from small quad copters to MALE Drones up in the sky. A part of the reason why they are not using their ISR assets could be that the missile strikes against airbases and the SEAD missions they launched weren't really effective given the fact that most of the strikes didn't inflict the kind of damage they expected because most were done by Ballistic and Cruise missiles. The SEAD missions did take out some radars but the Ukrainian IR SAMS and MANPADS are still active.

Last Wednesday, a few hours before Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine, alarms went off inside Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, warning of a never-before-seen piece of “wiper” malware that appeared aimed at the country’s government ministries and financial institutions.

Within three hours, Microsoft threw itself into the middle of a ground war in Europe — from 5,500 miles away. The threat center, north of Seattle, had been on high alert, and it quickly picked apart the malware, named it “FoxBlade” and notified Ukraine’s top cyberdefense authority. Within three hours, Microsoft’s virus detection systems had been updated to block the code, which erases — “wipes” — data on computers in a network.

Then Tom Burt, the senior Microsoft executive who oversees the company’s effort to counter major cyberattacks, contacted Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber- and emerging technologies. Ms. Neuberger asked if Microsoft would consider sharing details of the code with the Baltics, Poland and other European nations, out of fear that the malware would spread beyond Ukraine’s borders, crippling the military alliance or hitting West European banks.

Before midnight in Washington, Ms. Neuberger had made introductions — and Microsoft had begun playing the role that Ford Motor Company did in World War II, when the company converted automobile production lines to make Sherman tanks.

After years of discussions in Washington and in tech circles about the need for public-private partnerships to combat destructive cyberattacks, the war in Ukraine is stress-testing the system. The White House, armed with intelligence from the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, is overseeing classified briefings on Russia’s cyberoffensive plans. Even if American intelligence agencies picked up on the kind of crippling cyberattacks that someone — presumably Russian intelligence agencies or hackers — threw at Ukraine’s government, they do not have the infrastructure to move that fast to block them.",e9db344a4e7bafb2ee0de1c7540b81099c17aa8b,True,False,,,,,0,1646142230,,0,{},hyws6ui,False,t3_t3fpvo,False,True,t1_hywqtnz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/ukraine_megathread_february_28/hyws6ui/,1646142245,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646113430.0,

The problem with Russia's strategy is their lack of intel; from what Ive heard the timing of this invasion was based on social related matters (which was gathered flawedly at best). Their refusal to believe that resistance would occur &amp; distribution of advanced Anti-tank or air weapons is another reason too (There are very little systems that exist even within the west that can deal with Top-down attacks; only APS or recently developed ERA blocks).  Claiming air superiority &amp; inability to destroy air defense systems is another problem too considering that prior to the invasion they were being moved.

The irony is that Russia is capable of gathering quality intel; without a doubt they have satellite imagery, drones and SOPs for gathering &amp; reporting of movement &amp; troops. However It is likely that due to either over-confidence, lack of planning/preparation is what lead to this.

a) They figured they wouldn't need massive air power since they were counting on a decapitation strike with standoff weapons at the beginning to take out the Ukrainian air force. Basically they completely underestimate Ukraine. 

b) There has been little in the way of heavy weapon usage generally. Its only now that we are starting to see heavy artillery usage. Russia is towing a fine line between what it can get away with and putting the international community in a position they cannot afford not to intervene. He also has internal narratives to consider since he wants to position the Russian operation as a liberation effort. Bombing Ukraine like Aleppo to dust is not a good look for him and very hard to hide. This suggests the objective is a favorable political settlement rather than a drawn out conflict and occupation.

c) Given the general lack of disorganization displayed I am seriously skeptical they have the ability to coordinate heavy SAM usage with Russian air operations without the occasional blue on blue shoot downs.

1. Managing international fallout: Russia’s economy is a lot more insulated from sanctions when compared to China whose entire economic rise and economy to this day is built on trade and exports.  These sanctions would do a lot more to cripple China than Russia

2. While one may point out China is ahead of Russia in tech, I don’t think it’s fair to say Russia half assed this invasion.  Maybe you know something I don’t? Why do you say they half assed it?  

Regardless here’s what matters: Ukraine is a flat country on Russia’s border.  Physically getting troops into the battle space is a simple matter of crossing a border and keeping supply lines open

Taiwan is a island, filled with people who appear to be equally determined as Ukraine to keep their independence.  Amphibious assaults are one of the hardest most complex military operations one can attempt.  And on top of it they have to keep the waters secure to resupply troops, and the US Navy is still light years ahead of the Chinese navy so idk how they plan to mitigate that, and even so they’d also need air superiority to ensure safe resupply we.  Just placing the Air Force in Taiwan combined with Taiwan’s Air Force there’s no way China could get air superiority, the second biggest Air Force in the world is the US navy


Moral of the story is if Russia can’t complete a simple border crossing invasion into a flat country how is China going to take a heavily defended island?

The Air domain changes in the blink of an eye and so the ability to not target friendlies while being able to shoot effectively at hostiles is extremely difficult to do without friendly fire incidents, even if they don't result in any deaths.

Russia does not have the ability to operate in a JEZ, even if they had air supremacy. Until the Ukrainian IADS is completely destroyed (excluding Stinger missiles), meaning the destruction of tactical and strategic SAMs and all intercept aircraft, the VKS is simply not ready to fly into a highly contested airspace, especially since the Ukrainians fly, well, much of the same equipment. The VKS would lose billions of dollars in aircraft, and you can't patch up modern aircraft the same way you once could.

The VKS will likely embark on a large scale support campaign once the Ukrainian IADS are largely disabled, but until then they're going to sit tight and hear about how poorly everything's going on the ground.",d1928fb5a72a64840f191bc9641e102df35ee5a9,True,False,,,,,0,1646136894,,0,{},hywirwn,False,t3_t3jwpe,False,True,t3_t3jwpe,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3jwpe/the_mysterious_case_of_the_missing_russian_air/hywirwn/,1646136906,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646108094.0,

Given the issues they had procuring t-14's (3.7) mil, and that to my knowledge they have refused to deploy any of the small number they have, fear of asset loss is not an unreasonable assumption. They seem increasingly unable to replace lost hardware.

No sign of helicopters being used to both aircav directly and, in the face of ambush forces, to shuttle in leap frogging SR teams to do road watch.

I would disagree with the assessment that VDV cannot be usefully employed to seize and hold a given area but they have to be reinforced with immediate CAS/SEAD to hold open an air corridor so that cargo aircraft can roll off a steady stream of vehicles to expand the APOD into a genuine threat to \_Ukrainian\_ rear areas and transport systems.

Very early on.

To keep the rats from fleeing a sinking ship, you want to shut down the Ukranian highway system and with reregistered mortar and ATGW fire, this is relatively easy to do but you have to hold what you seize so that you don't lose just huge amounts of Il-76 trying to sustain that forward threat.

It took just a few days for Soviet Armor and Airborne to link up in Afghanistan and there is no reason this could not be true here, across much shorter border-to-COG distances, \_if you act like you are serious\_ in pushing a LIMITED spearhead force to seize the Capital only.

These are not the heady days of the Soviet Union, you don't have large tank armies so secondary attacks are pointless.  There is no surprise here.  Put supplies and heavy security on your thrustline and sustain tempo until you are moving faster than the threat can react to keep up as you kill them in the must-be-mounted-to-stay-relevant approach to contact phase. 

Some areas are not going to be easily bypassed due to cross roads and bridges and there you need to roll hard and heavy with preparatory artillery missions on likely ambush points and fielded VDV air assault forces to rush in and seize key objectives as your forces push in to secure cross roads.

Since it is my belief that black ops SOF are the actual shooters on the majority of SLM/CCWS systems in the area and since their presence cannot afford to be caught and crushed as foreign interventionalists, they will be operating out of these urban areas.  And Putin should have had his entire UAV COMINT/EW force up, looking for key signature emissions to both capture these units and turn off the distribution spigot of air delivered munitions into theater.

Ukraine is corrupt as hell and so maintaining positive control on those weapons is critical, just as it was in Afghanistan, with Stingers.

The West does not want to be direct-delivering 175,000 dollar Javelins and 265,000 dollar CLUs into a void of an 'unknown end user' like they were a glorified Amazon delivery service.

SOF gives you tight receiver control on delivery of penny packets of munitions, as and where needed (50lb Javelin, 25lb NLAW) while staying away from fluid conditions on the roadnet where tooling about gets you in shot at by all sides.

Think about this, and what it means.  We are directly aiding a foreign combatant against a nuclear threat state.

I doubt, seriously, if Zelensky is now in Kiev and possibly not even in Ukraine (marvels of digital video...) but a Zelensky who cannot control his immediate metro surroundings to the ravening of wolves among the sheep as an airborne element in his rear is a Zelensky who is entirely dependent upon CV-22 delivery of munitions and fundamental (satcomms, jammers = batteries plus a reliably competent security force and early warning feeds) support to avoid being isolated behind a wall of Russian cyber and EW and hard kill attack on his comms grid.

Kiev should have been a dark city from night one.  Including any and all newsfeeds coming out of the city.  It's still winter over there, which means it's cold at night.  No power, no water, no radio/tv/internet = no connection and social cohesion begins to break down, no matter how brave the scripted words of a PR campaign may seem to be. 

The Russians haven't been doing any of this.  Which is so completely inane, because, in the 2014-2018 period, \_they did it all the time\_.  It's not like they don't know how.  And given what he has at stake, KGB Putin would not be at all concerned with Ukrainian losses.

ARGUMENT:  
I am increasingly of the view that this is a tail wag dog, powerpoint, operation, designed as much to grab the attention of a bored and jaded West, distracting them from the truths of their own political tyrannies with a huge distraction op.

On the Ukrainian side:  There should be massive evidence of fallen government buildings.  Collapsed bridges and destroyed rail lines.  Failed utilities.  Starving populations trapped behind cratered road nets.  Freezing in the dark.

Artillery fire should sound like constant rolling thunder, every time a mechanized force gets even close to a potentially contested area.

Kiev in particular should be divided and dark, without essential services, transport access and food distribution.  Because such is the tools of compression by which you 'change their minds' in a 4GW sense of encroaching doom as lost hope.

For the Russians: Every time you see \_more than a few\_ vehicles, there should be equal evidence of charred corpses as there was, all over the battlefields of 1991 and particularly the highway of death and again during the sponsored terrorism of Syria.

People run away from vehicles on fire, even if it means they tumble, already dead, from turret that is already jetting gouts of flame.  Real War is not nearly as clean as is being presented in the major media and even Twitter footage.

It can't be.  If you are only stopping 1-2 vehicles every 10-20 kilometers, that's not even desultory, artillery mission level, attrition.  And yet you \_must be\_ ambushing whole convoys to slow the Russian logistics in particular, this much.

The Russians aren't moving across country to avoid partisan or main force attack with brilliant top attack munitions.  Probably because they can't.

Yet they also aren't getting Falaised at every turn in the road with some builtup cover or a treeline because there is no visual evidence of 20-40-60 vehicles being head and tailed with Javelins and everything in-between slaughtered by close attack with RPG and NLAW.

But they are supposedly being held up by a lack of logistics that slows a 205nm advance from the border to Kiev into it's second week.  Something which should take, even a remnant Soviet era force, 4-5 days against the most bitter of opposition.

Huge amounts of armor and helicopters remain uncommitted to the fight.  Something normal only when there are vast POL discrepancies or spares shortages which prevent their being FMC.

CONCLUSION:  
Something is fatally flawed here.  We are being sold a bill of goods.  This is not how the Russians fight.  This is not how Putin would commit forces in an all or nothing campaign whose outcome will most assuredly destroy his own political position and probably that of a united Russia, if it fails.

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.
The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to fight for it with the Atlantic bloc.

Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations
Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022
Yesterday, 18:25
Russia formed a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine
Did anyone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.
More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

Focusing on the units/equipment that enable Russian maneuver (Used here doctrinally as the combination of fires and movement), would be paramount to ensuring Kyiv stands.

If I was put in charge of an operation to degrade the convoy, my targeting matrix would be as follows:

1. Signal and Command Assets
2. Air Defense Artillery (ADA)
3. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) carrying logistics vehicles
4. Engineering Assets (Excavators, mine clearers, bridge layers)
5. Other Logistics transport
6. Combat Arms Units (Engaged in order of most casualty producing to least casualty producing)

Signal and Command being knocked out would degrade the column's command and control (C2) capabilities. The Russian Armed forces are notorious for being top heavy on officers, who are needed to drive operations. The importance of destroying ADA was outlined in my previous posts. Destroying POL vehicles would deny fuel supplies to the front, shown to be devastating already. Furthermore, if you want to look more on how that would impact the Russian supply line along the Kyiv axis, I suggest you read my post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/comment/hyvcj65/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/comment/hyvcj65/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Destruction of engineering assets would deny the Russians the ability to conduct wet gap crossings, emplace defenses, or degrade Ukrainian defenses. Logistics transports are self explanatory. Combat arms units are last here because they can make their way to Kyiv, but without logistical support, they won't have the ability to sustain combat operations for long.

I don't doubt that the Ukrainians are trying to disrupt the convoy, but we have to remember a couple of things:

1) The Ukrainian forces have been conducting excellent OPSEC.

2) The Ukrainian government has been focused on releasing the results of SUCCESSFUL operations to garner international public support.

3) An operation like this carries a lot of risk for the AT teams. Targets on their priority list may not have shown themselves yet, or further reconnaissance needs to be done.

4) The Russians may actually be adapting and properly conducting flank guard operations for their supply lines. This adds another layer to the challenge above, as any AT forces now have to avoid detection by screening forces.

This list is not exhaustive, and there are a multitude of other reasons why the convoy is not being disrupted/we're not seeing it disrupted.",b331e1d2fa7b4e90a2c2eb0c338c324fdebd4e06,True,False,,,,,0,1646109616,,0,{},hyvhajf,False,t3_t3fpvo,False,True,t1_hyvf569,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/ukraine_megathread_february_28/hyvhajf/,1646109632,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646080816.0,

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; I would love to hear your opinion on what Russia might do now that they are attempting an operation which is likely beyond the capabilities of the force they have assembled.

It looks like their plan is to do a combination of the things you suggested. They are taking a slight strategic pause, regrouping, and putting an end to the use of thunder runs. Imagery seems to indicate that they are moving massive amounts of men, equipment, and supplies into the area northwest of Kyiv, and it seems likely that they're doing the same around Chernihiv and Kharkiv. They also seem to be pulling in whatever additional forces are reasonably available that weren't previously assigned to the invasion. Notably in this regard, Belarus seems like it might commit a brigade or two to the fighting.

We can also expect a shift in tactics. So far, the Russian have largely operated outside of doctrine. They've largely resisted the temptation to employed massed artillery fires, especially in urban areas, and their air force has been notably MIA (partially due to a shortage of PGMs and a desire to minimize collateral damage). As they get desperate though, these concerns are likely to go out the window.

I still think they lack the logistical capacity to maintain a siege of Kyiv for any extended period of time, without first pausing for several weeks to forward stage the supplies for such a siege. That doesn't mean they won't try a short and violent siege though. As much as the Ukrainians have been tested, we still haven't seen how they might respond to something like Kyiv being encircled for 5-7 days, hammered with artillery and airstrikes, and an almost complete absence of news escaping the area. I think that taking that risk would fail and only compound the disaster for Russia, but it's possible that their leadership feels threatened enough that they feel the need to try more desperate measures.

As an aside, I can also say that I feel fairly confident in revising my estimate of Russian losses upwards a great deal from even a day ago. As some of the [OSINT efforts to catalog all the video/photo confirmed Russian losses](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) have started to catch up with the volume of material released over the last couple days, it seems like the Ukrainian figures might not be as greatly exaggerated as I assumed. It really is looking like Russia may have lost as much as a full brigade worth of equipment so far, and it's reasonable to assume they've taken casualties approximately in line with that amount of lost equipment. In fact, when you consider the number of light infantry operations they've conducted (air assaults, air raids, marine landings, sabotage missions, etc.) it seems likely that their casualties are out-of-proportion to the number of vehicles they've lost. When you see that they have confirmed losses of 41+ tanks (roughly an armored battalion), 90+ APCs/IFVs/AFVs (roughly two mechanized infantry battalions), and 100+ more lightly-armored vehicles (another 1-2 battalions of equipment), it's hard to disbelieve that their casualties run any lower than 3000 personnel. Russian forces may well have lost as many personnel in 4 days as the US did over the entire course of the war in Iraq.",616358e2bc9d23835fe43e32deb043284997f52b,True,False,,,,,0,1646109412,,0,{},hyvgwuq,False,t3_t2zf5q,False,True,t1_hyt96jh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2zf5q/how_much_of_ukraines_current_success_do_you_think/hyvgwuq/,1646109424,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646080612.0,

The ground portion of the nuclear triad is either based in hardened silo's or in mobile launch sites. Those hardened silo's need a warhead to hit within a certain distance in order to guarantee enough over-pressure to be destroyed. 

In a first strike scenario, multiple warheads would be assigned to known silos in order to guarantee that a hit would generate enough over-pressure to destroy the silo. By reducing the circular error probable (CEP) through guidance or fuzing improvements, more warheads are available for other targets, essentially increasing the number of weapons in a nuclear arsenal.

2) Ground forces would utilize intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to identify the column's order of march, form a target priority list, and allow man-portable anti-tank systems (NLAW and Javelin) to destroy SAMs utilizing IR targeting systems. Alternatively, precision fires could be used to destroy these.

[],False,,ringthorn1,,,[],,,,text,t2_13iiix,False,True,"So I would have to disagree. I think it's more a matter of the capacity of logistical avenues of delivery, rather than just the stockpile of beans, bullets, and band aids. Add to this the possible buildup of supplies during the operational reset, and I think we need to go deeper than just quantity. The Russian advance on the Kyiv axis through the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) served two purposes. 

1) It was a surprise. Most conventional military thinking templated the thrust from the N taking the city of Korosten.

2) The CEZ provides what is essentially a No Fire Area (NFA) for Ukrainian forces, due to the presence of volatile materiel. This provides an assembly area for Russian forces to mass without fear of air strikes or indirect fires.

Under the Russian assumptions that Ukraine would have fallen by now (see prematurely published article: [https://web.archive.org/web/20220226224717/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226224717/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html)), advancing through the CEZ makes sense. Ukraine's OC North was probably prepared for an advance on Korosten, and the push through the CEZ caught them by surprise.

However, the war is still on. Russia now has to rely on slow, ground based vehicles on highway P-07 to move logistics, until it can reliably screen out far enough to deny Ukrainian SAM effects on resupply by rotary and fixed wing assets to the airports at Hostomel, Borodianka, and Nalyvaikivka. These vehicles will remain prime targets for ambushes and partisan actions until then.

Had the Russians not underestimated the Ukrainian will to fight, and had they taken Korosten, the logistical options would be increased. Road based logistics networks would have been able to utilize routes along the P-28 and P-49, while the major rail hub in the city would have allowed for a direct flow of goods over rail from Mazyr, Belarus (presuming built up areas along P-28 are taken and secured). In the same way, as above, rotary wing assets could assist in the development of Korosten and the surrounding area as a supply depot.

With Korosten secured, Russian forces advancing E along M-07 towards Kyiv could count on resupply along the route, or the railway parallel to it.

So, above I presented a hypothetical what-if scenario, so I would now like to present to you the same principles in action. Let's shift focus to the Crimean axis. Russians have advanced fairly quickly here because of the favorable terrain, and the light composition of forces deployed under OC South (Motorized Brigades). Most importantly though, is the ease of resupply. Unlike their units on the Kyiv axis, the Crimean forces have enjoyed a high op-tempo, which I attribute to utilizing axes of advance parallel to railways. If you were to overlay the following maps:

You would see that the railways complement the Russian advance from Crimea, and the absence of such is a hindrance to forces advancing along the Kyiv axis. The capture of Berdyansk and its associated rail hub, will shorten the logistics chain for an advance on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro since naval assets could bring supplies into the city, alleviating volume and mitigating risk on the railways traveling through Crimea.

So, now that the importance of logistical flow has been illustrated, it's important for our Ukrainian servicemen on the Kyiv axis to canalize Russian resupply along P-07, and disrupt logistics movement along railways in the south. Heck, these railways don't even need someone to shoot a javelin or launch a drone, they just need someone to throw a big enough log on the tracks: [https://twitter.com/KFOX14/status/1334980918256218114?s=20&amp;t=iDqlBnsJ3XSOx1Qg110fQA](https://twitter.com/KFOX14/status/1334980918256218114?s=20&amp;t=iDqlBnsJ3XSOx1Qg110fQA)",9bb4a5e4b3090f7378aadfcd9d1717eededef751,True,False,,,,,0,1646107199,,0,{},hyvcj65,False,t3_t3fpvo,False,True,t1_hyublo5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/ukraine_megathread_february_28/hyvcj65/,1646107213,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646078399.0,

Batteries firm wind.  If you put have a 100MW wind turbine and you put a 20MW x 2hr battery next to it, often times you achieve a capacity factor north of 80%.  In comparison, wind without batteries will rarely see a capacity factor over 20%.  What that means is that w/ a 20% capacity factor, the grid planning will only 'expect' that wind turbine to make an integrated 20MW/hr.

If they are able to negotiate with Putin, they will likely have to give up Crimea and accept independence for the Donbass puppets, at a minimum. I would still call that a victory if the rest of Ukraine remains intact and they continue to be an independent democracy (albeit flawed). Compared to the alternatives of being fully occupied, being a puppet, or losing even more territory, and given the odds they are facing in the long run, I'd call that a win.

Now I do think this invasions represents a serious miscalculation by Putin, and may hold many perils for him, military, economic, political, or otherwise, but I'm still not sure what that will actually translate to. I think regardless of the outcome of the war though, one thing Putin has already accomplished is to unify NATO and the EU in some truly unprecedented ways.",3f60ce5ceae27b5e62fc5f3e2cb93cdd5e38a803,True,False,,,,,0,1646101304,,0,{},hyv03tc,False,t3_t2nbtx,False,True,t3_t2nbtx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nbtx/lets_say_ukraine_wins_a_decisive_victory_whats/hyv03tc/,1646101318,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646072504.0,

The simple fact is that Russia has failed to achieve their day-one objectives, completely and utterly, and have taken massive casualties, much higher than expected. Putin has resorted to bluffing with nukes because he's desperate, but Ukraine is 'begging' for peace? How can you be sure that it isn't Putin 'begging' for peace?

I already did. Your failure to read and understand the context is, whether intentional or not, entirely your own problem. 

&gt;Similarly, I don't see Ukraine fielding SU-30s or SU-35s

Very few of which Russia has deployed in the theatre, and still failed to establish air superiority with after five days, and at least two of which Ukraine has shot down. Again, asymmetric warfare isn't as cut and dry as you're trying to make it out to be. The Taliban didn't even have jets, and yet, there they are, still existing and even in control of Afghanistan after 20 years. 

Putin is shitting himself to the point of feeling the need to bluff with nuclear threats. There's no way he's nuking anyone, especially in or around Ukraine, after he just declared two new states there. He has a precedent to uphold and has invested too much in his bullshit cover story to end up dumping tonnes of fallout right on top of them. The only reason someone threatens the big stick the way he has is when you're losing, and desperate. 

I know a couple of F-35 pilots. Neither of them think that their 'superior technology' is an automatic I-win button, because the reality is, it's not. There are stories all throughout history that even were an amateur military enthusiast familiar with, you'd know that asymmetric warfare is never a guaranteed victory: The Battle of Long Tan; the New Zealand wars where the Maori consistently defeated superior British forces, often with nothing more than spears vs muskets; thousand of examples from feudal China and Japan; and more than a few modern examples, not the least of which is the constant failure of the US military since Korea to secure victory against 'weaker' enemies; 'weaker' powers have won battles and wars on numerous occasions throughout history, ancient and modern. And your failure to properly consider all the context of this current engagement is, once again, your own failure. Ukraine can absolutely win this, not just because they're now getting help, but on their own. Hell, they've held off Russian advances on their own already. But now that they're getting help, winning is far more likely.

As for your claims that Russia's economy is 'better', you're either not paying attention, or you're being intentionally deceptive. Due to sanctions, Russia's central banks have doubled interest rates, and the Rouble is worth less than it ever has been. GDP is *not*, and never has been, the only factor of consideration, but if you were to run the numbers right now, you'll find that it isn't even on par with that of New Zealand. They don't have the economy to sustain a protracted engagement. The Ukraine does. Because size isn't the same thing as stability. The biggest economies in the world all tanked in 2008, with one exception: Australia. It didn't even blink, despite being 'small', it is incredibly stable and not at all volatile. Russia, big economy or not, has always been volatile and invading another country is a good way of tanking it. You clearly forget what happened to the USSR, and why it was that it all fell apart in the first place. The USSR also had a 'big economy', one of the biggest in the world. Do you know why it all fell apart? That question is intended to encourage you to learn something, because right now, you have no idea what you're talking about.",ff9f32df5faa4a855a26f7a60930ad83d5a1e815,True,False,,,,,0,1646100084,,0,{},hyuxfnc,False,t3_t2nbtx,False,True,t1_hyu08p6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nbtx/lets_say_ukraine_wins_a_decisive_victory_whats/hyuxfnc/,1646100102,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646071284.0,

[],False,,Brendissimo,,,[],,,,text,t2_2hb1oq,False,False,"Japan is NOT going to be launching any offensive wars against anyone for the next 50 years, at a minimum. See [Article 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_9_of_the_Japanese_Constitution) of their constitution, the ""pacifist clause,"" which prohibits them from using war as a means to settle disputes between countries. It also limits their armed forces to defensive capabilities only. It's the reason why they maintain huge [helicopter carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-class_multi-purpose_destroyer) but don't launch any VTOL or fixed-wing aircraft from them.

And more important than the legal aspect (which [may change](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/05/06/national/constitution-ldp-suga-covid-19/) in the future), Japan has adopted a long-standing tradition of pacifism in the wake of WW2, in their culture and politics. That is not something which is easily changed. I think Japan would assist South Korea if attacked, and would defend its territory against China, and might even aid Taiwan, but would not wage any kind of war of aggression any time in the next several decades, probably longer. 

As far as anyone else - what neighbor of Russia has both the ability and the motivation to exploit any potential weakness and risk a nuclear war over it? I cannot think of a single one. China potentially has the ability to defeat Russia militarily in the East Asian theatre, but lacks the motivation. China and Russia largely [settled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict) their outstanding territorial disputes in 1969. And Chinese relations with Russia have been warm as of late, to say the least, even though Russia's present aggression has put China in an awkward diplomatic position.

As others have mentioned, Russia emerging from this war weaker militarily and discredited on the international stage could cause nations like Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other CIS members to potentially drift further from them, but that's a big if, since both of those nations are ruled by strongmen who depend on Putin, in no small part, to stay in power.",73b355cac35baf7336154ab25cda400d3339e0fb,True,False,,,,,0,1646096819,,0,{},hyuqfom,False,t3_t2wf8n,False,True,t3_t2wf8n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2wf8n/if_russia_comes_out_of_the_ukraine_situation/hyuqfom/,1646096836,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646068019.0,

We need to be careful to separate what they are capable of doing and what they are prepared to do. There is no doubt that Russia is capable of defeating Ukraine given a long enough conflict. There is also good reason to believe that could overrun everything east of the Dnieper with current forces at hand, but doing so will come at serious cost to them.

Taking Kyiv at this point in any way that doesn't involve reducing it to complete rubble though is likely unachievable with the forces at hand. Russia may choose to take a strategic pause and assemble the resources necessary for such a siege, but doing so would cost them at least a week (probably longer). It isn't just a matter of getting to Kyiv and surrounding it. They need to have the logistical capacity in the area to actually sustain the forces involved in such a siege.

If the Russians wanted to siege and reduce Kyiv with the forces and resources on hand though, they stand a legitimate chance of losing that fight. It would mean engaging entrenched light infantry forces in urban combat, without having first massed sufficient resources for such a siege. The Russian strategy thus far does nothing to indicate that they have prepared for such a battle or that they have the sustainment capacity for it. They might be able to *reach* Kyiv and even to briefly encircle it, but I would be shocked if they are able to maintain that encirclement for more than three days, and I would be even more shocked if they have the capacity to meaningfully reduce the defenses of the city (short of just turning Kyiv into a giant pile of rubble).",2b42f27d4ae8603b093fb3d03d84ec3179ca25a8,True,False,,,,,0,1646093629,,0,{},hyujpnu,False,t3_t2zf5q,False,True,t1_hyu5w6b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2zf5q/how_much_of_ukraines_current_success_do_you_think/hyujpnu/,1646093646,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646064829.0,

I was reading a analysis from January about a Russian invasion and they discussed previous offensives:

&gt;Mechanized attacks are not always as rapid as attackers hope. Two of the quickest movements of armored forces in history—German general Heinz Guderian’s punch through the Ardennes and seizure of Dunkirk in May 1940, and the U.S. and coalition advance from the Kuwait border to Baghdad in 2003—each averaged approximately 20 miles per day. Movement against a determined foe in winter conditions with limited daylight could reduce that rate of advance significantly.
