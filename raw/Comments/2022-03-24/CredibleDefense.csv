I don't disagree.   


&gt;Not to mention that it's not exactly clear how throwing more fresh untrained under-supplied meat in the meatgrinder increases his chances of winning militarily. 

This one is tricky. We don't know the extent to which it's a meatgrinder currently (as I said, I'd be willing to bet much higher casualties were taken in the initial week of the invasion) and to what extent it will be in the future. We also don't know exactly what would constitute ""winning."" Could Putin simply keep the Ukrainian Army pinned and under heavy artillery fire and basically destroy cities until Zelensky capitulates? Possible. Could an operational pause and some sort of partial mobilization perhaps unfuck the current Russian quagmire? Also possible. Could Russia get bogged down in urban combat and chew threw manpower at an alarmingly high rate? Very possible. To what extent are these likely? I'm not so sure. But as I've said all along, we currently have very little knowledge about what Putin would consider a ""winning"" outcome, nor do we have much knowledge of the current status of the Ukrainian Army. 

&gt;IMHO the risk/reward of that move barely makes any sense for Putin. 

This assumes that Putin sees the war much the same way we do. We cannot make this assumption. Again I'd be willing to bet that the information we are seeing on western media and from OSINT is heavily divergent from what Putin actually hears. 

We also do not have much knowledge of the domestic political situation in Russia. The Kremlin remains as impenetrable as always. 

&gt;He would try to pressure or gaslight Zelensky into a peace settlement

Agreed.

I have another theory.  My theory is that, just like when the US was screaming that Putin was 100% lying about conducting ""training exercises"" and was about to invade Ukraine, the US is now just sharing accurate intelligence for the purpose of making it easier for Ukraine to defend against them, to make it harder for Russia to commit a false flag operation to justify their completely evil and murderous plans, and to build a coalition ready to respond the moment Putin lies are exposed as lies.

[],False,,tujuggernaut,,,[],,,,text,t2_kegah,False,False,"From a strategy standpoint, I think this is a sound article.  Almost everyone seems to agree that:

- the current state of battle is stalemate

- time is against the Ukrainians in the immediate-term as the longer this goes on, the longer civilians and cities get shelled pointlessly.

- time is against the Russian on the medium-term scale because the economic sanctions are likely to start hurting very badly, but that effect takes time.  Example: spare parts not available domestically.  

- time is further against the Russians in that just supporting this military operation is draining a lot of resources.  It's hard to say how many KIA and equipment losses, but it's not trivial.  Early indications have shown a lack of logistics.  While that may improve, it's unlikely to be adequate to sustain their forces for a protracted period.

- The initial objective of rapid regime change failed.

- A lot of resources have been committed to this ""operation"" already thus actually making it harder to justify disengagement.

- Putin does not want to lose face / damage Russian military credibility.  

That last point is biggest I think.  If Putin could rewind time to Feb. 1, I have serious doubts he would still launch this, or at least spend a lot of time revising plans and capabilities.  But he can't, so he's got his forces committed in the field.  We have to think what are the next possible outcomes from the current situation:

- Russia stays in static defensive positions, continues shelling.  Advantage (for Russia): puts pressure on Ukrainian leadership to negotiate on less favorable terms because their civilian population is at risk.  Negative:  waiting game, Ukrainians may not capitulate.

- Russia uses more conventional force to try to defeat Ukrainian military elements.  Advantage:  would mean decisive victory.  Disadvantage:  not sure if even possible.  Assuming it could be done, occupation and irregular warfare would be the next steps which are not desirable, assuming the Ukrainian population does not accept surrender.

- Russia uses more conventional force to attack population centers / non-military targets.  Advantage:  puts even more pressure on Ukrainian leadership to accept quick and unfavorable terms.  Disadvantage: continues to hurt Russia on world stage, early loss of information war outside Russia's borders means these tactics are unlikely to go unnoticed like they may have in Chechnya.  Also expends more of Russia's conventional arsenal, would require greatly increased sorties (and subsequent air asset risk) and continues to leave Russian troops in static ""defensive"" positions.

- Russia escalates via bio/chem attack.  True bio is highly unlikely.  The Russian troops do not have the gear in the field to deal with a persistent advanced biological threat like weaponized anthrax.  AFAIK, those troops have not been recently inoculated either.  Bio weapons are much more likely to spread back into Russia.  That leaves chemical agents.  Sarin was the Soviet weapon of choice but we know Novichok agents have existed since the late-80's or early 90's.  These agents, at least in the 20th century, could defeat NATO NBC protection and detection.  Based on the handling of the poisonings in the UK by officials at Porton Down (where the UK developed all of its chemical weapons), recognition and treatment of Noivchok is not only possible, but as we saw again in the Navalny case, very much something that can be medically treated if one knows the procedures.  It's unlikely there are sufficient quantities of Novichok for a mass attack but it doesn't really matter because such an attack will not be aimed at military forces.  Directed against civilians, the Russians would likely start with one target/city as a demonstration to force surrender.  In terms of PR, this will play out much much worse with the global audience, particularly in Asia, and even more particularly in China.  China remembers what Unit 931 did and their leadership will struggle to justify continued ties with Russia after such an action.

- Russia demo/""tactical"" nuke strike.  Advantage:  overwhelming show of escalation, perception of resolve, force surrender.  Very likely to bring parties to the negotiating table.  Since Chernobyl area is  already an exclusion zone, this would offer and area with ""relatively"" few civilians.  Disadvantage:  PR nightmare even in a 'demo' that is relatively benign.  China is strong no-first-strike advocate, rest of world will distance itself.  Detonating anything on the continent is likely to be a big problem for the rest of Europe downwind and almost certain to provoke some kind of kinetic response from the West.

- Decapitation.  Advantage:  Ukraine has been galvanized by charismatic leader.  Killing or capturing Zelenskyy would strike a huge moral blow.  Leadership succession and continued political will to fight are unclear.  Force negotiation/surrender.  Disadvantage:  hasn't worked yet (they are certainly trying), since that's the case, time is against them.

- End operations.  Advantage:  preserves blood and treasure, may bring reversal of some sanctions immediately, others later.  Avoids making things worse for Russia and ordinary Russians.  Disadvantage:  loss of face, huge personal and political failure.  Justification for the end of ""anti-Nazi"" operations might be difficult and the subsequent return of many military personal will inform more of the general populace within Russia that currently can be fed state media.  Firsthand accounts of action in Ukraine will spread and cause political damage, but this is probably inevitable anyway.  Also no tangible gains or security changes in Ukraine, likely to end up in a worse situation regarding ""security"" on that border.

Not really. 

If some fascist dictator took over Mexico and unleashed them on the cartels, the cartels would be corpses within a month.

They don't have any combat experience, but neither do a lot of countries whose militaries are serious and well-trained. They've done something interesting with their air force.

Something like 43% of their aircraft are inexpensive-to-operate training aircraft. They're investing in the personnel and their skills, not their equipment.

Their AFV corps is laughed at by people who don't understand that tanks die in mountains, and Mexico is one of the most mountainous countries on earth. Their entire military is designed to guarantee a capacity to fight and defend Mexico on Mexican territory with their geographical realities and to maintain the personnel they'd need if they had to rapidly acquire, for example, F-16s for air defense. 

The other big thing in their air inventory is choppers, which are quite useful in the thick vegetation of the Mexican south - another sort of area where tracked vehicles are useless.

Americans foolishly don't have a lot of respect for Mexico, but their military is serious, and has the capacity to defend the country quite well, especially if some Cartel got too big for its britches and tried to start a conventional war to take over the country and turn it into a narco-kingdom.

The problem is that thugs and mafiosos who comprise the Russian elite aren't good at managing complex systems.

Basic resource extraction, drugs, minerals, oil, these tend to be less complex operations that thugs can run without hiring nerds to help.

Built with foreign parts on foreign equipment. They only build enough for parades, because if they actually developed that part of their economy, engineers would take over, and then they'd start engineering Russia out of the hands of the thugs currently running the place.

i am no expert, but i dont think Russia can achieve this in time to make a difference.(time will tell) we are 1 month in and the invasion is stalled in many areas and is being beaten back.

not to mention Russia has gambled so poorly on this invasion that its now at odds with a untied and angry Nato/EU. Russia will keep a % of its ""trained and capable"" units in reserve in defensive positions in case of a counter attack.

&gt;before their existing forces in-theater are attritted to the point where they lose the ability to even hold their existing positions.

[Looking here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tmj76q/map_chronology_of_the_russian_forward_line_every/) Russia has lost ground on their main breakthrough towards Kyiv  in the north west.

There are reports of Russian forces encircled north west of Kyiv, but these are not confirmed. Across their entire advance they have been ambushed and counter attacked and are at risk of losing the entire area.

to the east, they have been pushed back recently and are also under constant ambushes on their unsecured long supply lines.

&gt;where is the collapse likely to begin, and what are the likely signs that it may be coming?

look to the map linked, while not 100% accurate it paints a picture of multiple stalled Russian attacks, and limited but successful Ukrainian counter attacks.  I would look to the north west of Kyiv, the Russians eastern advance, and to the south near Mykolaiv, the Ukrainians main goal to the south is Kherson.

&gt;do the Ukrainians have the ability to capitalize? How?

yes they do, while we wont see lightning speed warfare with mechanized units taking large areas of land. we will see a slow infantry driven counter assault pushing the Russians in limited key areas, Mykolaiv and north west of Kyiv. Supported by drones and drone directed artillery.

At this point i dont think they will commit large amounts of Armour to the counter attacks, but at the same time they have captured hundreds if not a thousand Russian vehicles that they are pushing back in to service.

The air-force will not play a big role, beyond target strikes  interception missions.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"I didn't go far enough into why it's a problem that there's no formal or legal way for the President's nuclear decisions to be questioned.

If Biden wakes up tomorrow morning and says ""you know, I'd really like to wipe Eswatini off the map today"", of course the order wouldn't be carried out. It's clearly an absurd decision that has no basis in reality.

No, the problems come in more ambiguous circumstances, where justifications exist, but there's no compelling need to use nuclear weapons. Maybe there's even a senior administration member who advocates using them. ([Curtis LeMay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_LeMay) seemed to think that every problem is best solved by bombing it, for example. He spent the entire Cuban Missile Crisis trying to convince JFK to start World War III. After the crisis was resolved, he advocated attacking Cuba anyways on general principle.)

In a case like that, it's entirely possible that the missiles are launched even though almost everybody thinks they shouldn't be launched, because everybody waited for someone else to take a stand until it was too late.

By the time the order is in military hands, everyone involved is very strongly trained not to question it - that their responsibility is to authenticate the order, and execute it if the order is authentic. In 1973 [the Air Force discharged Maj. Harold Hering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hering), a Minuteman missile crewman, for asking the same question we're considering right now.

&gt; Along with concerns over the possible deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, the Biden administration is now warning that the Russian military may launch a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine. Russia has used chemical weapons during past conflicts, notably in Chechnya and Syria, in violation of international law. Russian officials denied Biden’s accusation during a U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday.

&gt; Matthew Bunn is James R. Schlesinger Professor of the Practice of Energy, National Security, and Foreign Policy at Harvard Kennedy School and co-principal investigator of the Belfer Center’s Project on Managing the Atom. Bunn spoke with the Gazette about Russia’s potential use of chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine and how the Biden administration and the West may respond. Interview has been edited for clarity and length.

This is a short interview with a professor who studies what he is speaking about. Although short and a bit shallow, it is interesting to me to read his up to the moment analysis of where we are right now. 

&gt; BUNN: My bet is less than a 5 percent shot that nuclear weapons will get used in this conflict. I wish I thought it was inconceivable; I no longer think it’s inconceivable. My colleague Francesca Giovannini had a piece quite early in the invasion in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, saying if things get to what she called “a hurting stalemate,” which is exactly where we are right now, where Putin can’t afford to lose, the plausibility of escalating to the use of a nuclear weapon would be noticeably higher.

I think the main distinction between the obvious WW2 comparison and here though is, 

1. Soviets in '41-'45 were fighting a defensive war against extermination, and had far higher morale to make such frankly reckless frontal engagements more fierce. It's hard to convince a conscript invading their brother's nation to do something like this effectively. 

2. Soviets especially by Bagration in '44 had a far more talented Command Staff.

3. Frankly, Soviets had far more of an expendable population and the industry to back up these high-loss battering ram operations.

It just feels like a square peg in the round hole... You can't do Operation Bagration or Operation Kursk without the worldwide leading industrial output and Lend-Lease, the tens of millions of mobilized and fiercely nationalistic men, and the command staff whetted on years of battle.

* If the militants at Fallujah were armed with Javelins and NLAWS, the US tactics in that battle never would have worked. Basically would make even US armor a no go zone.
* The Russians are as bad tactically as they seem. He said they open with a bombardment, attack frontally, get repulsed with heavy casualties, and then try the exact same thing again. Very low coordination, very low tactical sophistication.
* Ukrainian morale is extremely high and, unlike the Russians, they are very good at fighting in mobile groups, which nullifies a lot of the Russian arty. They also routinely sally out at night and hit the Russians in the flanks. 
* Ukrainians have better night optics than the Russians.

However Russians can endure heavy losses and defeats if they see the fight worth fighting.

That's where Putin might have made a fatal mistake. Top military officials I'm Russia probably genuinely believe the west wants to destroy Russia (which is in itself stupid, by top officials are probably all child's of the USSR). That means they're willing to go to great lengths to ensure the survival of Russia is not in jeopardy. The longer this needless conflict goes, the more exposed Russia becomes, as they're losing soldiers and hardware by the day. 

At some point the generals will become more afraid of loosing too many assets and becoming vulnerable at home than they are of Putin. 

Now one could argue that the generals might lack enough political clout for a coup, but I'd argue that the intelligence officers will also eventually come to the same conclusion.

I think rationally -- the war is costly to Ukraine and could spiral out of control. Ukraine is losing people, infrastructure, military assets, and the planting season. Ending it is worth some concessions, but Ukraine needs defensible borders and a way to defend them going forward.

To me that means:

- (1) getting rid of any disputes so they can enter bilateral defense agreements (or NATO, but that's unlikely).
- (2) having borders that clear and easily defensible, I'm not sure Crimea with a Russian navy base will ever be that.

So, inheld areas in Donbass have to go to Ukraine, while island-like Crimea can't be held. Presumably this gives Ukraine defensible borders that Poland, Germany, or other countries can help defend. But:

&gt;But in this case Russia really isn't looking at losing their own sovereignty or territory, though they have convinced themselves to see it this way. So it also becomes a question of what's acceptable to them. 

Yeah, this. But there is going to be political pressure as the Russian economy slows and thousands of conscripts come home dead.

The loss/destruction of the steel factory in Mariupol alone is having big ripple effects internationally already

Trying to think rationally, it depends on how the Ukrainians are feeling and this is going to be a point of national page. 


Off the top of my head... Would Ukraine accept any conditional terms for peace? Or would they be so pissed that even Zelenskyy couldn't make them accept conditions? Would Russia even have the military strength to hold those territories or would Ukraine have sufficient forces to dislodge them? Is there a NATO consensus on what an acceptable end state of the war would be? Would they support a partial, face-saving win for Putin or will they see spanking him down as the necessary solution? Would they support Ukraine if they did try to retake the lost territories, including Crimea? 

Realistically, you only get conditional surrenders or negotiated ends to the war if the other side still has the means to resist and the winner is trying to cut their losses.

But it only works when you consider a currency area. As the EZ uses a shared currency, it doesn't make sense to compare individual EZ members via PPP.

&gt;The IMF, World Bank and CIA all use PPP

Correct, they do. And it's a hard thing to balance. I'm not saying ""don't use PPP"" I'm saying it only works well if you compare currency areas to currency areas. Russia has its own currency, Italy does not.

PPP can't be effectively used in that scenario.

It can *for Russia* but it cannot *for Italy.*

So I'm 100% willing to accept that the Russian figures are accurate, but the Italian ones at PPP? Nobody actually knows.

&gt;According to the IMF (2021), GDP per capita (in current international $) for these countries is:

&gt;Russia: $30,431.21
&gt;Costa Rica: $21,592.49

That's GDP Per Capita at PPP.  And yeah, if you use PPP as opposed to Nominal, Russia moves up a few rungs from 88 to 75. Well done Russia! Massaging the data puts your $30.43K per Capita just behind *Panama's* $30.89K per Capita.

Pedantry over Costa Rica aside, the point stands, Russia has a very weak economy, and all these measurements come before the sanctions.

&gt;I'd say it depends on how things develop in Asia in the coming decades.

You mean China?

They value their significant trade with Europe and the Americas - who are almost all backing Ukraine - far more than they value their relationships with Russia.

They'll string Russia along sure, but they're not going to prop them up without something significant in return.

The only thing China cares about is China. 

And the question which has never been answered is what with the significant potential costs to backing Putin or bailing him out, what does China get?

&gt;Then tensions will last, because even a President Navalny wouldn't accept that.

Correct. Russia has painted itself into a corner here, and walled itself off from economic growth for a few decades at least. No one is interested in solving this situation with an outcome favorable to Russia, nor does Russia have any mechanism to force that.

Russians will either accept their status as a has-been regional power or they can wander in the cold for a few decades.

No one is interested in mutual benefit with Russia anymore.

No problem.

&gt;Okay first off, no it isn't. The Euro outclasses the Ruble in purchasing power by orders of magnitude even before you compare it to the current ruble in free-fall.

The very purpose of PPP, namely Purchasing Power Parity, is to account for the distortions caused by market exchange rates.

&gt;It is therefor not mathematically possible to calculate Italian PPP separate from the Eurozone, and any statistics created to that purpose will be entirely unreliable and can be cooked to show whatever the person creating them wishes to show.

[The IMF, World Bank and CIA all use PPP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)#Table)

&gt;But that doesn't change the fact that we're talking about a country that rivals Costa Rica in terms of GDP per capita.

According to [the IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October) (2021), GDP per capita (in current international $) for these countries is:

1. Russia: $30,431.21
2. Costa Rica: $21,592.49

&gt;And unlike Costa Rica, most of that GDP per Capita is Oil.

Oil and gas were 15% of [Russia's GDP in 2020](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Gas-Share-Of-Russias-GDP-Dropped-To-15-In-2020.html).

&gt;They're not some massive economic threat

Russia is a reasonably large economic power, roughly comparable in size to Japan, Germany, France or the U.K., with a somewhat lower GDP per capita and a somewhat larger population. They account for \~3% of global GDP.

I agree that they're not an economic threat.

&gt;There isn't a scenario where these sanctions get removed and things go back ""to normal.""

It doesn't call for killing Jews. Besides, I've already addressed what I think of their slogan:

1. ""As a matter of personal preference I do, in fact, find it wrong. But I don't expect my personal tastes to matter much in the context of the Yemeni conflict.""

Okay first off, no it isn't. The Euro outclasses the Ruble in purchasing power by orders of magnitude even before you compare it to the current ruble in free-fall.

Second, it's impossible to accurately compare Italy and Russia on a PPP basis because Italy doesn't have its own currency. The only way to use those metrics is to compare Russia with the entire Eurozone, because it's based on comparing currencies and the economies that back them.

It is therefor not mathematically possible to calculate Italian PPP separate from the Eurozone, and any statistics created to that purpose will be entirely unreliable and can be cooked to show whatever the person creating them wishes to show.

So I guess you could compare them to Canada if you wanted to.

But that doesn't change the fact that we're talking about a country that rivals Costa Rica in terms of GDP per capita. 

And unlike Costa Rica, most of that GDP per Capita is *Oil.*

Ukraine agreeing to Russia permanently occupying the entire coast between Crimea and Russia is a stretch.

Zalenskyy has also already floated Ukraine not joining NATO in return for some sort of security guarantee because he understands that NATO is not in any hurry to accept Ukraine anyway.  Zalenskyy did not offer to back away from joining the EU, so it may be a Sweden / Finland scenario shortly after the war with the security guarantee coming from a future EU membership.  I can also see Zalenski agreeing to being in some sort of nuclear weapon free zone similar to what Finland has floated several times for Nordic states as a condition to joining the EU.

https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-nato-b6ebbed656714b5558742f08fc6a96a2

&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was prepared to discuss a commitment that Ukraine would not seek NATO membership in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine’s security.

&gt;“It’s a compromise for everyone: for the West, which doesn’t know what to do with us with regard to NATO, for Ukraine, which wants security guarantees, and for Russia, which doesn’t want further NATO expansion,” Zelenskyy said.

&gt;He also repeated his call for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Unless they meet, it is impossible to understand whether Russia even wants to stop the war, Zelenskyy said.
Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine will be ready to discuss the status of Crimea and the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists after a cease-fire and steps toward providing security guarantees.

This means that if Russia withdraws from all of Ukraine except Crimea, an enlarged Donetsk and Luhansk, secures water and a land route to Crimea and extracts a token agreement that Ukraine will not join a defense alliance that has shown no interest in allowing it to join any time soon, Russia will have fulfilled almost all of their stated goals for starting their ""Special operations"" and Putin can spin it as a success, even though he will not have significantly altered Russia's position in Ukraine at the expense of thousands of war dead and ongoing crippling sanctions because Putin's Russia does not care about thousands of war dead, and Putin and his supporting oligarchs only care about the economic wellbeing of Russians such that masses do not live badly enough to kick them out of power.  If the masses can live better, then Putin and the Oligarchs like it because there is more to skim off the top, but they are going to live well either way.  The funny thing is that Putin went in thinking that the low hanging fruit was that he could do a thunder run for a quick and easy regime change.

Ukraine is not going to run out of soldiers and weapons anytime soon. Russia is.

So as long as they can claim a credible victory, the government may not be undermined from a stalemate/loss. On the other hand, an abject humiliation could jeopardize the government in favor of a counter-elite coup, some kind of political alliance between out-of-favor oligarchs and the military against Putin and the FSB and United Russia.  

From what I've read there's basically three potential scenarios going forward.  From a russian perspective: 

Option 1 - Worst case scenario - complete collapse of the invasion - The Russians either voluntarily withdraw from Ukraine or lose cohesion sufficiently that the Ukrainians can push them out.     

Option 2 - Most likely case - a significant pause and stalemate in the fighting in the short term, while Russia attempts to reinforce and consolidate its territorial gains against UA counterattacks and is at least partially successful. 

Option 2a - Russia finds the resources to build up its forces in Ukraine for a second offensive, perhaps sometime in the summer, and finds a way to avoid long term harm from sanctions. 

Option 2b - Russia and Ukraine use the stalemate to enter into a ceasefire and begin working toward some negotiated settlement.   A beneficial settlement could allow the Russian government to save face even if it hides behind a de-facto loss.  For example if Ukr. were to agree to the independence of Donbas and Luhansk and not joining NATO (stretch goal - a guaranteed land-bridge to Crimea). Russia could claim enough of a victory that Putin might be able to salvage his internal political position. 

Option 3 - least likely - most military analysts are wrong and after a short pause Russia  has or will have the forces to push the invasion into urban areas in the North and be successful.",8f041a92651b6b7262c980fe964bec4d7b4ca14a,True,False,,,,,0,1648133302,,0,{},i1xqb93,False,t3_tm3o0j,False,True,t1_i1xnwce,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tm3o0j/ukraine_megathread_march_24/i1xqb93/,1648133318,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648104502.0

If Russia succeeds in simply getting Ukraine to agree to not join NATO and going back to a contested Donbas and Crimea while ruining their economy - is that really victory? Because that's looking like the most likely outcome.

Let's say they get Ukraine to not join NATO, get to keep Crimea, and pull support for the ""independent"" Donbas states (essentially giving them back to Ukraine) while destroying the economy - is *that* victory?

The army is kept politically and socially weak by the security state to prevent it becoming a pole of power. Consider how many coups and dictatorships come from the military. But how few tend to come from security services. 

The ex KGB in the early 90s were often lowly to not paid so found new ways to earn money. Often by selling their services too or becoming mafia and politicians and businessmen. The three became different parts of the same network. Putin's takeover of the country was an intelligence service soft coup. Parts of the mafia and business elite were fully behind it. Because it was all parts of the same network. 

There will be a purge. But it will not be about corruption. It will be about power and settling scores. Those who have shown disloyalty will have their corruption exposed. This is how these kind of criminal orginisations work, everyone has to be dirty, all have to be in it together and anyone can be exposed as corrupt when they fall out of favour. 

&gt;While this will not fix morale issues, it is undoubtedly a good thing and may fix systemic issues associated with the logistical side of warfare, which has obviously been a big problem in this war.

This is not a war. This is not a military operation gone bad. These are not properly maneuvering mechanised units seeking to exploit space and envelop enemies to bring them to their destruction. This was an FSB coup aiming to replace the current government with a Russophilic one that would pander to Moscow. The military were not operating as combined arms, they were cueing to over run targets occupied by the VVD, crush some small scale Ukrainian army opposition and allow the Rosgvardia OMON (riot police) to crow control any dissent. Lead elements had bloody riot shields. 

This is an FSB security state, run by corrupt ex KGB turned politician Mafioso. 

Perhaps some will be punished for being too greedy. 

Perhaps the sheer risk to the regime will see the army given real command to run an army operation. 

But in my view, from what experts have described Russia to me, corruption is not a bug, its the purpose of the system.",2595173f4c17c10b2b1c10c4168098ea9a57aa25,True,False,,,,,0,1648130623,,0,{},i1xjs17,False,t3_tm3o0j,False,True,t1_i1xgigw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tm3o0j/ukraine_megathread_march_24/i1xjs17/,1648130634,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648101823.0

MAD only applied to strategic nuclear weapons. Both sides had plans for tactical nuclear weapons. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven\_Days\_to\_the\_River\_Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_to_the_River_Rhine)

The Soviet war plans had them being used practically at the initiation of hostilities. One of the reasons IRBMs were banned as they were used for mid level nuclear strikes, so called Theatre Nuclear Weapons. A step up above tactical uses. 

One of the problems we have is the asymmetry of conventional power. The west built a huge stock of precision guided weapons that actually took over many of the tasks of tactical nuclear weapons. This like taking out entire air force bases and their runways or major junctions. So we could be still on our conventional scale when we trip Russia into what it sees as needing tactical nuclear responses. 

Back in the 70s and 80s it was an almost unwritten gospel that as one started to lose in a big way there would be a tactical nuclear response to force a pause and have everything really really sure they wanted what came next. 

Not helped by the paranoid old men in Moscow and the sudden surge of gung ho in Washington in the early 80s.",f2091fd3dbc68167ed8f3bb4e94eee6374f375be,True,False,,,,,0,1648129795,,0,{},i1xhuky,False,t3_tm3o0j,False,True,t1_i1xfv3x,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tm3o0j/ukraine_megathread_march_24/i1xhuky/,1648129814,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648100995.0

If I get this right, Legionaries can be ordered around like a regular soldier, so I guess it allows more flexibility to the officers in charge, if you need them to do a different job you just give a different order. While with mercenaries you probably have a contract that needs to be renegotiated whenever the mission changes.

Also, I don't know enough to know exactly why, but multiple chains of command (or people/groups outside of the chain) seem to be a very very big practical problem (that is why one of the first things NATO did was ""unify"" the chain of command of the member countries).

The significance is hard to say without knowing Russian logistics, so what follows is a guess.

It seems that in order to alleviate their supply situation in the south, Russia is shipping equipment straight to Berdyans'k rather than to Sevastopol. This massively shortens their supply lines to Mariupol as well as the eastern fronts around Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk. 

Obviously equipment and ammunition that may have been destined for these fronts will be missed, but are not game changing. What will be more important is how comfortable Russia will be in continuing to use Berdyans'k. Not using it will mean that they will have long supply lines stretching from Crimea, but continuing to use it runs the risk of future losses from strikes. I expect that they will continue to use it, but will beef up the AA defences heavily, leaving frontline units elsewhere more vulnerable to attack.

So consider those numbers for a minute including Crew and assuming its fully loaded thats  potentially (and pardon the pun) a Boatload of KIA's or WIA's along with literally tons of equipment going up in flames.

Its also fairly impressive considering Ukraine lacks a lot of powerful Anti Naval defenses  like ASM's LLASM's or other modern costal defenses.

That sounds like it would apply a week ago, but not so much today. Russian forces have been pushed back out of artillery range all around Kyiv and it's clear those forces can barely hold their positions, let alone take ground back. In the South things have changed in a similar fashion, with ukranians close to retaking Khersin now, which will have a huge psychological effect on Russian troops. To make it worst, a few hours ago, Russian ships where attacked at port I'm Berdyansk, deep inside Russian controlled territory. 

Based on recent events, I'd speculate a likely outcome is that in the next month or so all Russian troops west of the Dniper will either retreat or surrender, while in the south the ukranians will consolidate their gains and possibly retake Kerson (depending on how well defend it is).

For sure. But we can hope, if we wanna go there even with them, not too many will see the end of the war. 

&gt; Russians and Ukrainians will lose a lot in this war, the fact is that Ukraine will suffer more.

So true. That's what makes it so hard to imagine what could realisticly end the war via negotiation. IF they find some sort of peace-agreement it seems guaranteed to lead to a simering conflict ready to erupt again with the hatred this must have caused in Ukraine (probably not low to begin with). 

Maybe the best shot would be if Putin actually is removed. Some old comerades being interned or leaving may be early indicators of regime-collapse. Nothing solid and the reports on how Putin has isolated himself make it seem like he's probably taking every precaution not to meet somebody with a dagger in their cloak. But it does seem like a possibility that he's made such a catastrophic mistake with this war that it costs him his reign or even his head.

New leadership that can actually go back to pre-war status and blame it all on Putin seems like the best-case at this point.

Then this leaves Ukraine in the position of making a concession that for the Ukrainian people would be...well, rather hard for them to swallow.

Russians do not have to hear a peep about war crimes, more or less, and when they hear anything bad happening, all evidence is that they immediately go into denial.

How many Ukrainians are aware of at least one war crime now, if they haven't already seen the results of the war themselves? Quite a lot.

Simple Lanchestrianism says that if the threat can be brought to battle, you can indeed apply this kind of bullets per meter of front prediction, just like you can predict the rates at which two sheets of sandpaper will rub each other smooth by knowing the grit density and linear friction axes across a known deposition area.

The Salvo model says you're going to use a cookie cutter to not just wipe out all grit in a given area but cut out a chunk of the paper through which you can attack the other side of the paper until eventually there is not enough backing to keep from crumpling the front as the inadequate ability to sustain continuous application of combat power.

Putin should have been the cookie cutter.  Because he was the one on the offense and had a MASSIVE superiority of fires.

Why follow the German model of Barbarossa in thinning his forces by attacking across so many axes?

Why not choose a point of assault where he could employ a pair of divisions with one acting as a buffer to the other's more rapid advance?

Why seize cities but not THE Capital, given that Smolensk, Bryansk and Vyazma was how the Russians began to Breyr Rabbit the Heer into the Bryar Patch of a 'war of annihilation' operational bog down as loss of campaign season time?

Why, if he's KGB, and he's had two decades of fighting corruption in the system, didn't Putin have his FSB people check every number, in every warehouse and fuel depot with names-on-a-list 'Sign here, you're dead if you're lying...' certification?  Why are front line troops running around without bodyarmor?  KGB and SV have \_never\_ gotten along.  Ever.  Why base heads-will-roll failure in false trust now?

Where is the VKS?  Where are the Kh-31s/Kh-58s/Kh-59s taking radar, radio and television off the air?  One of the first targets of the Georgian war was the television station.  No media = no mass audience assigning favor to the victims.  No Churchillian leader spouting 'we shall fight them on the beaches and in the hills!' BS as a rising sense of rudderless = hopeless surety of defeat.

Politically, you never want your enemy to have a say in the progress of battle and while that's certainly true from the perspective of The West denying all opportunity for the other side to give an alternative to the propaganda; it should equally have been true for the Russians, within the Ukrainian theater itself.  If nothing else, every western media team should have been captured or killed, Day-1 of the war, with Spetz teams.  

Let the entire theater be a media coverage black hole. 

If Putin knocks out the air defenses, he should then be able to establish air dominance over 30+30 Su-27/MiG-29 fairly simply because -his- SAMs still work and his 150+90 Su-30/35 are that much technologically better.

At which point, it's just a matter of a few days before bridges which bring NATO weapons into play are taken out, the utilities/food distribution in each city are taken out and the Ukrainian population begins to starve, enmasse.

The Russians have supposedly fired 650 missiles.  Against what targets?  It certainly hasn't been the correct ones.

With air defenses down, and strategic infrastructure in ruins, now you can switch to CAS and, even bombing from over 20,000ft to avoid Stingers, attack coordinates JTAC/FIST radio'd to the SVP-24 bombing system, now installed on most Tu-22, Su-24 and Su-34 aircraft.

Trouble from the treeline Lassie?  Wuf-wuf!  Well here's some FAB-500s.

Between the CAS, the SPH artillery in-column, the 1,000+ tubes of Grad, Smerch and other MRL just over the border and the divisional flank security screens, this nonsense with letting Javelin/NLAW ambush teams get close doesn't happen because it's only 50km from the border to Chernihiv and 150km from Chernihiv to Kyiv.

That's something which can be driven on a single fueling with a T-90 tank, at an average of 20mph.

If need be (truly horrendous resistance), you burn every village, forest and cross roads to the ground along your route of march with TOS-1 salvos to make sure there is no point of cover as urban settlement to hide partisan forces in.  Preemptively.

Let's throw in roving Spetz teams in SR roadwatch on any transverse routes, so these militia forces have no stealthy approach lanes to whatever MSR you are tied to because of your wheeled logistics.

If nothing else, as soon as he started to meet serious, sustained, pushback; Putin should have begun considering a nuclear strike on Kyiv to simply 'take away the focal point' rather than seize it.  Now, there's no more political control.  No destination address to Fedex more Javelins or NLAW to.

No more tactical interference at the frontal level by The West.

And what is NATO going to do?  Thanks to the idiocy of INF, their only equivalent counter \_defending a Non-NATO Partner\_, is air delivered B61-11/12.  Which may not even be penetrable against SA-20/21.  Because the only units with F-35 in theater are NATO partners and I doubt if they would want that responsibility.

Assuming they are aiming at field dispersed military forces rather than say Moscow.  

Because Putin \_makes the call\_ that tells whoever is in charge while Biden naps that the first nuke on Russia soil is going to result in his dropping 30X SS-27 X6 MIRV onto the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.

Not NATO.  You don't threaten the dog.  You threaten the owner.  
Putin should have won this fight, no more than two weeks into it.  Simply by making his frontal advance too dense to even reach his logistics and making his retaliatory measures non-linear in their massive escalation until he eventually eliminated Zelensky as his political base, entirely.

By capture or by leveling the city.

And given he has been warning, on every public television interview, televised conference and staged press meeting that 'We know what you're doing and we're not happy about it, so you had better stop, NOW.  Because I'm running out of ways to let you know this is unacceptable...' for literally a decade and a half, you would think Putin would have been prepping his 'Or Else' for at least that long.

This is not a decade's planned operation.  This is amateur hour nonsense.

Which is as much a political failure as an operational one because when you let the dog off the leash, it's too late for more than minor course corrections as deploy-this-asset signatures on the development and pacing of the combat arms side of things.

Post line of departure, The Army Is In Charge.

Pre-assembly of forces at the border, Putin is.  Therefore, the primary political consideration should be \_Who Is Zhukov\_ and which Konev, Rokossovsky, Kirponov, Vatutin, Rudenko and Rotmistrov does he pick to make his deputies?

These are people choices.  These are things which KGB can put together a folder on and vet for actual achievements rather than political reliability.  These are things which even a militarily ignorant politician can make intuitive value judgments on, via in-person or recorded interviews.

[],False,,BigBlueButtonMan2,,,[],,,,text,t2_fvf8jh6z,False,False,"**First point:**

Very low. This is a very bad decision, that will have no positive benefits for Russia. 

On the other hand, we really don't know who Putin is after this mess, because the decision to invade was so bonkers stupid, possibly entirely emotional. Even before Russia dumped the VDV into the ocean, it was always considered a bad move. 

At that point, if he decides to launch a tactical nuke to try and get the upper hand in the war, it's dependent on exactly how many cogs in the machine want to play along. I'd hope it'd be none that would want to go through with it, but I just don't know for sure. Certainly, others in the past have had the choice and chosen no, so that offers some hope that even if the order started going through the ranks, that the order would be refused.

If Putin believed that invading Ukraine would make Russia safer from the West, then at this point he should recognize that pulling out the nuke button would make Russia even less safe, because you've brought the metaphorical genie out of the bottle and there's no one to blame but yourself. Most certainly, NATO will have no problem staging nuclear weapons in bordering countries. Does that make Russia safer?

I don't think so. But again...we don't know exactly what's going through Putin's head anymore.

**Second point:**

I don't know because of my earlier point about Putin's head.

**The first possibility** is that he wants to get into a better position to negotiate. The maneuvering of artillery into positions for a siege on Kyiv could well be that plan; ""Capitulate on these demands or face the siege.""

At that point, it's dependent on the pliability of both parties. 

Russia demanding that Ukraine ""Denazify"" itself, that it reduce its military, recognize the ""breakaway regions,"" and not join NATO, along with 1 or 2 other demands that Putin made at around a week into the war.  

Ukraine will not ""demilitarize,"" especially after this fiasco. I can see it agreeing not to join NATO, because NATO doesn't want Ukraine, and Ukraine seems like it's okay with not being a part of NATO, as long as it effectively can get the ""perks"" of it (all sorts of support to make Russia think twice about invading again; especially since you can bet your ass Ukraine would come out of this determined to make its military de-facto unbeatable for any future Russian attacks).

Ukraine is most definitely pursuing EU membership though.

On Ukraine's end, this is dependent on how much Ukraine wants at the negotiating table, and what they are willing to concede. Ukraine very much wants Crimea and the Donbass back. How much they push this will complicate the pliability of Russia.

If they are willing to accept the Pre-February-24th lines of territory, they are in a very good negotiating position. They can offer to go after the Azov Battalion and similar elements. Get rid of them (ideally, offer that they quit their nonsense or find themselves under the pursuit of Ukrainian authorities). A largely symbolic gesture, but a good move because of it. They lose nothing from getting rid of Azov. Putin can get a PR victory at home. Ukraine can offer to let the two ""breakaway republics"" have an actual vote on what they want.

The result of this would satisfy the initial declaration of independent republics by Russia before the invasion, on the 21st, and would also probably result in Ukraine getting these breakaway regions, assuming it is an entirely fair and free vote.

The alternative is more of this stupid war.

**The second possibility** is that Putin is full-stakes. He doesn't want to genuinely negotiate. He just wants Ukraine. He can try and negotiate to ""buy time,"" but I don't see a distinct advantage to this, because all while Russia is sanctioned, Ukraine will be buying time to further prepare themselves with the assistance of the US and NATO. With the performance of the Russian military, even if they fixed whatever they could within some set time frame, a potentially even more prepared Ukraine could offset any advantages that brings for winning the conventional campaign. 

But even if Russia does win the conventional campaign, it will bloody and awful. He then has to deal with the insurgency. He cannot win an insurgency, in the sense of coming out in a stronger position than he went in. The more brutal Russia is in Ukraine, the more sanctioned they will become. This will occur over years, allowing the EU to transition away from Russian energy dependence smoothly...arguably, which they could already be in the process of starting. 

At that point, Russia will only have China. This is not a mutual relationship, even from the perspective of realpolitik. Russia might be bigger on a map, but it is economically more pathetic than Italy, while China is the second largest economy in the world.

Ultimately, I don't know what Putin's endgame is.

[],False,,DiligentInterview,,,[],,,,text,t2_1wdvg1lg,False,False,"**I wonder, what their plan is for their Foreign Legion in the long haul.** 

I think there is a lot of good points in the article. I think that there is a lot of room and space for ""untrained"" personnel. The problem with that statement, is **I am looking at it from a Long war perspective**. Their plan IIRC is for 120,000 personnel in their foreign legion, which gives you 4 divisions with corps and army troops. 

I would guestimate it would take 6-12 months to really establish, supply, equip and train that many troops. I also would look at their employment in a limited perspective. 

If they go that way, I think there is more flexibility than troops running over to ""Get some"", rather a deliberate plan, and a move to try and build a cadre around experienced former NCOs and Officers, to start cadre battalions, training. I estimate, in a wartime, throwing the baby out with the bath water, it should take no more than 2 months (40 Training days)  to train someone to a ""basic infantryman"" standard, especially when talking of dismounted infantry. (I've gamed out a potential training syllabus). 

At 1 instructor per 10., you would need around 2000 instructors for the entire force, with about 1000 more support staff.  Again, this would train them to the section level, as well as individual skills. You even could do a system similar to how the US mobilized in WW2, where basic training was done at the unit level. 

If they did determine an Orbat (I've played around with a long war idea for this based around 3 divisions with 2 brigades, 2 reserve brigades and corps/army troops and headquarters),

Each brigade eventually consisting of: (Depending on trained personnel and most importantly, equipment)  
Brigade HQ+ Signals  
Intelligence Company (ASIC mostly as well as intelligence platoons to Infantry Battalions.)  
Defense and Security Company  
Brigade Anti Armour Battery (TOW/NLAW/Javelin/MILAN/SPG-9)  
Brigade Light Air Defense Battery  
Light Field Regiment (Mortars or towed artillery)  
Infantry battalion (Dismounted Infantry) (Without Support company)  
Infantry Battalion (Dismounted Infantry) (Without Support company)  
Infantry Battalion (Partially Motorized as Brigade Reserve, use busses for all it matters.)  
MP Company  
Recce Regiment (SUV/4x4/Land Rover + Dismounted)  
Ordinance Company  
Field Ambulance  
Engineer Regiment (Both combat engineers, construction engineers and pioneers/labourers to build defensive works, as well as lighting, plant and where possible survey troops)  


Divisions would not be a full division HQ, more an overlay to cover sectors, with a Signals Element, MP element, and Defense and Security force. This would also allow for liaison with the civil government. 

Corps / Army troops would be the standard Corps and Army Support, equipped as available comprising western experts, as well as a general headquarters and training establishment.

 as well as a long term force workup. (I would say 2-6 months from now, being able to start collective training), you could employ them in LOC and in quieter sectors of the front. (I would actually keep the entire corps near Lviv in order to provide additional security to the land bridge to Poland as well as to act as an emergency reserve incase of offensive breakthrough.)

At the 6 month point, full training establishments should be set up, able to process several hundred recruits a month. The advantage is that you can also begin to build higher levels of command early on, by plucking individuals who have experience.

At that point as well, start moving brigades into quieter sectors for example the Transnistria (sp?) border, or the Belarus border to cover those places, and free up Ukrainian troops and reservists for offensive operations. This also gives you a good 6 months collective training process for higher staff, as well as the ability to better equip the force. 

There's no glory in it. It would be a mostly static force, as well as most likely bottom of the totem pole for equipment.  Keeping it completely separate below Corps/Army level also allows for a uniform language to eventually come out. (Most likely English lets be honest).",4925749c28270b1a316569a13cddf2966f4cb424,True,False,,,,,0,1648108223,,0,{},i1wlbns,False,t3_tlwb05,False,True,t3_tlwb05,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tlwb05/lessons_from_finland_for_ukraine_and_its_foreign/i1wlbns/,1648108239,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648079423.0

While the US had sold Pakistan Sabres/Super Sabres for example, by 1965, it was no longer selling the most advanced equipment, and during the 1965 war, it suspended arms shipments to Pakistan [and to India, though India actually bought UK and was impacted thereby.]

In 1971, Nixon connived at getting around his own congress to try and get Pakistan arms from other US client states (Jordan etc). By then SEATO/CENTO was pretty much dead, but Nixon wanted pakistan as a back door to Communist China (backup plan) and had his own racist/personal dislikes as well.

Chechnya and Donbass both illustrated the Russian propensity to rely on artillery. Notice that in Chechnya their problems lasted for half a decade or more.

Here's a description of the results from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chechen_War#Storming_of_Grozny):

&gt;When the Russians besieged the Chechen capital, thousands of civilians died from a week-long series of air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden. The initial assault on New Year's Eve 1994 **ended in a major Russian defeat,** resulting in heavy casualties and **at first nearly a complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces.** The disaster claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained and disoriented conscripts; the heaviest losses were inflicted on the **131st 'Maikop' Motor Rifle Brigade, which was completely destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station.**

A whole lot of shells fired for a whole lot of nothing. 

And in Donbass it caused a lot of death for no meaningful gains on the Russian end of things.

Artillery's good at what it does...

...If you use it right.

America had [the best artillery in WW2.](https://armyhistory.org/u-s-and-german-field-artillery-in-world-war-ii-a-comparison/) (Very good read BTW).

The fundamental structure of artillery being linked to individual units in the speediest, most efficient, most on-call way, giving you exactly what you need when you need it is a mode of artillery usage that is *still* used by the US to this day, **because it works.**

&gt; The maritime environment in East Asia contains both promise and peril. The Indo-Pacific region is host to some of the world’s most important shipping lanes, facilitates huge volumes of regional trade, and boasts abundant natural resources. Competing territorial claims, incidents between neighboring countries, and increasing militarization, however, raise the possibility that an isolated event at sea could become a geopolitical catastrophe. This is all occurring against a backdrop of relative opaqueness. Geography makes it difficult to monitor events as they occur, and there is no public, reliable authority for information on maritime developments.

&gt; The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative seeks to change this. AMTI was conceived of and designed by CSIS. It is an interactive, regularly-updated source for information, analysis, and policy exchange on maritime security issues in Asia. AMTI aims to promote transparency in the Indo-Pacific to dissuade assertive behavior and conflict and generate opportunities for cooperation and confidence building. Because AMTI aims to provide an objective platform for exchange, AMTI and CSIS take no position on territorial or maritime claims. For consistency, all geographic locations are identified using the naming conventions of the United States Government as determined by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

The amount of open source intelligence that is freely available today is incredible. The satellite images are frequently shared and cited in reference to defense issues. But not all of the OSINT sources also do credible analysis. But this project from CSIS is doing its part to monitor Asia so that the world can see what is happening in real time.

Not just for fighting Ukraine, but really in anything.

In fairness, Russia's entire invasion of Ukraine is asinine. They're invading a country of \~37 million (figure excludes Crimea/DPR and LPR) with 190,000 men, including irregulars. That's a ratio of 195 inhabitants per soldier.

Compare to Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939: 1.6 million troops invaded a country of \~35 million, a ratio of 22-to-1.

Even Mussolini's invasion of Greece in 1940 had better odds: 87,000 men for a country of \~7 million, i.e. 80-to-1. And Italy's invasion of Greece was a clusterfuck.

I honestly wouldn't be too surprised (horrified, but not surprised) if Putin nuked Kyiv and then called it a false flag by NATO to have an excuse to enter the war.

1. Most of Russia's population would believe him, because after all, Russians and Ukrainians are brothers and this ""military operation"" is to help them.

2. It would eliminate Zelensky and most of the Ukrainian government, making it more likely for Ukraine to surrender.

3. It would justify a full-scale mobilization of Russia for the war, in the anticipation of war with NATO.

And why would he take such an extreme action?

1. Russia is losing, and will continue to lose without a total mobilization of Russia toward the war effort... including the implementation of a draft and use of conscripts that he already promised wouldn't happen.

2. The strategy would suit Putin's ""if it looks like you're losing, gamble harder"" strategy.

3. If NATO became involved after the nuclear attack, he could blame NATO for Russia losing the ensuing war (when it inevitably does) rather than taking the blame himself for losing a war against just Ukraine.",9490af8595f61e0e449bb651ccddc3c65891b353,True,False,,,,,0,1648092944,,0,{},i1vzioc,False,t3_tko843,False,True,t1_i1tgzzy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tko843/purchasing_from_a_pariah_indias_armsacquisition/i1vzioc/,1648092955,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648064144.0

Who knows? You certainly don't know they won't exist. Shit, Yeltsin wanted Russia to join NATO. What does post-Putin Russia look like in regards to Ukraine? 

&gt;What ""faith in NATO""? NATO never promised to defend non-member Ukraine and to the contrary, promised the exact opposite that it would *not* send troops, jets, etc. to defend Ukraine.

Carving up Russian border states in a new Partition plan isn't a particularly good look. Once you cede that Russia can dictate which states can or can't be in NATO, you go back on a fundamental tenet of NATO since the fall of the USSR - only prospective members and NATO members determine their membership. In a decade where it was seriously called to question whether Article 5 would hold up, it's not the best look.

&gt;The last one is probably a bit much, but the point is, Russia has to give something up for that piece of paper. If they said they weren't going to give anything up, okay, we tried it my way. It didn't work. You were right, and I was wrong; now let's do it your way. But once again. **WE. NEVER. TRIED. THAT.**

&gt;Remember, we can always do it your way if my way doesn't work. But if we do it your way first, then we can't do my way. That door becomes permanently closed.

Absolutely none of that would fly, and trying would have sent shaky signals to Russia and other members. I mean, as long as we're just throwing imaginative stuff out there, why not throw in full Russian demilitarization?

Besides, that's a conversation for Ukraine and Russia, not Ukraine and NATO. If they want to make that deal (and I'm willing to bet they offered), then that's their decision. 

Russia is risking regime change to secure seperatist regions right now. They wouldn't give them up for formal guarantees on NATO.

The simplest solution thus would be the method some stuff uses now and what that F-15 ASAT I mentioned before does: (bring payload to stratosphere or higher then release its payload and let the payload do the rest of the acceleration where it has less forces to deal with.)  


The problem you get with aircraft assisted deployment is dependent on the aircraft your payload size gets decreased or increased.

The problem with interception weapons is that they need to fly on an interception path with their target not just reach the same relative or exact altitude. Since the object in question is already orbiting quite quickly (relatively) speaking and at a very high orbit altitude. the missile would have to First break atmosphere then course correct on an interception path with the target.  so your looking at essentially a two stage rocket.:  
**First Stage:** escape atmosphere (either with the assistance of a plane or completely self powered.  
**Second Stage:** Aim at target and course correct for an interception.   


So for LEO targets it should be fairly easy but for MEO or GEO targets it becomes a slight bit more complicated.

It's not.

WP is ostensibly a obscurant munition with an *incidental* incendiary effect. I stress the *incidental* part, because that's how military lawyers have argued. It is not a purposeful incendiary weapon. 

the Kyiv Independent said [The use of such weapons against civilians is banned by the Geneva Conventions.](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1506618035729276941) Well, the use of bayonets against civilians are banned by the Geneva Convention. Specifically with regards to the laws of war, it is specifically forbidden to use incendiary weapons in areas with concentrated civilian habitation even when the use of other kinds weapons make military sense. Laws of War sometimes make the exception that while deliberately targeting civilians are illegal, if your opponent is firing from civilian homes or buildings, and shooting back makes sense militarily, it is not illegal to shoot back. The conventions make an exception that if you have to shoot back at civilian buildings it is still illegal to use incendiary weapons. However, ostensibly, White Phosphorus is an obscurant munition with an incidental incendiary effect.

The primary purpose of WP use on enemy infantry, at least according to doctrines, is for damage to optical sensors and the likes. Burns, toxic effects, and deaths are just fringe benefits.

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,False,"&gt;Actually, Moscow has been crystal clear with its demands from day one:

Again, I don't really buy the assertion here. I will lay out the reasons. 

&gt;1. Neutrality of Ukraine (no NATO membership)

This was probably the clearest war aim Russia had, but they went about it in a very confusing way. The mostly placed this demand at the feet of NATO, whereas the country making that decision would be Ukraine.

Overall, I think this relates back to the speech Putin gave when announcing the SMO. On one hand Putin has demands of the Ukranian state. On the other hand, he has trouble negotiating with Ukraine in a sovreign capacity, because he also questions the state's right to exist. 

Additionally, NATO membership for Ukraine was not imminent and unlikely to happen. Russia's demands were clear in the sense that a hostage takers demands may be clear. Why the demands should lead to instant and full-scale war were far less clear. 

Combined with other Russian demands regarding the greater ""Russian World,"" the misdirected NATO demands were interpreted as a threat, not a negotiating position.

&gt;2. Demilitarisation (no weapons that can threaten Russia)

A very strange demand considering that there were not, and still are not, any weapons in Ukraine that would threaten Russia. This one is another head scratcher for Ukraine.

A lot of the ambiguity in this demand turns on what Russia considers to be ""a threat ro Russia."" The fact that you have to clarify what ""demilitarisation"" even means proves the point. That wasn't a clarification Kyiv received prior to the invasion (again, because Putin refused diplomatic efforts, in large part it seems because he does not want to recognize Ukrianian sovereignty).

Moreover, demands for ""demilitarisation"" have often read as a threat to roll tanks into Kyiv whenever Moscow deems necessary when coupled with the lack of a security guatentee. To the extent this point was even clear to Kyiv, I'd argue it's similar to the Austrian letter to Setvia in 1914: a demand tailored to be impossible and lead to war.

&gt;3. Recognition of independence of Donetsk and Lugansk. Recognition of the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Again, a simple enough demand. But then Moacow sent conflicting signals.

First, invading on multiple fronts confuses this. If this war is over the proxy regions, why has Russia invaded all of Ukraine? Many expects belived Putin would disfavor a full-scale invasion and simply send the Russian military to push the line of contact. Trying to sieze Kyiv sends a different message. 

Furthermore, efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the Ukranian government suggest against this, because Russia would not want to undermine a goverment they want recognition from.  Yet they encouraged the Ukranian military to depose Zelenskyy early on. What good is recognition if the goverment doing the recognizing is illegitimate?

&gt;4. ""Denazification"" of Ukraine (later clarified to mean the equal status of the Russian language and banning pro-Nazi parties).

I struggle to even entertain this point. The fact that is even ""later clarified"" points to a catastrophic failure to communicate. 

Either something got horribly lost in translation, or you're being disingenuous, because the easiest way to say ""rights for Russian speakers"" is ""rights for pro-Russian speakers.""

To take this as best intentions, the Russians demanding ""de-nazification"" as a demand were using the word in a context so specific to Russian ideology that nobody else understood what it meant. By in large, I think ""denazification"" is the most non-demand demand of the war. Nobody is quite sure what it means or how to address Russian concerns. A demand that opaque is not of any use.

&gt;This is what they demanded on day 1 and this is what they demand now.

This list of demands is drawn from a negotiating session that happened a few weeks into the war. I'd like to see evidence that this is what Russia demanded on day one.

One of the leading problems with the Russian SMO, again, is the lack of clarity. Their demands leading up to the event were confused, varied, and strange. They made demands of parties that could not comply with. They made demands on a country they also refused to engage with diplomatically. They did this despite rejecting several offers at mediation while building up a military force. 

To be honest, I'd liken this to the Bush Admin's campaign to frame Iraq for WMDs.

Since 2014 the US and UK, and I think also the French, have had folks on the ground in Ukraine redesigning their defenses.  Not generally.  Not just building a generalized national defense...but instead building a Russia specific defense with layered air defenses, and training the Ukraine Army on ""stick and move"" convoy disruption ambush techniques.

In other words, they adopted Russia's doctrine on air defense, and added guerilla style tactics for defense against armor.  

Russia's entire ground strategy is armor and artillery, with some helicopter support.  That sounds generic, but it's not.  Russia doesn't focus on infantry the way the West does.  They're relying FAR more on artillery, and are deploying less infantry with their armor.  The end result of this strategy against the Ukranian defenses is choppers falling from the sky, zero air superiority, armor being ambushed and killed, artillery batteries finding unexpected counterfire (US satellite intelligence is big here), and ultimately unprepared, mostly conscripted infantry left standing in the breach.  This is a generalization, but not far off in the main.  Add the logistics problems into this (another plan developed by our folks...attack supply lines HARD), and mix in the incredible bravery of the Ukranian Army, and this is a nightmare scenario for Russia.

Russia may gain some form of ""victory"" through sheer numbers, eventually, but it's highly unlikely they will gain much more than they already have.  They're being sucked dry through sanctions, and their pleas to China and for mercenaries are laughable.

Please define ""issues"". From what I have seen most people are talking about nuclear weapons not detonating at all due to poor maintenance which I believe to be an absurd suggestion.

There can be a few more failures to launch than mere chance allows for. Their response times and coordination may be slower than expected. Western missile defences can prove to be a bit more effective. Their submarines may be easier to detect and intercepted.  

But these things matter if you think of nuclear war as winnable. First, we tend not to do that for the sake of humanity. Second, some of these ""issues"" may lead to things spiralling out of control rather than make it easier for the west to win. For example, what happens if a Russian submarine gets cut off from command and found by the US navy? The captain must choose between sinking with the nukes or firing them, which may mean a significant escalation.
