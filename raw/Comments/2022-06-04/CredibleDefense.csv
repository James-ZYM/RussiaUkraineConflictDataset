China will straddle both sectors, producing its own chips but also using and developing western origin chip for higher end commercial purposes.

Hanlon's razor tbh.

They are not a NATO army. They do not have NATO weaponry or training. Thus you cannot directly compare this conflict to the sort of conflict we normally see on TV. It's also our explicit policy (and has been for years) to stop them being able to procure PGMs and other advanced equipment.

Obviously i'm not saying we should provide them with advanced weapons, but what's the expectation? That they run out of PGMs and then just pack up and call it a day? Every single aspect of the Russian army and their current status makes collateral damage more likely without it even needing to be intentional or strategic.

Of course it could be intentional, but i've no idea how you can claim so with such confidence. What's the margin of error on a 40 year old artillery unit anyway? I'm assuming it's not great

Adjacent to these houses are residential buildings, including a school. The first salvo of 18 rounds is fired with sloppy aiming procedures and just one of the rounds hits on target. Two rounds detonate in the school area, and the rest in the residential area. The damage is massive – sadly, a common scenario in contemporary armed conflicts.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"Sorry, didn't mean to straw man you. That bit doesn't make sense in this context because the person I originally replied to specifically was talking about a collapsing front. But I think my main arguments apply here. 

Good plans take into account and sometimes even take advantage of the fact that your own troops may be routed. If the Ukrainians fumbled a bit and recovered really well, that's not substantially different from successfully executing the same maneuver but specifically with the intent to draw the Russians into overextending. Either they had a really good plan in place to draw the Russians into an ambush, or they had a really good plan for recovering from any rout of the forces in Severodonetsk. Whichever is the case, their plans accounted for the possibility of the Russians becoming overextending while taking the city, which is what enabled them to counterattack successfully so quickly. And that sounds pretty much like a premeditated trap. 

I'm willing to bet they actually had plans for both contingencies (forced retreat and feigned retreat), because they are really obvious contingencies that they have had a lot of time to plan for. I think some of yall may be overestimating how clever of a maneuver this was. Feigned retreats are one of the oldest tricks in the book. Anyone who has seen the movie *The Patriot* is familiar with the concept. A professional army officer is going to consider the possibility almost constantly during a drawn out defense in depth like this battle. 

And it's not suspicious that it happened right when they looked like they were at a breaking point. Because even if they were holding strong, they would have to fake being at the breaking point for a feigned retreat to work. I don't think that's the case here, but the point being that a feigned retreat will always happen near or apparently near to the withdrawing force's breaking point. 

In this case they probably were legitimately near their breaking point, but how they handled it is revealing. If they were near collapse, the commander would have had three basic choices: (1) commit their reserves to reinforce the existing line of contact, (2) execute a tactical withdrawal to preserve strength, or (3) order the forward deployed troops to keep fighting as long as possible and then wait for them to collapse and fall back to a secondary defensive line. We know it was either (2) or (3) because they withheld their reserves, likely intending to use them either to hold the secondary defensive line in Lysychansk in case of a rout or for a spoiling attack. Given the brutal simplicity of the tactical calculus here, you can be virtually certain that the Ukrainian officers considered each contingency and so made an intentional choice to allocate their reserves for holding a fallback position and preparing a possible counterattack (ie, for setting a trap). They would also have to be blind idiots not to recognize that risking rout in SD could function as bait for a trap when they made that choice. As would retreating quickly in good order, which is what seems to have happened.

They didn't need to know 100% for sure that the Russians would walk into the trap by overextending themselves to plan for the possibility. The Ukrainian officers absolutely would have known that there was some risk the Russians would proceed carefully enough through the city to prevent a counterattack, in which case the reserves would still be in a good position to hold Lysychansk. But I absolutely believe they knowingly rolled the dice hoping this might be the outcome.",eea48e3014072517d45d71880da7b0e2e7e40ffc,True,False,,,,,0,1654382339,,0,{},ib6wgyl,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib6k8xz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib6wgyl/,1654382355,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654353539.0

So the weapons being given to Ukraine from before the war and even now, are being carefully calibrated to not escalate tensions between the US and Russia, and their proxies. I think that short range ballistic missiles have far too many downsides for conventional and even nuclear escalation for them to be considered. 

I think that Russia's supply problems were deliberately mitigated by reducing the scope of the war to the Donbas region. So I doubt that conventional ballistic missiles would matter much there. 

Ukraine will be helped by the rocket and tube artillery that is on the way over there, as long as it is being sent in enough quantity. If sent in the right numbers and used correctly, this should be enough to change the military balance in Ukraine's favor.

[],False,,LordOfBirds,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fmejac0,False,False,"Taking a break from the Severodonetsk drama to bring something else to your attention. 

Let's revisit the Kharkiv offensive. The Ukrainians attacked and found the defensive lines manned by the mobilized LDPR troops. These units, poorly equipped and untrained, fled allowing the AFU to advance to the border. Then the Russian regular troops showed up, pushed back a little to create a small buffer to protect Belgorod and called it a day.  

This didn't really seem strange to me since I knew that the Kharkiv sector was not important for Russians as they have given up on trying to take the city. However, then the Kherson offensive happened and the warinUkraine channel stated that they learned that the reason why the AFU troops initially quickly advanced and took Davydiv Brid and some other nearby villages was that the line was manned again by the LDPR troops. Then the Ukrainian advance was slowed by the artillery and air strikes and finally checked by the regular Russian troops.

(Something to keep in mind is that the LDPR mobilized troops were mobilized for 3 months and were supposed to have been sent home already and they were supposed to fight on the territory of Donbas, not in Kherson or Kharkiv.)

So the LDPR mobs were used as the first line of defense both in Kharkiv and Kherson sectors, but the difference is that the Kherson sector is strategically important. So you would think that Russians would use better troops to defend it. Instead they seem to use the same defensive strategy everywhere where they are not attacking: put low quality LDPR troops on the first line. When the AFU attacks and advances, slow them down with artillery and aviation, then send the mobile reserve of regular Russian troops to take control of the situation.

This tells me that the Russians are attempting to use almost all freely available frontline troops for offensive operations and use as few as possible to defend even in important sectors. This indicates that Russians indeed have a severe manpower issue that is reaching a critical point. Based on this I can conclude two things.

First is that while they may take Severodonetsk and Lysichansk as well as the surrounding areas, they are unlikely to have enough strength to either directly capture or surround and besiege the Slovyanks-Kramatorsk urban agglomeration (unless the Ukrainian lines unexpectedly collapse from losses, for which we have no indication so far). 

Second is that if Ukraine is able to concentrate a large enough force (at least 2-3 brigades) with an adequate amount of armor and artillery support, it can potentially attack and advance deep behind the Russian defensive lines, before the Russian mobile reserve has a chance to arrive and stop them. So a big advantage can be achieved before the Russians can do anything about it.",6aeaf364b9cd10d8a43c82c27f651d5f3268a064,True,False,,,,,0,1654377871,,0,{},ib6o24f,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t3_v4neox,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib6o24f/,1654377883,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654349071.0

Failing that, a commando raid in ribs to knock that bridge out.

So, what do you think, can Ukraine win without more severing of supply lines? Or can they just wait Russia out. They WILL run out of soldiers eventually and I think there will be a collapse of their lines soon enough.

But let's say they're on the verge of losing Donbas and Russia keeping that and Crimea. Can the West afford to let the world see that once again, might makes right?

It doesn't take long to put a recruit in uniform, hand him a weapon, teach the recruit how to use a weapon properly, how to build emplacements, and other rudimentary skills, then send recruits to the front line to hold a defensive position. A week, at most - but the tradeoff is that those recruits don't have any practical offensive capability. And they may not be very effective on defense once the shells are incoming and the enemy is advancing.

Ideally, several months of training would yield troops who are semi-proficient at holding and taking territory. Months allow recruits to gel with their units, learn necessary skills, and develop confidence in their command that command isn't just going to feed those troops into the meatgrinder and forget about them. 

Ofc, this doesn't include technical skills; it can take a half year or longer for troops to learn and master complex systems. 

If Ukraine has developed a tiered training system where there is a strategic reserve (for lack of a better phrase) to be available in the next few months for counterattacks, then we may see the tide of war shift significantly. If not, and the UAF is just feeding people into the meatgrinder, then we're looking at a war of attrition for the foreseeable future.

Consider: many, if not most drones seeing usage right now are either literally off the shelf commercial drones, or else made with primarily commercial parts. This may change somewhat in the future, but seems unlikely that an entirely novel transmission system will become widespread to the point where it becomes possible to commercially buy a the laser gimbal required. Also, it seems very likely that in high-intensity fronts, drone warfare will soon become very contested — hard kill measures are becoming very popular to develop, and a laser link will do very little against that.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"Drones were mentioned several times in the article. Drones are traditionally controlled by radio link, which introduces a number of vulnerabilities. Radio links can be denied or degraded by jamming, radio traffic can be analyzed to identify drones and locate operators or base stations, and if the channel is not cryptographically secure, operators could be fed false or flawed information.

A lot of the consumer-grade and civilian drones that are given after-market militarization are not made with security in mind. They are, fundamentally, flying computers - a small, low-powered but still capable system, probably running Linux. So if you can establish a network connection with them, you can interact with them like they're ordinary computers. The consumer-grade manufacturers - even some higher end ones who make professional-grade ones for aerial photography and such - don't necessarily secure them well. Or at all.

So when you fly your wonderful semi-militarized drones over contested territory, against a sophisticated adversary that is specifically known for its hacking prowess, are you collecting valuable intelligence, or are you sending them flying network vulnerabilities just waiting for exploitation?

All of that makes me wonder if optical, laser networking is the future for drones. A laser-optical link is more secure. It's difficult for adversaries to detect, exploit, or interfere with. To jam a well-designed laser network, you basically need to physically block the space between the transmitter and receiver. It has excellent EMCON (emissions control). And, conveniently, laser links can have *far* higher bandwidth than traditional radio links for the same power. The drawbacks are range, size, and complexity. For all-weather use you'd want an IR laser, and even high-quality, industrial-grade IR lasers for high-speed networking have effective ranges of 5 km or less. And those are perhaps a bit more bulky and have higher power draw than you might want on all your drones. You'd probably overcome that by putting up multiple dedicated networking drones form a chain back to your location. The math and engineering of maintaining a laser network among multiple aircraft maneuvering in 3D is also non-trivial, to say the least.",55f7701850b3362600188988997a2585bf374c4f,True,False,,,,,0,1654375566,,0,{},ib6jn8f,False,t3_v4tjbo,False,True,t3_v4tjbo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4tjbo/deadly_secret_electronic_warfare_shapes/ib6jn8f/,1654375581,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654346766.0

All defensive tactics are to degrade the enemy, that's not strategy. Ukraine strategy is what they're exactly wanting to do to win the war. Suggesting that battalion level counterattacks is how they're accomplishing it is wrong, a totally different level of warfare. Static defenses and counterattacks are their tactics to attrit the Russians to weaken them to remove their ability to attack anymore in the Donbas is the operational goal supporting a strategy to drive the Russians out and liberate occupied Ukraine as the strategy.

&gt;I'm not sure if you have some sort of insider information, but we simply are not getting enough data to support this claim at all.

Yes we do. We have near daily updates with maps that show retreats, tactical victories and failures for both sides, and the president of Ukraine giving up high casualty figures while the maps show they're going out of their way not to retreat. It doesn't take a general staff grad to know what that means.

&gt;Well except...you know...the Wehrmacht were actually getting fully encircled and surrendering to the Red Army and this has not been demonstrated in Ukraine.

Those were done in the maneuver centric part of phase 1 when Sumy and Chernihiv were encircled. Luckily for them the encirclements broke because the Russians performed a strategic retreat from that whole front. So Mariupol was the only battle of encirclement the UA lost.

Meanwhile, now we're seeing another potential encirclement, bigger than the others, with no strategic outcome that will cause a front wide Russian retreat from the Donbas and thus no apparent way to relieve it. Only 10,000 meters to go... 

&gt;This isn't me spinning positivity, this is looking at the last 4 months of people claiming Ukrainian forces were at risk of being encircled only for Russia to lack the ability to move with necessary pace. 

Don't lump me in with other posters. I'm not ""people"" and I'm not arguing something that happened four months ago, nor am I generalized. I'm analyzing a current operation and addressing credible outcomes. If you don't agree with my analysis, focus on that. Not by burning mid March era strawmen.

&gt;Given how they have managed to avoid the numerous previous encirclement claims, and Russia's general lack of ability to capitalize on them, I think it is generally a good bet that they do find 5-6 bdes destroyed in Severodonetsk.

Your last sentence seems to be a typo so I'll make believe you meant they don't find 5-6 UAs brigade destroyed. 

But by bringing up past encirclements you're using past campaigns as examples without understanding what actually happened. 

The UA didn't avoid encirclements, as I showed above. Nor did they tactically or operationally relieve those that did occur. They did excellently block Kyiv itself from the Russians, to the point the city couldn't be taken without massive reinforcements, and even then its strategic value was very limited. Without Kyiv as a strategic target there is no point to any Russian forces being anywhere west of Kharkiv. So the Russians voluntarily retreated, which broke the sieges of Sumy and Chernihiv.

But like Mariupol, there is zero indication of any reason for the Russians to abandon the Donbas front. It's actually their strongest and where their forces are both the most heavily concentrated and best supported. So if an encirclement occurs, and it quite possibly will, they cannot hope the Russians will retreat to relieve them.",edf654437311494c6c03b46672d9bffc7d64d912,True,False,,,,,0,1654373814,,0,{},ib6gc1i,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib67oro,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib6gc1i/,1654373827,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654345014.0

&gt; Well, yes, obviously they have been in retreat in the area for a few days. The question is whether it is a controlled withdrawal or a rout.

&gt; In this case, the Ukrainians are fighting a defense in depth, which is essentially one long chain of fighting withdrawals. Withdrawal is considered one of the riskiest maneuvers for any military because it requires so much discipline to execute in good order without tipping into an actual rout. Even under the best of circumstances it can be difficult to distinguish orderly fighting withdrawals from headlong, uncontrolled retreat. In no small part because the withdrawing army has an incentive to feign actual panicked retreat to draw the enemy into overextending and to maintain the element of surprise when counterattacking. If you think you just kicked the other side's ass so hard that they completely broke and ran away, you're more likely to let your guard down as you enter a suddenly peaceful area for the first time in a long time.

&gt; Whether they cleverly plotted out a feigned retreat or simply opportunistically exploited a sudden opportunity isn't really that important. Although I will say feigned retreats are a super common tactic, so it really isn't out of the realm of possibility that it really was intentional, even if that is less likely than a forced retreat. More importantly, the fact that they were in a position to take advantage of the Russian complacency at all shows that they are in an orderly retreat.

&gt; - Their troops were able to withdraw across the river in good order after breaking contact with the enemy. So without continuing to fight as they moved through the city. In a rout, the enemy tends to be following hard on the retreating army's heels in an effort to inflict maximum casualties, unless they are incompetent or exhausted themselves. So we can safely assume either it wasn't a rout or the Russians were too incompetent or exhausted to exploit the withdrawal, or all of the above.
&gt; - Following this withdrawal, the Ukrainians continued to monitor the areas they had withdrawn from, and were able to identify an opportunity to counterattack.
&gt; - The Ukrainians immediately exploited that opportunity either with some well-positioned reserves or by turning around the retreating units themselves (less likely if they were routed and/or it wasn't a feigned retreat, because then they would need time to reset). In either case, the Ukrainian forces as a whole are exhibiting excellent discipline, battlefield awareness, and tactical flexibility. That implies solid command and control, which is impressive during such a challenging series of maneuvers conducted under grueling conditions.

&gt; In the end, it's almost inevitable that some percentage of units will be forced into a disorganized retreat during a long term defense in depth. The key is to plan for failure, with well-placed fallback positions and reserves.

&gt; In this case, they're probably doing OK so long as they keep any routs localized and reestablish a defensive line quickly enough to prevent any breakouts or flanking maneuvers against other Ukrainian units. That meets their objective of buying time for resources from the west to come into play. They're doing better than OK if they meet their secondary objective of inflicting disproportionate casualties on the Russians while withdrawing, which this counterattack seems to have helped achieve.

&gt; All of which indicates that it probably isn't a collapsing front in the sense that you seem to mean it. Which isn't to say everything looks peachy for the Ukrainians, or that local routs aren't happening. Conditions are clearly desperate, and it would of course be much better if the Russians were literally incapable of making any progress whatsoever anywhere at all. But even with the Russians applying the maximum amount of pressure they can muster into the smallest area possible, the Ukrainians bearing the brunt of that pressure seem to still be fighting a cool-headed, careful battle of attrition.",efb2416d5c948d3b29f0844f6e7a735c2ac5014b,True,False,,,,,0,1654373062,,0,{},ib6eynp,False,t3_v4neox,False,False,t1_ib625w8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib6eynp/,1654373079,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654344262.0

&gt;In May 2022, the MCST announced the construction of a new plant for the production of microchips using 28-nanometer technology. The plan originally envisaged sourcing necessary equipment from Dutch photolithography giant ASML. No details have yet been revealed regarding how the plant planned to resolve its dependency on European chipmakers and set up its own production from scratch.

The short answer is, they're not. The only litho machine manufacturer not located in an US allied country is China's SMEE, and their 28nm lithography machine is still in the trial phase with SMIC, and therefore very unlikely to be used. The other alternative is Nikon, which is Japanese.

&gt;  In March, the government reported that 50,000 to 70,000 IT specialists left the country.

I'm also not sure how this figure has any relevance to the discussion - on the hardware side you need engineers, physicists and chemists. Not IT specialists, who mainly work either on the software side or on the system administration side. Perhaps the authors were not too familiar with who works in what industry?

&gt; In fact, no country has complete control over its semiconductor supply

Not *entirely* correct. The US can theoretically create a production like with only US made equipment, but that's about it.

&gt; Exact details on the stockpiles of critical components are unavailable, but as Russia is heading into a war of attrition, the restrictions will start to bite. An inspection of weaponry covered by Western export controls shows that...

This paragraph lists examples of foreign made components used in Russian weapons systems, but the issue here is that none of the examples are irreplaceable. Most if not all can be replaced with ready made consumer parts, and those that can't can be manufactured in Russia's existing fabs (if they are still operating). Of more concern is foreign made electronic *systems* that cannot be replaced with such parts, and for which drop in replacements does not exist.

&gt;  For the military and civilian industries, reverse industrialization means relying on chips of domestic production that are 15 or 20 years behind the current standards, or establishing new supply chains via third countries or smuggling.

Again, given that existing military applications are most likely running decades old technology already, I doubt that this would be of much concern. Consumer electronics are much more severely impacted.

&gt; Beijing could potentially supply chips of lower quality to Russia. 

Again, I don't necessarily understand what the authors mean. If we are talking about fabrication processes, then it either works or it doesn't. There is no such thing as a lower quality microprocessor when comparing one made on one node to one made on another. If we are talking about ready made processors, then ""lower quality"" would be such a generalisation that I wouldn't really know where to begin to disprove it. You just have to find one that fits your requirements and if they are using readily available microprocessors, I highly doubt that they require such precision that they could not source the part from China.

&gt; Switching to the Chinese suppliers would require time and money for Russian users to adapt

This is true, and the authors understated this severely. Each fab has their own, very different, node design. Each chip design therefore is custom made for a specific node, and switching fabs would require significant amounts of time and effort.

&gt; Western and Asian components vary in their quality and design.

See comment re: lower quality chips. While this is true of electronic *systems*, it is rarely true for microprocessors.

Ultimately, I agree with their conclusion, and the analysis overall is sound. However, it is clear that the authors are not familiar with the semiconductor industry and are largely taking the analysis from a political/economics point of view. Compared to the authors, I would very much assert that the only reason that China isn't supplying Russia is due to geopolitical factors and not any inherent technological limitation. Taking the view that China cannot satisfy military demand with its existing semiconductor technologies would be overestimating the requirement for military applications and underestimating both China and Russia's indigenous capabilities.",e3916287a1de1609b81a12d78cea7b4beeba2979,True,False,,,,,0,1654369617,,0,{},ib68q7p,True,t3_v4twqt,False,True,t1_ib68pn2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4twqt/can_russia_rebuild_its_tech_sector_with_chinas/ib68q7p/,1654369631,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654340817.0

I think this is an excellent example of diplomatic and economic analysts writing about technology (specifically semiconductors and microelectronics) without a clear understanding of how it works. While I agree with their overall conclusion, there are multiple assertions that I would very much disagree with, and others that I don't believe are emphasised enough.

The implications of the foreign direct product rule cannot be overstated, especially within the semiconductor supply chain. Due to its extremely globalised nature, the US, whilst it maintains its economic and technological hegemony, can essentially cut off any country it wants from access to any sort of semiconductor technology developed within the last 20 years. Its actions on Huawei, SMIC and various Chinese companies has essentially forced the Chinese government to attempt to develop its own supply chain, independent of the US. While Huawei is allegedly in a partnership with SMIC to construct a 45nm (or 28nm, reporting around this is quite hazy) fab, its not expected to be operational for some years (plans allegedly claim 2021 but that has not materialised. Other sources claim 2022, but likewise it has yet to materialise). Even so, 45nm is only enough for IoT devices and other low power semiconductor devices, and not nearly advanced enough for modern SoC designs for consumer or office use. It is not only China who have sought to diversify away from the US however, amidst the trade war there has been growing calls for EU to diversify away from the US and consolidate its own technology industry, both in fear of alienating either side but also the implication that US export controls could threaten European sovereignty. The use of such export controls have therefore demonstrated its extremely powerful nature but also the potential backfiring of its intended effects in the long run.

Ironically for a field that can change within weeks, it can takes decades to set-up facilities and longer still for research. Reflecting this, Russia's plans appear to be over a similar timescale (2020-2030, 2021-2026), and something that this implies that the article did not mention is that Russian officials did not expect to be hit with sanctions this hard. This is only emphasised with the low stockpiles, since even if Ukraine had folded within weeks, Russian officials would have known that sanctions would make sourcing of foreign made equipments and parts almost impossible - Huawei is the most notable example of that. Therefore, the conclusion that can be drawn is that not only did Russia underestimate Ukrainian resistance, they also severely underestimated the Western response. 

Here is where we run into my first criticism of the article however - the claim that Russian analogues are too energy intensive and only capable of performing simple tasks is sourced back to a wccftech article with the claim that the Baikal CPU is equivalent to the 7300T. While it is outdated, the 7300T is also perfectly fine for office use. For the millions of regular PCs that are in use across the Russian government, the Baikal CPU is a viable replacement. Likewise, the fact that the MCST servers were ruled out due to performance demonstrates its capability to perform vital tasks required by a bank, albeit perhaps much slower. Due to both using open source architectures, neither is really affected by sanctions since they can essentially ignore licensing and continue to design their microprocessors. 

The real issue with both of these however is software support. ARM support on Windows is, well, poor, even for major corporations like Qualcomm. Combine that with sanctions and would be impossible for Microsoft to add in support for Baikal CPUs. Without it, unless Russia has spent the last couple of years developing its own software ecosystem like China has, the CPUs are useless even if they ""work"". SPARC, as an architecture that is even less widely available than ARM, is even worse. Within the server market (for which SPARC is designed for), software support is usually custom designed for the hardware that they are running, and adopting a different architecture usually requires a rewrite of the software from the ground up. Hence, even though performance-wise both appear satisfactory, software support is going to be the biggest challenge to overcome.

I am not sure about what they mean in the following three paragraphs, which seem to contradict each other:

&gt; The country’s leading chipmaker, the Mikron Group, is similarly dependent on foreign components and manufacturers [sic] Mikron has mastered the local production of semiconductors with 180-nanometer circuitries...

&gt; The only Russian attempt to launch a factory capable of producing semiconductors failed: Angstrem-T, which specialized in semiconductors and chips, went bankrupt after being targeted by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2018.

Mikron is described as being able to produce semiconductors yet the article claims that the only Russian attempt to launch a factory capable of producing semiconductors failed? Not entirely sure what the authors meant there, but disregarding that, I want to focus on this claim:

&gt; Mikron has mastered the local production of semiconductors with 180-nanometer circuitries and 90-nanometer circuitries, but not for mass production

This is actually enough to supply the demand for most military applications. For references, both the Tejas and F22 use the Intel i960 as their core processor, which is a design from 1984 built on the 1500nm node. Military applications prefer to use mature nodes due to their ready availability and more preferential electronic characteristics (e.g. more resistant to radiation and EM wave interference). The problem however is that Mikron is likely using equipment that, while it may not be from the US, is from a country that has likewise applied sanctions. Since most fab equipment operate in a black box environment where only contracted service engineers can access the internals, repairs or modifications is likely impossible, and while operators can reconfigure the machines, any fault is likely to cause the entire production line to fail permanently without access to the service engineers.

It's literally a counterattack to regain part of the city which they then have to defend, which they already proved they can't. While the  expanding Popansa axis proves they shouldn't.

&gt;We have seen reports that Russia is reinforcing the forces in the city itself, and if those forces are coming from the areas where Russia is pushing west, then that is very beneficial for Ukraine as it could stall the advance. 

Yeah, we've heard this since the beginning of the offensive when Ukraine was massing and conducting spoiling attacks in Kharkiv and Izyum and Severodonetsk all to try to do what you're claiming they're now going to be accomplished. Meanwhile the Russians still managed to find the manpower to not only continuously shrink the salient but dangerously threaten its southern shoulder. 

Do you think the Russians will bite this time and use their reserves and shift forces to reinforce Severodonetsk when they didn't bite to earlier spoiling attacks before? That they'll ignore planning for a new offensive in the Popansa axis to drive only 10,000 meters further west cut the T0513, which gains them Severodonetsk without even needing to assault it?

That's a real dangerous gamble. 

&gt;I think by and large, over the last few months there have been nonstop ""doomerism"" for lack of better words over the risks of encirclements.

That sounds like the stuff Hitler used to claim during the latter half of WW2, that defeatist attitude was why they lost the war, that it was just a matter of willpower and positivity. 

&gt;The Russian military has not shown the ability to move fast enough to pull off any true encirclements since the surprise in the first few weeks, and I don't foresee them getting faster.

The Russians already cut by fire one of the two critical MSRs the Ukrainians need to keep the salient in the fight. The Russians only need to move just enough troops 10 km west to cut the only remaining road. If the UAF can't stop that (and they've not stopped the previous attacks) then it'll be a race between the Russian advance and an evacuation of around 5-6 brigades worth of troops and equipment plus an untold number of Ukraine refugees. 

Warfare is gambling. How much are you willing to to bet the UAF win that race? 

Considering from the beginning of this battle that Severodonetsk and Lysychansk were both in serious jeopardy of being lost (within a few km of the front lines), and that there is no operational or strategic requirement to hold either, it's a really stupid bet to go ""all in"" operationally to ignore the very real risk of encirclement. Especially just to keep possession of a destroyed city because way down the road they dont want to conduct an extra 1-2 assault river crossings on top of the scores they'll need to conduct elsewhere.

This won't be like Mariupol, whose defenders were encircled without any way at the time to prevent it. If a 5-6 bde encirclement occurs in the Severodonetsk salient it'll have been 100% preventable and only caused by bad generaling.",19d1d0b6ce79d2c8ef67c277a6001b27df06f188,True,False,,,,,0,1654368075,,0,{},ib65wa2,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib5zat6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib65wa2/,1654368091,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654339275.0

\- Nuances in use? Ammunition? For the task did you take the BC only in mechanized stacking? A typical composition of the BC (proportion: OPS, CS, ""crowbars"")? Or was it filled differently for a particular task? What type of ammunition was used most often? Was the main ""crowbar"" still 3B42?  
Is the ATGM a suitcase without a handle, or a really useful thing? Is it realistic to implement the ""long arm"" of our tanks in the combat conditions of the current theater of war? Have you ever used it? If yes, then nuances, reliability, were there any failures of guidance and what was their reason? From personal experience: what ammunition would need to be refined or created?  
Tanker:  
\- Never had more than 10 shells in the armor. I also know from experience of fighting around Donetsk airport what happens to a combat vehicle when it is full of ammunition. When an RPG shell comes from the floor into the commander's hatch, the turret flies to the 3rd floor of the terminal. Our vis-a-vis decided to ignore this simple truth and were always full to capacity, for which they were nicknamed ""a herd of lemmings"" among the unit.  
There was nothing but ""Mango"" at the beginning of the operation, the ammunition was expended so quickly that there was no way to replenish it. About the ""long arm"" I will answer as succinctly as I can.  
You can, but it's a pain in the ass. Making calculations in order to hit an enclosed standing target (God forbid even a moving one) is extremely inconvenient, and makes you think up a bicycle on the spot, based on the specifics of the terrain.  
There is an urgent need for concrete-cannon weapons, taking into account NATO's methodology for building fortifications.  
Author:  
\- Observation. Did you perform tasks at night? How does the commander conduct surveillance at night? How did the sighting equipment perform? At what distances on average was it possible to detect the enemy?  
Tanker:  
\- Armored formations perform deep night missions only when operating from closed positions. Ideally, if a tank group advances to an assault, it is better to do it at 2 or 3 in the morning and reach the point of engagement by dusk. Sighting equipment is obsolete, to be replaced. But at the stage of fighting the tanks of the USSR, though modernized, it is not critical. Thanks to the infantry and the coordinated work of the Akhmat, we always knew where the enemy and how to move.

Author:  
\- Tank dueling? Or tanks with tanks do not fight (c)? Is there a problem with defeating enemy tanks? How do you rate the T-80 BVM's resistance to modern anti-tank weapons? What is the skill of the enemy?  
Tanker:  
\- Tank duels in this theater are very much in demand on our part, and we are trying to enforce them. Our superiority in reverse speed and the ability to board the enemy gives us the ability to never lose these duels at all. And since Ukrainian tanks are packed to the brim with ammunition, we don't need more than one hit.  
As for the resistance to domestic - a solid 5. It's more complicated about the Western ones, since we didn't give them a chance to work on us. But it seems to me that tandem shells could be a problem for us, but there is always the good old net for that.

There's zero reason to believe this. Ukrainian forces were retreating in good order, it's not like their lines broke and they fled. 

Everything points to the notion that this was planned in advance. Ukraine knew that Russia needs the city, and Russia ""knew"" that Ukraine was going to have trouble holding the city. So when Ukrainian forces kept pulling back, they pursued expecting little resistance, and then when they were overextended Ukraine hit them with a major counterattack. 

It's the perfect place to do this too, as Ukrainian artillery in Lyshansk hold the high ground and can pound Russian positions with ease. Ukraine also has a major advantage in infantry/manpower who shine the most in urban warfare, while Russian forces have a serious lack of infantry. So Ukraine poured infantry into the city and hit the overextended Russians hard, driving them back. Not sure about rumors of ""killzones"" and traps though, but I wouldn't be surprised. 

&gt;In the end it will still fall, but it will take longer than it would have otherwise.

The russians don't have to envelope the whole territory east of Popasna. Just to have three sides surrounding the bulk at Severodonetsk leads to russian artillery having a huge advantage. It is probably impossible for Ukraine to conduct counter artillery fire there with three sides covering them. Maybe Ukraine can only counter attack in urban and forest areas, because of a lack of armor. Operationally it would be better to contain the russians at Popasna.",6fab6c1055546674b1354f5e20e00f58ae862d28,True,False,,,,,0,1654366467,,0,{},ib62xj9,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib5m4b1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib62xj9/,1654366484,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654337667.0

&gt; The far-reaching export controls the United States and others imposed in response to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine were meant to have long-term erosive effects, but their impact on Russia has already been tangible. 

&gt; Moscow’s attempts to kick-start homegrown production of semiconductors and electronic components, which started in 2021, have unsurprisingly produced meager results, and the Western technology required to launch an indigenous chip sector is now further out of reach. 

&gt; China will thus play a crucial role in the future of Russia’s tech sector, but a complicated one. While China’s geopolitical sympathies lie with Russia, active support would likely run afoul of the allied export controls and put China’s own chip ambitions at risk.

&gt; U.S. export controls, including sanctions, are extended extraterritorially through the foreign direct product rule. The foreign direct product rule means that the U.S. export controls apply not just to chips produced in the United States but also to chips made in any foreign location, if the foreign producer is using U.S. equipment, tools, or software. Since the United States currently enjoys dominance in chipmaking equipment and software, this rule creates an effective global chokepoint for nearly all chips produced anywhere in the world.

&gt; If a manufacturer like TSMC ships products to Russia in violation of the U.S. foreign direct product rule, it would risk enforcement actions that could jeopardize its own supply of U.S. chip equipment and software. So too would manufacturers in China, which needless to say is not participating in the export controls. This weaponization of the chip supply chain curtails Russia’s access to high-end chips, which will have repercussions across the country’s digital economy and military capabilities.

&gt; The Russian military is reportedly forced to use computer chips from dishwashers and refrigerators in some military equipment. The quicker-than-expected impact indicates that the industries did not anticipate such broad use of export controls as a sanctions tool and did not foresee a need to stockpile imported items ahead of time.

&gt; Moscow’s attempts to kickstart homegrown production and manufacturing of semiconductors and electronic components came belatedly. In January 2020, the government approved a “Development Strategy for the Electronics Industry” through 2030. The strategy aimed to increase the share of Russian-made electronic products on the domestic market (in terms of revenues) to 59 percent. In October 2021, Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade announced that it will spend 1.2 billion roubles to build up the domestic semiconductors industry, with the launch scheduled for 2026. 

&gt; Unsurprisingly, the late start on import substitution efforts, modest state support, and lack of qualified specialists did not add up to any meaningful results. Baikal Electronics and the Moscow Center for SPARC Technologies (MCST) are the only two Russian manufacturers of domestic processors, which are meant to become viable alternatives to two American companies, Intel and AMD. Russian analogues also lag in performance — they are too energy-intensive and are only capable of performing easy tasks. [NOTE: source here claimed that Baikal CPUs are only equivalent to a low power Intel CPU from 2017, and the source for that is from WCCFTech, which is a notoriously unreliable leaker]

&gt; The country’s leading chipmaker, the Mikron Group, is similarly dependent on foreign components and manufacturers. To illustrate the level of Russia’s technological backwardness in this area: Mikron has mastered the local production of semiconductors with 180-nanometer circuitries and 90-nanometer circuitries, but not for mass production, while Taiwan’s TSMC is embarking on the production of semiconductors of 2 nanometers. Since the global pandemic, Mikron has been experiencing difficulties with the supply of materials. The latest sanctions aggravated the situation, as the company lost access to foreign equipment. The only Russian attempt to launch a factory capable of producing semiconductors failed: Angstrem-T, which specialized in semiconductors and chips, went bankrupt after being targeted by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2018.

&gt;  Acknowledging the impact of the measures, Vladimir Putin expressed the need for deep structural changes to the Russian economy. After February 2022, it became clear that the Russian industry for chips and semiconductors would have to be created from scratch, cutting out any dependency on foreign manufacturers. The updated plan seeks to reverse-engineer foreign technology and transfer production to Russia and China, as well as make every component that it currently imports by 2024. 

&gt; In May 2022, the MCST announced the construction of a new plant for the production of microchips using 28-nanometer technology. The plan originally envisaged sourcing necessary equipment from Dutch photolithography giant ASML. No details have yet been revealed regarding how the plant planned to resolve its dependency on European chipmakers and set up its own production from scratch.

&gt; The lack of a qualified workforce is another problem the Russian industry is facing. However, the new wave of domestic repression following the war in Ukraine has accelerated the brain drain, and will only aggravate the situation further. In March, the government reported that 50,000 to 70,000 IT specialists left the country. Russian officials announced that the Russian economy will need about 1 million specialists.

&gt; Achieving self-sufficiency in such a complex domain as chips and semiconductors is a tall order. Deep structural changes require lavish financing, ample time to catch up with technological advancement, and a great deal of international cooperation to spur innovations. None of that is possible, as Russia has reached North Korean levels of isolation. Complete onshoring of the industry is impossible in an industry known for complex and globalized processes. No country has complete control over its semiconductor supply, as these complex value chains cross borders multiple times. Even China, with its lavish state subsidies and “national tech champions,” is struggling to climb the semiconductor value chain, let alone achieve self-sufficiency.

&gt; Exact details on the stockpiles of critical components are unavailable, but as Russia is heading into a war of attrition, the restrictions will start to bite. An inspection of weaponry covered by Western export controls shows that Russian military equipment is highly reliant on foreign chips and semiconductors. The Iskander-M, the Kalibr, and the Kh-101 cruise missiles are reliant on a British-designed oscillator in the computer controlling. The 9M727 cruise missile uses U.S.-manufactured circuit boards. The components of Russia’s military tactical communication are sourced from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Israel, and Japan.

&gt; As Russian domestic production lags, doubling down on the pivot to Asia — namely, China — could alleviate a certain amount of pressure from export control restrictions. 

&gt; In the short term, China has limited potential to supplant Western high-end components. Reducing dependence on Western semiconductors has been a national priority for over a decade. However, achieving self-sufficiency has been fraught, and Chinese tech giants continue relying on U.S. design, equipment, and technology. Beijing could potentially supply chips of lower quality to Russia. However, satisfying Russia’s demand for high-end chips will be difficult, given the global shortage of electronics and China’s lack of capabilities at the cutting edge of the chip sector. Switching to the Chinese suppliers would require time and money for Russian users to adapt. Western and Asian components vary in their quality and design.

&gt; Another way for Russia to evade export control restrictions would be to relocate the production of Russian domestic processors from Taiwanese TSMC to Chinese SMIC, but it is unlikely that SMIC would be willing to violate U.S. sanctions or export controls outright. The Chinese semiconductor company continues using American chipmaking equipment, even after it was placed on the Entity List in 2020. SMIC will not want to invite further U.S. scrutiny. Violating U.S. sanctions is not in Beijing’s national interests as it would likely jeopardize its own access to the foreign technology on which it still uncomfortably relies.

&gt; In the long term, Beijing’s intensified push for indigenization and technological independence has the potential to sufficiently decouple the country from Western technology. By 2025, Beijing aims to onshore up to 70 percent of the semiconductor production. In the same vein, Chinese chip-makers are testing production lines without U.S. technology. Driven by a shared desire to circumvent the U.S. nexus, Sino-Russian high-tech cooperation could intensify.

&gt; 

Correct, but a strategy of continually doing small counterattacks IS strategic, which is what I said. 

&gt;Is increasing the amount of defenders into the salient the smart move just to gain a small tactical victory to temporarily reclaim part of a city that holds almost no immediate tactical, operational, or strategic importance?

It is if you feel you can inflict a worthwhile amount of attrition to potentially over-extended enemy forces before pulling back. 

&gt;From the beginning of this offensive the one way the Ukrainians could screw this up was doing what they're doing now, trading lives for space and risking a large encirclement.

This is where I think we disagree. I don't see this as a counterattack simply to gain land. I see it as an attack to draw Russian forces into a battle where Ukraine has a temporary advantage and can stall the movement. We have seen reports that Russia is reinforcing the forces in the city itself, and if those forces are coming from the areas where Russia is pushing west, then that is very beneficial for Ukraine. 

I think by and large, over the last few months there have been nonstop ""doomerism"" for lack of better words over the risks of encirclements.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Seems like a continuation of Ukraine's strategy of waiting until Russia is extended to a point of vulnerability and then counter attacking.

A small counterattack isn't strategic it's tactical. It was still a good move on one hand, a good counterattack can catch an enemy attacker off balance, kill a bunch of enemy, induce panic, screw with their future planning etc

But let's move beyond the tactical and consider the operational ramifications, those affecting the campaign itself in the Severodonetsk salient offensive. 

Is increasing the amount of defenders into the salient the smart move just to gain a small tactical victory to temporarily reclaim part of a city that holds almost no immediate tactical, operational, or strategic importance? 

Here are the real issues and what few are focusing on regarding this campaign. The Russians are doing broad front advance to reduce the salient, because that's what they do, but their most advantageous axes are those directed at the shoulders of the salient to cut it off at it's widest, trapping everyone inside in a large encirclement. 

That was the cornerstone of German operational theory in the 20th century, double envelopments to create encirclements, they called it Kesselschlacht, Cauldron Warfare, with every tactical and operational decision made to work toward large scale Cannae like battles to destroy the enemy armies to allow strategic outcomes. 

Salient reduction battles are perfect for this because they set the stage at the beginning of the battle where the enemy is already partly encircled, all the attacker needs to do is finish the encirclement and that's not done attacking the apex of the salient (Severodonetsk itself) and pushing the long way, it's attacks against the flanks. 

In this battle, the Russian northern pincer attack has largely failed due to terrain issues, rivers and high ground that Russian attacks can't get through. They've shifted it around a few times but haven't had any real success. But the southern pincer was only really directed from Popasna and that scored a breakthrough. 

There are two Ukraine Main Supply Routes (MSR) leading to Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. The primary one is T1302, and that's been effectively cut by observed fires by the northern axis of the Russian breakthrough from Popasna. West of that, exactly 10 kilometers away from the current Russian front line trace, is the T0513. If the Russians get close enough to cut that too then vehicle traffic moving to or from the salient is either off-roading or stopped. Not only does that mean supply trucks moving ammo and other supplies into the salient might not be able to, but anybody moving out is similarly burdened. That can mean casualties being evacuated but also retreating forces.

A good comparison of this campaign is the German Luttrich offensive in Normandy and the subsequent Falaise encirclement. Hitler and his inner circle were still cheering the advances they were making deeper into the salient while the US was increasingly flanking them and threatening to encircle them. Luckily for the Germans they made the decision to evacuate the salient at the same time the Allies made the decision not to quickly cut the salient, which allowed the vast majority of an entire German field army to escape to fight another day. Had the encirclement been closed when the Allies had the chance, the war in Europe likely would have ended before 1945. 

Will the Russian commander running the Popansa axis make the same mistake as Bradley and not press closing the encirclement? Or is his staff right now planning another breakthrough attempt at Soledar to cut the T0513? 

And what do the Ukrainians plan to do to stop it? It's obviously coming and yet they're focused on the least important place in the salient. Why are they reinforcing an area about to get cut off because they aren't reinforcing the area they desperately need to defend? Why are they counterattacking in Severodonetsk instead of the Popansa axis? 

I might be wrong, but unless things change a lot I think a nasty disaster is going to happen in the next week or two for this campaign. From the beginning of this offensive the one way the Ukrainians could screw this up was doing what they're doing now, trading lives for space and risking a large encirclement. 

In one sense if the Russians pull it off it still won't have strategic significance because UA losing 5-9k troops and the Severodonetsk Salient isn't decisive strategically.

But in another sense it's going to hurt long term. Ukraine troop morale plummets as will their confidence in their military leadership. A whole lot of equipment and manpower that could be used later is going to be lost. It's going to hurt the morale of their Ukrainian and foreign supporters too  who won't be able to make lemonade out of this. It'll make the Ukrainians look incompetent in the eyes of the world, especially at a time when they need positivity to balance out calls for a diplomatic solution that will favor Russia. It will make the Russians feel more confident, look more competent, and validate Putin's ""plan"" to shift focus to the Donbas.

This is electronic warfare, a critical but largely invisible aspect of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Military commanders largely shun discussing it, fearing they’ll jeopardize operations by revealing secrets.

Electronic warfare technology targets communications, navigation and guidance systems to locate, blind and deceive the enemy and direct lethal blows. It is used against artillery, fighter jets, cruise missiles, drones and more. Militaries also use it to protect their forces.

It’s an area where Russia was thought to have a clear advantage going into the war. Yet, for reasons not entirely clear, its much-touted electronic warfare prowess was barely seen in the war’s early stages in the chaotic failure to seize the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

It has become far more of a factor in fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine, where shorter, easier-to-defend supply lines let Russia move electronic warfare gear closer to the battlefield.

“They are jamming everything their systems can reach,” said an official of Aerorozvidka, a reconnaissance team of Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle tinkerers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns. “We can’t say they dominate, but they hinder us greatly.”

A Ukrainian intelligence official called the Russian threat “pretty severe” when it comes to disrupting reconnaissance efforts and commanders’ communications with troops. Russian jamming of GPS receivers on drones that Ukraine uses to locate the enemy and direct artillery fire is particularly intense “on the line of contact,” he said.

Ukraine has scored some successes in countering Russia’s electronic warfare efforts. It has captured important pieces of hardware — a significant intelligence coup — and destroyed at least two multi-vehicle mobile electronic warfare units.

Its own electronic warfare capability is hard to assess. Analysts say it has markedly improved since 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and instigated a separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine. But there are setbacks. Last week, Russia claimed it destroyed a Ukrainian electronic intelligence center in the southeastern town of Dniprovske. The claim could not be independently confirmed, and Ukrainian officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukraine has also made effective use of technology and intelligence from the United States and other NATO members. Such information helped Ukraine sink the battle cruiser Moskva. Allied satellites and surveillance aircraft help from nearby skies, as does billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite communications network.

Electronic war has three basic elements: probe, attack and protect. First, intelligence is gathered by locating enemy electronic signals. On attack, “white noise” jamming disables and degrades enemy systems, including radio and cellphone communications, air defense and artillery radars. Then there is spoofing, which confuses and deceives. When it works, munitions miss their targets.

“Operating on a modern battlefield without data is really hard,” **said retired Col. Laurie Buckhout, a former U.S. Army electronic warfare chief**. Jamming “can blind and deafen an aircraft very quickly and very dangerously, especially if you lose GPS and radar and you’re a jet flying at 600 miles an hour.”

All of which explains the secrecy around electronic warfare.

“It is an incredibly classified field because it is highly dependent on evolving, bleeding-edge technologies where gains can be copied and erased very quickly,” said **James Stidham, a communications security expert who has consulted for the U.S. State and Homeland Security departments.**

Ukraine learned hard lessons about electronic warfare in 2014 and 2015, when Russia overwhelmed its forces with it. The Russians knocked drones out of the sky and disabled warheads, penetrated cellphone networks for psychological ops and zeroed in on Ukrainian armor.

One Ukrainian officer told Christian Brose, an aide to the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., how Russian info warriors tricked a commander into returning a wireless call from his mother. When he did, they geolocated him in mid-call and killed him with precision rockets, Brose wrote in the book “The Kill Chain.”

The U.S. also experienced Russia’s electronic warfare in action in Syria, where the adversaries have backed opposing sides in the civil war. In 2018, **U.S. Special Operations chief Gen. Raymond Thomas** described how U.S. pilots’ communications were regularly “knocked down” in Syria in the “most aggressive” electronic warfare environment on the planet. Russia’s advanced systems are designed to blind U.S. Airborne Warning and Control Systems, or AWACS, aircraft — the eyes and ears of battlefield commanders — as well as cruise missiles and spy satellites.

In the current war, electronic warfare has become a furious theater of contention.

Aerorozvidka has modified camera-equipped drones to pinpoint enemy positions and drop mortars and grenades. Hacking is also used to poison or disable enemy electronics and collect intelligence.

Ukrainian officials say their electronic warfare capabilities have improved radically since 2015. They include the use of encrypted U.S and Turkish communications gear for a tactical edge. Ukraine has advanced so much it exports some of its technology.

Russia has engaged in GPS jamming in areas from Finland to the Black Sea, said **Lt. Col. Tyson Wetzel, an Air Force fellow at the Atlantic Council.** One regional Finnish carrier, Transaviabaltica, had to cancel flights on one route for a week as a result. Russian jamming has also disrupted Ukrainian television broadcasting, said **Frank Backes, an executive with California-based Kratos Defense,** which has satellite ground stations in the region.

Yet in the war’s early days, Russia’s use of electronic warfare was less effective and extensive than anticipated. That may have contributed to its failure to destroy enough radar and anti-aircraft units to gain air superiority.

Russia’s defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

Some analysts believe Russian commanders held back units fearing the units would be captured. At least two were seized. One was a Krasukha-4, which a U.S. Army database says is designed to jam satellite signals as well as surveillance radar and radar-guided weapons from more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) away. The other: the more advanced Borisoglebsk-2, which can jam drone guidance systems and radio-controlled land mines.

Russia may have also limited the use of electronic warfare early in the conflict because of concerns that ill-trained or poorly motivated technicians might not operate it properly.

“What we’re learning now is that the Russians eventually turned it off because it was interfering with their own communications so much,” said retired **Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former U.S. Army commander for Europe.**

The communications problems were evident with many Russian troops talking on insecure open radio channels, easily monitored by outsiders.

It’s unclear how much of an edge Russia’s electronic assets may now offer. Ukraine’s forces are now more concentrated than early in the war, which could make them easier to target.

Much depends on whether Russia’s battalion tactical groups “are configured in reality as they are on paper,” said **James Rands, of the Jane’s military intelligence think tank.** Each group, comprised of roughly 1,000 troops, is supposed to have an electronic warfare unit. The Pentagon says 110 such groups are in Ukraine.

The Kremlin also claims to have more than 1,000 small, versatile Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicles it uses for reconnaissance, targeting, jamming and cellphone interception.

Russia has lost about 50 of its Orlan-10s in the war, but “whatever they lost could be a small portion of what’s flying,” said researcher **Samuel Bendett, of the Center for Naval Analyses think tank.**

Ukraine’s relative UAV strength is unclear, but Ukrainians have adapted such technologies as software-defined radio and 3D printing to stay nimble.

The U.S. and Britain also supply jamming gear, but how much it helps is unclear. Neither country has offered details. The ability of both sides to disable the other’s drones is crucial with the artillery they scout now so decisive in battles.

Musk’s Starlink is a proven asset. Its more than 2,200 low-orbiting satellites provide broadband internet to more than 150,000 Ukrainian ground stations. Severing those connections is a challenge for Russia. It is far more difficult to jam low-earth orbiting satellites than geostationary ones.

Musk has won plaudits from the Pentagon for at least temporarily defeating Russian jamming of Ukrainian satellite uplinks with a quick software fix. But he has warned Ukrainians to keep those terminals powered down when possible — they are vulnerable to geolocation — and recently worried on Twitter about redoubled Russian interference efforts.

“I’m sure that the Russians are getting smarter about that now,” said Wetzel, the Air Force lieutenant colonel.

""Complexity"" is sort of a nebulous term. Let me try to give an example of why open field fighting is more complex though. 

Hand an untrained soldier a rifle, two grenades and a standard uniform. Now place him in an area of endless farm fields with tree-lines ever mile or so. Now compare this to the same soldier in a city. 

Which one do you think is going to have more success in killing an enemy soldier attacking his location? The reason why open field fighting is more complex is it requires new tools, and new strategies. 

That soldier will likely need to be on a team trained with Javelins, drones, have some level of integrated support with the Ukrainian Air Force and surely have to be able to work with artillery support to have success.

[Here is an article from Robert Scales Jr, a retired United States Army major general and former commandant of the U.S. Army War College,  I'll pull some quotes out. PDF Warning](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=451579)

&gt;These enemies
learned with each combat encounter that the surest
way to gain advantage is to negate American bigwar technologies by moving the fight into complex
terrain such as jungles, mountains, and most recently,
cities. The enemy’s plan is simple and effective: lure
American forces into terrain where Information-Age
knowledge, speed, and precision give way to the
more traditional warfighting advantages of mass, will,
patience, and the willingness to die.

&gt;A city is the greatest challenge to any tactical
force. In cities the red zone—the space separating
friendly from enemy forces—compresses. The zone
is often thousands of meters in open battle, but only
tens of meters in the urban maze of densely aggregated buildings, streets, and back alleys. The traditional advantages of fighting outside the red zone disappear as cities compel soldiers to fight the enemy
close. The compartmented nature of the urban jungle
fragments forces. Short lines of sight limit the effective ranges of organic weapons and allow the
enemy to “hug” U.S. forces, obviating the effective
use of precision-guided weapons launched from
aerial platforms. Compartmented urban terrain lessens to a significant degree the advantages of superior situational awareness and electronic-communications dominance.

Basically anytime you have a training, manpower or technology advantage you want to be in a location that negates the enemies advantage of those three. Urban areas do this for Ukraine. 

Whole tactical units would still likely be best used in urban defense than in any other location. Note they do group forests, jungles and urban areas together as location best suited to negate enemy advantages.",6b2f1774de782f3afd2f37923c53adbef6a7503e,True,False,,,,,0,1654363167,,0,{},ib5wnop,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib5us3u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib5wnop/,1654363182,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654334367.0

Localized strength =/= broad force strength

Regardless of the broad force strength, counterattacking within urban areas is by far the best bet for Ukraine in general. Ukraine still suffers a pretty big tech advantage in open field fighting, so counterattacking in urban areas is likely a best bet for Ukraine to inflict damage and cause Russia to reinforce the city thus pulling forces from other more advantageous locations for Russia to attack from. 

&gt;However reports seem to also indicate the foreign legion is at the front of the attack, which I wouldn't expect if the core UAF was still in good shape. 

Urban fighting is also where the Foreign Legion would likely have the most success. I doubt the UAF wants the foreign legion holding open fields against more structured Russian forces. 

If you handed me a battalion of troops coming from a dozen or so different countries with tons of different training experience and asked me where I would trust them the most to have an effect, it would be in urban combat where they could counterattack over-extended Russians then take advantage of the 3-1 advantage you get from defense. 

Even poorly trained defenders can cause a lot of damage in urban warfare, but I wouldn't want them holding the flank of open fighting if I was the UAF.",e9387bd9e40bb906da9874c3408c7bd91bd297db,True,False,,,,,0,1654360601,,0,{},ib5rr19,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib5qt0b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib5rr19/,1654360616,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654331801.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Nope, you're right. WW3 was fully expected to go nuclear, the question always was what would the ground troops contribute. 

For much of the Cold War, the US Army were themselves going to assist in nuclear war using tactical nuclear weapons, some by surface to surface missiles but most by artillery. Even 1980s era warplans were filled with doctrinal use of a shit ton of W48 155mm nuclear artillery rounds with .07 kt blast yields to hit Warsaw Pact armor formations with. In fact the US only got rid of its tactical nukes because Army top brass hated the post Cold War hassle that came with security and maintenance of them. You should read what generals like Colin Powell (who had a large part in the decision) felt about them. In so many words, ""meh. Let the Air Force do it, they like nukes anyway.""

All that said, the USAF got the bulk of funding during the Cold War (and still does) because they were the main effort. Not because air superiority but because they controlled nuclear missiles and bombers that would be who won the war (assuming nuclear wars can be won, which was much debated during the Cold War by both sides). 

When it comes to Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union in particular, they were fully gungho about massive ground invasions in concert with nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare, which was why they went fully mechanized/motorized in the 60s, because all those APCs, IFV, tanks, etc were NBC sealed (though cargo trucks weren't, but that's a different story). They too fully intended to use tactical nukes as well as absolutely loads of chemical weapons and likely bio too, as well as strategic nukes, because there was no way that as central and western Europe was going up in nuclear fire that nobody was going to launch a ballistic missile, especially since France outright said that even if nukes weren't used that if Soviet troops came near the Rhine they were going to use nukes to kill them.

Postwar events meant about 20 years with the US not seriously considering Russia it's strategic enemy anymore, we downsized heavily as a result, lost A LOT of capabilities, but nothing has changed as both of us still have enough nukes and delivery platforms aimed at each other. So we're back to the nasty reality that US and Russia in particular have loaded guns pointed at each other's heads 24/7 in a perpetual Mexican Standoff. 

The biggest difference now for the US, besides a lack of tactical nukes and too few overall to perform a counterforce nuclear option is the lack of US ground forces forward deployed in EUCOM, along with any way to get more over rapidly (modern REFORGER). Back in the Cold War, we had two large and fully mechanized corps, each of 3-4 divisions, and each of those possessing what we'd now call an armored brigade. And they only represented half or less of what we planned to use, they were the speed bump to slow a Warsaw Pact ground assault until the rest arrived. 

Now the US Army has 3-4 brigades stationed in Europe, only 1-2 of which are armored BCTs. We have enough forward staged equipment to have manpower flown over to stand up 1-2 more ABCTs. And we have the means to ""rapidly"" (within a month) move another ~3-4 ABCTs. To put that in perspective, Ukraine has 18 equivalent mech, armored, or tank brigades. Ours are better, but numbers still matter. 

All of that points that the current mission over there is not warfighting focused, it's a A2AD deterrence to protect Eastern Europe. If that war starts, which it can't be allowed (hence stationing US troops on the border) then there is absolutely no telling how bad it'll get. With the likelihood that only ground units pounding on each other conventionally without nukes being slightly more likely then they all resort to Brazilian Ju Jitsu to decide the conflict.",29fc4d4f4f6fd6905d71d510e77aeee369397e69,True,False,,,,,0,1654359621,,0,{},ib5pvox,False,t3_v3fq3g,False,True,t1_ib0xc5g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3fq3g/long_live_the_king_of_battle_the_return_to/ib5pvox/,1654359640,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654330821.0

The purpose of the American MLRS systems, from what I can tell, is mostly artillery suppression - a drone or artillery radar spots a piece of enemy artillery, you fire one GPS guided missile that lands exactly on it, then you do it another 5-11 times depending on which launcher you have, then you reload. This should make Russian artillery fire less, both because they're getting destroyed and because they spend more time running away after they shoot.",b02e012c7b66579e83a9ab456bbe920704215b60,True,False,,,,,0,1654358823,,0,{},ib5od51,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t1_ib5m2zz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib5od51/,1654358841,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654330023.0

In a game world, probably, but ammo would be an issue there as well.

In reality (and I am trying to quote a friend here he served in 2 different conflicts) its not just that you dont know where the enemies are but you often not sure where your allies are and sometimes you have no idea where you are.

I would say that defending with the new long range MLRS would be indeed significantly easier as any attack that would need artillery support would be meeting counter battery fire from ranges they cannot contend with. There is still the possibility to shoot and gtfo but that seriously reduce capabilities and still put them in some danger.

Counterpushing can be a bit more iffy, since russians could lay traps (both infantry, mechanized or presighted artillery fire etc when these systems are on the move) use long range missles (kalibr? cruise missles...) air strikes and so on. It is very rare to have perfect recon on your side.

That leaves stealing Western tech as the only realistic plan for maintaining near-peer adversary status from a tech standpoint, and even if we weren’t actively blockading such maneuvers, it takes a decade plus to reorient existing domestic production (for things like chips and and computers) to be at a competitive level with existing foreign producers (like TSM or IBM) and it also takes a metric fuck ton of money. China has been dumping money into such industries for so long without positive margins that they’re now basically made of debt and can’t afford to pump a bunch of money into anything else. They especially can’t afford to use all that capital when food and fuel prices are continuing to rise, and they’re the worlds largest importer of both. They are already defaulting in their lifeblood industries (Evergrande et al.). Their debt model is failing in the next 5 years. If they attempt to to fund these ventures to maintain near-peer status, more of their people will starve besides the 500million population deficit they’re already expecting by 2050. It will be an incredibly turbulent time in the People’s Republic, and whether they come out better or worse for all this remains to be seen. But the idea that China will be able to maintain it’s current status as the world economic/tech leader is simply not feasible anymore.

In military terms, China’s force contraction will be felt much harsher because it is still transitioning from a large-scale manpower army to an advanced info-suite based one, whereas most/all Western militaries have long been light on men and heavy on info and material. Such an army is also quite expensive, but the West already has budget taken out for it, whereas China is in the same situation of increase military spending or buy food reserves (especially since their domestic farming is getting hammered bc of fertilizer shortages from Russia).

Are we to believe that the USAF won't get involved? Okay let's say they do. Does the USAF exist only to do CAS in a Near Peer War? Are we to believe that they won't follow doctrine and attack deep targets inside Russia? 

What are the ramifications for deep strikes into Russian territory? Does Putin stand up, slow clap, praise American audacity, and end the war? Or does he retaliate in kind? What is Russian nuclear policy for even conventional attacks to their country? What is threat of tit-for-tat escalation of strategic attacks? What comes next? More so  what can you guarantee won't happen next?

Likewise, are we to believe that before the USAF responds with doctrinal deep strikes against that Russia won't already have conducted strategic targets beyond the main line of resistance against NATO countries when the war started? That the very stuff they did in Ukraine (while limited) they'd not do fighting NATO? 

And after they do it, do NATO leaders refuse to respond in kind for fear of escalation, showing weakness and proving they won't do what's necessary to win? If you believe that, show your work by using both psych profiling of key leaders to show they'd fold, as well as recent historical examples.

Since all of the above indicate the very real dangers of strategic escalation that could and would likely lead to nuclear war, what does that say to going into the conflict with the naive approach to wait for the enemy to use nukes first? More so, does there exist an alternative to that, a nuclear strategy that if one believes they are going to enter a war with an enemy and nukes will likely be used, just to skip painful tit-for-tat and start with nukes? Oh yeah, that's called First Strike, still remaining a US nuclear option. Well, so much for that...

Because if we are talking about the individual states, well its a bloody mess.  


Now for the EU as a single entity things aren't easy to explain, so lets set up the long term Goal of the EU, which is to create a proper state capable of being considered a superpower in its own right and not an agglomerate of countries under the general direction of the US.  


Now can the accession of Ukraine in the medium term help in reaching that goal?, yes, but under certain circumstances.  


Will the Ukrainian prevalent sentiment after the war be: ""We are Europeans that have fought against the foreign invaders"", or"" are we Ukrainians that fought against a foreign government that wanted to rule us""?  
For now the both of those idea go hand in hand in accomplishing the immediate objective which is to repel the invaders, but after the war everything will change, the first sentiment would allow for a pan-European entity to subtract some sovereignty to the Ukrainian state, the second would be fiercely opposed to this.  
The objective of the EU is to make the first idea to prevail, so the EU will show as much as it can to be close to Ukraine, help her fight the war, help her rebuild, etc.  


In the short term nothing is decided yet, one could point to things that favor one outcome or the other but reality is that everything could change in the 10/15 that it will take Ukraine to be ready for EU accession.

I think they are not being honest with some of the prices that they think were 3 months ago. First of all, in Russia vegetables are ripe in August and this is the month when they are the cheapest. Current vegetables in stores were grown in 2021. The 'before' prices for apples and especially for potatoes they mention are mostly valid for August. It's a normal seasonality.

Another thing: the food they show is still fairly cheap. With pre-war currency exchange rate apples are for €1.5, potatoes for €1, milk for €1.1, sugar for €0.9. Keep in mind that the store they show is in Moscow, one of the most expensive cities in Russia. It's also a separate story for every item. For example sugar got more expensive simply because of high demand when people panicked, it will get cheaper. Sugar is produced in Russia and there is plenty of it. Here is another point: Russia has been obsessed with food security for long. Almost every basic food item you see in this video is made in Russia. And also in 2014 Russian counter-sanctions banned most of the European food, no more Polish apples or Finnish and Estonian cheese. Because food security is important, Russian food sector is really independent.

When it comes to my experience, I recently bought apples for 100, milk for 90 and there are cheaper options available for every item. I don't see anything like x2 prices. Look, even x2 prices could look really bad on paper, but if it went from €0.5 to €1 it's not that bad. 2022 inflation is expected to be around +20% which is *not great, not terrible*. This is a motto that perfectly encapsulates Russian life for the past decades. After USSR collapse Russians survived 1998 crisis, 2008 crisis, COVID economic crisis in 2020, and will survive 2022 crisis too. Russians are used to inflation and being poor.

[],False,,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,"&gt;I never claimed that they did not have less artillery. In my own quote, I stated ""despite having more artillery"" I'm claiming that what Ukraine is receiving is equal if not better in quality to Russian artillery, and are being sent a continually growing supply.

When you say ""despite"" numerical inferiority, Ukrainian artillery ""may"" be of better quality, the typical assumption will be ""thus the balance of combat power between Russian and Ukrainian artillery may be equal in the end"". Let's say I have 3 times the numerical superiority to you, by Lancaster's square law of projectile combat, I have a 3^2 =9 superiority in firepower to you and in an exchange, everything else being equal, I am expected to take 1/9 your casualties. In order to achieve a parity, your units need to be either 9 times more accurate and lethal with every shot, or being 9 times harder to be hit. BTW, that's the typical scenario between attackers and defenders: defenders are assumed to have about 9-10 times lesser chance of being hit; so they can defeat an attacking force of the same size while taking 1/9 of the casualty, or the attackers need to have 3 times the superiority in numbers in order to achieve a parity in kill/loss.

So, are you claiming that ""thus the balance of combat power between Russian and Ukrainian artillery may be equal in the end"".? What is the correlation of force between Russian and Ukrainian artillery? How many rounds each side are firing per day? How much better Ukrainian artillery are compared to Russian ones, on a tube by tube basis? We need to know those numbers to actually make an educated guess. I've seen claims (unsubstantied) that Russians are firing 600,000 rounds of artillery per day. That sounds like a lot, but Phil Karber (in one of these 2 presentations https://youtu.be/XDf0DynwIN0 https://youtu.be/4tX9q9JhCW8) mentioned that the rate of ammo consumption in 2014 was 400 rounds/tube/day. WWII, US Army was ~100, 1973 Yom Kipur was 200. At 110 BTGs, 6-8 guns per BTG, the low ball estimate is 200,000 rounds/day. The 200,000 rounds of 155 that Biden promised is essentially what the Russians may fire per day, or for breakfast. 

If you are not making that claim ""thus the balance of combat power between Russian and Ukrainian artillery may be equal in the end"", but rather, ""Ukrainian artillery is more efficient on a per tube basis"", my next question is ""by how much? 25%? 50%? 100%?"" and ""so what?"". What difference does that make in the context of correlation of forces, ammunition availability, and total available combat power? If I just take the expression of ""we fire one and they shoot back at us with 10"" from WaPo article literally, then the Ukrainians are fighting against 100 times firepower superiority. To break even, each Ukrainian tube needs to be 100 times better, which is ... impossible. Otherwise, your claim of ""may be they are 50% better"" may be technically correct but in a vacuum of context, it means very little.

&gt;This may be a simple misunderstanding and if that's the case I apologize, however, if you are in some way suggesting that Ukraine is comparable to or even worse than the Vietcong then I'm going to have to severely disagree with you. The mere suggestion of this comparison is laughable to me and seems like the type of argument made either in bad faith, ignorance, or delusion. If this isn't a misunderstanding Ill assume ignorance, you seem smart. But if it is a misunderstanding then I apologize and please disregard this section of my response.

That's just bollocks. What I wrote was specifically in response to the  thinking that hugging the enemy denies them their use of fire support. That's only somewhat true and I lay out the precise reason why. The fire support is *less* effective, but the side with inferior in artillery *combat power* (which is numerical *and* qualitative difference quantified), will still suffer more. From WaPo, it doesn't seem like the Ukrainians could even get to ""hug"" the Russians and nobody could provide *quantitative* outline of exactly what is the relative artillery combat power each side is generating. By the virtue of Russia slow but steady advance, they are having greater combat power.",403495da164751485e7df76cf5feeebf85a2fbcd,True,False,,,,,0,1654344453,,0,{},ib50tm8,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t1_ib4th6f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib50tm8/,1654344468,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654315653.0

What absolutely nobody foresaw, was that Switzerland might find itself in a situation where exporting weapons would be the *moral* thing to do.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/04/ukraine-east-artillery-war/

&gt;“Russian artillery is shooting from morning until evening,” said Volodymyr Pohorilyy, 43, intelligence commander of the Dnipro-1 battalion, which holds several key positions in the region. “If our side shoots one their way, we get 10 or 15 back.”

&gt;On Thursday afternoon, Ukrainian soldiers said the four rounds of artillery that struck their position appeared consistent with cluster munitions. Such weapons are banned under an international treaty because of their ability to inflict indiscriminate damage in populated areas or leave behind unexploded ordnance as they spray “bomblets” over a wide area. Neither Ukraine nor Russia is a signatory to the treaty.

I know they can't help it but wrote that last line, but they should also add: the USA and China.

&gt;“We need help,” Pohorilyy said. “If it was foot soldiers against foot soldiers we could do something about it. But they’re 10 kilometers away, just throwing bombs at us.”

&gt;Sometimes, he said, they would be patched up and then head right back out to fight. The wounds were almost entirely from long-distance shelling.

&gt;“We haven’t seen the enemy in the eyes a lot,” he said.

&gt;“They’re in hell,” Bereza called out from across the room.

&gt;The Russians are “firing everything at them,” Bazulin said of his troops in Zolote. “We don’t always understand where they’re shooting from.”

&gt;Even after they come under intense shelling, he said, they are sometimes left with no option but to stay put and risk being hit again.

&gt;“I can’t go left or right because then I’ll have an empty space,” he said. “I can’t go forward because there are Russians there. I can’t go backward because then I’d be pulling back.”

&gt;Given the performance in Ukraine I can't imagine China would be remotely interested in having Russians tag along on any war it plans to start.  


It might or it might not, depending on the circumstances. To quote Michael Kofman, Russia's current (counter)performance is context-specific. Besides, having Russia as a force in being tying down Western resources in Europe is in itself beneficial.

I'd say it's gonna be somewhere between those two frameworks. Obviously China will be the stronger partner, but Russia will remain sufficiently critical to China's security for the foreseeable future that China will always have to keep its interests into account.

&gt;And not a single part of this discussion is about what is happening right now, its about the long term prospects beyond only the current strategic focus on defensively stopping the Russian's offensive ability. Its about what happens after that and weighing options other than bullshit propaganda slogans and possibly unrealistic expectations

Exactly, what happens after the west proves to be unable and unwilling to do as much as support a strategically favorable war, a morally justified one too? Instead of isolating and curbing Russian influence across the world, the west will do so to itself. It's self harm. 

What country would be able and willing to rely on partnership with the west outside of NATO? How much will this increase the likelihood of a Chine invasion of Taiwan and a final collapse of the western dominated world order? How much more will it cause the Asian partners like S.Korea, Vietnam and Philippians to drift into Chinese vassalage as that will remain their only option for survival.

The west can afford to ""lose"" the war in Ukraine. It cannot afford to lose that war due to ineptitude, divisions between countries, unwillingness to pursue strategic objective and paralysis.

&gt;What is the legitimate likelihood of a successful nationwide counteroffensive?

Pretty high if the west commits to supporting Ukraine in earnest. Yes billions are spent, but you cannot possibly argue that the west (or even the US specifically) operates under a purpose for a Ukrainian victory. In fact the west doesn't seem to have any coherent strategy, 3.5 months into the war and what 8 months into the crisis? It's monthy pythonesque comedy. 

The particulars are not simple questions and neither are the answers, but they are not relevant, because the west is not able to take an answer and stick to it if the answer is anything other than a refusal to commit.

&gt;And the wave of optimism following the Kyiv retreat are settling down, the reality of a long nasty war with nasty global effects are setting in, and morale is suffering.

All of this is very predictable, in fact I've been posting a lengthy posts (including in discussions with you), how this is going to be heading for a long war, how the conditions in the east will be much more favorable to Russia, how Russian strategy and tactics will adapt as they have (the only logical and most likely outcome). I'm not some genius, this all very simple and standard lines that must have been understood among military decision makers in the west. But nothing significant enough was done to prepare and act upon these realities.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"Well, yes, obviously they have been in retreat in the area for a few days. The question is whether it is a controlled withdrawal or a rout. 

In this case, the Ukrainians are fighting a defense in depth, which is essentially one long chain of fighting withdrawals. Withdrawal is considered one of the riskiest maneuvers for any military because it requires so much discipline to execute in good order without tipping into an actual rout. Even under the best of circumstances can be difficult to distinguish orderly fighting withdrawals from headlong, uncontrolled retreat. In no small part because the withdrawing army has an incentive to feign actual panicked retreat to draw the enemy into overextending and to maintain the element of surprise when counterattacking. If you think you just kicked the other side's ass so hard that they completely broke and ran away, you're more likely to let your guard down as you enter a suddenly peaceful area for the first time in a long time. 

Whether they cleverly plotted out a feigned retreat or simply opportunistically exploited a sudden opportunity isn't really that important. Although I will say feigned retreats are a super common tactic, so it really isn't out of the realm of possibility that it really was intentional, even if that is less likely than a forced retreat. More importantly, the fact that they were in a position to take advantage of the Russian complacency at all shows that they are in an orderly retreat. 

- Their troops were able to withdraw across the river in good order after breaking contact with the enemy. So without continuing to fight as they moved through the city. In a rout, the enemy tends to be following hard on the retreating army's heels in an effort to inflict maximum casualties, unless they are incompetent or exhausted themselves. So we can safely assume either it wasn't a rout or the Russians were too incompetent or exhausted to exploit the withdrawal, or all of the above.  
- Following this withdrawal, the Ukrainians continued to monitor the areas they had withdrawn from, and were able to identify an opportunity to counterattack.
- The Ukrainians immediately exploited that opportunity either with some well-positioned reserves or by turning around the retreating units themselves (less likely if they were routed and/or it wasn't a feigned retreat, because then they would need time to reset). In either case, the Ukrainian forces as a whole are exhibiting excellent discipline, battlefield awareness, and tactical flexibility. That implies solid command and control, which is impressive during such a challenging series of maneuvers conducted under grueling conditions. 

In the end, it's almost inevitable that some percentage of units will be forced into a disorganized retreat during a long term defense in depth. The key is to plan for failure, with well-placed fallback positions and reserves. 

In this case, they're probably doing OK so long as they keep any routs localized and reestablish a defensive line quickly enough to prevent any breakouts or flanking maneuvers against other Ukrainian units. That meets their objective of buying time for resources from the west to come into play. They're doing better than OK if they meet their secondary objective of inflicting disproportionate casualties on the Russians while withdrawing, which this counterattack seems to have helped achieve.  

All of which indicates that it probably isn't a collapsing front in the sense that you seem to mean it. Which isn't to say everything looks peachy for the Ukrainians, or that local routs aren't happening. Conditions are clearly desperate, and it would of course be much better if the Russians were literally incapable of making any progress whatsoever anywhere at all. But even with the Russians applying the maximum amount of pressure they can muster into the smallest area possible, the Ukrainians bearing the brunt of that pressure seem to still be fighting a cool-headed, careful battle of attrition.",fa812493a58914ab430e4f290ddb39025b42eef0,True,False,,,,,0,1654318502,,0,{},ib491qc,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t1_ib3l0mm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib491qc/,1654318512,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654289702.0

China most definitely doesn't. China wants to (1) absorb Taiwan, (2) remove U.S. presence from the Asia-Pacific and (3) establish regional hegemony without outright territorial conquest, save for the aforementioned case of Taiwan as well as various ECS/SCS islands.

In effect, China wants to execute its own version of the Monroe Doctrine.

Agreed.

Russian forces conducted unsuccessful assaults southeast and southwest of Izyum and west of Lyman but remain unlikely to secure major advances towards Slovyansk.

Russian forces made minor gains in the eastern part of Severodonetsk, but Ukrainian forces continues to launch localized counterattacks in Severodonetsk and its outskirts.

Russian forces did not attempt to launch assaults on Avdiivka.

Russian forces failed to regain lost positions in northeastern Kherson Oblast and continued to defend previously occupied positions.

Russian occupation authorities began issuing Russian passports in Kherson City and Melitopol, though they continue to face challenges establishing societal control over occupied territories and ending Ukrainian partisan actions.",21aab472c37e8068186601dbb423130ca308554b,True,False,,,,,0,1654314820,,0,{},ib43ybe,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t3_v3xszf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib43ybe/,1654314830,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654286020.0

Introduction

Russia has failed to achieve most of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor military planning, significant logistical problems, low combat readiness, and other deficiencies, which undermined Russian military effectiveness. These and other challenges—including Ukrainian military efforts and Western aid—severely impacted Russian air, ground, cyber, and maritime operations. 

Russia’s failures will force the Russian military to fundamentally rethink its training practices, organizational structure, culture, logistics, recruitment and retention policies, and planning efforts. Nevertheless, Russia is still attempting a de facto annexation of parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that it controls.

————————

&gt; * This analysis examines lessons from Russian air, ground, cyber, and other domains following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It asks:

* What are some of the most important military lessons from the first three months of the war? 

* What do these lessons suggest about the future of the war? 

&gt; * The assessment focuses predominantly on the operational level of warfare, especially the planning and conduct of the military campaign.1 The operational level links the tactical utilization of forces to strategic objectives and includes such aspects as fire and maneuver, logistics, intelligence, command and control, and planning.2

&gt; * Three weeks into the war, for example, the Russian air force began to run low on precision-guided munitions, such as laser- and satellite-guided bombs, which caused the Russians to use a growing number of unguided artillery shells, rockets, and missiles from the ground forces.

&gt; * For example, the 9M729 cruise missile, which is fired from the Iskander-K short-range ballistic missile system, is one of the Russian military’s most advanced weapons systems with precision-strike capabilities.22 The cruise missile has roughly a half dozen socket attachment points that permit data to move through the heat shield. Some of these socket attachment points were manufactured by U.S. companies. In addition, the rails that affixed the circuit boards to the computer housing—as well as the circuit boards—were manufactured by U.S. companies.

&gt; * The 9M949 300 mm rocket, which is used in Russia’s Tornado-S multiple rocket launcher system, also used a fiber-optic gyroscope manufactured in the United States. 

&gt; * Finally, the Russian TOR-M2 air-defense system utilized an oscillator designed in the United Kingdom, which is located in the computer that controls the radar.

&gt; * The result in theory is a fairly self‑sufficient ground combat unit with fire and rear support.25 In practice, the BTGs were likely understrength and lacked sufficient infantry.

&gt; * Russia’s approach to combined arms warfare was generally to hammer Ukrainian positions with artillery and other stand-off weapons and then to send armored vehicles forward on a maneuver termed “reconnaissance to contact,” designed to overwhelm what remained of Ukrainian defensive lines.

&gt; * The Russian army also operated with fewer support soldiers than many other militaries. Roughly 150 of the troops in a BTG could be considered support, which is notably lower than some militaries such as the U.S. Army, which deploys approximately 10 support soldiers for every combat soldier.

&gt; * Bans by the West on the export of sensitive technologies to Russia could also cut into Moscow’s ability to prosecute a protracted ground war. Two of Russia’s largest tank manufactures, for example, were forced to halt production because of a lack of parts.32

&gt; * Second, the Russian invasion force was far too small to seize and hold territory, particularly with a Ukrainian population that rose up against the Russian military in a variation of what the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong referred to as a “people’s war.” As Mao wrote in his book On Protracted War, “the richest source of power to wage war lies in the masses of the people.” Mao argued that in a well-organized resistance effort, the invading force “will be surrounded by hundreds of millions of our people standing upright . . . and he will be burned to death.”

&gt; * Russia utilized between 150,000 and 190,000 soldiers—including regular and irregular forces—for the initial invasion of Ukraine, a country of approximately 44 million people with an area of over 600,000 square kilometers.34 Those numbers translate into a force ratio of 4 Russian soldiers per 1,000 Ukrainian inhabitants.

&gt; * There are no exact formulas for how many soldiers are required to hold conquered territory, but a force ratio of as many as 20 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants has sometimes been necessary to pacify a hostile local population.

&gt; * Large numbers of troops are generally essential to establish basic law and order. By the end of World War II, for example, there were 101 U.S. soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in the U.S.-controlled sector of Germany. More recently, there were 19 U.S. and European soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in Bosnia in 1995 and 20 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants in Kosovo in 2000.36

&gt; * Lower ratios are generally insufficient to pacify hostile populations. In Iraq, for instance, the United States had 7 soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants and faced a persistent deadly insurgency—even with the help of Iraqi government forces and Sunni militia members. U.S. Army chief of staff General Eric K. Shinseki warned Congress in February 2003 that “several hundred thousand” troops would likely be needed to secure postwar Iraq.37 In Afghanistan, the United States had only 1 soldier per 1,000 inhabitants, along with the help of Afghan National Security Forces.

&gt; * Russia’s challenges raised serious questions about its competence in fire and maneuver. For example, where were the Russian infantry that were supposed to target Ukrainian ambushes? Where was the fire from artillery, mortars, and close air support that was supposed to suppress Ukrainian anti-tank guided munitions?42

&gt; * Ukrainian attacks during Russia’s initial advance also made the Russians unwilling to push sensitive electronic warfare and air-defense systems into Ukraine in case they were captured. Consequently, Russia had to back off on its electronic suppression of Ukrainian radar and communications. 

&gt; * Over the first month and a half of the war, more than 40 percent of Russia’s destructive cyberattacks were aimed at Ukrainian critical infrastructure sectors, while another 32 percent targeted Ukrainian government sites.

&gt; * Over the previous few years, Russia had invested heavily in electronic warfare systems capable of shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum. This capability is grouped under the concept of the Radio Electronic Battery.49 In the early morning of February 24, 2022, for example, Russia jammed Ukrainian air defense radar across all frequency bands. Russian E95M UAVs, which simulated Russian aircraft, harassed Ukrainian radar to draw out their air defenses.50

&gt; *  Some Western governments, including U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, provided help to the Ukrainian government.

&gt; * Private sector firms also responded. Microsoft worked closely with the Ukrainian government and cybersecurity staff from other governments and private companies…

&gt; * However, Russia will likely make some adjustments over the course of the war, including improving logistics. For example, Russia’s decision during the second phase of the war to regroup along a southern and eastern front improved Russian lines of communication.

&gt; * But winning back territory will be difficult for Ukraine. As Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c highlight at Kherson Air Base near Crimea, Russian forces have become entrenched in Ukraine with main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, electronic warfare systems, multiple rocket launchers, armored fighting vehicles, sophisticated air defense systems, and other systems. Russia has also constructed defensive fighting positions to make it difficult for Ukraine to counterattack.

&gt; * If the United States and the West want to shift the balance of power in Ukraine’s favor, they will need to provide Ukraine with more weapons and platforms that allow the Ukrainian military to conduct offensive operations and more effective counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces over a sustained period.

&gt; * More advanced weapons and platforms will be critical to overrun entrenched Russian forces.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And not a single part of this discussion is about what is happening right now,

Neither belligerent in this war have the militarily abilities to achieve a decisive strategic victory that would be needed to defeat its opponent quickly and soundly. Ukraine its too weak despite mobilization, and the West already made it clear they wont provide the weapons to do do it through imported firepower. While Russia's ground forces are too weak now thanks to the bloody phase 1, they're unwilling to mobilize, and can't escalate with more destructive strategic weapons without possibly bringing NATO into it, meaning WW3. So the alternative means a long, blood war of attrition and willpower, trying to outlast the opponents. 

Right now, public opinion in Ukraine points that they wont capitulate. Great, more power to them. But public opinion in Russia points that they wont capitulate either. And both might be telling the truth. So this could end up a long and costly war of undetermined length. Hence the ""Forever War.""

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,[],,,,text,t2_dg31a,False,False,"&gt; Washington (CNN) Staring down the prospect of an extended stalemate in Ukraine, the US and its allies are placing a renewed emphasis on the need for a negotiated settlement to end the war as the conflict grinds into its 100th day with no clear victory in sight for either side.  

&gt; US officials have in recent weeks been meeting regularly with their British and European counterparts to discuss potential frameworks for a ceasefire and for ending the war through a negotiated settlement, multiple sources familiar with the talks told CNN. Among the topics has been a four-point framework proposed by Italy late last month. That framework involves Ukraine committing to neutrality with regard to NATO in exchange for some security guarantees, and negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on the future of Crimea and the Donbas region.  

&gt; Ukraine is not directly involved in those discussions, despite the US commitment to ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine."" US and Ukrainian officials said the US has not been pressuring Ukraine to commit to a certain plan or directly pushing them to sit down with the Russians.
&gt;   

&gt; Still, there is some confusion about what kind of framework the US would consider appropriate to bring to the Ukrainians for further discussion.
&gt;   

&gt; US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters earlier this week that the Italian framework is ""one of those initiatives that we certainly would love to see bring a conclusion to this horrific war and the horrific attacks on the Ukrainian people."" But two US officials told CNN that the US actually does not support the Italian proposal.  

&gt; In any case, US and western officials tell CNN that there is a growing concern that if the Russians and Ukrainians don't get back to the table and work out a deal, the war will drag on -- potentially for years.

I never claimed to be either. Nor did I even attempt that. Nor did I say shit about Putin saving face. I addressed someone claiming Americans have zero say in the outcome of the war in Ukraine, which is outright nonsense for the reasons above I stated. 

This is a proxy war. Yep, Ukrainians are bleeding. But that is how proxy wars work, they are the proxies so they do the dying. We support them so they can die and fight in our place, because we can't/wont. But the proxy relies on the patron for support. How much they rely is in direct relation to how much power the patrons have. Since Ukraine is UTTERLY dependent on the West, the West controls this proxy war. Not only do we have a say, we have a bigger say than Zelensky does. And when I say ""we"", that means a whole less about Poland and more about the more powerful countries in Europe and the US, whose support is necessary because once it becomes common place to bail on Ukraine, more will follow, and that will likely include the US too, where there is no guarantee at all it will continuously support Ukraine for a long brutal war of attrition to retake its land instead of a nice quick peace deal that ends it so life can go back to normal.
