This isn't accurate, and I'm kinda bored with this widespread mischaracterisation of what happened. 

It says that he almost certainly approved an operation to ***capture** or kill* khashoggi.

Any rational assessment is that is was a kidnap attempt gone wrong and then covered up in a moronic fashion by the extraction team. If anyone thinks a government assassinates someone by using long-winded tactics to lure then into their own embassy whilst their partner is waiting outside... Then I have a bridge to sell them.

Khashoggi was an ex saudi intelligence agent and posed a national security threat (in their view). They have a long history of extracting targets under the guise of 'medical evacuations'. According to the audio 'conveniently' leaked by Turkey, there was a struggle and something went wrong. Given he was there to get a marriage permit and his fiancee was outside I'm guessing the team panicked and went about disposing of the body in a hamfisted way.

Also worth noting that the family have formally forgiven the saudi government which issued a full public apology (with some significant blood money thrown in).

In Washington, energy, and specifically oil, takes precedence over humanitarian concerns.  That's the rule, not the exception.  It's constant no matter which ""party"" is in control of the White House.

Not trading with these countries won't make them more democratic, it will just turn them into another North Korea or a totalitarian Islamic state for those in the middle east (which Saudi Arabia already is, but making it poor wouldn't turn it more democratic, it would make it worse and even reverse the later reforms).
