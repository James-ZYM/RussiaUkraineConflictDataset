23,[],False,,ProfessorDowellsHead,,,[],,,,text,t2_hxfc4,False,False,"&gt; I'm fully aware Russian propaganda would still says that West is trying to destroy Russia, but we shouldn't give them more bullets to use. Not all russian people are believing Putin's propaganda, so it's still important to make it clear that the West is fighting against Russia's leaders and not Russian people, that difference is essential. If the West begins to act like Putin and get fully agressive, threatening russian people, you can be sure you'll lose all support you could get within Russia, and make Putin's propaganda stronger.

What does this mean? What Russian people are going to be swayed by France saying it wants rapprochement? The opposition is imprisoned for showing up on the streets - you think they're risking that only so long as Russia isn't humiliated? And, even if we assume without evidence that that is the case - what power do you believe this tiny slice of Russian society has to effect anything? On all evidence it is exactly zero power. Meanwhile, appeasement gives Putin hope the west will get tired of supporting Ukraine and a reason to keep spending Ukrainian lives in continued aggression.

&gt; Fighting a country doesn't prevent you from thinking how to deal with it after the end of the conflict. I don't see where is the problem at saying that we want to defeat it, but when it will be defeated it will be important to not humiliate it and instead just target the responsibles and re-establish diplomacy.

That may be true in the abstract but context absolutely matters. The context here is that Macron is talking about not humiliating Russia while it occupies 1/5th of Ukraine's territory, is continuing to attack Ukrainian troops, and kidnapping 200,000 Ukrainian children.  To stick with WWII, this would be talking about Germany must not be humiliated in 1942 - that is not the time for the conversation. You can even see this from Russian propaganda - their stated hope/plan for the war is that the West will get tired of supporting Ukraine so if Russia just keeps the war going until then it'll be able to triumph over the smaller and poorer country. When a leader of a major Western country starts talking about not being too harsh on Russia before it's even ceased offensive operations (to say nothing of withdrawn from territory it's taken), it serves to confirm Putin's thoughts about the war and to give him hope and reason to stick with it for longer. Each day that goes on more people die. So to me, Macron talking about this at this time has concrete negative effects in prolonging the war and no positive effects in ending it quicker (since Russian opposition has no ability to control anything in Russia). 

I guess what I am wondering is what is this worry about humiliation in response *to* if it isn't about conceding anything to Russia. What demands has anyone with sway in the Ukrainian government made or suggested as a condition of the end of hostilities which would humiliate Russia? The only things that have been talked about as conditions for ending the war is Russia leaves Ukrainian territory and funds reconstruction (and even this last is said as more of a 'this would be fair' than 'this is a condition of peace'). Presumably, Macron is responding to **something**. Considering the only Ukrainian demands appear to be for Russia to leave Ukraine and take responsibility for what it did, what is Macron advocating for or responding to? For that matter - what concrete thing are you responding to or worried about happening when you talk about the wisdom in avoiding 'humiliating' Russia?",a9e1554b8a5bb361963c0e9059bfae4bf32a5dd8,True,False,,,,,0,1654386853,,0,{},ib74qeb,False,t3_v4pq46,False,True,t1_ib72u5g,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4pq46/kotkin_stalin_biographer_in_a_foreign_affairs/ib74qeb/,1654386868,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654358053.0,

&gt;Neglecting basic values ​​and, among other things, tolerating someone's right to kill and plunder with impunity will shake the whole skeleton of the meanings on which the whole construction rests. If you question them, every European country, sometimes every one, can remember that it was once offended, and we just have to wait for the right moment to restore ""historical justice."" Of course, there are laws and agreements, but laws can be rewritten. Russia's goal, both for the elites and the masses, is to return the world to its previous state, where everything is decided by power and interest.

&gt;There are nations where values ​​are perceived as the core of identity: ""We will never be slaves"", ""For your and our freedom"" - everything is easier there. As soon as a croissant with coffee in the morning becomes the meaning of life, a platform for compromises appears. Ukraine, obviously, will not compromise, and this creates in Euro elites something like irritation. Well, sorry. Someone has to remind Europe that it is Europe.

Not all russian people are believing Putin's propaganda, so it's still important to make it clear that the West is fighting against Russia's leaders and not Russian people, that difference is essential. If the West begins to act like Putin and get fully agressive, threatening russian people, you can be sure you'll lose all support you could get within Russia, and make Putin's propaganda stronger.

When I talk about humiliation, I talk about how winners treats the populations of a country that lost a war, and Germany is a good example. Of course, suffering instability, economic problems and lack of infrastructure when you lose a war is common, but we cannot consider that as ""humiliation"" as it's not imposed by the winners themselves. However, when the winner, despite defeating the country and its army, is ripping its territory appart, deporting its population, imposing unfair treaties and unfeasible compensations, limiting its army, its production, its laws and its influence, you can see that as a humiliation. That's what happened after WW1, when Germany got imposed the Versailles Treaty, and that feeling of national humiliation made it impossible for a reconciliation between Germany and France, and just created a bigger hate, Hitler himself based a big part of his campaign on ending that unfair treaty.

But at the end of WW2, even if the country was bombed and ruined because of the war itself, the winners were careful to not ""humiliate"". Just remember the Morgenthau Plan, that was a Versaille Treaty 2.0 that was refused by Truman, who instead prefered the Marshal Plan, because allies knew it was better to trade and exchange with Germany than to ""humiliate"" it. Since then, (West) Germany had good relations with allies, and alliance became possible.

Of course, what we refer as humiliation only happens after a country is defeated, and of course Russia isn't defeated, but that's not the question. Fighting a country doesn't prevent you from thinking how to deal with it after the end of the conflict. I don't see where is the problem at saying that we want to defeat it, but when it will be defeated it will be important to not humiliate it and instead just target the responsibles and re-establish diplomacy. That's the more mature and reseanable thing to do, unlike going full Putin like ""we are going to crush you because you're inferior and all bas and we will erase your countries and culture"". Does that sound better to you?

And you seem to confuse some things that has been said. You seem to believe that ""not humiliating"" means ""letting them having a small victory"", but it's completely different. Not humiliating doesn't mean doing concessions, not at all! Again, the example of Germany after WW2 is good, at no point allies allowed nazi germany to get ""small victories"", it defeated its army and condemned the peoples seen as respondisle instead of condemning all of the population. And I guess that's what matters here, when we are talking about not humiliating Russia, we refer to it as a State Entity, basically saying that right know what France is blaming is the government and leaders, but not Russia as a whole, and that once these people are out of the way, we should treat Russia like any other country and make sure to start on good base, fair ones, and not attacking all of the population. Yet, that doesn't mean letting Russia having victories nor territories in Ukraine.",c5a5ce0f08deb278af7460fd19fac37bdbede411,True,False,,,,,0,1654385798,,0,{},ib72u5g,False,t3_v4pq46,False,True,t1_ib6dpei,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4pq46/kotkin_stalin_biographer_in_a_foreign_affairs/ib72u5g/,1654385814,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654356998.0,

Iraq is an artificial state carved out of the Ottoman Empire for the British Empire's administrative convenience. It had no institutions, poor education and a weak economy, because neither the Ottomans nor the British had any interest in developing it. 

What we call ""Iraq"" is a basket case of different ethnic and religious groups with no shared identity. Saddam Hussein only held it together via genocide and massive repression. 

The 2003 invasion/occupation removed Saddam, but also stupidly sacked the entire military and security forces. So you then had vast numbers of unemployed men with no money but lots of weapons and military training... in an unstable state with no institutions and huge ethnic and religious strife. Add Iran's interference, the rise of violent extremism, etc. and we got a slaughter house. To make it worse, Western states then ran a poorly executed counter-insurgency campaign that took 7+ years before it got it's shit together and by then it was too late. Add some corrupt Iraqi politicians and warlords and boom. 

Ergo... endless civil war.

I guess the guy's point was that it wasn't Iraqi ""culture"" to blame, and Iraq isn't ""some shithole"", but instead a battleground of foreign meddling, imperialism and incompetence.",331dad7fd9667aeb3a1bf1464b14307ead29175a,True,False,,,,,0,1654382253,,0,{},ib6wbe3,False,t3_v4jkzh,False,True,t1_ib6gtqa,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4jkzh/bond_between_americans_and_ukrainian_forces_they/ib6wbe3/,1654382268,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654353453.0,

438,[],False,,DucDeBellune,,,[],,,,text,t2_7acjaizj,False,False,"&gt;There's a few reasons. First off, that 'line that we don't want to cross' moves over time. Western aid has slowly been pushing that line further and further out. For example, the MLRS systems that the US has recently agreed to send to the Ukrainians would've likely been seen as a much bigger provocation a couple months ago then they are now. I know at some level that all seems pretty silly, but a lot about politics usually is.

That line moves both ways. As losses mount, Russia could feel that escalation is required. That’s a primary reason the US isn’t sending anything that could tip the war entirely in Ukraine’s favour. MLRS is great, but when you’re being pummelled by artillery constantly, it likely won’t have a massive impact.

&gt;But also, the longer this war drags on the weaker Russia gets. The more their military gets ground down, the more their economy gets battered by sanctions.

This isn’t really a fair point I don’t think. “Let’s extend the war to bleed Russia dry” when it severely increases the risk of famine and destroys Ukraine’s economy as well is the kind of bullshit politicians would say, but it’s more because of the first point i.e. being unwilling to help Ukraine win decisively.

Also by not supplying more potent weaponry and ammunition, Ukraine can’t capitalise on Russian vulnerabilities. 

&gt;Now, of course there is a trade-off to this strategy, and that is that it means Ukraine is going to be stuck fighting an invasion for longer. But I'm guessing the general feeling regarding that is that at this point the Russians are unlikely to capture any significant new territory, and they've already done a pretty thorough job of destroying everything of value in the places they're currently fighting.

I don’t think anyone thinks that’s the general feeling either. Ukraine has been entrenched in the Donbas for 8 years, but Russia has overwhelmingly superior firepower. It’s a slow grind- but a breakout is still absolutely possible. Putin clearly isn’t going to settle for another frozen conflict; it’s a reason he invaded when he did instead of letting it drag on longer.

Russia could partially or fully mobilise. It’s impossible at this stage to project if they will or not, but suggesting they’re kinda stuck where they currently are because advances have been slow this last month is a dangerous way of thinking. Without adequate munitions, Ukraine won’t be able to hold them off through the year. The downside there is they’re entirely dependent on foreign aid- and there is a limited supply of legacy Soviet shit in NATO arsenals that’s interoperable with Ukrainian equipment.",7643aa4887160034574d9d577289ca97f30147b5,True,False,,,,,0,1654381811,,0,{},ib6vhob,False,t3_v4oakp,False,True,t1_ib5i2e4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4oakp/we_dont_need_mediators_we_need_allies_who_cover/ib6vhob/,1654381822,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654353011.0,

[Translation of this](https://korrektur-initiative.ch/press_release/nach-schlussabstimmung-der-gegenvorschlag-zur-korrektur-initiative-ist-im-trockenen/)

&gt;Today, Parliament definitively passed its counter-proposal to the correction initiative in the final vote. Now, as announced, the alliance against arms exports to civil war countries can withdraw its initiative in view of the effective compromise.  
The correction initiative called for something to be taken for granted: from now on, arms exports should no longer be regulated by the Federal Council itself, but rather democratically at the legislative level. Priska Seiler Graf, National Councilor of the SP, says: ""Instead of arbitrary decisions, clear red lines and ethical standards that must not be violated are needed."" Specifically, deliveries to countries at war and to states that seriously or systematically violate human rights are to be banned.  
The majority of the counter-proposal, which Parliament passed today, meets the concerns of the initiative. Martin Landolt, National Councilor of the Center, says: ""From now on, anchoring the export regulation at the legislative level will allow parliament and the population to exercise the necessary democratic control over deliveries of war material.""  
Since the counter-proposal represents a good compromise, the Alliance against Arms Exports to Civil War Countries refrains from holding a referendum and, as announced, withdraws the correction initiative conditionally. “Since the launch of the correction initiative in 2018, numerous volunteers from NGOs and the civil population have been actively involved and have been able to achieve this great success. The effective implementation of the correction initiative by Parliament was more than necessary to finally ban arms exports to civil war countries once and for all,"" says Saskia Rebsamen, secretary of the correction initiative.",a1ff822fecd4118775573327f060ba55369ef7ed,True,False,,,,,0,1654381747,,0,{},ib6vde3,False,t3_v4rd9z,False,True,t1_ib6td64,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4rd9z/switzerland_is_once_again_blocking_military_aid/ib6vde3/,1654381757,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654352947.0,

You can also hit closer targets more easily as you aim your battle higher up, which makes it fall more-straight down on top of the target avoiding barricade like obstacles",97899db0434c03c651f558f534d28d1d2ecce602,True,False,,,,,0,1654381712,,0,{},ib6vb3z,False,t3_v4ubnp,False,True,t1_ib6gpxe,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4ubnp/ukrainian_positions_in_lysychansk_are_raining/ib6vb3z/,1654381728,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654352912.0,

As you point out Lukashenko is not stupid. I am pretty sure he can smell the blood in the water from Putin. Maybe Putin is politically fatally wounded, maybe he isn't. Regardless Luka must realize it is prudent to distance himself from Russia in general and Putin in particular to limit the fallout when Russia for various reasons finds it impossible to continue waging war, and have to accept the conditions that are on offer. The agreement with Ukraine would give Luka cover for kicking out the Russian troops.

At British request, the French sent the Argentines updated manuals that had incorrect wiring instructions for the Exocet warhead. Because of the updated instructions, several Exocet warheads did not explode.

Unfortunately, after the missile struck the British ships' superstructures, the rocket motors kept burning and eventually set the warheads on fire. The fires melted the aluminum superstructures of the British destroyers. Liquid aluminum poured down into the lower portions of the ships. The end result was Exocets caused as much or more damage than if the warheads had exploded.

It would have been better if the updated manuals mis-wired the guidance systems, but it was thought that disabling the warhead detonators would reduce the effectiveness of the missiles, not increase them.",6163c72ce1a2da32e871fb16f6e920eb2d0a4b9d,True,False,,,,,0,1654380634,,0,{},ib6tazg,False,t3_v47nt2,False,True,t1_ib2y7j5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v47nt2/france_may_soon_be_providing_exocet_anti_ship/ib6tazg/,1654380645,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654351834.0,

The Russians took Sievierodonetsk so quickly because the Ukrainians pulled back with minimal resistance, before pushing back in about a day later. From the reports, it sounds like the area would be hard to defend and with the Russians having pushed in so quickly thanks to the Ukrainian withdrawal they likely weren't properly dug in. Add in that Lysychansk seems to overlook Sievierodonetsk which gives the Ukrainian artillery an excellent position to target the Russians from. Just that would give the Russians massive casualties trying to hold the area.

The Russians have then either retreated or been forced out of most of the city. If this wasn't well organised, which given the circumstances is entirely plausible, the Ukrainians could have inflicted immense damage on the Russians while they were in no position to effectively retaliate.

Also, three months of experience means nothing in war. You could have years of experience but if you walk into an ambush or end up at a numerical disadvantage then you still have a good chance of dying. Likewise, an artillery shell doesn't care how long you've been fighting. If one lands on your position then you're dead.

Washington said this week that it was sending M142 high-mobility artillery rocket systems to Ukraine, which will more than double its army’s artillery range and allow it to strike targets 50 miles away.

“If, God forbid, these weapons are used against Russian territory then our armed forces will have no other choice but to strike decision-making centres,” said Dmitry Medvedev, a former prime minister under Putin who is deputy chairman of Russia’s national security council.

“Of course, it needs to be understood that the final decision-making centres in this case, unfortunately, are not located on the territory of Kyiv,” he said in an interview with Al Jazeera. Officials in Moscow have accused Nato of using the war in Ukraine to wage a proxy war against Russia.

Medvedev, who also served a single term as president from 2008 to 2012 but was widely viewed as Putin’s puppet, was once seen as a liberalising force in Russia but has transformed in recent months into one of Moscow’s biggest hawks.

He also warned that the fighting in Ukraine was pushing the world dangerously close to nuclear Armageddon, saying: “The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are already on their way and all hope now is with Lord God the Almighty.”

Kremlin-controlled state television has said on a number of occasions that Moscow could launch nuclear missiles against western countries, including Britain, if the war in Ukraine turns against Russia.

The White House said it had agreed to provide Ukraine with the guided missiles after receiving assurances from President Zelensky that they would not be used to hit targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said it did not believe Zelensky. “The United States is directly and intentionally adding fuel to the fire,” Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, said.

Russia has accused Ukraine of using combat helicopters and drones to carry out a number of cross-border strikes on villages and oil depots since the start of the war in February.

Yes, it is different, at least from many recent conflicts.

For example, recent conflicts initiated by the US were attempts to bring (western-friendly) stability and self-governance to places that were ruled by a genocidal autocrat (Iraq) or violently repressive religious fundamentalists (Afghanistan). I'm not saying these were good ideas, or were conducted well. But they are still very different from what Russia is doing: invading a stable, peaceful democratic country and intentionally destroying the lives of millions of civilians in an attempt to simply steal the land and resources for themselves.

Not videos of all russian citizens but at least *some* videos would be good. I've seen nothing like it with the exception of online comments like yours. Not sure what made you so confident this is the reason Russians aren't pushing back against their government. Everything I've seen indicates the majority of Russian citizens aren't doing anything about it because they fully support the Ukranian genocide.

&gt;Russia isn't a magical backward world where everyone is evil because evilness is what Russians do. It takes only a minority to come to power and subjugate. Most despotic regimes are quietly hated by terrified and hungry people.

Whether all Russians are ""evil"" or not is not my point nor my concern. My point is that the majority of them support their government enough to allow it to engage in armed conflicts with their neighbors, and they do it willingly without threat of torture or any other sort of repercussion. The Ukraine conflict is not a new concept to them. They have been doing the exact same thing for decades.

The collective actions of Russians are firmly incompatible with a stable and civilized world. Yes maybe not ALL Russians support Putin. But there's definitely not enough of those Russians to make a difference.

Ultimately there is no separation between Putin and Russian citizens when it comes to retaliation for starting a major war in Europe. Stopping Putin is up to Russians themselves.

""This year the frontline member states are expected, as we have discussed between us, to receive more than 150,000 migrants,"" Cyprus Interior Minister Nicos Nouris said on Saturday after a meeting with fellow ministers of the so-called MED5 group in Venice.

Some 36,400 asylum seekers and migrants have already landed in Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Malta this year, after 123,318 arrivals in 2021, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

Overall numbers, however, remain significantly below those of 2015, when over 1 million migrants reached the five countries to flee poverty and conflict across Africa and the Middle East.

A shortage of wheat and other grains could affect 1.4 billion people, United Nations crisis coordinator Amin Awad said on Friday, adding more negotiations were needed to unblock the ports in Ukraine to avoid famine and mass migration around the world.

Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, while Russia is also a key fertilizer exporter and Ukraine a major supplier of corn and sunflower oil.

1280,[],False,,ProfessorDowellsHead,,,[],,,,text,t2_hxfc4,False,False,"&gt; Russia's propaganda claims that the only thing NATO/EU wants is to erase Russia, so if France and other western nations just openly say they want to crush/destroy/defeat/humiliate Russia, you can be sure Russia will definitely use it to justify more its actions.

I think you don't appreciate the extent of Russian propaganda. They were saying the west wants to crush/destroy/defeat/humiliate Russia even when it was reaching out in the first Obama term. They've been saying this for the better part of the last 500 years, in fact! 

That narrative will continue regardless of what the West does, as it has for centuries. If the goal is to not give Russia a reason to say the West is targeting it, that goal is unachievable simply because that's not Russian domestic propaganda policy.

&gt; So yeah, humiliating a country is never a good solution, and always led to something worse.

Not quite correct, although I guess that depends on how one defines 'humiliation'. Post-WWII Germany had much more interference in its internal affairs, but it was defeated in such detail that it was not possible for domestic propaganda to characterize it as a 'humiliation'. Certainly allied reconstruction played a part of that but the extent to which self-determination was taken away from Germany was greater at the end of WWII than WWI.

More importantly - Russia has not yet been defeated. What you're considering is what happened *after a country was defeated*. Personally, I think that the post-WWI problem from Germany was more to do with the country not *accepting* its defeat (and so casting about for groups to blame it on and to try again) than it was humiliation from allied demands, but that's immaterial to my point. 

First, an aggressor country must be defeated. **Then** discussion of the appropriate peace terms can take place. If an aggressor is kept from 'humiliation' by being given some of what it demanded - that's rewarding aggression not just avoiding humiliating it needlessly. 

That's what Macron seems to be suggesting when he's talking about not humiliating Russia. After all, the absolute most aggressive ideas from the Ukrainian side about peace terms seem to be: Russia returning the land it has taken from Ukraine over the last 15 years and paying for the destruction it has wrought. That doesn't seem all that humiliating to me, other than of course being a clear defeat.

Do you think Russia should be defeated on the territory of Ukraine before there's too much worrying about humiliating it in the peace, or are you advocating that it should be appeased and allowed to have a small victory (and Ukraine take a small defeat) to avoid this humiliation? 

Also, mind clarifying what terms of peace is Macron (or you) worried about Ukraine asking for that would humiliate Moscow and what are the reasons you believe those terms are likely to be demanded?",8ef9cc3c2692a0c0be43506cadd698db31d78ac6,True,False,,,,,0,1654372374,,0,{},ib6dpei,False,t3_v4pq46,False,True,t1_ib5sfvw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4pq46/kotkin_stalin_biographer_in_a_foreign_affairs/ib6dpei/,1654372389,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654343574.0,

Yes, they might have done more to support Ukraine, but so far the only thing they did/do in favor of Russia is buying their gas, and as you know a large percentage of German gas consumption comes from Russia, so it's not out of the world to assume that removing that supply could have bad consequences for Germany. Which is why you can't blame that one thing they do in favor of Russia on wanting to play both sides, if there is reasonable doubt in form of economic consequences. 

Yes, Germany could and should do more. I am deeply disappointed with Scholz, and next election I will definitely vote green, and I always hated them, but their stance on this war needs to be rewarded. Even though they might implement a tempo limit on my beloved Autobahn! 

But the way I see it Scholz doesn't try to play both sides. For German standards his statements are pretty warmingerish (no kidding!). Germans are REALLY docile and pacifistic, to a fault. Scholz did call Putin some time ago, like one or two months, and asked for a ceasefire. It's reported that he also reminded Putin of Russia's and Ukraine's role in feeding the world, and I only thought: ""You stupid, naive motherfucker, you pointed out how he's able to blackmail the world!"", and what happens a few weeks later? News: Putin agrees to lift embargo on grain exports in exchange for lifted sanctions. Oh the surprise!

In Germany we get several years of education about the Holocaust, about the two world wars we caused, about how militaristic German society was, about what we did to the Jews, that the bad conscience is basically unbearable, and that this guilt for something which the newer generations didn't even do can never be repaid. Scholz really seems to have a bad estimation for things, and is probably being counselled by officers from the Bundeswehr and agents from the BND, which are two pretty amateurish organisations in their own respect. (Example BND: we can't send a mole in any terrorist organisation, because being part in a terrorist organisation is punishable, so sending someone would be incitement of a felony. And the secret service doesn't get a free pass, because our highest court ruled that exceptions to incitement of a felony would be immoral and that the German constitution applies to every human, not only Germans. Which is why it's also almost impossible to get a judge to sign the permission to tap a terrorist, because it requires undeniable proof they are planning something illegal. Hard to come up with proof without insiders or tapping.)

Due to his poor knowledge and information Scholz is afraid of going Emperor Wilhelm II. and due to ""too much support"" of an ally dragging Germany into a world war. Like, LOL. But that's it, he said it (allegedly). 

I feel like that caution is slowly dropping though, probably as ever heavier equipment is being delivered,  the dead Russians are piling up and no nuclear holocaust is happening. At that point maybe the experts of the Bundeswehr start going ""Maybe the info that Russia is a neverending source of humans and material, like in WW2, isn't true any more? Hmmmm..."" and Scholz doesn't only get balder, he also gets bolder.

Stryuk's direct speech on the question of what percentage of the city is occupied: ""I would not say that it is occupied. ""But our military has managed to regroup, build a line of defense. And now all necessary measures are being taken to return the city to full control of Ukraine. The city remains Ukrainian.""

""Our military is taking all appropriate measures to push the enemy out of the city, positional street battles are being fought. This is accompanied by constant artillery shelling. The situation is quite tense, but there is hope and there is confidence in our Armed Forces that everything will work out.""

Details : According to the head of the military civilian administration, about 13,000 people remained in Severodonetsk before the assault.

""Given that there have been constant street fights for three days now, the population that was there remains, except for a small part, which the orcs managed to forcibly remove from the city to the occupied territories,"" he said.

&gt; Prosecutors investigating war crimes cases in Ukraine are examining allegations of the forcible deportation of children to Russia since the invasion as they seek to build a genocide indictment, the country&amp;#039;s top prosecutor has said.

&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said in mid May that Russia had relocated more than 210,000 children during the conflict, part of more than 1.2 million Ukrainians who Kyiv said have been deported against their will.

&gt; Venediktova said the investigations to build a genocide case - covering the forced deportation of children and other acts - were targeting areas from northern Ukraine down to Mykolaiv and Kherson on the southern coast.

As said, the existing extra western firepower is not enough to change this stall significantly enough. (And this is exactly what NATO wants.)

Each time Russia fires, UA will counter fire and vice versa. (Both have similar systems) So if Russia wants to prevent depletion in 20months they need to lower the rate of fire and hide their troops and machinery = the battle will de-intensify because it helps both sides to lower the losses without loosing or gaining territory =The the same result, but fewer losses. 

The rate of losses is simply to high on both sides to keep loosing men and equipment at this rate. This must have an effect on the battlefield tactics. 

Why ukraine will win: 
As said, i assume that UA will get a few really effective BTG’s that can overwhelm russian positions completely. This ‘terrifying truth’  can be very useful at the negotiation table since Ukraine have proven that they can gear up and crush the russian army if they scale this technique to other BTG’s. 

That way Ukraine can negotiate territory in stead of fighting her way trough 100BGT’s (and losing 50k soldiers, spending 10x more money over a long periode of time.)

So NATO has what it wants at 10x less cost and in 2x less time. Exactly where NATO is aiming for. 

Russian propaganda machine can later claim what they want. Problem solved. This can not be said if NATO gives UA full firepower to crush the whole Russian army. The propaganda machine cannot hide that fact because they will also lose Crimea. It’s impossible to claim anything. 

In the other case Russia can claim for example: Denazification (it’s joke after all, but anyway they can claim it) De-militarisation (Nato will stop delivering weapons, UA will not become a NATO member) and maybe Russia will get some influence in the Donbas regio  (for example Russian language will be official or something)",fc3ff05cda439995615eac9aeb31863571385e2a,True,False,,,,,0,1654367714,,0,{},ib658bh,True,t3_v4khw0,False,True,t1_ib5uibr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4khw0/according_to_a_retired_dutch_lieutenant_general/ib658bh/,1654367725,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654338914.0,

What a complete load of bull. Is that why the Japanese stayed on the defensive for the entire rest of the war?

&gt; The IJN still badly outnumbered the US in aircraft carriers

No, it didn't... They literally lost half of their entire fleet at Midway, and it was by far the better half of their fleet. The US still had most of the carriers it started the war with, so no, they were not ""badly outnumbered"". It was essentially 1:1 at that point in the war, and the US's carriers were much better than the remaining Japanese ones. And this all of course doesn't even begin to touch on the insane building program that was going on at the time.

&gt;and trumped the United States Pacific Fleet in battleships

You mean the absolute most useless piece of naval hardware in the entire war? Sure, Japan had a couple of really scary battleships, but they did literally nothing the entire war because they were useless.

&gt; destroyers

They actually had equivalent amounts at the start of the war. I didn't check for the two cruisers given how badly you've misrepresented all the other stats though.

&gt; The biggest advantage was not only numerical but also weaponry (better torpedos) good training. Most importantly night tactics.

1754,[],False,,pkstrl0rd,,,[],,,,text,t2_azdfs,False,False,"As cynical as it may be Macron and Scholz are simply looking at things from a long term perspective. Yes, every day that the war continues an escalation to the rest of Europe becomes more likely, western stockpiles are further depleted, energy prices keep soaring while energy security goes down. No one is saying ""Lets just keep the lines if control as borders and make peace now."" Macron is simply trying to keep up the dialogue with Russia, which is crucial. At the same time he may get glimpses into what the state of the mind and the morale is like in the Kremlin.

At the end of the day Ukraine is of course free to fight as long as they want, but they shouldn't expect unlimited monetary help and weapon supplies if they dismiss their allies suggestions and insult them like this. Don't bite the hand that feeds you, remember? Ukrainian politicians should know better than to make insulting statements like this. What do France and Germany owe to Ukraine? There are no close cultural ties and they are helped simply because they were the victim.

Of course some of the west is happy to watch this play out, but doesn't want to send their own soldiers when Ukraine is doing the job for them and weakening their traditional enemy at the cost of their lives. And if the west massively ramps up military support and Ukrainians start to bulldoze towards the Russian border with Nato tanks and equipment, I think Russia woukd consider that an ""Existential threat"" and use tactical nuclear weapons.

I think the US would be content to continue sending weapons and helping in all ways for years, because the war has little consequences for the American economy and public. However Europe is suffering from the sanctions and the high price of energy more and more and we dont have the reserves in neither Oil, Gas or weapons that the US does, which is why Scholz and Macron want peace sooner rather than later. Many European countries also want to resume trading and some political relations to make up for the hit the economy will take and to ease the tensions with Russia to ensure there is stability in Europe.

 And my estimate is that public opinion will start pressuring European politicians to stop the war in 5-7 months due to astronomical gasoline prices, heating, food prices and the fact that the biggest economies in Europe are pretty far from the conflict and have no ties to Ukraine so people's support will start to wane.  Also there is the fact that most likely a recession is coming to Europe and when people's daily lives become harder they want the economy to bounce back as soon as possible. The public will start complaining about the billions promised to rebuild Ukraine and the cost of the waraid and why it isn't being used to help their own countries first.

Poland will probably be very against this shift along with baltics, but when the tide in EU starts turning and EU threatens to cut all EU funding to Poland on the pretext of the ""Rule of law"" -issue, my guess is Poland concede and agree to pressure Ukraine to give up some territory in the peace agreement because PiS wants to stay in power. And the Baltic States dont have much sway or much to give.

Please don't think I'm some Russian shill because of my predictions. I'm from Finland and we have been where you are, and we were no less reluctant to hand over territory for peace in the winter war. After the war people swore for centuries that the land would one day be taken back, but it was quickly Russified completely.

I truly hope Russia is the one who breaks first, but they are used to enduring such hardships, unlike the west. If the worst comes to pass, please remember that the main thing is that you will retain your sovereignty. My prediction is that you will be forced to concede Crimea, most of Donbass excluding Sloviansk and Kramatorsk and a land bridge to Crimea, narrower than it is now, but unfortunately most likely including Mariupol. However I do think you will be able to free Kherson and push them further east.

Hope I am wrong though.

&gt;Besides Germany had sent 6 PzH to Lithuania for the NATO in February.: I suppose that nonetheless these still belong to Germany‘s army.

They very much still belong to germany because they were not send to Lithuanias military but to a german lead battlegroup stationed in Lithuania, meaning active german military personal. They were already included in the opersaional number...

“They enable a leader to convince followers that they were unfairly cheated of power by those that the leader demonizes. That Trump and his supporters are continuing to advance their big lie, even in the face of overwhelming proof that it is false, is deeply concerning.”

Also worth pointing out that the entire German debt management plan was to win the war. That's not a joke.

Of course ""The west"" (Not the common people mostly, but the military and politicians) doesn't want to send their own soldiers when Ukraine is doing the job for them and weakening their traditional enemy. I think this is a pretty obvious fact that everyone knows, or should realize.

I think the US would be content to continue sending weapons and helping in all ways for years, because the war has little consequences for the American economy and public. However Europe is suffering from the sanctions and the high price of energy more and more and we dont have the reserves in neither Oil, Gas or weapons that the US does, which is why Scholz and Macron want peace sooner rather than later. Many European countries also want to resume trading and some political relations to make up for the hit the economy will take and to ease the tensions with Russia to ensure there is stability in Europe.

 And my estimate is that public opinion will start pressuring European politicians to stop the war in 5-7 months due to astronomical gasoline prices, heating, food prices and the fact that the biggest economies in Europe are pretty far from the conflict and have no ties to Ukraine so people's support will start to wane.  Also there is the fact that most likely a recession is coming to Europe and when people's daily lives become harder they want the economy to bounce back as soon as possible. The public will start complaining about the billions promised to rebuild Ukraine and the cost of the waraid and why it isn't being used to help their own countries first.

Poland will probably be very against this shift along with baltics, but when the tide in EU starts turning and EU threatens to cut all EU funding to Poland on the pretext of the ""Rule of law"" -issue, my guess is Poland concede and agree to pressure Ukraine to give up some territory in the peace agreement because PiS wants to stay in power. And the Baltic States dont have much sway or much to give.

Please don't think I'm some Russian shill because of my predictions. I'm from Finland and we have been where you are, and we were no less reluctant to hand over territory for peace in the winter war. After the war people swore for centuries that the land would one day be taken back, but it was quickly Russified completely.

I truly hope Russia is the one who breaks first, but they are used to enduring such hardships, unlike the west. If the worst comes to pass, please remember that the main thing is that you will retain your sovereignty. My prediction is that you will be forced to concede Crimea, most of Donbass excluding Sloviansk and Kramatorsk and a land bridge to Crimea, narrower than it is now, but unfortunately most likely including Mariupol. However I do think you will be able to free Kherson and push them further east.

Hope I am wrong though.

Amazingly, the author of the article said it too but to a disturbing reaction in Europe:

“A few years ago, during a panel discussion on th sion on the politics of memory at a university in a German-speaking country, I called Russian President Vladimir Putin “the most powerful fascist politician in the world.” 

“Afterwards, the organizers shyly told me that while the event had gone well, the label I applied to the Kremlin leader was “too much” – even though Russia had by that time already occupied Crimea and started a war in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. I was surprised not so much by the organizers’ comment as by the way they made it. They seemed genuinely embarrassed, as if I had said something obscene.”

“The first Russian bombs that fell on Ukraine on February 24 vindicated my apparent vulgarity. Unfortunately, Putin’s fascism had become so accepted by Western financial and political elites that they were uncomfortable publicly denouncing earlier: It was “too much” until it was “too late.” Even as the obvious and incontrovertible evidence piles up, many still have not abandoned their reluctance to call a spade a spade.”

“Putin not only denies Ukrainians’ right to exist, but also controls a propaganda machine that has issued a manifesto proclaiming his genocidal aim to eliminate Ukrainians as such. Moreover, he has at his disposal a state that is ready to execute his genocidal fantasies and exterminate Ukrainians because he thinks they should not exist.”",0a698129de6686104ef6f14ffc1f93f7badadcfa,True,False,,,,,0,1654362835,,0,{},ib5w0sm,True,t3_v4swhy,False,True,t1_ib5ur16,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4swhy/why_does_the_west_refuse_to_call_putins_russia/ib5w0sm/,1654362846,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654334035.0,

My reasoning was based on the arty losses in the last 100 days. And also on Russia's arty losses in the 12 months before the 2022 February escalation.  
  
&gt; The western world can ship 100k shells in no time but has only a handful attack drones.

&gt; So i believe the battlefield will stall some day.  
  
There won't be a stall, because Russia will continue to lose artillery. Or decrease arty deployment. Which means the total volume of damage that Russia's arty can inflict is limited and will get depleted at some time in the future.

The Putin regime has been able to carry out genocides in neighboring countries for decades, without any real fear of protest of genocide. Russians are either too apathetic to do something about it, or they fully support Putin. 

Either way, allowing the same Russians that have allowed a murderous regime to fester for decades into western countries seems unfair for the rest of the world.

IMO it is RUSSIANS the ones that have to fix this. No international army will invade Russia and remove putin. Change must come from within.

If someone talks about war and NATO and repeats the word Ukraine 15 times, he wants Ukraine to do work for NATO.

Just a few of my favs: 
Definitely not going to invade Ukraine, y’all are nuts for even suggesting that. Our massive buildup of troops and equipment is just for training. 

Moskva definitely is fine, just going to port for some routine maintenance. Oh, minor normal fire broke out, everything is fine. Oh, Moskva is experiencing some turbulent weather but no worries, we’ve rescued 100% of the sailors and everyone is safe and sound. 

We’re not directly targeting civilians. 

We have no imperialistic goals, just denazification. 

Putin definitely doesn’t have cancer, only an insane person would think Putin is anything  but the epitome of healthy. 

We stopped having casualties. 

Our troops are very well equipped and looked after and their safety as heroes of Russia is a high priority.

But the main point is that representative democracy is an aid to the direct democracy, not the other way around. Which means that the unhindered option of referendums unhindered by politicians has to be available at all times.  
  
PS.  
The majority of citizenry in OECD countries are more competent at environmental decisions and at migration issues than the elite of those countries.  
  
Rank correlation between [biocapacity deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint) and [share of immigrants in a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population) is statistically significantly negative, which means that mass immigration destroys local natural environment.  
  
US DoD annual reports on global threats have since Obama government emphasized that mass migrations and AGW are global threat multipliers. But curiously one cannot find even a single party among any OECD member states which would simultaneously support a combination of restricting mass immigration AND supporting a globally equal carbon tax with WTO adjustment tariffs and with full citizen dividends (Nordhaus's and James Hansen's Tax &amp; Dividend), even though the majority will of the citizenry has been behind both for decades already. The crosstabulation of scientific and public positions against that of the parties suggests an arbitrage (a dilemma for voters) at higher than 6-sigma significance (with chi-square test or similar) to systematically avert democracy on an industrial scale. Such a situation could not have emerged in democracies.

- **Ukraine foreign minister says Paris is humiliating itself**

- **No point negotiating now, says Ukraine presidential adviser**

PARIS/KYIV, June 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine rebuked French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday for saying it was important not to ""humiliate"" Russia, a position Ukrainian foreign minister Dmitro Kuleba said ""can only humiliate France"".

Macron has sought to maintain a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February. His stance has been repeatedly criticised by some eastern and Baltic partners in Europe, as they see it as undermining efforts to push Putin to the negotiating table.

""We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means,"" Macron said in an interview with regional newspapers published on Saturday. ""I am convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power.""

Kuleba responded on twitter: ""Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it.

""Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.""

Macron has spoken with Putin regularly since the invasion as part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and begin a credible negotiation between Kyiv and Moscow, although he has had no tangible success to show for it.

""I think, and I told him (Putin), that he is making a historic and fundamental mistake for his people, for himself and for history,"" Macron said.

*****
&gt; Russia urged Turkey not to launch an offensive in northern Syria after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed threats of a military campaign targeting Kurdish &amp;quot;Terrorists&amp;quot;.

&gt; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday also warned NATO ally Turkey against a military offensive in Syria, saying it would put the region at risk.

&gt; Turkey has launched three military operations into northern Syria since 2016, seizing areas along the border in what it said was a bid to secure its frontier from threats from ISIL and the YPG. The YPG-linked Syrian Democratic Forces warned a military operation by Ankara would undermine efforts to combat fighters from the ISIL armed group in northeastern Syria.

No there is no unity because Poland and Bulgaria refused gas blackmail and then Italy and Germany accepted it even after the EU made a statement that nobody would do it and there would be an united front. 

5% **potential** GDP loss of Germany/Italy -&gt; EU unity.

A united response would have forced Russia to simply back down and respect its contractual obligations as it simply can't stop selling gas to the entirety of Europe.

Instead now Putin has a clear example where Germany and Italy will break unity - 5% GDP.

Despite all the screeching from the propaganda harpies about how Russia is being threatened on all sides, with NATO just waiting to pounce, nobody is actually interested in conquering any part of Russia. Everybody hopes they'd just stay in their own country for a while.

Nobody is looking at that piss-poor sinkhole of wife beating alcoholics and thinks, ""I want a piece of that territory"".

Which means that Russia can (and is) grind up their entire army in a war of aggression and choice.

If Putin has 200000 men, and he decides that he needs 20000 to defend any conquered territory, then guess what? He is gonna conquer until 180000 of his troops are dead. 

He doesn't give a shit about his own troops, he doesn't give a shit about the well-being of his own citizens, he doesn't give a shit about the ""Russians"" civilians that he is claiming to liberate, and he is purposefully exterminating Ukrainian civilians (anybody remember the Mariupol theatre with the ""Children"" sign out front that got precision bombed?)

At this point, Putin is an absolute Monarch on a level of Louis the 14th, Czar Putin, and his cruelty is synonymous with Hitler.

And if Russia loses 100000 men but keeps a square meter of Ukrainian territory, he'll mark that as a ""win"". 

And then they'll pull another 3000 tanks from the seemingly inexhaustible pile of shitty soviet gear, slap a few gadgets on it and call it ""T-2022"", rebuild their army, and do the same thing to some other neighbour in 10 years, just like they have done before.

lol Russian propaganda wants us to call for more support for Ukraine and especially more weapon deliveries?

Valid criticism =/= divisive propaganda.

What is divisive is the attitude of the above mentioned governments. 

They clearly show that European unity is only applies to the East being consumers of their products and source of cheap labor. Certainly not when it comes to helping with existential security concerns. The US being on the other side of the world is doing infinitely more helpful than our fellow member states. 

The risk of 3-5% of GDP loss and Russian raw materials are clearly more important than ensuring security in the East.

&gt;You are correct about obvious things. 4 weeks into the war Germany had send all their existing stocks from the Bundeswehr (easily rivaling contributions from countries delivering weapons for years) and then declared that everything else now has to come from the manufacturers directly.

Three days into the war Scholz received a list with 100 Leo 1s and 100 Marders available for Ukraine, it's been 97 days since then, what happened? Germany has 500+ M109s sitting somewhere in reserve, what has happened to those? Norway pulled out its own M109s out of deep reserve and they are already in Ukraine.

Calling for an immediate ceasefire inevitably equals concessions.

A ceasefire is only an option when the Russian troops are out of Ukraine. Otherwise it only serves to give Putin an opportunity to annex already occupied territory, mobilize and properly organize a further attack.

Refusing to deliver weapons of consequence also equals concessions. The current stream of weapons coming from France/Germany/Italy would be enough to help Ukraine barely hold on as a state but certainly not enough to achieve victory. 

Scholz has spelled it out, he is unwilling to provide offensive weapons, even though Germany could have already shipped 100 Leo 1s and 100 Marders.",8ad23e8333ccd6fe80c8ed9ba4be7624e7af89fd,True,False,,,,,0,1654356057,,0,{},ib5j6ja,False,t3_v4mw78,False,True,t1_ib5gbe9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4mw78/interviewed_by_afp_today_macron_repeated_russia/ib5j6ja/,1654356067,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654327257.0,

(Source = https://minusrus.com/en)

The only think you can wish for is Ukraine is able to destroy all modern artillery equipment so Russia is unable to match the pace of war. It depends a bit how many guided Artillery Ukraine has. 

But we don’t know the exact numbers on both sides. That’s a big problem. 

Some say Russia has in de Donbas region 900 artillery pieces spread over 100 BTG’s. Most of the are guided. 

Ukraine is rapidly reinforced but some say it can take months to prepare a large scale war with western weapon system. 

US have send multiple counter-artillery radar systems. They can trace back ballistic artillery rounds based on their flight path even before the shell landed. 

All this target information is put in the UA owned GIS ‘Arta’ (can also be a drone based coordinate) communication system to rapidly counterattack enemy positions. 

Combine this with western long range guides missiles and Russia must fear a super fast and deadly enemy than can attack in a rate no Russia battalion can outrun. But again, it takes time to implement the new western systems into the Arta system.

2820,[],False,,shawnaroo,,,[],,,,text,t2_37ymx,False,False,"There's a few reasons. First off, that 'line that we don't want to cross' moves over time. Western aid has slowly been pushing that line further and further out. For example, the MLRS systems that the US has recently agreed to send to the Ukrainians would've likely been seen as a much bigger provocation a couple months ago then they are now. I know at some level that all seems pretty silly, but a lot about politics usually is. 

But also, the longer this war drags on the weaker Russia gets. The more their military gets ground down, the more their economy gets battered by sanctions. 

While it sounds 'obvious' to say ""yeah well we can just keep all of the sanctions in place even after the war ends to teach Russia a lesson, the reality is that their oil/gas is still relevant on the world market and there would be a lot of political pressure in many places to remove various sanctions. Having the war still going on makes it a lot easier to push back against that pressure. 

Also, at the end of all of this, it will be significantly more humiliating for Russia and Putin when they're defeated by the Ukrainians, a country far smaller and supposedly far weaker than they are. Having NATO or whoever roll in and push Russia out in a couple weeks would give Russians 'an excuse' for why they lost, and likely preclude any chance that there might be some introspection among their people as to why the actions of their country have been horrible and stupid. 

But really I think a primary goal for western powers is not only to help Ukraine win this war, but for it to result in a Russia that is so militarily and economically worn out that they won't be able to significantly threaten any neighbors for a generation or two, even if they continue with the mindset that resulted in this invasion in the first place. 

Short of WWIII, there is pretty much a zero percent chance that any western countries will launch attacks on Russian soil, so anything that the Russians are smart enough to leave in their own country will likely remain available for them to cause problems with in the future. But if Putin still thinks he's got a shot in Ukraine, then he'll keep tossing men and equipment into the meat grinder. And due to Russia's economic issues, the wide range of sanctions, and their demographic issues, they will have a very hard time replacing those losses anytime soon. 

Now, of course there is a trade-off to this strategy, and that is that it means Ukraine is going to be stuck fighting an invasion for longer. But I'm guessing the general feeling regarding that is that at this point the Russians are unlikely to capture any significant new territory, and they've already done a pretty thorough job of destroying everything of value in the places they're currently fighting. 

And hopefully, in exchange for Ukraine being the front line in this fight against the Russians, the west will be quite generous when helping them rebuild after the war. And the end result will be a Ukraine much stronger than it would've been otherwise, and a Russia far too weak to even think of messing with the Ukrainians in the future.",f7ed2059eefee56f02c3af3dc7cdbd086bb1b10d,True,False,,,,,0,1654355431,,0,{},ib5i2e4,False,t3_v4oakp,False,True,t1_ib5fi9w,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4oakp/we_dont_need_mediators_we_need_allies_who_cover/ib5i2e4/,1654355442,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654326631.0,

The reality is that Russia continues because of the hopes it has gotten from the above mentioned states that it will be able to break Western unity. 

It has gotten this from the many hour long sweet talks and direct calls for cease fires again only from the above mentioned states combined with very little military support for Ukraine, enough to stop Russia from taking over the entire country but not enough to help Ukraine achieve victory.

Seeing diplomacy with Putin before a military victory has been achieved for Ukraine is useless and extremely counter-productive, it is only giving Putin the belief that he can outlast the wavering West. The current Russian regime depends on a military victory, so they will not stop before they either:

1. achieve it
2. become convinced that they can't achieve it

There is a good quote by Solzhenitsyn:

“And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”

This is a glorified imperial policing action being fought by contract soldiers and mercenaries.  Russia isn't fighting the defacto west, its fighting Ukraine who have some low level western weapons.

If Russians thought they were in ww3 they would not be avoiding service or crying about being trolled on the Internet.    In no way does the psychology of Russians see this in any way like a struggle for survival in a ww2 total war situation.  Quite the opposite.  They see this as being like one of the US world police actions or  French/British Post colonial conflict.  Because it is.

And that's just psychology.  On the battlefield the comparison is laughable.  The operations are extremely similar to both Georgia and Chechenya.  Ukraine is just bigger, much bigger.  The problems coming from western arms arriving on the battlefield are the same as Afghanistan.  The political orientated operation at the start of the conflict was identical to Hungary.  The later tactics were pulled entirely from the Syria game plan.  None of these things are remotely similar to ww2.

The geographic area being similar is true.

Hold on, i'm not Russian. I did live there for almost 2 decades though, so i know the people well.

&gt; to all to give your own lives if necessary to end this

People won't rise up unless things get really bad, and even then, there is no guarantee. People are willing to put up with a lot of shit before they are willing to risk their lives.

Its easy to say when you are sat on your computer, telling others to risk their lives. Not so easy when you have family you need to support and your death will be worthless and your family will continue to suffer regardless.

Russia needs to reach the point where the propaganda is no longer working, where the economy is so bad it can't be dismissed or their sons are dying in so many numbers that it cannot be ignored.

And even then, revolution might not happen. Russians are used to dealing with shit, and they might just bunker down as Putin becomes more and more of a tyrant and the police state becomes like North Korea, and give it a generation or two, and there will never be hope of any sort of revolution.

I hope you'd have some sympathy for the people of Russia if it came to that. I certainly have a lot of sympathy for the people of North Korea, living under the regime there. They have no hope of revolution, they are too indoctrinated and oppressed to even consider it.

&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Russians in Russia may need to die to make any small level of change.

No, i don't think that is required. If things get bad enough, if enough soldiers die, Putin will have to escalate, in which case he will likely be removed from power or he will back down and be removed from power.

Alternately, if there is enough discontent in the country, and revolution happens, i don't think many people will die. The moment the army/police start firing on people in numbers, that will be it, the regime will fall. Even the police and army will not stand for shooting their own people, their own families and friends... or at least, I hope so. There are some real nutjobs in OMON, but i hope they would be turned on by others.

&gt; You can die in the streets in Russia to make change today. Why are you in reddit doing nothing?

Because i'm not Russian, i left Russia, and because i have family if i had gone out on the street to rebel, i'd be in jail, and my family would be left to struggle without me.

So sorry, but please fuck off with that sort of talk. Easy to talk big when you are sat on reddit yourself.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comPARIS, June 4 - French President Emmanuel Macron said it is vital that Russia is not humiliated so that when the fighting stops in Ukraine a diplomatic solution can be found, adding that he believed Paris would play a mediating role to end the conflict.

&gt; Macron has sought to maintain a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin since Moscow&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine in February.

&gt; &amp;quot;We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means,&amp;quot; Macron said in an interview to regional newspapers published on Saturday.

Yeah a french company delivered military grade thermal cameras until 2020 as part of an ongoing contract. This is unfortunate but stop acting like France has basically armed russian army by itself and that these thermal cameras are the reason for this invasion. 

In the meantime France [did a lot to help Ukraine upgrade its army and was the first weapons exporter to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020 (for a total over 1,5 billion euros)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) that comes in addition to other military related help such as training and daily access to our satellite intel. 

The truth is that people like you just want to shit on France and are absolutely willing to disregard literally every concrete things France did for Ukraine since 2014 and just keep on focusing on a thousand of cameras delivered to Russia between 2014 and 2020 for a grand total of 150 millions (which is peanuts when it comes to defense contracts).

4) They had another go at it a few years later- the ""second Chechnya war"". Russia again (eventually) won.

5) The late daddy Kadyrov was originally on the side of independence, but switched guys allegiance to Putin's Russia during the second war.

After all, the Russians invaded Ukraine in 2014. But they didn’t start there. There has also been South Ossetia, which is 20% of Georgia. Then there is Chechnya, making Belarus a vassal state, ditto for Hungary (via use of gas and oil control),Transnistria, a part of Moldova. Let’s follow that up with destabilising the USA (interference in elections so that a Russian asset, Trump, got in to power), the UK (Brexit and Conservative party), trying to break up the EU (Brexit), and much more.

Russia has openly stated that it intends to obliterate Ukraine, the word Ukraine, all Ukrainian a and the Ukrainian language.  Russia has openly stated that it will invade Poland, that it will use nuclear weapons on the UK and many other countries.

Russian policy has been to control Europe through their supply of oil and gas.  This has meant that Europe has allowed Russia, under Putin, to get away with murder, slaughter, corrupting politicians, and now, genocide.

I agree that Russia is capable of manufacturing much, after all it does have access to lots of raw materials - including iron and steel it is currently sterling from Mariupol, and millions of tonnes of grain from Ukraine.

It does not mean that Russia shall succeed in ruling the Ukraine. It also does not mean that Russia will succeed in invading other countries; not now.  

Russia has driven NATO, a defensive organisation to invigorate itself, for countries, which would never have joined NATO, except for Russia invading Ukraine, to apply to join.  European countries are starting to increase military spending and to take the risk of Russian aggression, which never actually stopped), seriously. 

Russian aggressive, genocidal, actions are what is making people understand what the situation is.  If Russia do succeed in winning in Ukraine complete genocide will occur. Europe understands that.  Russia won’t stop at Ukraine, if they do manage to win.

The best thing that has helped the Ukraine? The outright corruption and theft of trillions by Oligarchs, senior politicians, senior military officers.

The theft has kept Russia close to bankruptcy.  Just think what could have been done for the Russian people if all those trillions had been spent on infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, roads, trains, etc.  just think if the improved health, the increased lifespan and the improvements in standards of living there could have been.",1adde571016ce9f6415760d1383414d5846c4053,True,False,,,,,0,1654345353,,0,{},ib51zbp,False,t3_v4khw0,False,True,t1_ib4vbq3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4khw0/according_to_a_retired_dutch_lieutenant_general/ib51zbp/,1654345369,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654316553.0,

Even before the first sanctions is was clear that despite the sanctions, Russia would earn 1,5% more profit on gas/coal/oil exports due to estimated rise in prices. It was clear that the sanctions would not 'bite' Russia in the first year.

3741,[],False,,zebsdee,,,[],,,,text,t2_9um0yw2,False,False,"&gt;Initial pessimism about the ease with which Russian forces could overwhelm Ukraine was followed by a surge of optimism as the Ukrainians gained the upper hand. After a month of war, Moscow gave up on Kyiv and other northern targets and decided to focus its efforts on the eastern Donbas region. Allowing themselves little time to recover from those early defeats, the Russians pushed hard but still struggled to make progress. An apparent deadline of May 9, the anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, passed without any notable gains.  
In recent weeks, the war seems to have gone better for the Russians. They finally captured the port city of Mariupol. Now they are seeking to complete the conquest of Luhansk by taking Sievierodonetsk. The Ukrainians are more candid about their heavy casualties as shells, rockets and bombs crash into their defensive lines. Russia’s gains have led to a new pessimism.  
This bleaker view credits the Russians with sorting out their logistics, following realistic objectives and playing to their strengths, especially in artillery and aircraft. They continue to display indifference to the costs of their advances in lives and property. Instead of last month’s worries about whether Vladimir Putin might adopt desperate measures as his forces retreated, this month’s worries are about a protracted stalemate, or even Russian successes leading to renewed offensives against the cities of Odesa, Kharkiv and Kyiv.  
Such mood swings can have important political consequences. They affect Ukrainian morale, already fragile after three gruelling months of war, and the attitudes of foreign supporters. The new pessimism encourages speculation about whether Kyiv might be persuaded to do a deal with Moscow after all — conceding some territory to Russia to gain relief from the horrors of war. But it also adds urgency to questions of arms supplies. A case in point is this week’s discussions in Washington about sending a multiple-launch rocket system to Ukraine. Concerns about how the Kremlin might respond to strikes deep into Russian territory using US weapons were soon balanced by the need to find Ukraine an answer to Russia’s current advantages in firepower.  
When the stakes are so high, and the pain often so great, it is natural to let the latest news from the fighting shape perspectives on the war. This is an unusually transparent war, but one learns only so much from social media posts and terse official communiqués. This is especially the case when trying to assess the importance of battles for individual villages or to establish if the belligerents are adapting their strategies to new circumstances and learning from past mistakes.  
To avoid these mood swings we need to keep in view the big picture: the structural factors that are shaping this conflict and will determine its eventual outcome. Step back and look at the Russian position. An enormous effort has gone into taking some extra land, with little spare capacity for dealing with tentative Ukrainian counteroffensives from Kharkiv to the north and towards Kherson in the south. Should they consolidate gains made in Luhansk, there is still much more to do to complete the takeover of Donetsk, which might enable Putin to claim a victory given how he framed this war at the start.   
Russia may find itself in charge of lands pummelled and deprived of infrastructure, with people who stayed hardly viewing the occupying forces as liberators. Recent gains must now be defended indefinitely against Ukrainian offensives. Behind the front lines Russian forces face ambushes and sabotaged supply lines. The enemy forces confronting them are fighting for their homeland and a national identity that Russia has sought to extinguish.  
Russian measures to persuade more men to serve in Ukraine are insufficient to make up for casualties and soldiers anxious to leave the army. Unlike Ukraine, Russia has yet to fully mobilise. Even if it did, it would be months before the extra numbers would make much difference. It depends on its own resources for fresh weapons — recently, vintage tanks have been brought into service. Moreover, Russian progress has been slow. Breakthroughs have not been effectively exploited. Some problems with inflexible tactics and command, evident in the war’s first phase, may not yet have been remedied.  
Ukraine is slowly but surely bringing modern western weapons into service. This takes time and is less than ideal because of the variety of systems, the need for training and the hazards of introducing them into the fight. Still, Ukraine will get stronger in coming months, especially in the area of long-range firepower. It is not going to rush. Volodymyr Zelensky recently explained that he would not follow Russia, “which throws people into hell of battles just because Moscow wanted to seize something in a few days or by a certain date”.  
As the war is unlikely to get any easier for Russia, it would not be surprising if Moscow floated suggestions that now is a good time for a ceasefire. But Zelensky will not agree to a permanent Russian occupation of 20 per cent of Ukrainian land. Putin might hope that a Russian offer would fracture the coalition of countries supporting Kyiv. But unless he is really optimistic about future military successes, his exhausted and depleted forces face being stuck in a hostile country that is growing in strength.",493c1f572c45ed82cf931c35f9902a51d1c692d8,True,False,,,,,0,1654344421,,0,{},ib50s6h,True,t3_v4nid0,False,True,t3_v4nid0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4nid0/time_favours_ukraine_in_its_grim_struggle_for/ib50s6h/,1654344433,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654315621.0,

If not; the implications of this thought process is that Macron believes even if/when this ends that Putin will just go back to normal status. I have a hard time believing that most humans around the world (not even counting people in Ukraine) don't have the expectation of war crimes trial for Putin at the very least.

A lot of the politicians and media get wrapped up in political talk like this and I guess in the political bubble that is normal. But from their luxury boxes they go too far and start harping on guessing Putin's latest red lines also and how everyone else has to jump or not in response to this.

But they never consider what Ukraine's red line is and behind that are millions of people across the globe (I would say the majority) of normal human beings that believe committing cruel atrocities on others is completely unacceptable ie those responsible must be held responsible.

This is the reason we have laws because if every psycopath was allowed to just go around doing this the whole civilization thing breaks down. It is just going too far for people to live with such a thing. It is not something people can adapt to ever.

The arrogance of some of these people in power is unbelievable. Putin #1 because he thought his army could do these things (encouraged it also with the butchers of Bucha getting awards) and have it all over the media and nobody would care. But people like Macron is a whole other type of arrogance, basically telling millions of people in Ukraine that their torture isn't even taken into consideration for anything.

Becasue last time Germany and France blocked us from NATO they told the same - oh, not now - you will not join any time soon, but you still have such right. This bs doesn't work. There must be concrete terms and criteria, not nice words and cheap replacements.

No, just complex since it it made up of words from many other languages. Example; Latin, French (Norman), Saxon, Anglo, Nordic languages of various flavours, etc. etc.

It's not difficult to understand the difference between ""tee"", the little stand used to put golf balls on (noun), or the act of starting to play a golf hole (verb) as in ""tee off"". Or to understand ""tea"" as in a drink made from dried leaves of *Camellia sinensis* and ""tea"" as in an afternoon meal of sandwiches, cakes and china cups of tea, to be sipped with the little pinky pointing upwards (not cups of *tees*).

Think of how many ways the syllable ""ough"" can be pronounced! 🤣🤣🤣

All their equipment, from D30 artillery, to BM21 MLRS, to infantry fighting vehicle BMPs and T72a3s were designed for regimental sized attacks.  These poke and prod single Battalion Tactical Group probing attacks with limited support, are not what that equipment was designed to do.

&gt;**Do you plan to go to Kyiv soon?**

&gt;I went there in February to try to avoid the war. Today, I am not ruling anything out. We have just taken a historic decision with the sixth package of sanctions with an embargo on 90% of Russian oil. We want to increase financial and military support to Ukraine. And finally, to do everything to get grain out of Ukraine. Ukrainians are fighting bravely, they deserve our support and respect.

&gt;**Arms deliveries to Ukraine continue. Six Caesar guns have been sent, but they were taken from French forces. Does this weaken us?**

&gt;These deliveries will be compensated. And I have asked our industrialists to accelerate the production of armaments, not only to replenish our stocks but also to strengthen our independence.

&gt;**There is talk of arms deliveries, and neighboring countries want to join NATO... Is there a risk of escalation?**

&gt;The situation is worrying, it is true. That's why I have put so much time and energy into it. I have lost count of the conversations I have had with Vladimir Putin since December. In all, about a hundred hours in transparency and at Zelinsky's request. We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels. I am convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power.

&gt;**What is your perception of Vladimir Putin?**

&gt;I think, and I have told him, that he has made a historic and fundamental mistake for his people, for himself and for history. Russia is still a great people. I think that he has isolated himself. To lock oneself in isolation is one thing, to know how to get out of it is a difficult path.

The best logistical efforts in the past have barely been able to keep that tempo without the rotation of fresh troops. I predicted a Korea scenario, years of combat in ebbs and flows with an eventual cease fire signed. This wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world, its better than your country getting crushed. If they kept 80 and Russia the 20 they have, it sucks, but yea to push past this point will be serious losses, without the use of heavier weapons you are talking about small arms combat, never good. The Russians can still manufacture ammo, albeit maybe not smart rounds but they can make artillery and small arms ammo, unguided bombs for aircraft, all that, easily, Tula does all of that and more. I think the world and allies on both sides will increasingly pressure them to settle this, its been clear that Nato will not confront Russia directly, so this open proxy war seems to be whats happening.

It will be a challenge to get ukraine soldiers to negotiate russian soldiers to cooperate. But it can happen

They can storm Russia, break into poopy's palace and arrest or kill not just him but any members of the kremlin. But their movements would be detected instantly n may make things harder unless another party was able to use this distraction to fly in quickly to poopy's location where that 2nd or 3rd party can break in and get him.

It might not work. But its the best way to over throw the government and find a worthy good successor that can end the war, as well as liberate russia and start making the  civilian economy not shit for once even tho it will take a few generations to get it right.

It would be better if Putler was arrested and sent to court for the whole world to see even his own people can get 100% confirmation that he's a lying sack of shit of a war criminal which can help change things around in russia along with a good successor of a government.

&gt; Details: According to Andriushchenko, after information was released about the bodies of those killed under the rubble, the occupiers began direct demolition of houses on 3 June without sorting through the rubble.

&gt; The first houses at 56-60 Unity Avenue were demolished under heavy guard with the involvement of &amp;quot;Volunteers&amp;quot;.

&gt; The Russians are destroying evidence without spending any more time searching for the dead in the wrecked houses, the mayor&amp;#039;s adviser points out.

Same goes for any nationality.

There are multiple high level officers from various countries (US, France, Germany, UK etc) who Said publicly that it is difficult for Ukraine right now, since the terrain is Harder to defend outside the big cities. Also, the ukrainians won't be able to use the delivered weapons to the same Level as the donator countries, simply because they have less experience on the systems and the supply chain is not there.

Some areas seem to be a bone mill for both Sides. This doesnt Take away anything from the ukrainians. They are fighting hard. And they are having more success than anticipated. But there is a reason ukrainian politicians ask for more at any door they knock: they are fighting for their survival. And they have inferior arms right now for the Battle that is done atm (their artillery is outranged and they have very few MLRS). Till they get Himars, Mars II etc, they are at a huge artillery range disadvantage, and even when delivered, russia will have the numbers Advantage (but losing the range Advantage).

From Wikipedia 

“…The Budapest Memorandum was negotiated at political level, but it is not entirely clear whether the instrument is devoid entirely of legal provisions. It refers to assurances, but it does not impose a legal obligation of military assistance on its parties.[1][27] According to Stephen MacFarlane, a professor of international relations, ""It gives signatories justification if they take action, but it does not force anyone to act in Ukraine.""[26]…”

But in this context of Russia…

“…Respect Belarusian, Kazakh and Ukrainian independence and sovereignty in the existing borders.[24]
Refrain from the threat or the use of force against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.
Refrain from using economic pressure on Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine to influence their politics.
Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine if they ""should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used"".
Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.
Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments.[20][25]…”

So it’s pretty clear Russia violated the agreement, but legally no one is forced to come to its defence. 

In essence the worlds nuclear superpowers agreed to not attack Ukraine if it gave up its nukes and it would retain its sovereignty.

Good luck getting any other countries to give up their nukes, and stopping others from rushing to get nukes.",b03ec45185cedbccfd7fa73bee7ba23186cfa52c,True,False,,,,,0,1654334575,,0,{},ib4q6jz,False,t3_v4gznq,False,True,t1_ib4pql8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4gznq/as_bizarre_it_may_sound_china_has_a_binding/ib4q6jz/,1654334588,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654305775.0,

Both camps are said to have suffered between 10,000 and 25,000 casualties and the number of wounded is at least twice as high, according to de Kruif.  That's more than Russians were killed in Afghanistan in the 1980s (about 15,000 according to Britannica) and - by comparison - about 50,000 Americans died in Vietnam in the 1960s (but over ten years, ed.).

This is not sustainable for Ukraine or Russia.  De Kruif thinks this phase can last from a few weeks to a maximum of two months and then evolve into a battle that is fought locally with much less intensity.

 Too early for diplomacy
What is striking is that neither side wants to make any concessions at the moment to enable a diplomatic solution.  Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky wants to push the Russians back to the situation before the February 24 invasion, but De Kruif does not seem very realistic.  The problem with this is that the Ukrainian population wants to push the Russians back much further than Zelensky and is increasingly thinking of an eventual victory.  They hope for the arrival of more heavy and sophisticated weapons from the West and they are indeed on the way.

De Kruif is considering a possible role of a third party that can mediate between the two fighters and specifically mentions China.  ""It used to be Russia's little brother, but now it's the other way around.""  For China, this conflict is very annoying and should not last too long.  The United States could then exert influence over Ukraine.

 De Kruif sees a possible end result in a situation where Russia would ""declare victory"" and Putin claims that he has ""linked the Donbas overland with previously conquered Crimea"", even though those goals are much less ambitious than the original ones.  The Ukrainians would then view their victory as having withstood the much larger Russian army.

 He does not think it is very realistic that international attention and that of the media will wane after a while.  The consequences of the war worldwide are too great for that and De Kruif mentions the potential famines, refugees, high energy prices and a possible economic recession.",52e02d533b715b43a87c89031291d3681e9e1506,True,False,,,,,0,1654331494,,0,{},ib4n92t,True,t3_v4khw0,False,True,t3_v4khw0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4khw0/according_to_a_retired_dutch_lieutenant_general/ib4n92t/,1654331511,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654302694.0,

The economist Peter Zeihan made a video about the war in February or March, where he went over Russia's weakness due to declining population.

Stop pretending that you have fulfilled your commitments. You have not. No matter how much obsolete gear you sold or donated or how many pensions you have to pay. 2 % target has been there for long time and you only started to work for it when Trump said US has to reconsider article 5 for those who are freeloading. Trump was a disaster as a leader but Trump has something in common with Germany. It all about deals, business and economy for Trump and Germany. Trump understood that NATO was a bad deal for US when US spent 4-5% and Germany (among other countries) just barely above 1%. By the way that 2% is YOUR holy number, it's your commitment. Countries that are not in NATO can spend what ever % they like or stop spending at all. Although every country has an army, if it's not your own, it's your invaders army.

And stop saying that there was no threat. You just closed your eyes from the threat's. 2022 Ukraine attack is not the 1st attack Russia has made after collapse of Soviet union. There is actually so many agressions Russia has made that it forms a pattern. But it seems that you don't give a shit about your allies (who shares borders with Russia) and consider NATO as a beneficial business deal for your country. Just like Germany is starting to propose rebuilding of Ukraine, that would be beneficial for Germany's economy just like cheap Russian oil and gas or keeping the donations low in % of GDP. Your economy is your top 1 priority above everything else.

The amount of damage Germany has taken to its diplomatic status /PR is staggering. Still you keep justifying your actions (maybe more to your self than for others?) When the dust settles, I'm sure new alliances will be formed. Where Germany few other central European countries seem to share the same values, it seems that USA+UK+North Europe + East Europe share the same values. No wonder UK saw the true colors of EU lead by Germany and France and left.

Why do you think genocide was defined the way it was at the Geneva Convention? Do you think the outlines against bodily or mental harm, inflicting conditions of life to destroy, limiting birth, or forcibly relocating children were hypothetical? These definitions were written specifically because genocidal regimes do not limit themselves to mass murder through bombing campaigns.  

&gt;You also need to remember that a significant amount of the people in that region are ethnically Russian, consider themselves to be Russian, literally voted in a referendum that they'd rather be governed by Russia, and may consider this alleged ""act of genocide"" to actually be a liberation from their status as second class citizens under a fascist puppet state.

Oh of course. That's why the deportations are strictly voluntary. That's why ethnic Ukranians and Crimean Tatars have been scattered across Russia as far as Siberia.

&gt; I get that you guys really want to show everyone how much you hate Russians, I hate Russia too, but accusations of genocide are really fucking serious and its insulting to people who were victims of actual genocides in the past and present.  

You think people hate Russia why, exactly? Because they're holding peace parades? You know what's insulting to victims of genocide? Trying to say their definition of genocide is inadequate.  

&gt;If this incident is legally considered to be an act of genocide, then the Ukrainian state has been engaging in a genocide since at least 2014 and the US has a whole list of genocides to explain in the terror wars.  

Oh I'm sorry, I had no idea there was a ""They did it first"" clause in the Geneva Convention. But sure, the ones calling Russian actions genocide are the ones insulting victims of genocide.

•	500 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Both deliveries were decided by the German government only a few days after the start of the war and were delivered to Ukraine within a few days. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger
•	2053 short-range surface-to-air missiles of the type Strela-2. The delivery of the weapons from GDR production, which were still in storage with the Bundeswehr, was decided at the beginning of March and delivered in the weeks thereafter. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K32_Strela-2

•	500 pieces of breech 7.62 mm for MG3
•	500 pieces spare tube 7.62 mm for MG3
•	5100 anti-tank handguns of the type RGW-90. The modern anti-tank weapons, which are used by the Bundeswehr under the name of Matador, were purchased by Ukraine directly from the manufacturer and were delivered to Ukraine in two tranches from the end of March, following export approval by the German government. https://dn-defence.com/rgw-90/
•	1600 anti-tank directional mines of the type KN57 DM22
•	3000 anti-tank mines of the type KN55 DM31


These promised deliveries are still outstanding:


•	30 Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks and around 60,000 pieces of ammunition. According to plans, the first of a total of 15 Gepard systems from  15 Gepard systems from German industry stocks are to arrive in Ukraine in July. Another 15 are to follow in the course of the summer. The Ukrainian crews of the tanks will be trained in Germany at Bundeswehr firing ranges by trainers from the manufacturer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flakpanzer_Gepard
•	4 Mars II multiple rocket launchers from Bundeswehr stocks, these are to be delivered to Ukraine by the end of June, according to government sources. The Bundeswehr has a total of 22 of the missile launchers. https://www.kmweg.de/systeme-produkte/kettenfahrzeuge/artillerie/mars-ii-mlrs-e/
•	7 self-propelled howitzers of the type PzH 2000 . Delivery of the heavy artillery gun, which is mounted on a tank chassis, will probably begin in July. The delivery was decided at the beginning of May. At that time, the Netherlands had asked Berlin whether they could send five German-made howitzers to Ukraine. The German government then decided to put together a larger package and deliver seven systems. Ukrainian soldiers are currently being trained on the howitzer in Germany, but this is taking somewhat longer than initially hoped because of the complexity of the technology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerhaubitze_2000
•	Iris-T air defence system. The delivery was decided only a few days ago, Scholz announced it in the Bundestag on Wednesday. Ukraine had already requested the air defence system from the German manufacturer Diehl Defence in Berlin at the beginning of May, but a corresponding application for export was only approved a few days ago. According to the manufacturer, the system offers protection against attacks by aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and short-range ballistic missiles. The delivery to Ukraine, however, will take several more months and will probably not take place until late autumn or winter. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIS-T
•	Cobra radars. Not much is known about the details of the delivery. However, it is presumably also a direct purchase by Ukraine from the German arms industry. According to the Bundeswehr, Cobra is the world’s most powerful artillery tracking radar. The main task of the system is the precise localisation of enemy artillery, rockets and mortars. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-battery_radar

By late May Canada had received 260,000 temporary (3 year) visas under the CUAET program.  Over 120,000 visas have already been approved.  There is no cap on the number of CUAET visas that Canada will authorize.  Since January more than 35,000 people have arrived in Canada from Ukraine.

The gist of the post was that they figured out russia or Putin religious watches foreign media outlets like CNN and appears to use that for their strategy. 

So then a general appeared on CNN which seemed to be saying things which were obviously not true, but in favour of Russians advantage to taking this city. How they had the upper hand etc. 

So Putin entered the kill box.

Using this lens reading other articles, you can see how the US are saying in public this is a stalemate, a years long drawn out war no side has advantage etc. 

Which strikes me as untrue. Ukrainians have a 3 or 4 to one kill rate, are holding the line and when the NATO weapons systems enter the fight in a month or two the playing field will absolutely change along with failing moral and equipment losses on Russian side.

1\] Russia's lost more equipment in this war than the arsenals of Germany, France, and Britain combined.   It's absolutely fucking insane.  Just to use tanks as a point of comparison, those nations have 240, 400, and 400 respectively, and I'm rounding up.   Russia's lost 1300.  Russia says they have 3500 or so.

Which sounds pretty bad, but also:

2\] *Russia (the Russian Federation, particularly) didn't build those tanks.*

The absolute ""what the fuck"" moment here is that almost the entirety of Russia's arsenal ... *is Soviet tanks!   They were built 50 years ago!*   It sounds fucking insane, but signs point to a reality where Russia manufactures almost no new tanks.

So for starters, we have to consider the ""new models"".  They've had several programs throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, wherein they've designed new tank variants and built roughly a dozen of each, per decade.  During the 90s, Russia had a legitimate financial collapse, so they couldn't produce.  During the aughts, things got weird.

They ended up doing refurbs instead.  The Kleptocracy decided it was way more profitable to just draw from their soviet-era reserves of T-72s (the 1972 model) and refit them with modern gear like digital video feeds (often with thermal imaging — which acts as a combo of night-vision but also anti-infantry-ambush vision), and modern comms systems.  Now, Russia does have an arms industry, where they export a lot of tanks (typically the T-72 model) to foreign militaries like Iraq, India, etc.   You would expect in a normal situation like the German arms industry, that they'd have been building new instances of an old-fashioned, designed-to-be-cheap model like the T-72, for export.

But ... normally a military saves their good kit for domestic use, and what they've been using *domestically* seems to be really bad.   Most of the tanks being blown up in Ukraine are observably really old ones that were dragged out of storage, and refurbed.   Were a lot of their exports actually refurbs with the rust buffed off, as well?  Who knows.

There's a lot classified shit I don't know from what's going on inside Russia, but the ""externally visible"" facts suggest they're sending a ""representative sample"" of their equipment into Ukraine, and that most of their gear is refurbished rather than new, which has alarming implications for their manufacturing capability.   (search for some videos by Perun on youtube if you'd like something to back this up, as the moderation bots on this sub tend to auto-block any video links I'd embed myself).

\-----

If their manufacturing capability is genuinely THAT bad, and if, as appearances suggest, the vast majority of their (extremely large) arsenal is actually Soviet made and not Russian-Federation made, it may take an obscenely long amount of time to replace what they've lost.

They still have a surprising amount, *perhaps even a majority* of their arsenal left, but what they've lost is **alarming**.",dbcb8b9c8fead693845f692b9297d8c99033d329,True,False,,,,,0,1654313199,,0,{},ib41ivo,False,t3_v48hrn,False,True,t1_ib3luye,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v48hrn/russia_wanted_to_take_all_of_luhansk_first_and/ib41ivo/,1654313215,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654284399.0,

No, they don't.  
Because aggregated alternatives can not be automatically disaggregated into individual ones.  
  
Representative democracy could adequately represent the majority will in at most 1-3 issues over the election cycle, at best.  
  
US DoD annual reports on global threats have since Obama government emphasized that mass migrations and AGW are global threat multipliers. But curiously one cannot find even a single party among any OECD member states which would simultaneously support a combination of restricting mass immigration AND supporting a globally equal carbon tax with WTO adjustment tariffs and with full citizen dividends (Nordhaus's and James Hansen's Tax &amp; Dividend), even though the majority will of the citizenry has been behind both for decades already. The crosstabulation of scientific and public positions against that of the parties suggests an arbitrage (a dilemma for voters) at higher than 6-sigma significance (with chi-square test or similar) to systematically avert democracy on an industrial scale. Such a situation could not have happened in democracies - which conclusively proves at 6-sigma statistical significance that liberal democracies (without Swiss-style referendums) are an oxymoron.  
  
And that is especially evident in avoiding referendums on such (or on any) issues.",e9f4bb0f971e65bae91883ef7dd23099a1d6dd5a,True,False,,,,,0,1654312605,,0,{},ib40li1,False,t3_v45kiu,False,True,t1_ib3zugr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v45kiu/is_breaking_up_russia_the_only_way_to_end_its/ib40li1/,1654312617,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654283805.0,

&gt; Poland&amp;#039;s prime minister has, during a visit to Kyiv, criticised western European countries for failing to speak out against Russia&amp;#039;s mass deportation of people from Ukraine.

&gt; Morawiecki noted Poles&amp;#039; own traumatic experience of deportations to Siberia at the hands of Russia and the Soviet Union in the past.

&gt; Last month, Ukraine&amp;#039;s human rights ombudsman claimed that almost 1.2 million Ukrainians have been deported to Russia, including over 200,000 children.

My comment clearly was in response to Gorbachev's assertion that the US was essentially only interested in projecting raw power in using the atomic bomb. 

If you deny that dropping the bombs was *a* cause at all of Japan's surrender, I would remind you that Truman had prior knowledge that the Soviets were about to enter the Pacific theater against Japan.  He also knew that they planned to do so around the same time as Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki.  We also know, from the historical record, that Stalin had been aware of the Manhattan Project for quite some time before it came to fruition at Hiroshima, and that he reportedly (from Truman himself) expressed hope that we make good use of it against Japan.  Thus, it is quite possible that there was some degree of coordination of efforts.  Dropping the bomb might have even been a condition precedent for the Soviets to enter theater.  I am not sure how much coordination there was, but there was certainly a plethora of backchannel communication between the two powers.

&gt;US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters earlier this week that the Italian framework is “one of those initiatives that we certainly would love to see bring a conclusion to this horrific war and the horrific attacks on the Ukrainian people.” But two US officials told CNN that the US actually does not support the Italian proposal.

**2.**

&gt;For now, that effective stalemate presents an opportunity for the US to slowly bleed Russia of both blood and treasure, multiple military officials said. But the longer the conflict drags on, the higher the costs for the West – and the greater the challenge the Biden administration will face in [supplying Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/ukraine-assistance-biden/index.html), finding sustainable replacements for Russian oil and gas, and keeping an already-fractious European alliance committed to its strategy.

And a global social contract can only stand on local ones. A local social contract is only as stable as its constituents, which requires lack of mass immigration. That is Game Theory 101. 
  
Rank correlation between [biocapacity deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint) and [share of immigrants in a country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population) is statistically significantly negative, which means that mass immigration destroys local natural environment.  
  
Any immigration rate faster than the assimilation rate is unsustainable in the long run. Assimilation rate depends on the ratio of natives versus the ratio of non-natives and vice versa - therefore a 67% native country is able to assimilate newcomers 6x slower than a 90% native country. A sustainable assimilation rate is about 0,1% annually (with respect to the number of natives), but only if the share of natives is at least 90%. In a 67% native country the sustainable assimilation rate is below 0,017% annually. And the natives are not defined as EU citizens or citizens of USA, but as multi-generational citizens of individual EU member states or of individual states of US - therefore intra-EU migration counts as part of the overall migration.  
  
US DoD annual reports on global threats have since Obama government emphasized that mass migrations and AGW are global threat multipliers. But curiously one cannot find even a single party among OECD member states which would simultaneously support a combination of restricting mass immigration AND supporting a globally equal carbon tax with WTO adjustment tariffs and with full citizen dividends (Nordhaus's and James Hansen's Tax &amp; Dividend), even though the majority will of the citizenry is behind both. The crosstabulation of scientific and public positions against that of the parties suggests an arbitrage at higher 6-sigma significance (with chi-square test or similar) to systematically avert democracy on an industrial scale.

&gt;For now, that effective stalemate presents an opportunity for the US to slowly bleed Russia of both blood and treasure, multiple military officials said. But the longer the conflict drags on, the higher the costs for the West – and the greater the challenge the Biden administration will face in [supplying Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/ukraine-assistance-biden/index.html), finding sustainable replacements for Russian oil and gas, and keeping an already-fractious European alliance committed to its strategy.

&gt;I’ve said before that the Azov movement, or just that shorthand ‘Azov,’ is one of the most widely discussed yet poorly understood far-right movements in the world. I’d describe the movement like this: it’s a multi-pronged, heterogeneous far-right social movement that grew out of its namesake military unit, the Azov Regiment, and exert at least some influence on Ukrainian politics and society despite its small numbers (e.g., at most 20,000 members estimated at some points in the past). It continues, even during the current invasion, to evolve and grow and adapt, and is probably one of the most PR-savvy far-right movements I’ve ever seen.

Exactly - which why it is pointless to use it as an argument.  
  
&gt; Don't forget that this is really the first time that Russia and NATO has conflicted, albeit indirectly, on European soil.  
  
I am quite sure relations were tense also in 1956, 1968 and at other times.  
  
&gt; Most of the old-school advisors can't let go of the nuclear factor in their decision-making.  
  
What is ever-present is not a deciding factor. It cancels out.  
  
&gt; However, all they need to do is create fear and doubt among NATO countries for it to became a factor in their decision-making.  
  
Well, that is what you are doing here.  
  
&gt; This is also why Germany has been foot-dragging, France has been talking about giving Russia a way out, and why the US still won't give certain weapons to Ukraine.  
  
No, I don't think that the behavior of Germany nor France could be explained by that.  
The only credible nuclear threat assessment may come from USA.  
  
&gt; This is also why Germany has been foot-dragging, France has been talking about giving Russia a way out, and why the US still won't give certain weapons to Ukraine.  
  
I disagree vehemently. There is a very large manouvering room between the present reality and NATO boots in Ukraine.  
  
&gt; The difference is that some NATO countries are willing to accept a higher level of risk than others.

12.9m is easily a tier 2 city. China only has 6 cities bigger than that and 4 are tier 1. So the vast majority of tier 2 cities are smaller than Moscow. 

Secondly the Pearl River Area is huge. It features 2 of the biggest cities in China, along with Hong Kong, Macao and multiple other tier 2 and tier 3 cities. They are developed together because they're all so close to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. It's not one of many run of the mill little areas with 78 million people. 

I'm less familiar with India but based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_India_by_population) it doesn't have a single city bigger than Moscow. But Mumbai is bigger if you include all the surrounding areas which is sort of cheating.

It could be something slightly different though, just spitballing here: it could be that Ukraine is sensing that [Russia is almost out of logistical oomph](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uceil8/russia_loses_last_hope_to_scare_the_world_off/i6c5024/) and set out to make them bleed through the last of what they have in the morass of an urban battle.

Except it didn't.  The Japanese government weren't willing to ""unconditionally"" surrender, even after both nukes were dropped.  They correctly perceived the weapons to be no more devastating than the firebombing of Tokyo.  What actually triggered the Japanese capitulation was the entry of the Soviet Union against the Japanese.  Japanese holdings in Manchuria collapsed against the Red Army, and they decided it would be worse to be under Soviet hegemony, rather than US hegemony.   Also, secretly, the Truman administration had backed out of their ""unilateral"" surrender position, and there were negotiations between intermediates.  Finally, even with the Emperor and the cabinet willing to cave, the Japanese ""unconditional"" surrender almost did not come about, because Japanese Army coups were a common feature in Japanese politics of the era.  What made the a-bombs ""useful"" towards the Japanese surrender were their eventual mythologization as the motivation for the Japanese surrender.

Finally, most of the world public just doesn't grasp is that there are even more devastatingly inhumane ways to exterminate huge populations, such as starving them to death using a naval blockade.",f0578410833c47103659882511d84c2b6a49cad8,True,False,,,,,0,1654301206,,0,{},ib3hdkf,False,t3_v3xw30,False,True,t1_ib1v9jx,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v3xw30/imagine_freeing_hundreds_of_millions_of_people/ib3hdkf/,1654301221,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654272406.0,
