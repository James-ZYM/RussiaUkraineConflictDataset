[],False,,PPStudio,,,,,,"Note: Comment was removed due to Wikipedia links, so I've remade i without them. I don't see the problem with Wikipedia as a source hub of sorts, but hey I'm okay with it not being considered a reliable source. 

I'll try to be short, but it's somewhat hard because the problem with left and pseudo-left is vast and complex in Ukraine. I say pseudo-left because what remains after the fall of Soviet regime and was born out of it hardly could be categorized as left. The Communist Part of Ukraine was officially prohibited twice as of now: first in the 1990's, then in 2010's after the war started and Russia took Crimea and sponsored/supported DPR and LPR. The term ""denazification"" as used by Russia might be an answer to ""decommunization"" here, which is, to be honest, not a prohibition of left ideologies, but rather and attempt to finally bury the ever-present Soviet past. There was a Vladimir Lenin statue practically in every major city (often two or more) and since 2014 most of those were either destroyed by population or dismantled officially. Russia attempts to be a successor of USSR so it very much used all of that in their media as ""Evil Nazis vs. Good Communists"" rhetoric. Instead of using formal symbology of USSR which would be too blatant they attempt to use more neutral World War II connections (hence ribbon of Saint George, 1940's Soviet uniform and elements), cultural symbols and assorted dog whistles of shared Soviet past.  
As for our party system in general: back in the 1990's there were a lot of emerging parties: a Socialist one was formed in place of Communist one (and still remained there for some reason after latter was restored), a ton of parties positioned themselves as Social-Democratic in order to take the best of two worlds in elections and there was a more or less prominent Green Party. By 2000's there were too many parties so they've started to form blocs, mainly because several times there was an ineffective parliament which was not able to form a coalition (and latter was superimportant as without forminf one parliament is automatically reelected in Ukraine). Green Party was slowly assimilated into ""Our Ukraine"" bloc lead by then-presidential candidate and later president Viktor Yushchenko. That said, most of the bloc leaderships have astounding similarities in their background: they've started their political careers in USSR and therefore were pretty much cut of the same cloth, only differing in slight corrections to populist rhetoric. People who announced themselves as liberals on paper essentially had little to no difference from conservatives somehow, muddling and regrouping as soon as they were elected.  
The values of USSR are incredibly interchangeable with fundamentalist orthodox Christianity which was and still is a switch at play. Therefore, ironically, values of a lot of post-Soviet parties (in the sense of being formed from people who come from Soviet establishment) are curiously more in line with right. That doesn't make them in the same boat as far-right since latter share a unanimous resentment of anything Soviet, but there are shady things going on behind the scenes and there are odd connections between certain leaders. Dmytro Korchynsky and Illia Kyva should be on the opposites of the spectrum and yet they share a certain history together.

  
Situation started to shift again after Maidan revolution in 2014. Parliamentary elections of that year were the first in years when we had a lot of parties again and these parties had chances against blocs, as well as new faces. 2019 elections might seem as a downgrade in comparison, especially since we have what is often called a mono-majority taken by Servant of the People. But Servant of the People is incredibly centrist so a lot of people that had no chances on previous elections decided it complies with their views enough to go in the parliament under them. It's been three years and I still can't categorize this party as left or right monolithically since it's really neither and yet has a bit of both. It's really not much of a party as it is ""let's take over and see who we are afterwards"". There are quite a few ecological activists easily categorized as Green by their actions and overall there were some serious shifts regarding ecology under that parliament.

  
Moreover... We only now really start to form political movements or even understanding what is liberal Left. For thirty years ""left"" and ""communist"" were synonyms and both were associated with a complex, problematic past that has way more in common with right and/or militarist dictatorships and/or corruption galore. And, last but not least, this past was traumatic. Progressive, liberal or otherwise different leftists are struggling to form identity of their own and don't want to use anything associated with Soviet regime, opting for very neutral symbols or those associated with LGBTQ (the easiest way to not be associated with mainstream left and right, equally), which in Russia is somehow associated with Nazis since at least 2000's. Anarchist underground... Exists somewhere and is not having Russia but never quite announces its existence formally. Same with Antifa (real one), which is (as everywhere in the world ) not much of a movement bound by similar political ideology as it is a group of people sharing a resentment to specific right ones. It seems to be formed sporadically by leftists, centrists and right. There are also neo-marxists who, yet again, are not fond of Soviet past and attempt to rebuild the ideology from scratch. Those are mostly found in the academia rather than active political circles.",fd9720e788f4a969e1e6adc205b4e7cfedb18ad8,True,False,,,,,0,1647820616,,0,{},i1gvpcf,True,t3_tic13h,False,True,t1_i1gemlk,/r/geopolitics/comments/tic13h/appropriation_and_misdirection_in_the_war_between/i1gvpcf/,1647820628,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647791816.0,[],text,t2_q0b8f,False,False

[],False,,Sri_Mazdamundi,,,,,,"&gt;exceptionally rare you read about india in the news

Then your post should be titled about lack of india in news.

It would be more accurate.

India doesn't make headlines because for many reasons.

1)West centric news in western countries.
This is expected and obvious.
The west cares about happenings in china due to its economic size and competitiveness vis a vis the west.
Additionally west is not curious about india and still has images from the 90's or so when they think of india.


2) India doesn't make its stance on global issues public or take a partisan stance that would attract notice from Western audience.
Take the recent russia Ukraine conflict for instance.
Indo-russian relationship is going strong for many decades but is now in public scrutiny because of recent events.
In the western lens, India's neutrality is itself seen as a partisan stance and against western interests and thus the discussion.

 3)India's interests are primarily in its neighbourhood which include nations which also don't figure in western narrative and discourse.
In the neighbouring countries india has a reputation of being invasive wrt political happenings for instance.
Of late India has appeared in Western discourse as a part of quad.
India has had worse relationship with china for decades before the west and Chinese relationship went downhill.
But India's role as a counter to west is being talked about as China's role in the world has increased.

4)India's economic size is still too small to shape global events unilaterally.


But by no means is India irrelevant.
If it were then the US wouldn't give statements saying russo indian relationship is distinct form russo American relationship.
https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/india-russia-relations-distinct-from-washington-equation-with-moscow-thats-okay-us-ukraine-1918199-2022-02-26

For US State department to make such statements is a big deal especially since we're living in the days when dogshows are banning russians from completing.

Australian High commissioner also made a similar statement
https://m.timesofindia.com/india/quad-accepted-indias-russia-stand-wont-hit-ties-australian-high-commissioner/amp_articleshow/90341223.cms


This clearly demonstrates that their long term priority remains china and to deal with china they need India.

But it doesnt mean there's no pressure or expectations as we can see in Whitehouse spox statement:

It's no secret that India is a developing country in both a social and an economic sense and thus it has to deal with a barrage of issues such as poverty, malnutrition, gender disparity, caste inequality, religious bigotry, communal sectarianism and so on. 

And although there's no doubt that majoritarianism and populism are on the rise in India but that's not something that the average person in the West is necessarily worried about because...well they don't live in India and it's not really their concern as such. 

What does concern them is India's foreign policy, which I do think has been rather benign. During the Cold War, India refused to align itself either the US or the USSR. Even today India refuses to pick sides between the US and China in what can be termed as Cold War 2.0. 

India's non-alignment is the reason why it maintains good ties with countries that are hostile to each other but friendly to India such as the US and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, South Korea and North Korea, Israel and Palestine, and so on.

[],False,,Objective-Injury-687,,,,,,"&gt;Fast forward three decades later, the US's GDP is $22 trillion while Japan's stagnated at that same figure of $5 trillion

A lot of this has to do with Japan's unique situation both demographically and culturally. Japanese people are some of the longest lived in the entire world and Japan has a strong culture of caring for your elders. This means two things, the first is that the elderly are a drag on the economy much longer than in the rest of the world, and second that Japan spends more of its GDP on healthcare than most other countries. It also means that more and more of the money that *would* have gone to growth instead goes to taking care of its elderly. 

Because of this Japan's economy has stalled and is actually starting to backside because of the non existant birth rate. Japan borrowed its way out of the backslide for a while which is why it has the highest debt to GDP ratio in the world, but it's ability to do that is rapidly diminishing.


&gt;there is a good case to be made that China will soon peak in GDP at around $15-$16 trillion

Considering China is already at $15 trillion in GDP its pretty unlikely it would stop exactly at this moment.  Also China has less debt, more natural resources, and a much, much larger industrial and corporate sector. China will have to grapple with a shrinking population in the next 25-40 years but, it will still be one of the most populous countries on Earth giving it much more leeway in how it goes forward.

China being a planned economy also gives it much more freedom in how it responds to crises that free and open market countries like Japan and the US have. It's possible that China's economy could stall, though I don't think it will stall any time in the near future, but if it does it won't be for the same reasons that Japan's did. It will be because of some change in the status quo that robs China of its greatest economic asset, it's cheaply made export goods.",77451446863caa89e446b369cb9293b62f234bb0,True,False,,,,,0,1647809911,,0,{},i1g7620,False,t3_tihnba,False,True,t1_i1feiut,/r/geopolitics/comments/tihnba/why_is_india_so_irrelevant_globally/i1g7620/,1647809924,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647781111.0,[],text,t2_88sf9r0e,False,False

It isn't new either. Companies like Nintendo, Sony, Toyota, Hyundai and Samsung have had huge cultural impacts on the Western world for decades, despite being based in Japan or South Korea.

North American multi-culturalism has also further integrated Japanese and Korean cultures into Western culture. Plenty of white or black people are nostalgic about Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh.

We probably do need a new term to replace ""West"" in that context. 

Interestingly, while current events, or possible future conflicts (like a War over Taiwan) could change things, we have been seeing more integration of China into Western culture, over the years. The CCP has tried to keep a bit of an artificial cap on it, but the effect of common culture is a side-effect of global trade. Hong Kong is obviously highly Westernized, as is Taiwan. Chinese cultural products like Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies have made an impact in the West, while China has been the world's second largest market for Hollywood films, going the other way. Tencent seems like it owns stakes in half the Western video game companies, while Western games like Warcraft and League of Legends are huge hits in China.

The lack of open internet access, and the use of CCP censoring affects the extent of Western cultural integration, but, ironically, it works both ways. The more China's 1.4B people interact with the West, the more they put their own imprint on Western culture, so by putting artificial walls around the ability of Chinese citizens to interact with the West, the CCP keeps more control of its internal culture, but also limits China's overall impact on the West, at the same time.

As long as China maintains that artificial bubble around itself, it will never be able to extend it's own cultural impact past its own borders in a meaningful way in order to challenge or shape Western culture.",a95bba8f574f1ceeb30c0cb504b7ac58d6407065,True,False,,,,,0,1647807088,,0,{},i1g0j8u,False,t3_tiiq1q,False,True,t1_i1fm19t,/r/geopolitics/comments/tiiq1q/do_you_think_there_will_be_a_shift_in_the_world/i1g0j8u/,1647807099,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647778288.0,[],text,t2_1hfhp15q,False,False

The soft power of a country's economic might is much more frequently used than hard power in power projection, but also the power of your military is usually also dependent on the power of your economy which funds it.

India still has an economy smaller than the UK or Germany, and a whole lot more of India's $2.59T in GDP goes to just feed it's massive population than the amount used by the UK's $2.63T in GDP to feed theirs.

China has a GDP that is more than 5 times the size of India's, making it far more relevant on the world stage.

It is a shame because India really should be where modern day China is, or, optimistically, even where countries like Japan and South Korea are. Western businesses would have loved to have invested capital in the largely English speaking, democratically governed country over China. Unfortunately, India's close relations with the Soviets during the Cold War, and lingering anti-Western sentiment (partially due to negative feelings from British colonial times) held them back. They also haven't had the foresight to put in place the necessary policies to allow it to compete internationally. It still has high levels of illiteracy (affecting their ability to make use of their massive workforce), it has had lots of issues with corruption over the years, and infrastructure investment levels haven't been high enough.

India is even more poorly understood than China, partly because the language barrier is lower. India's problems are quite varied and deep, and most people in West will be shocked by the ideas that are common currency even among the so-called middle class. A few points:

Incidentally, this is the same state from which Gandhi came, but he was murdered by ""the ideological family"" of those in power now.

\- Situation of minorities is so dire that genocidewatch recently issued a [warning](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/genocide-warning-india) warning about the bloodthirsty rhetoric that's reaching Rwanda-like levels.

\- India is definitely not seen as benign by any of its neighbors, just as Russia's neighbors--as the world is now finding out--always kept a wary eye on it.

\- India has hundreds of millions of English speaking commentators (aka trolls) on social media and anything critical of India's rightwing march will be downvoted to oblivion in hours, so many people, including the likes of [Salman Rushdie](https://scroll.in/article/768430/salman-rushdie-on-the-bihar-results-twitter-trolls-and-india-as-a-hindu-nation), Arundhati Roy, Pankaj Mishra and other intellectuals don't even bother with social media. On Western media platforms like nytimes.com, you can check comments on any story critical of the ""manly"" current authoritarian Prime Minister and you will find no shortage of articulate rhetoricians who will attempt to explain away any savagery. This comment too will be downvoted shortly :)

[],False,,TypingMonkey59,,,,,,"One of the most striking features of western discussion on the war in Ukraine is the widespread assumption, usually presented without any meaningful argument, that the war either is or will inevitably become an exact reflection of America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The alleged parallels are twofold: firstly, that the goal of Russia's invasion is to enact regime change, just as America sought to do in its wars in the middle east; and secondly, that such an attempt at regime change will inevitably mire Russia in a lengthy insurgency which will greatly drain its resources and outlast the Russian invaders—again, just as America's wars turned out.

While I understand that there are arguments in favor of these possibilities and accept them as such, there is simply not enough evidence to justify the certainty with which most people make these assertions. Rather, it seems that peoples' understanding of war has been so thoroughly warped by two decades of America's failed interventions in the middle east they are unable to imagine that a war might have different aims than regime change and different results than an unbeatable insurgency movement.

Regarding the aims of the invasion, I don't believe that regime change is one of them. The Russians have made quite clear from the beginning, and even before the war, that their demands are neutrality, demilitarization, “denazification”, and the recognition of Crimea and the Donbass as Russian territory/independent republics. Russia would likely prefer to achieve these objectives through a peace deal, and they have signalled that they'd be fine with letting Zelensky remain as president, but they might opt for regime change if Kiev won't make the desired concessions.

Should this come to pass, remember that not all instances of one population being occupied by another have yielded insurrectionist movements. Germany and Japan, for instance, were under foreign occupation by Allied troops for years following WWII without any insurgency movements resulting from it. Granted, you can say that these are special cases which are unlikely to be repeated in Ukraine, but I'm only pointing out possibilities here and we won't know for certain until the war is over.

If insurgency does arise, remember also that not all counterinsurgency is not doomed to fail, and here Chechnya is the salient example. While the early years of the Chechen wars were plagued by Russian failures, they eventually got their act together and, working in tandem with their Chechen collaborators, brought about the end of the Chechen insurgency to mantain their hold over the republic. Should Russia face an insurgency in Ukraine, they will doubtless make use of the lessons learned from dealing with the Chechens. Obviously there are points of difference that could make a Ukrainian insurgency more difficult to deal with, such as support from western states, but they may be counterbalanced by other points which make it more easily dealt with, such as greater cultural similarities and a flatter terrain.",75e3f7ee5bec23895f5eaf2f17c3b57b054fdd2a,True,False,,,,,0,1647798309,,0,{},i1ffseg,False,t3_t020va,False,False,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i1ffseg/,1647798328,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647769509.0,[],text,t2_q2rnh4c,False,False

Europe's opinion on how to pursue them diverges with America's a lot more than serious interests do. 

Loo, Iraq was a US mistake, especially going against the Security Council and other major allies. There are times the US might have to go against the Security Council, but it will always be costly. Iraq wasn't worth it. Still, if that is the high water mark for US unipolar hubris during its unipolar moment, that really isn't too bad as these things go. The US was far from totally alone, and Iraq was basically begging to be slapped down. It's not like the US just invaded and annexed Mexico because it wanted to, or anything. So hopefully the US and Europe can put the past behind them and find more common ground again in the future.

# EUROPEAN UNION

&gt; Are pro-mutinist formations and politicians now bankrupt in the European Union? Irreversible?
&gt;
&gt; In the coming months, such formations will be in retreat in the EU. In France, if Marine Le Pen enters the second round of the presidential election - which would be the most convenient for Emmanuel Macron - he will get a whip for his love for Putin.
&gt; 
&gt; Matteo Salvini, as evidenced by his reaction to the President of Przemyśl being presented with Putin's T-shirt, would like to run away and forget how he praised Putin. 
&gt; 
&gt; And you can get away from it at all?
&gt; 
&gt; Many people would now like to escape from their fascination with Putin, because people in Europe see images of war and death, which are Putin's fault. Everyone sees the one-sidedness of his aggression. Any arguments that Ukraine posed a threat to Russia are nonsense. Nobody will believe that Zelenskiy is a neo-Nazi. How could a Jew, whose family was largely lost in the Holocaust, be a Nazi? How could Zelenskiy, who grew up in the culture of the Russian language, want to attack Russia? After all, this is the Kremlin's propaganda madness.
&gt; 
&gt; Proputinist politicians - I repeat - will be in retreat in the coming months, but if the war continues for a long time, then - unfortunately - knowing the nature of people, especially those who are fed up in Europe, we will be occupied with other topics, and the war will be relegated to the background. We can become indifferent - this is a great risk.

# POLAND

&gt; The PiS government is returning to the West?
&gt; 
I hope. Today, everyone is aware that we need more unity, because in the face of such conflicts no one can handle it on his own. I think it will weaken anti-European aspirations and stop ideas of breaking up the EU or imitating Brexit, because it would be suicidal.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you see the reset when it comes to Poland's position in the EU?
&gt; 
&gt; This reset is a fact of life. Information is spreading around the world that over 2 million refugees have already arrived in Poland and they are finding help - people are already waiting at the border with food and offer a roof over their heads. It is the open heart of Poles that builds the image of Poland as a country of solidarity. The help that Poles bring to refugees makes a colossal impression in the West. It must also be said here that in a similar vein there is talk of Slovaks or Romanians, but of course the most refugees are in our country.
&gt; 
&gt; After the reset, however, the system returns to its previous stability.
&gt; 
&gt; Social and political resets are not like computer and phone resets. The change has come and nothing will ever be the same as it was before this war. All the while, let's hope it doesn't extend westward. In worse scenarios, Western Ukraine will also be engulfed in war. There is also a risk that it cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty that Putin will decide to go to Lithuania, Latvia or Poland. Then it will not be possible to talk about a reset, but about a NATO-Russia war.
&gt; 
&gt; However, assuming that Ukraine - in a heroic battle and thanks to the support of the world - will force the Russians to withdraw, the world will certainly not be the same anymore. I cannot imagine that it would be possible to return to a similar policy with Russia, and especially with Putin's Russia. It will be necessary to maintain sanctions for years and absolute distrust of the Kremlin.
&gt; 
&gt; The PiS government's policy towards the EU will not be as before?
&gt;
&gt; Understanding the need for cooperation in the EU will mitigate politicians such as PiS leaders. In view of the threat from Russia, it is necessary to move from the sidelines towards the EU's decision-making currents.
&gt; 
&gt; Tensions are to be expected in Poland. Long-term government policy must replace the reflexes of the heart. Over time, fatigue and - what is inevitable - will surely emerge - tensions that can be exploited by cynical politicians. It is at such moments of rehearsal that the characters come true. Some politicians will turn out to be cowards and selfish, others are dedicated and brave, even if we did not suspect them of it before.",444a65d2a4408299bdfd436d2f33fd0ce097f808,True,False,,,,,0,1647787851,,0,{},i1eq95s,True,t3_tim3sd,False,True,t3_tim3sd,/r/geopolitics/comments/tim3sd/kwaśniewski_20_years_ago_i_had_a_facetoface/i1eq95s/,1647787866,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647759051.0,[],text,t2_oop22,False,True

# CHINA

&gt; Which side is China on?
&gt;
&gt; They stand astride. On the one hand, they say that they are against war, but on the other hand, they are satisfied with the Russian argument that Ukraine is historically part of great Russia and should be with the motherland. And they say this because they took the same attitude towards Hong Kong and today towards Taiwan, where a great armed conflict is also threatened.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the years, China has maintained close political and economic contacts with Ukraine. They cannot completely turn away from Kiev, so they cannot. The Chinese ambassador to Kiev stated that China supports Ukraine and will not participate in any attack by it, but this is only said by the ambassador, not the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the president. China is watching the war and declares itself ready to play a role in finding a peaceful solution. However, we have not heard anything about Beijing's specific actions in this direction, so they either do it in Chinese, that is, discreetly, or they do nothing.
&gt;
&gt; And China, being a power, has the key to force an end to the war?
No, but China's attitude is a very important factor that may make the situation of Ukraine very difficult or help it.
&gt; 
&gt; For China, any dispute between the US and, for example, Russia is beneficial because it involves America, which reduces the US involvement in the Pacific. The coming days will show where China will go and whether it wants to play an active role.
&gt; 
&gt; So far, Chinese President Xi Jinping has talked about ""strategic partnership"" with Russia and ""friendship without borders"". Do you still see a chance for China to be dragged over to the West?
It is not feasible. China will not join the West, but it can say: you wanted to wage trade wars with us, but it is not profitable for you, let's cooperate pragmatically.
&gt; 
&gt; All the words Xi Jinping says about friendship with Russia are declarations - neighborly and marked by memories. China wants to make Russia vassal in the long run. After all, if we compare China's economic, demographic and military power with Russia, Moscow has nothing to fear. Russia is experiencing a demographic catastrophe, it is depopulating, and Siberia is uninhabited, while there are several hundred million Chinese living across the river who would like to settle there.
&gt; 
&gt; Russians, weakened by the war with Ukraine, doomed to play the role of China's vassal?
The Russians stand no chance of a collision with China. Economically, Beijing is a growing power. Russia only has an advantage when it comes to nuclear weapons, but in 10-20 years and the latter advantage will disappear, because China is spending colossal money on arming.
&gt; 
&gt; What does Russia have? An army whose myth has just crumbled. It also has gas and oil, which, however, are increasingly being replaced by renewable energy sources. The Chinese will patiently but firmly exploit the weakness of Russia, which in the long term will suffer more and more losses in connection with the war with Ukraine and the sanctions of the West.
&gt; 
&gt; Can the US force China not to support Russia at least?
&gt; 
&gt; China is a power that must be handled like an egg. After all, if the Chinese do not produce something, then entire production lines in the USA and Europe will stop. We saw it in the Covid-19 pandemic. China is economically keeping the whole world in check.

GERMANY

&gt; Will the anti-Russian shift in Germany continue and end in a move away from Russian gas and oil?
It is difficult to predict today, but this turn must be taken seriously - it will have colossal consequences in German politics. In Germany - in politics and business - the Russlandversteher group has always been strong, people who ""understand Russia.""
&gt;
&gt; .. especially in the SPD, which is in power today and has a chancellor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the Russian aggression, the Germans who ""understand Russia"" are shattered - they are in a state of mental collapse because they absolutely did not expect a war. They expected Putin to press, demand and look for taunts, but he would behave rationally. Putin has become irrational, however, and for many pro-Russian politicians in Germany it is a shock. Prof. Klaus Bachmann points out that some of them are already moving to extremely anti-Russian positions, which is typical of neophytes.

The turnaround in Germany is happening and I am sure it will be permanent. But not instantaneous. When it comes to Russian gas and oil, not only Germany, but also other European countries - such as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria - depend on their supplies. Germany cannot give up Russian raw materials overnight, but the first decisions of Olaf Scholz's government are to postpone the closure of nuclear power plants and thus reduce dependence on Russia.

Germany just needs energy from somewhere. After all, we are talking about the largest industrial economy in Europe. The British live off the capital market, others have income from tourism, and the Germans have to make cars or else they will slide into crisis.
&gt;
&gt; Do you know the current [chancellor] Olaf Scholz?
&gt; 
&gt; I know him and trust him. I know he is a very competent and reliable politician. If he promises something, then he does it. He will look for solutions, but giving up Russian oil and gas is not a monthly project.

# TURKEY

&gt; Turkey has a significant role in forcing an end to the war?
&gt;
&gt; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is playing his game. It must be said that - disagreeing with his internal politics and attitude towards the EU - he plays it efficiently. Last year, with the support of Turkey, Azerbaijan successfully started recapture Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia's troops were defeated, and Azerbaijan took whatever he wanted, at the same time inviting the Russians to act as mirotors - peacekeepers that would separate the parties.
&gt; 
&gt; Erdogan has a plan to support those countries that belong to the broadly understood Turkish language and sphere of influence, while not openly conflicting with Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; Now Turkey is supplying weapons, including combat drones, to Ukraine. Erdogan also offers Turkey as a place for peace talks.
&gt;
&gt; Erdogan's attitude towards the war in Ukraine is as follows: we do not agree with this war and we give room for peace talks. But since this is not our war, let no one complain that we are selling - this is important: we are selling - our military equipment to Ukraine. Erdogan likes Russia's long-term weakening. I think that regionally Erdogan will soon want to use it in Central Asia and the Caucasus.",a9317749d186e929c91b226430c4e7cea7179e97,True,False,,,,,0,1647787835,,0,{},i1eq7ug,True,t3_tim3sd,False,True,t3_tim3sd,/r/geopolitics/comments/tim3sd/kwaśniewski_20_years_ago_i_had_a_facetoface/i1eq7ug/,1647787854,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647759035.0,[],text,t2_oop22,False,True

They have the opposite effect in regards to government support. When people are attacked, they tend to rally around the leader. Of course, people claim it's not to overthrow the government. I'd say it's a lot of hemming and hawing to wiggle out of the truth: sanctions rarely if ever achieve their objective. There are volumes of literature on this, most of them rather pessimistic about sanctions. Think about it in American terms. What do you think would happen if China sanctioned us? Inflation would get really bad, but people wouldn't overthrow their government. They'd get angry and unite against China. That's how it usually goes. People don't usually stop to think about the wider context of any conflict. it gets reduced to good versus evil and any nuance or self-reflection is lost. 

The problem here is that sanctions have been so overused as to be meaningless. There are entire sectors of the banking, legal services, and accounting services devoted to getting around sanctions. North Korea is the master of getting around sanctions. They've successfully done it for decades. North korea shoots off missiles like there's a firesale on ICBMs.   


As for Russia, the global south has not sanctioned Russia and is not going to stop trading with them. The bulk of the world's population resides outside the US, EU, and their Asian allied states. That is where the high-growth markets are at this point. Russia is doubling down on Asia. In this case, the US has likely undermined its currency permanently as the largest economies of the global south are making deals to trade in Russian or Chinese currency to get around US sanctions. Therefore, it is unlikely sanctioning Russia will work as intended.",4947205d1065b8417d00856a4dce71f5680b0ec5,True,False,,,,,0,1647787694,,0,{},i1epwkd,False,t3_ti97yf,False,True,t3_ti97yf,/r/geopolitics/comments/ti97yf/have_american_sanctions_ever_actually_gotten_a/i1epwkd/,1647787710,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647758894.0,[],text,t2_e1n5d788,False,False

# UNITED STATES

&gt; The USA and President Joe Biden Are Authentic Leaders of the Free World?
&gt;
&gt; Let's close our eyes and imagine that today the US President is Donald Trump. The man who undermined the rationality of NATO, insulted European allies, was fascinated by Putin and pursued a narcissistic, selfish policy. The very fact that Biden is the president is worth appreciating.
&gt; 
&gt; Biden is a man of principles and he tries to live by them. I read the book by Hunter Biden - Joe Biden's very difficult son - ""All Beautiful Things"". She is convinced that thanks to Joe Biden's love and closeness to his son, it was possible to help a lost man. Biden never pushed his son away, though it might have been convenient for him.
&gt; 
&gt; He is a man of persistent persuasion - he reaches out to people, he explains. He does not impose his opinion, but it is thanks to him that the West speaks with one voice and NATO has become stronger. Biden fulfills his role beyond expectations. May he have enough health and energy, which is not easy at his age. We are really lucky to have Biden. If it weren't for him, we'd be in a black hole.
&gt; 
&gt; Initially, however, Biden shifted responsibility for Europe to the shoulders of Europe itself, to focus on rivalry with China?
&gt; 
&gt; Today I do not see such a temptation anymore. Putin, by starting a war in Ukraine, helped reverse the tendency to shift the main US interest from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which had already begun in US policy during the presidency of Barack Obama. For years, America has focused more and more on rivalry with China rather than on its presence in Europe. Therefore, at the NATO summit in Newport in 2014 - during the Obama presidency - a decision was made to increase state spending on the army to 2 percent. GDP. Trump then bluntly demanded that Europe increase its spending to focus on its own rivalry with China. Biden was also close to the idea until Putin started the war in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; The prospect of a NATO-Russia conflict is not excluded?
&gt;
&gt; Putin directly says that the main threat to Russia comes from NATO, because the Pact - as Putin lies - wants to destroy Russia and its great values. NATO must therefore be prepared for a scenario in which Russia attacks Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia or Poland. In the various scenarios that need to be considered, a NATO war against Russia is not out of the question. In fact, it has not been so close to this confrontation for a long time as it is today.

# UKRAINE

&gt; For now, Putin is leveling Ukraine with the ground and killing civilians. Ukraine will have the potential to recover from this rubble?
&gt;
&gt; There are examples of countries - like Poland - that were rising from the ruins. After the Second World War, despite the resignation from the Marshall Plan, Poland managed to rebuild it with great social effort. Under conditions of limited sovereignty, but without the threat of physical extermination, it was possible to rebuild Warsaw, create the foundations of industry and a lot of other great things. Ukraine's potential is not less than ours.
&gt; 
&gt; If the war does not end with occupation, and the Ukrainians are able to live in their country, even at the cost of giving up NATO, but with a presence in the European Union, they will be able to rebuild the country. Especially with the help of the EU and encouraging Ukrainians to return to their homeland. Ukrainians are well educated, non-demoralized and do not suffer from laziness due to satiety.
&gt;
&gt;But when? This is a distant vision as the bombs keep falling.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe in a few years. Ukraine may emerge from the ruins more modern, identical, conscious and hungry for development.
&gt; 
&gt; What are the minimum conditions for Ukraine's victory?
&gt; 
&gt; Today, resistance every day is a victory. The persistence of Kiev is a victory. The presence of President Volodymyr Zelensky in the capital and the actions of the state are everyday victories. Cease fire, although I do not believe it, would be a success. Limiting the number of victims - too. But Zelenskiy's biggest problem will be if he can return to the pre-invasion state by February 24th on the negotiating table. This would mean accepting Ukraine's lack of power over Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. Would that be accepted by the Ukrainians as a wise compromise or a betrayal? I cannot answer myself, but I know it would be a very risky moment for Zelensky.
&gt;
&gt; So far, there are no such negotiations. Putin will fight in the belief that he will defeat Ukraine.
&gt;
&gt; Zelenskiy could do something more than before?
He is an excellent war-time leader and so keeps in touch with the nation. In terms of communication, it is phenomenal. He stays in Kiev, mobilizes and gives faith, builds morale - at the present stage, he can do nothing better.
&gt; 
&gt; His emphasis on the West is always on point. Generally, he always says the same thing, but uses different, very pertinent arguments. When he speaks in the US Congress, he admonishes the Americans: you are not helping to defend the skies over Ukraine, and yet your greatest misfortunes came from heaven - at Pearl Harbor as a result of the Japanese air raid and on September 11, when terrorists attacked the US. These are arguments that even a poorly educated American can understand.
&gt;
&gt; In turn, speaking to the Germans, he emphasizes the expectations of the German leadership. He wisely builds arguments towards various partners, weaving symbolic and emotional elements. This is paying off, since the West - and mainly the US - are handing over more weapons.",4566a120097c17023bb1b48972538af5ecd88d16,True,False,,,,,0,1647787253,,0,{},i1eoxga,True,t3_tim3sd,False,True,t3_tim3sd,/r/geopolitics/comments/tim3sd/kwaśniewski_20_years_ago_i_had_a_facetoface/i1eoxga/,1647787271,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647758453.0,[],text,t2_oop22,False,True

## RUSSIA

&gt; Jacek Gądek: - Putin has been in power for 22 years. Do you think that you planned a war with Ukraine from the beginning?
&gt; 
&gt; Aleksander Kwaśniewski: - Did he plan this war at the beginning of his presidency? I doubt it. But he certainly dreamed of conquering Ukraine by then. Anyway, I have proof of that.
&gt; 
&gt; What?
&gt; 
&gt; In 2002, I had a long private, private conversation with Putin. He told me outright that for him one of the most important tasks was to rebuild a great Russia. Just as he believed that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century, he also believed that great Russia should rebuild itself. He was a young president then, only in office for two years and had no instruments to take over Ukraine, but he has already talked about it. Both in conversation with me and then in public. Putin never really recognized Ukraine as a state and Ukrainians as a nation.
&gt;
&gt; I think that in Putin the obsession with a great Russia, and therefore with the conquest of Ukraine, was growing. Over the years, he took advantage of successive opportunities, on the one hand, to rebuild the empire, and on the other, to test the West's reaction. After the war with Georgia in 2008, this reaction was too weak, as in 2014 after the annexation of Crimea and the detachment of the Donbas. This only encouraged Putin to prepare a full-scale war with Ukraine. Putin's initial dream became more and more a plan.
&gt; 
&gt; Why now?
&gt;
&gt; I can see a couple of explanations. First: Putin is getting older and the younger one will not. Second: 22 years of monopoly means detachment from reality. Third: Putin looked at the world and found the time to be favorable.
&gt;
&gt; According to Putin, the US is in a crisis because Joe Biden, as an elderly man, will not take harsh action. Because - according to Putin - in Europe after Angela Merkel's era everything is weak and it will only be built anew. He decided that China would not stop him, because they themselves had similar plans for Taiwan. He also thought he had the money to finance the war, because Russia had accumulated huge surpluses by trading in oil and gas. Finally, he considered the election of an inexperienced actor to the presidency of Ukraine to make the war easier. Putin expected a blitzkrieg and started a war.
&gt;
&gt; After almost a month, there are many comments that Putin has already lost this war. But isn't that wishful thinking?
&gt; 
&gt; Putin will actually lose in the long run. Because - first of all - Ukraine is being born before our eyes, even if it is physically destroyed. It is no longer possible for Ukraine to be part of Russia except under occupation and terror, and Russia does not have the strength to occupy it as a whole. After 30 years of Ukraine's independence, Putin finally helped her believe in her own identity, strength and pride. Ukrainians will be Russia's enemies for many centuries.
&gt; 
&gt; Putin has already lost also because the world has noticed his true face. I cannot imagine that - even after the conclusion of a truce or peace - Putin would be able to return to the salons. He will always be considered a war criminal. But is it necessary to talk to Putin as the president of Russia? Yes you should. But you absolutely cannot believe him.
&gt; 
&gt; Putin also did not win in the short-term plan, because he was buried in a war - it could last for months. In the medium term, in turn, if Putin managed to take control of Kyiv and install obedient power there, he could strengthen his position in Russia with deceptive propaganda. But that would be a Pyrrhic success.

Some things I'd say, even though I'm no expert are,

1) UCAVs are still relatively large, and supposing the enemy had strong air options, would be destroyed before getting close. They are also specialised, so ones that are good at destroying tanks are sitting ducks for options specialized for air-battle. This field will probably shift a lot as the years go by.

2) A lot of the more guerrila-esque targeted anti-tank/anti-plane weapons usually need people to carry them. Given cheaper smaller aerial drones that can scout, and a more brutal initial air coverage -&gt; long range bombardment to destroy key resource targets and warehouses while also scaring away the population, it'd be a lot harder to get close or at least cause the risk levels to increase drastically, which matters because it hits morale and willingness to attempt these missions.

3) Apparently the Russians have a lot of tank stock and are fine with losses to an extent, especially as many of them would require eventual replacement relatively soon. Hence, seeing them being so 'wasteful' with tanks, could possibly be making it look like Ukraine is doing a lot more than they actually are.

4) Ukraine on it's own would have no chance vs Russia. The US has been training Ukraine on the down low, and giving them resources ever since Crimea. Ukraine has also been sent a lot of help from the other european nations. So seeing Ukraine 'out perform' is not surprising, especially given the gross miscalculations that Russia appeared to have made during the initial stages.

5) Effectiveness of X or Y, depends on who or what you're enemy is, the terrain, the scale, morale etc etc. Ukraine is the second largest country by land-mass in europe. Crimea was small, hence it was x100 easier, than trying to take the entirety of Ukraine. Russia took it's initial targets relatively easily and quickly, and the Ukrainian ground forces were probably overwhelmed here, and hence the tanks/planes arguably did their job. It was after they started to spread out, that they started to struggle, as naturally big heavy things need a lot of coverage/supplies, and the more you spread, the more difficult it is to provide effective coverage. Point is, imagine if Russia focused on just taking the southern part of Ukraine first, consolidated it, since to me coastal Ukraine is much more valuable personally, and then gone north towards Kiev - we probably wouldn't be seeing a lot of the chaos occurring right now.

I still agree though that the technological shift has influenced this war a lot, and that things will change fast in the future. Like, the strongest military in the future will likely be one with the best adaptive fleet of specialized UCAVs that can effectively kamikaze the enemy into submission. Why I think wars are becoming increasingly pointless.

[],False,,Mental-Egg-8355,,,,,,"First of all to the power plants belongs a grid and consumers. Keep that in mind.

Second thing we need to clear up baseload. It's the lowest amount of demand. That on average around 35 GW in Germany. Peak is around 70 GW.
Gas has a capacity of 30 GW currently.

Also other sources, like coal are also in the picture.

Germany massively lacks the grid infrastructure to send nuclear power anywhere. The high capacity lines are delayed and around 120 000km of powerlines are needed to built.

Due being cheap and plentiful, lignite dominates central Germany, which has no nuclear therefore.

We have/had nuclear in the Northwest. That is the renewable hub, especially wind. Any source outside renewables are marginal. Nuclear reopening or keeping longer would have near zero impact on gas. It would be mostly wind and nuclear eating each others profits and plenty of curtailed electricity.

The South had also nuclear. Here especially in Bavaria gas also plays a role. Those states are even importer.
Keeping nuclear could be an option theoretically.

Now we get to the praxis and why it's not done.
The plants will shut down the end of the year.
The owner of the plants planned operation with that in mind. Running longer would possibly required a small overhaul, but sure will cost a lot. They would need to run atleast 5 years to recoup the cost.
Also old nuclear plants have reliability issues. It would be nothing new, if a plant would go offline for several months. Also the plant owners also stated they don't want to.

So the decisions was made to not look into that and just accelerate what was planned anyway. Fast track grid infrastructure, renewable built up especially in the South.

The would likely be more cost effective and depending how successful the easter legislative package, could even  be short term as effective. (A second one is planned for summer)

The far bigger short term factor is hardcoal. It is often fulfilling the same function as gas. The phase out was halted. The last years we saw more hardcoal go than nuclear. 


Also a nice fun fact, in absolute numbers the years before nuclear exit 201,  electricity generation by gas was highest. Gas rapidly declined after the nuclear phase-out due high prices for years.",35f68c97f0ed0cb192c34e0b55e87a69f2356c95,True,False,,,,,0,1647738801,,0,{},i1cnckx,False,t3_th0p2b,False,False,t1_i1aqcfy,/r/geopolitics/comments/th0p2b/understanding_germanys_foreign_policy/i1cnckx/,1647738816,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647710001.0,[],text,t2_dpgfqg0e,False,False

&gt;This is the first war we are seeing advanced anti tank weapons used and when a soldier carrying a 20k piece of equipment can destroy a half a million dollar tank you have to ask yourself what is the point of them?

It isn't, the Iran-Iraq war saw significant use of ATGM's (and I'm sure others may know of earlier large scale deployments against armor). Yes, javelins are a dramatic upgrade in that they're useable by single operators, and they're more portable than a Kornet or TOW, but is it really that dramatic as far as the burning tank is concerned? They've always been ambushable by infantry, all the way back to the Pak-40, or a 70 reichsmark Panszerschreck (compared to 100k RM Panther).
