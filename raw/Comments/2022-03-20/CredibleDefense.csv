&gt; LINDSEY O'ROURKE is an Associate Professor of Political Science at Boston College and a Non-Resident Fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. She is also the author of Covert Regime Change: America’s Secret Cold War.

Quote from the article:

&gt; The United States’ record for covertly arming foreign dissidents is remarkably poor. When members of President Barack Obama’s administration debated covertly arming Syrian opposition forces in 2012 and 2013, for instance, they asked the CIA to conduct an internal assessment of the agency’s record for such operations. The results, in the words of one former senior administration official, were “pretty dour.” As Obama later put it in an interview with The New Yorker, “I actually asked the CIA to analyze examples of America financing and supplying arms to an insurgency in a country that actually worked out well. And they couldn’t come up with much.”

&gt; That should have come as no surprise: out of 35 U.S. attempts to covertly arm foreign dissidents during the Cold War, only four succeeded in bringing U.S. allies to power. Notably, an early U.S. operation to support Ukrainian nationalists in their bid to secede from the Soviet Union during the early Cold War was a failure. The U.S.-backed Ukrainian partisans were simply no match for Soviet intelligence, which easily infiltrated and then brutally suppressed the movement. Indeed, the operation ended so disastrously for the U.S.-backed partisans that a declassified CIA history later concluded, “In the long run, the Agency’s effort to penetrate the Iron Curtain using Ukrainian agents was ill-fated and tragic.”

I found the idea of quantifying the success of previous attempts at assisting insurgencies to be fascinating. The situation in Ukraine has not devolved into a situation were the nation is conquered with a resistance, but there are areas that have fallen to Russian forces. 

The news out of Mariupol that I have read is that the civilians who do surrender to the Russians are heavily screened, and deported out of the area. It seems that Russia is taking the chances of an insurgency very seriously and taking extreme efforts to minimize it.",dbf7695c1661df4e8652a791c0f513330bb01f79,True,False,,,,,0,1647820017,,0,{},i1guetb,True,t3_tiy2id,False,True,t3_tiy2id,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tiy2id/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i1guetb/,1647820029,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647791217.0,
[],False,,June1994,,,[],,,,text,t2_fgez9,False,True,"&gt;Faced with that prospect, U.S. and allied policymakers have no doubt begun to consider what measures can be taken should that come to pass, especially given the likelihood that a determined Ukrainian insurgency will continue to resist Russian occupation. As they study whether and how to support this resistance, including with a steady flow of arms, it is worth remembering that this is not the first time the United States has faced this question: during the Cold War, Washington backed more than more than two dozen insurgencies fighting Soviet-backed governments or Soviet occupation, from Albania in the 1940s to Afghanistan in the 1980s.

It's important to understand, and this war taught me that, that political decision-makers are driven by emotion as much as the cold-calculus of war (which can often times be wrong anyway). We may try to help Ukraine out of a misguided sympathy and good intentions, regardless of what consequences come of it.

Of course, the cynical part of me sees our interests in turning Ukraine into Syria.

Explain ""cope"". Realist perspective on Great Power politics is that you sometimes have to sacrifice smaller states' rights in order to prevent larger all continental or wars among Great Powers. Sometimes, lesser people's lives need to be sacrificed,like proxy wars,  to serve as an outlet of conflicts to prevent Great Powers from actually clashing. The reasoning is ""fewer deaths"" in total.

Ukraine is perhaps the strongest ex-soviet republic besides Russia, and Putin's military command was revealed to be inefficient in gear, lives, and cost as far back as Grozny for anyone who is watching. The problem is that Putin almost certainly knows, and doesn't care - his military leadership's apparent doctrine is to overwhelm with numbers. 

As a founding republic of the USSR, that enormous bank of anti air systems and fortifications was built by and retained by the Ukranian people when they choose to leave the USSR. The smaller Warsaw pact countries absolutely do not have similar amounts of firepower, troops, and 8 years of active war footing since Donbas necessary to repel an invasion of the size Putin has fielded. e.g, [Ukraine reports 245,000 active personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine); Russia can clearly deploy 200,000 soldiers; [Moldova has less than 5000 total active soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Republic_of_Moldova).

The French government that shot and bayoneted the Parisian rebels are long gone but if only it's because it was overthrown. Its contemporaries, the British and Canadian ones are still around.

What you ""want"" doesn't matter, because you don't get a choice. The ""better"" government you have now is an accident of your birth. 150 years from now, perhaps the future people will take a piss at how tyrannical our current governments were, because they had to beat people with batons and tear gas them; may be at that time, they will be able to just snap a finger and reprogram the rebels' brains and resolve the difference that way. They will have the means, in the same way that the current police have all of these supposedly ""less than lethal"" weapons whereas 19th century French army only had muskets abd bayonets.


&gt;so?

It's a lesson on how much you can achieve with protests and attempted revolts. Those things are mostly threats and intimidations. For every successful French revolution, there was half to a dozen failed attempts. So once the state decides that ""enough is enough"" and send in the violence to brute force their way out of the crisis, fun's over. Historical evidence shows that they are likely to prevail, but we just kinda forget all the times the rebels lost. Don't stand and attempt to duke it out on the street. There is a low probability that it will succeed, one in five or ten, but most of the time, it will just be pointless violence that will be forgotten.",0a8b1683e638b08a26e8d0b683e444e65cc993a6,True,False,,,,,0,1647817536,,0,{},i1goxpe,False,t3_ti8ik4,False,True,t1_i1gm5dx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti8ik4/nato_and_the_road_not_taken_condemning_putins_war/i1goxpe/,1647817549,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647788736.0,

The author is Indian and India has been dealing with border incursions with China for decades. Where were the indignation from Western states and sanctions on China? Oh perhaps you want to argue that it's just people fighting with baseball bats and fists but note that the medieval fighting was because central leadership was so afraid of real hot wars that they agreed that troops on contact line should not use rifles. In other words, if this were 1941, it would have progressed to full-on shooting. The difference was in degrees, not nature; but where were the absolutists asking for absolute ""rights""? Of course India now regards the war in Ukraine as ""Europe's problem"" and they cash in on Russian cheap oil. European ambassadors and officials angrily chastised India with which Indians responded ""what are we, your slaves?""

Where is this Lincolnite moralism when you need it today? Or is it more reasonable that while personally, Lincoln may have had conviction towards abolition of slavery, but never had the political capital to enact it. The ACW had to be sold as anti-secessionist first and only a few years into it, abolitionist. The initial justification had to be realist and political, but Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman were effective abolitionist, as imperfect as they may have been.

The ACW also showed what really lays at the foundation of political power: violence. Grant had to kill his ways through Confederate soldiers' lives and Sherman had to burn his way through Georgia. Note the implication of Sherman's campaign of destruction. If you rob the food and supplies from the population and winter was coming, well, his soldiers may not have directly killed those Georgians, but those actions would have been war crimes today",16a3f2c8ba3c388b51655c508f182857f3f4311a,True,False,,,,,0,1647816526,,0,{},i1gmnjk,False,t3_ti8ik4,False,True,t1_i1ezh8s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti8ik4/nato_and_the_road_not_taken_condemning_putins_war/i1gmnjk/,1647816545,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647787726.0,

2. The UK and the USSR were literally fighting existential conflicts, troop morale was at an all time high. German soldiers were entirely behind the war too, although for very different reasons. 

3. WW2 was technologically far far less advanced than today. Even the tanks and planes both sides used were simple to operate compared to todays vehicles. Sophisticated combined arms operations weren't commonplace due to comparative difficulty in acquiring real time intelligence and facilitating communication between units. This meant that the difference between fielding barely trained conscripts and highly skilled professional soldiers was far less significant. 

4. All major combatants in WW2 were running war-economies, which meant that all non-essential resources and manufacturing was being funneled into fueling the war machine. This was only feasible due to the low (relatively) quality of goods and services people were used to, along with the simplicity of the supply chains needed to deliver them, meaning that you could shut down half your businesses without the whole house of cards collapsing. Modern nations struggle to do this (unless faced with an existential threat) because educated citizens of prosperous nations do not want to sacrifice every aspect of their quality of life for abstract geopolitical goals.

Ukraine is operating exactly like the allies in WW2, they are taking extraordinary measures and huge sacrifices. If they sustain the loss of 100,000 soldiers in combat, they will likely keep fighting since the alternative is annihilation. Volunteers and conscripts will fill the void, and even if they are poor substitutes for the current army they will keep the fighting going. If the Russians loses 500,000 soldiers they have to begin mass conscription of Russian civilians with no combat exposure, who will not be keen on fighting and will be incapable of executing the complex combined arms operations needed to effectively fight in urban combat. 

If you want to understand what this ""collapse"" might look like, read up about the Vietnam wars effects domestically in the USA. It wasn't that the country descended into anarchy simply by losing the war, its that their ability to fight effectively fell off a cliff in a short period of time and it became politically impossible to continue.",6765bae6b3fb2feff75a35fcac78cb26c37ee5b0,True,False,,,,,0,1647815533,,0,{},i1gke2t,False,t3_timlu1,False,True,t1_i1fmnjk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/timlu1/ukraine_megathread_march_20/i1gke2t/,1647815544,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647786733.0,

IMO, the collectivization of various ISA/MSA units under USOCOM means that once service-unique specialties are either being merged or 'pre-packaged' to go with specific Team deployment requirements.

  
A road watch party could include COMINT people to listen to radio comms in a given column.  Building EOB.

  
While a MAV provider could help provide standoff alert to or propaganda support of ambush teams moving up to engage said column.

  
All of which could then be considered 'SR' based on the teams being employed to provide secure satcomms targeting for the native CCWS/SLM ambush party.

  
Of course, depending on which side of the bush you were standing on, it works both ways.

  
If you have access to Spetz, they can be dropped 10km out, off a helicopter and walk it in, to a crossroad.  They know how to do this, just as well as we do and the standoff+night insert protects their ride.

  
So when the 'bad guys' with their Javelins and PF3s arrive, they bushwhack the ambushers.

  
In some place like Syria, they would use a drone or preplaced camera to look through a window to make sure the POI was actually with his girlfriend that night before the snatch/kill team or Kh-101 entered the neighborhood.

  
I think that Spetz, at least initially, led with this because a lot of their cyber came out of Cold War era radio electronic combat formations which were hot-keyed to artillery.  An effort further improved with the 2014 campaigns.  And thus, it just made sense that they would first target then deny/disrupt.

  
The Russians have always been more intuitively effects driven that way, whereas our sneaky bastards have been more 'observe but do not interact' driven.

  
Even so, it makes very little sense that Putin would send his troops south, on a restricted road net, with forests on either side and insufficient logistics as IRCM to cover the transverse roads from approaching anti-armor teams using conventional (second) division Acav/CCA flank security.

  
Without some form of friendly SR level unit, preplaced enroute and watching the Ukrainians drive up, your own guys have no way to know what they're headed into and so your CS/CSS in particular are going to bang-ow-bang-bang, all the way down the stair case.

  
That this is -not- routinely happening likely means that, despite the propaganda being shown, what is occurring is not an amateur hour event of 1-2 NLAWs then run awaaaaay-

  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfRcmJTAouM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfRcmJTAouM)

  
But rather signals something far worse: promil USOF teams which strike from within the forests themselves.  As long as cover is uniform (as it is for long stretches of M01/M02, again, with forests on both sides), there is no predicting such a team location and particularly if they are using X-600 Switch Blades with limited launch signature, they can see to target from 6-10km out without breaking LOS boundaries.

  
As they would have to do, with 4km Javelin.

  
Media are then notified, via their New York home office, to: 'Go to XX/YY, you might find something interesting' and when they get there (across miles of Route 66 level, two lane blacktop, lousy roads, populated with Russian combat formations no less...), lo and behold!  There are the Keystone Cops, I mean Ukrainian Army, capering about, kicking open crates full of various munitions, food and water in a column of not 1 or 2 but 10-12 burned up vehicles.

As if they just discovered it.  Because they just did.

  
That is the real deal difference.

  
CAG/CAD have likely put us into a 'single degree of separation', unacknowledged SOF, hotwar with the Russians.

  
And we don't even know it.

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"Pretty far. In physics theres Wave Mechanics, which you can learn somewhat independent of the mediums the waves are traveling in.

But even beyond that, fields are a foundational concept in modern physics, or even physics post Newton really. A field is just a mathematical formalism that assigns some number to every point of space within a volume. A textbook example would be thinking about the air temperature in a room. You can imagine putting a thermometer at any particular point in the room and getting a specific temperature. That's an example of a field, specifically a scalar field since the value we associate to each point in space is a simple single integer magnitude.

With waves in water or air, we can imagine instead of temperature, a pressure at every point. Then if we iterate forward some increment in time, those individual pressures combine and propagate locally to neighboring points in space. The velocity of any particle in the air/water is the gradient of the pressure field through that point. So now we have a scalar field, pressure, that also has a dual associated with it, namely velocity, which is a vector (ie has not just a magnitude, but a direction).

EM fields are similar, but with some additional quirks. They're transverse waves, not scalar waves. This means the waves are like children playing with a piece of rope, moving one end up and down perpendicular to the direction of the rope until a wave pattern emerges along it. EM waves are produced in a very similar way: wiggle electrons, and they emit waves. But, there's additional complexities to EM fields. There's both a magnetic and electric component, and the direction of ""jiggle"" in these components are constrained to be at a 90 degree angle to each other, and perpendicular to direction the wave is propagating. Our primate brains ain't great at visualizing this. Physicists just develop an intuition based on the underlying math.

So anyhow, that's a bit of a ramble, but to tie a bow back on it: waves in fields are a very foundational concept in modern physics, and you'll start building up an intuition for them even just reading analogies like the water one. But these analogies are not the same thing as the math, and will always be a pretty imperfect and distorted way of understanding things.

Here's a great video that just goes into this analogy and the intuitions based on it in an open ended way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB83DpBJQsE",bf0be14e7cdf9f7109ac0d6739f414b1d3b357b0,True,False,,,,,0,1647802788,,0,{},i1fqkrf,False,t3_tfnt4a,False,True,t1_i12qgl6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfnt4a/how_do_you_intercept_lpi_radar_and_radio/i1fqkrf/,1647802800,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647773988.0,

You say they are a mighty force that is right now ""preserving"" cities. That to me indicates you believe they have this hinge amount of guns and rocket tubes they can focus on a city and just level it. First of all, why do you believe this? Do you know for sure how many viable tubes they have? Do you follow Wikipedia numbers? 

In any case, I think that's another gross misunderstanding of how military might works and that you don't understand the scale of this conflict . Russia managed to do this ""utter destruction"" nonsense before. In Grozny. They needed 4 months, that was one city, they still took huge losses. Grozny was a 300.000 people city. That's a tenth of the size of Kyiv. Ukraine has 20 cities larger than Grozny. 

Russia has large numbers in paper but the numbers are pointless if we don't know they ability to supply these 10.000 tubes of artillery they have on paper. The nominal size of the army is pointless as long as you can only keep one tenth of it supplied in the field. And we don't have numbers on their supply capacity. We just have the evidence of what they are doing right now. And right now they have 5 axes if advance that they can't keep in supply. We have evidence of sporadic but very localised artillery use.

They are not preserving Kharkiv, or Mariopol or Kyiv. They are striking civilian targets but not in focused fires. It's just that if they push large artillery formations close to the cities they are exposed to counter battery fires and raids. This happened and they took losses. 

In the last two weeks we've seen individual MLRS vehicles get close, fire a full load then move back. There is no military logic to doing thst. Those are dumb, innacurate projectiles and they're using them just like Hamas is doing it in Palestine. It's terror bombing, not an artillery barrage or a surgical strike. This seems to be the limit of what they can do. Sporadic and scattered fires, sporadic attempts to advance, timid probing around cities and not securing any city beyond the easy pickings just next to the border they achieved with surprise in the first two days. 

I don't see this ""occupation"" you talk of. Does the footage of daily protests and Ukrainean flags waving in Kherson seem like a sustainable occupation to you? Besides that they have villages and road junctions. And I'm bit saying this disparagingly, it's just the facts that we can see even when taking into account Russian statements on their progress. More than 3 weeks in and even indefensible Mariopol that's right next to the Donbas contact line has not been reduced. They just lost another general there yesterday, which tells about how badly the advance is going that a general had to be anywhere close to the front lines to manage it. I'm not talking about the Ukrainean propaganda or the thousand tanks they supposedly lost already, just the (lack of significant) territorial gains, the addmited casualties and the overall supply situation that is a hard proxy for their capability.",4234993e4a4e26bfb57654394bbe1c370eb5032e,True,False,,,,,0,1647798172,,0,{},i1ffg4k,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i1f93zn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i1ffg4k/,1647798184,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647769372.0,

When talking in terms of western military technology, hypersonic weapons specifically refer to Hyperonic Glide Vehicles or Hypersonic Cruise missiles, both of which are distinct from ballistic missiles which can also achieve hypersonic speeds. What makes HGVs and HCMs different from ballistic weapons is their flight profile. Put in oversimplified terms, ballistic weapons launch upward and then dive sharply down to achieve their hypersonic speed. HGVs an HCMs instead fly like an airplane at hypersonic speeds to their target, Glide Vehicles do this unpowered and Cruise Missiles fly with power. The advantage new hypersonic weapons offer is because of their shallower flight path, they can avoid being detected by radar for a longer period of time, and the weapons can maneuver better as well to avoid defenses. The constraining factor right now for hypersonic weapons is accuracy, with acceptable PKs only achievable with nuclear warheads, and the US likely intends to use their hypersonic weapons with conventional warheads so it can employ them more broadly. Finally of note, Russia claims its Kinzhal missile is a hypersonic weapon, but is in reality a ballistic missile, and does not have the flight profile of advanced hypersonic weapons. Instead Russia is deliberately mixing definitions to make it seem more formidable than it is.

Yes I read it. My reading comprehension is likely far superior to yours. I'll explain the contention here though as you clearly can't follow the comment chain.

NATO bears no responsibility for Russia's actions, and in fact should have gone much further in order to deter Russian imperialism.

&gt; Oh boy, where to begin? The fact that you think this is some ""own"" is a huge red flag to me that you're a Debate Bro, but whatever, I'll explain why this isn't the own you think it is...

Proving yourself to be the same type of elitist as the author. Eschewing morality because you want to portray yourself as unbias and neutral.

You are the same type of person who would blame jews for the holocaust. Disgusting.

&gt; ...because Russia ""won"" the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. He ""wanted"" something in that case, and he had the power/ability to get what he ""wanted.""

And we let him. NATO let him take over Georgia with not even 1 iota of actual help. Yet you Russian apologists devoid of morality still want to blame NATO.

&gt; Then. But that doesn't mean he has the power/ability to get everything he ""wants."" I really shouldn't have had to spell that out for you.

Funny because thats what Im attempting to explain to you. Again, what good reading comprehension you seem to have. Devoid of morality and reading comprehension. Thats a funny mix indeed.

So if NATO had already been stationing troops in Ukraine... Would putin have had the ability to get what he wants?????

Honestly, for someone who attempts to portray themselves as intelligent; you do a terrible job of understanding arguments.

&gt; So you want to bluff the Russians. Over Ukraine. Yeah, how about fuck no. Putin will call that bluff every single time.

&gt; We were never going to deploy troops in Ukraine to fight the Russians. Biden, Stoltenberg, everyone made that crystal clear. There was zero strategic ambiguity here.

Yes I understand Russian apologists are scared and cowardly. The appeasement you espouse is what got us where we are right now.

It wouldnt be a bluff... If anything 1/10th the size of NATO forces would be enough to repel any Russian invasion. Have you been following the Ukraine war at all?

So the only thing left for him would be nukes, and at which point NATO has all the responsibility in the world to protect Europe from Russian imperialism.

&gt; We were never going to deploy troops in Ukraine to fight the Russians. Biden, Stoltenberg, everyone made that crystal clear. There was zero strategic ambiguity here.

Yes, and Im making the argument that if we had; Putin likely wouldnt have invaded.

So perhaps NATO does bear some of the responsibility; in that it didn't go far enough. People like you wanted to give putin a chance, and he took every chance and threw it back at your face. People like me wanted to respond in kind.

We know that Russia only understands strength, and acquiescing to every previous red line from Putin has indicated to him that he can do what he wants with no real repercussions.

From that perspective, it is your arguments that NATO is somehow responsible and that we should be cautious is what got us here. Being cautious allowed Putin to think he could keep getting away with his Russian imperialist dreams.

&gt; Denying that is naïve.

Explain it then. Ive made my points, your argument so far is ""lol NATO also responsible"". I explained that Putin has massive ambitions and that he wants to go further. Evidence by his articles.

Your argument is ""but NATO"". Explain it or admit its meaningless.

&gt; I don't have the ability to peer into alternate universes, so of course I do not have any such ""evidence.""

Agreed. But you seem determined to say that what Putin wants is somehow NATOs fault. Its not. We bear responsibility.

&gt; Except it has been crystal clear since August 2008 that Putin views Georgian (and Ukrainian) membership in NATO as a red line. So yes, the author, I, and many others have been taking into account the actions of the actual leader of Russia; it is you who has not.

Yet people on my side have been saying that NATO needs to go further or Russia will fee like it can invade whoever it wants. Perhaps if we had already been stationing troops in Ukraine, Russia wouldnt have even invaded.

If anything NATO has not gone far enough to deter Russian imperialism.

&gt; I do not believe NATO expansion post-1991 was the problem per se. I believe the problem was NATO expansion to the exclusion of Russia. Now, if you believe that ""fundamentally,"" NATO is an anti-Russian alliance, okay. But you cannot have it both ways. You cannot in good faith simultaneously

[],False,,hughk,,,[],,,,text,t2_3cpvg,False,True,"Personally I rather disagree with this article. NATO membership was something very much in the background because any country joing would have to go through many reforms. The Ukrainian military was in a terrible state due to the corruption and the later, correctly proved assumption that many were too connected with the Russian Federation.

In 2014 the immediate threat that Putin was seeing was not so much NATO but the EU. He didn't want a new economic realignment because it is difficult for a country to maintain existing economic bties with non EU states. This was a particular problem in the steel producing areas as companies were frequently part of Industrial associations (Kombinats) created in Soviet times. So company A would make something, company B would process it and company would finish it. All well and good but company A and B are now in one country and company C is another, there is a lot of customs work. 

The responsible oligarchs didn't like this at all so pushed back via Putin. This doomed the association agreement under Yanukovych. This could possibly have been addressed with free trade areas or whatever, but Russia had decided rather trying to discuss the problem. Another issue is the immediate threat of having a democratic and corruption free country as a neighbour. Russian and Ukrainian people are close. More so than their other neighbours. Those with power always maintained that the lack of democracy, the corruption and nepotism was because it was the only way to govern Russia. If Ukraine was able to improve things it would threaten the status quo in Russia.

NATO was there in the background but it really wasn't a risk. It took the seizure of Crimea Donbass and Luhansk to remind Ukraine that its military was hopeless and it needed allies. So afterwards, the Russian parts of the military mostly departed to the Federation and the new military started talks with NATO and tentative reforms.

There were many issues with regards to corruption and nepotism and training so Ukraine wasn't really on the approach road but it had started. In any case, under Poroshenko, he was treading very softly with the reforms so as not to alarm the Russians too much and his own oligarchs.

Eventually Zelenskyy was elected on a  reform platform, but given the embedded issues it proved very hard for him to reform. He wanted to, but as another pointed out, he was too slow for the west but too fast for Putin. The irony is that if Zelenskyy comes out of this, he will be *much* more able to push through the needed reforms.",f25d9ac8633d23c7c96c7d9f1304e2784e553c99,True,False,,,,,0,1647791719,,0,{},i1ez9c2,False,t3_ti8ik4,False,True,t3_ti8ik4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti8ik4/nato_and_the_road_not_taken_condemning_putins_war/i1ez9c2/,1647791735,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647762919.0,

On the first one, while i accept this likely applies to many, i think a significant portion will be fully operable. Firstly, because if not, why capture at all? Safer and less hassle to destroy and leave in the field. Secondly, the number of anecdotes around russian logistics deeming fuel is a major issue for vehicle abandonment. That and simple fleeing. Also, levels if interoperability are unusual here due to the shared ussr roots: meaning repair and recommission is a variable at play. They likely have the right tyres and parts for many of the captured vehicles.

[],False,,elbapo,,,[],,,,text,t2_havtlv8,False,False,"This. I came here to say this. The thing which is more likely than major pushback is progressive russian tactical retreat, leading to reversal and or collapse. 

To assess the likelihood of this we need to be paying attention to relative attrition rates, before historical modus operandi or specific military structures (although both relevant). 

We probably do not have a firm grip on ukranian casualty rates and hardware, but we have a reasonably good idea of the russian losses and ukranian resupply and capture of russian hardware.

And that picture is absolutely terrible for russia. On NATO estimates (which are ~60%of ukranian), the russians have lost nearing 10% amassed force (minor extrapolation) kia in under 3 weeks. Applying a 2/1 ratio for casualities thats 30% out of action already. I would be shocked if this wasnt beyond anyone in the kremlins reasonable worst case scenario. Expecting the same rate of attrition to continue is probably not valid, however even at half this rate russia could have lost 50% of its fighting force at the two month mark, which really should start to bite in terms of their ability to hold up territory in terms of logistics alone.

We know resupplies from the west are very significant to say the least, and the captured russian hardware is currently higher than that of all recorded losses. Although the latter number is probably too low, its probably fair to say they arent short of hardware resupply given levels of interoperability.

So the real question is whose levels of casualties are most sustainable? I do not know the answer. But russia at time of writing appears only piecemeal reinforcement, and ukraine has thousands of civilians and foriegn fighters to add to the mix. As an earlier poster made the point, if ukraine is intensively training civilians this could make a big difference in a war of attrition like this. 

Just for the record, I do not see the endgame being all out attrition to the last man. That would be a human catastrophe. Even russian collapsing morale is more likely. But if that is the backstop position, russia is in an untenable position which becomes more tenouous over time, and the longer ukraine wears them down the dtringerntheir hand in any negotiated endpoint will be.",44e2b123da7b9eb70bc03e216a09549a91c6e2de,True,False,,,,,0,1647784820,,0,{},i1ejr9x,False,t3_ti1om9,False,True,t1_i1chbw7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti1om9/is_ukraine_capable_of_launching_a_major/i1ejr9x/,1647784834,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647756020.0,

I'd expect that a Ukrainian home defense brigade-sized formation can sustain far more casualties than a Russian motorized brigade and still be functional, so it really just depends. The best way to figure it out is try and parse out what the actual casualty percentages of these units are (which may be almost impossible to do), and figure out at what point for this specific conflict they stopped functioning.

Don't discount the fact that a unit can sustain minimal losses and still be ineffective. If they rely on a centralized command structure, just the destruction of C2 nodes could result in mass surrenders ala Iraq.

let's be honest here, very few people REALLY cares about the people of taiwan. pre 2019 hong kong was doing quite well and the peoples' freedoms and rights were actually respected, there was actual rule of law, and the government had a high degree of separation from the ccp. at the time, the best evidence available suggested that if taiwan simply agreed to re-unification, the taiwanese peoples' lives, including political freedoms, wouldn't be impacted. i don't remember anyone suggesting that taiwan should simply lay down arms because the bloodshed wouldn't be worth it.

the calculus has changed today of course. taiwan's fight is now one for the freedom of its people and it makes perfect moral sense to support them. but until somewhat recently that was NOT the case yet people still wanted to see them armed to the teeth.

What's missing in the pan-European security order is the role of American influence: 
  
&gt; The proper lesson to draw from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is that Europe must, at a measured but deliberate and demonstrable pace, move toward much greater self-reliance in defense, even if it eschews the more ambitious goal of “strategic autonomy.”  
   
&gt; ...    
   
&gt; Their basic point is that Europe can manage its own defense and should seek to do so gradually while preserving trans-Atlantic cooperation on a variety of fronts. In principle, this can be done within a reconfigured NATO or, eventually, without it.

A continental Europe without NATO is a Europe with less US influence. And one can certainly make an argument that it is not in the interest of the United States to have reduced influence in Europe. It is therefore in America's interest to preserve the relevance of NATO. If challenging Russia's security concerns is the chosen method, then so be it. Ukrainians are sacrifices the State Department is willing to make.

My argument is that once you factor in American influence, then you *cannot* acknowledge Russia's security concerns. To even open up the possibility of entertaining cause and effect (e.g., NATO expansion) would lend credence to Russian grievances and the US wouldn't want that.

[],False,,poincares_cook,,,[],,,,text,t2_uea8mi,False,False,"That's one hot take. Not saying it's impossible, but trying to predict endgame outcomes so early into the conflict is a fools errand. 

You're counting up numbers on a notepad without addressing deeper issues like logistics, moral and training.

Russia is pressed economically, the effects of which will start to manifest in the coming months to the general population (there's always a delay). This is doubly a thing to watch for as Russia is still in the early unquestioning patriotism phase that comes with new wars. But the support will decline some as the war progresses.

There is a shift in manpower, as the Russias are unwilling to call up massive amounts of reserves or initiate a draft. As long as this continues, Ukraine will come to dominate Russia in the manpower they can deploy to the conflict, while Russia scrapes the barrel. On the other hand, should Russia call in reserves, you're going to see a significant drop in moral and competence, that's when starting moral is already poor.

Lastly, the resources of the Russian army, while not finite, have a soft cap. Their production and ability to refubrish from rusting stock is slow and limited. They absolutely cannot afford a war at current rate of friction to last for many months. They've already lost more than 10% of their **total** armor in service. That's not just 10% of what's deployed to Ukraine, but total. Meanwhile Ukraine has access to basically limitless logistic support in form of AT rockets, ATGM's, SHORAD, rifles, ammunition and so on.

Better, the Ukrainians keep gaining new capabilities. Recently they've received thermals and NVG equipment. They are receiving the more advanced starstreak. And are now slated to receive the switchblade 300 drones. It's expected that Ukraine will get more and more advanced weapons as the war continues.

Yes, the Ukrainians are also suffering great attrition when it comes to armor, artillery, APC's and so on. But it's weapon systems they are leas reliant on, and their losses are at a lower rate than the Russia so far since these systems are less used by Ukraine in ongoing battles.",e6e672f04b9cdc8613c801c8d4cab1b4af60f0c6,True,False,,,,,0,1647765670,,0,{},i1dspo8,False,t3_ti1om9,False,True,t1_i1c93h2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti1om9/is_ukraine_capable_of_launching_a_major/i1dspo8/,1647765683,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647736870.0,

I really love writing, researching, and analysing, so I'm not too fussed about that. I'm lucky that it's a job I love. But yep, I've had to throw out some of my old writing! But I have some new opportunities for more writing. Some of my old hypotheses aren't relevant anymore. I had 4 broad categories of outcomes for the Ukraine crisis. 1) status quo where nothing really changes and neither Russia nor Ukraine do anything about Minsk. Ukraine becomes very connected to the West. Corruption slowly goes down. The Donbas front simmers down. It turns into like a Cyprus situation. 2) Russia triggers some crises and tries to strong-arm Ukraine into adopting its interpretation of the Minsk agreement. That would be very difficult because it'd essentially mean Russia would have to pry the West's support away from Ukraine. The completion of Nordstream 2 would be a big part of this equation, along with reform efforts in Ukraine, and public opinion in Ukraine. 3) Russia recognises the DPR/LPR, which gives Ukraine freedom to not implement Minsk, and makes its western trajectory very certain. It can keep claims on all the territory but not have to work to do anything. 4) dire escalation, more fighting on the front to pressure Ukraine. This would seal Ukraine's fate as being unreservedly pro-Western. It would be a point of no return. Total strategic loss for Russia. Turns out 4 came to be true(st) of them all.

[],False,,MercuryAI,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1rx2,False,False,"I think a certain amount of the article is crap.

First, I am a realist, but I'm not militant about it. My perception is that there is no single factor that overrides security considerations, and that international liberalism has its head up its butt in perceiving that the doctrine of survival is not the first one of any given state. Mutual benefits and international cooperation is useful for a lot of things (trade, criminal law, environmental regimes, etc), but I've never known of ANY state willing to sacrifice itself on the altar of principles.

Thus, when the author of this article speaks about a pan-European security order, he's ignoring that it's *largely* (but not wholly) interests over principles. The one part in which I think he's correct is that the US could have thought harder about the European security order after the collapse of the USSR. However, this was also a generation that was a little bit too close to the problem of nuclear war to think about it more coldly that quickly. 

Because it is largely interests over principles, you are not going to see a European security order that wants to have the U.S. out of it, and that's on both sides. From the European side, this is for three reasons - the cost of replacing the U.S. defense commitment, the U.S. as a guarantor (in the form of someone with a lot of weight that they can throw around if needed) of security of the various states within NATO (as opposed to defense against non-NATO states), and the technology benefits the member states receive from U.S. supplied weapons. While many European states may have the educational establishment to eventually create equivalent weapons (of those weapons they may have to give up), I think this is going to be a pain in the ass. From the U.S. side, most of the states that matter are in Europe (I am a far eastern specialist, btw, but I did study Eurasia as well). Most of the international regimes are through those countries, and they are collectively the largest economies. The U.S. would be a fool to give up their position at the helm of these regimes.

So, as far as the prospects for a new European security order go, one focused on Europe with less of a U.S. presence/reliance, Russia poses two unique challenges.

1) Modern Russia inherited the military (and nukes) that make it a great power in the classical sense (able to wage war against a neighboring country unaided).

2) Russia has a historical pattern of waxing and waning through various cycles of strongmen and liberalization. According to one professor of mine, there were five times in Russia's history where they could have broken that pattern, but were unable to. 

It's the combination of these two factors that make Russia extremely challenging to fit into any kind of pan-European security framework. 

First, that they are (well, maybe not, now) a great power means that ordinarily they may be welcome, but alliances are formed by states balancing against intent, not bandwagoning to forestall a threat. Second, the historical pattern of strongmen ruling Russia means that the threat Russia poses will be largely a question of who is ruling the state at that time. To put it bluntly, a pan-European security order would require a more stable state than Russia has been historically. If Russia were to be invited into a pan-European security order, it would not be out of the question that any particular strongman would seek to throw their weight around within it to get their way from the neighboring states. These states would likely cluster to balance against the neighborhood bully, much as they are currently, just with less of a U.S. guarantor. 

But, you might say, there are other states ruled by strongmen already within NATO! Yes, this is correct, but they are much smaller powers in comparison to the other states, and they don't have nukes. 

Thus, I think this author is a little bit blinkered when it comes to thinking about his security order. As a side note, I don't believe in international justice or fairness as a real organizing principle of international relations, for reasons that I discussed before - security trumps all. International justice and fairness really only flourish when security has already been achieved, and they are quickly abandoned when security is threatened. I think to rely on those principles is just to kid yourself.

And as another side note, if you want to understand Russia's policies, understand Putin. The thought of NATO as a genuine threat to Russia (threats are conceived of in the dimensions of capability and intent. NATO had no intent, and was unlikely to realistically have one in the future) doesn't seem to hold a lot of credibility as a reason - The author is correct in saying that a single cause of the Ukraine situation is crap. Rather, some of those who have written about Putin feel that he has a messianic mission to make Russia great again. This is largely about maintaining the world the way Putin thinks it should be, not necessarily the interests of Russia. This is both the advantage and disadvantage of the strongman: You just might be wrong about what your country really needs, and there's a single point of failure.

And also, Russia and China don't really care about each other a ton. Russia views the Chinese the way the U.S. view Mexicans (dey took er jerbs!), and the Chinese only care about what they can buy from the Russians, and in using them as a challenge against the West. The civilizations are extremely incompatible.

Well, it's like the idea of a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people"", ""police accountability"", or ""small and limited constitutional government"". They are very nice words to habitually repeat and occasionally used to whack on the heads of the misbehaving parties, but don't take it too seriously, too literally or try to be absolute with it. The power of the State starts and stops with the ability to scrape the resource of the population under its aegis, and dispense violence, both internally and externally.

War Making and State Making as Organized Crime, In Bringing the State Back In, edited by Peter Evans, et al., 169–87. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.

Between 19th century French Republican governments putting down attempted revolts, which involved Parisians building barricades and blocking traffics, by sending in the army, wheeling the cannons forward, blowing up the barricades, then sending in the French army to shoot and bayonet everyone who was still alive (basically, Les Miserables) and 21st century Canadian government putting down trucker protests, which involving blocking traffics with trucks, by sending in riot police and seizing properties, the difference is in *degrees* not *nature*. 

&gt; The idea that poor nations must endure, middle powers have responsibility, and great powers have privileges, is just a return to the ideas of colonialism and slavery. 

So it's Great Power politics and realists have been arguing that it have never really gone away and the difference is in degrees, not nature. It's analogous to French gendarmeries swapping out muskets and bayonets for tear gas and rubber bullets to put down internal revolts. The degrees are different, not the nature.

Putin's action this time goes too far on the *degree*, I don't argue about that; but the nature is the same. Lithuania punishes Bangladesh's abstain vote in the UN by blocking COVID vaccines aid and shipments to Bangladesh. Some number of Bangladeshis will die because of this; but it's not Lithuania sending gunboats to blow something up.

So I'm going to fundamentally address the claims that Kyiv cannot stand, tied generally to Russia's attempts to secure the major cities close to Russia's borders and that are in contention...

\-----------------------------------------

Here's the situation: It's on the onus of Russia to bring to bear the forces necessary to occupy and properly take over these cities. Not just for an ensuing insurgency, just taking them.

This is a tactical necessity for Russia. These cities are the hubs by which everything else in Ukraine is connected, and thus, can be taken. Russia, plainly and simply...cannot just ignore these places. It won't work. Even if the ground terrain wasn't muddy and consuming any Russian vehicles like a hungry monster, it's terribly vulnerable to cross these flat planes.

They initially moved in a force of 200K troops on the border. This was not intended to all be deployed; only half or so, because they thought it would be over and done in 3 days.

As the Russians started fucking up for various reasons, they needed to bring in the remaining troops on the border. So *all* of the troops needed to be brought to bear. A bunch of people who, by all unbiased indications, absolutely don't want to be there. Whatever motive they have for fighting is likely very detached from whatever reasoning is going through Russian televisions, or whatever they were told.

So, Russia has, roughly, 200K troops, obviously minus the casualties. Same for Ukraine. Intelligence from the UK and the US seem to agree that loss rates are equal on both sides, though in the case of Ukraine and vehicles, abandoned Russian equipment has been very helpful to Ukraine.

Ukraine had 200K troops at the start. Same as Russia.

They have 900K reservists, additional volunteers, both returning Ukrainians and other foreigners who have *gone to Ukraine* to fight the Russians.

In addition, they have no small amount of extremely pissed off civilians who want to throw flaming bottles of hot stuff at Russian vehicles. A lot of flaming bottles of hot stuff.

In order to take these cities, Russia has some fundamental choices to make here. 

\----------------------------------

**The options.**

Treat **every major city along the battle lines** the same way they've treated Mariupol**.** This will be time consuming and resource consuming even if the Russian Air Force got its shit together. This will encourage more sanctions and isolating of Russia, squeezing its economy even more. 

The problem with this strategy is that even if they do this *they still have to take these places.* The fundamental miscalculation of the Germans in WW2 when they bombed and shelled Stalingrad to shit, was that this would somehow make taking the cities easier. 

It didn't. And it came to a point where the Germans just...couldn't keep doing it. They just...couldn't. It wasn't *possible.*

All the same sort of urban operations will *still need to happen* to secure these locations. If he flattens the cities in an instant with nukes, he might be able to avoid this and just...move over them, but at that point, Russia would probably even lose China as a partner. They very much care about the optics, and deciding to have even minor economic ties to a power flattening cities out of desperation that has no other international support probably would be enough to even abandon Russia. China doesn't need Russia. It's not a hard choice for them.

But let's say they skip the indiscriminate destruction because they realize it'd be a bad idea. They're still in a pickle.

They still have to take these cities. Same problem. 900K reservists, 200K active troops, god knows how many civvies with Molotov cocktails.

So, they can choose to bring the required amount of troops necessary for an occupation. I don't remember the exact numbers, I just know the force they brought with them was something like 4 to 5 times smaller than it needed to be. Now, Russia has been having significant logistical issues, which will only get worse in time for various reasons (lost equipment, sanctions). Can Russia politically, military, economically deploy something like a million troops to Ukraine at all once? 

Grant them a month to mobilize here.

Again, they have to deal with sanctions and the ongoing combat. They have to get all these troops to the frontlines, they have to avoid traffic congestions. They have to avoid the home front going to dogshit because of these choices.

Given how Russian logistics have performed with only a force of 200K, what's the chances that logistically they can up their force to a million and still be functional on the field to actually take these cities, like Kyiv?

Probably pretty low.

Let's say they compromise. They only double their numbers, avoid indiscriminate preliminary bombardment, and go block by block.

A bunch of people who hate that they're even there, against the numbers of people I've just laid out...who, while they do not want to fight, probably hate the occupiers more than they hate the prospect of fighting.

All with sanctions and active loss of equipment and resources at the current rates.

It's possible Russia can take these places.

But here's the thing...how many things have to go right, in a proper time frame, for that to happen? What does Ukraine need to do to upset these attempts?

Ukraine's not guaranteed a victory here. But taking Kyiv alone is a monstrous undertaking given the circumstances.

It can go a number of ways, but a lot...a lot...has to go right for Russia to take and hold these places.

Is it a better choice for Ukraine to hold Kyiv and the cities or move the frontlines back and restart the fight? I frankly don't know.

But given the present circumstances, I would expect 3 months minimum of combat in the cities to take these places, being generous.

...The question then is, at the current pace of war, can Russia actually do that? And right now I'd give Russia a 50/50 shot at that, with the win being incredibly...incredibly costly and difficult.",ce14cbce97da88e6bc7324f2f088a2840dbca5c9,True,False,,,,,0,1647747756,,0,{},i1d4fq5,False,t3_ti1om9,False,True,t1_i1cr91o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti1om9/is_ukraine_capable_of_launching_a_major/i1d4fq5/,1647747773,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647718956.0,

The ideas may be compelling and make sense to a degree, but any world order that does not respect the inalienable individual, or national, right to do what ever they want with themselves is something that I cannot get behind.

But doesn't this hold in the other direction? I am thinking of this paragraph:

&gt;Ukraine was thus left to knock on the alliance’s door for nearly fourteen years. Still, the possibility that it might be allowed in was enough to stoke Russian fears, and that increasingly exposed Ukraine to danger. Meanwhile, NATO had no serious intention of guaranteeing Ukraine security through membership. In short, Kyiv was left in limbo. That (non-)decision was a mixture of cowardice and strategic irresponsibility, one for which Ukraine has paid a terrible price, while NATO has paid none at all. Seen this way, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s anger at the alliance, reflected in his speech at the February 2022 Munich Security Conference, becomes understandable.

Had Ukraine at some point (likely, but not necessarily, before Zelensky became president) declared its ""permanent neutrality"" (what Austria did in 1955 as part of Soviets leaving, preventing a Germany-like division), this might have been enough to prevent the Russian invasion.

I do not know whether this is true, but then neither does anyone else. My point is that Ukraine had the freedom to do this as much as it had to pursue a NATO membership that it had absolutely no possibility in the indefinite future to obtain.

&gt;The ideas may be compelling and make sense to a degree, but any world order that does not respect the inalienable individual, or national, right to do what ever they want with themselves is something that I cannot get behind.

Realism is similar to the word ""reality"" for a reason. I oppose the notion that ""healthcare is a human right"" because, apart from economic considerations, I reject the idea that I am entitled to the product of someone else's time and effort. A country is free to pursue its goals, but it is not entitled in the abstract sense to expect another country's funds/protection/aid simply for existing.

Maybe there are factors in play which we don't know about.  But increasingly, to me, it looks like a 'sometimes you eat the bear condition'-  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgdsZJTf9dw  
Is playing out now, about the way you would expect it to.  And of course what is worrisome there is the notion that Ukraine has been used, very badly, as a Bear Chew Toy.  
Looking to blunt or cripple Russian economic growth using 'diplomatically' dropped-hints and trigger words like 'NATO Membership should be a path open to all' (November 10, 2021) at a time when Russians were already gathering their forces to prevent a sudden polarity shift in one of the CIS substates they cannot afford to lose.  
Obviously, the Ukrainians have been treated very badly, given the present condition was predictable and probably sought, from 1994 and the Budapest Agreement, onwards.  We made a promise that we couldn't and wouldn't keep, based on historical American Precedent for running away from Eastern European 'Cry Freedom!' revolutions in place.  
But what is worse is when the Eagle swoops in and begins to rip open the Bear's last moments, based on Sanctions and irreparable combat losses, inflicted by CAG/CAD USOF, not Ukrainians, in this war.  Because the bear has a nuclear hand grenade linked to a Perimeter heartbeat monitor.  
I guess it doesn't matter, but let me state something that has come to me from forty odd years of studying the operational art: there is a rhythm to battle.  In losing, in winning, in the transitions inbetween.  If you obey that rhythm, regardless of casualties, defending by little victories \_to buy time\_, until you can no longer hold off defeat.  Then allowing the enemy to 'be the bear' and run itself out of victor's disease relief as much as steam, until it gets sloppy and bored and angsty and longs to go back over the mountain.  
That is the half-beat tempo moment when you can start to reverse the rhythm and begin beating it again.  As you start to win.  
Before you go under, you build assets, you establish hide sites and caches.  You stand up reliable guerilla force leadership and cadre teams from ex-SOF who have gone to ground and, assuming you have an ally that gives a damn and doesn't turn away when it seems hopeless, you start to set up opplans which will, gradually, district by region, begin to direct-action take away control from the threat.  1-2-3.  Furious Defense, Defeat to Planned Occupation, Fight Back.  This is a minimum 10 year insurrection as guerilla campaign.  It won't be something that can be sound byted on CNN for a few weeks.  So you need to stop trying to appeal to that crowd, however much your actor's nature wants it.  
The key here is to have a secure, defendable, secondary National Redoubt as fall back.  Not just a government in exile but a place which gives sovereign territory ownership of a political as much as real territorial landscape.  
So that a Texas Dream doesn't die at the Alamo but is amplified by it.  
'HEY!  We're still here!  Don't you dare pretend we're not!'  
Humiliate anyone who said they were your (fair weather) friend.  But will not be your ally.  Invite them to roll in heavy armor and form up on you.  Tell them that the Russians are coming and if they want to lay waste to their advance, across an open battlespace, with airpower, YOU WILL CERTIFY IT.  As the head of state of Ukraine.  
I don't think Kyiv can be held.  I think it will become a mass grave.  If it isn't already.  I think that a responsible leader who is looking at MILLIONS DEAD in a megalopolis urban center cannot fail to fall back, declare the Open City and allow the support and maintenance of that city center become the public and international responsibility of the occupier.  Their's to be criticized for their every failure.  
This frees up forces to maneuver again.  This recreates more Forward Defense operational depth to start using those X-600 10km Switchblades and 4km Javelins and 2km Stugna-P and who knows, maybe even some 25km Spike-NLOS.  
Which makes everything from the Dnieper West a free fire zone.  
I think Zelensky is a moron politician who doesn't know he is being used to thousand-cuts the Russians, drowning them with the blood of his own people.  
I sure hope I'm wrong.  
Because a back-against-wall, last man standing, die hard defense, of Kyiv doesn't buy Ukraine anything but crushed morale, a dead hero President no hope for an organized defense.  
Staying in the fight does.  
And first and foremost, that means being open to an honest assessment of the operational picture, your force assets in it and how far East you can still influence the tactical battlespace vs. how many days it will take to withdraw and begin a movement which saves that which is saveable, on a newly shortened defensive line.  
Wake up Zelensky.  Spare your people, conserve your forces, establish a rump state, retain a presence on the global stage.  By your own initiative, not Russian defeat of your regime.

Before beginning attack and fade operations with helicopters defining the approach to contact interval of heavy shaping and attrition until they were body slammed by the bulk of the division at a given Schwerpunkt.  Giving the defense time to mass and destroy the threat thrustline.  
It was this hybrid system which we took into Iraq and just trashed the Iraqi army with.  
One of the reasons I think the present conflict was either designed for Ukraine to lose or designed to force an American intervention to avoid a loss is that Ukrainian forces were just hammered in 2014.  This was a forced error slaughter in that 'don't escalate!' they were denied secure comms, body armor, UAV and fire finder radars which would have let them counter the Russian presence, aiding the 'freedom fighters' of the Donbass separatists.  And so lost huge numbers of armor, AFV, artillery and softskins which were simply never replaced.  You see this in the state of Ukrainian Orbats, pre and post 2014.  U  2008, they had five armor brigades.  In 2020, they had one.  The 17thABr.  Today, they have a bunch of 'reserve' units which do not correspond to the 2014 era equivalents and nobody knows whether these have vehicles assigned and how well trained their constituent troops are, in terms of fuel and rounds expended to bring them up to capacity.  
If the Ukrainians had significant armor, our response would have been different, in terms of both weapons systems supplied and tactical advisement (and yes, SOCOM are on the ground, 'advising' Zelensky).  
\&gt;&gt;  
Is Ukraine capable of launching a major counteroffensive at this time?  
  
I came across an interesting claim that over the recent week the Russians have significantly stepped up their air and rocket attacks on Ukrainian military infrastructure in the west of country, because they want to delay intensive preparations for a potential ground assault into the Donbass and Crimea.  
Considering that mobilization has been going on for some time, the flood of weaponry and volunteers from neighboring nations ever increasing and the Ukrainians able to keep a sizable part of their armored reserve intact so far,   
...  
  
If the war has not ceased at this point, it would be amazing if the Ukrainians actually have the arms and logistics to move beyond that.  
\&gt;&gt;  
In 1941, it cost the Germans 800,000 men to bring Barbaross to Moscow's gates and another 400,000 to take Taifun through to early January.  Thanks to a bunch of compounding idiocies (logistical depth, war of annihilation, operational redirect to secure the capture of Kyiv over Leningrad...) Hitler did not do what had made him so successful in Poland and Belgium and France.  Bridging, Bypassing, Surrounding, Shelling while sustaining operational momentum with staged pauses and pass throughs as units reequipped and rearmed to continuously carry the fight forwards.  
And yet despite having almost no time to prepare when the change to complex terrain fighting in an urban zone slowed their advance to a crawl, and given the Soviets held onto the rail head that allowed them to detrain entire divisions of fresh troops; the Germans were not thrown off the Capital's doorstep.  Despite bitter cold and vicious fighting by constant waves of Soviet winterized counter attack.  
They had the long gun interlocks of indirect fire.  They had the fire discipline to retain ammunition.  And they had the German Ubermensch sense of Eastwards Longing as 'destiny fulfilled' to carry them through starvation and frostbite and weapons the increasingly would not even fire or start, because of the cold.  It's not like they were going to run anywhere...  
In 1944, during the hard pull back from the Baltic States, two Tiger tanks held up an entire column of Russian armor, moving down the single, coastal, highway.  One Tiger was eventually lost but the other achieved something like 50 threat vehicle kills in the winding, narrow, roads with marshland to one side and forests to the other.  Much like the terrain on the M01, south from the border to Kyiv.  With tank riders and Javelin (anti-helicopter as well as anti-armor) the Ukrainians could have done even better, did they but have the 'we'll get the lead tanks, you wipe out the BMP/BTR and infantry...' forces to employ.  
 With these two conditional examples, it was very stupid to let the Russians gain an operational foothold and begin to improve (field fortify) a defensive bastion with GMTI and stockpiling rounds as defense in depth to artillery positions which can shoot and scoot between multiple fighting position as they shell the snot out of Ukrainian civilian positions.  
Yes, the Russians have been standing still.  
No.  The Ukrainians have not been able to exploit that with aggressive artillery and counter maneuver.  And you should be highly suspicious of that.  Because, unlike the Germans outside Moscow, it signifies an acknowledgement that the Russians can own the battlespace by denying it to everyone else, using ISR driven network artillery fires.  
While the ZSU will eventually begin to lose the respect of the Ukrainian people by 'everyone who stays is a soldier' bringing the battle to a high density urban zone and then failing to counterstroke the Russian gone-to-ground threat before it causes mass starvation as much as casualty.  
If nothing else, the Ukrainians are now making \_themselves\_ predictable because they have to be within a given distance and force ratio unit size to take the Russians who now have building stocks of ammunition and routine overhead UAV/Satellite coverage.  
There will be no hiding such a company or battalion level force.  Even in the Festung ruins of Kyiv itself, which will increasingly serve as a trap for all forces committed to it's defense.  
 Zelensky is putting on a brave face, touting every victory and smothering every loss, while saying nothing to justify how increasingly fewer Russian sorties are lost and increasingly more Ukrainians are killed.

Well the rebels and Isis in Syria did a great job at resisting government advances with their guerilla tactics. It's when they made counter attacks that Russian air power came to shine, obliterating entire units instantly.  
\&gt;&gt;  
The Syrians kicked the rebel's asses for three reasons:  
1.  American Airpower was hamstrung.  There are multiple (Russian) radio intercepts of A-10 and F-16 pilots all but screaming to their controlling agencies: ""Black flags, gun armed technicals, 20+ vehicles, why can't I kill these bastards?!"" For which there are really only two operational justifications:  U.S. geopolitical interests were served by having a destabilizing force in the region which justified our presence there.  Or...  USOF, \_cosplaying\_ as ISIS were driving around ISIS controlled regions, doing the nasty to ISIS or non-aligned rebel groups.  It probably doesn't matter which.  
2. The Russians were staging Special Operations from within Wagner PMC and Russian Army compounds.  Spetz troops (who will become Wagner, in another 10 years) were spanking the appropriate people based on SR level close observation and attack.  Long before primary Russian armed forces were in-theater.  
3. Russian Doctrine is comprehensive.  First you spend a month or three to EOB map the entire region with particularly emphasis upon assigning personalities to given COMINT patterns.  Then you kill or recruit leaders.  Then you use selective artillery and missile and bombing strikes to rip out their operational centers, driving them to 'holding pens' in a given city which you encircle and starve/shell.  Then you create 'humanitarian corridors' and deliberately allow disarmed groups to return to regions where they are isolated and resourceless or/and locked amongst their own where they are hesitant to do the things they do to other regional groups.  Lest they bring down hell upon themselves and their tribal populations.  Like a street gang that hesitates to rape and pillage their own hood.  The Russians are very good at 'whatever you want, in your own zone', controlling ethnic groups by splitting up and containing them as regionally isolated sub-populations.  
\&gt;&gt;  
Based on their track record, I'd say Russia has the most success when facing counter offensives, so they can draw out a defending foe.  
\&gt;&gt;  
Less 'drawing them out' than forcing a contact until the defenders have a break or bypass moment and then going for the Deep Attack to cut off their divisional rear areas while using artillery to rototill pocketed defenders left behind.  
As Bagration showed, when the Russian Juggernaut has enough forces to bleed to the point of breakout they can be an awesome threat.  
During the 1970s, the U.S. Army encouraged a few of the aging German generals to come talk to them at tactics conferences.  As former members of the Heer, with some having also helped stand up the Bundeswehr, they proved competent at the operational art but it was their understanding of the Russian system of operations which shocked the USAr commanders.  
They 'must think in Russian' better than the Russians did.  
Mind you, men like Balck and Von Mellenthin, while not well known in the West, were some of the best of the best, line commanders, even in the German's eyes.  Balck was twice offered a position at the Kriegsakademie to teach and gain high level training necessary to join the OKW strategic planning staff but chose to remain a field general and got his Knight's Cross the hard way.  
With the result that he took a single, beat up, division (11Pz) and, with less than 20 tanks, running, destroyed 1,000 enemy tanks and the better part of two tank armies, in 30 days of fighting to secure the German southern flank so that 6th Army could be withdrawn from Stalingrad.  Didn't work, but it wasn't for want of Balck's 'midnight marches save dawn dead'.  Absolutely brilliant, unflappable, master of the operational art that fought a 24hr operations cycle, like it was nothing, in 1942.   
When shown tactical setups from the Sinai and Golan, as well as classified plans leaked out from Western Forces plans in the GDR, and some of the WWII era historical period based on combat after action analysis taken from the OKW and OKH Oste archives in 1945, the German Schoolmasters taught their skills to the American class.  
From the reports, the Americans did not understand how the Russians had been so successful in WWII yet the Russian system translated so poorly to the Middle East and elsewhere.  And yet, from a look at the sand table, the Germans immediately knew what the Russian operational /intent/ was and were able to show the Americans how the Soviet model worked.  As well as what standard Heer tactics involved.  
Basically, the Russian model was based around bunching like a snake behind a carefully staged artillery plan, slamming into the front lines with maximum shock and firepower to breach the forward line of defense and pass through smaller formations which then went hell for leather as deep as they could before going to ground.   
The German counter was to have multiple forward screens/strong points like a crumple zone barrier in an automobile and use these strong points or small maneuver elements to absorb the blunt shock and deflect the force deeper in, towards an infantry held deep killsack.  Before falling in upon the lead formations and setting a chair over the head of the snake to decapitate it and, as the snake coiled up on itself, run a lawnmower up the dying offensive's back.  
Their emphatic belief was that it was incredibly important to understand the /psychology/ of the Russian mind and how, while vicious and tenacious in defense, once deprived of leadership and struck from behind the lead elements, they quickly lost operational cohesion.  They were a nation of serfs who had descended into Communism, not because they thought it was the best system but because it fell into line with their natural communal subordinate natures, which had literally been bred into them, across centuries of hammering the nails which dared to stand up under the Tsarist system.  
As a result, they were terribly vulnerable when denied centralized control.  Not all were this way, the STAVKA reserve exploitation units were a notable exception.  But the majority were.  Because they repeated the same mistakes, over and over and over again.  
The German system was based upon elite, small or large (Battalion kampfgruppe, Regimental lanzenspitz) formations, usually mechanized, sometimes motorized, initially on the offense;  which encircled and annihilated and later, on the defense, which counter stroked to flank and cut to pieces, the Russian armor force, in support of disrupting these operational psychologies.     
The Germans played the Russians and beat the Americans, black and blue.  The Germans then played the Germans, and 'deepened the bruise' beating the Americans playing the Russians.  And each time, they insisted only that the American's explain their thought processes inherent to what a give stimulus or opportunity caused them to react in a given way.  In this, they taught the Americans how to be much more guarded in their own intent.  
Then the Americans played the Americans, using Western Front tactics which were cellular and depended on light formations (of infantry) deflecting and delaying the onslaught of mechanized unit advance with light antitank weapons until heavy armor/artillery/air could be brought to bear and the Germans were much easier to contain, offensively but, playing as Russians, still achieved operational advantage as soon as they broke out and had the attritional LER depth of reserves to absorb the initial 'hammer to hammer' shock of contact and simply out-shove the Americans until that displacement breach of our lines happened anyway.",30a7b284629406b7e83bf42487c59c712fd9c8a9,True,False,,,,,0,1647740695,,0,{},i1cr2ff,False,t3_ti1om9,False,True,t1_i1by4p0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti1om9/is_ukraine_capable_of_launching_a_major/i1cr2ff/,1647740707,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647711895.0,

&gt; Chinese special operations would also have to reconcile the imperative for small, clandestine operations behind enemy lines with a desire for unified command under the joint command construct. Generally, there is a tension between the Leninist emphasis on centralization and the need to grant autonomy to lower PLA commanders. This could be especially problematic in special operations: centralized command could lead to poor performance if small units fail to act due to the lack of explicit authorization, or if they are forced to maintain radio communications and thus reveal their positions to the enemy. Evidence from training or updated doctrine could offer signs of whether SOF teams are given adequate autonomy in the field.

Ukraine isn't really in a position to do the first one.

They have a lot of small groups of infantry that can move around fast, strike lots of different targets, and then disappear. Taking back a lot of territory and trying to hold it would rob them of a lot of  dynamism.

The second is what they've proven to be experts at and the Russian forces aren't developing tactics to counter it fast enough.

The Russian casualties for this phase of the war is already higher than all of US casualties for it's 20 years of GWOT.
