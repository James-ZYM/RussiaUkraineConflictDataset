I feel like this is a much more complex issue than you are making it out to be. First, China (and most authoritarian countries) have enough control over media that non-government messages about the state of the nation are rarely heard or given credence. Why am I dissatisfied with the direction of my country if everyone is always telling me that the direction is excellent? It is a design feature of authoritarianism that the news about the state of the nation is always positive, even when encountering difficulties.

Furthermore, in western countries there is constant information warfare going on between different interests who seek to gain political favor of the public. This incentivizes negativity about the current direction of the country, because interests can not make changes they prefer if the public feels that there is no need for such changes. A free society is necessarily going to include dissenting views about the direction of the country, and holders of those views will engage in information campaigns to change others to their view.

This makes democracies a more day-to-day emotionally tiring place to live, but it also allows for the exposure of many different ideas, some of which are good, and some of which are not. Ultimately though, there is a lot of pressure to find the best ideas.

&gt;The regimes in the Western world constantly push through agendas that don't enjoy any semblance of democratic mandate from the people (e.g. deindustrialization), while ignoring issues where the democratic mandate is overwhelmingly clear (e.g. tax evasion by corporations)

This is a more populist take on democracy than the constitutional republics that western nations try to be. Taxing corporations for example is popular, but the average citizen is ignorant of the net effects of this, which often turns out to be in creased prices to consumers. Western nations have always feared ""mob"" rule, and many of them have protections built in to protect minorities and institutions for this very reason.

Also, the idea that leaders can be held accountable to the public is also not authoritarian. When a dictator gives a tax break to his brother's corporation, there is no recourse. A western leader though can quickly find themselves out of office and imprisoned for such a thing.",7d3b63ea381e6e8c24e2aae9ba19a79d0b0e0ddc,True,False,,,,,0,1651267128,,0,{},i6prcoe,False,t3_uefckh,False,True,t1_i6onz09,/r/geopolitics/comments/uefckh/xis_global_security_initiative_looks_to_counter/i6prcoe/,1651267139,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651238328.0,[],text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,

Its not for people to decide whether democracy is about some abstract ideal of freedom or not. Its not. Neither is authoritarianism a governance style to address more basic needs. Those are misleading narratives, harmful to informed choice and actual self-determination.

Democracy is a set of flawed but pragmatic compromises with the foremost goal of preventing extreme concentrations of power and the systematic everyday abuses that have always followed. 

And authoritarianism is not unfree-democracy, where everyone consents to different values because they agree on something else. Thats part of the propaganda. Authoritarianism is just the means for personal ambition.

I am not arguing for anything besides that, certainly not foreign interventionism or constant bloodshed.

We rely on the continued consensus that democracy is best in order for democracy to keep functioning. That is why it's so dangerous when we continue to trash our democratic freedoms.

Arguably it's entirely unfair to ban fascist/neonazis parties from existing, but we accept it because there is a broad political consensus for it but more importantly because it advocates the oppression of the rights of others.

First of all...the US stationing nuclear weapons in South Korea does a hell of a lot more than ensure MAD for the Korean Peninsula vis a vis the North/South divide. It directly threatens China, and there is a very significant chance that China will see this as a direct threat to their security, and take steps to immediately escalate before it becomes a reality. 

Secondly, the sanctions exist because the North represents a challenge to the Western sphere of influence in East Asia and a check against the northern bastion of the US first line of containment against China in the Pacific. Nuclear weapons occured after the fact and are designed for the purpose of preventing forceful regime change by external parties. Its not like the North Koreans weren't already being sanctioned by the US prior to developing nuclear capabilities.

Nobody invading North Korea is a nice concept, but doesn't hold weight in the post cold war world with the US track record of forceful regime change in the Middle East, the Balkans and their influence in Colour Revolutions the world over. In theory, its a terrible idea for the west (for a litany of reasons, most relating to how China would perceive it), but in practice, the North Korean government would be irresponsible to trust the West at their word that an intervention is not on the menu.

It's natural for sovereign developing nations to build up deterrence, which is what Indonesia is doing. They are also simultaneously developing deeper and greater trade relations with China and have rejected joining any pro US bloc. Vietnam is similar, as is most of the region. They are apprehensive of China but not interested in becoming Ukraine for the US. Vietnam literally just announced a joint military training with Russia, the day after the US suggested upgrading their partnership. That's a clear message. The dynamic in the region is complex but it's not ""China is Hitler"". Seriously, see the reactions of the global south to the Ukraine war and the western sanctions - it's not pretty for the US. They are not going to be getting any NATO equivalents in the region at all. They will be a power to balance. But all the major countries (other than us client states like Japan and Australia) are carefully balancing the US and choosing independent defense vectors (which is why China is also in favor of Russia - Russia is an alternative military hardware supplier that doesn't require you to surrender parts of your sovereignty for jets). 


Do you know how long the China India issue has been happening? It didn't start yesterday. This is what i mean by media manipulation. They've had this dispute for 70 years at least and there is repeated back and forth from both sides. Every spring they go and claim different hills and features, do build ups when the the others do and fight (with fists). If you actually look at latest conflagration you can tell it was an accident - both sides fought in a ravine and died when they fell in. It's a period of heightened tensions yes, but still just a period. In all these 70 years, China is still India's #1 partner and the neighbors have limited the conflict (removing weapons from the zone etc). Right now, the chances for a detente between India and China are extremely high due to Ukraine issue and the unipolar vs multiolar debate which India and China are on the same side of. 

Do you even know what the crux of the issue is? China simply wants Aksai Chin to be recognized by India as part of china. They took it forcibly in 1962 as it is geographically essential to connect Tibet and Xinjiang. Deng offered India an official recognition of their borders in exchange for just Aksai Chin - Nehru refused for nationalist, democratic reasons. Aksai Chin is like Crimea - a fait accompli that India won't get back. China has also suggested negotiations historically but India has denied it as it is part of Kashmir and wants to settle the Pakistan part too.  This disputed territory is literally some empty land in the Himalayas. 

And FWIW, look China's borders - in Mao's times they had unsettled borders with all 14 bordering neighbors. They have settled peacefully (and fairly - they conceded territory multiple times) with all these countries, including Russia and Vietnam. India and Bhutan remain the only issues still on the docket. 

India is absolutely not in a loose alliance with the US. The quad is nothing more than a piece of paper (again its media manipulation). India's relations with all the quad nations remains more or less the same - friendly, good business ties, some symbolic military purchases.  Prior to the war, the US had been using the quad to gain a new customer of military hardware, which India has refrained from. If you read all statements put out by the all parties over time, India has explicitly refrained from turning it into an anti China alliance and has repeatedly try to emphasize more economic deals between the quad (tried to use it to distribute covid vaccines). The current Russo-Ukranian war has ended any hopes of the quad being major. India has defacto announced support for Russia and American congressman have threatened India with sanctions, started playing the human rights card etc - have a single look at Indian media and you will see the fury at being ""lectured"" by the West. 

Seriously, read what Chinese say about their defenses and plans - you can call it propaganda but it is their views. They still view gun boat diplomacy and control of their coast as the greatest threat to China. When the west talks about China growing too much or developing quickly, they view that as an attack on Chinese civilization - because the problem is that they are not ""poor enough"". Combine this with constant military drills, freedom of navigation ops, and their military building makes sense. Unless you believe only America has a right to do that. There is 0 mention of hegemony or dominating the world. The most aggressive Chinese nationalists want Taiwan and then a Latin American style relationship.

Which is why the most successful nations in the world today and historic are democratic and why the biggest predictor of a society in decline or collapse is if it's authoritarian in nature.

History shows us that authoritarianism just doesn't work from a pragmatic perspective. They *always* collapse in the end. There's probably some great formulation out there that authoritarian governments don't face internal competition and thus stagnate at domestic statecraft which allows democratic contemporaries to out-compete them and outpace them in the long term.

We're not arguing that authoritarianism is inherently evil and therefor shouldn't be done. We're arguing that authoritarianism is inherently *incompetent* and therefor shouldn't be done. It's just a system that has been proven by history to produce subpar results.

Athens as a city state outcompeted non-democratic city states. Rome as a republic outcompeted other latin cultures that were autocratic. Chinese dynasties that were more democratic (like the Han) outcompeted other Chinese dynasties that were more authoritarian.

You see the same pattern emerge all throughout history. Democracies are agile and adapt to external pressures more effectively while also (admittedly slowly) adjusting due to internal competition from competing political forces. Meanwhile authoritarian systems stagnate with time, react very poorly to external pressures and almost never adjusts to internal pressure after consolidation.

These countries have strong vested interests in each other and have mostly abandoned major conflict. Even the current ""conflict"" is using water cannons on each other. Indonesia captured and blew up illegal Chinese fishing boats - nothing happened. Most of these ""provocations"" are media manipulation. 


The entire SCS strategy is solely related to countering the US sixth fleet (a formidable foe). China has essentially now created a small buffer so that the US cannot treat it like any other country (save Russia) - aka bomb it to smithereens using carriers off the coast. But even then, the first island chain is essential to be counter the US, which in recent years (especially Ukraine) has shown a willingness to incite conflict. This is known by all of the region which is why the reaction to AUKUS in the ASEAN was muted because they see it as a step towards Ukraine style provocations (which is if we are being honest). 

India and China's conflict has nothing to do with the south China Sea and is easily resolvable - the bigger problem is the China Pakistan relationship. Beyond that China and India are not going to war over de marcated territory in the Himalayas. They may do build, postures, skirmishes but in general have proven themselves to be mature actors with respect to escalation.

Australia is a defacto extension of the US at this point, trying to be the new UK. Japan is definitely in a tough place - that island either needs to be THE regional power or allied to it because it's highly dense, resource poor island, reliant on naval trade.",80fd43a54342146199c582caa476ae8001bcb40b,True,False,,,,,0,1651228336,,0,{},i6ne195,False,t3_uefckh,False,True,t1_i6ncnyc,/r/geopolitics/comments/uefckh/xis_global_security_initiative_looks_to_counter/i6ne195/,1651228348,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651199536.0,[],text,t2_rqa20,False,False,

Because India, Japan, Australia are independently powerful enough, they do not agree to this unilateral determination of shipping rights. These disputes also extend to land borders.

[],False,,ScroungingMonkey,,,,,,"While I do think that it is good to consider opposing views to the general triumphalism in the discourse around Ukraine, I think that this piece overestimates Putin's capabilities, underestimates Western resolve, and crucially, underestimates the agency of the Ukrainians themselves.  Western nations have continued to increase their weapons shipments to Ukraine, including escalating from shoulder-fired weapons to armored vehicles and artillery.  Meanwhile, Russia's capacity to manufacture new munitions and mechanized vehicles to replace their battlefield losses is limited.  In addition, Russia is using far more of their own troops on the ground than they were in Syria, and their ability to train high-quality troops to replace their losses (as opposed to poorly trained conscripts) is also limited.  

Put simply, I think that the side fooled by their own overconfidence in this conflict was Russia.  Russia was always weak compared to the West on fundamentals (economy and population), but they punched above their weight by a clever strategy of always staying just a little bit below the threshold of what would trigger widespread outrage in Western political discourse.  Putin has now trampled far over that threshold, and so he is now facing the fundamental weakness of his position all along.  The capacity of the US and European nations to supply weapons to Ukraine is far greater than the capacity of Russia to manufacture their own weapons.  Most importantly, the motivation of the Ukrainians fighting for their own independence and national identity is far higher than the motivation of Russian soldiers fighting for foreign conquest and the opportunity to rape civilians.  The Ukrainians are not going to stop fighting any time soon, nor is the West going to stop sending them arms any time soon.  

I don't know what the long-term outcome of this conflict is going to be, but Ukraine has already far exceeded expectations.  At the beginning of this invasion, Russia expected to seize Kyiv and impose a puppet government within a matter of days, and most Western experts agreed that they would be able to do so.  Putin started this war with maximalist rhetoric calling Ukrainian national identity fictitious.  It was obvious that his initial war aim was to destroy Ukraine as an independent state and to destroy Ukrainianness as an identity.  That maximalist goal is clearly out of reach for him now.  The best that he can realistically hope to achieve at this point is to expand the territory of his puppet states in the Donbas and create a land bridge to occupied Crimea, and even those pared-down goals are far from guaranteed.",66ad864c8b17f92b97b6be8223f7318acc08b812,True,False,,,,,0,1651226574,,0,{},i6nbt38,False,t3_udkzg2,False,False,t3_udkzg2,/r/geopolitics/comments/udkzg2/whats_putins_next_move_look_to_syria/i6nbt38/,1651226586,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651197774.0,[],text,t2_wq606nq,False,False,

Fair point. But China aside, autocratic systems have only resulted in maintenance of poverty and enrichment of elites/cadres, which continue to immigration pressures since disparities across countries continue (market forces are definitely at play but they look like mass economic migrations from poor to rich countries). 

My understanding of the American view about democracies is that a system that allows transfer of power between competing factions preceded by public debate and representation (voting) would - in the long run - improve countries.

Once it was clear that sanctions and some limited military aid inflowing to Ukraine was ceiling of his external risk, invasion following exactly as anticipated under those conditions. 

Alternatively, the build up was a show of force, putin issued some demands, the west/zelensky called his bluff and putin felt compelled to take drastic action because ideologically he saw no other option.

Invasion was a 'last resort' contingency imo. Hence why supposedly it had been discussed at a very high level but none of the troops knew anything about it. The idea that invasion was always the plan just strikes me as pretty silly wishful thinking. 

I'd imagine it's similar to Georgia, where the US encouraged them to be confrontational with Russia with the implication that they'd protect them. Zelensky took a 'hard stand' against Russian demands thinking he could get away with it and the bluff failed.

Chinese actions to date are solely about countering US hegemonic control of their own coastline. They don't seek world domination, nor to tear up the international system. They do however seek a rebalancing of the international system. 

They can only be interpreted as confrontational if you believe that the US has a right to control what happens on the other side of the planet. Similarly any move towards a 'new cold war' is exclusively as a result of the US/west refusing to accept the validity of another country interrupting their sole hegemony.

There's no reason there can't be multiple powerful entities in the world existing harmoniously. It strikes me that for all the talk of 'promoting democracy' we seem to have little faith in it and are constantly terrified that it's about to collapse.

&gt;&gt; it's going to be interesting to see who is involved and how much debt they owe to China. This is where their debt diplomacy strategies can pay off

For example I interpreted this as a criticism, but the international institutions set up by the west to favour the west have been engaged in 'debt diplomacy' for 70 years. The imf and world bank use money to enforce political and economic ideological demands on those they lend to. Hell even the EU enforces very questionable privatisation demands on new members.

Economic imperialism never died, and I'd argue that its stronger than ever, especially with the use of unilateral sanctions (including secondary sanctions which are illegal under international law) by the US at an ever increasing rate - as referenced by Xi in the op.

All I am trying to say is that spheres of influence exist and can be vital to security interests. Typically a sphere of influence will include the direct neighboring states or the range of a typical missile/offensive action.

Superpowers may create blocs that have larger influence. EU for example is in a completely different situation today from when the Iron curtain was Eastern Germany.

I would not call this imperialism, nations are defined by shared history and ethnicity, shared goals and values. Borders are mostly defined by geography and defense value. As multiple parties share the world it's probably impossible to not have overlapping claims or interests. Hence global struggle, treaties and constant revision. Interests don't stop exactly at borders, that has some impact on our discussion of self determination, international law is a good way to frame things but not a perfect match with political realities. There is some aspect of realpolitik here, one of the reasons I think it's ridiculous if the West throws the book at Russia.


The US are the only power laying claim to global reach and global authority. This is the other end of the scale and certainly imperialist. There are lots of claims, ideological, military, financial, moral, oil and energy, resources. All of this under the umbrella of freedom and democracy and of course capitalism. I don't think pointing this out is whataboutism. That's a power structure that directly affects me and not some deflection.

Putin certainly has public stated an ideology that is somewhat imperialist and targets at restoring some Russia centered bloc. He did not state that he wants to annex states into Russia though. Even the Soviet Union was a federated system. Yes, pretty much directed by central command as derived from history and leaning on former czarist structures.

What I'd advocate is delineating soft spheres of influence and stopping overreach. Hard conflicts should ideally be scaled down in favor of soft power approaches. Think UN model, treaties and trade vs carrier battlegroups.

I agree with a lot you are saying, especially on fascism. The military industrial complex exists in the EU, China, Russia and the US. It almost seems to be a function of blocs.

Crimea is unsustainable on their own and Russia would have been better off collaborating with Ukraine. Maybe Russia can develop a softer approach, they seem to be somewhat stuck in a WW2 heavy handed approach. A return to central governance is probably unwanted but you can't expect establishment Siloviki to relinquish power.

I think the West needs to realize that authoritarian structures are more natural to a lot of cultures and seem to be more stable than liberal democracy. There is some kind of superiority complex to this, a missionary vision to bring freedom and democracy to the world, this has been called cultural imperialism. I would love to see the world cut back on that.

The US led West should be more isolationist maybe. Why police the world, maybe reduce arms exports and focus on education and more peaceful endeavor.

Mr. Xi last week first proposed what he called a Global Security Initiative, speaking at the Boao Forum in China, warning against “hegemonism, power politics and bloc confrontation”.

Specifically, he said this would “oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”, appearing to refer to Western sanctions.

He said “some countries” were “eager to engage in exclusive ‘small circles’ and ‘small groups’”, terms Chinese officials have used previously to describe the Quad as well as the AUKUS (Australia-U.K.-U.S.) security pact.

Mr. Wang said China’s proposed security initiative would “oppose” what he called “the destruction of the international order under the banner of so-called ‘rules’ and the dragging of the world under the cloud of the ‘new cold war’”, and would “build an Asian security model of mutual respect, openness and integration”.

As to ""why now"", I think there are four more important factors worth considering.

**1** Oil prices. In 2014, they went from $120 to 60$ in a matter of months, greatly exacerbating the effect of the sanctions. They only went above $70 in 2018, but back then there was still hope of striking a Grand Deal with Trump and of Minsk somehow succeeding once Poroshenko was gone. In 2020, thanks to COVID, oil prices went down the drain again. But shortly before the buildup, Brent started hitting $80, and gas prices were record-high.


**2** Zelensky. There were great hopes associated with him. Ukrainians were tired of constantly being forced to rally around the flag, Poroshenko's militarist conservatism (his campaign slogan was ""Army, Language, Faith"") was getting tiresome, and for all the talk about prosperity and integration with the EU, Ukraine was even more corrupt and poor than before the revolution.

Zelensky won in a landslide, finally managing to unite most of Ukraine (a country that was always divided among the West-East axis). Zelensky was the most pro-Russian president Putin was going to get, and he, indeed, was keen on proceeding with the Minsk agreements. However, it was never meant to be, as he was roadblocked by the establishment, mostly pro-Western by this point.

Poroshenko and the rest of them were really, REALLY unwilling to see 4 million hardcore pro-Russian voters reintegrated in the country, and I'm pretty sure the US wasn't looking forward to it, either. If Zelensky got to reunite the country, he would be guaranteed a re-election, Russian threat would become obsolete, and nationalists like Poroshenko would become unelectable. Long story short, protests erupted, they were almost daily. https://www.france24.com/en/20191121-ukraine-protesters-demand-no-capitulation-to-russia https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-rally-over-fears-of-capitulation-to-russia-at-paris-summit/a-51579648

Zelensky, faced with the massive backlash, with a new Maidan in the air, had to back away and take a more nationalist stance. It was at this point that Putin realised that the Minsk Agreements were dead in the water. Zelensky was the best chance Putin was going to get, and yet Zelensky lacked the political will and clout to go through with Minsk. Zelensky's chances of re-election were dwindling (his anti-rating reached 60% in 2021), and Poroshenko had a good chance to take revenge. And on the off chance that Zelensky would win the re-election, it would simply mean several more years of strengthening the Ukrainian army and stalling the negotiations. Eventually, a militarist president would take office and start the attack.

**3** You are correct in thinking that this wasn't supposed to be a real war. It gives massive Czechoslovakia-68 vibes - a surprise and bloodless attack from all across the border, a swift takeover of the capital, an arrest of the leader. Putin was staking on people being happy to see the Russians. Medvedchuk is extremely likely to had been tasked with nurturing the fifth column, making sure the cities surrender without a fight.

However, in 2021, Zelensky started fighting back against the establishment and the oligarchs. First, he banned TV channels belonging to Medvedchuk. https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/03/ukraines-zelenskiy-bans-3-pro-russia-tv-channels-a72819
Then, he introduced a so-called ""anti-oligarchy bill"" - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57198736
Finally, he arrested Medvedchuk, charging him with treason: https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-medvedchuk-10-million-bail-treason/31253216.html
(shortly before the invasion, he also tried to charge Poroshenko with treason, but failed)

Targeting Medvedchuk was an aggressive move that was going to seriously undermine Russian influence in Ukraine in the long run. I reckon Putin was already leaning towards the invasion (since he had already started an unprecedented crackdown on dissidents), but this sealed the deal.

**4** Putin knew that his successor, no matter who he is going to be, was likely to lack his resolve. Also, the Ukrainian identity was still weak, but the more time passed by, the more real it was going to become.

""Après moi, le déluge"" is a popular phrase used to describe Russian politics, and Putin probably hates this line of thinking. Better solve the Ukrainian question now than leave this problem for his successors. Putin clearly cares about his legacy and didn't want to be remembered as The President Who Could But Didn't. Also, dealing with the difficult questions now would leave his successor some wiggle room for rapprochement with the West.

Seeing all this, Putin tried one last chance to strike a Grand Deal with NATO (he knew he was going to be rejected, but wanted to show everyone that he tried his best and the war wasn't his call).

&gt;The Finnish government, morally in the right, had been geopolitically in the wrong. [...] In 1939, the diplomatically isolated but under-armed Finns chose to fight, yet it was their neutrality, not their sovereignty, that had been at stake, a fact recognized by the hamstrung Finnish negotiator Paasikivi and Field Marshal Mannerheim... Stalin's security concerns for Leningrad, even if they evoked a history of Russian expansionism, were not a pretext.

The fishermen does have full legal rights to do fishing there by UNCLOS. What Italian marines did is illegal (obstruction of the rights of EEZ state as per UNCLOS) but the question was about jurisdiction and functional immunity.

UNCLOS is not very clear who has the jurisdiction in this case. India claimed it has jurisdiction as it was inside the India's EEZ (where the country has certain rights) and Italy claimed otherwise. But UNCLOS doesn't make it explicitly clear.

About functional immunity, there is no international law giving functional immunity. It was up to India / Italy to decide whether to grant functional immunity. India obviously denied it. Italy granted it.

Political angle of this is different. Because fishermen is from poor family and has strong unions, it was difficult of Indian govt to ignore or appear weak. There was also a general atmosphere of ""brown lives matter less"" than ""white marines"". 

Nationalism also became an issue in Italy. Italian Football Federation released official T-shirts with marine's name on it which apparently was shown to Indian marines by their defense minister via video link.

This is a far different result than the stalled India/US negotiations.

[],False,,Alacriity,,,,,,"I get that you're just dunking on the US here, but the author is essentially stating that Africa needs more than just token democracy. 

It needs strong institutions that can build trust in government actions from the populace as a whole. The wholesale robbery of the African population by African elite is well known, even my home country of Ethiopia is plagued by corruption.

I've seen how business from the very bottom to the very top gets done, importing routers and accesd points through customs without getting delayed for over a year took about 5k usd in bribes to get cleared, otherwise government officials hands were tied, as a personal anecdote from like a month ago.

The problem here is corruption is part and parcel with life now, everyone hates it but also engages in it, because theirs this prevalent fatalism about changing it. Everyone I spoke to that had the means to be economically productive, I.e. anyone who wasn't a beggar, just told me bribes are a part of life and I was being idealistic in thinking that it could change.

While my experiences pertain to Ethiopia, looking at the situation makes it clear that other countries in Africa are having the same or similar issues. Their needs to be a change from the top down, you can't get rid of corruption without getting rid of corrupt leaders.

And getting back to the West's involvement, it literally doesnt matter in what form the help comes in, as long as the institutions within the African nations which receive and distribute aid are corrupt, then the aid itself will only assist in further entrenching and enriching the corruption.

As a note, I've literally seen militia leaders and government officials driving around In UN or WFP vehicles, which you can tell by the plates. If you ask the people around there how they got it, those in the know will tell you without these sorts of bribes, food aid and medicine wont make it anywhere in the country.

This comment got away from me, but essentially what im trying to say is that solving problems like hunger or disease in Africa have a lot less to do with food and medicine then they do with the people in charge of the countries this aid is getting to. 

Western intentions can be as good as Christ but it wont matter if these autocrats continue to siphon resources and assets for themselves. Even without the West, programs like belt and road will just supplant western money with their own, and that money will fuel the corruption just like America's and the Soviets money did as well.",99f68777f2b3a797af6784f996e549b80451b9ca,True,False,,,,,0,1651190527,,0,{},i6lo4g5,False,t3_udv9c0,False,True,t1_i6l5mrc,/r/geopolitics/comments/udv9c0/rebels_without_a_cause_the_new_face_of_african/i6lo4g5/,1651190545,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651161727.0,[],text,t2_101may,False,False,
