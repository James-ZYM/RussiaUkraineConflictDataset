[https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-29](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-29)

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces likely intend to leave a minimal force in Mariupol necessary to block Ukrainian positions in Azovstal and prevent partisan actions and are deploying as much combat power as possible to support offensive operations elsewhere.  
Ukrainian forces are successfully slowing Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine, which secured only minor advances west of Severodonetsk and did not advance on the Izyum front in the last 24 hours.  
Ukrainian counterattacks in Kharkiv are unlikely to develop into a major counteroffensive in the coming days but may force Russia to redeploy forces intended for the Izyum axis to hold their defensive positions around the city.  
Ukrainian intelligence continued to warn that Russian false flag attacks in Transnistria are intended to draw Transnistria into the war in some capacity and coerce Moldova to abandon pro-European policies.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces attacking southeast from Izyum, west from Kreminna and Popasna, and north from Donetsk City will likely make steady but tactical gains against Ukrainian defenders.  
Russian forces will likely attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate but may conduct costly assaults on the remaining Ukrainian defenders to claim a propaganda victory.  
Russian forces are likely preparing to conduct renewed offensive operations to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in the coming days.  
Russia may continue false-flag attacks in and around Transnistria or move to generate a more serious crisis in Transnistria and Moldova more generally.",4bf2084e497d86ece824cab226205097f6dad79d,True,False,,,,,0,1651274938,,0,{},i6q818a,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t3_uekbni,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6q818a/,1651274956,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651246138.0

The Russians learned it the hard way in Grozny and probably again in Mariupol, which will likely be a good urban case study down the road as better info comes out. But they're not the only ones. That was a lesson throughout WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, and the US had to relearn the lesson the hard way again in Iraq, and hasn't ever really solved it. 

Preferably every platoon at least should have 1x AFV with heavy machine gun or better yet a cannon that delivers HE projectiles. But the Catch 22 with the US Army and Marine infantry community is that the best infantry don't get those assets. The best trained infantry in terms of dismounted urban ops are ""light"" infantry, as that's what they do 24/7, conduct dismounted ops. they do more urban training than mech units, they have more senior NCOs and officers coming from SOF units who specialize in CQB and urban focus (Regt, Group, CAG, Recon, MARSOC, etc). But they don't typically have much in the way of organic and adequate AFV support and there usually isn't enough to guarantee they get it attached. 

Meanwhile, Army mechanized infantry companies and Marine LAR battalions have infantry dismounts and the AFV organic to each squad, so they are the best equipped but the least capable usually because their mindset is mounted warfare, vehicle maintenance, and gunnery. They're usually so unfocused on dismounted ops that the dregs of each platoon are made into dismounts because nobody cares about them, while the better personnel are made vehicle crew because that's what matters to the officers, because doctrine and culture in those units is so focused on mechanized maneuver warfare outside urban areas.

The second battle of Fallujah is a classic example. Of the five assault battalions three were Marine infantry, with very limited AFV support, one was Army mech infantry with a Bradley per squad and attached tanks, and the other was a cavalry squadron of tanks and Bradley's whose commander tried to fight the battle without dismounting or breaking their unit up to support the dismounts, and that caused quite a bit friction with the Marine infantry battalions during and after the battle when the Army started shit talking.",b8a49908d2edc744c235f195dfffc6b4b07861b0,True,False,,,,,0,1651270113,,0,{},i6pxus6,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t1_i6pfss0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6pxus6/,1651270127,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651241313.0

[],False,,SmellTempter,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8kieh6u,False,False,"This was an interesting read, particularly in light of discussions I have had recently about the sanctions' potential effect on Russian military development and procurement.

First of all I didn't realize NK was a substantial arms exporter. It makes sense when you think about it; if doing legitimate business with them is already illegal, why not do illegal business with them? Weapons are also one of the few goods they have substantial manufacturing capacity and experience in the production thereof.

I certainly didn't realize the scale at which these smuggling operations were happening, though I don't think in Russia's case they would be terrible interested in getting crates of AK-47s and RPGs. It does seem like if INTERPOL cracked down on these diplomatic loopholes it could potentially be curtailed significantly.

The most interesting part of it however was this:

&gt; Secondly, Glocom
was assembling and selling expensive
military electronics from inexpensive com-
ponents sourced from civilian companies,
which is a significant departure from the
DPRK’s traditional role of selling domes-
tically produced derivatives of Eastern
Bloc arms and refurbishing Soviet-era
weapons systems (UNSC, 2017a, pp. 35–
37). To the extent that the DPRK is able to
replicate this model, it represents a poten-
tially significant new revenue source for
the economically besieged regime

My assumption had been that lack of access to high end electronics would be a major blow in russian arms development, but it appears that the north koreans can get them in such quantities they can manufacture their own products and sell them off.

To a certain extent its an ""easy"" project, to make military comms gear out of these parts to sell to other nations who are under sanctions, but its still an inspired idea on their part. It suggests to me that other than very specific high-end parts the russians should be able to more or less get the electronics they want in large quantities.

I still predict that the general economic depression, brain drain, and lack of industry will lead to a further slowdown of their arms development, and certainly hamper their ability to competitively equip their army, but we may see another ""siege state"" that can continue to forge ahead with further missile development.",465c64b39d4a22a17e59311db47db7ce57ce7412,True,False,,,,,0,1651269572,,0,{},i6pwoeb,False,t3_uetagt,False,True,t3_uetagt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uetagt/covert_carriers_evolving_methods_and_techniques/i6pwoeb/,1651269591,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651240772.0

1.) It's not at all clear that Russia can sustain a years-long modern war. Ukraine couldn't either if it weren't for most of the West being in its corner. Modern war is too costly for that. At best the history of long grinding wars is perhaps an indication that when Russia commits to fighting a war, it's prepared to see it through even at high cost. But I don't see how this war can go on for years unless it somehow subsides back into the low-intensity conflict that was occurring between 2014 and 2021. It's just too expensive. Long before then, it either escalates exponentially (and catastrophically), or it ends.

2.) *Third, NATO must signal a cohesive and credible nuclear deterrent to counter what will become more desperate Russian attempts to isolate Ukraine by brandishing the threat of nuclear escalation.*

Before this conflict started, we were -- unintentionally but pretty effectively -- clear that we weren't serious about defending Ukraine. If we had been, we'd have stationed troops there.

At the beginning of the conflict we were pretty clear that while we would help Ukraine defend itself, we were also not going to fight Russia ourselves, because it wasn't in our interest to do so.

If that was the calculation in February, I do not see how a different calculation would apply now, or in two months' time.

&gt; Secession of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia are
supported by the overwhelming majority (75.9%) of Russians
and a majority (55.2%) of Ukrainians. Among Crimean Tatars,
such prospect is supported by only 13.8%, against – 68.5%.

In the years between 2008-2014, Russia committed to a heavy propaganda campaign which presumably raised those numbers a little higher. 


I see whenever polls in authoritarian countries are mentioned there are always these types of critiques. For example in China or Russia we see a very high approval rating for the regime. Literally like double of what we see in the US. US will be like 40% and China/Russia can hit 80%.

People will say ""it's clearly not legitimate because people are scared of criticizing government""

And while I'm sure this does have a non-negligible effect, I think people underestimate the power of heavy handed propaganda.

&gt; I'd be very doubtful of the legitimacy of said ""referendum"".

I'm not saying the referendum is legitimate. You can't just invade other countries and have votes like this. It's not how things should work. But just saying there is reason to believe that the majority of Crimeans would actually prefer to be Russian. This should impact our decisions somewhat.

Oil and Gas is 40% of Ru govt revenues. Only 60% are other taxes.

Aside from loss to the economy, the government itself would have to massively cut back on all expenditures. Pensions, civil and military wages. 

To put that in perspective military spending estimates put it at somewhere between 20% of the govt budget (official) and 33% (unofficial, but independent estimates)..... so they'd lose revenue equal to somewhere between 200% and 120% of all military expenditures.

If we assume the 2nd is correct (33%) and they lost 40% of their revenue as the oil and gas sales go away .... they'd have to cut the entire non-military budget ... education, pensions, civil wages, whatever else they pay for by 60%.

It may not be quite as severe as this (as China and other places might buy some of their oil and gas) ....but on the other side presumably other taxes would decline hard as well, as the economy contracts.

It goes into detail to describe the operations and what the weapons are. They are anything from rifles, ballistic missiles, to entire fighter jets. The report has a lot of specifics and pictures to illustrate exactly what is going on. 

The whole operation does have the feel of illicit drug deals where the goods are not always what was promised, and they can be repainted or altered to appear newer than they actually are. 

The point about the shipping is also something that I found interesting; as long as the North Korean ships don't enter the territorial waters of another country, then they are free to travel unimpeded around the globe. And despite these lax rules, they still managed to get caught by going through the Suez and Panama canals.

Introduction:

&gt; For more than a decade the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), in defiance of UN sanctions, has found ways to systematically smuggle arms and other illicit goods in and out of the country. This Briefing Paper from the Small Arms Survey provides a detailed overview of how the DPRK evades sanctions by employing its diplomatic resources and exploiting key loopholes relating to transport, logistics, and proliferation finance.

&gt; Covert Carriers: Evolving Methods and Techniques of North Korean Sanctions Evasion emphasizes the importance for UN member states, logistics companies, and global banks to adequately screen and monitor North Korean activities and transactions. The study also highlights how new information-sharing mechanisms would strengthen the ability of states, private industry, and the UN Panel of Experts to better detect ongoing North Korean violations and dismantle existing sanctions evasion networks.

About the Small Arms Survey

The Small Arms Survey is an independent research project located at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland. It provides information on all aspects of small arms and armed violence, as a resource for governments, policy-makers, researchers, and activists, as well as research on small arms issues.

Quotes:

&gt; * This Briefing Paper reviews DPRK smuggling patterns and mechanisms involving bot sea and air transportation, including the critical — yet hitherto unreported — expansion of the country’s ballistic missile technology trading partnerships to small arms smuggling. 

&gt; * The DPRK also transports arms, ammunition, and other illicit items on board vessels under its control, typically hidden under large quantities of other commodities. 

&gt; * This concealment method generally prevents foreign coast guard or naval vessels from conducting an effective search of the vessels’ holds at sea, because only ports have the requisite heavy cranes, excavators, and storage space necessary to remove the bulk cargo and expose the hidden arms. 

&gt; * When combined with direct voyages from North Korea to the intended recipient, this tactic typically safeguards the cargo against discovery, because the vessels may only be inspected in international waters with the consent of the flag state…

&gt; * It is therefore no coincidence that the largest arms interdictions of North Korean controlled bulk carriers occurred as both vessels approached two of the world’s most famous maritime ‘choke points’ — the Suez and Panama canals — where they entered the countries territorial waters…

&gt; * What differentiates the tactics used by North Korean maritime arms—smuggling operations from all other arms-trafficking networks is their scope and scale. 

&gt; * A careful inspection of the seized RPG rounds revealed that they had been re-marked. ‘The markings indicated that they were manufactured in February 2016’, observed the investigators, ‘but the Panel’s on site analysis revealed that they were not of recent production but rather had been stockpiled for some time’

&gt; * The Panel of Experts also documented the removal of Cuban military insignia from MiG-21 aircraft found in the same shipment. 

&gt; * …few can do so at a price that is competitive with their North Korean counterparts. This combination of increasingly rare expertise and fire sale pricing partly explains how the DPRK is able to compete…

&gt; * Not all of the arms that North Korea smuggles are old Soviet systems. In recent years the DPRK has established front companies in other countries that are engaged in the manufacture of high-end military equipment. 

&gt; * ...military communications systems and related items, including clone cables, crypto-speaker microphones, GPS antennas, high frequency software-defined radios, and high frequency whip antennas.",b236b4fc09b3d8637d74dd6d7f82e99122b98d4e,True,False,,,,,0,1651260548,,0,{},i6pccx9,True,t3_uetagt,False,False,t3_uetagt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uetagt/covert_carriers_evolving_methods_and_techniques/i6pccx9/,1651260563,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651231748.0

I don't really have any strong feelings for or against Germany, but I think German smugness really is a seriously under-discussed topic.

These guys parade around as if they are model global citizens, and the Anglosphere's neoliberal/establishment-leftist blob really lap that up, partly because the American/British/French politics have shown a right-wing tilt in recent years and they are disappointed by it, and partly because these guys only have a superficial understanding of Germany and Europe, and just see ""fluffy socialism"" when they imagine Europe.

The reality, of course, is that Germany is a country like any other, albeit pretty well-run. But, even without going into WW2, Germany is also a country that essentially free-rides on the rest of Europe, economically and militarily. It is largely a myth that Germany is a net contributor to the EU; their net contribution of EUR 17 billion (2020) is a chump change for the young talent that they suck in from the rest of the Schengen area, not to mention the privilege of having an underpriced currency that powers their export machine.",eddb461f4583590e4194efd46aa878861e086d0c,True,False,,,,,0,1651259501,,0,{},i6p9wd6,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t1_i6p0hzj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6p9wd6/,1651259518,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651230701.0

[],False,,SmellTempter,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8kieh6u,False,False,"&gt; It's all about filtering and cherrypicking.

&gt; Most of the Russian public believe the Ukrainain army are a bunch of murdering bastards after several videos of executions or torture of prisoners - videos most of the Western media ignored.

You bring up a good point, that in media exceptional incidents receive coverage without giving us an understanding of how frequent a particular incident is. I will say I saw substantial coverage of the video where the russians are being shot in the leg, so I'm not sure I agree that these videos were ""ignored"". I will also agree that societies live in separate echo chambers, and that the Russian public does indeed probably think the Ukrainians are doing awful things.

However based upon the available information I don't think it is unfair to say the russians are engaging in this conduct far more frequently, at a larger scale, and with either less intervention from their commanders or tacit approval. I can't see the two sides as ""equivalent"" particularly where violence against non-combatants is concerned.

To give examples, look at the incidents involving the abduction and killing of local village leaders and their families, or the cases where family members were used as hostages to secure cooperation from local newspapers for publishing russian propaganda. These actions could not possibly be planned by individual soldiers, because it requires intelligence resources to identify these people as targets in the first place. This to me indicates that the russian military is fully aware of these actions, and is in fact, organizing them.

I would also highlight the difference between the response from the two armies when alerted to the possibility of war crimes:

I think we should try and distinguish between the DPR/LPR volunteers and conscripts.

According to info I have seen the volunteers are the ones who are well motivated, reasonably well equipped and have that 8 years combat experience. But they're only about 5k of these forces. 

Since early 2021 LPR/DPR have been conscripting. And since Feb 2022 they have been conscripting every male with a pulse in hte LPR/DPR areas, and this has expanded their force considerably.

The other 25-35k are these conscripts, that have a lot lower morale, are poorly equipped, have no combat experience....and, increasingly since the expansion of conscription 2 months ago, have no training at all.... being men LPR/DPR have dragged off the street handed a rifle, and pushed into the front with no more training than ""this is how you operate your rifle"".

Lumping them together as ""seperatist forces"" and assuming the (bigger) 2nd category are just more of the (much smaller) 1st category troops greatly overtstates their military effectiveness.

Although, I do also see this mistake being made the other way, with other posters lumping them together.... and assuming the combined lump are all as effective as the conscripts, understating the worth of the experienced volunteers.

The previously professional 5k seperatist volunteers are more or less exactly as good as the UA regular army units, and have comparable kit (minus NATO ATGMs/Drones).

The conscripts are vastly inferior to even UA TDF forces.... not being volunteers (as TDF are), having less training, worse kit, much worse morale, and (in many cases) questionable loyalty.",383d1345621b21df800f741a2deec4a5484507f7,True,False,,,,,0,1651256382,,0,{},i6p2kq0,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t1_i6oh02c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6p2kq0/,1651256395,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651227582.0

&gt;Dear Chancellor,  
  
we appreciate that until now you have considered the risks so carefully: the risk of the war spreading within Ukraine; the risk of expansion across Europe; yes, the risk of a 3rd world war. We therefore hope that you will remember your original position and will not supply any more heavy weapons to Ukraine, either directly or indirectly. On the contrary, we urge you to do everything you can to ensure that a ceasefire can be reached as soon as possible; a compromise that both sides can accept.  
  
We share the verdict on Russian aggression as a breach of the basic norm of international law. We also share the conviction that there is a fundamental political and moral duty not to back down from aggressive violence without resistance. But everything that can be derived from this has its limits in other imperatives of political ethics.  
  
We are convinced that two such dividing lines have now been reached: First, the categorical prohibition on accepting a manifest risk of this war escalating into a nuclear conflict. The delivery of large quantities of heavy weapons, however, could make Germany itself a party to the war. And a Russian counter-attack could then trigger the case for assistance under the NATO treaty and with it the immediate danger of a world war. The second line of demarcation is the level of destruction and human suffering among Ukrainian civilians. Even the legitimate resistance against an aggressor is at some point in an intolerable disproportion.  
  
We warn against a double error: Firstly, that the responsibility for the risk of an escalation to a nuclear conflict lies solely with the original aggressor and not also with those who openly provide him with a motive for possibly criminal action. And on the other hand, that the decision on the moral responsibility of the further ""costs"" in human lives among the Ukrainian civilian population falls exclusively within the competence of their government. Morally binding norms are universal in nature.  
  
The escalating armament taking place under pressure could be the beginning of a global arms race with catastrophic consequences, not least for global health and climate change. Despite all the differences, it is important to strive for worldwide peace. The European approach of shared diversity is a model for this.  
  
Dear Chancellor, we are convinced that the head of government of Germany can make a decisive contribution to a solution that will stand up to the judgment of history. Not only in view of our current (economic) power, but also in view of our historical responsibility - and in the hope of a peaceful future together.  
  
We hope and count on you!  
Sincerely

From what I observe from his twitter:

* [March 21: &gt; 300 Sorties](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1505920997127598082)

* [April 19: Increased 1.5 times over past 24 hours](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1516095248686108673) (could be anomaly, or not)

Seems that they're in the 150 - 250 range. 300 seems to be the tempo on some days in Feb/March.

Perhaps we're just debating about terminology. One could consider none of these struggles are moral, but rather strategic. However, that just shifts what some folk call morals into a set of strategies--countries don't act morally because of morals; they act morally because it's strategic to do so. Sure, I'll grant you that, but the outcome is the same so what's the point of this distinction? Also, the same argument could be applied to individuals--a person doesn't act morally because they're moral; that person acts morally because it's strategic to do so.

A group of countries, sometimes termed ""the West"", built a coalition around a shared support for human rights (e.g. meaningful democracy, freedom of information/association/religion, limits on government authority, \_somewhat\_ tempering the inequality of capitalism, at least recently...environmental stewardship, etc.). Perhaps in your view, these qualities have no moral component but are merely arbitrary ideas around which to build a coalition to compete with other coalitions. Countries cannot be considered moral so it is morally equivalent for some other coalition to be based on slavery, genocide, climate devastation, etc. However, this just shifts the moral responsibility to folks who support those national strategies. When we say Russia is acting immorally, we should instead say Russian stakeholders are acting immorally in supporting or not opposing certain actions. That's a lot of words and I'm unsure how that benefits anyone's understanding.

Or are you writing that a coalition based on slavery, genocide, climate devastation etc. should feel free to act that way if its advantageous? If so, what aside from morality, which you're attempting to argue doesn't exist, should have stopped the West from bombing China before it developed its own strategic weapons, to prevent its rise?",a5cec92f456710fc70c7e52a5749db5d3ddfaa5c,True,False,,,,,0,1651250564,,0,{},i6ooejs,False,t3_u8cu2e,False,True,t1_i6gw2n9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8cu2e/solomon_islandschina_deal_australias_leaders/i6ooejs/,1651250579,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651221764.0

I agree. From the first week as soon as the maps started coming out I was flabbergasted they advanced so broadly. If they had 2 million troops that wouldn't be an issue but with 200,000 they shouldn't even have bothered with Kyiv or Odessa other than supporting attacks to try to pull reserves away from the main effort which should have been Donbas and the Sea of Azov land bridge. Or if they really wanted a regime change they should have focused on a proper offensive to both overthrow the state and cut off Eastern Ukraine. They tried to do everything at once instead, but did it half ass. No they did it worse than half ass, because they didn't even act like it was a war when they invaded Ukraine.

A lot of people on this sub especially but on social media as a whole have been posting that Russians are incompetent blah blah, they're done, defeated, etc. They are basing that on what happened on the first month, when the Russians were following a terrible plan to the letter, while having shitty posture/readiness because they were outright told not to expect heavy fighting if at all, didn't actually even get a real chance to train up for the war using legit TTPs to counter things like ATGMs, arty, ambushes, etc. No military force would do well in that situation.

But now we're seeing a taste of what they could have been doing from the start, but it's not that scary because we know they can't sustain it because they already destroyed themselves acting stupidly. But the maps would look very different had they massed forces early on instead of dispersing them, picked one strategic objective instead of 3-4 and focused on it as the main effort, had each strategic, operational, and tactical axes of advance actually working together for that one goal, doing solid combined arms, and actually expecting to fight.

1 Musings about the prospect of chemical warfare in the Ukraine war are underpinned by myths and misunderstandings. I will, gradually, elaborate

2 One misunderstanding is about quantity of materiel needed for CW. You need many tons to do anything of tactical significance. Small quantities are kind of pointless on chemical warfare

3 Talk like “one cup of Sarin can kill 20,000 people” is pointless talk not borne out by actual field results

4 Such myths arise from taking theoretical toxicity figure and doing a lot of pointless cocktail napkin calculations that don’t account for a lot of dissemination and environmental variables

5 Another myth is that somehow CW is highly effective as a weapon. It usually isn’t. It is unpredictable and variable.

6 Many of the variables are subject to change on short notice

7 Compared to the types of conventional weapons in commonplace use, chemical weapons are far less useful

8 On any given day, chemical weapons are superior to conventional weapons in a very narrow range of conditions in the field

9 There’s a slightly wider band of conditions where they might have approximately equal tactical effect as conventional weapons, albeit incurring a political penalty, operational penalties, and expense

10 There are a lot of conditions, actually the majority of the time in most places, where they will have some effect but less than conventional weapons

11 Then there are conditions when even highly deadly CW have no effect

12 Finally, there’s 2-3% of the time wherein a chemical attack has negative tactical value by harming friendly troops and not the enemy

13 Offensive chemical warfare target analysis can help an attacker identify the times and places where CW might be usefully employed in a manner superior to conventional firepower

14 In a European theatre of operations this might be less than 5% of the time.

15 When you consider that that 5% needs to occur at a time and place when it makes sense militarily, the useful scenarios are vanishingly small

16 Another misunderstanding is that, somehow, Ukraine is an easy target.

17 In fact, the Ukrainian military started from a reasonable point of chemical defence readiness and much effort in the last month has improved that

18 There’s also a defensive effectiveness curve. CW is an area where experienced and equipped troops can almost entirely obviate the threat in a way you can’t do against bombs and bullets

19 For every time a user of CW got it “right” - Halabja, Ghouta, there were dozens if not hundreds of incidents you never heard of which were failed attacks

20 None of this is to minimize the tragedy of such incidents. Indeed, part of the major problem with CW is that it disproportionately affects civilians

21 So, the reason why chemical warfare has largely NOT been a thing is that it was largely seen by mainstream military commanders as not worth the money and effort

22 It became an early object of arms control not because it was an effective weapon, but a problematic one

23 There’s also a long-standing myth that chemical weapons are categorically cheaper than conventional weapons. This is largely untrue

8 On any given day, chemical weapons are superior to conventional weapons in a very narrow range of conditions in the field

9 There’s a slightly wider band of conditions where they might have approximately equal tactical effect as conventional weapons, albeit incurring a political penalty, operational penalties, and expense

10 There are a lot of conditions, actually the majority of the time in most places, where they will have some effect but less than conventional weapons

11 Then there are conditions when even highly deadly CW have no effect

12 Finally, there’s 2-3% of the time wherein a chemical attack has negative tactical value by harming friendly troops and not the enemy

13 Offensive chemical warfare target analysis can help an attacker identify the times and places where CW might be usefully employed in a manner superior to conventional firepower

14 In a European theatre of operations this might be less than 5% of the time.

15 When you consider that that 5% needs to occur at a time and place when it makes sense militarily, the useful scenarios are vanishingly small

16 Another misunderstanding is that, somehow, Ukraine is an easy target.

17 In fact, the Ukrainian military started from a reasonable point of chemical defence readiness and much effort in the last month has improved that

18 There’s also a defensive effectiveness curve. CW is an area where experienced and equipped troops can almost entirely obviate the threat in a way you can’t do against bombs and bullets

19 For every time a user of CW got it “right” - Halabja, Ghouta, there were dozens if not hundreds of incidents you never heard of which were failed attacks

20 None of this is to minimize the tragedy of such incidents. Indeed, part of the major problem with CW is that it disproportionately affects civilians

21 So, the reason why chemical warfare has largely NOT been a thing is that it was largely seen by mainstream military commanders as not worth the money and effort

22 It became an early object of arms control not because it was an effective weapon, but a problematic one

23 There’s also a long-standing myth that chemical weapons are categorically cheaper than conventional weapons. This is largely untrue

The issue with posting near and far side security is that it assumes the 1-2  dudes at each corner will be able to kill/suppress an enemy covering the linear danger area. Also, them performing covering fire might even tip off an enemy who might otherwise not be even actively scanning or aiming down their sights, so if they weren't paying attention before they would be after shots are fired, they'd be alert with weapon in shoulder and that's not the time you want to be in the open. 

Same goes with smoke grenade, sure they offer obscurance but they also tip off the enemy, who sees smoke billowing at an intersection and what is that telling them? Somebody is trying to move into the open without being seen. If so, aim into the smoke cloud and perform traversing grazing fire. 

But if you don't think the enemy knows you're there, and you might be able to cross a full squad using the element of surprise, put them in line formation and everyone crosses at the exact same time. If nobody engages, up to a full platoon can cross in the length of time it takes one person to run the distance. However, if the enemy is alert and already aiming it can be disastrous as they can fire down the long axis of everyone, stack up a lot of bodies doing that.

When you're fighting a war in a populated areas, and particularly with a friendly population, police have a role along with any other first responders in managing that civilian population and ensuring they're safe.

2.  The US and UK have a specific model of civilian policing that is not universal.  (Even taking into account the militarization of US police forces).  Police often work for the national government and may ultimately answer to the same folks as the military.   In many countries it's useful to think about a continuum of units.

Without knowing how exactly it would happen it is hard to know exactly when it will happen. But if it was easy to tell what would happen, it would be easier to avoid the trigger or preempt the process. 

For a coup coming from  powerful people you would need to know the detailed power dynamics and how specific people would react, but if that was known well enough to predict it, it would be easier to stop. For something originating from the public on the other hand you run into the usual trouble with predicting highly complex systems. You can guess what might cause a result but it is rather hard to be certain.

I think it's very telling that Putin launched this invasion not as a war, but as a ""special operation."" Those have very different connotations in Russia, which leads me to believe he is hesitant to actually launch full mobilization of the country against Ukraine. 

I think if Russia does launch full mobilization it will be a recognition that Putin's gamble failed, it will take away a lot of Putin's ability to determine the course of the war (he can't mobilize the country but call it quits with limited gains, he would need total victory), it would put even more strain on the Russian economy, and it could backfire and cause a lot of public unrest (mobilization may not be very popular in Russia). I think its important to note that young Russians are the most opposed to the conflict but would comprise the troops mobilized for war in the event of full mobilization. 

I think there's a good chance Putin will call for full mobilization eventually as it's the only way Russia can even potentially avoid defeat, but if he does and Russia loses the war (or only achieves minor victories) Putin is toast.",ecf3577f7cb4d1e7cedfacc2465de7339aced645,True,False,,,,,0,1651241798,,0,{},i6o2yqu,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t1_i6nrq1n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6o2yqu/,1651241811,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651212998.0

I'm sure there is some industries that could employ more shifts in an emergency, but there are limitation on machinery (maintenance ), personnel, costs, efficiency, and supplies that don't disappear  because the government wants you to work faster. 

You're still talking about this productivity improvement as if raw materials and parts sourcing isn't an issue.  It absolutely is, you can assign as many people as you want. A car plant isn't producing anything if they're missing parts.  Look at how the chip shortage has affected North American vehicle production. 

Germany absolutely expanded their arms production facilities before and during the war, I was just reading about it the other day ""Wages of Destruction"" by Adam Tooze. 

Nothing is stopping Russia from running as many shifts as they want at the Uralvagonzavod tank plant without mobilization.  Nothing.

*Ukraine is relying on its secret weapon in the war against Russia: Trains*

Rail has played a pivotal role for both sides of the war, and it may help explain the failure of Russian forces to win control of the country.

- Ukraine has one of the largest rail networks in the world, with 12,400 miles of track. Rail is one of the country’s largest employers, with more than 260,000 staff members.

- Rail has played a pivotal role for both sides of the war, and it may help explain the failure of Russian forces to win control of the country. Russia was unable to fully use the railways in the early stages of the invasion, experts say, leading to logistical problems and images of Russian trucks stuck in winter mud.

- “The railways have played a massively important role in the conflict so far, insofar as it’s the way the Russian motorized ground forces move their troops around,” said Emily Ferris, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London. “All of the problems they’ve had in the north are because they weren’t able to control the logistical hubs.”

- Russian forces had stopped short of targeting railway infrastructure in Ukraine in the hope they would take control of it themselves

- The Russian military depends heavily on rail logistics

- Seemingly unable to take control of the rail network, Russia instead now appears to be intent on trying to disable it.

- Other experts agree that the airstrikes on railway targets also underscore the slow progress of Russia’s campaign and signal that the conflict has entered a dangerous new phase. 

- The railway system Russia has relied upon may not have proven so resilient.

- But the rail link from Belarus to Ukraine was severed, the head of the Ukrainian rail network said in March, leaving Russian forces even more reliant on their limited number of trucks, which were prime targets for small-scale ambush attacks, Ferris said.",3fce02575f1c9211649a1767566da725dfa99ddf,True,False,,,,,0,1651239391,,0,{},i6nxh9i,False,t3_uekbni,False,False,t3_uekbni,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6nxh9i/,1651239403,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651210591.0

For the Russians Kharkiv is the right-most edge of their front and any hope of surrounding or taking the city was lost relatively soon in the war.

For the Ukrainians it is their second largest city that has been continuously shelled since the first day of the war. It also a strong potential forward base of operations for a potential future push eastward to cut off the Russian advance towards Izjum.

So in Ukrainian interest, it is to push Russians further away from Kharkiv to stop regular artillery shelling of the city and in order to prepare for a potential future counter-offensive in the region. Kharkiv is a well supplied base (i.e a strongpoint for Ukrainians) and the front with Russians there is not the strongest from the Russian side.

From the Russian side this area is currently of lower importance compared to the main action Donbas and is therefore something that they can slightly give back on. Only as far as such Ukrainian advance would not start to threaten Russian supplies to Izjum or threaten Belgorod itself. 

So there is a little bit of buffer for Russians to give in, due to its secondary nature at the moment. And there is potential and benefit for Ukraine to try and liberate some of their territories there.

The Ruble has recovered, but only due to ruinously high interest rates, capital controls, and the fact that Russia can hardly import anything from the West. The effects of this will only get worse for Russia. Putin had to prevent the central bank director (who is actually quite competent) from resigning.

&gt; * the next phase of the war will likely be decided in western Ukraine along the network of roads, small airports, and rail lines connecting the nation to Europe. 

&gt; * In military theory, interdiction represents actions to disrupt, delay, or destroy enemy military capabilities—to include precursors like logistics—before they can be brought to bear against friendly forces. 

&gt; * The war is becoming a race to resupply and interdict as both sides seek to gain a competitive advantage. 

&gt; * Moscow most find a way to interdict Ukrainian logistics at operational and strategic levels to sustain its current scheme of attack

&gt; * Russia doesn’t have an infinite magazine of long-range munitions.

&gt; * the use of decoys, denial, and deception, Ukraine can start to decrease Russia’s ability to target effectively, a phenomenon known as virtual attrition in military theory. Imagine empty shipping containers and dry fuel tanks being struck by Russian cruise missiles based on bad intelligence.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Semyonovich_Popov

This is a bit of detective work from the author who is trying to solve a mystery of how the first big Soviet double agent (a GRU man spying for the Americans) got found out by Soviet intelligence. What caught my attention is that the events examined are from the 1950s, and we still don't know how this lethal mistake (Popov was executed in 1960) was made.

The investigation hinges on the established evidence in the form of an archive run by an FSB-affiliated historian. Which apparently contains doctored documents to throw investigators off the scent. The key to the story here is the information the author was able to find left over in Lithuanian KGB files that were not altered by current Russian assets. There the author asserts he finds the key in tracking the person who was investigating Popov. 

So despite all the soul searching and accusations directed at the CIA men in Moscow, they did not burn their man, he was already burnt before he ever arrived home in Moscow. If you have read the wiki and can follow along with the article I am sure you will find it interesting.

I once asked a speaker incredulously whether the Russians would still try to kill intelligence traitors from the Cold War days. He was emphatic that yes they absolutely would do so if given the opportunity. This was years before Skripal and Litvinenko. 

I had a hard time understanding that these types of things are perhaps the last of the grudges to be let go, and the secrets surrounding them are the absolutely most guarded. Long after the secrets of weapon systems are forgotten and revealed, multiple human generations have passed, and empires have fallen, the need for deliberate obfuscation and maintaining false fronts regarding intelligence work is still seen as vital to national security. 

That to me is the most interesting thing about this article.

---------------------

&gt; * GRU Lt. Colonel Pyotr Popov is considered to be the CIA’s first Soviet double agent. There are numerous books that discuss his espionage activities.

&gt; * Zvezdenkov’s involvement with Popov was first mentioned by Popov himself in the so-called “cylindrical letter”.... 

&gt; * Zvezdenkov confirmed.. that he had investigated Popov while the latter was based at the GRU. He also confirmed that he was Popov’s main handler when Popov interacted with the CIA officers in Moscow. However, Zvezdenkov produced no material evidence to substantiate his claims.

&gt; * I contacted the LYA and was overjoyed but not surprised to hear that there is indeed a four-page document related to Zvezdenkov...  ...this file is also valuable to the Popov case, contesting, in one crucial aspect, the interpretation of events presented in the major published accounts of his case.

&gt; * Almost overnight, Zvezdenkov’s job changed from keeping an eye on dissidents from the Baltic diaspora to keeping an eye on potential dissidents among the Soviets themselves. It is only in this new position that somebody like Popov could come into Zvezdenkov’s field of vision.

&gt; * The only existing publicly accessible source on Zvezdenkov’s professional activities in Germany is the website of the FSB-affiliated historian Oleg Mozokhin. However, for some reason, perhaps related to the KGB/FSB disinformation regarding the Popov case, Mozokhin excluded this particular appointment from Zvezdenkov’s biography. 

&gt; * Zvezdenkov was transferred to another position within the KGB in Germany. This new position made it possible for Zvezdenkov to interact with Popov on regular basis, enabled him to keep Popov under close surveillance and also potentially interfere in Popov’s professional activities. 

&gt; * Mozokhin makes no mention whatsoever of Zvezdenkov’s running this Department. 

&gt; * At the same time, his GRU counterpart, the person handling the illegals on behalf of the GRU in Karlshorst, was none other than Lt. Colonel Popov.

&gt; * In other words, when Popov met his CIA handlers in Germany for the last time on November 24, the work of the KGB counterintelligence regarding his case was already wrapped up. He was now, beyond any reasonable doubt, a doomed man and he should have been strongly dissuaded from returning to Moscow by his handlers.

&gt; * To re-state the point, the timing of Zvezdenkov’s departure from Germany noted in the LYA document seems to indicate – and, understandably, this may come as a surprise to some - that Popov’s ties to the CIA were firmly established by the KGB counterintelligence before Popov’s return to Moscow. 

&gt; * The existing major accounts of the Popov case which trace his exposure to the bungled activities of his CIA handlers in Moscow appear conclusively invalidated by this finding.

&gt; * In other words, instead of re-connecting with Popov in Moscow, the CIA should have stayed away from him.",ba1fbee24ad8d5cfe4d432dc77b22be18a45c9e6,True,False,,,,,0,1651207754,,0,{},i6mo98b,True,t3_uedo44,False,True,t3_uedo44,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uedo44/a_new_twist_in_the_old_case_a_document_from_the/i6mo98b/,1651207769,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651178954.0

That's effectively all there is to say, really. Modern economies - including Russia's - have significant slack.

&gt;If they exist already then they're likely already operating at capacity.

That assumption is mistaken.

&gt;What is this magic switch that is going to be pulled that is going to suddenly make Russia more productive of the things they need.

Shift work + the conversion of civilian industries.

&gt;It took the USA/UK/Germany/USSR years to construct the facilities necessary to efficiently produce war materiel in WW2. Mobilization didn't help with that.

That's completely mistaken. Neither Germany nor the USSR, for instance, significantly expanded their armaments production facilities during the war. In the case of the USSR, in fact, the opposite happened: its industrial capital shrunk significantly because of *Barbarossa*.

&gt;In fact, mobilization stole some of the workforce they needed

Mobilization isn't simply conscription: it entails the mobilization of the entire society, **both** to provide manpower to the front **and to supply it**.

&gt;You don't just ""allocate people to industry"".

But you do. That is what all belligerents did during WW2. In the case of Nazi Germany, their so-called ""armaments miracle"" was literally achieved via the conscription of largely unqualified **slave labor**.

&gt;Here's what happens: Russia wants 1M more men in the army, so they need 1M more rifles. Russia has a state enterprise that produces the guns they want. That factory can only produce guns at X-rate per day. It could take years before the factory can produce 1M guns. Otherwise they need a second factory, new machines, etc.. You can't just fill it with 2X the staff and make then 2X more productive. That's the hang up.

Here's what actually happens: a factory operates at full capacity with 5,000 workers, for a standard 9am-to-5pm shift, Monday to Friday.

War is declared. 16,000 additional workers are sent to the factory: there are now two additional shifts per day, one from 1am-to-9am and another from 5pm-to-1am, and Saturday and Sunday are added to the workweek.

The original 5,000 workers are divided into ""mentoring groups"", with each group allocated a share of the 21 weekly shifts and, thus, of the 16,000 new inductees. In the short term, **productivity drops**, but as it picks up over the next few months, overall **production** of the factory is a multiple of what it was in peacetime.

&gt;The Soviet Military Experience A History of the Soviet Army, 1917-1991 is a good reference. Troops were given 2-3 months once the war was ongoing at their most desperate.

I am aware of the compressed Soviet training schedules. 2-3 months of training from basic to deployment at the front is incredibly brief.

&gt;I'm not going to belabour the point, but everyone had compressed training schedules due to the war and wartime expansion.

Not at all. British and American troops typically had years of training prior to deployment. Even in the case of the Germans, you'd have to look at the latter months of 1944 and into 1945 to find them deploying troops with as little as 2-3 months of training.

&gt;I'm sure they'd prefer not to. Mostly it is regular army, volunteers, TDF, and reserves. I don't think they've technically conscripted anyone since the war started.

The regular Ukrainian army is a primarily conscript force.

&gt;Imagine a nation of 1B farmers who only produce enough to survive. Their economy might be measured at, say, 4B in PPP. Versus a country with 10M people who produce 4B in PPP.

Contemporary Russia isn't 19th century China. It isn't as rich as the G7 countries, but it's not a developing country either.

&gt;The resource revenue inflates their economic indicators despite their dearth of productive capacity.

I've run the numbers using the IMF:

\-Russian GDP per capita, 2020: $28,170.74 current intl

\-Russian GDP per capita, 2020 (adjusted for productivity without energy sector): $24,719.00 current intl

Most of the Russian gains have been east of Izyum, reducing down a Ukrainian salient. However, the Ukrainians in the area where not encircled. Instead they have been slowly retreating south of the Donets River, a powerful natural defense it took the Russians weeks to breach near Izyum, inflicting heavy casualties on the Russians along the way.

South of Izyum itself the picture is even weaker. A direct advance on  Slovyansk was stopped cold by heavy Ukranian defenses near  Krasnopillya. Then the Russians attempted a drive on Barvinkove to flank those defenses and partially cut of supplies to Slovyansk, but that was halted near Nova Dmytrivka. So now the Russians are moving even further west to try and flank *those* defenses. That advance is stalled for the moment outside of Velyka Komyshuvakha.

On the southern side of the salient, in Rubizhne and Popasna, Russian advances can measured in terms of blocks. Little to no movement.

[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"1.  Again, what part of ""mobilization"" is necessary to achieve this.  All you're essentially saying is that ""Russia will produce more"".  I'm asking HOW.  Where are these train car manufacturers, fuel tank manufacturers, MRE facilities? Are they new facilities that are being built?  That takes time and money.  If they exist already then they're likely already operating at capacity. What is this magic switch that is going to be pulled that is going to suddenly make Russia more productive of the things they need.  Again, mobilization doesn't solve this issue. It took the USA/UK/Germany/USSR years to construct the facilities necessary to efficiently produce war materiel in WW2. Mobilization didn't help with that.  In fact, mobilization stole some of the workforce they needed and drove up costs of materiel production. 

2. You don't just ""allocate people to industry"".  This isn't 1922 in the USSR, you don't walk up to a banker hand him a hard hat and tell him he's now a miner. Here's what happens: Russia wants 1M more men in the army, so they need 1M more rifles. Russia has a state enterprise that produces the guns they want. That factory can only produce guns at X-rate per day.  It could take years before the factory can produce 1M guns.  Otherwise they need a second factory, new machines, etc.. You can't just fill it with 2X the staff and make then 2X more productive.  That's the hang up.  I'll give you a real historical example.  In WW1, Russia (and France to some extent) had a ton of conscripts but, due to setbacks at the start of the war lagged behind in production to equip them.  They had bodies, but not enough guns.  They went out and bought guns from commercial sellers like Remington.  They literally just bought guns from gun stores in America because it would have taken years to build them domestically (and they didn't have nearly the challenges of current Russia to overcome). There are so many complex items Russia needs and they need much more factory capacity to produce them quickly enough to matter.  Ukraine can just get things off the shelf from NATO friendlies and get them delivered in a week.  Russia has to build the machines to build the machines they need in a lot of cases. Here's an example from the current war: Russia builds their own armoured trucks.  The engines are built in China by a Germany company. Russia can't get those engines anymore. The will either have to find a less good domestic manufacturer that already exists or start from scratch.  They have to do this for hundreds of components and raw materials now due to sanctions just for one vehicle and there are hundreds of items they need to do this for and hundreds of potential impediments and factories and sourcing of components. Again, this is not 1914, you don't just need uniforms and a gun.  You need dozens and dozens of items just for an infantry soldier much less a mechanized Brigade. 

3. Loss rates are not necessarily indicative of poor training, but a hundred factors at play. The Soviet Military Experience A History of the Soviet Army, 1917-1991 is a good reference.  Troops were given 2-3 months once the war was ongoing at their most desperate. I'm not going to belabour the point, but everyone had compressed training schedules due to the war and wartime expansion.

4. I'm sure they'd prefer not to. Mostly it is regular army, volunteers, TDF, and reserves. I don't think they've technically conscripted anyone since the war started.  

5. Nothing is insurmountable given money and time. That said, the sanctions will make things even harder. Russia doesn't have the time and money to easily overcome all the barriers. One significant barrier and nothing else will matter.  A truck goes nowhere without an engine or tires and if Russia can't produce them or can't get the raw materials to make them due to sanctions, their army is going nowhere.  

6. Not necessarily in war, PPP can distort economies and their ability to produce arms.  Imagine a nation of 1B farmers who only produce enough to survive. Their economy might be measured at, say, 4B in PPP. Versus a country with 10M people who produce 4B in PPP.  One of those countries produces enough excess to afford aircraft carriers while the other has a larger economy but can barely afford to eat. There's some videos that explain it in depth, but generally, PPP can be misleading, especially among western economies who are highly productive or resource extraction economies like Russia who make money from Oil/Gas (which they're close to not being able to sell) and a ton of people working menial jobs who aren't very productive.  The resource revenue inflates their economic indicators despite their dearth of productive capacity. 

8. Again, you don't assign workers like a video game.  You can't just throw bodies at a problem and make more food. The world doesn't work that way. 

10. What is incorrect?  That Russia has a large population of potential corpses.  No one is denying. I'm saying that, against a modern military, 10M men is just a bunch of corpses unless they're properly equipped and trained. What are they going to use to kill the Ukrainians?  pointy sticks?

11.  Again, Russia doesn't need 10M men, they need trained, equipped, soldiers and materiel like planes, IFVs, artillery, guns, and tanks, to win their war.  You don't get that from ""mobilization"", you get that by having a functioning economy to pay for things, by finding a way around sanctions, by building factories, by finding foreign suppliers, etc.. None of what Russia is going to need in the longterm is troops, again, tehy'll have plenty of unemployed people to recruit.

I'm no expert but I think its interesting that I had 100% heard of GRU Spetznaz before this invasion, but I was not familiar with the VDV. If you'd asked me ""does russia have paratroopers"" I would have said ""probably"", but I wouldn't have been able to name the unit.

It could be that bias outlined in the article where we hear about them because they match more closely to our ideas about ""special forces""",c5fed213523cf2b7e0a8c18589d2c32994ac24d0,True,False,,,,,0,1651196153,,0,{},i6m0r4w,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t1_i6ly1jq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6m0r4w/,1651196172,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651167353.0

* European nations (beyond just Hungary) break ranks and start paying in Rubles, harming NATO unity.

* European nations simply bite the economic bullet and get cut off from Russian gas completely.

* Russia blinks with an empty threat, either by completely dropping the issue, or by issuing so many ""exemptions"" that it's effectively meaningless.

1. Train cars, fuel tanks and MREs would be produced by the mobilization of the factors of production within Russian industry. Beyond that, the Russian railway network hasn't been put under the control of the Railway Troops.
2. The changes are primarily related to the occupation of the workforce. Russia, for instance, currently employs \~16 million people in the distributive trade and financial services. With mobilization, it could, say, allocate 1 million of them as conscripts for the military, another million to industry, and, say, half-a-million more each to agriculture and transport.
3. This is incorrect. The average Soviet soldier was far less trained than his German / British / American counterpart, and for good reason: the Red Army had been effectively annihilated in 1941, forcing the Soviets thereafter to compress training schedules to maintain a force in the field, creating a negative feedback loop of poor training and, therefore, poor performance - even in 1943, the average campaign saw the Soviets suffer 4x the German combat losses.
4. Ukraine is using conscripts.
5. I've read the RUSI report. As you mention yourself, ""***The Russian Government themselves came out and admitted they needed import substitution and has asked Russian industry for input on how to replace key components domestically.***"" I don't question that bottlenecks exist currently - I question whether those bottlenecks are insurmountable, given a determined Russian effort to address them.

8. The U.S. also had the higher pre-war unemployment rate, and therefore the most catch-up potential. As for what changes Russia must implement, it mostly needs to assign workers to sectors relevant to the war effort - agriculture, industry, transport, energy, etc.
9. We are in agreement.
10. That's incorrect. The tables at the end of this reply provide examples as to why.
11. Russia won't mobilize millions of volunteers and mercs. With general mobilization, it has the potential to conscript millions of men.

Here are links to tables I've created. The first shows mobilization in the United Kingdom and Germany between mid-1939 (peace) and mid-1940 (war), in terms of employment by sector.

The second shows the same thing, but for Russia in 2020 - with estimates of the manpower they can mobilize over the next year, based on the British and German experience.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian strategic bombers likely targeted a Ukrainian field hospital in the Azovstal Steel Plant. The remaining Ukrainian defenders are likely running low on supplies.  
Russian attacks southwest of Izyum likely seek to outflank Ukrainian defenses on the direct road to Slovyansk and have made tactical gains in the last 24 hours.  
Russian forces continued tactical ground attacks and shelling along the entire line of contact in eastern Ukraine but did not secure any major advances.  
Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Head Denis Pushilin stated that the DNR will postpone local Victory Day celebrations planned for May 9 until “the complete victory and the expansion of the DNR"" to control Donetsk Oblast, though the Kremlin remains likely to attempt to claim some sort of victory on May 9.  
Russian forces conducted several locally successful attacks from Kherson toward Mykolaiv.  
Russian and proxy forces continued to mobilize in Transnistria and set conditions for a false flag attack.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces attacking southeast from Izyum, west from Kreminna and Popasna, and north from Donetsk City will likely make steady but purely tactical gains against Ukrainian defenders.  
Russian forces will likely attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate but may conduct costly assaults on the remaining Ukrainian defenders to claim a propaganda victory.  
Russian forces are likely preparing to conduct renewed offensive operations to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in the coming days.  
Russia may continue false-flag attacks in and around Transnistria or move to generate a more serious crisis in Transnistria and Moldova more generally.",ae70fe95bab2b9a6e488bdc74cf1f26eb04a1529,True,False,,,,,0,1651190402,,0,{},i6lnuxa,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t3_udtbzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6lnuxa/,1651190414,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651161602.0
