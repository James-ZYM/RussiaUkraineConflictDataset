&gt;The YPG was fighting ISIS years before any Turkish or Russian ground operation in Syria. 

If you watch carefully you might understand why ISIS did not lose any power but gained instead. It is called useful enemy. Than ISIS attacked Iraq cities and captured Mosul.  Turkey helped Iraq and Northern Kurdish Autonomy to gain control of their own territories while US heavily bombed around. Later 29 October Turkey allowed heavily armed Northern Iraq Peshmergas to pass from its soil and join the fight against ISIS. That was the first ever time ISIS lost ground and backed. YPG highly propagandayed but in reality they did nothing except posing the media. Than came Russians, they bombed the sht out of everywhere first; ISIS, opposition to Asad and from time to time YPG. This started a huge immigration wave to Turkey which later made Turkey to join the fight. Turkey invited Salih Muslim (head of the YPG) to Turkey and negotiated with them not to touch or demographically change the places and people where Turkmens lived.  Salih Muslim first told they reached to an agreement with Turkey but later news started to came as different like YPG and Assad army started to make joint operations in Northern Syria over Turkmens. This made start the ground operation Afrin which aimed to control border areas around Turkey and stop forced demographic changes made by ISIS and YPG.

[],False,,jyper,,,[],,,,text,t2_44f90,False,False,"&gt; To be honest, it does seem that Russia has won in the long term with this war at least within the context of Ukraine. 

Unless this is some 4d speculation about Russia becoming a liberal democracy after Putin's fall caused by such a massive unspinnable failure, it's hard to see how anyone can spin this as a short or long term victory. 

&gt; I mean of course, it came at a cost of prestige and widespread international disapproval + sanctions from the West. They did lose potential neutrals in the Nordics but I don’t think the Russians ever considered them to not be aligned to Western interests at all. 

Yes but the semi neutrality was what Russia wanted

&gt; However they still made Ukraine into a borderline failed state (country in ruins, significant portion of population are refugees) + acquired the foundations for a ‘forever’ war to ensure NATO cannot expand into what they consider a politically disobedient but culturally similar brother + keeping Ukraine from growing economically through the costs of a ‘forever war’ and by the lack of safety. 

They haven't because Ukraine will clearly be rebuilt after they win the war. Who is going to save Russia and their economy? Russia doesn't have resources for a forever war.  Russia has also lost whatever sympathy they might have had left in Ukraine after 2014. They've garunteed that Ukraine will be very anti Russia and it looks likely that Ukraine will have stronger military at least in terms of local conflicts then Russia

&gt;I know this is not a popular Western opinion and I know the context of the invasion was a total regime change of Ukraine (at least officially) but if we look at it from a punitive expeditionary view - they are gonna do pretty well. No Western economic support is gonna happen, when Russian missile strikes are hitting railway junctions and airfields.

The US look like fairly uninterested partners in this deal, not reluctant but also not the driving force, with concerns about nuclear non-proliferation and the Australian ability to afford the submarines. Instead it looks like it was perhaps opportunistic from Australia who were able to use the UKs desire to emphasise its global ambitions post-Brexit (and perhaps stick it to the French) in order to obtain more capable submarines and an even closer military relationship with the US.
