To conduct a similar attack against the Izyum flank means attacking into a Russian stronghold position, where there are something like 4-5x more BTGs present, way more support in the area, much more secure supply lines, massed artillery, etc. They might make a dent, they might not, but its a fundamentally different operation than what happened in Kharkiv, which was the Russians essentially abandoning that area with a limited economy of force defense and fighting retreat on a sector that had no strategic importance anymore, whose importance at this point is solely due to a GLOC that might well have been replaced entirely.",83d9468ec0893ad395e2becf61c2341bad49ee7e,True,False,,,,,0,1652745195,,0,{},i8vw309,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8vcd4d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8vw309/,1652745213,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652716395.0,

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"It's a very difficult problem.

People usually learn from failure. The reason is that when most people fail. It's just the way our brains work. 

Success has the opposite problem. After a successful mission, no matter how many mistakes happened during the success, an assumption that the mission was correct in every way. Especially by leaders who were not involved in the mission. 

If your goal is to obtain knowledge and capability, then yes, you want more failures.

That said, you don't necessarily need every leader to make every mistake possible to get knowledge. It's way way easier for one person to make a mistake and everybody learn from that mistake.

So in terms of the Navy, they are operating billions of dollars worth of equipment. And the Navy is trying to push the limits of that equipment - in order to expand capability. But they don't want to risk lives or destroy equipment because that ruins careers because it's also extremely embarrassing, politically. So they tend to not risk the equipment to push the envelope. Makes sense. 

Due to the above, Navy officers are always in a balancing act of weighing the risk and the rewards for each action they take. And that is a skill the commanders need to employ in order to be promoted.

I'm not so sure that's a bad skill for wartime. Weighing the risks and reward. Because I'm not 100% convinced risky behavior is a good wartime trait. Yes, you want to take risks. Yes, those risks can sometimes be great. But you have to always weigh the risk against a potential reward, otherwise you'll do stupid things like Market-Garden or Pearl Harbor. Both of which were risky operations that spectacularly failed. 

So what you need is knowledge and capability. That doesn't necessarily mean you need ""talented risk-takers,"" you just need people who can figure out how to make things happen, either through efficiency or leadership. Not by just grabbing people who take risks. 

TLDR: I'm not so sure getting rid of ""talented risk takers"" is such a bad idea in the navy officer ranks.",85e97850c9bd01acda5fee6ab0836dd4ded8a172,True,False,,,,,0,1652744668,,0,{},i8vv0iq,False,t3_ur6hdh,False,True,t3_ur6hdh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ur6hdh/the_navy_still_punishes_talented_risktakers_the/i8vv0iq/,1652744686,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652715868.0,

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian and Ukrainian authorities negotiated the evacuation of 264 wounded Ukrainian servicemen from the Azovstal Steel Plant on May 16.  
Ukrainian forces reached the Russian border north of Kharkiv City.  
Russian forces continued unsuccessful ground operations in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and did not make any confirmed advances on May 16.  
Russian forces continued to fortify their positions in Zaporizhia Oblast.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely complete their withdrawal from the vicinity of Kharkiv City but attempt to hold a line west of Vovchansk to defend their GLOCs from Belgorod to Izyum. It is unclear if they will succeed.

That didn’t happen,” says Yuliia. “They let the Russian army grab the cities around Mariupol.” She even suggests Volodymyr Baranyuk, commander of Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade in Mariupol, “had close contacts with Russians”. Baranyuk was initially reported to have led a daring attempt to break the siege in April, but says Yuliia, the reality was “he turned out to be a traitor and went into Russian captivity even when marines still had weapons to fight.”    
 
&gt;Nothing could be less honourable for the desperados of the Azov regiment. “They will fight, fight to the end and they will die there,” says Yuliia. There is no prospect of mercy, she says: “Every Azov soldier who surrendered during the last eight years was tortured and killed.” A month ago, she says, one soldier was taken prisoner. “The Russians made propaganda videos with him and then they tortured him and killed him and took a photo of his dead body and sent to his mother. That’s why the whole world must understand that captivity is not an option for the Azov regiment.”

It was a Frenchmen who said it but believed by many more, before and after. Nearly every POTUS since Lincoln that has been in command of a war has micromanaged it to some extent, some worse than others. And America wasn't alone. Hitler is a good point as someone who micromanaged during WW2, so did Stalin in the early years, same for Churchill in WW2, who figured himself a field marshal and was planning out individual battles down to the landing beaches, trying to do the logistical calculations himself, often giving orders totally against the advice of all his generals and admirals. If Putin does do what's being reported, he's the norm not the exception. 

The very old school German concept of independence for junior commanders and initiative based orders system was based off the theory that any senior commander, due to distance from the front lines, shitty communications, and horrible intel, was going to be out of the loop of what was happening in actual reality, and thus couldn't make good decisions even if they were geniuses, so field commanders had to be able to make them since they were positioned to know what was happening best. The commander closest to the scene knew best, so empower him. Sounds great in the 18th century but it was eroding within the German system into the early 20th century and was firmly breaking down during WW2 due to radio telegraph and actual field radios giving the ability for senior commanders (and state leaders) to better understand the ""fog of war"" and see what was actually happening during campaigns, and more importantly, to have the ability to interject in real time. 

Nowadays its even worse, there have been numerous POTUS and their staff/entourage are watching individual actions real time through drone footage (like the Bin Laden raid or the battle of Khasham in Syria), commenting, giving suggestions, etc. Beyond POTUS, there have been numerous battles fought in the 21st century where command and staff not even located in the same continent of the action took tactical command away from local field commanders while watching drone footage and using teleconfering and satellite comms (like when CENTCOM in Tampa Florida took over a battle in eastern Afghanistan, OP Anaconda). 

We're at the point now its almost possible to micromanage a battle [like the Ender's Game movie battle scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSmDEMdKauI). If a state leader has the power to do that but only occasionally interjects at a river crossing or a city to attack, they're doing pretty good.",79e51c3a83e30b378caef6649b0a3ce893c64e94,True,False,,,,,0,1652743419,,0,{},i8vsgvf,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8ve34u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8vsgvf/,1652743434,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652714619.0,

People keep talking about an off-ramp that works for Putin, but I think what you are seeing here is the west trying to give *Russia as a whole* an off-ramp in the event that there isn't one which works for both Putin and for the Ukrainians and their international partners. If the narrative becomes something like ""Putin was sick, he went a little crazy, he was micromanaging things, it's all his fault"" then it is easy for a peaceful power transition to lay the political groundwork for a lasting peace. Under sufficient pressure from the political elites in Russia, Putin could step down for ""health reasons"" and some other, equally untrustworthy plutocrat can take his place without needing face saving measures that are unacceptable to Ukraine or requiring a total collapse of Russia's government, economy, and society to get the Russians to back out of this invasion with nothing concrete to show for it. Even if it's a false narrative and Putin is healthy as the horse he used to ride around shirtless on and hasn't micromanaged a damn thing. 

That result doesn't necessarily fix Russia's problematic geopolitics or its deep-rooted problems with corruption, but it does enable some stability and continuity in Russian government while also ensuring Ukrainian territorial integrity and peace on a reasonably short timeline.

ABOUT AIR SUPREMACY  
  
Sometimes it is claimed in the Russian expert community (by fans of the Due Doctrine) that since the hypothetical hostilities in Ukraine will take place in conditions of complete air superiority of Russian aviation, the war will be extremely short-lived and will end in the shortest possible time.  
  
It is somehow forgotten that the armed formations of the Afghan opposition during the 1979-1989 conflict did not have a single plane or a single combat helicopter. And the war in this country dragged on for 10 years. The Chechen fighters did not have a single aircraft either. The fight against them lasted for several years and was very bloody and costly for the federal forces.  
  
However, the Armed Forces of Ukraine still have some sort of combat aviation. As well as air defense means.  
  
Incidentally, the Ukrainian anti-aircraft artillery forces (not the Georgian ones) considerably damaged the Russian air force during the 2008 conflict. After the first day of combat operations, the leadership of the Russian Air Force was quite shocked by the losses it had suffered. This should not be forgotten.  
  
WEEPING IN ADVANCE  
  
Now for the thesis ""Ukraine's Armed Forces are in a deplorable state."" Undoubtedly, the AFU has problems with aviation and modern means of air defense. But we must also admit the following. If before 2014 the AFU was a fragment of the Soviet army, then over the past seven years Ukraine has created a qualitatively different army, on a completely different ideological basis and largely based on NATO standards. And very modern weapons and equipment are now and continue to come to Ukraine from many countries of the North Atlantic Alliance.  
  
As for the weakest point of the AFU - the Air Force. It cannot be ruled out that the collective West can rather quickly supply Kiev with fighters, as they say, out of the armed forces' stock - simply put, used. However, this second hand fighter aircraft will be quite comparable with most of the Russian aircraft fleet in terms of their tactical and technical characteristics.  
  
Undoubtedly, today the AFU is considerably inferior to the RF Armed Forces in its combat and operational capabilities. No one doubts this, neither in the East, nor in the West.  
  
But one should not treat this army lightly. In this regard we should always remember the precept of Alexander Suvorov: ""Never despise your enemy, do not consider him sillier and weaker than you.  
  
Now, as for the statement that Western countries will not send a single soldier to die for Ukraine.  
  
It should be noted that this is likely to be the case. However, this by no means excludes in the event of a Russian invasion massive assistance to the AFU by the collective West with the most diverse samples of weapons and military equipment and voluminous supplies of all sorts of materiel. In this regard, the West has already shown an unprecedented so far consolidated position, which, it seems, was not predicted in Moscow.  
  
There is no doubt that reincarnation of Lend-Lease on the model and likeness of WWII will start in the US and NATO countries. The influx of volunteers from the West, which could be very large, can't be ruled out.  
  
PARTISANS AND UNDERGROUND  
  
Finally, about the duration of the hypothetical campaign. In the Russian expert community, several hours, sometimes even several tens of minutes are mentioned. It is somehow forgotten that we have already gone through all this. The phrase ""to take the city by a single paratrooper regiment in two hours"" has already become a classic of the genre.  
  
It is also worth recalling that the mighty Stalinist NKVD and the multi-million dollar Soviet army fought the nationalist underground in Western Ukraine for more than 10 years. And now there is a possibility that the whole of Ukraine could easily go into partisanship. Moreover, these formations could easily begin to operate on Russian territory as well.  
  
Armed struggle in large Ukrainian cities generally defies prediction. It is well known that a large city is the best battleground for the weaker and less technically advanced side of an armed conflict.  
  
Serious experts point out that in a megalopolis it is possible not only to concentrate a group of thousands or even tens of thousands of fighters, but also to shelter it from the superior firepower of the enemy. It can also supply it with materiel and make up for losses in manpower and equipment for a long time. Neither mountains, nor forests, nor jungles provide such an opportunity today.  
  
Experts are convinced that the urban environment helps defenders, slows down the movement of attackers, allows a record number of fighters per unit area, and compensates for lagging behind in strength and technology. And in Ukraine there are more than enough big cities, including those with a population of millions. So the Russian army in a hypothetical war with Ukraine could face far more than just Stalingrad and Grozny.  
  
CONCLUSIONS  
  
All in all, there will be no Ukrainian blitzkrieg. The statements of some experts such as ""The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the AFU in 30-40 minutes"", ""Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in case of a full-scale war"", ""Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes"" have no serious basis in fact.  
  
Finally, and most importantly. An armed conflict with Ukraine is currently fundamentally inconsistent with Russia's national interests. Therefore, some over-excited Russian experts should best forget about their cap-and-trade fantasies. And in order to prevent further reputational losses, never mention them again.",9debd9d78f295fe8aa57bb0b090837ceedce872d,True,False,,,,,0,1652741900,,0,{},i8vpack,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8vlq41,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8vpack/,1652741912,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652713100.0,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_(magazine)

Proceedings is a 96-page monthly magazine published by the United States Naval Institute. Launched in 1874, it is one of the oldest continuously published magazines in the United States. Proceedings covers topics concerning global security and includes articles from military professionals and civilian experts, historical essays, book reviews, full-color photography, and reader commentary. Roughly a third are written by active-duty personnel, a third by retired military, and a third by civilians. Proceedings also frequently carries feature articles by Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of the Navy, Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and top leaders of the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.

———————

&gt; * …at the core of naval aviation is a system that allows pilots and flight officers to admit their mistakes in public and learn from them. 

&gt; * Unfortunately, this good practice is an anomaly in a broader Navy culture that punishes risk-taking and does not promote the course corrections required to produce experienced, effective leaders who can win wars against great powers. 

&gt; * The Navy has been discussing the “zero defect” mentality for at least 30 years, and its persistence is a warning that the service is not prepared to embrace “urgent change at significant scale,” as the 2018 National Defense Strategy prescribes.

&gt; * Adversaries may have more ships and improving technology, but free societies such as the United States are better at cultivating innovative thinkers and warfighters—if the Navy can alter course and stop surrendering this crucial advantage.

&gt; * The mentality this creates in officers, as he puts it, is: “Do what you are told, nothing more and nothing less, and you will advance. Take no risks, make no mistakes, and you will advance.”

&gt; * Culture is easy to criticize, difficult to change, and tougher still to measure. But first the Navy needs to acknowledge the problem. Institutional inability to be honest has prevented the fact-finding and data collection critical to understanding and rectifying the Navy’s cultural issues. 

&gt; * Implement a system to allow worthy commanding officers to recover from missteps and reserve firing for serious failures of integrity or competence.

&gt; * Admiral Chester Nimitz, himself the beneficiary of institutional forgiveness, deplored the “washing of the Navy’s dirty linen in public” and counseled its strict avoidance. This is still good advice.1

&gt; * China is on track to build a navy more powerful than the U.S. Navy within the next two decades. It takes more than 25 years to produce a flag officer. The question of who will compete to run the Navy in 2040 is being decided today. Navy leaders need to start obsessing over the national security risk that, when the next conflict breaks out, the United States’ finest strategic minds will not be at sea but will have long ago departed the service to work at an investment bank or accounting firm.",242a447f5771336496c0a113e787f3100cfde5fc,True,False,,,,,0,1652736448,,0,{},i8vd3jk,True,t3_ur6hdh,False,True,t3_ur6hdh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ur6hdh/the_navy_still_punishes_talented_risktakers_the/i8vd3jk/,1652736461,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652707648.0,

So is it better not to attack? Of course not. Whether the salient can be exploited depends on the force ratio. So if your flanks are stronger than the enemy pincers, they can be safe and in fact expand out, potentially enveloping the enemy troops on the frontline. If not then the enemy reserves will squeeze with the pincers and destroy the attacking force.

So whether there are salients or pincers, doesn't determine who wins. It also depends on the amount force the attacker is bringing compared to the amount of force the defender can muster.

One example is battle of Kursk. The Germans wanted to exploit the Soviet salient, so the launched two pincer attacks from the north and south.

With Ukrainian forces wrapping up the Kharkiv offensive they are eyeing the Izium front next. The Russian offensive there has been stalled for 2-3 weeks. If Ukrainians can flank them they will either be cut off and surrounded or will have to pull back across the river and head down to Yampil/Severdonetsk to backup forces there (they may already be doing some of that).  


In my opinion, it seems most prudent for Ukraine to send extra troops to Severdonetsk area sooner rather than later, but they seem pretty insistent on taking Izium next. I guess they are pretty confident their forces in/around Severdonetsk can hold out for a few months. Taking Izium would give them a foothold in the region north of the river. If Ukraine can keep moving east from there they wont have to attempt river crossings like Russia to retake areas north of the river.   


The Russian trolls on social media seem to think now that they took Popasna and Rubizhne that Severdonetsk will be surrounded and fall any time now, but we all should know by now that is a very long stretch. It took them 1-1.5 months to actually take Rubizhne even though they claimed it was 60% controlled all the way back on April 6th. Severdonetsk is a large city with thousands of Ukrainians defending it, not to mention untold numbers more in the area around it. Russians still have to travel approx 20 contested km from Popasna just to reach another large and likely very well defended city, Lysychans'k.   


Even if Severdonetsk and Lysychans'k were surrounded today, as we saw in Mariupol and many other urban combat situations throughout the last couple centuries, it could take them many months to take those cities, if ever.

Yes, drones have advanced a lot and ISR/strike missions have been a a factor, but it hasn't gone far past the learning/introductory stages in the conflicts assessed.    

In my opinion it's early in the application of drones and in a few years we will have more capable and easily available drones on the market. I would like to think of this moment like the 1920's were to the introduction of aircraft. Sure they had done ISR and a few bombing missions in WW1 but it was early in the lifecycle of the technology, only a small number of nations were using them, and it was only a few decades later that air power was seen as a vital part of the war effort. This is how I think of small drones at the moment. 

One final thing I would like to point out is that in the paper its stated ""Specifically, drones are unlikely to shift the offense-defense balance toward the offense because they are vulnerable to electronic warfare and air defense systems"" and to a point I agree, but electronic warfare (outside electronic attack) doesn't bring down the drone, it only disrupts communication between the drone and pilot. The drone when being disrupted will simply return to the starting point using onboard INS. At such a point the defender hasn't removed the capability being applied, only delayed it. Unless the system is attacked physically by a missile or by electronic attack it can be used again. For reference think of the Russian drones that were brought down by Ukrainians intercepting the comms and deploying the parachute.

When I was working in Syria, the drones flown by ISIS were a real pain in the ass not because they were capable, but because every single one was a threat and the only way to counter them was with a high end costly missile or finding the operator and taking him out.  Disruption wasn't an ideal solution since the drone would just fly home when signal was lost and the drone would be used again.

The closest rail line running to the Russian front that doesn't run through Vochansk runs through Kupyansk instead, in the far east of Kharkiv Oblast. But the nearest Russian city on that rail line is Alexeyevka, which is much farther from the front. What's more, there is no direct rail link I can find between Belgorod and Alexeyvka after scouring some maps. The best the Russians can do with all their equipment and supplies in Belgorod would be to ship them 110km to Stary Oskil, another 100km to Alexeyevka, and then 120km more to get them to Kupyansk where they would still be 60kn away from Izium.

By contrast, the direct rail line to Izium from Belgorod is about 150km. So that's more than doubling the Russian rail supply route to Izium, plus the added hassle of needing to rebuild all the infrastructure they were using in Belgorod that they can't take with them.

[],False,,Fibian,,,[],,,,text,t2_d3aor,False,False,"Having read a good chunk of the paper, there are are two key points in the supposed revolution that the authors miss in my opinion. The first being the cost despairty between the attacker and defender in individual engagments. The second which they touch on a bit, is that the revolution is only now happening and the systems/TTPs are not ready yet. This difference in opinions can be partially explained by the fact that the authors are basing their arguments on three previous conflicts in which the systems promised by the pro-revolution crowd talk about haven't been available. In contrast, I'm thinking from a standpoint of 5-10 years from now. Let me explain these points.   

TLDR tho: If I were to combine these two arguments i'm making I think it can be summed up partially by this sentence in the paper. ""We derive two key policy recommendations from our analysis. First, available data suggests that the supposed revolutionary effects of drones are at least premature and possibly exaggerated. Policymakers should hence be cautious about calls for radical changes in force structure and defense posture.""  

I agree that much is exagerated right now, especially in the forward looking crowd, but I would also argue that the revolution is in it's early stages and that the systems envisioned by the futurists weren't available for the three conflicts assessed in the paper. In my opinion there is a difference between taking a DJI drone and using it as a makeshift ISR/bombing platform and a switchblade like system that can be purchased off the shelf from a foreign nation.  

To my first point though I believe much of the revolution comes from the concept that future drones will likely stay cheap whereas the indiviual missiles/systems required to intercept them impose a dissproportional cost burden on the defender in excess of what the defender must spend for defense. If two nations with similar defense expenditure were to conduct a war, which of the two systems would be a better invesment. The Stinger system in which an individual missle costs 38K or a switchblade 300 which costs 6K. For a similar cost you can purchase 6 switchblades or 1 stinger missile. Which would the military power rather have when they know the other side is making a similar evaluation.

Often when I hear about a wargame I imagine advanced computers with fancy interfaces, but you can see from this vide that this is not the case.

Wargames have existed since the late 18th century and were played on the tabletop.  The one's on the computer are derived from those on the tabletop.  In the 1960-70s companies started producing tabletop wargames for hobbyists. D&amp;D (RPG) was originally derived from a tabletop game.  This in turn birthed Magic Gathering and MMORPG. So the military tabletop wargame has created an industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

The typical commercial tabletop game consisted of a hexagon map, small cardboard units, a rulebook, and usually two ten-sided dice.

For this type of campaign even a commercial tabletop game, the playtime could go anywhere from 8 hours to 100+ hours, depending on abstraction and time scale. From an abstraction perspective, a wargame for Ukraine is bound to take a long time, because the main combat unit for the Russians is the BTG, so you have to have a counter for each of them. 

Since the video is about Taiwan, here are [some tabletop games about that scenario](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135796/next-war-taiwan). Here [is another](https://www.gmtgames.com/p-894-next-war-taiwan-2nd-edition.aspx)

[],False,,LordOfBirds,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fmejac0,False,False,"OK these are hard questions because they deal with stuff further in the future, so I don't think I can predict them but I can provide some thoughts.

Severodonetsk - I think it is still possible to capture it in theory. If Russia puts everything they have left into the southern pincer up from or around Popasna, it is possible for them to achieve some success there and force withdrawal from Severodonetsk. I would estimate 40% that they can do it and 60% that they can't. However, even if they are able to accomplish it, much more importantly, it is not possible for them, in the current state, to capture Slovyansk and Kramatorsk fortresses. Which means that they can not, again in the current state, capture the whole of Donetsk oblast. Meaning they can't accomplish the strategic goals of the phase 2 and it is going to end in a strategic failure.

Turkey's NATO shenanigans - I only have very passing knowledge of this stuff, I guess the question is about Turkey's issue with Finland's NATO entry due to their support of the Kurds. Again don't know much about it, sounds like Turkey is trying to get something out of it.

Mobilization - this one is very strange. From the military standpoint they should have started partial mobilization in April. There is still time to do it, but they are approaching a point when even that may be too late. As Kofman mentioned, they can't get to the point where the current force is so degraded that the mobilized troops can't effectively be integrated into the existing force structure. Also losses of the heavy equipment might make it impossible to properly equip the new troops. This heavily depends on the state of the equipment in storage which may differ from how it is on paper due to corruption and poor maintenance. Moving to war economy and building the equipment is also a problem due to the semiconductor related sanctions. So without mobilization they lose, with mobilization they might win, but the time is running out. So it is puzzling why Putin is not doing it. Maybe he realizes that politically he can't survive it, maybe he's not being told the truth, it's hard to speculate.

When is this over - I don't know. It is in the interest of Russia to drag the war out for months and maybe even years. While their economy is contracting, the Ukrainian economy is literally being destroyed and Russia can do more to destroy it even more. As the world economy deteriorates and countries feel the effects of oil, gas, wheat shortage and plus all the other reasons that may cause recession, the western aid, especially financial one that is propping up the Ukrainian economy may gradually turn into a trickle. So at some point in the future Ukraine may have difficulty sustaining the war effort. On the other hand, without mobilization, Russia will have to switch to strategic defense everywhere and try to withstand the counteroffensives that Ukraine can conduct against them. So while Russia needs to drag this out (at least into 2023) they may simply not able to (again without mobilization). And of course we can't exclude that at any point a compromise diplomatic solution/ceasefire can be agreed on once one of the sides feels they have no good military solution to the problem.

As far as borders - it is hard to imagine Russia giving up Crimea, so I don't see it being returned. Most likely it will either lose Donbass or retain a part of it, but not the whole thing. Unless of course Russia escalates which will change the whole calculus.

Anyway, those are my thoughts.",fe31b19552720f5f56e0ef26461a222fb15b6217,True,False,,,,,0,1652731600,,0,{},i8v1c4w,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8uv1hl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8v1c4w/,1652731616,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652702800.0,

I don't think drones are eliminating the need for manned aircraft or that drones have significantly changed the missions required for the modern battlefield. So at the core of how modern wars play out I would agree they're not necessarily revolutionary.

However, particularly for ground forces, I think they do make a huge impact and any modern army not considering how to integrate them or develop effective countermeasures is going to have a very bad time. The ability to loiter undetected for long periods of time has drastically improved the effectiveness of artillery fires for both sides in Ukraine, and is certainly changed the calculus for how infantry conduct operations. In that aspect they are somewhat revolutionary.

While still not necessarily cheap, I don't think the ways drones impact the attrition calculus can be understated. Particularly in peer to peer conflicts where significant losses might be expected, these add up. Especially in not losing crew for manned aircraft, who require extensive (and expensive) training to be effective. It's not WWII anymore, and aircraft losses can take a lot of time to replace. Much longer than drones. Combine that with a more extensive logistical train required to maintain most manned aircraft, in a grinding war of attrition these factors can snowball. As another commenter noted, the cost of a drone is also likely far less than the systems required to provide countermeasures or destroy one. That's a trend likely to continue in the future.

In the past decade or so drones have really come into their own as a critical part of the modern battlefield, while not inherently changing how wars themselves play out as the missions and objectives haven't changed that much (most of which still require infantry to achieve in totality). Whether their ascent to battlefield staples is revolutionary probably depends on what scales and metrics you're looking at.",63d30ccc1f1f44dc96ba383b8190845e73c51602,True,False,,,,,0,1652727797,,0,{},i8us1q6,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t3_uqvuss,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8us1q6/,1652727809,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652698997.0,

For Severdonetsk encirclement they can simply move north from Popasna and not have to cross the river until the southern bank is clear. More likely they went for the crossing to accelerate the encirclement since progressing from Popasna is very slow and attacking with two pincers would make things easier as long as the actual bridgehead could be established. 

In order to do that the Ukrainian artillery would have to be discovered and suppressed before they could do much damage, meaning almost immediately. This is something that would necessitate preparatory recon, likely with drones, and strong air support of the crossing itself, which they were unable to supply.

The numbers stack up when compared to something like the Battle of the Bulge.  200k strong forces pummeling each other extra hard for a month.  


On the US side, losses in the Bulge:

which, again, looks like its in the same rough ballpark as Bulge numbers.  The 2.5 to 3.5 ratio is also interesting in light of the less-than-stellar effort the Russians appear to be making re: medical care; WW2 numbers might make sense there...

As I said before Sweden's support for YPG/PKK is a problem for Turkey and this is known across the general population.

This is a diplomatic threat which was taken very badly inside Turkey. Now Erdogan can turn the pressure into 11 as opposition has no choice but to be against Sweden.

I'd argue whether you really a modern army if you aren't integrating systems we've been using for 40+ years?

&gt; The ability to loiter undetected for long periods of time has drastically improved the effectiveness of artillery fires for both sides in Ukraine, and is certainly changed the calculus for how infantry conduct operations. In that aspect they are somewhat revolutionary.

Everyone keeps saying undetected, and I keep asking people to explain why they think they're undetected. There's a million other issues that go into consummating a kill chain against an airborne target, and a foe that has proven inept at even maintaining comms outside of the clear and has generals going to the front lines to command isn't exactly a rousing endorsement

&gt;While still not necessarily cheap, I don't think the ways drones impact the attrition calculus can be understated. Particularly in peer to peer conflicts where significant losses might be expected, these add up. Especially in not losing crew for manned aircraft, who require extensive (and expensive) training to be effective. It's not WWII anymore, and aircraft losses can take a lot of time to replace. Much longer than drones. 

The issue is that in a conflict where we are losing pilots at such a rate, we're going to need those autonomous advanced and highly capable/expensive drones that don't exist today.

As people will tell you, what are 100 MQ-9s in a fight against a competent opponent? 100 drones with no picture of the battlespace and are going to be losses where they never get in range to do anything.

&gt;Combine that with a more extensive logistical train required to maintain most manned aircraft, in a grinding war of attrition these factors can snowball. As another commenter noted, the cost of a drone is also likely far less than the systems required to provide countermeasures or destroy one. That's a trend likely to continue in the future.

You said it's not WW2 anymore: it'd be silly to assume we're going to be fighting such a war of attrition that our production of aircraft and pilots is going to be such a factor.

The entire reason we keep training to ""day one"" ops is that we believe you will fight and decide the war with the weapons and systems you have. If one side achieves air superiority or successful area denial, the other side is not going to continually zerg those systems as it will be fruitless.",b30be507be4bd0521634bf6f8b7b02022ce306c9,True,False,,,,,0,1652725259,,0,{},i8uls92,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t1_i8uj1zb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8uls92/,1652725278,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652696459.0,

[],False,,FoxThreeForDale,,,[],,,,text,t2_isg0upma,False,False,"&gt; War ultimately comes down to bean counting though? 

It's not, and it's why we often battle with bean counters all the time who don't actually understand the qualitative aspects of warfare.

I mean, if the Navy had its way, the entire on-going issue with the wretched living conditions on the USS George Washington, doing RCOH, should never have happened if they had simply paid for some lodging facilities ashore for sailors stationed on board. But I guess a few suicides was okay given the payout cost versus those facilities... oh wait, you mean it's given sailors a disdain for the Navy and crushed morale and given the Navy a PR black eye? Can't quantify that.

&gt;I understand a lot of the points you are making and I certainly agree that autonomous air superiority fighters aren't going to replace fighter jets anytime soon, however if the monetary, and just as importantly political cost, of using air assets is reduced significantly from using UAVs then it is most certainly a transformative effect. I mean, the capacity for the US to fight shadow wars with drone strikes in all sorts of situations that would untenable monetarily and politically to use manned aircraft in has already massively changed how the US fights wars. I think these changes have been bad, but I think it is undeniable that it hasn't shifted the landscape.

We've moved entire aircraft carrier strike groups to launch sorties to strike a high value target in the age of drones. So doing these ops around the world aren't a new thing - or even a drone-only thing.

Yes, I agree that drones have given us more capability - we wouldn't be using them if they were a net loss - but as I've stated, it hasn't revolutionized or changed the fundamentals of conflict as people are making it out to be.

&gt;The drone is a different air frame because it can be made to be all sorts of shapes and sizes, including ones that would not be able to carry a human.

And those shapes and sizes still have to conform to the requirements for signature management, for instance. Just being remotely piloted does not confer any actual stealthiness as people seem to like to conflate

&gt;Drones can also potentially loiter for extremely long amounts of time. Yes you make the point that munitions limit endurance massively... but high loiter time drones are useful for intelligence gathering/recon not strike capability (which is arguably far more game changing anyways, especially if you can afford artillery but not expensive fighter aircraft).

&gt;I feel like you are getting defensive and not seeing how smaller drones fielded in an organic way for recon, artillery spotting and minor strike capability are utterly changing the battlefield. It has nothing to do with 100+ million dollar advanced UAV fighter jets and everything to do with smaller UAVs giving ground forces extremely effective ways of getting information.

Yes, and I acknowledged that's where their biggest benefit is - not as a wanderwaffe, but as a cheaper form of ISR once provided by a dude in an OV-10.",3e964739f965af0111b61f5c2e72d79d5359102e,True,False,,,,,0,1652724918,,0,{},i8ukxf5,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t1_i8uiztg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8ukxf5/,1652724933,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652696118.0,

[],False,,NutDraw,,,[],,,,text,t2_ir5jw,False,False,"I agree with most of what you're saying- I don't think drones are eliminating the need for manned aircraft or that drones have significantly changed the missions required for the modern battlefield. So at the core of how modern wars play out I would agree they're not necessarily revolutionary.

However, particularly for ground forces, I think they do make a huge impact and any modern army not considering how to integrate them or develop effective countermeasures is going to have a very bad time. The ability to loiter undetected for long periods of time has drastically improved the effectiveness of artillery fires for both sides in Ukraine, and is certainly changed the calculus for how infantry conduct operations. In that aspect they are somewhat revolutionary.

While still not necessarily cheap, I don't think the ways drones impact the attrition calculus can be understated. Particularly in peer to peer conflicts where significant losses might be expected, these add up. Especially in not losing crew for manned aircraft, who require extensive (and expensive) training to be effective. It's not WWII anymore, and aircraft losses can take a lot of time to replace. Much longer than drones. Combine that with a more extensive logistical train required to maintain most manned aircraft, in a grinding war of attrition these factors can snowball. As another commenter noted, the cost of a drone is also likely far less than the systems required to provide countermeasures or destroy one. That's a trend likely to continue in the future.

In the past decade or so drones have really come into their own as a critical part of the modern battlefield, while not inherently changing how wars themselves play out as the missions and objectives haven't changed that much (most of which still require infantry to achieve in totality). Whether their ascent to battlefield staples is revolutionary probably depends on what scales and metrics you're looking at.",a888e091607ad4fdee5c4b8aae014a5f46b094e0,True,False,,,,,0,1652724172,,0,{},i8uj1zb,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t1_i8ud0gh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8uj1zb/,1652724183,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652695372.0,
[],False,,ChimpdenEarwicker,,,[],,,,text,t2_541e3z,False,False,"\&gt; Yes, there are advantages to not being manned: there's no need for life   
support systems or aircrew fatigue considerations, so you can design   
these to have extremely long persistence.

\&gt; Again, though - maybe a game changer from the bean counter perspective, but not necessarily a change in capability/effects.

War ultimately comes down to bean counting though? I understand a lot of the points you are making and I certainly agree that autonomous air superiority fighters aren't going to replace fighter jets anytime soon, however if the monetary, and just as importantly political cost, of using air assets is reduced significantly from using UAVs then it is most certainly a transformative effect. I mean, the capacity for the US to fight shadow wars with drone strikes in all sorts of situations that would untenable monetarily and politically to use manned aircraft in has already massively changed how the US fights wars. I think these changes have been bad, but I think it is undeniable that it hasn't shifted the landscape.

\&gt; And again: people need to explain why they think a drone is somehow a   
different airframe than any other military airframe. These things are   
constrained to all the same limitations as any other aircraft in terms   
of stealth. Being a drone doesn't make you stealthy unless you design   
the drone's airframe to be stealthy. In fact, some things with a massive  
 propeller are going to be quite unstealthy

\&gt; With all that said, I'll say that small commercial drones have certainly  
 given a lot of capability to the guy on the ground, especially   
irregular forces. What was previously prohibitive - local manned   
airborne ISR - is now feasible with some guy with a DJI bought on ebay.   
Irregular forces, particularly, can now achieve some local ISR   
capabilities that were once impossible for them.

The drone is a different air frame because it can be made to be all sorts of shapes and sizes, including ones that would not be able to carry a human. Drones can also potentially loiter for extremely long amounts of time. Yes you make the point that munitions limit endurance massively... but high loiter time drones are useful for intelligence gathering/recon not strike capability (which is arguably far more game changing anyways, especially if you can afford artillery but not expensive fighter aircraft).

I feel like you are getting defensive and not seeing how smaller drones fielded in an organic way for recon, artillery spotting and minor strike capability are utterly changing the battlefield. It has nothing to do with 100+ million dollar advanced UAV fighter jets and everything to do with smaller UAVs giving ground forces extremely effective ways of getting information.",1a43aa08e568ec937eb3009da5bd3ad76f85b4d2,True,False,,,,,0,1652724148,,0,{},i8uiztg,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t1_i8ud0gh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8uiztg/,1652724159,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652695348.0,

1) uranium enrichment (take natural uranium and separate it by mass by various means into U-235-enriched and U-235-depleted fractions; the small difference in atomic weight between U-235 and U-238 makes this challenging and slow).

2) chemical separation of plutonium from used reactor fuel (where some of the U-238 captures a neutron and becomes Pu-239).

Neither of these is ""easy"" but (2) is easier than (1) if you want bomb-grade material in quantity.

Japan has operated quite a number of nuclear power reactors for quite a while which means the spent fuel rods have some amount of Pu-239 that can be harvested should it be needed.",3a64a68987d118b6876bd38ca2950ed6024a1ba1,True,False,,,,,0,1652722833,,0,{},i8ufmgn,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8ucsy5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8ufmgn/,1652722849,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652694033.0,

[],False,,FoxThreeForDale,,,[],,,,text,t2_isg0upma,False,False,"As a military aviator, there is nothing - and I mean NOTHING - more aggravating than the constant talk of the ""demise of manned aviation"" by those outside of military aviation. It's like THE theme you hear about military aviation these days, whether it is from random Congressmen to your pop-milsci consumer or airshow afiocionado.

First of all, drones (yes, there are more official terms here, but I'm going to use the colloquial one) are not a new thing. They used the [Pioneer in Desert Storm in 1991](https://www.pearlharborhistoricsites.org/blog/they-called-them-rpv) doing ISR to spot for the USS Missouri and Wisconsin's big guns.

The Pioneer itself was introduced in 1986, and itself was based on Israeli drones introduced earlier - like the Tadiran Mastiff, which first flew in 1973. That's almost as old as the F-15, which first flew in 1972.

Hence why all the talk of it being a ""Game Changer"" has largely come from those who are only paying attention now (aka those outside military circles), whereas it's been integrated into military ops for a while.

And the thing is, drones aren't doing new missions. They're doing missions that manned aircraft already do. The Pioneer, for instance, is doing what the OSU2 Kingfisher was doing during WW2. But instead of a manned seaplane with a radio and his own eyeballs, you now have a guy piloting it from the ship instead with a video feed.

The MQ-1 and MQ-9? ISR and armed reconnaissance are missions that were once done by things from the OH-58 to OV-1 - and are still being done by manned fighters. 

The RQ/MQ-4? Again, they're largely doing missions that other platforms were already doing.

So all this talk of ""game changer"" falls flat in military circles: they're not doing anything we weren't already doing.

Yes, there are advantages to not being manned: there's no need for life support systems or aircrew fatigue considerations, so you can design these to have extremely long persistence. 

In the past, of course, what you would just do is send more aircraft up to rotate in and out. Or you'd fly something with very long legs like a P-3 and have multiple aircrew swap in and out.

Again, though - maybe a game changer from the bean counter perspective, but not necessarily a change in capability/effects.

(And people always forget that high persistence can go counter to ordnance - ordnance is weight that hurts endurance, and if you expend all your limited ordnance, you're not doing much of the fighting anymore)

That brings me to my next point: everyone talks about these things being attritable. And to a point, that's true - not being manned makes it easier to stomach losing one.

On the flip side though, these things aren't as cheap as you think. 

[For instance, in FY11, for the MQ-9](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY11/AFD-100128-072.pdf?ver=2016-08-23-113615-340), costs were $24M per unit. Pretty cheap, compared to other systems.

On the other hand, [the RQ-4](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY11/AFD-100128-072.pdf?ver=2016-08-23-113615-340) was $185M for the unit weapons system cost. 

And today, in FY21, the [MQ-4](https://www.secnav.navy.mil/fmc/fmb/Documents/22pres/APN_BA1-4_Book.pdf) costs ad mind boggling $287M per unit.

Guess what? Advanced sensors and communication systems cost a lot. You bet the RQ-4 and MQ-4 aren't attritable. 

So there's a large delta there, and a big part of it is what goes into the MQ-9 (a 950 shp turboprop, limited radar, and a sensor ball) versus the RQ-4/MQ-4 (an actual turbofan engine with lots of classified systems).

It costs money to get capability.

(And if you really want to expend something, just send a freakin decoy like a [MALD](https://www.raytheonmissilesanddefense.com/what-we-do/naval-warfare/advanced-strike-weapons/mald-decoy))

So that brings me to my next point: none of these systems exhibit anywhere near the autonomy people are ascribing drones to. They are all commanded by humans watching a feed - and whether you have a joystick like in the MQ-9, or a keyboard and mouse like a RQ-4, you're still putting a human in the loop.

People keep talking about air-to-air drones and stuff, and again, this is what pisses me off to no end about the non military aviation crowd. This isn't a bunch of fighter jocks protecting their turf: this is people who have spent countless hours and sorties training to air to air warfare and tactics (which is classified, so outsiders have no idea what an engagement actually looks like) who knows the higher order of thinking required to actually get a successful BVR engagement going. 

We're only now getting drones to autonomously join up on manned aircraft, and that's a basic skill trained in flight school early on that is nothing but administrative flying that can be done on stem power for any winged fighter aviator. Executing complex tactics with ROE that isn't always binary logic is well beyond where our AI is currently capable of, hence why the DoAF and DoN are all saying the same thing: manned-unmanned teaming is the future.

---

With all that said, I'll say that small commercial drones have certainly given a lot of capability to the guy on the ground, especially irregular forces. What was previously prohibitive - local manned airborne ISR - is now feasible with some guy with a DJI bought on ebay. Irregular forces, particularly, can now achieve some local ISR capabilities that were once impossible for them. 

But that also goes to the other side too, who can also leave more ISR assets airborne. So it's a bit of a two way street here.

Jomini reports only a single mech brigade, and while he might not be accurate to conduct that attack successfully would require probably a couple divisions worth of mech brigades. 

Plus, before they can even threaten the road leading to Melitopol they would need to liberate Vasylivka before then advancing southward for nearly 50 miles. That is three or even four separate operations. The first being a rather nasty urban battle, the second being a drive south through a bunch of villages/towns, each of which will likely be the focal point of the Russian defensive strongholds (basically copying the UA defense in depth).  Then comes another major urban battle in Melitopol. And lastly they have to clear to the coast to cut the roads and take the crossing points of the Molochna river severing the Land Bridge to Crimea (which would be the ultimate strategic objective of the campaign). 

However, right now the UAF are most heavily staged near Donbas, with the bulk of their UAF maneuver brigades, especially the mech/armored/tank brigades, which would be the most important in terms of capability to conducting counterattacks. Once the current Russian counteroffensive in the Severodonetsk salient peters out, then comes choice time. 

The Ukraine General Staff either leaves them where those forces are already massed with their existing supply lines, stocked ammo supply points, etc, to counterattack locally in the Donbas. Or they have to pick all of that up, leave enough forces present to deter any future Russian attacks, and then move most of it westwards, about 300 kilometers, to conduct the Melitopol offensive. 

I'm not saying they wont do that but it seems like a lot of extra work move so much forces/supplies to advance on Melitopol, especially since they will have to move it all back eastwards at some point later on to clear out the Donbas. 

However, one possibility is they be able to secretly mass a separate force (reserves?) or thin the Donbas lines enough, while building up enough supplies around Zaporizhzhia, all without tipping off the Russians, allowing the UAF to launch a surprise attack towards Vasylivka with enough strength to reach the coast before the Russians can shift forces from other areas.

Rockets started entering warfare in WW2: Russian MRLS, German V1 and V2.  Soon after we got ballistic missiles and unguided rockets fired from other platforms such as planes and ships.

So if Russia wants to stay there for a couple of months, they will. (I predict that both political and military reasons not to stick out there will overwhelm reasons to stay there by late July).

b) Even as the realization that the Izjum bridgehead will not result in strategic success (encirclement of Donbas) in the near future, there is still some justification to remain there for a possible future attempt. Let us say that Russia will actually mobilize its population, it would then be prudent to have retained the Izjum bridgehead as a springboard for future operations. Thus there still remains a modicum of military-strategic benefits of retaining a bridgehead west of Sieviersky Donets.

c) It provides operational benefits for their last Sievierodonetsk salient encirclement/assault operations. Russia can interdict and disrupt Ukrainian logistics going into the Donbas and Sievierodonetsk salient by holding onto Izjum. Ukrainian units are still fixed around Izjum and this prevents their redeployment to Sievierodonetsk. Thus this position is operationally beneficial for Russia to retain at least as long as the Russian assault in Sivierodonetsk goes on. I.e at least until early June.

d) What dislodges Russia from Izjum is Ukrainian offensive from Kharkiv to Kupyansk. And that is going to be a slow and piecemeal operation that will take months (late July).

One year after the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in the Black Sea, poll after poll shows that the locals there — be they Ukrainians, ethnic Russians or Tatars are mostly all in agreement: life with Russia is better than life with Ukraine.

In June 2014, a Gallup poll with the Broadcasting Board of Governors asked Crimeans if the results in the March 16, 2014 referendum to secede reflected the views of the people.  A total of 82.8% of Crimeans said yes.  When broken down by ethnicity, 93.6% of ethnic Russians said they believed the vote to secede was legitimate, while 68.4% of Ukrainians felt so. Moreover, when asked if joining Russia will ultimately make life better for them and their family, 73.9% said yes while 5.5% said no.

In February 2015, a poll by German polling firm GfK revealed that attitudes have not changed. When asked “Do you endorse Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”, a total of 82% of the respondents answered “yes, definitely,” and another 11% answered “yes, for the most part.” Only 2% said they didn’t know, and another 2% said no.

Russia has to know, either directly or indirectly that using even a single nuke against a country it invaded would result in being cut off from nearly all global commerce, including its largest benefactor, China.  

China, more than any geopolitical goal, wants to avoid the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  If Ukraine is nuked in any fashion, China's neighbors start to look around, see an existential crisis, and think ""NK exists solely because of its nuclear program, we are all vulnerable until we have them.""

Japan maintains enough high grade nuclear fuel (primarily weapons grade plutonium) to make thousands of nuclear weapons.  They also have the industrial base to make a weapon, with estimates being from 30-180 days from decision to bomb and estimates of 90 days to 2 years to make a bomb that can ride a ballistic missile.

South Korea is considered to have all of the knowledge and technology necessary to have a bomb in 1-3 years.  They also have domestic versions of Tomahawk cruise missiles - potentially a ride for a miniaturized weapon.

Taiwan apparently tested potential bombs as early as the 1970s, but is believed to lack the nuclear material needed to actually build a bomb.  https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB190/03.pdf

If Japan, SK, or Taiwan were to suddenly declare itself a nuclear power, China's geopolitical ambitions become complicated quickly as they're no longer able to threaten a neighbor in the same way they could before.  More importantly, though, one neighbor building a nuke probably emboldens the others to do the same.  China could realistically find itself surrounded be neighbors with nukes as countries such as Vietnam, Singapore, etc. are probably capable of building a nuke if they put their minds to it.

This brings us back to the start - China has likely told Russia that they will economically punish Russia if they use a nuke against Ukraine, or anyone else for that matter.",72818b2dc8db9e2afebede317b066a7f836976e4,True,False,,,,,0,1652718854,,0,{},i8u5kxu,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t3_uqua8k,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8u5kxu/,1652718868,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652690054.0,

That can lead to claims that Russia's performance is not the result of perceived incompetence but is a result of Ukraine receiving enough resources to stand toe to toe to them thanks to US/NATO support.

I think this is why the West is so casual about arming Ukraine and pulling out its businesses and setting up sanctions. I think Macron, with his many visits, and others gave Putin an ultimatum, that he's part of the Western order of things, or an outsider like Iran or North Korea or China. He chose the latter. And for all the hand-wringing over Crimea, its safe to say that's a far more complex situation here as so much Russian identity is tied up in Crimea and its own people have x amount of positive sentiment about joining Russia. It was a special case and the West understood that. 

This invasion isn't a special case at all. Its an old fashioned conquering.  I also this Macron meant well, and tried to pull Putin back into the Western order, but ultimately failed. I don't blame him for trying unlike many here. I also don't think a reset to pre-invasion status quo is bad because it means many civillians and soldiers spared. Ukraine stuck in a stalemate that just eats up lives every day is not the way to go, and waiting months for this mythical counter-offensive that will magically beat Russia in every front and take Crimea is a narrative I'm skeptical of, especially considering the mostly limited second-hand older arms Ukraine is allowed to have and the many months/years it would take them to be caught up on F-16's or patriots or abrams or globalhawks or whatever systems they would need to be superior to Russia in all venues, which they are not being given right now.  On top of the West moving on to other conflicts and seeing this as old news, and the political will to sign blank checks slowly evaporating.

I also think Macron's current posturing is a big show for Putin's ultimate replacement. ""Follow the rules that keep everything going, or be badly punished. We'll tolerate your autocracy and murders if you keep it in your borders. Respect the autonomy of your neighbors and stay rich and powerful. Invade, and we'll push back."" The West is more or less refusing to negotiate with him anymore and has a policy of containment and a ""let's see"" attitude, which is probably the best way to go forward with someone like him. Putin is too brazen and Russia is paying the price for his brazenness.",68d663776b4c0cd65449ceb8a81edd7086997b68,True,False,,,,,0,1652715671,,0,{},i8txpsi,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8temmu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8txpsi/,1652715689,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652686871.0,True

&gt; For example, Mexico, Azerbaijan, Morrocco and many others all could say something like Russia: ""I am being encircled, I feel threatened."" But why would they? Feeling threatened is a choice they don't make.

Regardless of how threatened those nations might feel they don't have any opportunities to actually redress that threat. In Russia's case the ""_threat_"" is used as a justification for a military attack on Ukraine and at least theoretically Russia had the capability to conquer Ukraine and in doing so would provide themselves greater geographical security and threat from destabilisation due the the ""_nazis_"" in Ukraine. None of that actually played out in practice, of course, and I don't even believe that the stated reasons are the actual cause of the invasion of Ukraine or even true but the point is that the threat justifies the response and so if there is no response there's no point in fixating on the threat.

&gt; Theoretically NATO could already be in Ukraine. Yet, the magical signature is not there, so article 5 cannot be invoked without the necessary amount of ink. On the other hand, theoretically Russia could already say something like ""NATO sends weapons to Ukraine, they are a military party and fair game"", but they don't because there is the consensus that sending weapons is not active involvement, especially when said ink is missing. But it's just that: a consensus we somehow have come to agree upon. Like money, or paying back loans, or drinking tomato juice on airplanes.

The reason that norms are so important is because there is a very bad outcome (conventional war between nuclear powers) that both sides are interested in avoiding at all costs. In this case Ukraine was unfortunate enough to not be protected by those norms and found themselves the victims of Russian aggression. You may think it's silly that norms exist and can't just be changed arbitrarily but the fact that countries act predictably is essential in order to keep the threat of unchecked escalation low - it's not silly to base your own actions on the expected response of other players.

&gt; Makes you think what we could do in terms of achieving a carbon neutrality treaty if we managed to trick ourselves into believing that a piece of paper can make the difference over nuclear war or not.

If you want to apply this sort of analysis to other areas then the crucial element is how people internalise the meaning of any agreement. If they don't consider the issue an immediate problem, if they don't consider their actions material to solving the problem, if they don't see others as contributing fairly to the problem or if they have competing interests then the agreement is less likely to be effective. War is pretty easy to avoid because typically the only reason tension exists is when there are competing geopolitical interests or if there is the perception of escalation from the other party whereas climate change often has to wrestle with all of them. Ultimately people follow laws and norms not because they're magic but because they want to, either based on direct interest or in the abstract value of existing within a society with strong laws and norms.",5d1da606d5b018bc772ba0397cd6375c9ace8166,True,False,,,,,0,1652714044,,0,{},i8tts3s,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t1_i8temmu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8tts3s/,1652714057,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652685244.0,

France in fact didn't want NATO involved, as it hampers their ability to select targets.

It's a fair qualifier, but the point is that NATO did get involved.

isn't it even more problematic that NATO can just coopt someone else's conflict? Doesn't that kinda emphasise my point? They just inserted themselves into something for which they presumably weren't even wanted? Also i think you're seriously underplaying the US' role. They dominated the actual offensive actions in end.

&gt; but once again I will repeat: just because the US likes to engage in adventurism, does not mean the rest of the Alliance really goes through with it. Kosovo enshrined that pretty well.

But they DID go through with it. Despite it being blatantly obvious that they didn't really want to. Half the nato leaders came out and basically apologised for signing off on it during their announcements. Same thing with the ridiculous 2998 statements on ukraine/georgia. Germany and france were ardently against it, but NATO went ahead anyway.

Hence why i posed the original question. I'm curious if finland or sweden would be more forceful in their rejection of NATO efforts, or if they'll just slot in behind eastern europe and agree to it before not getting involved.

I think that Ukraine is in a tricky situation regarding Crimea, since it's legally part of the Russian Federation now (from the Russian perspective at least), so any attempt to reclaim it will be spun by Russia as an attack on Russian soil.

Ukraine will be taking initiative in a piecemeal fashion. The first order of business will be the reduction of Izjum salient and pushing towards Kupyansk.

By July Ukraine will be bringing in fresh brigades to launch the first major offensive of the war, aimed south from Zaporizhzhia with the main prong being directed towards Crimea. Accompanying offensives will be directed at Kherson oblast. Russia will retreat from the Western bank of Dnepr by late August to prevent becoming cut off and to stop the Ukrainian offensive coming from Zaporizhzhia.

By September Ukraine will have liberated most of Southern Ukraine, but Russia still maintaining a solid defensive line north of Crimea in Southern Ukraine. Azovstal garrison will be liberated, or what is left of them.

In southern Donbas, the front will run along the old LOC and in the north Russia will maintain a defensive line along the rivers.

&gt;They also discuss the intervention under the auspices of NATO before it even starts... https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_71640.htm

Obviously they're going to say that on their official website, but if you were conscious back in 2011 you'd remember how the operation developed as first a Western EU plan by the UK, France and Italy who were responded to the Gulf States' request. France in fact didn't want NATO involved, as it hampers their ability to select targets.

There were daily news briefings throughout BY NATO, not by the member countries. NATO proudly boasts of the NATO intervention and there is a NATO peacekeeping force 'defending'.... a non-NATO country to this day.

I meant where article 5 is triggered. You're right about Kosovo, but once again I will repeat: just because the US likes to engage in adventurism, does not mean the rest of the Alliance really goes through with it. Kosovo enshrined that pretty well.

That's not the point. The point is that large armies taking heavy damage in men, materiel and morale do not necessarily collapse immediately, if at all (I mean sticking to the comparisons, Germans still went on an operational counter-offensive attempt in Dec 1944 against the Western Allies, who by that time had severe supremacy in every category, including morale, and yet German military structure did not collapse).

And I am certain that Russia is not going to last 4 years.

&gt;Russia has suffered major defeats around Kyiv and Kharkiv. It achieved major victories nowhere.

I guess we are in agreement?

I'm just saying that Russia has not been losing every single engagement, in fact Russia has won very many engagements. And saying that everyone says Ukraine only wins every engagement is just not true. What many people are saying is that Ukraine has been successful in where it matters - in shaping the operational and strategic developments in their favor through their tactical actions.

*You asked about if NATO would be hurt by reduced intervention power if Swe/Fin joins

*someone told you that NATO isn't about intervention power

*You laughed that statement off.

Either tell me which of those things didn't happen or concede the point, your call.

&gt;That's a thick layer of cognitive dissonance that you (and apparently everyone else here) have to work through.

""I'm not in denial!""

&gt;Well again we're just back to subjective issues.

Less intervention is less intervention.  There's subjectivity and then there's hiding behind ""oh but I disagree oh but in my perspective it's different"" so much that you forget that facts exist.  Which is why in the end you have arrived at a worldview so far from reality that you cannot reconcile it.  So you're sitting here literally an inch away from realizing the conclusion to your question, but you've lost that capacity.  Every falsehood we tell incurs a debt to the truth.  Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

&gt;sounds like intervention to me.

""the practice or policy of a government taking action to become involved, either in the problems of another country, or in the economy of its own country""

Sounds like intervention to you?  By that logic, how are Sweden and Finland remotely anti-interventionist (something you claim)?  They do that to so many countries and places.  By percentage of gdp committed to foreign aid Sweden is **the world leader**.  The **world leader** dude.  And that's before we consider weaponry sales and donations, which they also do a lot of.

See, this is another example of when you're so used to just sticking to subjective claims you know people can't disprove that when you do make an objective claim, it's so ridiculous I can pummel you with it instantly.

Because war isn't that simple. 

First, Russia held the initiative and still does because they're the ones attacking. And as bad as their plan was they still prepared for it. So Russia has the luxury of being able to maintain the initiative, as long as they can.

Second, Russia has gone largely on the defensive nearly everywhere besides the Donbas. Those economy of force ops mean minimal forces doing the absolute least effort to hold what they took while trying to keep UA forces present so they can't shift to Donbas, where Russia has massed what's left of its forces for one last offensive, which is not going well.

Third, to show the repercussions of that, look at the Kharkiv area of operations, where Russians were doing a very limited economy of force defense that got counterattacked. Now they're nearly all driven out of Ukraine, with forces that were either supposed to be helping in Donbas or in reserve needing to be shifting to protect their supply line. Which was exactly the point as to why the Ukrainians launched that counterattack in the first place. They are stealing the initiative away from the Russians. Who after this offensive ends are going to be left with a much smaller and less capable force that will be on the defensive and forced to respond to Ukraine, forced to dance to the Ukrainian's song and not their own.

Just because a side has insufficient forces to achieve their goals (victory) does not mean the side will instantly get annihilated.

&gt;\- Ukraine has mobilised and keeps mobilising. It has received enormous amounts of Western weaponry.

Mobilization is a long term process and is simultaneously under- and overestimated by western analysts. The was is in something like the 83rd day today and mobilization in its 80th or so. Some elements of the mobilized troops has certainly reached the front as replacements for losses (individuals) and as some redeployed territorial defence units as light infantry. But the vast majority of the mobilized troops has not yet seen combat, because they are not yet combat ready - neither from training nor equipment stand-point. This inevitably takes time. If we were to take the German-Soviet war as a base line again, it was only by November that Soviet reinforcements started to make a difference and it kept making a difference until the end of the war. So the impact of mobilization was gradually felt on the battlefield after 5-48 months after starting the mobilization process. 5 months in this war will be reached in late July.

&gt;\- Ukraine has more tanks in-theatre than Russia.

I agree with you in your skepticism about this claim (I'm not sure where did it come from). Russia has immense weapon stockpiles, that would surely be enough to maintain a Russian side numerical supremacy in tanks and armoured vehicles. 

&gt;\- Russia has been defeated in every major and most minor engagements. Its army morale is rock bottom.

You are surely twisting the words a bit here. Most optimistic people will argue that Ukraine has fought a lot of successful delaying and harassing battles, in which the tactical win has mostly been awarded to Russia, despite these being responsible for operation and strategic losses. Russia won hundreds of tactical engagements in their Northern offensive (where Russian forces occupied their desired positions and Ukrainians retreated), yet no Russian troops remain in Kyiv, Chernihiv or Sumy oblasts.

&gt;\- The Russian tactics sucks. Its air force is yet to make a meaningful contribution. The generals are either dead, or quarelling, or making strategic mistakes of the first magnitude.

Yes\*. Yes, but successfully suppresses Ukrainian air activity over Russian-held areas. Yes, yes and yes\*.

\*a bit of nuance that I am not willing to delve upon.

Their logistics are clearly struggling and it is hampering their actions. Ukraine is also having severe logistical issues.

EW is largely a failure.

This is a figure that can and obviously will be debated for long after the war has ended, but it's consistent with previous western projections, so it would make sense they'd keep with their projections until something changes.

&gt;Ukraine has mobilised and keeps mobilising.

A literal fact

&gt;It has received enormous amounts of Western weaponry.

The amount of western weaponry it received is relatively public information, and ""enormous"" is a subjective estimate you can make for yourself based off of those known numbers.  I personally think the amount of small arms and launchers they were given is ""enormous"", the amount of heavy weapons and vehicles they have received is far from enormous, in fact, it's less than I'd like.

&gt;Ukraine has more thanks in-theatre than Russia.

This claim was made once, and it claimed that there are more Ukrainian tanks in Ukraine than Russian tanks - which is technically true, since Ukraine stores both its battle-ready and battle-unready tanks in Ukraine, Russia does not.  So we're adding every Ukrainian tank that hasn't been blown up + every Russian tank Ukraine captured and towed to repair + every tank that's been given to Ukraine from abroad.

As for in theater estimates, it is worth noting that Schlottman and a few other analysts estimated 2 weeks ago the Donbas front has 700-900 active Russian tanks and active 500 Ukrainian tanks.

&gt;Russia has been defeated in every major and most minor engagements.

This isn't a statement by ""western official sourcedom"".  Like with the western aid thing, it's generally known which non-ongoing battles and engagements Russia has won and lost.

&gt;Its army morale is rock bottom.

On average poor morale is the assumption, yes.  There's both soft and hard evidence of poor morale among certain units.  ""Rock bottom"" is an opinion.  It's another opinion that you're kind of appending on a large body of people, most of whom probably don't hold it.  

&gt;The Russian tactics sucks.  The logistics is pathetic, the weapons obsolete, and the EW a failure.

I'll group these together since you're doing the appending opinions thing again.  Failures in each of these categories have been documented and commented on, yes.  However, like before, you're basically just saying ""oh so you're documenting failures? That must mean you think Moscow will fall tomorrow!"".  

&gt;why is the war continuing?

War continues until both sides cannot or will not fight any more. 
Neither side has reached that point.

Firstly, it reeks of bland agreement with the general propaganda narrative that Ukraine has been so successfully pushing.  I think it is acceptable and to some degree necessary (for public support, especially in war-wary populations like the US) to frame this as a ‘good vs evil’ kind of thing, but also leaves one vulnerable to falling for the inevitable triumph of the ‘good’ side, in addition to willingly ignoring any and all potential downsides to the power vacuum we are potentially creating.  Destroying something perceived evil does not always lead to demonstrably ‘good’ results.  But people like stories.  They like a narrative.  And they love underdogs coming out on top.  Making fun of a country’s war performance is maybe what you do years after the dust has settled.  Not while conflict is still ongoing and the narrative being muddied by extensive information campaigns.

This leads to the next portion of my own issue with the blind Russia/Putin mocking — it seems to ignore the fact that the Russians are not just fighting Ukraine, but the combined efforts of US and NATO intelligence along with the virtually unlimited backing of US capital and equipment injections.  Add the Ukranian will to fight and you get a recipe for dismal results.  Mocking Russian airpower simply shows an ignorance of the strategic implications behind throwing an expensive and irreplacable asset into an uncertain environment flooded with anti-air and (probably) constant US surveillance.

Despite this, and despite their perceived incompetency, the Russians have managed their retreat/withdrawal without a complete disintegration.  I’m no military expert, but I do know that successful retreats are generally not an easy thing to accomplish.  If the Russians were really as pathetically bad as the average Redditor likes to meme on about, don’t you think we’d see them in even worse shape?

Finally, maybe you don’t see the irony in your initial sentence, but from a geopolitical perspective when is mocking a nuclear armed nation ever a responsible idea?  It’s gotten so bad (in the general public) that I regularly see people question whether Russia’s nuclear arsenal even functions.  This is the kind of ignorance I see behind the whole ‘hurdur, Russia incompetent’ meme.  It stinks of someone who spends too much time absorbing everything they see on tiktok and Twitter, less time contemplating the broader situation.

No

&gt; - Russia started the invasion with too few troops. They have lost 33% since.

Too few troops to appropriately **invade**.  That does not mean no troops at all, obviously. To defend is easier than to invade, so Russia can have numerical superiority and still not have “enough” troops.  If Russia invades with 200,000 men against 100,000 Ukrainians thats not enough force for a successful invasion, but its still quite a lot of army, right?

&gt; - Ukraine has mobilised and keeps mobilising. It has received enormous amounts of Western weaponry.

Mobilization is not instantaneous. Ukraine has indicated that mobilized troops will not be ready to participate until June at the earliest.


&gt; - Russia has been defeated in every major and most minor engagements. 

Who has ever said that? No one argues that Russia occupies Kherson and Melitopol as well as all of Mariupol except the factory complex.  Compared with their apparent objectives and assumed military superiority prior to the war, that they have done so poorly is a failure.

&gt; - The Russian tactics sucks. Its air force is yet to make a meaningful contribution. The generals are either dead, or quarelling, or making strategic mistakes of the first magnitude.
&gt; - The logistics is pathetic, the weapons obsolete, and the EW a failure.

All true.

&gt; So, all that begs one question - if Ukraine is fighting an enemy it outnumbers, outthinks on the strategic, operational and tactical level. If Ukraine's morale is immeasurably higher, if it has more tanks, if it receives the latest weaponry and all Western intelligence... why is the war continuing? Why hasn't the outnumbered ""Italy"" of this war already been routed off the battlefield?

&gt; * To penetrate and operate in highly contested air spaces, a state needs aircraft specifically designed for the mission (i.e., stealth), which in turn calls for an advanced industrial, scientific, and technological base.83 Stealth aircraft, however, are necessary but insufficient against advanced air defense systems.84 

&gt; * Second, drones did not help the weaker side, the GNA, overcome its tactical and strategic inferiority. Third, the introduction of drones did not alter the balance of forces in the battlefield.

&gt; * Finally, according to the drone revolution thesis, long-range precision drone strikes should cancel close combat, thereby making force employment less relevant. Our empirical investigation does not support this perspective.

&gt; * As we show in this section, however, the Syrian case does not lend support to the drone revolution thesis: drones did not grant an offensive advantage, they did not strengthen militarily weaker actors, and they did not cancel close combat.

&gt; * But most drones had little impact on combat outcomes. ISIS drones, for instance, were easily neutralized and, overall, they imposed relatively limited damage and losses on Russian armed forces and equipment.142 Similarly, Syrian rebel groups employed their small and rudimentary UAVs mostly for surveillance or for dropping small bombs with limited effects on the battlefeld.143

&gt; * …Iranian forces *fred* ballistic missiles…

&gt; *   If drones are so easy to use, so quick and cheap to produce and procure, and so effective, why did the actors fighting in Syria instead use economically and politically more expensive alternatives?

&gt; * Azerbaijan's extensive and successful reliance on drones led many analysts and scholars to claim that this military confrontation represented a turning point in warfare.165 

&gt; * Others speculated that the systematic use of drones led to the demise of the tank, and that drones were the decisive factor in the war.167 As in the previous cases of Libya and Syria, the empirical record does not support this interpretation. In contrast, this case further strengthens the validity of the modern system of force employment to understand success and failure of drone operations.

&gt; * Finally, we observe a clear gap in concepts of operations, proficiency, and skill between Armenian and Azeri armed forces. Azeri forces employed tactics and technologies to deceive, blind, locate, and destroy Armenian air defenses, which permitted Azeri drones to penetrate Armenian air space and act with relative impunity.174 Specifically, Azerbaijan converted multiple Soviet-era Antonov An-2 light aircraft into remotely piloted aircraft and used them as baits to detect and locate Armenian air defense systems.175 Armenian air defenses fell into the trap, and by illuminating these decoys, their acquisition radars gave up their position, thus becoming themselves targets of Azerbaijan's anti-radiation missiles and loitering munitions.176 Together with the Turkish electronic warfare system, which blinded the Armenian radar systems that were still functioning, these tactics and technologies allowed Azeri drones to penetrate Armenian air defense systems and strike targets in Nagorno-Karabakh.177

&gt; * Far from being the weapon of te weak or an equalizing force, also in the case of Nagorno-Karabakh, drones systematically favored the stronger side, that is, Azerbaijan. 

&gt; * The Battle for Shusha/Shushi City is a telling example: It was “the most important battle of the Nagorno-Karabakh war” because “once Shusha fell, Armenia surrendered and entered a lopsided agreement, ceding massive amounts of their previously held territories.”196 To carry out this attack, about 400 Azeri special operation forces marched for five days through forests and ravines, climbing rocks and cliffs, to reach the city without alerting the enemy's defenses. Once they entered the city, Azeri forces “engaged the defending Armenians at close range in heavy street fighting.”197 Because fog had descended on the city by the time the attack had started, Azeri drones could not be used to destroy or disable Armenian armored vehicles. This allowed the 2,000 Armenian troops to maximize the use of their T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, in addition to relying on heavy artillery. As a result, dismounted Azeri special forces had to rely extensively on rocket-propelled grenades, portable antitank guided missiles, multiple launch rocket systems, and artillery.198 Once again, drones did not erase distance or ground conflict.

&gt; * In this article, we have argued that the dominant narrative about an ensuing drone revolution in military affairs has neglected a key transformation in air warfare, what we call the second frepower revolution. 

&gt; * To test the modern system of force employment in air warfare, we have focused on three dependent variables: whether drones yield an offensive advantage; whether they have a leveling effect on existing power imbalances; and whether they cancel close combat. For each of these dependent variables, we have identified the observable implications of the modern system of force employment and of the drone revolution thesis. We have then tested these observable expectations by looking at three recent conflicts in which drones were employed extensively—in Libya, Syria, and the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

&gt; * The evidence we have gathered does not support the idea of an ensuing drone revolution.

&gt; * While the evidence presented in this article is not definitive, our empirical analysis shows that drones have not tilted the military balance toward the offense, they have not had an equalizing effect between strong and weak states, and they have not eliminated close combat. 

&gt; * Second, our framework highlights factors that are often neglected in the academic and public debates about drone warfare and emerging technologies but that are critical for military operations—such as military personnel proficiency, electronic warfare, and air defense systems.

&gt; * For instance, before the start of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022, some analysts concluded that Ukraine had “drawn the lesson that it must invest heavily in drone technology, both indigenous and exogenous to counter Russian superiority.”213 Our analysis suggests that drones alone are not sufficient to overcome conventional military inferiority.

It's not a criticism. It's just a statement of fact that NATO goes well beyond any sort of 'mutual defence' treaty in both scope and actions.

Well again we're just back to subjective issues. 

The last 5 US presidents have been 'anti intervention' and yet they just keep intervening... because America's foreign policy based on hegemonic control and the enforcement/ support of supreme 'moral values' makes intervention inevitable. Not to mention the gigantic military. This isn't necessarily an attack either, it's just how things go. 

&gt; Intervention by Russia, yes. We absolutely aren't intervening.

So the existence of US troops on the ground for years in a stalled conflict zone isn't intervention? You know you don't have to bomb people to intervene right?

sounds like intervention to me.

just to be clear. NATO has provided the entire military doctrine and presumably the comprehensive strategy for this exact war. They have trained the troops. They have in large part armed the troops. They have been providing ongoing theatre-wide live intelligence throughout the conflict. They have gone out of their way to cripple economically and militarily ukraine's opponent. Military hardware has been working overtime for 3 months under NATO control to directly contribute to the war effort.

One thing that I think has been overlooked by the authors is *availability*, versus a simple idea of affordability which they use to describe drones in comparison to more conventional systems. The price is not so relevant if the advanced drone technology and the training to use them effectively is not available to the force wanting to obtain them. For example Turkey has supplied Azerbaijan, Libyan forces, and Ukraine to good effect and by all accounts it is very much a seller’s market where the granting of access to the drones by Erdogan is the name of the game. So I do think that the affordability is as much an issue as it is being made out to be. 

Another factor which is not examined is the cost to your own nation to field a drone capability, versus the cost of an opponent to counter this capability. The authors are correct that the drones can be countered by existing air defense systems. However I suspect it takes an inordinate amount of manpower and cost of equipment to put up such a defense. Admittedly this is something that would be very hard for the authors to measure as precise data must be hard to come by. 

I found several very minor spelling errors in this paper, that in no way distracts from the quality of it, but I was surprised as this journal is rather famous and prestigious. Although perhaps people in Italy or at Harvard are not worried about being *fred* for spelling mistakes.

Abstract
According to the accepted wisdom in security studies, unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, have revolutionizing effects on war and world politics. Drones allegedly tilt the military balance in favor of the offense, reduce existing asymmetries in military power between major and minor actors, and eliminate close combat from modern battlefields. A new theory about the hider-finder competition between air penetration and air defense shows that drones are vulnerable to air defenses and electronic warfare systems, and that they require support from other force structure assets to be effective. This competition imposes high costs on those who fail to master the set of tactics, techniques, procedures, technologies, and capabilities necessary to limit exposure to enemy fire and to detect enemy targets. Three conflicts that featured extensive employment of drones—the Western Libya military campaign of the second Libyan civil war (2019–2020), the Syrian civil war (2011–2021), and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (2020)—probe the mechanisms of the theory. Drones do not by themselves produce the revolutionary effects that many have attributed to them.

Quotes

&gt; * Over the past two decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have progressively become a constant feature of modern conflicts and, if current trends continue, they will likely become even more important in the future.1

&gt; * Substituting troops with various types of robotic systems on the ground, in the air, and at sea raises major ethical, legal, and philosophical questions.2 

&gt; * Equally important are the implications for international security: Some scholars believe, for instance, that drone technology could unleash an “unmanned revolution in military affairs,” which would affect not only military doctrine, organization, and force structure but also regional and international stability.3 

&gt; * According to the conventional wisdom, drones are considered revolutionary because of three direct effects that they exert on military conflict and world politics.

&gt; * Some, for instance, describe drones in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war as a “magic bullet” or a “tactical game changer.”5

&gt; * Rather than representing a rupture with the past, our framework suggests that drones are part of the evolution of air warfare, whose fundamental principle remains to avoid exposure to enemy fire. 

&gt; * Specifically, drones are unlikely to shift the offense-defense balance toward the offense because they are vulnerable to electronic warfare and air defense systems. 

&gt; * Drones are also unlikely to cancel existing military asymmetries because they require support from expensive and complex military assets as well as highly trained personnel. 

&gt; * Finally, drones are unlikely to eliminate close combat and erase the importance of skills and proficiency in modern warfare because of opportunities to conceal ground capabilities.

&gt; * …available data suggests that the supposed revolutionary effects of drones are at least premature and possibly exaggerated. ",82183a74d1f393517de744c67cdf06b4c3242905,True,False,,,,,0,1652707360,,0,{},i8terzg,True,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t3_uqvuss,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i8terzg/,1652707373,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652678560.0,
[],False,,svenne,,,[],,,,text,t2_61zsm,False,False,"We can't know for sure what is happening on the battlefield. But we do know that Russia still has a lot of artillery and a large amount of mechanized units/tanks left, even though it lost a lot. Now they are focusing these units around Izyum and Severodonetsk it looks like. And possibly Kherson. 

What is likely happening is Russia is gaining ground but losing a large amount of units doing so because they don't have overwhelming firepower in fights. They are therefore still suffering from huge attrition. If Ukraine would go on a wide offensive Ukraine would start losing a lot more units instead. It's better for Ukraine to hold dug in positions where they know the area and have gathered ammo dumps and can set up ambush spots they have already done recon for. Meanwhile in a focused area they will do an offensive. Just like they did in the Kharkiv region, where they seem to have gathered firepower partially with the new US artillery. 

I think the recipe for success for Ukraine is: Hold all fronts defensively, making any Ru attack painful for Russia. While focusing firepower with newest technology on one front where they go on the offensive. 

Ukraine knows Russia has to attack, because that is the only way Russia can finish this war and Russia does not want a long term war. And because it is beneficial to defend dug in positions Ukraine has for now no reason to attack on all fronts. Also Ukraine does have problems with logistics it needs to figure out. Pushing further would even increase these difficulties. Time is also on Ukraines side because they are still getting new high-technology weapons delivered to them and conducting training of these in other NATO countries. 

Lastly I want to share this tweet which shows the picture of how Russian expectations has decreased every month as they have battered themselves against Ukraine.

There is a lof of mutual magical thinking involved in the whole deterrence thing. For example, Mexico, Azerbaijan, Morrocco and many others all could say something like Russia: ""I am being encircled, I feel threatened."" But why would they? Feeling threatened is a choice they don't make. 

  
Theoretically NATO could already be in Ukraine. Yet, the magical signature is not there, so article 5 cannot be invoked without the necessary amount of ink. On the other hand, theoretically Russia could already say something like ""NATO sends weapons to Ukraine, they are a military party and fair game"", but they don't because there is the consensus that sending weapons is not active involvement, especially when said ink is missing.

It's all a lot of smoke and mirrors.

Find me a list of all the conflicts NATO has been involved in.

Then find me a list of all the times a NATO country has been attacked, thus initiating article 5.

The only one that's even arguable is afghanistan, and that was a non-state actor making it somewhat questionable whether a full scale invasion of a country was required to deal with a few hundred al qaeda members.

&gt; The only NATO engagement so far has been Afghanistan

Jesus christ the state of this being upvoted.

Kosovo was initiated by consensus by the entire NATO alliance. As far as i can tell every single member took part in bombing another country (including germany for the first time since WW2). There were daily news briefings throughout BY NATO, not by the member countries. NATO proudly boasts of the NATO intervention and there is a NATO peacekeeping force 'defending'.... a non-NATO country to this day.

&gt; , and even then some members had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the conflict or outright phoned it in and simply bribed the local Taliban during their deployments.

Sure. Because the 'consensus *wink wink*' concept in practice doesn't really work. By all accounts most countries didn't want to go into kosovo either, but i guess it's hard to say no to the country that dominates the alliance. Either way this is a different topic altogether.

&gt; There are conflicts, like Libya, where NATO members put their operations under the NATO umbrella at the request of Turkey who wanted more oversight on who France, UK, US and Italy were bombing.

What kind of cope is this? 'It wasn't NATO, it was just overseen by NATO'.

FWIW, NATO themselves disagree with you.

&gt;&gt; Following the Qadhafi regime’s targeting of civilians in February 2011, ***NATO answered the United Nations’ (UN) call*** to the international community to protect the Libyan people.

They also discuss the intervention under the auspices of NATO before it even starts... https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_71640.htm

The libyan intervention is of course in theory endorsed by the UNSC so it's hard to be too critical, but it's still not a 'defensive' conflict. It is the imposition of international political will on a sovereign state. I guess you could say we were defending islamist rebels... thus endorsing those long held NATO principles

The problem with trying to weight these actions by: either poor political decision or poor military decision is that it can be both and neither.

The problem is that the situation itself is already so poor for Russia, both politically and military-wise, that there are no ""good"" decisions. Only bad and worse ones.

Russia fundamentally lacks the military force to gain a victory over Ukraine. And that too is both a political and military failure. Russia should have never invaded Ukraine.

IMHO, there is no pure anything and part of the judgement of about a system is how it responds and deals with negative externalities.

&gt; Yes we can definitely discuss them but don't think that the people responsible for them haven't thought them through/assessed the consequences.

This is a horribly naive take imo. Right now they could sanction absolutely anyone for any reason and everyone would be cheering it on.

Also the US (not others so much) has a long history of unilaterally sanctioning people for any number of ridiculous reasons. See: Trump sanctioning the ICC and their families.

&gt; May I ask why you think it would be one of the more useless sanctions?

The only thing it really does is remove a potential lever putin has to use over europe. For the US it has the... horrifying effect of allowing them to export more gas.

&gt; It is a fact that the west is paying Russia a lot of money for fossil fuels. This money helps fund the war effort. Cutting off that revenue stream will make it harder to pursue the war. Seems to be quite sound to me.

The base logic you are using is 'we need to stop russia having any money', and again it's a nice idea, but... consequences.

If we were to just cut off russian energy to europe tomorrow, it's no understatement to say that it could lead to *global* economic and humanitarian catastrophe. The current inflationary spiral is no joke.

Anyone who plays those kind of games is dangerously reckless.

&gt; In a special collaboration with NBC’s Meet the Press, The Gaming Lab at CNAS executed a strategic-operational game to provide critical insight into how a potential war with China over Taiwan could unfold, and how the United States and its allies and partners could defeat an attack on Taiwan by China. This special edition of Meet the Press Reports shows how wargames can help policymakers better understand the dilemmas and impacts such a conflict could have on the Indo-Pacific. Watch the episode from NBC to see a CNAS wargame in action and put yourself in the shoes of a high-ranking defense official executing a military strategy.


This is a surface level look at a war game put on by the Center for New American Security. It is only 27 minutes long and does get into the finer details. But I thought it was interesting to see the interactions of the participants and just how much this looks like something that could be played at home on the kitchen table. Often when I hear about a wargame I imagine advanced computers with fancy interfaces, but you can see from this vide that this is not the case.

One problem is that the Finns have previous few artillery pieces.

Per the latest IISS report, they have a grand total of:

\-49x 122mm SP pieces  
\-234x 122mm towed pieces  
\-54x 155mm towed pieces  
\-56x MRLs

Compare to Ukraine, which started the war with:

\-40x 120mm SP pieces (gun-mortars)  
\-292x 122mm SP pieces  
\-320x 152mm SP pieces  
\-13x 203mm SP pieces  
\-2x 120mm towed pieces (gun-mortars / not a typo)  
\-129x 122mm towed pieces  
\-440x 152mm towed pieces  
\-360x MRLs

That's a total of 1,596 pieces for the Ukrainians, against a mere 393 for the Finns. Most of the Finnish pieces, moreover, are comparatively light - and towed - 122mm Soviet models.

All in all, Finland can mobilize a lot of personnel (271,950 at full mobilization, including 14,700 border guards), but it suffers from a shortage of heavy equipment.

Today Russia is in no position to invade Finland, but prior to the Ukraine campaign I'm not sure Finland's chances would have been even close to comparable to Ukraine's.",0c3713b0c3e29dbd45794b00faef098f69bdd255,True,False,,,,,0,1652677242,,0,{},i8s9yoc,False,t3_uq4l37,False,False,t1_i8rtda0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8s9yoc/,1652677253,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652648442.0,

So for example a couple of the self propelled artillery pieces that were recently announced as candidates to send to Ukraine were the CAESAR from France and the PzH 2000.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerhaubitze_2000

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAESAR_self-propelled_howitzer

So the PzH has some useful stats on the page, it fires 10 rounds a minute, range 47 km, 67 with a rocket assist. It's not clear what it's accuracy is, but the CAESAR is accurate to within 5 meters so I'm guessing it's similar.

This looks like a Soviet counterpart.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S19_Msta

It has a range of 25-29 km, and also fires 10 rounds a minute. So that's a substantial range advantage for the PzH. I don't so anything about accuracy, but people seem to be hitting stuff in Ukraine so I'm guessing it's also reasonably accurate.

So the PzH seems similar except the range is way better. What does the range look like on other artillery?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-90 25km.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M109_howitzer 13-30-40 km.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHS_Krab 30-40 km

https://www.army-technology.com/projects/caesar/ 35-40 km.

So on average, seems the western artillery outranges the MSTA by 5-10 km. Then the PzH is outclassing everyone else at 67 km, 27 km beyond the competition. That seems like the kind of difference that's a game changer, the 5-10 I'm less confident in.

How's Finnish artillery compare? Well, most of their self-propelled artillery is Soviet. But they're in the process of upgrading them with South Korean artillery that boosts the range to 40-54 km.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Finnish_Army

This seems representative of Finnish equipment to me. They have a lot of excellent new gear. They also have a lot of old gear, much of it Soviet, that isn't ideal, but used properly I'm betting it gets the job done.

Because nobody is allowing militaries to take over one of their own cities to trash it doing a month plus long exercise. That's not how training works. When they do stuff in actual cities it is super specific, nearly always very small scale, nothing kinetic, either to experience something that can't otherwise replicate. Or it's a dog and pony PR stunt. 

When it comes to training on urban combat ops, it's almost useless to do anything above the brigade level because nothing else is gained including more units. In terms of combat units, their jobs don't change nor is doctrine different because there are 300 city blocks instead of 30. At the brigade level they get to practice combined arms doing maneuver, that's all they need. In fact, most combat arms don't need to do anything beyond the company level, anything bigger is dog and pony show that only benefits higher headquarters command and staff, who can train and learn with exercises without troops (which is why the US avoids doing large scale exercises as much as possible).  When there are instances where they need to do something big to experience it so they can learn real lessons, that's when they conduct large exercises but they're still limited. 

When the US started getting into megacity planning a few years back the emphasis wasn't on training in megacities, it was on finding out what the differences between conducting ops in megacities vs everything else to learn about challenges beyond combat, such as manpower, logistics, humanitarian issues, etc. 

For instance, subterranean ops became an issue because megacities have subways but so few conventional units were getting training on it. That opened up the need to train on subterranean ops, but one doesn't need to be in a megacity to do that. 

Similarly, the brass started thinking about clearing skyscrapers because someone realized that an entire battalion or more could end up being committed to securing a single building, and potentially destroyed in the process. That meant needing to create new force ratio formulas in relation to units vs buildings, but they don't need to actually have battalions clear skyscrapers to do that, they just need to note it. 

Non combat issues involved problems like dealing with the humanitarian disasters due to supply chain breakdowns that the US military becomes responsible for dealing with (food, water, sanitation, health, power for cities with 10 million population), which doesn't mean they need to actually do humanitarian ops in megacities to know how many support units they'd need, etc.

Same goes with logistics. If we know what we need for a normal city, megacities mean more, and it's just a matter of trying to know how much.

None of these are issues the PLA have solved by building a few small urban mockups in the desert resembling a few Taiwanese govt buildings that almost none of the PLA have even trained on.",336344107ef905aea335cb618ad19d905de47e40,True,False,,,,,0,1652673538,,0,{},i8s409i,False,t3_unsuhc,False,False,t1_i8rtyyo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unsuhc/the_plas_evolving_outlook_on_urban_warfare/i8s409i/,1652673554,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652644738.0,

There's also nothing sinister in the channels through which protest videos reach people on the other side. There's always somebody recording, and people who record videos share them. You will find out, like the armies did, that it is almost impossible to prevent people from recording stuff, even stuff damaging to their own side.

Why were the separatist protests not retweeted by pro-Western sources like the Lviv ones were by pro-Russian? That at last, is an intriguing question. My assumption would be - because the videos of both appeared on Telegram, and the Russians use it far more than the Westerners.

NATO has no effect in the Pacific as its AO is limited by the treaty that created it. So instead of NATO, we have a collection of alliances and mutual defense treaties. The United States has mutual defense treaties with the Philippines and South Korea where the treaty between Japan and the United States might as well be a mutual defense treaty with benefits. 

I would’ve like to say the West can count on the Philippines, Japan and South Korea to react to Chinese aggression but the actions of the Duterte administration and the election of Bongbong Marcos puts the Philippines in an awkward position. They are unable to side with China, however, inaction is already a large risk, especially when the Sulu Sea and the southern part of the Luzon Strait would be free for Chinese submarines to pass through. In other words, the Philippines slipping towards neutrality is bad for the “First Island Chain”. 

However, the United State’s influence goes beyond those treaties. ANZUS which is an alliance between the United States, Australia and New Zealand allows for cooperation against a common threat. There is no defense structure nor commands like NATO nor is it without controversy due to New Zealand’s opposition to nuclear anything. Thus, New Zealand is partially suspended. However, the United States still maintains a close relationship with New Zealand.  AUKUS is a technological cooperation treaty between the USA, UK and Australia to develop technology and strategies in addition to assisting Australia with acquiring nuclear powered submarines. And then there is “Five Eyes”, that being an alliance comprised of the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand that shares intelligence of various types. Technically this is from multiple treaties but it is often just lumped together into this category. So, in all, we can definitely expect assistance from Australia and the United Kingdom. New Zealand will be conditional and obviously, no nuclear arms may be allowed on or near New Zealand. The United Kingdom will likely assist as well as Canada. 

Okay, and then the Second Island Chain. Generally, this is the Bonin Islands (I believe Iwo Jima is part of that island chain), the Northern Marianas Islands, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. Well, the Compact of Free Association exists where the United States is basically responsible for the defense of Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. And for clarification, the Northern Marianas Islands and Guam are US territories. 

So, what is this “Island Chain” madness? Well, think of it as a blockade. China relies on exports. If you are able to contain China, then China will eventually fall. That is the island chain idea in a nutshell. Problem is, the Solomon Islands puts a dent in the Second Island Chain as the Solomon Islands is past it. However, in the event of war the question of how would China resupply the Solomon Islands in the event of war? A “Yulin” Express wouldn’t work too well. However, that depends on a lot of factors.

You’ve probably heard of ASEAN as an economic association. To keep things short, think ASEAN as a less centralized version of the European Union. However, I don’t expect it to survive in one piece. Sino-Vietnamese relations are tense, considering the situation in the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands. Laos is generally aligned with Vietnam and is probably Vietnam’s closest ally although they do not share a defense treaty. However, China has been improving relations with Laos during the past 3 decades.

Cambodia is well, Cambodia. Cambodia has economic ties to both China and Vietnam however, their relationship are not straightforward. Some of the Khmer people of Cambodia believe that the southern tip of Vietnam is rightfully belong to Cambodia as it was formerly Khmer land. However, the two governments have reaffirmed their “friendship”. However, public opinion of Thailand and China are better than that of Vietnam. This is most likely due to the conflicts between Vietnam and Cambodia and their predecessor states, which I won’t get into. Cambodia may be a toss up.

Thailand will become a diplomatic battleground between the United States and China as both China and the US hold favorable relations with the nation both in economic ties and security matters. Thailand is a toss up.

Myanmar. It’s almost guaranteed they will side with China. 

Singapore will likely become western aligned as Singapore shares some interests with the United States. However, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has stated that Singapore is not an American ally, that they will not be involved with a war involving America nor will they call for American military assistance despite American forces being able to operate out of Singaporean bases. I doubt that Singapore will be able to fend for itself and will ask for assistance regardless of what the prime minister said as the statement are mere words.  Not even a law nor constitution. 

This also bring me to another alliance, because there wasn’t enough clutter already. The Five Powers Defense Arrangement between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom is rather similar to ANZUS, however, the arrangement only calls for consultation and nothing more. 

Malaysia will likely side with the United States due to their economic and military ties. However, once again, China is attempting to improve relations despite disputes over the South China Sea.

I know Indonesia has had joint military exercises with the United States so I do expect Indonesia to side with the West. Although, it should be noted that the corruption within the Indonesian government is rather infamous. 

Timor-Leste. This is one I can’t call but frankly, my gut says “neutrality” until action occurs. Ties between Australia and Timor-Leste are strained and their ties to other nations isn’t strong enough to make a call. 

For Fiji, China isn’t their friend. So they will likely be Western aligned as they do support Taiwan. 

Another country of note is Vanuatu. President Tallis Obed Moses had stated his wishes for the United States military to open a base in Vanuatu which would put the Solomon Islands from the grill to an oven. However, China and Vanuatu share strong relations with each other and there is a rumor of collaborations to build a Chinese military base there. So, Vanuatu is nominally leaning Chinese but, it is in question. 

Papua New Guinea seems to lean toward the Chinese position with economic aid and the government switching from western military training to that of the PLAN. 

And of course, Taiwan is already west aligned.

India’s involvement will depend on China’s actions.

So in short… It’s a complete and utter mess. Somebody, please make the “Pacific Treaty Organization” or something. Regardless, this was what I could gather quickly. Some will ally with the west but the situation is still developing as China proceeds to improve relations with its neighbors in order to undermine western influence in the region.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,[],,,,text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False,"&gt; So pro-RU Telegram accounts are disseminating videos of street protests against Ukrainian mobilisation

Yes, Ru Media/Govt is feeding it to them.

&gt;(to undermine the Ukrainian morale). 

Yes, the *reason the ru media/govt is feeding them those videos* is probably to undermine UA morale and boost Ru morale. 

The Ru telegram accounts themselves, are just willing dupes happy to be fed exclusive material they can use to expand their channel.

&gt;Makes sense. 

It does.

&gt;They are, however, also disseminating videos of street protests against separatist mobilisation 

Are they ? The Ru-media and government ? I don't think they are.

I'm not even sure the pro-Ru telegram channels are disseminating them, but the Ru media/govt. certainly aren't,

&gt;(to undermine the separatist morale??).

No, why would the Ru media/govt do that?

Again, I doubt the pro-Ru Telegram channels themselves are even publishing any/a lot of that stuff either.... but the Ru media/govt. certainly isn't.

&gt;Why are these videos not more widely disseminated through all available channels? Because those protesting against mobilisation on both sides know they are likely to end up in jail, if not worse, if they start attracting too much attention.

First, *THEN HOW DID THE PRO-RU ACCOUNTS GET THE VIDEOS?*

If they didn't post them anywhere, how did Pro-Ru accounts get hold of them and post them everywhere ?

Do they have access to some sort of ""source of these videos"" that no-one else has ? Who do you think that source might be ?

Second, we were discussing a) Women openly protesting outside UA army offices in broad daylight with their faces uncovered and b) What purport to be active TD units saying they won't fight on video, in broad daylight, with their faces uncovered too.

If they feared for their lives/jail ..... they did exactly the wrong thing being there in person, showing their faces and videoing it.

What did they think was going to happen ? 

They clearly are not all that afraid of jail. 

And why record yourself on video.... and then send it to Russian Telegram channels that support the war ? How does that help them stay anonymous, *of course* those guys are going to splash it everywhere.

You think these people protested/deserted, didn't conceal their identity, *video'ed themselves in these acts*, then declined to publish the videos they'd recorded openly and publicly but *did* decide to send those videos to Pro-Ru/Pro-war accounts to publish on their behalf ?

Again. If they aren't posting these videos anywhere..... how are the Pro-Ru accounts getting them all the time and publishing them ? Who is giving these videos to the Pro-Ru accounts ?

&gt;If you are trying to say that the Russian intelligence services have managed to organise street protests against mobilisation in Lviv and Zakarpattia, the hotbeds of Ukrainian nationalism, then Ukraine is thoroughly subverted. 

No. They organised pro-russian protests in every western capital you care to name over the past few weeks. They aren't all hopelessly subverted either.

It turns out, if you are a fairly free state where people are allowed to protest..... and you have a city of millions of people.....its fairly easy for the Russians to find enough people sympathetic to their cause to turn out a few dozen people to protest for something, video it, and therby give the Ru govt. some valuable propoganda material.

Are Greece, Ireland and Germany hopelessly subverted states ? Because there were protests the Ru media used for propoganda puposes in Athens, Dubin and Berlin recently.

&gt;Still, I don't understand why they are organising similar protests in rebel Donbas.

Who said they were organising similar protests in rebel Donbas ? I'd expect the SBU to be organising those if anyone.

I'm just not seeing eh co-ordinated push about them all across twitter that I am seeing from the Pro-Ru accounts with the TD Brigades thing.

I tripped across the TD thing because all the pro-Ru accounts were posting it everywhere..... I only learned about the Luhansk protests thing when you drew my attention to it here, and I went and searched it out...... despite reading probably 3 to 4 times as many pro_UA accounts as Pro-Ru sources.",ce5a213a4015e19d52eb298d669f4d81f925b35e,True,False,,,,,0,1652660002,,0,{},i8rcnd0,False,t3_uq4l37,False,True,t1_i8r7t8v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8rcnd0/,1652660020,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652631202.0,
