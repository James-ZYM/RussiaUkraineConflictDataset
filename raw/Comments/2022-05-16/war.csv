Donbass was different issue altogether. It was started after Crimea annexation because Ukrainian hates Russian who took Crimea from them and attacking Donbass because they are ethnic Russian.

Now why crimea happened? Because of maidan riot.

Now why maidan riot happened? Because Yanukovitch postponed the agreement to join EU.

Now why Yanukovitch postpone the signing? Because first Ukraine need financial reform to join EU (in other words they are too poor) and if Yanukovitch continue and getting financial help (in other words borrowing money) from the EU it will leads to economic disaster because the interest rates is high. Not to mention they will lose benefit from Russia such as free trade and have to return the money lent by the Russian previously.

So I think you need to understand what is the action and reaction behind before saying something.

Lastly, without having written statement on paper that Ukraine will not join NATO it will be very easy to come back to this again in the future. It is exactly what happened now.

Same thing can be said to NATO. If Ukraine is not eligible anyway why don’t they put it in paper and save lives? Apparently NATO’s ego is more important than the lives of Ukrainian.

Like. If she wants to either help her abuser or she's doing this for revenge. Are you serious. 
The local law enforcement is so outdated, mysoginistic and all so they knew the investigation wouldn't be fast. So many expat women here being raped by Korean guys and say the same thing.
And there are so many more stories with it. They harassed her so she would drop her case. But she didnt and she fought till she couldn't take it anymore and decided to kill herself.

The affiliation is that one of your soldier, assaulted her, sexually assaulted her, and gaslighted abused threatened her. That makes her victim of the solider from your US army. The cover up is real.

Thats nice, I can only go on what is stated by NATO themselves.   Point 6, chapter 1.

""States which have ethnic disputes or external territorial disputes, including irredentist claims, or internal jurisdictional disputes must settle those disputes by peaceful means in accordance with OSCE principles. Resolution of such disputes would be a factor in determining whether to invite a state to join the Alliance.""

Ergo, Russia creating external territorial disputes may be one mechanism they could use to interfere with the ability of Ukraine to join NATO.  It's literally written in the rules.  I can't speak of the conditions of the rules in 1952 when Turkey joined.  Where they the same then?  Where there extenuating circumstances?  I don't know.  Do you?
