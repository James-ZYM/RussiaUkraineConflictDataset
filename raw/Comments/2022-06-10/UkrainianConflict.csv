Again, common sense, but apparently some people had forgotten during the intervening centuries (possibly around 1700-1716).",28a6d3bab768ac8461d2941ec756c9a9c890dfe1,True,False,,,,,0,1654903874,,0,{},ibwys1v,True,t3_v91l5d,False,True,t1_ibw2mto,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v91l5d/the_eu_should_forget_about_sanctions_theyre_doing/ibwys1v/,1654903886,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654875074.0,

*On Friday, 10 June, anti-aircraft missiles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed the 500th Russian target.*  
  
*Source: Yuriy Ignat, spokesman for the Air Force Command, in a comment to ""Ukrainska Pravda""*  
  
*Quote: ""The ‘Anniversary’ target was another Orlan-10 UAV of the Russian invaders. We were hoping for a little more, but ruscist aircraft are not frequent guests above the territory controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""*  
  
*Details: According to Ignat, since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, anti-aircraft missile forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been destroying all types of air targets: aeroplanes, helicopters, cruise missiles, UAVs, and sometimes missiles fired by operational and tactical systems.*  
  
*On 10 June, two Orlan-10 operational-tactical UAVs were destroyed by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Two more Orlans were shot down by the air defence of the Ground Forces.*  
  
*The spokesman added that the strike aircraft of the Air Forces have conducted missile and airstrikes on Russian equipment, positions, and field infrastructure. At least five armoured vehicles have been destroyed and several dozen Russian occupiers have been killed so far.*",898d0c2d50eb2199698ea89f5c316b6ca9b4fe15,True,False,,,,,0,1654901389,,0,{},ibwtwdn,True,t3_v9jpfd,False,True,t3_v9jpfd,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9jpfd/antiaircraft_gunners_of_the_air_force_of_ukraine/ibwtwdn/,1654901402,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654872589.0,

There better be enough NATO  weaponry, vehicles and ammunition to replace this but...just come out and say it. Fuck, replacing this all during peace time would take a decade.

The bridge to enter Kherson proper from the south is almost *ten kilometers* east of the Kherson city center.

That means if Ukraine can secure the east, Russia would have to make the difficult choice of withdrawing before fighting has even reached the city, or else risk having all their forces trapped in the city, potentially with the bridge then being blown up and denying any hope of relief. Russians are unlikely to pull a Mariupol for that city.

The good thing is that this could mean no brutal street fighting would be required.

Whatever Russia, China decide to do, it will always be less worse than nuclear holocaust. Cause you know, in such a case it's not thousand life, it's billions of life that would be lost.

Good thing tho, we have nuke of our own, so they cannot try anything directly at us either. We are all condamned to point a gun at each other and do nothing whatever the other do unless he shoot at you. 

There is nothing that can be done and that's the world we live in since the US dropped nuke on Hiroshima. That's why great power never went to war with each other in almost a century.

US SEAD and datalinked systems to track and target enemy air defenses is just too good. You also have to consider how many air defense system Russia has that can actually threaten fast aircraft above 25,000 feet. A B-2 at high altitude can lob a GBU 30 miles. That doesn't leave much time for an SA-300/400 to acquire and fire on that aircraft before it's turning away and out ranging your missile.

He also mentions advantages for Russian aircraft in thrust to weight ratio. Even if dogfights did occur, training with modern aircraft is much more important than that small advantage. Aggressor squadrons take on pilots in older, obsolete aircraft. They win in BFM against aircraft that have all the advantages because they know how to control themselves and their aircraft. That takes skill, discipline and a lot of training. Given what we've seen from Russia, I don't think they have the latter. Modern fighters are fly by wire.

    We don’t hand them out they purchase them and go through a background check. 

Should we sell guns to people convicted of violent felonies? Terrorists? Gang members? People that are mentally unstable? A mandatory class doesn't mean they can't get the gun. It just means they have go through the process.

    Violent felonies are illegal, being a terrorist is illegal. These criminals don’t buy guns legally they steal them, or buy them on black markets/non legitimate sales. 

We aren't under a nazi or communist regime in America.
    
    Germany wasnt always nazi, Russia and China weren’t always oppressed and brutalized by communist regimes. Hell from 2016 to 2020 we lived under a Nazi Regime just ask liberals. 

Public health measures during a global pandemic. I don't know what this has to do with America's terrible gun laws.

    Really pretty simple if you began taking people against their will into quarantine camps in America you would get shot. In Australia it was possible because they had their rights removed. Which opened the door to have more rights taken away. 

So what’s your solution to this exactly? I’d like to not worry when my kids are in school as well. But the solution isn’t taking guns away from people.

   The cool now look at the other Gun Crimes in the uk…they do exist. School violence exists all over. You can point to Finland if you would like. They had a shooting in 2007. If your solution is confiscating guns will you be going to take them from law abiding citizens? Or will you allow others to take the fall? 

   Illegal gun sales is a 10 year felony. Do the research and look up how many get prosecuted? Our own presidents son purchased a pistol illegally  how was he punished. The fix is to harden our schools, fund mental health programs, hammer these kids when they become known to be an issue in school, harsher penalties for threats against schools. Most of these kids come from broken homes and have long histories of red flags and mental health issues. 

The UT tower sniper was in 1966. There was the Candem Shootings in 1949.  Population demographics over the last 100 years have shifted with many more people living in densely populated urban environments.

    Wow you found two shootings one which was perpetrated with a bolt action hunting rifle and one which was done with a 9mm “lung blower” pistol with an 8rd magazine. The fact is society has become more violent and mentally unstable and that needs to be treated. Guns are harder now than ever to get yet these things are happening exponentially more often. More people are killed by knives and happens every year than rifles look up the fbi statistics.

It has its issues mainly pertaining to the waste and storage of said waste but that’s been solved in some country’s that still operate many reactors. It would cover the majority of fossil fuels use, we’d still need some as the grid fluctuates and nuclear is only a baseline source it can’t ramp up quickly. But it wouldve put most of our CO2 generators off line till renewables became extremely viable in the sense we had proper storage to be completely reliant on them and not nuclear. Fusion is still an option but, “it’s always another 40 years away”. If we had embraced nuclear more our global carbon output would’ve been much better and we wouldn’t have see as much of an environmental impact yet. Yes we would have mass amounts or radioactive material to deal with but that doesn’t destroy the entire planets environment on its own, it needs some help to do that. It won’t save us now, it’s too late as an option to switch too due to too much opposition and time to build, renewables are too far advanced to consider it, storage is just a problem. Basically we miss 50 years worth of nuclear power that would’ve cut carbon emissions as a stop gap till renewables got going well. Hippies aren’t the or anymore, they just put us in a worse position as renewables don’t have the storage to lean on to be effective.

He thinks the border shifts would be permanent, while everything else can be fixed by successors. Russia will be safe behind its nuclear shield, and the West is too weak to rollback a settlement.

Some of the stuff around the Popasna pocket seems a little conservative as far as Russian control is concerned. The Ukrainians are unlikely to have a presence across the path to Lyman past the bridge, since they blew it up. It would be pretty stupid to blow up your only escape route before you actually fall back.

The area across the river from Sydorove, which I believe is a national park of some kind, could have some Ukrainian forces. Basically, I don't believe that if that area is fully controlled that the Ukrainians would stick around north of Sydorove even on their side of the river for very long, unless they are extremely confident in their defense. I think they are there, but not further than Sydorove. The livemap also does not report shelling north of there, which is further confirmation. 

So they are probably in Sydorove on their side at least until Dolyna falls, which will probably be any day now, it's not exactly a stable position when it is surrounded on three sides. From the West from Dovhenke, from the north and the East from Svyatogorsk.

&gt;

Planning is great. Preemptively handing out guns to anyone that managed to survive 18 years isn't a real plan.


&gt;Although training should be encouraged it should not be forced as it is a right that all people have. 
&gt;

Should we sell guns to people convicted of violent felonies? Terrorists? Gang members? People that are mentally unstable? A mandatory class doesn't mean they can't get the gun. It just means they have go through the process.

&gt;  The systematic murder and oppression of just about everyone under nazi and communist regimes. 
&gt;

We aren't under a nazi or communist regime in America. 

&gt;The placing of people in camps or basic house arrest in Australia for not complying with Covid regulations. Being arrested in England for saying things the gov disagrees with. 
&gt;

Public health measures during a global pandemic. I don't know what this has to do with America's terrible gun laws.

&gt;I'm not interested in ""taking the power back"". 


&gt;  So what’s your solution to this exactly? I’d like to not worry when my kids are in school as well. But the solution isn’t taking guns away from people. 
&gt; 

If the goal is to stop school shootings then taking guns away from people is exactly the answer. The last school shooting in the UK was in 1996.

Other suggestions include - aggressive buy back programs that are well funded, red flag laws, reduction in production of new firearms by corporate gun manufacturers, safe storage laws, harsher penalties for illegal gun sales, and wait periods after purchasing a firearm.


&gt;Just like taking your car away because people drive drunk is wrong. Up until the 20’s you could buy fully automatic weapons off the shelf no background check needed. Up until the 60’s you could mail order guns to your door. No checks needed. So explain to me what changed because guns are harder to get now than anytime in the last century. Yet shootings like this didn’t happen?
&gt;


The UT tower sniper was in 1966. There was the Candem Shootings in 1949.  Population demographics over the last 100 years have shifted with many more people living in densely populated urban environments.

The US video is from training (notice the small powder charge), thus they are being very deliberate with their actions - speed is not the focus. The section chief is validating every single step before execution (e.g. checking the fuse setting) as his career is riding on every round sent downrange. If they were supposed to fire a round with an impact detonation setting, but the fuse was set for airburst - his career would likely be over. There are other examples in the video where he takes the time to validate every detail. This could also be a new crew member going through initial training with the crew.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

That much? If we take the last Ceasar 6x6 (the next generation not the current one) exports, the 9 systems bought by Belgium were reportedly for €62m so ~€6.8m a piece. The current version was purchased by Indonesia ten years ago, 37 guns for $4.5m a piece. Of course time and the size of the order explain in part the variation in price.  Morocco purchased two years ago 37 pieces as well but for 4,7m in euro this time. So potentially around ~€4-5m for one piece.

I think the Caesar's strong point over the Archer is paradoxically its absence of full auto system. The loading system of the ceasar is external and easy to bypass if need be, its more an assitance, both on the 6x6 and the 8x8 version, the servant merely giving the shell to the machine by hands. In short, it is lighter and simplier and easy to bypass. The Caesar saw combat far from home: Afghanistan, Mali, Syria and in Thailand and Saudi Arabia/Yemen as well. In some theatre the simpler the better.

&gt; Poland has “weakened” its own military potential by using its own capacity to supply Kiev with “a large number of tanks,” Duda said, adding that Warsaw had expected support from NATO, and Berlin in particular.

.

&gt; Most of Poland’s tanks are German-made Leopards, the president explained, adding that Berlin earlier promised to replace military hardware delivered to Ukraine.

..

&gt; “Germany promised to deliver these tanks to us. You have not kept that promise. And, frankly, we are very disappointed about this,” Duda told the paper.

...

&gt; Last week, Germany announced another such swap, this time with the Czech Republic. Prague is now expecting to receive 15 Leopard 2 tanks from German stocks in exchange for tank deliveries to Ukraine.

[No Tanks for Warsaw? Poland Accuses Germany of Withholding Military Aid.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/no-tanks-warsaw-poland-accuses-germany-withholding-military-aid-202693)

&gt; After Duda’s remarks were announced, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock urged patience, claiming that Berlin could not deliver its tanks “at the push of a button or at the snap of a finger,” according to Die Welt.

.

&gt; Baerbock emphasized that tanks delivered to Poland could not damage the readiness of existing German stocks, and needed to be “available, repaired, or re-ordered accordingly” before a transfer could take place. 

.

&gt; The foreign minister indicated that she would meet with her Polish counterpart, Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, in order to resolve “ambiguities.” German defense officials also indicated that the swap deal would include the Czech Republic as well.

&gt; ""The authorities of the Republic of Poland ... are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the ministry said.

.

&gt; ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" it said in a statement.

[Blinken releases decoy, trades F-16s for Polish MiG-29s, offers MiG-29s to Ukraine](https://inf.news/en/military/9ed20a58ebc6f01162b4a74656cbdd35.html)

&gt;Blinken , the U.S. secretary of state , has now admitted to entering Ukraine briefly and met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba. In an interview with CNN in Poland, Blinken said: ""We're working with Poland to see if we can fill whatever they're offering to the Ukrainians.""

.

&gt;Blinken's implication is that the Polish government will come forward and provide Ukraine with 31 Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets currently in service with its Air Force . Then, the United States will provide Poland with American-made F-16 fighters to make up for the loss in the number of fighters caused by the Polish Air Force supplying Russian-made MiG-29s to Ukraine.",a19ca4026478176152516dbbb51bce3e9b963262,True,False,,,,,0,1654886260,,0,{},ibvwznt,False,t3_v8qe0c,False,True,t1_ibu6byu,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8qe0c/poland_has_sent_over_240_tanks_2_billion_worth_of/ibvwznt/,1654886278,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654857460.0,

Mainly, since from I know about the current conflict is that it has become a slow artillery war.

What matters is the present day agreed upon borders and the manner in which they are contested.

  
Take Crimea for example, which was first colonized by Greeks, the Persian Empire, the Byzantine Empire, more conflicts and eventually Ottoman Empire, still further conflicts between all the surrounding groups, eventually an agreement under the Ottomans to be one territory, then Russia Empire annexed it, then the Russian Revolution made it somewhat autonomous, Khrushchev assigned it to the Ukraine SSR in the 50s, then Ukraine kept it when the USSR fell.

  
So Crimea being Ukraine is recent history, but if you go back to these other arguments for who owns territory it could be argued Turkey owns it. If the Soviet Union was oppressive as you say, then was granting Crimea to Ukraine to administer an act of oppression?

  
Now I happen to believe Crimea shouldn't have been invaded by modern day Russia, but I also don't think the logic stands in these appeals to history because it requires we pick some arbitrary ""correct"" time in history for which to freeze territory ownership. But this ""correct"" time is completely subjective and could be claimed by any country. It doesn't actually determine anything really, what does is/was the present day border agreements and the manner in which they were contested, which is why I disagree with how Russia ""took back"" Crimea and claims other land in Ukraine ought to be considered Russia.",42f67ea011d1424087ad572ad529a5ae78331827,True,False,,,,,0,1654883786,,0,{},ibvrbvc,False,t3_v997by,False,True,t3_v997by,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v997by/kyiv_was_founded_in_482_in_1147_the_grand_duke_of/ibvrbvc/,1654883799,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654854986.0,

Russia hasn’t done any successful offensive that’s probably right, and they do it at high costs. But Russia can afford more easily than Ukraine to take losses. They have more men (which they can bribe to go to war or eventually mobilise {idk of the mobilisation part is possible}) and Ukraine is already at its 2nd or even third round of mobilisations, without counting the probability that men who haven’t been yet mobilised go voluntarily to defend their country. 

It’s been 1 day since I looked liveuamap, and Severodonetsk seems each day closer to a total encirclement. Maybe it was a trap, but I could have misfired unfortunately…. 

The Ukrainian army is depleting itself of men and equipment (TDF sent to front lines). I don’t know how much equipment is in Severodonetsk, but if they loose it, it’s probably going to be catastrophic….. 

I know that I have a very pessimistic picture of the current events. And I don’t really know what to do about it. I just hope that Ukraine wins.

Belarus would follow, as internal opposition challenges the dictator puppet who no longer has outside support.

Just like taking your car away because people drive drunk is wrong. Up until the 20’s you could buy fully automatic weapons off the shelf no background check needed. Up until the 60’s you could mail order guns to your door. No checks needed. So explain to me what changed because guns are harder to get now than anytime in the last century.

He would likely have kept the troops rolling into Moldova, then announced that Russia has a union state with Ukraine Belarus and Moldova as part of it, after of course holding the Abkhazia and South Ossetia referendums.

After that he’d probably quickly start repressing the countries and conscripting Young men from round these territories while also spending billions on covert operations in Georgia and “provocations” to basically make it clear to Georgia.. “either join the union or we will have a repeat of 2008” and what hope would Georgians hold after their past experience and after seeing Ukraine fall in days?

All putin would have to do is start shelling territory around the “republics” and claim the republics “also claim such and such land” and that’s the solution is. For Georgia to join a path towards the union state.


It’s absolutely crazy because Ukraine basically saved us from waking up to that about now..

Europe basically lost for however long this new kleptocratic psychopathic hell hole decides to last.

Yet still we have politicians that don’t get it.

It will never be as cheap and as politically affordable to fight against this as giving Ukraine everything possible.

Give them 100 HIMARS and replace them as need ve, start covert training on Bradley’s and hand me down abrams and f15s so they can be handed over in a year.

We should have given Ukraine the heavy weapons to crush the Russian army two months ago at minimum and they’d have obliterated them as they were regrouping and reforming.

Because seriously what was the alternative?

Putin could have basically declared a new corrupt and psychotic bargain USSR and immediately threatened the most dithering countries with cutting off gas.

He would also have been able to control all that grain and immediately declared that any sanctions are the reason why Africa is starving and removin sanctions would be how he starts exporting Ukrainian grain again.

So  I really can’t understand why people can’t appreciate how serious this is.

It was never about NATO.. sure that is part of the security architecture and would stifle putins invasions for a while…


But does anyone seriously think if the Russian military hadn’t been embarrassed and they’d just taken over Belarus( already have), Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia:

If putin started threatening that the baltics must give up their eastern Russian majority regions, or it could mean a nuclear confrontation if not a rapid invasion.. there would be loud voices demanding “negotiations”.

Especially if we have politicians of certain countries talking about the disrepair of their military and lack of equipment. We would also have the balance of power with gas hugely different, I think certain governments would buckle.


That’s why even NATO is vulnerable as if we were taken that far off guard and we have such disunity and lack of priorities at times- we could be totally outplayed.


I think in the end all it would take is an isolationist US president implying the USA would not help and then you’d have certain politicians running to putin to secure gas and also demanding that the baltics cede land for peace. And a lot of talk of “ we wouldn’t be able to beat the Russians anyway”. Which could be true if the amount of dithering allowed them to then multiply their army with hundreds of thousands of conscripts from multiple vassalised countries.",026994d45c84895496879882e6c8659fad09180b,True,False,,,,,0,1654877069,,0,{},ibvbbtu,False,t3_v9677k,False,True,t1_ibuxrz8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9677k/the_security_service_of_ukraine_sluzhba_bezpeky/ibvbbtu/,1654877083,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654848269.0,

Don't conflate the percentages of money Germany pays to Russia with the percentages Russia makes from those resources.

Yes, Germany pays way more for gas than for oil. But the money Russia makes with energy bases by a large majority on oil, and a lot less on gas. Wasn't gas like something between 6-10% of the Russian GDP while Oil is like at 40%? Or something of that magnitude, several times more than gas in any case.

That's why even though Germany pays more for gas than for oil, the influence it probably has on the Russian GDP should be rather small. People seem to paint it like Germany is keeping the Russian state working with their gas payments, which simply is not the case. If Gas is like 4-10% of Russia's GDP, and Germany is not the only gas customer, I really ask myself how much a complete German gas embargo would do.",fbe50e6b9cc22cbaa15d2f94344a2a1ea13fd7f6,True,False,,,,,0,1654873632,,0,{},ibv356x,False,t3_v8jvmx,False,True,t1_ibv0coy,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8jvmx/it_now_turns_out_that_germany_wont_send_the_m270/ibv356x/,1654873648,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654844832.0,

It was known that there was a corruption problem, but I don't think Putin was given accurate information on the extent of that problem. Considering the Russian deployments in Syria were relatively successful, I can see why he would believe the overhyped reports of his generals.

If Zelensky had been a man of weaker character, and fled as they were closing in on Kyiv, 4 hours in the Ukrainian army would have collapsed, allowing him to occupy whatever he wanted east of the Dnieper.

He knew that the full list of consequences that you mentioned were a possibility down the line, but anticipated not having to deal with any of them because of a swift victory. I don't disagree with your characterization of him as a narcissist though, which is why I think he totally skipped on a plan B, and now is in much deeper shit than he expected.

Individually I think he is sane and rational, he just left himself vulnerable and without any reasonable options to choose from.

And even if you disagree with all those points, it's totally reasonable for him to not want to be around other people because of how many people want to shoot him in the back of the head. If I were him and I had just accidentally got myself into way more shit than I was expecting, I wouldn't come out of a bunker for years either.",4715507cff08235402affaf5cb2177549c6206e1,True,False,,,,,0,1654872692,,0,{},ibv0xee,False,t3_v97k9a,False,True,t1_ibuzq29,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v97k9a/vladimir_putin_needed_emergency_medical_help/ibv0xee/,1654872711,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654843892.0,

In reality, SpaceX didn't have enough Raptor 2 engines to even attempt an orbital launch until very recently.

Furthermore, the infrastructure at Boca Chica to enable an full stack launch (Tank farm, Orbital Launch Table &amp; Tower, QD arm ect) wasn't ready for an orbital launch. It's still uncertain when Spacex will be ready, as they still have many tests to do. For example, they have NEVER done static fires on all raptors of superheavy at the same time. 

I'd recon an RUD when they attempt to do so on B7 is \~30%. 

Maybe SpaceX could have launched early 2022 with incomplete infrastructure and limited testing, however if they rushed testing to that extent, I'd say that a RUD &gt;30s in would be over 90%.

According to the sources available from Germany's oil and gas imports and the % of those imports coming from Russia, I would not call oil € ""huge"" and gas € ""not so much"". Id actually say that gas is more € than oil if you use spot prices from today and not what gas price used to be.

I can prove you the fact for the statement I made before about the magnitude of gas and oil revenues for Russian budget: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Russia) There you can find: ""The oil and gas sector accounted up to roughly 40% of Russia's federal budget revenues""

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have actual sources for the euros Germany is contributing to the Russia via oil and gas trade? Sources you can actually link? Because my calculations could be off due to the reason I have to use yearly average volumes and % ratios from import countries. I also have to use current spot prices since I do not know what kind of price Germany has negotiated for oil and gas when trading with Russia. All though if your statement for ""huge"" oil € and ""not so much"" for gas € is accurate, it would mean that Germany get gas from Russia with significant discount compared to spot price.

Some extreme and very clear examples: If you say: ""Mussolini was a fascist"" - that's naturally okay. If you say, Scholz is a fascist, that's in general not okay, and even with an explanation like ""because he doesn't deliver enough weapons"", it'll probably be removed.

Think of a panel discussion or an opinion article in a high brow news paper, what would be okay and seen as appropriate to say there, is also here. To call a junta a ""junta"" is fine. To use ""junta"" in an offensive, overly biased, emotive is not.

And naturally you can call a guy who raped, a ""rapist"". But there we also don't allow generalization / stereotyping - you can't say that all Russian soldiers are rapists.

When we look for an example of such diverse drug use and how it affects the personality, I would actually use Johnny Depp as an example. People love him because of how the drugs influence his ""controlled"" behavior in public, while behind closed doors, there's a very different and unstable version. It wasn't different with Hitler. Germans loved him more than their own children. His personality, everything. It's not just brainwashing. The drugs allowed him to become exactly the ""strong"" figure that the Germans desired as a leader. In Putin's case, we don't really know much about drug use. What we know, though, is that he also is an unstable person behind closed doors. All of his family left him, even left the country.

Great idea! Let's require people to actually take classes and train with weapons before they can buy them.

Are you now upset the French president is looking after French interests? Grow up.

&gt;Push them back out of Ukraine, so that they can't do anything, that is military defeat.

And then what? you think the Russian side will then go ""ah well, we tried""? So you push them out of Crimea and blow up that bridge,...then what? 

Again, Ukraine will never be in a position where it will achieve an unconditional surrender. For that you will have to take moskou and find the shallow grave of Putin. Ain't happening.

This demographic becomes even less minor when you take away states that already have strict gun laws. The system isn't set up so unpopular policies can be pushed, at least not in this case, the system is just set up in a way that population  demographics of the whole of the USA alone don't entirely mean that states will succumb to pressure. At the end of the day if nobody wants guns, it will be extremely easy to push gun laws.

4. ""My comment was a response to how insanely wasteful the MIC is and that a policy can't be just beneficial""

As a whole, the MIC being insanely wasteful might be true, although I would point out that a large part of that is because countries are pushing out technology as the driving factor behind costs. Take the f35 for example, insanely expensive development for both time and money, and now at its maturity it's one of if not the best fighter there is in the world, while being just as cheap as older offerings. A very large part of military budget goes smarter, more precise weapons that affect less and less civilians in an active conflict. Look at russia as a prime example. A country where its entire budget went into corruption and unicorn projects that go nowhere. They use cheap stockpiles of dumb munitions en masse and hit massive amounts of civilian targets. While true that the budget is massive, at the very least in today this money is going into weapons with less collateral damage, than cheaper to produce munitions which in the event of being used, would result in destruction the likes of ukraine.",f7f0f2c331920989a203d2a15c29c6d089530933,True,False,,,,,0,1654869662,,0,{},ibuu0gd,False,t3_v8ryoi,False,True,t1_ibuqw3b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8ryoi/us_general_says_elon_musks_starlink_has_totally/ibuu0gd/,1654869682,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654840862.0,

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s leader has been advised by doctors to avoid making &amp;quot;Lengthy&amp;quot; public appearances after a health scare during a speech, says a Kremlin advisor.

&gt; Vladamir Putin reportedly felt &amp;quot;a sharp sickness, weakness and dizziness&amp;#039;&amp;quot; while getting up from his desk following a recent video conference with advisers and military leaders, reports Telegram channel General SVR. Putin&amp;#039;s health rumours have been circulating following photographs of the leader with a noticeably puffy face believed to be from steroids and reports from government sources that he has cancer and Parkinson&amp;#039;s disease.

&gt; &amp;quot;General SVR reported yesterday:&amp;quot;The indefinite postponement of the Direct Line is due to the unstable health of Vladimir Putin.

Territory can be regained. Russia already lost a load of territory it claimed in the early days.

Economy can survive, they are getting a lot of financial and military assistance from the west.

Its now a largely battle of endurance. On one side there is Russia with a bigger army but so far unwilling to enact mobilization. Plus its also been discovered a lot of Russia's much vaunted army doesn't actually exist, with numbers inflated and equipment either not working or disappeared on the black market. Also morale is a problem since the soldiers don't really know why they are they and are seeing their friends die for no reason while the leaders treat them like shit. On the other side Ukraine has the smaller army but with plenty of conscripts willing to sign up as they are fighting for their country and getting supplied by the west.

Everything he has done has been massively detrimental. It's gone straight past coincidence to a pre-meditated destruction of the entire country. It started by the systematic killing of oligarchs, anyone that had any ability to stop him. 

He's willingly sending tens of thousands of troops to their deaths without any strategic plan whatsoever. Straight to the meat grinder. Its almost like he is trying to get them killed. Removing the military, then forcing all reserves forward to kill them too. He's forcing all of his military leaders to the front lines where they inevitably get picked off, one by one. He keeps enforcing ridiculous timescales to accomplish worthless gains in the Donbass region. 

Every sanction has hit hard. He's holding the world to ransom with food shortages. He is antagonising every single nation he can for no reason while his people will starve. Russia is bleeding youth through immigration, health issues and the war. He's effectively destroying the very future of the country by ensuring there isn't a mass of people for one. 

There are riots, political demonstrations, key infrastructure being destroyed in his own country, yet nothing is done about it. Russia no longer has any methods in which to import the basic necessities to keep an economy alive. 

He's done more to fuel an environmental change in the space of three months than anyone in history. He has almost the entirety of Europe united for the first time in decades, with the US, Japan and Australia on board. No one will buy Russian Oil or gas by the end of the year. 

At this point you have to ask. I know he's ill, and from several sources is battling Cancer. But the key question is, why does Putin hate Russia so much? He's sending them back to the stone age, and it's got to the point where it absolutely looks intentional. Has he finally gotten sick of the way it operates?

SBU: Russians planned to give passports to  residents of Kyiv region with USSR documents

In the event of the capture of the Kyiv region, the Russian occupiers planned to establish an occupation administration here and organize a pseudo-referendum to proclaim a local republic. They wanted to register all residents and forcibly hand out USSR passports in exchange for Ukrainian documents, at least for the first time before the Russian documents were issued.

This is evidenced by the data obtained by the SBU's military counterintelligence on the positions of the invaders, as well as the behavior of racists in those parts of Ukraine that are currently temporarily under their occupation.

In particular, an enemy cache with passport forms of the former USSR was found. It was set up in an abandoned house near the town of Makariv in the Bucha district.

It is noteworthy that these forms were of the Ukrainian model - on behalf of the USSR. Moreover, such a series has not been produced in Ukraine since 1990.

First, Ukraine can't spread war into Russia's terrority (they have nukes). Seoncd, they have long range missiles. After miltary factories are destroyed, Ukraine can only get weapons from other countries. Do you think their supports will last forever?

Opinion - Putin’s Ukraine war draws on his vision of nationalism, exceptionalism

By David Ignatius; June 9, 2022 at 5:20 p.m. EDT

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine represents his version of what a U.S. official calls “Russian exceptionalism” — the idea that Russia is a unique Eurasian imperial system, historically sprawled across two continents, that can play by its own rules.

The official, who specializes in Russia, says Putin is riding the tiger — unleashing an extreme brand of Russian nationalism in taking his nation to war while simultaneously trying to unite the scores of non-Russian ethnic groups that make up the Russian Federation. Some analysts describe his approach as “Russian fascism.” The U.S. official noted that Putin has embraced the militarism of European fascist states of the 1930s, but not the ethnic hatred.

Putin’s dilemma is that he’s using non-Russian troops to suppress a Ukraine that he claims is part of Mother Russia. According to a study of the names of dead or captured Russians early in the war, about 30 percent were from non-Russian groups. Chechens and Dagestanis are dying, but it’s not their fight — unless Putin can wave a Eurasian imperial banner.

Putin tried to do just that on March 3, when he awarded a “Hero of Russia” title to an officer from Dagestan who had died in Ukraine. “I am a Russian person,” Putin said. “But when I see such examples of heroism … I am Dagestani, I am Chechen, Ingush, Russian, Tatar, Jew. … I am proud of being part of this world, part of the strong, powerful multi-ethnic people of Russia.”

One irony of this war is that Putin is mired in the same sort of destabilizing, no-win conflict for which he has often derided the United States. What’s more, he is justifying his “special military operation” with the same passion for regime change that he has mocked in U.S. foreign policy.

The echoes are striking when you look back to Putin’s 2013 op-ed in the New York Times, in which he blasted American military interventions in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. The problem, Putin said, was that America thought it could play by its own rules. “It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional,” he wrote.

Putin revisited this theme in his May 9 Victory Day speech in Moscow. “The United States of America, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, started talking about its exceptionalism, thereby humiliating not only the whole world, but also its satellites, who have to pretend that they do not notice anything and meekly swallow everything.”

This is what psychiatrists call “projection.” Putin was attacking the United States for the very behavior that has led to his ruinous war in Ukraine.

In that speech, Putin expressed his version of Russian-Eurasian exceptionalism. “We remember how Russia’s enemies … tried to seed inter-ethnic and religious strife so as to weaken us from within and divide us. They failed completely. Today, our warriors of different ethnicities are fighting together, shielding each other from bullets and shrapnel like brothers. This is where the power of Russia lies, a great invincible power of our united multi-ethnic nation.”

Russian nationalism has always been a double-edged sword for Putin: He likes the raw passion of its patriotism, but he appears wary of its sometimes uncontrollable ethnic extremism, which might threaten his authoritarian rule over a disparate nation.

Recent Russian history illustrates this tension. Anti-immigrant riots erupted in Moscow in December 2010 after a migrant from the North Caucasus shot a Russian soccer fan. Thirty people were injured in the mayhem, as crowds chanted “Russia for Russians.” Police suppressed the protest.

Similar riots exploded in October 2013 in the Moscow district of Biriulevo, after an Azerbaijani immigrant killed a Russian; police arrested nearly 400 rioters. An assessment by intelligence analysts at Poland’s Center for Eastern Studies explained: “The authorities’ reaction to the Biriulevo incident indicates that they are aware of the scale of social tensions regarding immigration in the city, and want to prevent social unrest from spreading.”

Putin’s regime similarly cracked down on an extreme Russian nationalist named Alexander Potkin, who was known to his followers as “Belov.” He led an ultranationalist group called the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, which was banned in 2011. Potkin was convicted for extremism by a Moscow court in 2016.

One inspiration for Putin’s dream of an exceptional Eurasian empire is the late Russian historian Lev Gumilev, according to the U.S. official. In Putin’s 2016 annual speech to the Russian Federal Assembly, he lauded what Gumilev had called passionarnost, which could be translated as “passionism.” Rather than trying to become Western and bourgeois, Gumilev argued, Russia should recognize that it “owed its heritage more to the fierce nomads and steppe tribes of Eurasia,” as the Financial Times explained in a 2016 essay about the Russian historian.

It would be comforting to think that the Ukraine war and its assault on the European order are simply products of Putin’s fevered imagination. But they have deep roots in the history and culture of the sprawling Russian federation. This truly is a battle of East vs. West — and of two versions of exceptionalism.",7a06bda7d545d5473dbeb3c4f73450303cfdf11e,True,False,,,,,0,1654863180,,0,{},ibuhgaw,True,t3_v96doa,False,True,t3_v96doa,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v96doa/opinion_putins_ukraine_war_draws_on_his_vision_of/ibuhgaw/,1654863196,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654834380.0,

У разі захоплення Київської області російські окупанти планували створити тут окупаційну адміністрацію та організувати псевдореферендум для проголошення місцевої республіки. Усіх жителів хотіли взяти на облік і в обмін на українські документи примусово роздати паспорти СРСР –принаймні на перший час до видачі документів рф.

Про це свідчать дані, які військова контррозвідка СБУ отримала на позиціях загарбників, а також підтверджує поведінка рашистів на тих частинах України, які наразі тимчасово знаходяться під їхньою окупацією.

Зокрема, виявлено ворожий схрон з бланками паспортів колишнього СРСР. Він був облаштований у покинутому будинку поблизу міста Макарів Бучанського району.

5. The origin of the emerald mine story is the [BusinessInsider interview with Errol](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2) - again, someone openly denounced by his family as abusive.

it's a bit the dirty secret of the Nuclear industry. There's a vastly greater need to build storage for nuclear than there is for wind because wind can simply overbuild their turbines and then turn some off when not needed. 

&gt; France currently generates slightly over 70% of their electricity from Nuclear and their grade is stable.

There is no such thing as a French grid. France is part of a vast European grid and when they are overgenerating they ship their electricity all over the continent, including up to Norway where it is stored in pumped storage, on the other hand, when there is a peak of demand they buy in electricity, including from German gas powered peaker plants. 

In a sense, Frances insistence on doing everything nuclear is a perfect complement of Germany's insistence on closing down all the nuclear stuff. One country's stupidity cancels out the other country's stupidity and overall they could have an almost sensible energy policy, if they could only replace their gas with renewables.",eee95480323f5b4489be671bfe14b497b38baec9,True,False,,,,,0,1654860818,,0,{},ibudqez,False,t3_v8xtv7,False,True,t1_ibucpy7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8xtv7/this_compilation_of_clips_explains_why_the/ibudqez/,1654860836,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654832018.0,

I’m a current artilleryman so I can clarify a few observations..

1. The M109A6 crew is conducting a table VI certification, which is essentially a gun/crew live fire evaluation (you can tell from the MG/Smoke/grader sitting on the left side near the ammo counter)

That being said, certification tables will usually be conducted with absolutely correct crew drills, so the crew is more focused on safety, proper commands, and system functionality. The gun can even be fired without the rammer, and that happening is actually very common since they can often break. 

The Russian crew has no identifiable grader for their training so they’re probably just going as fast as possible

2. Both systems are very old. The Army is currently replacing the A6 with the A7, but the fielding takes a long time. My point is, mechanized artillery breaks more than most people realize. There are so many problems that can occur in either system. Maintenance is a constant theme/constraint for mechanized artillery…so the last thing I would want is to rely on a 30 year old auto loader that completely inhibits my ability to shoot the second it malfunctions. 

Anyway, removing the grader swill increase speed. You’ll see some of the craziest shit in some of those paladins.

&gt; &amp;quot;AWS continues to add to over 10 petabytes of essential data already migrated from 27 Ukrainian ministries, 18 Ukrainian universities, the largest remote learning K-12 school, and dozens of other private sector companies. Right now there are 61 government data migrations to AWS, with more expected to come,&amp;quot; Amazon informs.

&gt; It is noted that Ukrainian law required certain government data and select private sector data to be stored in servers physically located in Ukraine before the Russian invasion.

Thats a Republican wet dream. Their opposition to aiding Ukraine is only because its Biden in office and everything is a political attack when you have no ability to actually run a country like the GOP. 90% of them would be doing the exact same thing as the Democrats are doing in this position.

The only ones that oppose it are this new breed of MAGA cult politicians who are suspiciously friendly to Russia and by suspiciously friendly I mean verbally fellating them at every chance they get because Russia helped get their cult leader into power, as admitted by Carlson last week.

BTW, note that this discussion has started with my comment that the government *should* extend the current plants lifetime, so I'm not anti-nuclear in all cases. 

Nuclear *is* good for a very low base power (""baseload"") but that's a surprisingly small amount of the demand. Even there, however, it's very expensive. I was seeing official numbers linked with Nuclear at $100 / MWh whilst wind and solar, *including the costs of transmission and variability* was around $10 or below. What really matters is peak demand which can be many times the lowest demand. One part of that problem is that nuclear is great for baseload but literally cannot reduce off without problems. You need storage for Nuclear just as a place for it to dump extra energy when there isn't enough demand. As you add more and more nuclear to a grid it becomes more and more unstable. 

All of wind, solar and hydro power are great for that flexibility as long as you build them so their peak output is a multiple of expected peak demand. They can then switch off without problem. Wind and solar variability based on weather can be managed by distributing the systems and connecting them with a grid. The wind is always blowing somewhere. 

So the reason that you shouldn't do ""both"" is that extending nuclear more than a little costs too much and takes away money from renewable solutions which could provide much better grid stability.

*Amazon Web Services helped Ukrainian ministries and private companies transfer more than 10 petabytes of data to the cloud following Russia's large-scale invasion.*  
  
*“AWS continues to add to over 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential data already migrated from 27 Ukrainian ministries, 18 Ukrainian universities, the largest remote learning K–12 school (serving hundreds of thousands of displaced children), and dozens of other private sector companies. Right now there are 61 \[Ukraine’s\] government data migrations to AWS, with more expected to come,” Amazon informs.*  
  
*It is noted that Ukrainian law required certain government data and select private sector data to be stored in servers physically located in Ukraine before the Russian invasion.*  
  
*However, a week before the Russian military invaded the country, Ukraine’s parliament passed legislation to allow government and private sector data to be moved to the cloud. To accomplish that, Ukrainian leadership put out a public call for help. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was among the first organizations to respond.*  
  
*Three days after the beginning of Russia’s aggression, AWS specialists began to transfer the data to AWS Snowball devices, ruggedized compute and storage hardware.*  
  
*“AWS is honored to be working alongside the Ukrainian government and other private and public organizations to support the people of Ukraine.

Yes, most families will miss their loved ones. And they might also complain. But the courts will of course rule in favor of the state in most cases. And that's where it will stop for most. They will switch into their typical Russian ""what can you do against the government?"" apathy and that's it.

Their protests might also be considered anti war protests, so you could get up to 15 years prison, which will deter a lot of people. It's also a huge hurdle for people who haven't lost anybody, but are sympathetic and would join them. But 15 years? Better not.

I mean, the war in Afghanistan also brought down the USSR, but that was basically over the course of a decade, coupled with all the other problems they had, economically, etc., and while we have a similar situation with all the sanctions you still have to keep in mind that barely three months have passed.

There was a deal made with Czech that was good enough that they agreed to send more tanks no matter how you want to turn this.

&gt;More then a month ago Slovenia....

If i remember correct Slovenia had elections and the newly elected stopped the deal. Nothing Germany can do about that.

&gt;Poland send tanks and got nothing.

Yeah that is the whole thing about the ring-swap you send usable tanks now and receive tnaks from Germany later when they are ready.

&gt;Germans claims

We don't claim Duda caused enough irritation with his statements in the German government that Annalena Baerbock had to meet with her polish counter part. After the fact Duda walked back on that story. This was not the first time they also tried stupid games with the Mig's and the US.

&gt;Greece will send their BMP-1 only when German marders arrive. That's at least couple of months, and much could change. Besides, those marders could go directly to Ukraine.

Again this is a deal offered if there are reasons they don't like the deal Germany can't force them to take the deal. While initially open for the ring-swap the greek MP got a push back because the changed security situation with Turkey. They want a 1-1 immediate swap for every vehicle. While this would be possible for Germany it would be useless to Ukraine because they need vehicles now and not in a year when they are ready.

To me Russians and their culture comes across as apolitical, even very politicly illiterate, not at all understanding the need for political competence and the importance of citizen engagement in civil society.

Without really caring or understanding Russians have allowed for the killing of free journalism and the growth of a sick taste for autocratic far-right ultranationalism that uses religion and empire nostalgia in a dangerously perthitic self-glorifying manor.

If the information they report on isn't found in other independent newspapers, its most likely false or so heavily sensationalised, that it bears little resemblence to the actual event. The other Springer publications are not as bad, but you should still crosscheck with other newspapers when reading one of their articles.

Better sources are Spiegel, Zeit, FAZ, SZ or Germanys national broadcasting service Das Erste (Tagesschau, DW).

In generall though, its important to distinguish between official government statements and independent press reports. The German government hasn't officially confirmed the donation of MARS 2. Since multiple newspapers reported about it (stating anonymous insider sources) we can assume that it probably will happen, but until theres official confirmation nobody should get their hopes up.

&amp;#x200B;

And criticism about the amount and hestitation of German aid is definitelly valid. Whilst they are somewhere between the second or fourth biggest aid contributor in total numbers (depending on timeframe and whether you count EU funds distribution), they are only somwhere in the european mid-tier when looking at aid per GDP. People rightfully expect more from Europes third biggest weapons manufacturer.

Problem with that, is that Germany basically has no equipment stockpiles left, that they could send. After the reunification 1990 they gifted and sold most of their weapons to other countries (e.g. all of their MIG29s to Poland for 1€ a plane,  over a thousand Leo2A4 for 100k€ a tank etc.). Their defense industry is sizable but needs time to produce new weapons. Lets hope that the military aid swiftly increases in the following months when the first ones roll of the assembly line.",712adb6cc8f6936858904ca8ad139646683b989c,True,False,,,,,0,1654848061,,0,{},ibtyh1n,False,t3_v8jvmx,False,True,t1_ibtus76,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8jvmx/it_now_turns_out_that_germany_wont_send_the_m270/ibtyh1n/,1654848077,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654819261.0,

As much as people want to claim ""Trump derangement syndrome"" on concerns about congressional commitment to Ukraine, he is still a factor for the candidates themselves. The primaries are currently showing that Republican candidates still see that their race is largely about demonstrating loyalty to Trump personally and MAGA politics in general. Some races have turned against MAGA candidates, but most haven't. Given Trump's capriciousness and long-standing pro-Russia and pro-Putin personal beliefs, I do not believe that Kevin McCarthy will withstand the abuse and pursue a robust pro-Ukraine policy if Trump changes his mind and starts being more supportive of Putin again. I think that Mitch McConnell will continue to pursue a pro-Ukraine policy if he believes it's in the best long-term interests of the party.

That is why the radar systems are so much more important. An artillery piece can shoot many rounds per hour, but when it is hit by a counter hit, it is over and done for. Knowing where a shot came from within seconds means that the firing team is still on site and can be hit. This is what they need as well as disruption of the Russian supply lines. The fewer artillery pieces are in action and especially how morbid this is, the fewer experienced crews, the easier it will become to create a tactical advantage and push back the Russians. 

Russia is a different regime and has a lot more people. The easily accessible ones are no longer a viable recruitment target but remember the Western countries see the world go hungry if the war stretches out and you can expect the Chinese to do one of two things: use their hoarded supplies as leverage to ensure shortages and force peace talks. Ukraine can hold of but the price of freedom for 44M Ukrainians against the lives of 150M people that would otherwise starve is not an easy debate. Alternatively the Chinese use their stockpile to buy influence or infrastructure. 
The third option that the Chinese altruistically donate to the UN food program I deem unlikely.

Russia has always relied on heavy firepower to destroy its enemy. Since the end of WWII, they have deployed more artillery systems firing more shells than any other military. This doctrine encouraged them to field more autoloaders and MLRS, so they could pump out more shells in an hour.

On the other hand, NATO focused on completing the task with fewer, but more accurate artillery since the 1970s. This is mainly because they could never match the numerical advantage the PACT owned back then. So more advanced artillery control systems were developed, as well as more precision guns so they could hit closer to the target.

This (шаблона) means a cut-out sample. In addition, the word is given in the wrong form - basic form (шаблон).

I still have a chemical pencil, which it was called in the Soviet Union (inscription on a pencil). The head is not a trash can and I didn't really try to put names that didn't matter to me, and the technical terminology in other languages ​​is very different. I myself use a chemical pencil when I had to create a basic form of gypsum for the creation of artistic ceramic products. 

But for the rest of the things - it was also known how to make different copies, but there were problems with the raw materials. Also, until the 1990s, all equipment that could be used for duplicating, copying or printing (including typewriters and stamps) was on special police records, as were raw materials. The state was very active in ensuring that not all the necessary ingredients were available. The purchase of the most specific equipment or raw materials had to be authorized by the police and accounted for. Artists could not even freely buy the materials needed to make screen printing without presenting a certificate of membership in the Artists 'Union, could not buy as well as professional painters' brushes. Gelatin could be ordered from some pharmacies. Gelatin, which was rarely available in stores, was not of technically usable quality.  
The Soviet Union had a system in place for production, when one thing or raw material could be replaced by a similar one, taking into account only one property of a raw material. There were problems when substitutes began to be replaced. It was practically necessary to make something out of nothing. Now I can laugh at the problems of that time, but Russia still lives there.

It is  difficult for a person living in a normal country to understand how it was possible to survive in those conditions. In order to buy clay, I had to collect several permits from different employees of the manufacturer, nothing was free - I had to pay for each signature and only then could I buy clay (not to sell more than 300 kg). And that was at a time when factories were freer to sell raw materials.

Personally, I am second gen Ukrainian American, so there is a lot of emotion tied up in this whole thing for me.

This war is a lot of things.  Russia and the West by and large just see it as a war for the board seats on Burisma, but to Ukrainians and Poles and the people of the region... this is centuries playing out.  There is an ancestral epic being played out.  

The historic place of Poland as almost the East Gate of Europe, and Ukraine being kind of the West gate of Russia, but also its origin and the whole cossack thing which was really cool...

None of this interests the West. Everything Putin has done has strengthened Western interests. Which is kind of sus. Everyone is joining nato. People are buying their weapons. Predatory loans are being given out. Business is great for the West.  

Afghanistan left a void and with this one they don't even have to send soldiers.

Meh.  I hope after Russia is defeated and the infrastructure is rebuilt, Ukraine nationalizes everything and tells the parasite structure to go fuck itself.  God damn. Trying to turn Ukraine into Korea.

Which is another unforgivable crime the benefactors of the cold war have at their feet.  They split Korea with just zero Korean agency in the whole thing.

But it's like they pushed Ukraine into Russia and now Russia is throwing haymakers at Ukraine going on 8 years to teach the West a lesson. It's wild.

But whats even wilder is how much money the people that have made Yemen into Ukraine for how many years now, that made soldiers in Afghanistan listen to boys get raped because the guys doing the raping were our allies, that just obliterated Libya cuz it was going to a gold standard, and on and on, how much money they are going to be making on this war.

First they sell Ukraine the weaponry on credit, then Ukrainians die and their children's children are still dealing with their payday loans.

That's the kind of not blameless I mean. They are going to buy up the rubble with the money that Ukraine will give them and then have to pay them back for.

The war in Ukraine is not in Ukrainian interests.  It does, however, deeply indebt Ukraine on many levels to the West and is also seemingly crippling Russia.  So it is hugely beneficial to Western powers, who are about as corrupt as Russia, but less brutish and blatant about it. Which is why you can never tell if a Western politician is incompetant or just keeping a fundraising talking point alive by never actually solving the problem they run on.

But I digress. I am Ukrainian. I do not sympathize with Russia. This whole thing is the result of the tug of war over Ukraine that the West and Russia are engaged in. Overall, a net positive for Ukraine to have to deal with Western slant the whole narrative and rob you with inflation to make you do what I want no matter what, vs. The Russian Defenestrationocracy.

I mean, definitely better for Ukraine to be part of the West.  But the West and Russia have been engaged in a dance since before Lenin was born and at no moment has that dance stopped. Though the tune has changed significantly in tone, pace, and melody over the years.

Running Yanukovych out wasn't some CIA plot, but the uprising of the Ukrainian spirit. People were beaten in the streets and held the square through winter. Real as fuck. The CIA definitely had its fingers in it though.  

And Western interests do not align with Ukrainian ones.  Polish ones by and large do, and I expect Ukraine and Poland are gonna be really tight going into the future. Baltics as well. But the fucks that benefit from the cold war?

The institutions that are going to be raking in the interest when Ukraine pays back all the weapons their blood should be enough to pay for?  When the Western enterprises come swooping in for Ukrainians to use American aid to pay them to buy their fucking land?  When every bit of art is infected with the Western mindvirus that lets them all steal and rape children buy sell and end lives with impunity behind a smokescreen of intractable social division and strife?

Fuck man. There is so much more going on here and Ukraine will need another revolution to deal with the West.  Won't be a shooting war.  But this war is the economic conquest of Ukraine by the West.

Not sure why you'd say that. 

In 2020 defense spending was at 3.4% of GDP, compared to 5.2% to social security and 3.7% to Medicare.

Defense is the single largest budget in discretionary spending, by far. 

And when you make those comparisons, please keep in mind that the spending in the last two go directly towards the Healthcare and support of American citizens, whereas defense spending goes primarily towards.. A false sense of security in a post nuclear world? The ability to fight proxy wars in third world countries for their resources? Enriching the private contractors in the military industrial sector?

A [C17 cargo plane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVsnclvw0MQ) (one of the standard U.S. cargo planes) has a maximum payload capacity of  170,900 pounds.

So that's about 1,700 rounds per payload, and per the article, Ukraine is using 5,000-6,000 artillery rounds per day.

So that would be 3 or more cargo planes chock full of artillery rounds, per day, every day, just to keep up with the current demand, plus the convoy of railcars/trucks necessary to get them from whichever NATO base they're landing at, to the front.

And that's just artillery rounds. That's not even including the artillery itself, or the drones, or the missiles, or the missile launchers, or the rifles and ammo, or the helmets and body armor, or any of the other stuff the tens of billions of dollars in American aid are providing.

*****
&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay.

&gt; Skibitsky emphasised the need for the west to supply Ukraine with long-range rocket systems to destroy the Russian artillery pieces from afar.

&gt; In north-east Ukraine, around Kharkiv, he said Russian forces were focusing on defence after Ukraine&amp;#039;s counteroffensive pushed them out of several towns and villages in the region in May.&amp;quot;The threat to Kharkiv has lessened,&amp;quot; said Skibitsky, of Ukraine&amp;#039;s second-biggest city, which has been shelled regularly since the beginning of the war.

China will not/cannot continue to make war if every ship headed toward China was impounded and kept in a neutral port until China ceased hostilities. China is that dependent on oil and other raw materials imports.

Russia, on the other hand, is dependent on exports as well as imports.

4485,[],False,,baaawbag,,,[],,,,text,t2_15rj3b,False,False,"Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said Ukraine is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay.

“This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”.

“Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us,” said Skibitsky. “Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.”

Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, according to Skibitsky. “We have almost used up all of our [artillery] ammunition and are now using 155-calibre Nato standard shells,” he said of the ammunition that is fired from artillery pieces.

“Europe is also delivering lower-calibre shells but as Europe runs out, the amount is getting smaller.”

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said last week that between 60 and 100 Ukrainian soldiers were dying each day and a further 500 were being injured. Ukraine has kept the total number of its military losses secret.

Soldiers speaking to the Guardian from Ukraine’s frontlines this week painted a similar picture.

Skibitsky emphasised the need for the west to supply Ukraine with long-range rocket systems to destroy the Russian artillery pieces from afar. This week the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told the Guardian that Ukraine needed 60 multiple-rocket launchers – many more than the handful promised so far by the UK and US – to have a chance of defeating Russia.

Ukraine is set to ask the west for a list of weapons and defensive equipment at the contact group meeting with Nato in Brussels on 15 June.

Skibitsky thinks the conflict will remain predominantly an artillery war in the near future and the number of rocket attacks – which can be launched from Russia and have hit civilians – will remain at their current rate.

In the first month, Russia was constantly striking Ukraine with rockets but in the last two months it has slowed. Recent figures published by the head of Ukraine’s armed forces assert that Russia launches between 10 and 14 a day.

Rockets are expensive to manufacture. Each rocket can cost anywhere between a few hundred thousand dollars to several million.

“We have noticed that Russia is carrying out far fewer rocket attacks and it has used H-22 rockets; they are old 1970s Soviet rockets,” said Skibitsky. “This shows that Russia is running low on rockets.”

Skibitsky said Russia was unable to produce rockets quickly because of the sanctions and that it had used around 60% of its supplies.

The sound of sirens has become a daily feature for Ukrainians. Sirens regularly sound in multiple regions simultaneously but most of the time, for people on the ground, it passes without a bang. According to Skibitsky, each siren signals a rocket has entered Ukrainian airspace but its impact is not always reported for security reasons.

“The rockets take anywhere from 40 to 90 minutes to impact, depending on where they are launched from … We don’t know where they are going to land,” said Skibitsky. He noted that Russia was currently using long-range bombers which can reach anywhere in Ukraine without leaving Russian airspace.

In terms of the three frontlines, Skibitsky said most of Russia’s forces were now concentrated in the Donbas region and seeking to occupy the administrative borders of both the Donetsk and Luhansk republics. This was the area, he said, where the artillery battles were the heaviest.

In north-east Ukraine, around Kharkiv, he said Russian forces were focusing on defence after Ukraine’s counteroffensive pushed them out of several towns and villages in the region in May.

“The threat to Kharkiv has lessened,” said Skibitsky, of Ukraine’s second-biggest city, which has been shelled regularly since the beginning of the war.

Lastly, in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, two southern Ukrainian regions that Russia almost completely occupies, Russian forces were digging in for the long haul, said Skibitsky. According to him, they are building double, sometimes triple, lines of defence.

“It will now be harder to get that territory back,” said Skibitsky. “And that’s why we need to weapons.”

“If they succeed in the Donbas, they could use these territories to launch another attack on Odesa, [the city of] Zaporizhzhia [and] Dnipro,” said Skibitsky of major cities under Ukrainian control which are in close proximity to the southern Russian-occupied areas. “Their aim is the whole of Ukraine and more.”

Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia can continue at its current rate without manufacturing more weapons or mobilising the population for another year.

Skibitsky does not exclude the possibility that Russia will freeze the war for a period of time in order to convince the west to lift sanctions. “But then they will start it again – look at the last eight years,” he added.",10b6198e75ba95e940521f2012733da61b879639,True,False,,,,,0,1654835824,,0,{},ibtieqt,True,t3_v8zkz4,False,True,t3_v8zkz4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8zkz4/were_almost_out_of_ammunition_and_relying_on/ibtieqt/,1654835837,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654807024.0,

Thriving corruption and censorship, yeah that's probably true.


Fidesz or Victor Orban respectively has a firm grip on Hungary. Almost every media is controlled by the state or an organ which is effectively controlled by Fidesz.

For years Hungary has been subjected to a massive brain drain due to educated and specialized Hungarians seeking their fortune elsewhere, because they can't imagine a future in Hungary in its current state.

It's essentially a Hybrid-Regime at this stage, in the last general election Fidesz reached roughly 50% of the vote (however there are clues that there was manipulation to some extend, especially with mail-in ballots from Romania (where a large Hungarian Diaspora/Minority lives) )

Due to an unfair voting system (it resembles the american one [e.g. winner takes all, etc.]) those 50% were sufficient for Fidesz to reach a two-thirds majority which enables it to basically govern without checks and balances by the opposition.

Since the beginning of the Ukraine-War Hungary has been kept in a state of emergency, which can be prolonged indefinitely by Fidesz. It enables Orban to govern per decree, which essentially circumvents parliament for gouvernment decisions.

So yeah, apparently this is what Reps dream about when debating about Hungary.

Idk, I'm not Hungarian, I love the country and its people, but the government is an absolute, undemocratic shitshow.

4552,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"KYIV, June 10 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces were holding their positions in intense street fighting and under day and night shelling in Sievierodonetsk, officials said, as Russia pushes to control the bombed-out city, key to its objective of controlling eastern Ukraine.

Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk, on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river, are the last Ukrainian-controlled parts of Luhansk province, which Russia is determined to seize as one of its principal war objectives.

Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Thursday the situation in Sievierodonetsk was ""extremely complicated"" and Russian forces were focusing all of their might in the area.

""They don’t spare their people, they’re just sending men like cannon fodder … they are shelling our military day and night,"" Danilov told Reuters in an interview.

Ukraine says its only hope to turn the tide in its favour in the small industrial city is more artillery to offset Russia's massive firepower.

In a rare update from Sievierodonetsk, the commander of Ukraine's Svoboda National Guard Battalion, Petro Kusyk, said Ukrainians were drawing the Russians into street fighting to neutralise their artillery advantage.

""Yesterday was successful for us - we launched a counteroffensive and in some areas we managed to push them back one or two blocks. In others they pushed us back, but just by a building or two,"" he said in a televised interview.

But he said his forces were suffering from a ""catastrophic"" lack of counter-battery artillery to fire back at Russia's guns, and getting such weapons would transform the battlefield.

Reuters could not verify the battlefield reports.

In the south, where Russia is trying to impose its rule on a tract of occupied territory spanning Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, Ukraine's defence ministry said it had captured new ground in a counter-attack in Kherson province.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an evening address that Ukraine had ""some positive developments in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we are succeeding in disrupting the occupiers' plans"". He did not provide details.

Reuters could not independently verify the situation on the ground in Zaporizhzhia or Kherson. Russian-installed proxies in both provinces say they are planning referendums to join Russia.

Thousands of people have been killed and millions have fled since Russia launched its ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour on Feb. 24. Ukraine and its allies call the invasion an unprovoked war of aggression.

Speaking in Moscow to mark the 350th anniversary of Russian Tsar Peter the Great's birth, President Vladimir Putin drew a parallel between what he portrayed as their historic quests to win back what he called Russian lands. read more

""Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia's),"" Putin said.
'WE ARE STAYING'

Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk said about 10,000 civilians were still trapped in the city - roughly a tenth of its pre-war population.

To the west of Sievierodonetsk, Russia is pushing from the north and south, trying to trap Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region, comprising Luhansk and neighbouring Donetsk province.

Russia shelled more than 20 towns in Donetsk and Luhansk on Thursday, destroying or damaging 49 homes, several manufacturing plants, farm buildings and a rail station, said the Ukraine military. Two civilians were killed, it said.

Russia says it does not target civilians.

In Soledar, a salt-mining town near Bakhmut close to the front line, buildings had been blasted into craters.

Remaining residents, mostly elderly, were sheltering in a crowded cellar. Antonina, 65, had ventured out to see her garden. ""We are staying. We live here. We were born here,"" she sobbed. ""When is it all going to end?""

GRAIN

In the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, one of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, a court sentenced to death two Britons and a Moroccan who were captured while fighting for Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported.

Britain condemned the court's decision as a ""sham judgment"" with no legitimacy. read more

Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain and food oil exporters, and international attention has focused in recent weeks on the threat of international famine seen as caused by Russia's blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.

""Millions of people may starve if the Russian blockade of the Black Sea continues,"" Zelenskiy said in televised remarks.

Russia blames the food crisis on Western sanctions restricting its own grain exports. It says it is willing to let Ukrainian ports open for exports if Ukraine removes mines and meets other conditions. Ukraine calls such offers empty promises.",1ef073cc2c1f595eda96de64db6db856a548ae7f,True,False,,,,,0,1654834285,,0,{},ibtfye0,True,t3_v8z5bo,False,True,t3_v8z5bo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8z5bo/intense_fighting_in_ukraines_bombedout/ibtfye0/,1654834299,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654805485.0,

A Russian soldier's wife and kid arrive in Kherson, part of the first wave to occupy the region. The Ukrainian residents carefully watch these newcomers, never letting them feel welcome.

Meanwhile, the insurgency grinds down the occupying RF forces, harassing them in guerilla operations, never letting them sleep. Far from home, the occupiers and their families slowly realize that they're surrounded by Ukrainians.


When Zelenskyy recently said that he was giving ""something"" special to the front line troops, and he mentioned the idea of instilling confidence, that seems to fit with the possibility that newly trained troops will soon cycle into combat. The front line just needs to hold on for a week or two. (One article speculated this might be that ""something"" that is currently a tightly-held secret.)

Assuming that the West will continue to deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine, and they continue to replenish their combat personnel, I find it unlikely that Russia will succeed in occupying any city or town long enough to bring Russian families to populate the area. 

I think it's much more likely that Ukraine will continue mounting a fierce defense, reach a turning point where they are recapturing territory through daily counterattacks, and push back demoralized Russian forces.

&gt;Truman heard about needless waste and profiteering from the construction of Fort Leonard Wood in his home state of Missouri, and he determined to see for himself what was going on. He traveled in his personal car not only to Missouri but also to various military installations from Florida through the Midwest driving approximately 10,000 miles (16,000 km). Everywhere he went, he saw the hard-luck poverty of the working people in contrast to millions of government dollars going to military contractors. Too many of the contractors were reaping excess profits from cost-plus contracts without being held accountable for the poor quality of the goods delivered.

&gt;[Truman formed a] bipartisan special committee . . . in March 1941 to find and correct problems in US war production with waste, inefficiency, and war profiteering. The Truman Committee proved to be one of the most successful investigative efforts ever mounted by the U.S. government: an initial budget of $15,000 was expanded over three years to $360,000 to save an estimated $10–15 billion in military spending and thousands of lives of U.S. servicemen .[2][3][4] For comparison, the entire cost of the Manhattan Project was $2 billion, at the time.[5] Chairing the committee helped Truman make a name for himself beyond his political machine origins and was a major factor in the decision to nominate him as vice president, which would propel him to the presidency after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[6]

4757,[],False,,Muskwatch,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qy9k,False,False,"These stories were told by Talon’s great-grandpa Amos Tallio, who was called Tsukwa. These stories are about his grandpa, Qwyaax, and his grandma, Anuk’palslayc. Qwyaax was from South Bentinck, from Talyu, and made his living as a carpenter, making canoes, bentwood boxes, and all the other tools that people needed.  When Tsukwa was born, his mother died, and he went to live with his Kikya, Anuk’palslayc, and with his Kukwpi Qwyaax, and he lived with them until he went away to school. Here are some of his stories.
My Kukwpi and the Ascw
Kikya, Kukwpi and me were at Talyu in the fall time, when all of a sudden winter came. The cold wind doesn’t come there, it just gets cold. And when it gets cold, the fresh water on the inlet, on the sulut, can freeze in just one night. And that one night that we were there, the sulut froze. Kikya n Kukwpi looked at the ice, and then Kukwpi said “I guess we’re going to be staying here this winter.”  I don’t think that was what they had wanted to do, but now it was what we had to do.
We moved out of our tent and into one of the houses at Talyu, and started getting ready for the winter. We started to get firewood, and we started preparing to get food. 
Once the ice on the sulut was out a long ways, Kukwpi got his axe, and went out to make a trap for seals, for Ascw.
First he chopped a hole in the middle of the ice. Then he started building up the edge of the hole, little by little. He added snow, then added water, making the edges of the hole higher and higher. Pretty soon it was so high, that if an ascw was on the ice, it couldn’t climb over the edges and into the hole. But, when the ascw was underneath the ice, it could swim up, up, up and come out of the hole. Then it would be trapped.
In the morning, Kikya would look outside, and say: “Qwyaax! There are three ascw out there on the sulut.” Then Kukwpi would get his axe, and he would start walking towards the ascw. All animals have things that they like to do, and ascw like to go back into the hole they came out of. The water wasn’t very far away, but the ascw kept trying to get back in the hole. Kukwpi would walk closer, and closer, and closer, but the ascw would never try to run in the right direction. Instead they just kept trying to get into the hole. Kukwpi would hit them on the head, and the Kikya and Kukwpi and me would have food to eat.
That’s what I remember about that.
My Kukwpi and the Quts’ik
When I was small, I lived with my Kukwpi and kikya at a place called Talyu. We stayed in a little house there all winter, while Kukwpi went out to trap animals for their fur. One day while Kukwpi was out checking his trapline. He was walking up the trail, when he met an animal coming down the trail. The animal was a quts’ik, what is called a wolverine.
The quts’ik was grumpy, like quts’ik always are. If they meet you, they never back away, but always come straight on. This quts’ik saw my Kukwpi and he wanted to fight him and maybe kill him, so it attacked him.
So now they wrestled on the ground, Kukwpi and the quts’ik. Kukwpi’s arm was held in the quts’iks mouth, but his thick coat helped him. He managed to reach a stick and started to hit, hit, hit the quts’ik over the head, but the quts’ik just wouldn’t let go. He kept on hitting it until it stopped wrestling him, but it still didn’t let go. It didn’t let go until Kukwpi knocked it unconscious.
When Kukwpi got home that night, he showed us his arm and his sleave, and told me and Kikya his story.
(NOTES – this story takes place in a village on the tide flats between the talheo and nuikw rivers, going up the mountain Asts’lniiklh behind it. It’s mixed hemlock/cedar forest with moss. It could be higher into the alpine, and is probably wintertime since it’s trapping season.
My Kukwpi and the Nutsakwaax
I’ve told you before, how when I was small, I lived with my Kukwpi and my Kikya at Talyu. If you are in the Tallio or Snow or Hans families, this a place where you are from. My Kukwpi was trapping far up the Talyu river there, on the north side. One day now my Kukwpi was just going along, taking a walk through where he trapped for animals on the mountain.
He hadn’t gone too far, when he started to go up a steep trail up the mountain. It was then that he met two wolves, two nutsakwaax, on his path. They were hungry, and they didn’t act like they were scared of him.
As soon as the first nutsakwaax saw my Kukwpi, it started to go right towards him. The other nutsakwaax started to come towards",de83347a72bc675ba6d1b923555437da658d3d35,True,False,,,,,0,1654830154,,0,{},ibt8tis,False,t3_v8hjxr,False,True,t3_v8hjxr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8hjxr/britons_captured_by_russian_forces_sentenced_to/ibt8tis/,1654830169,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654801354.0,

Russian morale is also down the toilet, and some of their troops are now being armed with tech as old as WW2 (Shout out to my boy mosin-nagant)

Ukraine, meanwhile, has no shortage of manpower, as they've enacted general mobilization, and even without that, the fact that their fighting to defend their country and their freedom from destruction by a fascist foreign invader does wonders for recruitment. Add to that, and the endless supply of cutting edge weaponry flooding in from the west, and Ukraine's army only gets larger and better geared while Russia's gets smaller and worse equipped every day.

Woth planes the things arw different, and as it says in the article, the replaced part must be logged and registered (where it was assembled, when, lot no., etc.) things which the russians will sure not do.  So no leasor takes the risk to operate the planes anymore even after let's say they swap the changed parts back with genuien, OEM ones.",f61b2d9cdf50f2cfe6e742f5ab0ab89d4ee09753,True,False,,,,,0,1654826288,,0,{},ibt1byn,False,t3_v8fehc,False,True,t1_ibsm01t,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8fehc/russias_stolen_planes_will_soon_become_worthless/ibt1byn/,1654826304,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654797488.0,

I think the footage of the M109A6 is real, with a couple of caveats. There’s a big cut in the middle. I don’t know to say if this crew is firing at their short burst ROF (which is several rounds in a minute) vs their sustained ROF which is more like 1 round a minute. 

The M109 is fundamentally an old system, even though it’s had lots of upgrades. The M109A7 is the latest version and has more automatic loading, but it’s still old and there are other western systems that shoot faster (PzH 2000, AS-90, etc, etc). I hope Ukraine can get their hands on lots of those too. ROF isn’t everything though.

Russian officials are increasingly taking over governmental positions in occupied Ukrainian territory, advancing the Kremlin's likely efforts to annex occupied areas of Ukraine into Russia as an okrug (federal district).


Russian forces continued to fight for the Azot industrial zone in Severodonetsk under the cover of heavy artillery fire.


Russian forces made marginal gains north of Slovyansk but are likely to face difficulties assaulting the city itself because of the tactical challenges posed by crossing the Siverskyi Donets River.


Russian forces made incremental advances to the east of Bakhmut and will continue efforts to cut Ukrainian lines of communication to the northeast of Bakhmut.
  

Russian forces are likely engaged in limited fighting along occupied frontiers in northern Kharkiv Oblast.
       

Russian forces continue to focus on strengthening defensive lines along the Southern Axis and are intensifying ground attacks in northeastern Zaporizhia Oblast with the support of troop and equipment rotations.",d55db4f3e6ae10b66a00870b320750339cb85ad4,True,False,,,,,0,1654819295,,0,{},ibsngm1,True,t3_v8ukn1,False,False,t3_v8ukn1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8ukn1/russian_offensive_campaign_assessment_june_9/ibsngm1/,1654819306,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654790495.0,
