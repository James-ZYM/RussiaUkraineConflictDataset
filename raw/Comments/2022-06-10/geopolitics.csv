[],False,,BlueNoobster,,,[],,,,text,t2_24x8g1ac,False,False,"&gt;Germany can kind of be considered as a winner, as they might have finally woken from their sleep  from history. Their re-armament could be decades defining in terms of the outcomes it’s gonna have (mainly on their neighbors fears of Germany and on the US already hostile approach).

In what alternative reality do you life?

First: Germany is not rearming, its equippping its army to what it is suppsoed to be foloowing plans from 2014. The army for example currently only has half the operational tanks it already should have had according to its own plans before russia invaded ukraine. Its not a rearmament, is finally actually equipping the military with what it is suppsoed to have in the first place.

Second, what do you mean by neighbours fears of Germany? Even bloody Poland is very much in favour of a militarily strong Poland and France ahs been calling fro Germany to step p militarily for years already. Nobody in europe is afraid of Germany, at least not in a military context. You do know literally everybody in europe is eather in the EU and/or NATO and only Switzerland isnt in eather as far as Germanys neghbours are concerned...you clearly have no idea how europe works. If Germanys neighbours are afraid of anything it would be germanys strong economy and the influence/pwoer on soft politics that comes from that but hardly Germanys military. Short reminder: West Germanys Military during the cold war alone was in airforce and army alone several times bigger and stronger then the current german army. Germany in 1990 had over 2000 Leopard 2 tanks, today its around 250 with plans to go up to 350 tanks. For comparisson Poland alone has nearly 600 tanks. Same with planes where germanys current airforce is pathetic compared to its cold war counterpart. And back then we were only talking about one half of germany, the east germans were the second strongest member of the warsaw pact as well... As part of reunification Germany has to limit its military to 370.000 troops (currently less then 300.000) and on the day of reunification it had nearly 800.000 active soldiers for a short while.

Third, the USAs hostile apporach is mutual since the USA decided to start stupid wars in the middle east and invade or blockade countries europe relied for on energ supply (Iraq, Iran, Venezuela) and most importantly betrayed europeans trust by lying to the world creating fake evidence to legitimize a war of aggression against Iraq (there is a reason only the UK and Poland, both dependent on the USA, followed to Iraq in force). Add to that the Trump period which destroyed a lot of the remaining trust between most EU countries amd the USA with Trump threatening Germany or the EU every week with some other stupid plan (started a trade war with germany over steel, his threatening to move US troops around in europe over night without talking to its NATO allies, Trump threatening to leaving NATO, etc). It takes a LOT that most european coutnries considered RUSSIA under PUTIN a more trustworthy trading partner then the USA under Trump. And the USA basically giving France the middle finger by stealing an arms contract with Australia from them or ignoring them in a pacific defense alliance is just the cherry on top. The USA is definitly not seen as good as before 2001 here in most of europe and US war crimes like the drone war policy (killing 100 civilians for 1 terrorist as acceptable loses beeing the doctrine) gave i9t the rest. Currently its a bid overshadowed by the Russian Invasion of Ukraine but most of the EU members relationship with the USA isnt exactly sunshine and roses. There is a reason France tries so hard to get a europe first defensive alliance as part of the EU going without the USA because the USA and Europe sadly no longer have the same policies, morals and interest ina  lot of major aspects. And its absolutely rediclous of you to say Germany was hostile to the USA, Germany always valued its relationship with the USA a lot (the fact the USA is allowed to use its bases in Germany that are partly paid for by germany to commit drone warfare crimes in the middle east should say enough) but Bush and Trump basically destroyed the rose peddled view most germans had on the USA.  The view in europe is that the USA is basically just another electiona way from doing something dumb that puts all of europe at risk so the goal was to be less relaint on the USA, especially economically and in regards to ressource imports. I mean the fact a countrey like Germany first turned to Quatar for a new gas supplier instead of the USA should tell you enough.

How melodramatic.

&gt;They still haven't beaten Ukraine despite attacking from 3 sides with a massive army. It's like being chased by a pair of midget clowns with sharp scissors.

Russian forces committed to Ukraine do not outnumber Ukrainian forces, yet Russia is still winning the war. Yes the first few weeks were marked by a failed attept to end the war quickly by going in soft and hoping Ukraine would cave, but since the transition to ""phase 2"" they've been slowly but steadily grinding away at Ukrainian troops and at Ukrainian military infrastructure, and now many commentators across Ukraine and the west are suddenly realizing that Ukraine is in a hopeless situation where it can resist at great cost to itself but has no chance of winning, hence the likes of Kissinger and Macron calling for a peace settlement in which Ukrain cedes at least some of its lost territories to Russia.

&gt;If you think about effective territory controlled per size of military, Russia loses (hello Canada). If you think about ability to get what it wants without going to war, Russia loses. If you think about providing a good quality of life for a state's residents, Russia loses.

And yet, if you think about ability to direct the course of geopolitical events through whatever means necessary, not only in its own backyard but also in countries across multiple continents, which is the very definition of geopolitical strength, Russia is head and shoulders above everyone short of American and China. Are there specific areas in which it's behind? Sure. But by focusing on those specific areas while ignoring the areas in which it's strong, you're not making an accurate assessment of its strength, you're just trying to rationalize your disdain for the country.

You're also severely underestimating Russia's diplomatic strength. Russia's influence in the middle east is already argueably greater than America's at the moment, not only in Syria but even with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Do you realize what a diplomatic accomplishment it is for Russia to achieve positive working relations with not just one or two, but with all three of the major competing middle eastern states? Meanwhile America's relations with all three are rapidly deteriorating. Diplomatic efforts have also been directed towards other countries since the start of the war in Ukraine, and while not all have yet yielded results, they've been received more positively than the west's bullying attempts at diplomacy.",39d073aa542dd56e714d68ad35a8d038e15b348d,True,False,,,,,0,1654886473,,0,{},ibvxhrs,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_ibmkqlp,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/ibvxhrs/,1654886485,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654857673.0,

[],False,,mrmuscalo,,,[],,,,text,t2_14qwei,False,False,"When it comes to Western Balkans, one of the more recent developments in Russia’s soft power projection ability that gets overlooked is the growing and somewhat mysterious influence on Croatian politicians.

The Croatian president Milanovich is now being widely called out for his pro-Russian, anti-Ukranian, and when it comes to Bosnia, pro-Serb stance. He stated he’s against any NATO expansion whatsoever, while trying to block Finland and Norway accession. He said Ukrainians are to blame for the war in Ukraine. He is also aggressively fuelling separatism and ethnic divisions in Bosnia and Herzegovina by supporting the far-right Croat and Serb parties within Bosnia. Dodik, the Putin’s puppet leader of Republika Srpska, is being sanctioned by US and UK, while enjoying full support from Milanovich, who calls him “a partner and a factor of stability in Bosnia”. Dodik was also supposed to be sanctioned by the EU, but this was blocked by Hungary and Croatia. 

At the same time, the far-right Croat party in Bosnia, HDZ, has repeatedly joined the Bosnian Serb politicians in blocking attempts by Bosniaks to have Bosnia impose sanctions on Russia. The leader of the Croat HDZ party, Dragan Covich, has openly called for “more Russian influence in Bosnia” and is known to have major business interests and connections with Russians. Covich also attended the controversial 9th Jan. celebration of independence organised by Dodik in Republika Srpska, an event declared anti-constitutional by Bosnia’s courts. During this event the Serbs were celebrating convicted war criminals, among which those who committed crimes against Croats themselves. Just recently the US imposed further sanctions on Serb politicians in Bosnia, but this time sanctioning a high-ranking Croat politician as well, Marinko Chavara, for “undermining the country’s 1995 peace agreement and democratic progress”. Milanovich described these US sanctions as “terrorism” and stated Croatia must take action to defend Chavar. 

Now, the main justification for all of this is the supposed political marginalisation of Bosnian Croats by Bosniaks in FBiH, and HDZ demands for changes in election law. Namely, as per Dayton agreement, the tripartite presidency is elected by all people in Bosnia, which means all of the Bosnia’s constituent peoples get to vote for each of the Bosniak, Croatian and Serb president. I.e. the agreement doesn’t state that only Croats can vote for Croat president. Bosniaks, being the statistically majority people have helped a left-leaning politician, Zeljko Komsic, be elected among the Croat candidates, which doesn’t sit well with the far-right HDZ party and their leader Covich. Nevertheless, the presidency itself is already a semi-symbolical entity, white most of the  political power rests in other levels of government. In fact, Croats in Bosnia already hold 33% of political power, despite numbering merely some 13-15% of total population in Bosnia.

Point being, this claim of Bosnian Croats being politically endangered in Bosnia is at the very least largely overstated, if not completely ridiculous. It certainly doesn’t justify fuelling instability, blocking the country’s progress towards EU and NATO, and flat-out supporting Serb separatism and Russia itself.",5df3df867e850ed32d25523fc8083715e8de55cb,True,False,,,,,0,1654875328,,0,{},ibv75q4,False,t3_v97m5o,False,True,t3_v97m5o,/r/geopolitics/comments/v97m5o/moscow_fuels_new_conflicts/ibv75q4/,1654875346,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654846528.0,

It is a very unstable configuration since all 3 have incentive to use military force:
1. Russia is the easiest case to understand.  It’s ideology is not that attractive, reducing soft power.  It’s economy is extractive resources and grain.  What it has left is military force and the remains of empire in Eurasia.   Ukraine is a perfect example of a declining power trying to maintain status.

2.). The American alliance system was quite successful for decades.  In addition, for much of the post WW2 period it’s economy was quite strong and innovative.  American soft power was, and remains, extensive.  American FP elites understand the competition against China; there are no panda huggers left in Washington unless they are being paid by China.  The American response to China’s rise has involved several threads; a movement toward economic autarky for “strategic” industries, rejuvenation of alliance systems, military production and a shift to air/naval forces as opposed to Army.  What the Chinese have done for the Americans is to provide a focus for efforts.  Also, the Chinese Alliance/Influence system makes more explicit the linkages of trade preferences and other economic levers with strategic concessions.  No doubt the West, especially America, did the same thing under a softer cover of “building an international economy based on free choices’. 
Now America is able to go to countries in The Pacific and say “ do you want to be with us, or them?”

China is the rising power and uses a mixture of tactics from the long Chinese history of statecraft, mixed with emulation of the American multithreaded influence.  The Chinese economy is clearly a success, though it faces larger challenges than most realize.  The emphasis on heavy industry is benefitting its rapid armament in naval and air resources.  Expect 2030 to be the decisive year for Sino/US competition in the Pacific; the Chinese will have several weapon classes in serial production but the Americans will have block obsolescence before new designs can be fabricated in significant quantities.

That's all that needs to be said, really. The rest is exposition. Unless another court can get their hands on Putin, his ilk, and troops actually committing crimes (like we've seen happen to a few captured Russian soldiers), nobody will see a day in court. Even in the extremely unlikely event of a coup, whoever takes over after Putin will not hand him over. That would set a precedent and potential for that leader to be extradited if they're ousted.

""In the middle of 2021, the US and Russia had a round of private negotiations... Russia's offer was relatively high. Simply put, ex-Soviet countries should be in Russia's sphere of influence, and Eastern Europe should have a neutral status."" If the US would take the offer, then Russia could stay neutral in the US-China competition.

According to him, US partially agreed to the offer so they concocted the Ukrainian crisis since last year, trying to pressure Zelensky to abide by the Minsk Agreement, with the narrative of ""do this or Russia could invade you"", just to get Zelensky to agree without making it look like a big L for the US. Apparently, that plan got hijacked (by Jake Sullivan? Maybe due to his Russia Gate connections?) and in the end the US was somehow trying to pressure Russia with the campaign instead. This sparked Putin's invasion.

If you remember how unprepared the US and Zelensky looked at the beginning of the war, it is somewhat reasonable to assume that the invasion was a surprise, that they (the west) thought this threat is a hoax just like any day in the last 8 years, despite the barrage of propaganda on the media claiming otherwise.

Of course, I cannot guarantee the credibility of this source, all I know is this guy probably had a diploma in IR in Moscow. Unfortunately, I don't speak Russian or Ukrainian either, so I cannot verify any of it myself. Take it at your own risk.

[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"The main takeaway I get from the Donetsk bombings is that Kiev's a regime that bombs city centers for no military reason. That kind of criminal practice is why they had great difficulty keeping conscripts on the front lines in Donbas. Thjs in turn forced them to rely solely on units of ultras/nazis who were happy to kill civilians for ideological reasons. I don't think this behaviour is sound on either a strategic or a moral basis. 

Putin has made some nonsensical claims over Ukraine. I hope saner heads prevail and Russia follows through on their stated intent to hold referendums on the future of various Oblasts, and that the EU will honor such a process, similar to the Kosovo model. I suspect Transcarpathia will be as happy to be rid of Kiev as Donbas is. But most importantly, I'll be happy to see the xenocidal menace of the ultras discredited and Bandera thrown back on the dustbin. 

Russia absolutely is screwed in the short-term. I do give them more credit for starting over from zero twenty years ago. They're investing more in education and healthcare and doing a lot of the things they have to do to mature and develop. I think if EU and Russia go there separate ways, both will lose and only China will gain - and that's a systemic threat to liberalism and freedom of conscience that Russia has neither the capability nor the aspiration to become. 

I think you're right that Ukraine will prosper more by increasing their ties with the EU, but the first decade or two will be painful as it was for Poland. And sacrificing Donbas to this dream was a bargain that Kiev never should have made. Ukraine's integration should be implemented via a manner that can be hopefully used one day to bring Russia in. 

I hope we all regain our senses soon and get back on the path to mutual respect and consideration.

China is extremely stable. It takes a lot for a nation to collapse. While state communism is inefficient compared to capitalism, it's much better than the corrupt and rotting architecture it had under it's previous royalty. 

Chinese people are extremely supportive of their government outside hong kong, and with good reason. The country's rapid growth has genuinely improved lifespans, gdp per capita, access to infrastructure, education, jobs and medical care, as well as wages and the environment in many areas (with the tradeoff of pollution and CO2 emissions of course). 

Some point to their slowing population growth, but that is not actually a bad thing, but a sign of their development level.

Africa has managed to quintuple it's food production... but it's population rose to match, so many still starve. China has managed the promised ""red plenty"" - food security, something they have always struggled with and the soviet union failed to accomplish.

Now, in no way am I singing their praises. They are still far less stable than democratic nations and their economic growth level will never reach that of capitalist nations, to say nothing of social democracies.
