I fail to see how any Western politician could justify dropping existing sanctions on Russia without the situation in Ukraine shifting drastically and, from a strictly practical perspective, there is little compelling reason to do so. The only sanctioned Russian commodity that anyone really needs is energy, and now even the E.U. is starting to walk away from that. The U.S. in particular has energy security and recently even OPEC has begun (slowly) increasing supply.

That's assuming that once Russia isn't as tied down  in Ukraine, they will let peace prevail. EU has 6 million refugees, if men were allowed to leave, it woild be 12 million. You can expect that number to grow is Russia decides to destroy more infrastructure. The estimate is $600 billion right now. Does Eu want the burden?? That might be why Eu is calling for a ceasefire.

Let's assume that Russia doesn't create securoty situation that doesn't make those energy imports expensive. Russia has a lot of goodwill in Africa as it helped those countries in their wars of independence. A deteriorating security situation means expensive energy and that just screws everyone from Asia to Latin America. 

The low of minimum wage with inflation will create problems in US, Trump seized upon that. We are lucky that he was an idiot. If you get someone smart and half as evil, US and the western world is screwed.

Frankly, there are a lot of varibles. The energy and food prices need to come down yesterday. Let's not forget that a country is 4-6 consecutive meals from anarchy. Pakistan might implode soon, Sri Lanka has imploded, countries in Africa are on the brink.

[],False,,krakenchaos1,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0f2f01t,False,False,"This is one of the articles that isn't a technical about equipment or technology. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing as the study of the non technical aspects of a military is just as important, though I notice that they tend not to really get as much as attention here on reddit because they can get really dense and frankly a bit boring.

My issue with this one is that it's pretty devoid of any information, and some parts of the information that it DOES have is questionable. It starts up with perhaps the two most prosaic statements one could make about the Chinese military, firstly that it's corrupt and secondly that it has no experience. The author cites the Corruption Perceptions Index though fails to mention that Ukraine's corruption score is only 3 points off Russia's. Perhaps using a generalized corruption perception score as a proxy for military performance isn't a good idea?

The next paragraph makes some generalized claims that range from confusing to tenuous to straight up wrong; the last one is the only one that is actually somewhat accurate.

&gt;Beyond corruption, the PLA displays similar structural weaknesses to Russia’s military, such as an obsessive focus on hardware, lack of training that simulates real combat conditions, poor logistics and a persistent failure to develop joint operational capabilities.

The worst is probably:

&gt;Like the Russian military, the PLA relies on a rigid top-down command structure that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for lower-level officers and soldiers to take the initiative in combat settings.

Anyone who has done even moderate study of the history of China's military should know that this isn't true. The author seems to draw a parallel between the Soviet military to the Chinese military, presumably because the former was communist and the latter nominally still is. In reality, the history of the two have differed from the moment the latter was born, and I wonder if the author knows that for a good part of its existence, the Chinese military literally did not have ranks.

The other extremely dubious part of the article is the often repeated phrase that China has had no military experience, which is presumed to be detrimental and a weakness shared with Russia. Besides the fact that each conflict is unique in its circumstances and constantly changing, I don't really see a correlation (or a way to measure) the impact of past military experience on future military success. The far more important metric would be the ability to adapt to a constantly changing environment and situation, not to consider lessons from the past to be sacred. The US's participation in WW2 did not make it automatically successful in Korea, which in turn was a different conflict than Vietnam, which was different than the First Gulf War, and so on; the same can be said with Chechnya 1 and 2, Georgia, Syria and Ukraine (also, how can someone say that Russia has little military experience with a straight face after listing five conflicts in the same paragraph???)

It's disappointing but unsurprising that professional think tanks just publish articles like these that are basically just questionable generalizations. I do understand that not everyone cares about the boring details and that ""pop military"" content does have a place, but it should at least be somewhat accurate.",587309cd095c05b1d87cfe0e7956b6c61340cc82,True,False,,,,,0,1654905427,,0,{},ibx1pvq,False,t3_v9b3py,False,True,t3_v9b3py,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9b3py/what_the_ukraine_war_should_teach_china_the/ibx1pvq/,1654905445,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654876627.0

Joining NATO would mean the US is obligated to defend Ukraine, including in Crimea. It is a massively more escalatory and confrontational policy than a no fly zone. 

&gt;You brought up the polling.

Because it's relevant. The original question was if there was enough support for the US to credibly threaten to intervene if necessary. There clearly is already, and that is with most pundits trying to scare people away from that.

If the US decided it wanted to scare Russia off by threatening to intervene, expect support to massively increase as Biden admin officials share intelligence of Russia preparing to attack, and doing everything in their power to increase support.

&gt;But that is not phrasing it plainly. You are intentionally cutting out a part of the consequences of the action.

That's not a direct consequence, that's an assumed possible negative  outcome. The fact of the matter is, it's at least as likely Russia will back down without a shot being fired. Putin doesn't have the political capital to call up a draft, futile war with the US is going to be a hard sell.

At least one significant reason why russia wants a neutral ukraine, is because then they can take on the smaller nation, alone, without worrying about other factors getting in the way. They can play Ukraine against other nations and other nations against Ukraine.

[],False,,TheRed_Knight,,,[],,,,text,t2_isd5x,False,True,"&gt;So I've mentioned a few times now that I think Ukrainians are almost certainly suffering higher casualties than Russian (proxy and otherwise) forces in the Donbas

Thats incredibly unlikely, general rule of offensive warfare in relative peer to peer conflicts against static defensive positions leads to more casualties for the attacker IE: WWI, which is more or less what the combat most closely resembles atm

&gt;My rationale being that the Ukrainians are maintaining static defenses that are being shelled constantly by Russian forces who have both more artillery pieces and much more ammunition. Multiple articles have come out in recent weeks explaining that the fighting in Phase II is largely an artillery duel, and one in which Ukraine is massively outgunned.

Artillery is way less effective against infantry in static defense (especially trenches of which there are plenty) than youd think, again see WWI.  

&gt;Russia also has air superiority over most of the Donbas and has been utilizing quite a bit of CAS to support their forces in the region

source?  AFAIK the skies are still considered contested.  Also due to lack of PGM's+risks that creates+the shitload of MANPADS on the Ukrainian side, Id cast some doubt on the effectiveness of Russian CAS, dumb bombs arent great for that.  

&gt;I've been downvoted several times for these views, but I've yet to see any reasonable explanation for why anyone thinks that Ukraine, despite being outgunned, underequipped, and lacking ammunition, is somehow inflicting casualties on par with or even greater than the up to 200 KIA they're supposedly suffering on a daily basis.

Because 1) offensive warfare generally costs more in KIA's and WIA's in relative peer to peer conflicts than defensive warfare, 2) Russia doesnt exactly have a history of valuing its infantry lives, they treat them like fodder, and nothing ive seen in this conflict has done anything to dissuade that. 

&gt;And no, simply saying defenders tend to inflict greater casualties on the attackers is NOT a valid rationale.

Yes lets ignore thousands of years of military history because it contradicts my points

&gt; By that measure, Iraqi forces should have inflicted many tens of thousands of casualties on coalition forces in both the Gulf Wars.

Because 1) they werent relative peers, the technological advantage on the coalition side acted as such a massive force multiplier, which played a decisive role in the conflict 2) There was a 40 day complex air campaign to gain air supremacy, which made the 3 day ground campaign absurdly easy 3) in Ukraine neither side has achieved air superiority/supremacy, and the Russian air force isnt equipped or trained to maintain Western style air support, so you get pseudo WWI style combat",47093215a1c4df1092cd742b58da6bd4cdbc66cd,True,False,,,,,0,1654903354,,0,{},ibwxs65,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibwfj5i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibwxs65/,1654903368,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654874554.0

I wouldn't go so far. I've found confirmation from Lockheed that the total number of launchers delivered to the U.S. Army throughout the program amounts to [857](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/history/mlrs.html). A further 283 were produced in Europe for deliveries to Germany (148), the UK (59), France (54) and Italy (22) - source is [SIPRI's Arms Trade Registers](https://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php).

Again according to SIPRI, and **including** the aforementioned 283 produced in Europe, a total of 674 were sold outside of the U.S. Some were newly-built, such as Egypt's last batch of 12 platforms, but others came from U.S. stocks. Per Wiki, around 1,300 platforms were procured overall, so at most the U.S. today could have 626 - 225 M270A1s in active service, 160 M270A0s in storage and a balance of 241 more platforms either (1) also in storage and/or (2) scrapped.

Given how some of those platforms would have been procured in the early 1980s, and that some attrition must have been inevitable, I'd say the figure of 225 active systems and 160 more in storage must represent the overwhelming majority of current U.S. active and inactive stocks.",4e859904115ae14486757303edcd54cf2409c843,True,False,,,,,0,1654903093,,0,{},ibwx9lv,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibwrvvc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibwx9lv/,1654903109,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654874293.0

No. 

Because one is kinetic and immediate. 

&gt;In practice, these kinds of opinion polls are good for getting broad ideas about sentiment.

You brought up the polling. 

&gt;If phrased plainly, 'do you support a no fly zone', a large majority agree. If phrased 'do you support a no fly zone if it means nuclear war', support plummets. And if phrased 'in light of Russia killing American citizens and threatening to invade NATO, do you support defending ukraine', you could probably get it even higher.

But that is not phrasing it plainly. You are intentionally cutting out a part of the consequences of the action.

I know that its a quirk of phrasing, but I find it strange that “humanizing” someone involves not believing them capable of things we know that are very common human failings. It frames undesireable aspects of human nature as “unnatural”, which I think vastly complicates our ability to deal prevent these things.

Rape is not something that only weird, crazy, bad-eggs do. Its something many people do given a lack of education and oversight. If we say “only bad people are capable of it”, then naturally you’ll get pushback on any attempt to fix these problems, because it seems like you’re accusing them of being one of those bad, unnatural people.

We’re lying to ourselves if we don’t think the russian military has titanic institutional problems with sexual violence. That does not mean that automatically russians are, by dint of birth, worse than other peoples. What it does mean is that the officers, the generals, and even the civilian leadership of russia should be exorciated for their inability to control their soldiers. 

If we’re speaking of books, I think Christopher Browning’s Ordinary Men is a great example of what a “human” is capable of in the right circumstances.

For one thing, while the Ukrainians are saying they're taking heavy casualties, we're having explicitly Russian sources saying the Russians are taking heavy attrition too.  And it also makes sense in other ways - this heavy artillery advantage by the Russians has lasted for **months**.  If they were seriously taking far less differential attrition while also being outgunned 30 to 1 and fighting tanks with their bare fists, the situation in terms of land control is far more dire.

What you’re asking for here is impossible; sex crime reporting is difficult enough in peacetime, in an active warzone you are not going to catalog even a small fraction of the sexual assaults. Frankly you seem much more concerned with the perception of Russians (or perhaps by extension other slavic peoples?) and “fairness” to them rather than the actual victims of sexual violence. Let me see if I can reframe this for you.

Before we do anything else, let’s make this clear; there is ample evidence of a significant number of sexual crimes reported on by a number of people. Various people in the UN and the Red Cross both have voiced concerns about the as-yet not fully understood extent of this problem. 
 
Speaking of, as other people have pointed out to you, prior to the modern period widespread sexual violence was the expected norm, and has only really been brought under some semblence of control by professional armies, and without *constant* discipline it keeps coming back up.

And discipline in these matters is exactly what the Russian forces lack. We have seen this time and time again. The fact that sexual violence is something that people are prone to engage in does not in any way shape or form excuse Russia’s total lack of care to control it. Its clear they are barely willing to do anything about sexual assault WITHIN their military, let alone against an enemy population. The russian people should absolutely be collectively shamed for the behavior of their soldiers, which I might add is significantly substandard to the nations they like to compare themselves to.

Do you *really* think we’re going to get even close to an estimate of the true number of rapes? How much do you know about rates of reporting of sexual assault? To what degree must we account for the cultural biases that would lead victims to be unwilling to speak up? How many people were killed after they were raped, and thus are unable to report?

I see you and others latching on to the firing of the Ukrainian ombudsman as though whatever they did wrong somehow magically erases what we know to be true about ill-disciplined troops and human nature. Let’s be clear: her being bad at her job, even if that includes misreporting information, doesn’t tell us anything about the reality of situation. 

I’m aghast to think that people will see that story and somehow think that the accounts of rape survivors are made up, or that there isn’t widespread sexual violence as a result of this war. 

This has become a much longer post than I intended, but there is a shit ton more still to go over that I can’t currently structure in an intelligble way. Like how modern nations set up systems for the reporting and investigation of sexual violence that seek to bypass traditional institutional reluctances, or look at the historical data on sexual assaults in warzones in like… any war you can name, even recent ones.

To conclude:
&gt; I'd like a sober analysis from available sources.

I disagree. You want equivocation, and someone to assuage your fear and confirm your existing beliefs. You know the evidence on this is insanely hard to collect, but still feel like the absence of it is somehow conclusive.

[],False,,KarmicCamel,,,[],,,,text,t2_fjfy1,False,False,"Been seeing a lot of talk lately about ""the clock"" and which side it favors. For the sake of discussion, I've put together a few points on why I think time strongly favors Ukraine. Probably nothing shocking here to anyone, I'm more just aiming to solicit opinions and check my own impressions.

1. **Morale**  
There's the old saying about how the fox runs for its dinner while the rabbit runs for its life. It should be obvious by now that enough of Ukraine's population sees this as an existential conflict, and the same simply cannot be said for Russia no matter how hard they try to spin this from the ""West vs Russia"" angle. Putin sold this as a quick little adventure and the natural inclination of any Russian would be to compare this to the painless gains of the Crimean campaign.  
Yes, Russian support is still apparently high for the moment and the Russia state controls the narrative internally, but missing sons can't be hidden and nobody is ever happy about that. I have to think that the longer this goes on, the more foolish Putin looks and the more disgruntled the public will become. Admittedly, exactly how much that matters in Russia is debatable.
2. **Manpower**  
This is really a continuation of point 1, but Ukraine appears to have a large, highly motivated pool from which to draw upon, whereas by all appearances Russia is struggling to recoup their losses. Russians went into this not expecting mass mobilization and Russian recruiters are already having a hard time time of it, leading me to believe that conscripts would be leaving actual grooves in the pavement from their heels. Not exactly what you want in a fighting force.
3. **Supplies**  
The depth of Russia's equipment reserves is now highly debatable, whereas Ukraine is getting new toys to play with on the daily. It is reasonable to believe that Russia started with their best equipment, and we've seen that much of this was poorly maintained. Why should the stuff they have waiting in the wings be better? It also remains to be seen how the numbers on paper line up with the actual battle-ready equipment in their warehouses.  
By comparison, Ukraine is being supplied by the entire Western world with modern equipment, and the quality and quantity of supplies has *increased* throughout the duration of the war, not decreased. It would seem to me that every day of this conflict, Russia gets weaker while Ukraine gets stronger, even if in the short term Russia is making some headway in the Donbass through sheer mass.
4. **""Western Weariness""**  
I've heard a lot of talk about how the West may weary of supplying Ukraine, but why should they? The Western population at large has been sold Russia as the ""big bad"" for generations. Right now we all get to fight the good fight without even losing our own people. After all, what were all those weapons for if not to fight Russia?  
At least in the U.S., a vast majority of politicians from both parties are backing the war effort to the hilt, so they're obviously not concerned yet about their constituencies' ""weariness"". If a congressman up for re-election isn't concerned about public opinion here, why should armchair pundits be?
5. **Sanctions**  
I think this comes back to who has the existential problem. I fail to see how any Western politician could justify dropping existing sanctions on Russia without the situation in Ukraine shifting drastically and, from a strictly practical perspective, there is little compelling reason to do so. The only sanctioned Russian commodity that anyone really needs is energy, and now even the E.U. is starting to walk away from that. The U.S. in particular has energy security and recently even OPEC has begun (slowly) increasing supply.  
To put it simply, the West *wants* cheaper energy, but doesn't need it. Meanwhile, Russia *must* sell energy. OECD Europe made up about 1/2 of Russia's oil exports and 3/4 of their gas exports, and it seems like this is about to begin drying up. Tick-tock. Maybe Russia can find new markets, but nothing as convenient as Europe and it will take time to develop them. 

Possibly I'm missing something, but I just can't fathom the idea that time favors Russia here.",ac7bf0c634d9427fc6059bb3d434277dad2490fe,True,False,,,,,0,1654897851,,0,{},ibwmmvm,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t3_v965k3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibwmmvm/,1654897864,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654869051.0

Easily 2 or 3 to 1. Possibly more like 10 to 1 in certain parts of the line. In terms of ammunition, it's incomparable. Ukraine has been sounding the alarms that they're all but out of 122mm and 152mm rounds, as well as many of their MLRS munitions. 

&gt;What is the relative effectiveness of their artillery?

I'd argue Ukrainian artillery is far more accurate than the Russians, not least of which due to some of the equipment they're getting from the West. But Russia has an absurd amount of ammunition, many have argued its essentially limitless. So they can afford to be much less accurate. 

&gt;Russia not only shells Ukrainian positions, but it also attacks through open fields

Yes this is an advantage in many places. But if Ukraine is unable to exploit that advantage because of a lack of munitions, it only adds so much. 

&gt;Unless Ukraine understates its losses and vastly overstates inflicted casualties

It's a safe assumption that this is true. Ukraine clearly doesn't embellish nearly as badly as Russia does (UA estimates for RU equipment losses is about 45% of what has been visually confirmed, for RU their estimates of UA losses are only about 15% confirmed), but casualties are a lot harder to estimate.",4fd676f399753f5dcec662bfd16baf1ca533f4b7,True,False,,,,,0,1654896975,,0,{},ibwksfp,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibwhlio,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibwksfp/,1654896989,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654868175.0

Canada bought 20,000 155mm rounds for Ukraine.  
They cost $98m total. I assume this includes rounds, propellant, and fuses.  
$4,900 each.

A M795 shell is close to $400. Add in propellant and a high quality fuse you might reach $1000 each. So i'm guessing those 20,000 shells were not standard HE shells.

I found prices ranging from $1,000 to $4,500 for M549A1 shells. That sounds closer to the estimated $4,900/ea Canada paid.

Though it could be mostly M795s and a handful of Excalibers. 19,500 M795s and 500 Excalibers would add up to about $98mm. Can't be sure.

Maybe, but Russia has a LOT of advantages over Ukrainian forces currently. Anyway my point was simply that saying defenders suffer fewer casualties than attackers is not a hard and fast rule. 

I agree with you that most Russian losses occurred in the first phase of the war, when they clearly had no idea what the fuck they were doing and they couldn't defend their hugely overextended supply lines. The fighting in the Donbas eliminates those factors and makes asymmetric warfare on the part of Ukraine next to impossible due to the terrain (largely open fields) and the concentration of forces/reconnaissance.

Russia also has air superiority over most of the Donbas and has been utilizing quite a bit of CAS to support their forces in the region. 

I've been downvoted several times for these views, but I've yet to see any reasonable explanation for why anyone thinks that Ukraine, despite being outgunned, underequipped, and lacking ammunition, is somehow inflicting casualties on par with or even greater than the up to 200 KIA they're supposedly suffering on a daily basis.

We do require a submission statement with every post, so I will try to write a comment this time, and hope the OP remembers for next time.

It does appear that the author is identifying corruption, an overly rigid leadership structure, politicization of military service, and inexperience as problems in China's People's Liberation Army. And he recommends transparency to solve these issues as they would have helped Russia's military before their misadventure in Ukraine exposed their flaws. 

Another thing about transparency that the author failed to mention is that it puts other neighboring nations at ease as they can see and plan appropriately for the military threats that they face. By not being transparent and hiding your true capabilities and intent then the neighboring nations must plan for the worst. Which is why we are seeing such a massive military build up in Asia at the moment. This would also benefit China's security as the other nations would not be building up their own military capabilities and political rhetoric in response.

----------------

&gt; * One such deficiency is corruption.

&gt; * Judging by the number of senior generals arrested for corruption in China in the past decade, the rot inside the PLA may run just as deep.

&gt; * Shortly after Xi Jinping came to power in November 2012, he launched an anti-corruption drive that, by the end of 2017, had ensnared more than 100 generals. Two former vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission, which commands the PLA, were arrested for taking bribes in exchange for promotions. Another commission member died by suicide in 2017 while an investigation into his ties to the disgraced vice-chairmen was underway.

&gt; * Like the Russian military, the PLA relies on a rigid top-down command structure that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for lower-level officers and soldiers to take the initiative in combat settings.

&gt; * Another key weakness of the Russian and Chinese militaries is politicisation. In fact, heavily influenced by the culture of the Soviet Red Army, the PLA is even more politicised than today’s Russian military.

&gt; *  The PLA is under the Chinese Communist Party’s full control, and its primary mission is to defend the CCP’s political monopoly. The political commissar system created by Leon Trotsky when he established the Red Army is alive and well in China, with the appointment and promotion of PLA officers determined not only by their professional qualifications, but also by their perceived loyalty to the CCP.

&gt; * The Chinese military hasn’t fought a real battle since its disastrous border war with Vietnam in 1979. So, while it has invested massively in military modernisation since the early 1990s, the PLA’s competence and capabilities in combat remain untested.

&gt; * The only feasible step China can take to bolster the PLA is to increase transparency considerably. If more media scrutiny had been allowed in Russia, the rot in its military would have been exposed—and probably addressed—long before it started a war that it can’t win, at least not in the quick and overwhelming manner the Kremlin expected. For Xi, the lesson is that Chinese officials must shine more light on one of the country’s most secretive institutions, precisely because they are unlikely to be satisfied with what they find.

&gt;This is the only thing that anyone has said in response that actually makes some sense. But it's not really defensible as an actual reason. Having citizens fighting as mercenaries isn't much of an escalation and it's arguable that it is one at all.

The optics of US (recently former) soldiers, fighting with weapons drawn directly from the American armed forces and sent to Ukraine looks like an escalation and arguably is one. What's to stop the US from sending (just retired) pilots on F-16's (and the just retired ground crews for support). It's very similar to direct involvement such as the Soviet involvement in Korea war.

If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.

I tried to find some actual data on the issue so far and the numbers were very inconculsive, probably also due to underreporting. The wikipedia articles are pretty much useless, the numbers there are in the double digits for adults. I am willing to believe that that is too low. Kids? Very difficult to assess just by googling, but sure makes for great propaganda.

Now I understand that a lot of you guys have a deep felt hatred against the Russians and it is a great way to vent by calling all Russian soldiers that, especially after Bucha and similar, smaller mass murders. But this being CD and not one of those ""Let's all hate Russia together""-subs, I hope you can get what I am after. I'd like a sober analysis from available sources.

So my question is: what is the most reliable number so far on actual rapes and more specifically, that of children? I cannot find anything that would justify the statement that Ukraine is just being mass-raped and Russians are rapists. The whole issue seems to be frankly overblown given the number of Russian soldiers and actual rapes, which does not diminish the catastrophe of every single case though.

The first half of this formula is similar to the first part of the “Two Incompatibles,” but the second portion is a general criticism of PLA combat leadership capabilities. That same year, the “Two Big Gaps” (liǎnggè chājù hěn dà, 两个差距很大) often began to accompany the “Two Inabilities” in usage. The “Two Big Gaps” speaks of “big gaps” between the PLA’s military modernization level and the requirements for national security compared to the level of the world’s advanced militaries. It reiterates leadership concern over PLA fighting abilities in general, but compares them to other advanced militaries, highlighting the relative gap between Chinese and advanced military capabilities. One of the few instances of a Chinese-origin, English-language reference to the “Two Big Gaps” and “Two Inabilities” was published in 2016. However, it does not include the two slogans themselves and casual readers could miss the larger context and history behind this passage:  
  
Improving the army’s combat strength has become a major focus. But the modernization level of the Chinese army is inadequate to safeguard national security, and it lags far behind advanced global peers. The Chinese army is not capable enough of waging modern warfare, and officers lack command skills for modern warfare.  
  
The following year, the “Three Whethers” (sāngè néngbùnéng, 三个能不能) asked (a) whether the PLA can maintain the party’s absolute leadership, (b) whether it can fight victoriously when needed, and (c) whether commanders at all levels are competent to lead troops and command in war. This slogan adds a political dimension to concerns about the military’s operational and leadership abilities. (Other slogans, such as the “Five Excesses” (五多) and “Four Winds \[or Four Bad Styles\]” (四风), that focus on political and ideological issues, are not be addressed here.)  
  
However, the “Five Incapables \[Cannots\]” (wǔgè bùhuì, 五个不会) from 2015 is probably the most important criticism of all. It emphasizes that “some” officers cannot judge situations, understand higher authorities’ intentions, make operational decisions, deploy troops, nor deal with unexpected situations. These are the basics of combat leadership, applicable at all levels of war, for all militaries. This appraisal and the “Two Inabilities,” which also mentions leadership problems, are now the most frequently repeated slogans in the Chinese military media.",7ea3d1a14dc8e5511966e384cd57fe088cc946d0,True,False,,,,,0,1654891097,,0,{},ibw7yac,False,t3_v9b3py,False,True,t1_ibw7v0h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9b3py/what_the_ukraine_war_should_teach_china_the/ibw7yac/,1654891115,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654862297.0

""Urban warfare is the hardest type of warfare that any nation can ask its military to conduct. It is more difficult, more complex than any other—not least because urban terrain is not neutral. But to understand why these are more than just platitudes requires a detailed examination of the many particular challenges presented by dense urban terrain. That’s the focus of this episode of the Urban Warfare Project Podcast.

John Spencer highlights these challenges and describes some of the innate difficulties that military forces will encounter when operating in cities. He shares insights based on years of research and historical analysis, as well as firsthand experience with both urban operations and the institutional features of the US Army that make preparing for urban warfare even more challenging. As he explains, militaries can get better and can become more prepared to meet the challenges.

I'm not going to say to not use the Nazi word.

But a lot of Russia's behavior during this war probably has made more than a few people in some governments and definitely outside of it remember the stories they were told by their parents about what happened in WW2.

Russia insists on the stupid Denazification claim (that Putin has basically completely abandoned now), while bulldozing cities, executing civilians en masse *at least once,* for the sake of rebuilding an empire after some national humiliation (the fall of the USSR). They insist some sort of genocide is happening to ethnic Russians, that is not happening according to any reasonable assessment of the situation.

This war came off after a bunch of years of dodging around the issue, to even just not caring what happens in Ukraine.

This war is primarily being driven by a country with an ultra-nationalist state media (I can bring up some of the infamous articles they published around the war), at the head of a cult of personality around one man, after he demolished whatever was left of a barely-functioning democratic system to be an autocratic police state.

I'll admit, that I didn't treat this issue with the seriousness or attitude it deserved, until like 3 days into it. But I can only move on a little wiser.

[How Ukraine went from a corrupt army ""in ruins"" to one that amazed the world | Univision | 2022](https://www.univision.com/univision-news/world/ukraine-military-reform-us-assistance-russia-invasion)

""They've really turned it around. It’s pretty impressive,” said Col Liam Collins, who was the U.S. military’s Senior Defense Advisor to Ukraine from 2016-2018. “Ukraine had one of the largest militaries in the world in 2014, but they were terrible. They didn't train, they were horrendous,” he told Univision.

Collins, and other military experts, attribute the astonishing turn around to a “herculean effort” in barely six years by Ukrainian military leaders, coupled with millions of dollars of training and military equipment from an international group of countries, led by the United States, along with the U.K., Canada, Germany and Lithuania.

The U.S. had been conducting training exercises with Ukraine for a number of years, with names like Sea Breeze and Rapid Trident. But the intensity dramatically picked up, with up to five battalion (roughly 400-500 men each) being trained a year.

Since 2014, U.S. military advisers have trained more than 27,000 Ukrainian soldiers, U.S. officials say. Training included everything from “basic fundamentals” to the importance of camouflage and dispersion tactics and cyber operations.

It also included training for Ukrainian units at the Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany. “That's where we do our realistic, largescale training exercises replicating the rigors of combat,” said McGuire.""",9018e1de4ed5de1a022cbbdba64368e37e6b086f,True,False,,,,,0,1654882703,,0,{},ibvot26,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibvig0l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibvot26/,1654882715,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654853903.0

This is the only thing that anyone has said in response that actually makes some sense.  But it's not really defensible as an actual reason.  Having citizens fighting as mercenaries isn't much of an escalation and it's arguable that it is one at all.

Like, imagine it's the year 2000, you've got a flipphone, and somebody invades your country. What phone number do you call to get to the army and tell them about it? Do the have a call center ready to go? It's possible that you could get a report in, but it's not a clean, official channel.  

Versus now, the Ukrainian government has a feature in their official Ukrainian government app for providing authenticated-not-a-russian-spam-bot information directly to their military. That kind of infrastructure is the really important part. 

Back in year 2000 with your flipphone, maybe you know that your cousin is in the artillery regiment nearby. You give him a call, give him a report, and something useful comes of it. Completely possible! But also very rare, it's an exceptional case.
In that world, the possibility of you-the-civilian being an actual threat is negligible. Sure, there might be a couple lucky incidents across the war, but it's not something the enemy even cares to think about. 

But if you've got a streamlined system, *everyone* can do stuff like that, and it changes from being one weird story from the war to a shift combat that requires attention.

That said, it doesn't look like that infrastructure is all the way there, and we're only seeing the beginnings of that kind of shift.

The shit from ""Ukraine is fucked"" to ""Russia is fucked"" and back to ""Ukraine is actually fucked now"" has been kind of extreme lately. I want to challenge that shift with some observations and assumptions of my own:

There have been lots of claims from Zelensky and other officials about the staggering losses of the Ukrainian army. While I agree that losses are high and probably higher than that of Russian forces, I would argue that the latest comments are quite exaggerated or mentioned out of context. 

The reason I'm suspicious of these claims is because of Ukraine's continuous strategy to stay in the media cycle and keep Western support going. There has been an increasing loss of interest as time goes by and other crises emerge, and isolated fighting for villages and small cities in the East of Ukraine is just not as spicy as the headlines about Kyiv at the start of the war. Therefore, Ukraine needs to highlight the importance of Severodonetsk, the overwhelming superiority of Russian heavy weapons, and the damage that this superiority inflicts. It's simply not in Ukraine's interest to disclose these struggles so openly and repeatedly unless there is a beneficial side to it, as it directly affects the morale of the population.

""The U.S. military has devised a plan to train a platoon of Ukrainian soldiers at a time on how to use sophisticated multiple-launch rocket artillery, the Pentagon’s top general said Wednesday, raising the likelihood that more of the weapons could be sent to Ukraine.  
The plan is contingent on an initial group of Ukrainian soldiers showing proficiency on it, said Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  
We’ve got to start this thing with a program that is rational and deliberate and gets them trained to a standard where they become effective,” Milley said, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from France. “It will do no good to just throw this weapon system into the battle. You’ve got to be trained on it to get the maximum effective use out of the weapon as a precision system.  
Colin Kahl, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, left open the possibility that the United States could send additional HIMARS to Ukraine as he announced June 1 the first four systems had been approved. The United States first wants to get more information about how useful they are and how the Ukrainians are using them, he said. He predicted then that it would take about three weeks to train the first group of Ukrainian soldiers. Milley said Wednesday that it will take three or four.”

As for cell organizations, each has at least the most basic membership to perform the ops they are meant to perform. But cells are part of networks, so there is overlap between them. A cell leader for one might be in another cell too because one cell might only do IED attacks while the other focuses on terrorizing the local population to take over. A bomb maker might work with half a dozen cells. None of the cells are connected to one another in terms of knowledge or coordination beyond those few overlapping members or personal relationships.

The US needs to radically change how it evaluates weapons requests and trains the end users. First, the US should come up with a list of major weapons platforms and quantities of those platforms that are pre-approved to be sent to Ukraine. Those requests bypass the NSC all together and authority is delegated to SecDoD to approve. As for any system not on the list, the NSC should be required to forward a recommendation to the President within 7 days after receipt. 

As for training, there should be two concurrent training groups: the trainers, and the first group of end users. The US would have to increase the number of troops in Germany and Poland to make this happen, but the end result would be a unit that could go immediately into battle with the platforms, along with a group that can train new users and replacements as necessary.

[],False,,robroymacgregor,,,[],,,,text,t2_af8ah,False,False,"I think it's probably quite complicated and I suspect there are good reasons that it's taking what seems to be a long time. Some of it is probably what's been pointed out already - political considerations, uncertainty about how long the Ukrainians could hold out, etc. 

An equally big part of it, though, is that it takes time to scale out this technology across Ukraine's armed forces. These are new technologies and systems and it will take quite a while for the ZSU to absorb these new capabilities, even with the crash training programmes that they are undergoing. Furthermore, the logistics and training have to be set up *at the same time* that a war is ongoing - you can't just pull half the Ukrainian artillerists off the front line and send them to the rear to learn how to use 155mm systems. So that's one reason that it's been slower than we spectators would perhaps like.

Similarly, given the exigency of the situation in the earlier phases of the war, the US + allies clearly prioritised the delivery of the older Soviet systems which could be integrated into the ZSU with little additional training/logistical support. That made sense for the time: the Ukrainian state faced an existential threat and it needed good-enough weapons *now*, not perfect weapons later. Now that the situation is changing and it's becoming increasingly clear that Russia can't destroy the Ukrainian state in the short-to-medium term it makes sense to start delivering NATO systems to the ZSU, and to do it in a sustainable way, to ensure it can use them effectively in the long run. If I'm right in this, then expect to see the Ukrainians improve their position over the next few months as the NATO-standard equipment comes online in greater and greater numbers. The price of this, of course, is that many Ukrainian troops will die in the near term under the barrels of Russian artillery in the East. But that, I'm afraid, is how war works from a government perspective: people make cold calculations about costs and benefits, and the price is always human lives. 

TL;DR: A decision has clearly been made to deliver the weapons in a steady flow rather than all at once, recognising that a) it takes time to bed down new capabilities in any armed force, even one fighting as the Ukrainians currently are and b) existential pressure is off Ukraine, meaning that they *can* do things in more measured fashion.",b76abdfaf4e5f93e6c0710ef4065a6630e1f3124,True,False,,,,,0,1654866991,,0,{},ibuof2l,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibujhz7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibuof2l/,1654867005,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654838191.0

&gt;One thing I am not seeing, probably because it is not a highlight, is funding for readiness.

To my knowledge, that is the most significant thing in the additional funds. So it is the main highlight actually, it is just that a few more F-35s sound coolers to the general public and general journalists. It also says so at the top of the military-wide plans. Significantly more money to make increase ammunition and supply stocks, improving the support structure around the soldier, etc. The earlier funds (as you can see in the graph it has gone up the past years as well, but only a bit) mostly focused on building capacity like that up again, as those were the things really pulling the organization down. As an example, some years ago there was often a lack of ammunition for training, so they had to shout shooting sounds when shooting during some training.

* The readiness and deployability of personnel and materiel will be improved.
* Ammunition, medical supplies, fuel, food, spare parts, and other deployment stocks are being replenished and increased at an accelerated rate in order to be able to act more quickly and for longer periods if necessary.

In regard to the *for but not with*,  that has exactly been the case in the Dutch Navy. The ships were made with additional VLS capacity in mind, later they were adapted with BMD in mind. But what was missing is a missile to put in the unused cells. They wanted to buy Tomahawks 2 decades ago, but didn't do it. Now they made the funds available for that. They wanted to by a ballistic missile interceptor like the SM-3 for years now as the ships are finally BMD capable, with only missing the shooter capability, but didn't have the funds for it. Now they do. So we might be finally able to outfit the ships with what we wanted. 

But the ships were also made to hold 2 goalkeepers, but onle 1 ship has 2, not sure if they all will be getting their second goalkeeper, as they have been modernizing all of them (to eventually all be replaced by a SeaRAM like system). They are all getting their new 127mm cannon, they are getting the new SMART-L M/M radar and APAR Block 2 radar, I also see funds for additional EW systems, something each ship has a mounting point for, but rarely carry (likely because they don't have enough), maybe now they can. And they will be getting the replacement of the Harpoons, ESSM (ESSM Block 2), and the replacement of the current SM-2 used. Some of these things might be carried over to the replacement of these LCF ships, as they are near the end of its lifespan (in a decade), but we will see.

My understanding is that men of fighting age have largely been kept in the country giving Ukraine a potential pool of manpower measured in the millions. To make these men useful they must be trained, equipped and assigned to units. Equipping them is possibly the easiest part ( my understanding is that Ukraine has received significant small arms, weapons, helmets and body armour in its aid packages) but the other parts are complex.

The British Army takes 24 weeks to train someone from street to Infantry Soldier, other arms have different lead times. This time can be reduced if necessary (there's a lot of drill that can be cut out!) but I suspect you still want at least 16 weeks. However, you need trainers and you need resources to conduct this training and I suspect these are in very limited supply. My assumption would be that training output would be a trickle at the moment although this will ramp up as the months go on.

As for forming new units, you cannot make a unit from new recruits only, you need NCOs, Officers and people with experience. The process I would imagine is that experienced soldiers from the front line will be rotated out and placed into the CoC of new units, again, this is a slow process, you can't just pull everyone off the front line especially when Ukraine is under so much pressure.

So, in my mind, there will be a trickle of new recruits backfilling existing units on the front line, as this trickle builds up into a stream and the situation on the front line stabilises experienced soldiers from the front will be pulled back and new units will be established and become available to deploy.

Neither concessions nor unrealistic dreams of toppling Putin can secure lasting peace

By Patrick Porter / 9 June, 2022

[https://thecritic.co.uk/how-to-end-the-war-in-ukraine/](https://thecritic.co.uk/how-to-end-the-war-in-ukraine/) 

Wars end either through brute force or negotiation. Vladimir Putin’s attempt at brute force, his inept, rapacious lunge into Ukraine, has met strong resistance. But though Ukraine, aided by western arms, intelligence, sanctions and supply, thwarted the initial onslaught, the fighting and Russia’s atrocities continue with no clear end in sight. Russia is now seizing incremental gains, attempting to apply more concentrated and overwhelming force. Thus far, neither the aggressor nor the defenders have been strong enough to prevail.   
  
This deadlock calls forth rival western visions of how the war should end. Ukraine’s war aims are its decision, but the west is deeply involved and should decide what war aims it will support. There remains sharp disagreement about how to end it, and what’s at stake.  
  
Recently, western observers have offered two seductive visions of how the war ought to end. The doyen of realpolitik, Henry Kissinger, urges Ukraine to trade land for peace. As he argues, Kyiv ought to return to the status quo before February 2022, and possibly cede the contested Donbas territories, to buy off Russia’s invasion, lest the crisis worsens and Russia is driven permanently into the arms of Beijing.  
  
By contrast, “maximalists” such as Anne Applebaum and Eliot Cohen call for victory without compromise. Only the decisive defeat of Putin’s regime, followed by Ukraine joining Nato, will effectively end the war and deter another one. Cohen draws hope from the history of underdogs repelling larger invaders, whether Israel against the Arab coalition in 1948, or Vietnam against France and the United States.   
  
Applebaum goes further, calling for the humiliation of Russia, followed by revolution. To extinguish the threat of imperial conquest from the East, she says, Russia’s flight should be followed by a benign uprising in Moscow and a reckoning with its historic wrongdoing.  
  
Both visions offer emotional satisfaction. Inspired by the memory of his artful diplomacy in brokering the compromise peace that ended the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Kissinger’s formula promises what many westerners want, cutting a deal to purchase an escape from a dangerous impasse. Applebaum and Cohen offer the noble prospect of a righteous military victory through moral courage and endurance.   
  
Both, however, are flawed. Neither land for peace, nor mere coercion will move the crisis from where it is to where it should be. 

The maximalist position rests upon ideal, best-case expectations, mistaking wishes for facts. It presumes much of Ukraine’s capacity for successful protracted war, when Ukraine too is depleted. It underestimates the resilience even of beleaguered states when they are fighting for first-order interests. Russia’s concern for its interests in Ukraine is more intense than France’s towards Vietnam, or the Arab League’s towards Palestine. Using war and sanctions to break a state’s will is hard, as the smaller nations Iran, Cuba and North Korea have shown.  
  
Moreover, if a maximalist strategy were to begin succeeding, an emboldened Kyiv might enlarge its war aims to include the expulsion of Russia from Crimea, risking making a ruthless, nuclear-armed enemy desperate. Enlarged war aims, such as the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, will further incentivise Russia to fight on. It’s possible, of course, that a maximalist war would make Russia’s bloodied forces collapse. It might even ignite a benign coup in Moscow, with its citizens agreeing under coercion to repudiate the country’s great power ambitions and their imperial past. But none of that is a plan.  
  
As for Kissinger’s plan, it would raise the risks of the conflict re-igniting later. Ceding territory and people to Russia would be too much of a gain for Putin, allowing Moscow to believe aggressive war worked. It would provide a land platform for further predation. The purpose should not just be to get Russia out, but keep it out. And most Ukrainians oppose the further dismemberment of their country. The Donbas for them is not the expendable Sinai to Israel. To succeed, any war-ending settlement must carry opinion on all sides.  
  
Short of one side suddenly collapsing, there is no military or diplomatic trump card that will swiftly resolve the struggle. The more plausible path is politically painful. Ukraine with western help must inflict battlefield coercion on Russia. This is partly to deter Moscow trying invasion again, making whatever gains it pockets too expensive. And there needs to be further fighting to force Russia to further reduce its war aims. Then, if the parties wish to avoid a dead-end stalemate, they will have to compromise over Ukraine’s place in the European security order, addressing the dispute which precipitated the war in the first place.   
  
So the fighting should facilitate meaningful talking. After all, the Zelenskyy government, too, states that there will have to eventually be negotiation to terminate the conflict. Russia must abandon its bid to make Ukraine a supplicant client state. Ukraine and the west will be best served by the country adopting fortified neutrality, accepting Russia’s earlier theft of Crimea as harsh reality (or postponing the question), and preparing for détente with a post-Putin Russia.

**Kharkiv Frontline:** There was no change on the ground in Kharkiv Oblast.

**Siverskyi Donets Frontline:**

 Russian army have begun to build fortifications in the vicinity of Izium amid the fears of Ukrainian counterattack towards the city.  

Ukrainian troops repulsed enemy attacks on Bohorodychne and Dovhenke, north of Slovyansk. 

Ukrainian forces have retreated from Svyatohirsk and most likely from Studenok as well over the night. Russian troops entered Svyatohirsk and captured the town.

Russian sources claim that Russian troops crossed Siversky Donets near Svyatohirsk and captured Tetyanivka. This is however unconfirmed and there is no visual proof.

**Lysychansk &amp; Sievierodonetsk Frontline:**

Fighting continues in Sievierodonetsk. The situation in the city is very fluid and changes every hour.

Ukrainian defenders repelled attacks on Toshkivka and Ustynivka. The enemy retreated to its original positions.

Russian troops attacked Ukrainian positions at Berestove, but weren’t successful.

Russian forces entered the western outskirts of Komyshuvakha, putting Ukrainian troops at Zolote under more pressure.

[],False,,sebalnesag,,,[],,,,text,t2_19zx3hiv,False,False,"&gt; Experts questioning the capabilities of Russian aerial forces and their utter failure in achieving dominance of the skies against the extensive Ukrainian air defense network seem to miss a larger possible implication, that the kind of widespread shock and awe bombing strategy that is central to the concept of modern warfare may not be economically or operationally feasible anymore.

Russia and ukraine are not rich enough to get a gamechanger air force, and as a result, they turn to artillery.

But lets imagine the US enters the war, the air force coupled with the intel gathering the us have with the unblinking eyes would criple any russian force rather quickly.

One of the pillar of offensive aviation is the destruction of the radars that guide sam sites. if the us doesnt have secret new tactics, this relies on missiles that lock on the radiation emited by radars, and they have pilots, the wild weasels, who are trained specifically for that, with customs jets and modules made for evading missiles and striking radars.

It seems that russia doesnt have an equivalent doctrine or training.
more over, i have heard reports of US intelligence allowing the ukrainian radars to turn on ( wich makes them vulnerable as they become visible to radiation seeker missiles ) only when russian jets arrive in firing range, giving the sams a chance to strike first and forcing the jets to get defensive.

finally, what are the russian intel gathering capacities?
do they have a network of spy satellites, radars, awacs, that work in concert with their air force to guide munitions? do they even have enough precision missiles/bombs? it seems that russian air force is a costly relic of the past, the same way the moskva was, a money pit in maintenance and totally innefective, but a way for a pridefull nation to pretend that they are a super power.",af39ae896681adf57c07e7cb700b8326ddbe8ef1,True,False,,,,,0,1654852473,,0,{},ibu3a25,False,t3_v5j3dg,False,True,t3_v5j3dg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v5j3dg/does_the_russoukrainian_war_reiterate_the_vital/ibu3a25/,1654852487,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654823673.0

[],False,,Clerofax,,,[],,,,text,t2_xqfxm,False,False,"We are now at the 106 day mark since Russia began its invasion of #Ukraine. Today, an examination of the options for Russia when, or if, it captures #Severodonetsk and the remainder of the Luhansk region. 1/22  
  
2/ The past month has seen the Russian military consolidate its forces into fewer fronts, and concentrate much of its offensive power in the east. At the same time, it has continued strategic operations to strike targets across Ukraine.  
  
3/ This approach has delivered more tactical success, relative to its initial assaults on Kyiv and Kharkiv in their initial phases of the invasion. Their battlefield success has been particularly obvious with their gains in Luhansk. 

4/ Currently, Russian forces fighting in Severodonetsk have fixed Ukrainian forces in a pocket, with Russian forces also advancing from Popasna in the south and Lyman in the north.  
  
 5/ The obvious Russian operational objective here is to capture the remaining Ukrainian held territory in Luhansk, and also capture/destroy Ukrainian ground forces that might be enveloped in the Severodonetsk pocket. 

6/ If the worst (for Ukraine) occurs, and Russia captures Severodonetsk and the remainder of Luhansk, what might be the next move by Russia? 

7/ First, Russia would leverage such a victory for its strategic influence campaign. It would communicate this as a victory to its domestic audience to demonstrate progress for the costs incurred. 

8/ Russia would probably seek to use a ‘victory in Luhansk’ message globally to show that the tide of the war had turned, and that ‘supporting Ukraine is only delaying the inevitable’. 

9/ Militarily, there are a couple of options for Russia after a victory in Luhansk. First, it might assume a defensive posture to rest, resupply and regenerate forces in the east. This, however, risks wasting the tactical momentum they have created in that region.  
  
10/ Second, the Russians may elect to continue advancing to then secure Donetsk. This is not an insignificant task however. It is a larger piece of territory than the remainder of Luhansk which is the current focus. 

11/ And Ukraine retains significant combat forces in the Donbas, which are starting to receive increased numbers of Western artillery systems, to resist a continued Russian advance.  
Image  
  
 12/ Third, the Russians are under pressure in the south. In Kherson, the Ukrainians are continuing to chip away at territory seized by Russia earlier in the war. Russian positions north of the Dnipro are under particular pressure.  
Image

13/ In the wake of any Luhansk success, Russia may have to pause in the east so that it can reinforce its defensive positions in the south. The challenge in the south is magnified for the Russians by the nascent Ukrainian resistance movement in the region.  
  
14/ Fourth, we should continue to watch the north and north east of Ukraine for Russian operations. Russia has options around Kharkiv to conduct ground operations to fix Ukrainian forces there so they can’t reinforce the south or east.  
  
15/ At the same time, there are forces in Belarus that could undertake limited operations in northern Ukraine. While unlikely, it is still a contingency that the Ukrainian high command cannot take its eye off.  
  
16/ The reality at the moment however is that both sides are weary, and are sustaining heavy casualties. The Ukrainian President has stated in the past 24 hours that Ukraine is losing over 100 KIA per day.   


17/ Therefore, we might expect an operational pause (not a ceasefire and not a stalemate) at some time in the coming weeks. The Ukrainians and the Russians will need time to rebuild, retrain and re-strategize if the Russians are successful in Luhansk.   


18/ In every long war, a tempo is established of constant maneuvering and preparations, punctuated by short periods of vicious combat. A Russian victory in Luhansk might end the first major pulse of combat in this war. 

  
19/ While it appears that tactical momentum is with the Russians, they still have issues with regeneration of their combat forces. They have tactical and operational choices available, but all have attendant logistic, air support and other challenges.   


20/ We should have no expectation of a quick end to this war. While both sides are tiring, they both retain the will, the means and the political objectives to continue the fight over the long term.   
21/ Given all this, strategic patience from those supporting #Ukraine is essential. As Eliot Cohen has recently written, “the moment calls for intestinal fortitude, standing by the government and people of Ukraine.” End.",f7f16cff4e878d27794bb5b2d7e38b4d6e66fed5,True,False,,,,,0,1654842436,,0,{},ibtrrnv,False,t3_v8f8u1,False,True,t3_v8f8u1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v8f8u1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_09_2022/ibtrrnv/,1654842453,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654813636.0

\#4 - I suggested the same theory recently but for all of Donbas - if they capture it, their main strategic goals will be completed and they will sue for peace, then we'll hear things like: ""Fortunately the Russians agreed to stop the war, I will do everything to make it happen, how could I want more war?!"" from certain Western leaders. But SD can not be the point where Russians can do it, ""liberate Donbas"" is their main declared goal, stopping the war before capturing Slovyansk/Kramatorsk will be EXTREMELY unpopular domestically, there is a limit to how much Putin can spin things. Without Lysychansk, even the Luhansk oblast won't be completely ""liberated"", technically. Furthermore, it will be harder to convince anyone in the West that this is anything more than an operational pause.

So I don't think SD has a real strategic value for Ukraine at this point, they're just stalling for time just like anywhere else in Donbas as they hope that time works for them.

Okay...how do I explain this...

Gildeer has said things I'd be perfectly to find, cite, and link, as examples where he exhibits a pro-Russian stance...to the point I'd almost consider it a very disingenuous response to a question someone was asking, and I'm sure others with long memories could cite *even more such cases.*

In question, it was about what war crimes were happening, that was clearly about what Russia might be doing, and he insisted on posting the videos of Ukrainian soldiers shooting POWs. 

It wasn't a good look. I kindly explained to him what the problem with that assertion was.

We tolerate him because he does actually seem to have a viewpoint that isn't about mercilessly shilling everything the Russians do to the point of such perceptions as ""it was just a feint bro, lol.""

As in, whatever it is he believes that is causing it, it probably isn't a position of outright *malice.* 

And yes...he has posted things *from the Russians* that are unflattering *about the Russians.* (Some Russian millbloggers, multiple seemingly, have called the separatists better experienced than the peacetime army, which while that makes sense, Russia is basically using these people to carry their offensives...they...shouldn't really be at that point).

So, I don't understand his thing. But I'm not gonna call him a Russian bot every time he posts.

Now, for Duncan-M.

...He has done *absolutely none of this.* And I cannot remember anything he said that resembles Gildeer's spicier moments. And if I could, I would be happy to mention them.

So...I'd just appreciate it if you could mention, specifically, what he has said, even just on one occasion, that has you behaving like this.

&gt;The scheme of maneuver for the Russians from the beginning was to conduct a concentric encirlement to cut off the salient in two

No shit, which has shrunk by the month due to the Russian military limitations

&gt;The Russians saw much more success doing a broad front attack, which is why they historically like doing them, and in this campaign we see why they work sometimes: when they outnumber the defenders, especially in fires.

Yes the Russians finally started following their doctrine after trying and failing to emulate Western doctrine in the opening phases of the conflict, but without consistent air cover theyre more or less fighting like a WWI bite and hold army

&gt;And that brings us to map three which roughly brings us to where we are now. Namely, Severodonetsk, which has seen fighting since Day 1 back in mid April, still hasn't lost? Why? Because the Russians never wanted is that much. Look at the map, count the BTGs, they never had enough there to clear that city, and that wasn't an accident. If they wanted the city, they'd have massed more BTGs to take it. They didn't, so they didn't.

Thats one helluva logical leap, its entirely possible they were unable to mass the number of BTG's they wanted for a variety of reasons (morale, combat effectiveness, logistical issues, etc), and frankly the Russians havent demonstrated enough competency to be given the benefit of the doubt here

&gt;Why are they stubbornly refusing to evacuate ground that are already effectively lost (and destroyed), who holding them endangers 10-15,000 UAF troops from the very real threat of encirclement, instead of taking less casualties performing an elastic defense, allowing tactical retreats, trading space for lives and willing to give up the salient that holds no real strategic value at all, inflicting the roughly same amount of casualties on the Russians while at least halving their own, shortening their lines in the process as they fall back, etc?

When have the Russians succeeded in encircling any UA forces outside of Mariupol?  Theyve constantly threatened it but failed utterly in actualization.  The Ukrainians are almost certainly inflicting more casualties than theyre taking, thats the nature of offensive warfare into prepared defenses of relative peers where neither side has air superiority/supremacy (a comical failure on the Russians part)

&gt;I found that very odd. They already lost 20% of their country, a single extra city or two wont be that big of a deal to retake in the grander scheme. And they're going to be conducting scores of river crossings, worrying about one or two extra crossing of the Donets (from the easier west to east avenue of approach) is hardly a good reason to take such prohibitive losses they shouldn't this early in what can be a long war.

Shockingly certain geographic locations are considered more important than others, whod have thought?  According to the Ukrainians they value Sievierodonetsk more than us armchiar commentators, perhaps its important to their prohibitive offensive plans?  or perhaps they see a good opportunity to bleed the Russians dry while UaF reinforcements arrive?  

Also worth pointing out the UaF has access to way better intelligence than us civs do, and for the most part have made the ""right"" moves in this conflict

&gt;If so, then then their entire strategy really does no longer amount to saving lives, it amounts purely to save ground. They can afford to destroy their 2022 military if it means no more ground lost that their 2023+ army, larger, stronger, and better equipped, won't be able to retake because the war will have be over already.

The weight of the Ukrainian force seems to be (largely) the same across the three pictures. Although a few of the Ukraine...""groups"" (I don't know what Ukraine refers to them as) seem to have been replaced as it went on? This makes the defense of this pocket more impressive in that it would mean the force concentration at any given moment for Ukraine hasn't substantially changed (i.e, they did not increase the number of defenders in this area proportional to Russia's increases, 

I don't imagine that they didn't suffer losses and have to rotate in replacements, but still. I had a different impression of the Ukrainian force concentration over time in that area. 

Could it be that they're defending the pocket simply because they believe that the force concentration they have can defend against the Russians despite their increasing pressure on it? If the 100-200 dead claim is overall spread out across all the fronts, and the Donbass is not noticeably higher in casualties (which with the concentrated firepower in the area would be impressive, but the Mariupol defenders managed to hang on for quite long, so maybe it's not entirely shocking), it could be that that's why they're still holding on. That it's actually...truly just a better situation in the Donbass than we think.

It is possible that Ukraine believes NATO may band together to start suggesting peace terms unfavorable to them (territorially) compared to before February 24th. The question then is, if this is their assumption, how true is it that NATO would start seriously pressuring Ukraine to accept conceding (roughly) the territorial gains Russia has made? 

It would be weird for NATO to seriously start making this proposal, because Ukraine's government, their people, and *a lot of other people in other governments and in other countries* would probably respond: ""Uhhh, hand over land to the barbarians from Russia? Are you mad"" Because regardless of whether the Russian Army *should* have that reputation, they *do* have that reputation.

One thing I am not seeing, probably because it is not a highlight, is funding for *readiness*. Which is to say the fuel, ammunition, and supplies to rigorously train the military as much as the man hours that are available. Too often this part of the budget is neglected as it not as interesting or as visible to outsiders, and it makes for an easy target when looking for savings in the defense budget. I was watching a video on the British Army in WWI and one of the reasons cited for their effectiveness was the increased ammunition fired per soldier in training, in compared to other militaries of the era: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8jitGtA1x4

Another thing that has been a popular way to cut the defense budget is build ships for capabilities, but not with the weapons that would give them those capabilities. Commonly referred to as *for but not with* the Tomahawks listed in your write up would seem to indicate that this issue is understood and that measures are being taken to address it.

Although it is easy to cheer or chastise the increases and decreases that respond to world events, I hope that as citizens become better educated on defense issues they come to realize that a proper and efficient defense posture takes long term planning and steady commitment.

So when you want to talk about why the UAF are still fighting over that one city the salient is named after, you must talk about everything. 

Maps of the salient:

[April 16, right after the Russian offensive began](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQrk3nEXwAYQ5zM?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096)

The scheme of maneuver for the Russians from the beginning was to conduct a concentric encirlement to cut off the salient in two, with the Izyum being the primary northern focal point and along with a larger broad front focal point on the southern side with the main effort placed on Popansa, along with with a supporting attack at Severodonestk, which seems to have only been designed to act as a holding attack to keep UAF forces in place so they couldn't reinforce the flanks. 

However, the Ukraine flanks were much too strongly defended for either pincer axis to make progress. Especially, the northern axis, which started having forces shifted away following Gerasimov's visit, which I think was to approve a shift in the original plan (if the MOD approved the original plan they likely weren't allowed to change anything without his approval)  away from a single massed assault from the Izyum axis , which made little progress, to a broader front attack that included the entire northern side of the salient, with an emphasis on Lyman. The southern axis remained broad front, and Popasna  still was the main effort apparently, but that took brute force and lots of fires to finally break the defenses and force a retreat when the UAF defending Popasna literally ran out of standing buildings to defend from. 

The Russians saw much more success doing a broad front attack, which is why they historically like doing them, and in this campaign we see why they work sometimes: when they outnumber the defenders, especially in fires. 

And that brings us to map three which roughly brings us to where we are now. Namely,  Severodonetsk, which has seen fighting since Day 1 back in mid April, still hasn't lost? Why? Because the Russians never wanted is that much. Look at the map, count the BTGs, they never had enough there to clear that city, and that wasn't an accident. If they wanted the city, they'd have massed more BTGs to take it. They didn't, so they didn't. 

Now if we shift away from the Russians and focus on the Ukrainians, based on all three maps and any other you can find, as well as any daily/weekly OSINT battle updates, is there any ground in the entire salient the UAF gave up unless it was absolutely impossible to continue holding it? Nope. Which means as their operational scheme was to perform hold the line, not to give up any ground unless there was no other choice. This was no defense in depth, no skillful elastic defense, this was a static slaughterfest that compares to certain historic defensive battles where such phrases were coined: ""Hold at all costs,"" ""Not a step back"", or ""They shall not pass."" Those types of battles are extremely bloody for the attacker but the defender as well. But that's okay, but when those types of orders are given, ground is more important than blood. 

Hence why the UAF are still fighting in Severodonetsk. Why should they? After all, they haven't been entirely pushed out yet. If the Russians did mass the troops needed to push them out, they'd only move back just as far as the Russians pushed them, regardless of the losses. 

If you want to find an answer to good question, try to find out why the Ukraine General Staff following that policy. 

Why are they stubbornly refusing to evacuate ground that are already effectively lost (and destroyed), who holding them endangers 10-15,000 UAF troops from the very real threat of encirclement, instead of taking less casualties performing an elastic defense, allowing tactical retreats, trading space for lives and willing to give up the salient that holds no real strategic value at all, inflicting the roughly same amount of casualties on the Russians while at least halving their own, shortening their lines in the process as they fall back, etc? 

I found that very odd. They already lost 20% of their country, a single extra city or two wont be that big of a deal to retake in the grander scheme. And they're going to be conducting scores of river crossings, worrying about one or two extra crossing of the Donets (from the easier west to east avenue of approach) is hardly a good reason to take such prohibitive losses they shouldn't this early in what can be a long war. 

But what if they don't think this will be a long war? What if Zelensky and the general staff don't think this war will go long enough for them to retake those areas with counteroffensives?

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"Some interesting details on the effectiveness of training military units, and the possible future reforms of the Russian military. Kofman has said that the Southern Military district is the best in the Russian military and the training program of its leader could be one of the reasons why. 

If the Russians had been able to muddle through the conflict and able to accomplish its goals, then I would imagine the leadership would have been satisfied with a mediocre performance. But the many clear failures of the Russian military have been so dramatic and irrefutable that there will surely be major attempts at reform. What happens with these reforms and what the Russian military looks like in a few years will be fascinating to see. 

--------------

&gt; * As late as 2017, the Russian Ground Forces were experimenting with systemic training reforms to correct perceived field training deficiencies in order to improve combat training. 

&gt; * Dvornikov’s push for competitive force-on-force training in the field appears to deviate significantly from the Russian standard of training. In general, Russians view gunnery and live-fire exercises as the highest form of combat training. This is very different to US and NATO militaries, which held similar views until the 1980s, when competitive force-on-force training, employing means such as the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), and Observer, Coach, Trainers (OC/Ts) were adopted.  

&gt; * Eventually, competitive force-on-force training came to be regarded as the highest form of combat training for these militaries. Russians do see value in training against a thinking adversary, but this adversary is usually fought in a simulator, as opposed to in the field, and this training is only seen as supplementing gunnery and live-fire exercises. 

&gt; * Russian military leaders likely believe, like their Western counterparts, that there is no better training than actually doing the activity one is training to do. However, since this is not practical for combined arms warfare, fighting against a thinking adversary in a training environment is of great value. While the US and NATO have opted for force-on-force training to achieve this end, Russia appears to have chosen simulation.

&gt; * Although it is not possible at this time to determine if Dvornikov’s efforts to introduce competitive force-on-force training to units in the Southern Military District have borne any fruit, these units have fared better than those of other military districts. It is currently impossible to determine if these results are due to better training, or simply because the Southern Military District reportedly has some of the best-equipped units and operates in more favourable terrain. 

&gt; * Instead of just relying on gunnery, live-fire and simulations, he wants to incorporate force-on-force competitive exercises with freedom of friendly and enemy manoeuvre, and adjudication and training assets such as MILES and OC/Ts to impose honesty and, therefore, a higher level of training.

[],False,,TheRed_Knight,,,[],,,,text,t2_isd5x,False,True,"RE why the Ukrainian are handshaking a battle of attrition with the Russian at Sievierodonetsk imo

1. The UaF doesnt have great options for offensive warfare, they lack the armor+air power necessary to launch offensives, and dont have much training in that aree either, since theyre modernization post 2014 were aimed at creating a stout defensive fighting force to counter further Russian aggressive.  Pulling more Russian forces into Severodonetsk weakens the Russian flanks, allowing UaF forces launch limited offensive, particularly in the South/Southeast, to retake Ukrainian land and put more pressure on the Russians

2.  The Ukrainians want to break the Russian army, once again since they lack the forces/training to launch offensive warfare easily, they dont have many options, considering how the Kiev+Kharkiv offensives fell apart into routes, drawing the Russian into a battle of attrition, grinding down their forces until they break is one of the few options left, especially considering the Ukrainians have reserves that will likely be finished training soon, they have reinforcements incoming and Russians dont really.  

3. If the UaF loses Sievierodonetsk, its going to be very difficult for them to launch offensives to retake Luhansk oblast, its too strategically important while simultaneously being virtually undefendable.  

4. As soon as Russia secures Sievierodonetsk i expect them to declare ""victory"", halt offensive warfare, and dig in.  Its going to be much harder for Ukraine to get Western heavy weapons if the Russians arent launching offensive warfare in Ukraine anymore,.

Oh and whatever casualties Ukraines taking in Sievierodonetsk, you conservatively assume the Russian are losing around 1.5 that number",756b27646ba37bdbd391d02f700ebae9f47a58a4,True,False,,,,,0,1654828595,,0,{},ibt5txi,False,t3_v8f8u1,False,True,t3_v8f8u1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v8f8u1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_09_2022/ibt5txi/,1654828613,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654799795.0

·        Russian forces continued to fight for the Azot industrial zone in Severodonetsk under the cover of heavy artillery fire.  
  
·        Russian forces made marginal gains north of Slovyansk but are likely to face difficulties assaulting the city itself because of the tactical challenges posed by crossing the Siverskyi Donets River.  
  
·        Russian forces made incremental advances to the east of Bakhmut and will continue efforts to cut Ukrainian lines of communication to the northeast of Bakhmut.  
  
·        Russian forces are likely engaged in limited fighting along occupied frontiers in northern Kharkiv Oblast.
