Everyone, because in all their opinions, even the idea that Ukrainians are another people who have chosen a different path is not allowed by them. They do not recognize the independence of Ukraine and the difference between Ukrainians and Russians. So yes. I believe that the vast majority of Russians are in favor of occupation. Even with good intentions, their ""kindness"" ends where Ukrainians have chosen independence. That is why statements against the war are not credible.  
2. I generalized the UN as the same working chat where everyone sits just to block other people's decisions. Statements and evidence are brought to the UN by everyone. It is possible to condemn, but all that the UN gives is ""concern"". Currently, 1.6 billion people are suffering from the war in Ukraine. What is the UN doing? And this is only now. Ukraine has been at war for 8 years and Ukraine has appealed to the UN 11 times. The Russian veto broke everything. And so yes, I think the UN is not working. And the task is just that. In the prevention of wars. But let's count how many wars have already happened in front of the UN? And how many times the peacekeepers poisoned. The UN is good only on paper, but in reality it needs reforms or dissolution. And it is simply necessary to expel Russia from the Security Council. Nobody invited them there at all.  
3. I understand what you are saying. See the history of the Mujahideen. And how Afghanistan lived before the arrival of the Communists. These are people whose women and children were taken away. And their children in Pakistan became the Taliban, which means students. In their place, when everything human was taken away from them, it cannot be said that they voluntarily refused to do so. Therefore, the United States supported them. And all because of what I agree with.

Those soldiers were caught by the ""independent"" ""sovereign"" ""Donetsk republic"", and as far as I know this ""republic"" didn't sign the Genova treaty.

Other point, Russia cannot be held responsible of the actions of another ""sovereign country"" so they won't feel any blame regarding this.

3rd point, if the UK or Morocco (which is my country) start negotiating with that ""republic"" it's an admission  of its existence, and I don't think the UK will start any negotiation regarding those soldiers.

Extra point, while y'all are discussing if those soldiers are mercs or not, what matters is how the law of the ""Republic of Donetsk"" sees them, and if the law there considers them as mercs, they'll be judged as mercs.

That's why, ladies and gents, war is ugly. When you enlist and go to the battlefield with your weapons, you should be aware of the risks you're taking. If you're going to a war that is not your country's then don't expect your country to stand by your side.
