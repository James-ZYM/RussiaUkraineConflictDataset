*New Evidence Shows How Russian Soldiers Executed Men in Bucha*

Witness testimony and videos obtained by The New York Times show how Russian paratroopers executed at least eight Ukrainian men in a Kyiv suburb on March 4, a potential war crime.

Russian forces are intensifying operations to advance north and west of Popasna in preparation for an offensive toward Severodonetsk.  
Russian and proxy authorities in Mariupol are struggling to establish coherent administrative control of the city.  
Russian forces reportedly attempted to regain control of the settlements they lost during the Ukrainian counteroffensive north of Kharkiv City.  
Russian forces are bolstering their naval presence around Snake Island to fortify their grouping on the island.  


**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely complete their withdrawal from the vicinity of Kharkiv City but attempt to hold a line west of Vovchansk to defend their GLOCs from Belgorod to Izyum.  It is unclear if they will succeed.  
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.",1f83a516b4c0f67232652924f18a2803ee8f1331,True,False,,,,,0,1653003378,,0,{},i99iqo7,False,t3_ut1tmt,False,True,t3_ut1tmt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut1tmt/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_19_2022/i99iqo7/,1653003395,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652974578.0,

First, there is the point about not defending Taiwan from a war they started. This same point could be used to argue against any alliance with the Baltics. After all, what if one of them just randomly decides to invade Russia one day.

Second, there is the question of the Kinmen islands, and what we would do if China attacked them, since they are indefensible. We had the same issue with West Berlin during the Cold War, and that didn't stop NATO from existing. We can either place a tripwire force on the islands, or explicitly exclude them from the defended area.

Third, there is the worry that a formal defense pact would deter Taiwan from increasing their defense spending. I think the oppose is the case, lower than hoped for defense spending from Taiwan could stem from a sense of hopelessness. Either the US comes to save them, or they are thrown to the wolves on a hopeless fight against the CCP. At no point does their own army make a difference. A formal defense agreement would completely change that.

Their population went from being the largest in Western Europe in the early 1800s to being dwarfed by Germany in WW1 and exceptionally so by WW2. Something like 40 million to 60 million in 1914, and 40 million to nearly 80 million in 1939. Add to this the fact that France could not simply put all its troops in a single place as a defender, they were compelled for political reasons to defend the low countries and against Italy which did eventually join, there was no parity at all. And viewed through a certain lens, yes France's military had some material advantages, but in practical terms it was making due with far smaller resources than Germany. The tanks were famously stronger and more numerous but the preponderance of their development happened much earlier, and so they did not benefit as much from the rapidly advancing doctrines and technology of the period (larger crews, more concentrated firepower, mobility, divisional structure). And while you could say that more stagnant command structures demonstrates exactly the opposite of what I am saying, I feel this is wrong on two points:

1) It vastly oversells the initiative of the Nazi command, which would be better categorized as internally hostile mini fiefdoms vying for power and prone to self-serving gambles. The well known flexibility of german troops at the squad level, and the prussian emphasis on staff planning do not square up with an overall structure of initiative. In the telling and retelling of the German Blitzkrieg, this myth has taken on outsize proportion. The critical juncture in the French German campaign was by all accounts a rash gamble at the top that happened more by accident than anything, and would have resulted in spectacular failure had it not gone perfectly, something which could not have been predicted beforehand. I don't think that good leadership in a war is merely making wild bets, and even more so I think it is a mark of failure when the tank corps, and the airforce, and the army, and the interior production ministries are all at war, trying risky schemes to increase their own prestige. 

2) It mistakes bad luck for a bad plan on the French part. France fought bitterly in WW1 against tremendous odds, but the war still resulted in far far more damage to France than Germany. It's already small population had further an extremely demoralized and diminished fighting cadre. The decision to focus more on static defenses in the Maginot line etc is easy to criticize because it didn't work, but it very nearly did. Had the French been able to extend its defensive works further west, and not had their hands tied by their allies, the Blitzkrieg could very easily have been obliterated in a battle similar to Kursk 1943. Their plan and the command they put in place to carry it out, while static both physically and structurally, was probably the best thing they could have done in the circumstances. No strategy or choice is inherently better than all others, it is the circumstances which make them good or bad, and under the circumstances I think fairly France was a victim of bad luck.",ccab7d6c6a9046f0d0f0e2a953c9e46c3264fc2e,True,False,,,,,0,1652999944,,0,{},i99buym,False,t3_usqpal,False,True,t1_i9698jc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usqpal/when_strongmen_invade_they_bring_their/i99buym/,1652999957,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652971144.0,

Furthermore, the Philippines government delayed key U.S. security cooperation programs that would have enhanced allied deterrence posture vis-à-vis China. Given how Beijing’s 2012 aggression undermined the U.S.-Philippines alliance in Manila, if Washington were to adopt strategic clarity for Taiwan, Beijing might be incentivized to attempt a similar gambit with Taipei by seizing one of its outlying islands.

A second condition of strategic clarity would be a “no Taiwan independence” clause, wherein a U.S. pledge “to come to Taiwan’s aid [would not be] unconditional and would not necessarily cover a crisis initiated by Taipei,” as Haass and Sacks write. But the assignment of blame for initiating a conflict is in the eye of the beholder. Such a caveat would be welcomed by Beijing, which argues that all its coercive measures are in response to provocations by Taipei and Washington. In Beijing’s view, Washington threatens China’s sovereignty by encouraging Taiwan along its steady march toward independence.

With Ukraine, Chinese officials and media adopted Russia’s narrative that the United States is to blame for having broken a purported promise to not expand NATO eastward. In this reading, Putin was forced to invade Ukraine to block NATO from reaching Russia’s doorstep. Beijing also claims that Washington is acting equally as dangerously in the Indo-Pacific—so presumably Xi will be compelled to prevent Taiwanese independence.

Considering Taipei’s assertions that Taiwan is “an independent country already,” a conditional U.S. promise to intervene would only provide fodder for China’s global propaganda organs, casting the United States as again reneging on a commitment not to interfere in China’s internal affairs. In practice, the “no independence” condition removes clarity from strategic clarity and enhances China’s propaganda narratives.

Like most Americans, many Taiwanese people naively assume that the U.S. military can save them from subjugation. In truth, however, Taiwan’s inherent capacity to resist an invasion until partners can come to its aid is likely a decisive factor in mounting a successful defense, and therefore in deterring an attack in the first place.

According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), “Taiwan faces significant challenges from decades of underinvestment in defense.” In 2020, Taiwan spent just under 2 percent of its GDP on its military, while many other so-called front-line democracies, including South Korea, India, the Baltic states, Poland, and Israel, all spent more than 2 percent. While Taiwan’s defense budget has inched upward in recent years, a U.S. security guarantee would be counterproductive to overall military deterrence, because it would reduce pressure on the Taiwanese government to further increase defense spending, marginalizing effective capability enhancements such as additional defensive munitions and drones.

Lastly, the argument for strategic clarity is premised on the notion that China currently believes the United States will not intervene militarily to defend Taiwan. While Beijing’s propaganda denigrates Washington’s commitment to the region, there is scant evidence that China’s leaders actually believe it. The Chinese Communist Party’s internal doctrine frames the United States as China’s greatest threat, and China’s military likewise assumes U.S. intervention in its planning. In China, U.S. President Joe Biden’s invocations of a commitment to defend Taiwan are viewed as intentional signaling, not as unscripted commentary. As the USCC concluded, “The perceived lack of clarity … may be less relevant to deterrence failure than other factors … given that Chinese leaders already assume U.S. intervention.”

The instinct to provide a security guarantee to Taiwan arises from deeply held American values. But U.S. adversaries hold different values and are swayed by alternative propositions. Beijing would likely exploit a declaration of strategic clarity and seek to create divisions between Washington and Taipei.

From China’s point of view, a decision to invade Taiwan would not be tied to a U.S. security guarantee—Beijing already assumes that Washington will intervene. To enhance military deterrence, Washington must advance credible U.S., Taiwanese, and allied defense postures and capabilities. To increase economic and political deterrence, the United States must demonstrate willingness to hold China accountable and build coalitions to do the same. Given the high stakes, Washington must lead from the front without delay to effectively deter cross-strait aggression.",db16a8a2838c4a68d928af7ff96eaccb4970c73d,True,False,,,,,0,1652998809,,0,{},i999hh7,False,t3_utdgmr,False,True,t1_i999gx7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utdgmr/taiwan_doesnt_need_a_formal_us_security_guarantee/i999hh7/,1652998823,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652970009.0,
[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"In September 2020, Richard Haass and David Sacks reignited a debate over providing a formal U.S. security guarantee to Taiwan, ending decades of strategic ambiguity regarding U.S. intentions. They reiterated their support for “strategic clarity”—“to make explicit to China that the United States would respond to an attack against Taiwan with … severe economic sanctions and military force”—in late 2021, two months before Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine.

Following the invasion, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe argued, “The time has come for the U.S. to make clear that it will defend Taiwan against any attempted Chinese invasion.” Similarly citing the Russia-Ukraine war example, Eric Edelman and Franklin Miller lobbied for “a clearly stated U.S. commitment to vigorously defend Taiwan against efforts to forcibly incorporate it into the [People’s Republic of China].”

In addition to a formal defense commitment, the authors variously recommended companion actions necessary to enhance U.S. credibility. But existing U.S. law already provides the policy direction to implement these additional actions. And it is these additional actions—not a new policy proclamation—that would deter Beijing by demonstrating U.S. resolve rather than just talking about it.

In practice, a U.S. security guarantee is likely to reduce rather than enhance deterrence, as the conditionalities in such a declaration, by circumscribing geographic and political limits, would invite China to exploit those very seams, challenging U.S. credibility. Furthermore, a U.S. commitment would likely stall much-needed defense reforms in Taiwan, while having no real impact on Beijing’s invasion calculus.

From an adversary’s perspective, the breadth and depth of U.S. security cooperation are perhaps the most powerful demonstration of American commitment—more so than any mere declaration of intent. As with Ukraine, the United States compelled Taiwan to give up its nuclear weapons program decades ago. Also, as with Ukraine, the United States restricts the weapons it offers to Taiwan. In hindsight, U.S. failure to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine following the 2014 Russian incursions and twice again in 2021—all intended as de-escalatory olive branches extended to Russia—had the opposite effect on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given the imbalance of military power across the Taiwan Strait, historical U.S. resistance to offering Taiwan security assistance out of consideration for Beijing has been equally unjustified and counterproductive.

Strategic clarity, however, would not solve this problem. Current U.S. law already provides ample guidance. The Taiwan Relations Act establishes U.S. policy “to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force … that would jeopardize the security” of Taiwan. On the question of security assistance, the statute requires the U.S. government to “make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services” as needed for its self-protection. Prioritizing the U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation relationship is simply a matter of U.S. political will and bureaucratic implementation.

Similarly, the U.S. president’s statutory obligations to respond to an attack are arguably already commensurate with, and in some ways stronger than, the U.S. mutual defense treaties with the Philippines and Japan, both of which are targets of China’s maritime military coercion. The latter documents obligate the United States to consider an attack on the counterpart to be “dangerous to its own peace and safety” and to “act to meet the common danger.” (This same language was used in the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan, which the United States abrogated in 1980.)

The Taiwan Relations Act, by contrast, sets a lower bar to initiate action by directing the president to consult Congress on a response to “any threat [emphasis added] to the security or the social or economic system of” Taiwan. Compared with a defense pact, the president can invoke the act earlier in a crisis—possibly even today.

Haass and Sacks argue that strategic clarity should be accompanied by increased counter-China defense resources and enhanced diplomacy to signal severe economic and political costs in response to aggression. But the U.S. Defense Department has been focused on China as its top long-term priority since early 2018, and the recent implementation of U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia has instructed Beijing more than diplomacy ever could.

To build on this credibility, the United States must demonstrate willingness to sanction and restrict entities in China whenever appropriate—even at a cost to shorter-term U.S. economic interests. For their part, Edelman and Miller go further, suggesting that the United States deploy forces to Taiwan to train the Taiwanese military. Given revelations that U.S. force rotations to Taiwan already exist, though, no new policy declaration is needed to publicize or expand these programs.

ANALYSIS | BONNY LIN, JOHN CULVER
Putin’s trampling of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s evisceration of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong indicate both leaders respect hard power, not words on paper. It is concrete actions—increased military resources to counter China, demonstrated willingness to enact sanctions, and deployments of U.S. forces in Taiwan—that have and will impact Beijing’s perceptions of U.S. capability and resolve. Such actions can be taken without a U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan.

Conversely, a declaration of strategic clarity could instead be counterproductive. A U.S. security guarantee would necessarily come with two caveats or conditions. The first relates to geographic scope. The Taiwan Relations Act (like the mutual defense treaty that preceded it) covers the main island and the nearby Penghu islets, leaving out Taiwan’s outer islands, which include offshore islands along China’s coast and South China Sea features.

With very little warning, the Chinese military could annex one or more of these isles in a matter of hours—presenting a fait accompli before the United States could respond. And with China’s unparalleled anti-access defenses, not even the U.S. Marines would attempt to reclaim islands within China’s coastal territories. Therefore, a U.S. security guarantee cannot credibly include these outlying islands.

But even if they are not covered under a defense pact, by annexing them Beijing would diminish U.S. credibility and sow division in Taiwan, just as it has in the Philippines, a longtime U.S. treaty ally.

Ten years ago, Beijing ran such a playbook in the South China Sea, leveraging its superior maritime power. China’s armed vessels escalated a jurisdictional fishing dispute at the Philippines-controlled Scarborough Shoal, which China also claims and which is technically not covered by the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Washington stepped in to mediate, but Beijing reportedly reneged on an agreement for both claimants to withdraw. Following the Philippines’ withdrawal, the United States did not challenge China’s remaining vessels, effectively ceding control of the shoal to China.",d93327f812ec9e060f3ff478e094426bfb8ac25a,True,False,,,,,0,1652998802,,0,{},i999gx7,False,t3_utdgmr,False,True,t1_i992d7e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utdgmr/taiwan_doesnt_need_a_formal_us_security_guarantee/i999gx7/,1652998815,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652970002.0,

The reality is that oil production is just too diverse at this point for countries such as India and China to worry about. Throw in the sanctions softening on Venezuela, Biden potentially meeting MBS, and some of these countries are going to gamble with oil. Military equipment, though, is non-negotiable.

A month into it and everyone realized Kyiv would likely stand, but then the Russians retreated signaling the defeat of their initial strategic goal to conquer Ukraine.

After that everyone was waiting for the big Donbas offensive to start, that was a guarantee. It was just a matter of how big it was going to be. Some thought they might try to drive from Kharkiv to link up with a southern pincer cutting off the entire JFO. Instead it was an attempt to reduce the Severodonetsk salient from Izyum to Popasna. 

The Izyum drive failed so miserably they shortened the encirclement to a pincer from Lyman and again to Bilohorivka, the latter failed terribly. 

The southern pincer can only come from Popasna, where they've been grinding away for over a month and finally achieved a ""breakthrough"" that still only gains them a southern advance and not a northern. They'll almost certainly not be able to do anything more than cause a UA retreat from the Donets river defensive line, so UA loses a few cities while Russia just lost its last offensive capability for the next year, along with however much damage they'd done to themselves to achieve this.

This isn't cause for breaking out the champagne but now isn't the time to be pessimistic either. We're seeing the culmination of Russian military non nuclear capabilities in real time, when they lose the initiative and go on the defensive not because they chose to but because they have no alternative. This is literally the turning point of this war.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's difficult for me right now to answer questions of 'What's new on the frontlines?'. Almost everywhere on the frontlines there are battles. Somewhere positional, elsewhere - offensive, and more often than not - defensive. In general, everywhere except for Donetsk and Kharkiv the frontline is stable. Both us and Ukrainians are entrenching. And... THIS IS VERY BAD! Why? Because, if a month or month and half ago the enemy only had mobile defence in Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Ryh directions, now they are actively building fortified positions at the frontlines and in their near rears, which we will then need to be capturing FOR A LONG TIME AND WITH HUGE LOSSES. Just like Mariupol, Popasna, Izyum, Rubizhne and Severodonetsk. We will again need to wage fierce bloody fights for each village, every grove and every high-rise... pay with Russian blood for every few hundred meters conquered. And there will be no one to 'question' about it - 'this all happened naturally, as it was meant', which is certainly not true.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the start of the operation the RF AF actually demonstrated highly manoeuvrable actions, deep strategic breakthroughs for tens and even hundreds of kilometers. They ended with 'nothing' for reasons I've already described and called out many times. (Initially, a completely inaccurate evaluation of operational situation, which was used as a basis for combat planning, and linked to this evaluation a severe lack of resources and means to hold on and control the conquered territory). Nevertheless, despite the resulting shocking 'half-failure' (in the South, no 'run to the border' has happened) of the first stage of the operation - it appeared much more lively (compared to the 'Second Concrete') than the bloody 'push-pull' which the hostilities have become since end of April and until now. Simply because in the first stage, there was no conscious purposeful and even 'famed in advance' by 'near-military' 'experts' sticking of the army into a STRATEGIC DEADLOCK. The military decisions were courageous and aimed at achieving a decisive victory.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now however, even the TOTAL success (which is not expected in the near future) of the second stage, at best, will lead to costly (in terms of personnel and vehicle losses), fairly small territorial gains, achieved by PUSHING OUT the enemy from Donbas territory.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let's imagine for a second, that in the next few weeks the enemy will be after all defeated through continuous frontal and flank attacks, and completely pushed out of LDPR borders. And? What will this achieve? Will this end the war? No, not at all. At best - it will reduce the frontline, not more. Let's say the enemy suffers heavy losses (they do now). But in those weeks they will be able (thanks to continuing mobilisation) to prepare new fresh reserves. Moreover, they already have these reserves! The enemy is so confident in the strategic stability of their frontline (abandoning 1-2 localities in 2-3 days has no effect on this) that they continue keeping a relatively large group at the border of Transnistria, and even created a new (several army BTGs) at the border with Belarus. And they continue forming new units and detachments both in deep rear, and also in Sumy and Chernihiv Oblasts given up by Russian forces during the 'run to the border'.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, when the weakened in heavy fights and bloody assaults troops reach the borders of LDPR, they will be met by fresh and well-equipped UAF units at frontiers prepared for defence in advance. And even if those fresh units for whatever reason decide not to take over the initiative and begin a counter-offensive (one or more) - still the Russian Federation will face a perspective of a long positional war, which is nearly fatal (in current conditions) to our economy, social and socio-political situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I'll be honest - receiving quite a lot of messages 'from the field' from soldiers, junior and middle commanders, enough to create an approximate 'mosaic' of the general situation on the frontlines, I personally have no significant hopes that the objective of fully clearing the Donbas will be complete by at least mid-June. Moreover, I presume (with high level of probability) that it will not be completed until the very point when UAF will try to overtake the strategic initiative by beginning the planned (right this moment) offensive operations. And yes - the most dangerous direction I believe is Kherson, since that's exactly where (and the enemy KNOWS IT VERY WELL) defending are the same in terms of equipment and training elements of DPR reservists, which (just those were from Luhansk) the enemy has ALREADY pushed out to the Russian border in Kharkiv Oblast. At the same time, the Donetsk militia will undoubtedly put up a fight. And the fight will be fierce. But their weaponry and equipment 'leave much to be desired' just like their leadership, if not less (although, I've probably said 'too much').  
&gt;  
&gt;But, let's say the enemy for whatever reason decided to not attack, and will limit to sitting on the newly created defensive positions (offering our generals to continue 'smashing their soldier's foreheads against numerous fortresses'). What will the High Command do in this case?  
&gt;  
&gt;After all, without breaking through the newly created and occupied by large enemy forces positions there will be no defeat of UAF. And without defeating UAF there will be no final victory - regardless of how many 'Kalibr's you launch at rear facilities, they still won't be enough to fully paralyse the Ukrainian transport network and destroy the economy 'to the ground'. Especially it's meaningless to hope for victory through attrition taking into account that almost all of Europe and North America are acting as a rear for UAF. Thus, it will be necessary to try and defeat the enemy in field battles. And, excuse me, with whom, and with what?! If so far not even the partial mobilisation has been carried out?!  
&gt;  
&gt;No one is giving clear answers to these questions. Simply because there aren't any. While the pests in the president's entourage will be assuring him that:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Everything is fine, beautiful marquise A little more and our triumph Don't stress, don't look for surprises Our love and honours are waiting!""  
&gt;  
&gt;\- nothing will change. And when it does change (unfortunately, the 'surprises' are likely to be no less discouraging than before the 'run to the border') it will be too late to do anything...  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime ... In the meantime - in general terms:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- South of Izyum, units of the RF Armed Forces and LDPR are still ""bashing head-on"" against the Ukrainian defences on the approaches to the Sloviansk-Barvenkovo ​​highway and to Sloviansk itself (in the last couple of days there is no information about progress);  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Heavy battles with a slow advance are taking place north of Popasna and south of Lisichansk (there is no discussion of any “cauldron” for the enemy in this area yet - so far only a possible “bag” with a very wide “neck” is appearing, which our fighters will still need to “tie up”, and the enemy is well aware of this - the UAF are not led by morons, but by specialists from NATO);  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Also slowly, our troops are ""encircling"" the city of Lyman (Krasnyi Lyman) and trying to break through to Svyatogorsk;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Near Donetsk, fierce attacks continue northeast of Avdiivka and southwest of Horlivka, in the area south of Maryinka, I have no information about the progress in the last 24 hours (so far, at least).  
&gt;  
&gt;In Maruipol, the final surrender of Azovstal by the enemy and the capture of the group defending it is a major propaganda success, but - in the overall picture - it is a delayed consequence of the relative success of the FIRST stage of the operation, and not the ""Second Concrete"" one. In real time and from a military point of view, this is also, unfortunately, a purely tactical success. No more.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a general conclusion: our successes are still exclusively tactical in nature. The enemy is trying to keep ALL large settlements important in military and informational-propagandist sense. And - apparently - has enough strength and reserves to hope for success in this. If not complete success, then at least partial. The ""attrition battle"" (as I have repeatedly noted - as a military decision, I rate it no higher than ""idiotic"") in the Donbas continues and the ""strategic impasse"" (for the RF Armed Forces, but not for the UAF, who are gaining time) is getting deeper.

The purpose of UA counter-attacking in that location, which the Russians valued so little they left three weak BTGs to cover a ~50 km frontage, was as a spoiling attack, forcing the Russians to divert resources and energy to respond to the UA versus being used proactively for what they wanted to do, whatever that might be.

In military parlance, being able to do what you want versus what the enemy wants means possessing the initiative. If you don't possess the initiative, you're constantly forced to react to the enemy instead of being proactive. That's why no military ever wants to remain on the defensive, it's too reactionary, you can't achieve any operational or strategic goals if you exist just trying not to lose. And it's why the best defenses are active defenses, which involve every possible way to steal back the initiative by doing things like spoiling attacks and every other thing to sabotage the enemy plan. 

By forcing the Russians to counterattack NE of Kharkiv to secure their supply lines they had to dramatically reinforce that region, they either diverted forces meant to be used in the Donbas, or else they were staged in their operational reserve in Belgorod being reconstituted after being mauled earlier in the war somewhere else in Ukraine. 

A big focus in maneuver warfare is to try to get the enemy to commit all their reserves ASAP, as nothing decisive can happen if they have forces available to commit to deal with new emergencies. Once everything the enemy possesses is ""on the board"" and committed, that's when operational breakthroughs can be achieved and exploited, where massive battles of annihilation can occur, etc.",79431fdcbc36ac40d2f1daf2d8554575d8eb3dad,True,False,,,,,0,1652994350,,0,{},i98zryu,False,t3_ut1tmt,False,True,t1_i98ndrw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut1tmt/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_19_2022/i98zryu/,1652994364,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652965550.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Towed guns are totally vulnerable to any type of fire, everyone in the crew and the ammo itself are all exposed at all times. While firing, the crew have to dig nearby slit trenches for protection and hope they can reach them if they're targeted with arty or air attacks, and even if that allows them to survive their equipment and vehicles will likely be damaged/destroyed. The only thing that might work in their favor in this conflict is Russian fires incompetence or lack priority in counterbattery, plus UA crew training and skill (if they're very good they can fire and be moving in under three minutes). 

Self propelled arty are tracked AFV, so require a hell of a lot more maintenance and spare parts than a towed gun and it's prime mover (usually something like a Humvee). However, being armored they'll shrug off arty frag that would smoke a towed gun crew. 

Typically towed guns are used by motorized and airborne/air assault infantry, whereas self propelled guns are used by tank or mech infantry type units. This type of war favors the latter, especially on the offensive, because this is mechanized maneuver warfare where artillery reigns as king of battle. It's given that name because it'll kill way more combatants than any other weapon system, and that's been true throughout the 20th century and apparently still true today.

In fact, the whole point of APCs and IFV is because of artillery threat, dismounted infantry that come under concentrated artillery fire are doomed, nothing destroys units as effectively as artillery and it's so much more responsive and accurate now than in the past. APC are basically battle taxies, they exist to give the infantry the ability to move to the attack point while protected from arty fragmentation, at which point the infantry dismount to attack and APCs typically cover them with HMG fire. IFV, possessing a turret, cannon, and tank-like fire control, allow the infantry to conduct attacks while still mounted or dismount with organic IFV support that accompanies each squad, supporting each other. When it comes to artillery heavy warfare, the idea is to dismount as little as possible. Not only are dismounts very easy to kill/wound, they're also very slow compared to vehicle speed. So infantry try to stay mounted (especially if on the offensive and not in constrictive terrain). 

Besides the infantry, the artillery tries to do the same. Stay mounted, stay protected, stay mobile. Stick and move, whether they're on the offensive or defensive, they don't want to remain static nor rely on sheer luck if they are targeted.

Tube arty are exposed when setting up, operating, and taking down their guns. M777 usually uses wheeled prime movers (vehicles that tow the gun). The type of arty that is meant for this sort of war are self propelled arty, fully enclosed tracked vehicles with armor rated against small arms and artillery fragmentation/blast, that are quicker to pick up, move, and emplace than tube arty (SPA specialize in shoot and scoot fire missions), and have better tactical mobility off-roading because they're tracked. The issue with them is they're way more complicated to operate, they require much more training for crews and mechanics, they're more expensive so there are fewer of them made, and those that are fielded are less likely to be given away by NATO countries versus towed guns. For instance, the US Marines just downsized their active duty cannon artillery of M777 from 21 batteries to 7. Which was likely why the US gave Ukraine the M777.

The Ukranian version of events at the recent river crossing was:

1. Ukrainians became aware Russians were massing on the other side of the river, allowing Ukrainians to scout to find the ideal crossing point and pre-target it with artillery.  (re: river crossing doctrine, this would be the loss of tempo)
2. Russians smoked the crossing as per doctrine, but Ukranian scouts were able to hear the sound of motor-boats assisting in the bridge construction and confirm that they were crossing.
3. Ukranian artillery destroyed the bridge, cutting off some units which had already crossed. Artillery and aircraft bombing then destroyed units on both sides of the river.

Arguably the only difference from Russian doctrine here was that they delayed on the initial crossing, giving the Ukrainians time to scout and predict the crossing point. It's possible that had they arrived and started their bridging operation all in one day, they would have been able to establish the bridge and cross a fair number of troops under smoke cover, with the bridge not being destroyed until some time later on.

It seems likely that with satellites, drones, and precision standoff weapons, no single bridge crossing can survive very long and that any units that cross should expect to be  cut off quickly. They could mitigate this by having more bridging equipment, allowing them to cross at more locations, and dismantling bridges and moving them before they are bombed.",7fd8064d66a9f4f016bc5c986341ab733d040bf9,True,False,,,,,0,1652988075,,0,{},i98md86,False,t3_ut7hcd,False,True,t1_i97za74,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut7hcd/russian_deliberate_river_crossings_choreographing/i98md86/,1652988092,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652959275.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;That's kind of the point I was making - the reason (or one of the reasons, I should say) none of the Northern front ended up being annexable is because unlike the Southern front basically every hardpoint and large population center put up a fight, so all they had gained are some unsecured supply lines and rural/suburban area around urban centers.

I think there were more factors than insecure supply lines and holdouts in their rear. That entire front was ""a bridge too far,"" they didn't have the forces to take Kyiv without bleeding the rest of the war effort dry of manpower and supplies. But what's the point in even doing that if strategically taking Kyiv changes nothing? It's value was only as the center of Ukraine govt and commerce when they thought their regime change goal was attainable, but based on the first month that was clearly not the case. So either reinforce a failed strategic goal. Or abandon it, allowing them to mass resources on strategic goals that were at least attainable, annexing at least part of Ukraine that was capable of being annexed.

&gt;The Russian strategy in the southern front wasn't that different - the difference was few hardpoints put up any resistance, so they managed to have total control over both urban centers and the land around them, and now have solid control of a sizeable strip of land, to this date the majority of their strategic/political gains in the war

There was lots of resistance against Southern MD advance, just nothing successful until they got further inland. For instance, they took Kherson oblast and Kherson itself but that wasn't their strategic goal, it's pretty clear now that they were intending to continue on through Mykolaiv and onwards to Odessa, possibly in conjunction with an amphibious assault judging by how much of the MP was still uncommitted at that point and aboard ships. 

Heading eastwards from Crimea they ran into resistance outside of Mariupol, which eventually retreated while in pursuit into that city, a campaign ongoing nearly three months later. 

Since the start the SMD has had to retreat as well, they pulled back from Mykolaiv nearly all the way back to Kherson. They also never could move north to capture Zaporizhia or Dnipro, both of those were strategic argets too. 

I think the only real success the SMD had over EMD or WMD was that first battle to break out of Crimea. It seems the UAF actually tried and failed to stop them on the border there. I'd love to learn what happened there but so far nobody's talking. Another one of those things we're going to have to wait for until actual knowledgeable insiders in Ukraine start talking to journalists, and whoever gets that scoop has at least one book deal they can turn that into.",b74f9f10077bb1fc6cd12ee4d05403daf4674495,True,False,,,,,0,1652988019,,0,{},i98m7zg,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i97zh8t,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i98m7zg/,1652988031,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652959219.0,

The comparison is so out of proportion, it hurts.

So far, there were less casualties in this war, both armies added together plus Ukrainian civilians, than there were both civilian and military casualties even in side theaters like Greece, Bulgaria or Albania.

I find the constant WW2 reference for a lot of reasons super problematic, because it gives people who have not studied WW2 (admittedly not this sub though) the wrong idea about the sheer scale of WW2. And it relativizes the Shoah which makes the German war effort unique.

If you want to compare this war to something, here are some ideas far more similar in terms of both casualties and reasons:

- Poland vs USSR, 1919
- Armenia vs Turkey, 1920
- France vs Syria, 1920
- Turkey vs Greece, 1919-1922
- Italy vs Ethiopia, 1936
- Manchurian War, 1931
- Indonesia vs Netherlands, 1945-1949
- France vs Vietnam, 1946-1954
- France vs Algeria, 1954-1962
- Portuguese Colonial Wars, 1961-1974

He literally talks about rear echelon stealing bf all the gifts posted to them they rummage through and take everything good and then leave them scraps.

He talks about officers staying in a basement and sending small groups to attack entrenched position kms away.

He talks about from too down there is corruption like everyone reports “ all enemy positions were suppressed” but only 20% of the targets were hit, then of course the infrabtry gets slaughtered on the attack.

He basically speaks of it like suicide.

Says even FSB were just somewhat understanding how ridiculous it was and trying to coax them with promises of more payment.

Funnily enough rather than FSB actually executing their own men despite threats it was regular soldiers that killed their own men.

He actually proudly states that they assumed some of their soldiers being led away would have been “tortured by the banderas” so they struck them all with an ATGM as it is “better that way”.

&gt;Look at the Kyiv front, a 120 km plus thrust from west of the Dnieper and it reached the western outskirts of Kyiv in a day. The eastern pincer was a little slower but that was only because major cities had to be bypassed because the UA had enough forces present to resist. Same with Kharkiv, it was reached in hours but the Russian lead elements trying a coup de main were repelled. The fact is that nearly everywhere the Russians encountered resistance it halted them, except for the Crimean Isthmus of Perekop, where UA defenders were overrun/routed, though we still have no clue what happened there.

That's kind of the point I was making - the reason none of the Northern front ended up being annexable is because unlike the Southern front basically every hardpoint put up a fight, so all they had gained are some unsecured supply lines and rural/suburban area around urban centers.

The Russian strategy in the southern front wasn't that different - the difference was few hardpoints put up any resistance, so they managed to have total control over both urban centers and the land around them, and now have solid control of a sizeable strip of land, to this date the majority of their strategic/political gains in the war.

We do know however, that the Russian military has thought about these types of operations a lot and has them extensively written up in their doctrine. By looking at their doctrine, the importance of such operations, and their difficulties we will gain a much greater understanding of current events and how to interpret them. 

------------------

&gt; * The Russian army is primarily a regional force, intended for employment in Eurasia; consequently, its equipment is designed specifically for that envi- ronment, which includes large expanses of woodlands and tundra intersected by broad rivers and massive swamps. 

&gt; * In central and eastern Europe, an advancing or withdrawing force can expect to encounter a 6-meter-wide water obstacle every 20 kilometers, up to a 100-meter-wide water obstacle every 35–60 kilometers, a 100- to 300-meter- wide water obstacle every 100–150 kilometers, and a water obstacle more than 300 meters wide every 250–300 kilome- ters.2 

&gt; * Russians prefer to cross water obstacles from the march to avoid any major halts and massing of forces within enemy artillery range. Crossings are attempted at multiple points along a broad front in order to overwhelm enemy defenses and maintain tempo. The crossings are preferably conducted at night; however, this is difficult (and, in the case of tank snorkeling, forbidden). Particulate smoke and electronic masking are used extensively to cover assault crossings, particularly those conducted during daylight hours. 

&gt; * Should a Russian attack be stopped at the edge of the water, the deliberate crossing may be conducted by those stalled forces that are in contact or, preferably, by a follow-on force attacking from the march through the stalled Russian force (since tempo is easier to maintain than to ini- tiate). Artillery support is essential for a deliberate crossing. Where possible, artillery is moved forward, where direct fire and low-trajectory fire can be provided.7 

&gt; * A 210-meter-long PMM-2M bridge was constructed under fire across the Euphrates River in Syria in 2017. The bridge remained in position until February 2018, when it was dismantled by spring flooding.9 

The steps in conducting a deliberate river crossing are— 
Step 1. Destroy the defending enemy, which is facing the water obstacle. 
Step 2. Approach the water obstacle, and seize the cross- ing or far bridgehead by air assault and/or vehicle fording attack. 
Step 3. Cross the main body using table of organization and equipment (TO&amp;E) systems, and develop the offensive on the far shore. 
Step 4. In the event that the offensive begins on the near shore, cross under cover of artillery and aviation support to break through the enemy defenses and develop the offensive into the depth and flanks of the enemy.10 

&gt; * The main ground force advance is usually led by a bat- talion size advance guard, with a mission of rapidly cross- ing the obstacle and developing the beachhead for the main body. The force often resorts to reconnaissance by battle in order to determine the parameters and strength of the enemy defense.12 

&gt; * It normally takes a half hour to ferry a tank battalion across a medium-size river. 

&gt; * A well- trained engineer company can span a 268-meter river in less than an hour. 

&gt; * Crossing a wide river under broad daylight is risky, and it is best not to ferry across until a large bridgehead has been established. Bridges are vulnerable and demand intensive air defense artillery coverage and effective counterbattery fire. Ferry crossings are less vulnerable than bridge cross- ings, but take longer. During conflict, temporary bridge sites need to be frequently shifted. Ferry crossing sites can be shifted rapidly. Russians usually cover their bridging sites with particulate smoke.14 

&gt; * During initial engineer reconnaissance missions, special attention is paid to the banks and 
reconnaissance team members look for easy access to the water and a gently sloping entrance/exit. They examine the ground along the shore to determine whether it is firm enough to support the passage of heavy equipment. A narrow width and reasonable current are desirable. The selected area should be fairly compact and contain sufficient roads to quickly move traffic. 

&gt; * Truck columns, mountain vehicles, snow vehicles, swamp vehicles, and mixed track, and wheeled- vehicle columns move at the rate of 15–30 kilometers per hour. The distance between battalion columns is usually 2 to 3 kilometers, and the distance between vehicles is 20 to 25 meters. However, if the enemy has high-precision weap- ons, the distance between battalion columns is decreased to 1 kilometer and the distance between vehicles is increased to 100–150 meters.

They need to encircle Sieverodonetsk and they're not that far from cutting the final GLOC (6 km now).

And that pattern of behavior means he no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt. Especially given the long history of the Turks fucking the Kurds over. 

It's also worth considering the scale of what he is complaining about against the importance of Sweden and Finland joining NATO. Erdogan at first threatened to hold up the addition of these two incredibly important allies to NATO over the opinions of a few legislators in one of the two countries trying to join. Not even both countries! And not even actual government policies or diplomatic positions, but the opinions of freely elected legislators. In the west, we value free speech and the opinions expressed by legislators are not considered government policy. Every free country has legislators that express opinions that are outside the norm or differ from the official government line. 

It was clearly just an excuse, so he pivoted to claiming Sweden and Finland harbor terrorists. But those are people associated with FETO, the organization he blamed for the failed 2016 coup, despite there being no evidence of that. Sweden and Finland both consider PKK a terrorist organization, and if there were evidence of PKK members located in their borders they would absolutely act to address it. But Erdogan is actually just trying to stamp out legitimate opposition to his autocratic rule by crushing dissent even where it exists abroad, in countries where free speech rights are far better protected than in Turkey. He is, in effect, demanding that his western allies stoop to his level on human rights.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Just a quick glance at Jomini of the West's map, it looks like there are ~10-12 Ukraine brigades in the Severodonetsk salient fighting,™ with each having its own artillery battalion, plus a few independent artillery batteries and battalions. 

The US gave Ukraine enough M777 guns and trained enough artillerymen to only man a few batteries, maybe a full battalion That's basically a drop in the bucket in terms of this battle, but it's a start. It'll only go up from there, and that's where it'll matter. As the existing Ukrainian 152mm towed guns break down, get destroyed or abandoned in battle, or run out of ammo there is a replacement that's even better. Plus they can expand too with more towed batteries and battalions as the war progresses. 

Also, media attention aside towed guns have limitations in this sort of battle, where there are drones everywhere and Russians are hitting everything they see with their own arty. Tube arty are exposed when setting up, operating, and taking down their guns. M777 usually uses wheeled prime movers (vehicles that tow the gun). The type of arty that is meant for this sort of war are self propelled arty, fully enclosed tracked vehicles with armor rated against small arms and artillery fragmentation/blast, that are quicker to pick up, move, and emplace than tube arty (SPA specialize in shoot and scoot fire missions), and have better tactical mobility off-roading because they're tracked. The issue with them is they're way more complicated to operate, they require much more training for crews and mechanics, they're more expensive so there are fewer of them made, and those that are fielded are less likely to be given away by NATO countries versus towed guns. For instance, the US Marines just downsized their active duty cannon artillery of M777 from 21 batteries to 7. Which was likely why the US gave Ukraine the M777. 

That said, when it comes to towed guns, the M777 is one of the best there is, especially considering ammo options (though it doesn't look like Ukraine has access to all of them).",8db7a2f0391414f70e6b1ece88a5d8e4f83d1e5f,True,False,,,,,0,1652975598,,0,{},i97ri8h,False,t3_ut1tmt,False,True,t1_i97eydi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut1tmt/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_19_2022/i97ri8h/,1652975609,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652946798.0,

Here's a very pro-Ukrainian journalist who actually **went** to SD talking about how the troops there feel like they're on the back foot, and that's while some logistic lines are still open.

The limited logistic line to SD/Lyschiansk, consisting mainly of that one highway - go to Gaidai's (Ukrainian governor of Luhansk) telegram, he talks about how that's the one line in and out and how it's hard to do anything with it since it's now under artillery fire.

Popasna.  If you truly don't believe this I might be inclined to spend a bunch of time collating proof, but yes, it is well accepted that the new Schwerpunkt of the Russian effort now that Izium is petering out.  Plenty of fresh and/or well-trained units are being rerouted to the operational area, including high-value vehicles (https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1526976161506631680).

1. The Iraqis outnumbered the Iranians but still failed to win - this was only ever true during the IRGC recruitment shortage in the last 2 years of the war, and at that point they were winning.

2. Iraq wrongly dedicated its forces to capturing cities - all the roads in Khuzestan centered around the cities and there was no way to take the province otherwise.

3. Iraq “should have” tried to claim a border region instead of seeking regime change in Iran. It *did* try to claim a border region.

4. Iraq paid no attention to logistics - logistics was the one area of excellence of Iraqi armies during this war.

5. Iraq underestimated environmental factors - Iraqi hydraulic engineers were another star of the Iraqi war effort and constructed the famous “fish lake” barrier outside Basra.

Overall this reeks of an attempt by the primary author to superimpose all Russian problems on Iraq. As well as the opposite: the author(s) claim authoritarian regimes in general don’t hold large combined arms exercises, but Russia’s flash exercises are the largest in the world and the PLA until it’s shift towards the battalion as the basic operational unit was holding 200 brigade/division level exercises a year (!). It’s also obvious that the Putin and Saddam regime cultures are totally different. Putin from what we can tell is not micromanaging the war and has mostly left it to Shoigu and Gerasimov. Moreover he clearly is not promoting just on “loyalty” as this article claims all authoritarians do - Shoigu, a famously competent minister in his old post, was brought in to *replace* an incompetent but extremely loyal one. Gerasimov similarly replaced an inept chief of staff.

The Iraqi and Russian armies basically have opposite problems - the former had a lot of resources but completely inept leadership at all levels. The latter’s leaders are no paragons either, but that’s not their main problem.

This is 5 km push forward through ostensibly fortified terrain in about a day's work- 5 km might not be much in absolute terms but this is a frontline that hasn't moved at all for 3 months, and you can measure the distance to the remaining highway to Luhansk - the ukrainians don't have that many km to spare.

The Russians (after Izium petered out and the Bilhorivka crossing didn't work) are pouring immense resources into Popasna to orchestrate a push North (and also west to Bakhmut).  There is currently a fierce battle in Komyushanka though there is evidence that half the town is already taken.  

If the Russian push isn't contained by the units at the front (fortunately, reinforcements are reported) they'll eventually push far enough to start being able to maneuvre through large areas of land (the ground should be dry at this point) and easily interdict the final highway to Lyschiansk.

This is a dangerous situation.  There have been many of these situations where Ukraine managed to contain it, but that doesn't mean that they aren't dangerous.

The problem with that is they only do that during specific training exercises or combat, so they aren't familiar with each other. The Army has been talking about combining them for years but wouldn't do it because there are major negatives with this decision, such as tanks having totally separate logistics and maintenance and training requirements than mechanized infantry, with most of what they do to prepare for war being different than the infantry, so putting them together in the same battalion all year long dramatically complicates things for battalion HQ.

They gave up on authoritarianism, declared a democracy, and then it was a mess, for a variety of reasons, including no liberal tradition, no meaningful checks on corruption, and many other things. Do they reverted back to what felt safe, authoritarianism.

I don't think the US knows how to build a democracy. Honestly I'm not sure anyone does. My personal feeling is that a successful democracy requires the average citizen feels ownership of their country, which if true is inconsistent with America kicking out the dictator and declaring a democracy, because it means democracies can't generally be imposed.

That's where American foreign policy for the last 20 years has been wrong. We thought we could go out and sort of impose a better life on people whether they wanted it or not, eventually learned we weren't that powerful, and are now in danger of slipping into is isolationism because our interventionism didn't work.

What we should do is realize we have a more limited role we can play protecting the democracies that do organically emerge.

I totally agree! The funny thing is, I expect a majority of strategists and commentators at all levels share your view, and have shared your view for decades, and yet, we consistently get more of the same policy, which almost everybody agrees is mistaken.

The first problem is that we tend to conflate liberalism and democracy. This is very bad, because most strategically important states are important because of resources, and resource-extraction states almost never have a strong tradition of liberalism. So, when you do have a democratic revolution in a state without a tradition of liberalism, it will rarely be understood as a democracy by people in the west.

On the other side, when you have a liberal autocracy, or a liberal dictatorship, that will be typically understood as 'somewhat democratic', or essentially treated as one, even when there is no correspondence between popular desires and policy, or even, a great deal of repression.

Compounding this, if you gave the people of your average 'strategically important' state a say, the nation they would create would almost inevitably be revisionist. If you take Egypt, for a fairly extreme but useful example, you have a very poor state controlling the Suez canal, through which passes 8% of world trade! Not only do they control it, in the sense that a state-level actor could trivially block it, but the canal is so vulnerable that even a union, or a direct-action protest could block it. There is simply no way that a democracy in Egypt would not lead to a revision of Egypt's place in the world. Even if the larger part of Egyptian society wanted free trade through the canal (they don't) a minor actor could essentially hold it hostage, and there would be nothing the Egyptian state could do without resorting to violence.

If you look at Chile (27% of world copper, almost entirely from one mine) or Saudi Arabia, or really any number of nations, you see states where, if they had healthy and functioning democracies, they absolutely would not be well-behaved participants in the current world order, because they're essentially being shafted, and even if you could buy off the larger part of the population, it would just take a few hundred miners, dockworkers, or railway workers to object, and you would be back to square one.

The last problem is that people who work in the state department (or in western foreign policy establishments more generally) typically have a weak, often partial, typically outdated understanding of the histories and cultures they are dealing with. For instance, in Afghanistan, the west essentially tried to create a regime composed of diaspora Afghanis, despite the fact that many of them had not lived in Afghanistan for decades, and had no real understanding of the state they returned to. So, even if you want to support democracy, it's really hard for westerners to tell if somebody is just making the right noises (e.g. Abiy Ahmed, Assad before the civil war, Putin in the 2000's) while being essentially a sociopathic autocrat.",302a06552b703914c9a58c440579d90f1aaa59ff,True,False,,,,,0,1652948226,,0,{},i96gajp,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i96ak2v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i96gajp/,1652948240,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652919426.0,

Well that just kinda sums up the problem with war crimes tribunals in the first place.

In practice they work as show trials. So long as nations remain sovereign it will always be thus.

Just look at the yugoslav tribunal. You have NATO providing all the evidence they can on the 'enemy', and then concealing all evidence of their own side's mishaps whilst politically pressuring the tribunal funded by and staffed by western/nato countries not to look into 'our side'. 

[This is the chief prosecutor](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/former-chief-prosecutor-carla-del-ponte-i-keep-telling-myself-that-justice-will-prevail-a-21b02282-89d5-4e7b-b32c-ab16bc1b778b)

&gt; &gt; Del Ponte: it is true that the international community, NATO, had proof of the crimes committed by the Serbs, and they provided that to us, which made things move faster. But it is also true that the U.S. didn’t want us to scrutinize war crimes in Kosovo, for political reasons. We had a lot of trouble investigating the KLA, the Kosovar militia, because the U.S. slowed us down.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; DER SPIEGEL: Did U.S. politicians tell you explicitly not to investigate the Kosovars?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Del Ponte: No, because then I could have complained in public. But Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state at the time, told me over the phone: Carla, slowly, slowly. Be careful with (former KLA leader Ramush) Haradinaj, otherwise there will be unrest in Kosovo.

War crimes trials are an absolute shitshow in terms of actually serving their perceived purpose imo. They're inherently politicised and inherently favour one side over the other

&gt; Secondly, the point of punishment is to deter future crimes. If the current trials in Ukraine sends a message that war-crimes will be persecuted and that we will see less of them in the future, even if just marginally, then I'd say keep them coming.

alternatively it could send the message that you should never surrender or they'll put you in actual prison for life.

The lesson i take from historic war crimes trials is 'always be on the side of the west and you'll be fine', as cynical and depressing as that is.",9cf24e172ab26ddaa0bb1912b28254ce796e0d9d,True,False,,,,,0,1652947069,,0,{},i96f0nf,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i93vj1c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i96f0nf/,1652947082,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652918269.0,

[],False,,Acies,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mz6e,False,False,"&gt;This is not true. The best thing for a hegemonic state is to have a world filled with unhealthy dictatorships that depend on the hegemon for regime survival. The reason is obvious: democracies occasionally tell you where you can shove it. Dependent dictatorships have no such luxury. That's why this has been the consistent tendency in foreign policy for all states (UK, France, US, pre-war Japan etc) who want to have a 'sphere of influence', or an area over which they have suzerainty.

This is short term and mistaken thinking.

First, the dependent dictatorships aren't stable. They don't always stay dictatorships, and they don't always stay dependent. The US is going though a hard time now because they tried your strategy and now two of their dependent dictatorships, Russia and China, aren't looking a dependent as they did 20ish years ago. This is particularly a bad strategy for the US because although we aren't great on human rights, we aren't willing to be brutal enough to effectively stamp out dissent and support our dependent dictatorships like, say, Russia will.

Second, we aren't a resource extraction focused empire like most historic empires have been. We are benefiting from things like being the world's reserve currency, and selling the best military equipment the world has ever seen, but overall we aren't benefiting from our empire to the extent that, say, Britain did. Mostly what we want out of our empire for the last 30 years has been free trade and for people to stop fighting so we can keep the commerce going. That's been a good deal for the rest of the world, and better than the alternatives, which is why they let us keep doing it.

&gt;PS: This is also the (cynical) reason why the US/EU can support, say, Saudia Arabian or Egyptian dictatorships, both of whom are strategically important, while supporting democracy in Ukraine. A Ukrainian democracy weakens Russian control over it immediate neighbors, no matter that democracies' orientation. An Egyptian or Saudi democracy would be an uncontrollable entity sitting on vital strategic interests (Suez canal, Saudi oil).

We support Saudi Arabia and Egypt because they are important to trade. But they, especially Saudi Arabia, have also caused us a  ton of problems over the years, including screwing us on the oil embargo, 9/11 and the war in terror, and creating decades of war and instability in the middle east we have to clean up after. In contrast, Norway, a democracy, has caused us none of these problems despite also having oil. This goes to show that democracies are better for us. And again democracies will actually have our backs when the inevitable great power struggles pop up again, not like the authoritarians that reliably screw us first chance they get.

If we could, we would have converted Egypt and Saudi Arabia into Norway clones decades ago. But we don't know how to create democracies, so all we can do is support the ones that we find.

I'll also add that back during the cold war we more actively suppressed democratic movements on the theory that they were close to communism for comfort. I'm inclined to say that was a bad idea back then too, but it's unquestionably a stupid idea today now that the primary ideology threat is fascism rather than communism.",906d53e3a9c6011d9187bbf46ad3b0d8c5877446,True,False,,,,,0,1652943218,,0,{},i96ak2v,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i96682n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i96ak2v/,1652943235,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652914418.0,

Yes for PKK and maybe SDF, no for FETO. Also a qualifier on all discussions regarding these organizations - much more likely that Turkey gets a bilateral deal with the US on these issues than a multilateral deal with all of NATO.

&gt;The United States and other NATO bodies must lift all sanctions related to Turkey’s purchase of the S-400, including sanctions upon the Turkish Defense Industry Directorate. 

Some of these sanctions can surely be lifted.

&gt;Turkey would not only receive the new F-16s and upgrade kits for its existing fleet, but Turkey will also be able to rejoin the F-35 program from which it was expelled after activating the Russian S-400s. 

Yes on F-16, no on F-35. Maybe they work out an arrangement where Turkey gets rid of the S-400 or stops having Russia maintain them? Given Ukraine, does Turkey really want a Russian air defense system Russia has access too? Seems to present problems with both security and possibly the whole system sucking.

&gt;Lastly, the United States would cease preventing Turkey from exporting military products containing Western components.

[],False,,June1994,,,[],,,,text,t2_fgez9,False,True,"Dara Massicot is an analyst from RAND who specializes in the Russian military. I first read, well, listened, to her work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Uv6RH8eWs). That video is mostly based on their RAND report, *The Russian Way of Warfare* [here](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE231.html). 

In general I find her work good and interesting, but in my opinion, this piece, like some of her other work exposes her weakness in crafting grand narratives. Her work is best when it focuses on tendencies, observations, and details. This article, like some of her other work, is far too broad, makes a lot of assumptions based on anecdotal evidence, and tends to be what I would describe as results-based analysis. 

A lot of analysts are prone to this, ergo, see a lot of publications and panic in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea. 

&gt;Despite its sophisticated military equipment and multiple advantages on paper, Russia has stumbled strategically, operationally, and tactically in Ukraine. It has been hampered by faulty planning assumptions, unrealistic timelines, and impractical objectives. It has suffered from inadequate supplies, bad logistics, and insufficient force protection. It has been impaired by poor leadership. These problems do not stop at technical equipment issues, poor training, or corruption. Rather, they are linked by a core underlying theme: **the military’s lack of concern for the lives and well-being of its personnel.**

I am in agreement with this paragraph and I find this to be the best part of the article, which is unfortunately, marred by its conclusion. 

The Russian War of Warfare, as described by Michael Kofman [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UktY0XePs0), ironically, believes that the initial period of conflict, will shape and define the course of the entire conflict. 

Well, I would argue that Russia's thinking here is correct, and Russia's faulty and catastrophic assumptions about the war have indeed shaped the course and character of this entire conflict. To be more straightforward, I believe that Dara Massicot is correct about all of the failures of this campaign and the rot within Russia's military, but unlike her, I do not believe that this is something inherent to the military culture of Russia, rather, it is inherent to the poor planning and catastrophic assumptions Russia's leadership had when they went into this conflict. 

&gt;Had excessive operational security not trumped force protection, for instance, the military could have better prepared and trained the force for the kinds of grinding, urban battles they were certain to face. But because it was worried about leaks, the Russian military kept its plans a secret to almost all of the military (or at least to the rank and file), jeopardizing readiness and handicapping itself.

But OPSEC did trump preparations. It is clear that Russia did not believe this would be a long and drawn out affair. Considering Russia's assumption, why do we assume that their lack of preparation was ""wrong""? This is results-based analysis. 

In reality, what we ought to criticize is not the decision of Russia to sacrifice troop safety and preparedness, but their faulty intelligence work going into this operation. 

Consider America's experience in [Iraq](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/iraq-without-a-plan/). We ended up occupying Iraq for 10 years, pouring hundreds of billions of dollars, and losing thousands of U.S. soldiers because we had **the wrong assumptions and operational planning** for the Post-Saddam phase of the war/occupation. 

Was that a sign of something fundamentally wrong with U.S. military culture? Or was it a sign of poor intelligence work, poor planning, and delusional assumptions? 

&gt;Radiation poisoning is a particularly extreme example of how the Russian military’s mistreatment of troops undermines its fighting capacity. But there are plenty of others. 

All due respect, but this is making a mountain out of a molehill. As the extremely Pro-Russian New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/08/world/europe/ukraine-chernobyl.html) points out, radiation levels are low, and while exposure is certainly not ideal, radiation exposure is not a significant threat in an active warzone. 

Bullets and artillery are, and they are a much more immediate possibility, even if you expect light to non-existent resistance as Russians did. 

&gt;Soldiers became affected with frostbite thanks to poor planning and then were treated by Russian medics with 44-year-old field dressings. 

Again, this is the result of delusional planning and bad Russian intelligence work. Russian generals did not turn a blind eye to such issues. This is the result of poor planning and Russia's expectation of a quick and easy campaign where operational security trumped preparation.

And preparation would weed a lot of these issues out. These soldiers did not expect a war. And parking troops out in the field for months exacted its toll in [negligence](https://twitter.com/TrentTelenko/status/1499164245250002944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). 

&gt;The Russian military’s disregard for its soldiers has done more than undermine their combat performance. It has also tanked their morale and will to fight. Officers steal the contents of care packages so routinely that some soldiers have called their mothers and told them not to bother sending anything. Officials forget to pay soldiers their entitled combat pay, and units abandon the bodies of the fallen. 

Again, anecdotal evidence. There are certainly instances of this, and I do not doubt that they are not uncommon. However, there is just as many instances of soldiers getting what they need, of care packages arriving where they need to, and of Russian troops having generally high morale. 

All in all, I am disappointed in this article. It seeks to paint a narrative, not an objective analysis. There is not a whole of substance to this story, though this is understandable, as Dana Massicot has been largely absent from work during this conflict. She only recently came back from maternity leave. 

However, this is a good example of our echo-chambers running wild with conclusions and looking for evidence that reinforces our priors. 

I encourage people to watch Ukrainian and Russian telegram channels, and do a lot more primary research. It is clear, that even professional analysts are caught up in the narrative and ""morale-building"" (to put it nicely) rather than objective analysis. 

I think the most negative thing I've seen from Western analysts was Kofman remarking that Ukrainians have suffered serious casualties this war. Something people do not recognize, imagining Ukraine is scoring 1:10 KD ratios. 

Believe me, this is not the case. In terms of numbers, Ukraine arguably has more manpower available and deployed for the last several weeks. If KD ratios were so favorable, they wouldn't be asking for more Western aid and getting pushed back in the Donbass. 

The best example of this... shoddy war reporting is probably the [Institute of War.](https://www.understandingwar.org/) Note that the briefings that are published almost never mention that Russia has captured a city or a village or... well, anything really. Yet, with time, the maps inevitably have to change to reflect the reality of the situation. This is simply not an objective way to report the war. 

I think analyst and publications have to come to terms with a reality that Russia has significantly changed their tactics, have significantly lowered their rate of attrition, and are now having steady progress in the Donbass area. 

Going by the reporting, Kherson should've been taken three weeks ago by Ukrainian forces. Yet either through stunning inaction, catastrophic failure, or maybe, possibly, actual Russian tactical success in Kherson Oblast has allowed Russia to regain all of the territory it lost an April and capture most of Kherson Oblast, as well as being in position to threaten Krivoi Rog and Mykolaiv.",cc1a183e25cf0ac609154df5d925057d2d97e371,True,False,,,,,0,1652939222,,0,{},i965gr8,False,t3_ushfw3,False,True,t3_ushfw3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ushfw3/the_russian_militarys_people_problem_its_hard_for/i965gr8/,1652939235,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652910422.0,

The American people, however, weren't too interested in sending their sons and fathers to fight overseas, and therefore he had to get the U.S. involved slowly and incrementally.

Eh I don't particularly want to debate history as it's far outside of my field, but I think Roosevelt wanted to see the Anglo-American alliance dominate the European continent as well as defang German militarism (see: Richard Overy's Why the Allies Won for a great summary of this political consideration). I found Overy's own assertion that American foreign policy from 1935-45 was a real mixed bag, off the top of my head he argues that:

* America accomplished a lot but also gave a *lot* of ground in the East (I think the phrase he uses is ""made Europe safe for Communism"")
* America defeated Japan but failed to secure a long-run alliance with China, instead allowing China to fall to communism. In particular he is a *scathing* critic of FDR for allowing McArthur to run roughshod over military political divides and position the US towards prioritizing the Philippines over Formosa and subsequently China. 

Anyway I don't want to get too deep into the details here but it's interesting to note that a more long-run view of American participation in WW2 showcases a real off-the-cuff approach to policy (sound familiar?) and a lack of realistic assessments of strategic priorities (come on, losing China to commnism?

And I'm sure that all of this indecisiveness and lack of deterrence capabilities caused Ukraine to be extra careful as well. It thought in the way that stuff like mobilization before the invasion would escalate tensions, an opinion that was certainly shared by most of the EU governments that completely dismissed the invasion. And so, I don't think the Ukrainian government was even sure that they had anyone to count on, especially if they were seen as the ones that further escalated the conflict.  

What I do think shocked the Ukrainians was that they almost certainly expected the Russian attack to be in one direction (from the donbass).

1. Ukraine's government did not prepare properly for the war, even though they had 3+ months. Territorial Defense units were not prepared, and everyone in the government procrastinated on it. Butusov thinks the old TDF commander was recently replaced so that the government can put all the issues on him: 

2. Butusov estimated that Ukraine has mobilized up to 700,000 people. However, the vast majority of them are untrained and underequipped and fit mostly for covering vast amounts of the front where Russian troops are either withdrawing or not actively attacking. This creates major issues with abilities to rotate, but he thinks in time as the mobilized units get battle experience, this issue will be solved.

3. Ukraine's government was not and is not prepared to effectively use donations to equip troops the same way volunteers do. There's a lack of understanding of what is needed and incompetence in knowing the logistics to supply a large number of troops. The majority of the war effort is currently being supplied by volunteers, with the government putting more focus on diplomatic pressure and direct materiel deliveries.

Of _course_ it is. Convenient. Once we dismiss the evidence we don't like as ""trash"", it is very easy to defend a preconceived viewpoint :)

&gt;Feel free to show me why it's patently false. You can keep repeating this statement; it won't magically become true the next time you say it.

Actually, I did in my previous post. If you were unable (unwilling?) to see it, I'm not sure what mroe I can add. See: ""_you quote a book which only studies the period between 1959 and 1963 to speak to more than 70 years of exchanges over a contentious border. Even if Hoffman is entirely right (and he isn’t—others like Litner have published very convincing theses of China’s aggressive posture along the border), extrapolating one theme from book that deals with the early 60s to the period between the 70s through 2020 is quite odd. And the conclusion you reach is indeed patently false._""

&gt;&gt; Following the 1962 war, India has approached the border question with a much greater degree of realism, but the Chinese side, having stating a psychological victory, was in no mood to negotiate in good faith.

&gt;What the hell were they doing while waiting?

Here's I think a productive way to look at this. There's a pre-war saying that I like: Russia has a modern army, and Russia has a large army. The problem is that these are two separate armies.

Today you gotta replace that with ""half-competent"" and ""halfway-sizeable"". Imagine that you're a colonel in a random military base in Shitaratov, Russia. You have all your regular corruption problems, but on top of that you have a very clear understanding: you never ever are going to end up actually fighting in a war. Few people buy the NATO threat line: who the fuck is going to attack the country with the most nukes? Your unit is not relevant enough to get sent to Syria, there you have to deliver results. So what do you do? Remember which country gave birth to the idiom Potemkin village?

You do the bare minimum needed to get by, process the conscripts, and steal stuff. Why the hell would you do actual relevant training? That's for the Syria guys and poster boys like VDV. Achieving anything like a war objective is not conceivably on your horizon.

Watch the interviews with the Russian POWs, even officers: it was just mind-blowing to them that they live in a world where they can actually be sent to war, where people actually shoot at you. Russian army spent all of March trying to adjust to that mental break. You're right that Putin didn't cause this, the true cause lies deeper than Putin.

There are many more similarities in the two conflicts than I would have realized, and the two authors make their case very well. The ending paragraph about how Saddam's Iraq began to strike out in increasing violence and use of weapons of mass destruction was a bad omen for what Putin could be thinking about doing in the future. 

-----------------

&gt; * Iraq invaded Iran, expecting to win in just a few days, but found itself mired in a brutal conflict that lasted nearly a decade. Analyzing the early years of this conflict suggests political, strategic, and tactical problems that tend to limit combat effectiveness in “strongman” regimes. 

&gt; * While regime type is just one of many factors in combat effectiveness, looking closely at what unfolded in the Middle East two generations ago can help understand what is happening today in Ukraine. This article delves into the Iraqi military’s promotion, training, command, and information-sharing behaviors, all of which express themselves in Russia’s military today. The parallels suggest that Russia has much learning and adapting to do, and it may escalate to buy the time needed to adapt.

&gt; * In The Dictator’s Army, Caitlin Talmadge offers a framework for assessing authoritarian regimes and their military organizational practices. She considers four areas of military behavior — promotion patterns, training regimens, command arrangements, and information management — that shape combat effectiveness, arguing that the authoritarian desire to deter coups (or to solidify power) requires specific military organizational practices that impede battlefield performance. 

&gt; * Effective militaries center their promotion patterns on merit, but authoritarian regimes tend to prize political loyalties and personal ties over competence. 

&gt; * Successful militaries implement robust training regimens that enable complex operations. However, training is expensive, and it risks creating a broad base of effective troops that could threaten the centralized power of an authoritarian state. Authoritarian leaders tend to avoid combined arms live-fire exercises and other realistic training methods, fearing that armed military units marching within the country might offer a pretext for a coup.

&gt; * Allowing autonomy among military units or building a strong NCO corps risks creating alternative power structures that could undermine state power. 

&gt; * The result was a military terrified of creatively approaching problems that instead followed centralized orders to the letter, even when they made no strategic or tactical sense.

&gt; * Militaries benefit from robust information-sharing processes, ensuring the free flow of honest information, both horizontally and vertically. Paranoid states limit information to a small, trusted group. In addition, authoritarian regimes limit dissenting information and prevent officers from openly disagreeing with leadership, which invariably leads to dishonest, overly optimistic assessments. 

&gt; * On a tactical level, a poor training regimen meant that Iraqi conscripts could not defeat their enemy despite having far larger numbers. 

&gt; * Problems in these four areas — promotion patterns, training regimen, command arrangements, and information management — have also plagued Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, contributing to a poorly thought-out strategic decision to invade, overconfidence in a set of simplistic military objectives, and a lack of preparation to sustain anything but the shortest of conflicts. Much like Iraq in 1981, Russia now seems to be scaling back its definition of “victory” to better align with military realities, but it has not shrunk from its strategic objectives.

&gt; *  To buy time and maintain his regime until this learning process could take effect, Saddam escalated: He disrupted global energy (“the Tanker War”), he attacked civilian populations (the “War of the Cities”), and he used chemical weapons on both military and civilian targets.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces are continuing to inflict air and artillery strikes on the Azovstal Steel Plant, indicating that a remnant of Ukrainian defense is still in the plant despite evacuations over the last few days.  
Russian occupying authorities are reportedly planning to level the Azovstal Steel Plant after completing its capture, which directly undermines the large strategic economic importance of capturing the plant.  
Russian forces continued to prepare for an assault on Severodonetsk and intensified operations around Lyman.  
Russian forces continued to prioritize holding positions around the Russian border to prevent further Ukrainian advances north of Kharkiv City and will likely continue to do so at the expense of deploying additional reinforcements to other axes of advance.  
Russian troops focused on maintaining their positions on the Southern Axis and on conducting rocket, missile, and artillery strikes along the frontline.
