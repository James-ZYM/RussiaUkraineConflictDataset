You have to understand that when we are raising these points, as people of the global south, it's not ""whataboutism"" for us. It's ""what about us"".

Many things the US, and other countries have done, have had terrible consequences, directly or indirectly, on entire countries, on the lives of millions of people, on several generations. I don't think many people realize the domino effect the invasion of just one country can have on an entire region and culture.

Would you guys be willing to give up certain commodities the way Russians did, in order to have an effect against western aggressions? So that your countries would stop? Or just to give reparations to the countries affected? Would you be in favor of sanctions? 

I am very happy for how much Ukrainians are getting support. No one should have to endure war. However, I'm not going to lie, it's infuriating and I can't help but see it as a big ""fuck you"" to the global south. I'm very disappointed in how the western population is taking any criticism of the hypocrisy of their international behavior as either Russian propaganda, or ""whataboutism"" and not willing to address calls for equal accountability. Surely you understand that many of our countries, who have good ties with Russia, are not going to sanction them and make our barely developped countries' situation even worse, just to please the hegemony, when we have been literally begging western countries for as little as  acknowledging war crimes, and returning stolen artefact. The bar is that low and we can't even get that. 

So please, can anyone give me a straight answer to this: why is the western population so up in arms about this, and not about the countless atrocities their countries have committed? I'm genuinely asking, how can so many fail to see the hypocrisy? Like, just acknowledgment is all we're asking for. We wouldn't even *dream* of asking for sanctions, reparations or a trial.

- Probably to maintain secrecy, most Russia troop weren't told about the war until right before they invaded. Some loaded up still thinking they were on the way to a field exercise. When they were told, they were told not to expect to fight. Meaning they were not mentally prepared to fight, to suffer, to kill, to lose buddies, which means the rates of psychological trauma is going to be through the roof

- Their supply system broke down very early and although it's gotten better, it's not perfect, nor did the troops forget it happened. And it wasn't just fuel and ammo that wasn't moving up, food and clean water too. They say armies move on their stomachs, I bet they aren't eating well. One hot meal a day is the historic standard for a chain of command in combat to try to keep their troops' morale up, do you think they're getting a hot meal a day even now?

- This war started in late February, in the beginning of mud season. Freezing temps, sleet, slow, rain. They probably didn't pack for shit because it wasn't supposed to last long. Cold and wet all the time. Chapped lips, fingers perpetually hurting from the cold, trench foot, etc. Everyone is probably miserable 24/7. 

- Sanitation wise, when do you think they last took a hot shower? Took an indoor shit? Slept in a real bed in a heated room? Washed their hands before they ate? Russians have always been notorious for being disgusting in the field, that comes with a cost. You get sick more often (respiratory and stomach bugs, wet coughs and diarrhea all the time), lice, you just feel like shit. 

- Since Day 1 they've been getting their butts kicked and that's always a kick in the balls. Heavy casualties, they went in thinking it was going to be a cake walk and now they're praying they survive

- Leadership. At this point do you think any of them have a lot of confidence in their chain of command? From platoon leader to Putin, they'll likely subject to scorn, especially the rear echelon higher ranking officers and politicians who fucked everything up but don't have to face the repercussions because they're not in the shit. 

Are they getting regular mail? Probably not since their access to internet is being restricted. Want to call home? Sorry we blew up 3G networks.

First off, the USSR/Russians did this near exact same thing multiple times in their history. Hungary '56, Czechoslovakia '68, Chechnya '94, Georgia '08, Crimea '14, and Ukraine '22. All were show of force military invasions focused on mechanized advances designed to utterly overwhelm an enemy into submissions with the belief the enemy wouldn't resist much if at all. The result: 6x invasions was 4x successes and 2x fuckups because the enemy actually fought back hard, which comes a 66% success rate while discounting the enemy. Arguably the same thing happened in Poland '39 and Finland '40 so fuck it, let's call it 8x attempts and 3.5 blew up in their faces (Poland was a victory but they didn't do well), so still better than 50% success rate discounting resistance. 

In terms of the US we made plenty of bad intelligence assessments throughout our history that had made operational and strategic affects.

The 2003 OIF invasion intel assessment that the Iraqis wouldn't fight back had little to nothing to do with 1991 and more to do with flowery statements made by the same Iraqi expatriates that lied to us about WMDs and other assumptions originating from White House neocon advisors. We went in knowing full well we had too few troops but White House, SECDEF, and CENTCOM were fine with that (it was their idea) because they believed the Iraqis wouldn't resist. And the only reason OIF was so easy and why they barely resisted was because Saddam made an even worse intel assessment than Russia did in 2022, he decided Bush was bluffing and allowed no preparation before the invasion, and it was too late after it started.

And let's not forget that ""Mission Accomplished"" didn't mark the end of the conflict against Saddam or other Iraqis defending their country and trying to kick the US out. The US utterly discounted the possibility of an insurgency, so that alone totally proves your point wrong. 

But why stop there when there are so many more instances of strategic and operational military intelligence failures in our past?

Where was the brilliance in Afghanistan knowing that the Taliban was capable of resurgent operations? How about that pull-out in 2021? We did a hell of a job predicting what it would cause? 

The 1999 NATO attack on Serbia was nearly 4 months of bombing them daily, an operation that was supposed to be a cakewalk, demonstrate the awe inspiring might of AIR POWER, but instead we ended up losing a stealth fighter to ADA, accidentally hitting Chinese embassy, massively overestimating success because they used decoys, and only a threat of ground invasion ended that conflict. 

The UN mission in Somalia didn't take into consideration anyone would resist and when they did and the US sent TF Ranger after Aidid, and then the most HSLD unit in the US military fucked up during OP Gothic Serpent going into a crowded Aidid controlled market area in broad daylight with a really shitty plan because they didn't think the locals would actually fight back.

There were operations done both in Panama and Grenada that were tactical clusterfucks because the enemy wasn't planned to fight back, like the SEAL assault on the airport in Panama, the CAG air assault against Richmond Hill prison in Grenada. Or how about needing to use tourist maps for Grenada because the military didn't have any? 

The Mayaguez incident in the 70s was a major fuckup because they didn't take enemy resistance into account. Shameful really...

A bunch of similar incidents in Vietnam, too many to list, but let's just go with ""Stand down, the enemy isn't planning anything on Tet '68, so everyone can relax."" Whoopsie

Korea? Holy fucking shit, read up on Task Force Smith, with pretty much everyone from a battalion commander to Macarthur thinking that a single battalion of the US Army was going to stop the Korean advance because the KPA would be too scared to fight Americans. And let's not forget the brilliant decision that nope, the Chinese were not going to intervene in Korea made in fall/winter 1950.

Heading back to WW2, from start to finish I'll list a couple: Not protecting Pearl Harbor. Kasserine Pass. The invasion of Salerno. Market Garden. Ardennes Dec 1944.

The concept has more or less already been tried in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the form of torpedo boat swarms. Many theorists thought that large groups of fast torpedo boats could effectively make large capital ships obsolete by overwhelming them with large numbers of cheap but potentially lethal smaller vessels. 

This could have potentially worked for a very brief period around the turn of the century, but quickly navies with larger ships began planning against this strategy with more smaller batteries on capital ships and eventually large numbers of accompanying escorts (torpedo boat destroyers) designed to ward off such swarms before the could get close enough to launch. Navies still typically operate this way today, with large ships almost always being accompanied by smaller escorts designed to ward off other small craft as well as typically a significant air escort that would have plenty of time to engage such small vessels before they got into range. 

While the ranges and lethality have grown in the modern day, they've grown on both sides and I would argue more-or-less leaves the balance of power between small, short range attack craft and more typical naval formations roughly in the same place it has been for the past 100+ years. The small vessels are certainly a threat that needs to be accounted for, but the nature of that threat is understood and the necessary countermeasures should be in place to handle said threat. 

You are correct that a lone capital ship would theoretically be vulnerable to such a swarm of small missile boats, but this is the reason that modern navies do not leave capital ships alone to fend for themselves. And if intelligence suggested that an enemy or potentially enemy was building up large numbers of these small attack craft, you can bet that navies with potentially vulnerable capital ships would bulk up the number of accompanying escorts when operating in the area.",dcdc82b711866e78b9df364f1bf8b1cd37bcae8f,True,False,,,,,0,1650059681,,0,{},i4vuu5z,False,t3_u18fq1,False,True,t1_i4p2inl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u18fq1/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_11th/i4vuu5z/,1650059699,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650030881.0

Submarine-launched ballistic missiles have served indispensably as part of most, if not all nuclear-armed states' deterrence structures for decades without fail, proving the feasibility of the concept without any significant compromises or challenges with performance and capabilities (at least, currently) on-par with their ground-based counterparts.

Given the seeming similarities between the two types, how practical (and affordable) would it be for a nation which already has an SLBM fleet to develop and deploy a ground-based ICBM force by producing a minimally-modified variant of the former that is suited for basing from land silos? If it were, then why hasn't such a plan been implemented for cost reduction and part-standardisation reasons?

TL;DR: Why hasn't a ground-based ICBM been developed from (or jointly developed as) an SLBM? Wouldn't the development and operational costs be significantly lower to develop a missile to do both?

Bonus question: Would the development and deployment of (or at least, the illusion of, even) a ground-based strategic deterrent that will form part of a triad (from a dyad that comprised SLBMS and ALBMS/ cruise missiles/gravity bombs) be worth it as part of a tactic to force the opponent to ""waste"" warheads on additional counterforce targets, thus reducing harm to potential countervalue targets?",f247f7ac052878bf0ede6c9556e7716aeb43a7ed,True,False,,,,,0,1650055738,,0,{},i4vm5sy,False,t3_u18fq1,False,True,t3_u18fq1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u18fq1/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_11th/i4vm5sy/,1650055752,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650026938.0

&gt; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, accompanied by nuclear threats to deter intervention by NATO states, is unlikely to spark a broad wave of nuclear proliferation. However, growing concerns among political leaders in Japan and South Korea about nuclear coercion by China and North Korea, and questions about the durability of U.S. defense commitments, is driving interest in nuclear acquisition. To stanch this interest, the United States may be pressured to share nuclear weapons with these allies, while Russia could look to deploy nuclear weapons on the territories of its allies.

------------------

A quote about Ukraine's lack of a nuclear weapon deterrent (this is a topic about which there is still much disinformation)

&gt; A popular but ahistorical narrative is emerging about Russia’s war on Ukraine: if only Kyiv had retained the Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on its territory at the end of the Cold War, it could have deterred Vladimir Putin’s nuclear-backed annexation of Crimea in 2014 and attempted occupation of the rest of Ukraine today. This narrative ignores the fact that those weapons were controlled by Russia and Ukrainian leaders at the time did not want to be treated as an international pariah for attempting to become a nuclear-armed state. Rather than focus on a flawed counterfactual that emphasizes the importance of nuclear power, the world would be much better off asking how Russia’s actions could affect nuclear nonproliferation.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Yes and no. Mostly the US reported accurate information, especially in terms of statistics. A lot of people like to shit all over the body count metric (the real truth there is that it was just not as important as people say it was) but the counts themselves were, more or less, accurate on the big unit level. The Pentagon and MACV were well aware of the flaws of using that metric, and they used statistical corrections and other sources of information (more than just weapons recovered or bodies found) to try and generate a picture of the state of the VC and NVA in the south. 

The more faulty statistic that gets published a lot is the Hamlet Evaluation statistics, which graded hamlets from F= VC controlled to A=pro Saigon and secure. This became popular after 1969 as a way of tracking the ‘hearts and minds’ side of the war and how pacification was working. But it was basically made up bullshit. Some in the State Department and Saigon knew it was made up bullshit, but the sad fact is that many both at the time and today place a lot of stock in the HES findings. It’s a lie, but one that MACV told itself as much as everyone else. 

Most important tho was that the Army lied through carefully managed statistics and a controlled narrative. And the media totally ran with these statistics to advance their own narratives in the war. A great example was “reconnaissance by fire,” a practice in which artillery would be called down on a grid square. Places where a base was *suspected* but not observed to be, or where troop movements were *probably* happening. The arty would smash up the place and if anyone was seen trying to break out they would be engaged with other weapons. Often this artillery was unspotted and wildly inaccurate, and even at the time was heavily criticized for hurting the ‘hearts and minds’ side of the war. After all what civilian wants to be caught up in a hurricane bombardment targeting a base that doesn’t even exist? It was claimed by MACV that the practice had ended with the shift from Westmoreland to Abrams, and the media ran with the published statistics. It fit their narrative that Abrams was fighting a ‘better war’ which would produce better results (which, btw, is where a lot of the anti-body count, anti-search and destroy rhetoric comes from. Abrams never ended either of them.) If you look at the statistics MACV actually put out though, you’d see that artillery expenditure reporting changed subtly. It went from, IIRC, 5 categories of missions including ‘recon’ to 7, mostly with new names and including a new “other” category. And wouldn’t you know, ‘other’ increased in 1969 at almost the exact same rate that ‘recon’ decreased.

BUT in a near peer armoured fight aka Ukraine you are correct. You need self propelled artillery that can shoot and scoot and is armoured to a degree. In this fight mounted mortars in the back of AFV's and 155 mm SPG's are required.  Precision is great but the suppressive effect is still required. Without suppressive effects infantry and armoured forces cannot close with an enemy. Re drones at this stage I believe them to be something to watch.

* he's actually talked to, interviewed, and assessed the unit semi-recently, so he's as expert as anybody is with regard to their current situation.

&gt;  
&gt;Facts and myths about the Azov Regiment. Making them a ""Death Star"" is a big exaggeration"".  
&gt;  
&gt;March 18 2022  
&gt;  
&gt;*Azov is a regiment that was born from the Ukrainian volunteer battalion that was formed in 2014. This was a volunteer battalion with a nationalist profile. It was attracted by football fans, hooligans, etc., mainly from eastern Ukraine, i.e. Russian-speaking. This battalion, and then a regiment, became a unit of the normal Ukrainian Armed Forces, in fact a special unit of what we might call the Ukrainian military police* said Kacper Rękek from the Center for Research on Extremism at the University of Oslo. He added: the veterans of this unit founded the National Corps political party and the socio-political movement.  
&gt;  
&gt;The latter uses the name ""*Azov Movement*"". *This is where this great hoax really comes from. People confuse the two with the other* \- remarked Dr. Rękek. The regiment that is now fighting in Mariupol, which grows out of the voluntary, ideological root, but now has very little to do with this root. It is simply a unit that could theoretically be accessed and enrolled by anyone. They did not identify recruits in terms of their devotion to nationalism or Ukrainian fascism, he noted.  
&gt;  
&gt;The expert noted that although the National Corps is currently headed by the former commander of the Azov regiment, the fates of these two entities are now largely separate.  
&gt;  
&gt;*I have the impression that the regiment is hit by the far-right actions of the Azov Movement and the National Corps party. The links between them, this umbilical cord has long been severed to a large extent. This does not prevent the Russians from heating up this topic and saying that this is some great socio-political movement that has its militia in the form of this regiment. It is not so. Nobody in Kiev, no politician, no fascist, Ukrainian nationalist or anyone else gives orders to this regiment. It is in the normal command structure.*  
&gt;  
&gt;He agreed with the statement that one of the reasons for the media popularity of the Azov regiment is better PR than other Ukrainian units. They also take advantage of this nefarious PR that has been following them since 2014. As of 2014, there were talk of some Nazis in Ukraine who had assembled into a battalion - one of 40 volunteer battalions.  
&gt;  
&gt;*They, taking advantage of it a bit, know that more people will automatically notice them because they have this story and that name. Their PR people, media people and graphic designers are simply better than the statistical graphic designers in other units of the Ukrainian army* \- analyzed Dr. Rękek. Further there are references to nationalist, fascist symbols. They know it's wrong, but they take the attitude that no matter what you say, it's important that you speak. This also creates a bigger myth of the most efficient unit of the Ukrainian National Guard - described the expert.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Rękek pointed out that the Azov regiment had undergone some kind of purge some time ago and excluded the most radical members from its ranks. The most radical members of this regiment came from Russia, the extreme Russian right, he explained. Azov has undergone some kind of transformation. *It was not decided to change its name to force it to change its logo. Maybe this is a topic for conversation after this war* \- he added. As he noted, the National Corps party, which originated from the original ranks of the unit, did not enjoy much support in Ukraine. It won 2 percent in the last election. votes and has 20 councilors throughout Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Rękek added that although a few years ago members of the Azov regiment spoke in the media about their fascination with nationalism or fascism, such situations do not take place today. He continued: No member will stand in front of the cameras and say a word about politics. I tried to persuade such confessions - admitted the expert. They say: you can talk about politics with some other political actors, but not with us. We are a normal regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard. We think what we think, but we will not talk to you about it - certainly not for the camera or the dictaphone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Rękek estimated that the Russians would continue to refer to the black legend and the controversy surrounding the Azov regiment. There are only limits to which this balloon can be inflated, because then it just becomes funny - he reserved. As soon as the Russians bomb a target in Mariupol, they immediately say that Azov was there. There would be 100,000 of them - he explained.  
&gt;  
&gt;*This is a topic for Ukraine. This is a topic that will have to be dealt with after this war. We should not forget about them, but making them some kind of far-right ""Death Star"" is a great exaggeration.*",f6c33963f9247502f274911934a9abede91dfc70,True,False,,,,,0,1650046702,,0,{},i4v0zzm,False,t3_u46gf9,False,True,t1_i4uuvwb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u46gf9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_15_2022/i4v0zzm/,1650046719,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650017902.0

Lend-Lease was huge, and critical in enabling the Red Army to crush the Wehrmacht, but according to David Glantz, it wasn't a major factor in the Soviet War effort until after Stalingrad. Now there was other important aid before that, as Lend-Lease to Britain allowed them to aid the Soviets. I also think Western aid that came through was critical in allowing the Soviets to push their advantage from 1943 on, through things like trucks and food, preventing a stalemate.

Clearly Putin's plan was a blitzkrieg strike against Ukrainian leadership, the installation of a puppet government, and then the use of Russian troops as a show of force/pacification element while Ukraine came around to the idea of Russian rule.

But that didn't play out and, instead, Putin's invasion has done more to galvanize Ukranian national identity than pretty much any other event since the Holodomor.  

Now, maybe Russia can still pull this thing out.  The weight of numbers certainly seems to be on their side. Ukraine needs to have fantastic day after fantastic day to win out against the weight of the Russian military whereas the Russians just have to have average luck and a tolerance for bleeding a lot.  

But that can't be the focus for Putin anymore because wars are no longer just for territory.  For Ukraine to become part of Russia or a Russian vassal state, Putin needs the submission of the Ukrainian *people* and, since his decapitation strike failed, the invasion has made that dramatically LESS likely, not more likely. 

That then leaves two routes open to him.  ""Win their hearts and minds"" or ""crush the resistance out of them.""  I don't know on what basis Putin chose the second one but that's obviously the option he's going with.

And that explains the bomings, the shellings, the shootings, and -- yes -- the rapes.  Putin is trying to break the will of the Ukrainian people.  He's trying to beat a nation into submission so that it cringes rather than bristles when Russia barks orders at it.

And that... that is a harder thing to accomplish than just taking territory. The longer it drags on, however, and the more frustrated Russia becomes, the more overt, brutal, and horrific we can expect these atrocities to become as well.

In my non-expert opinion, the Ukrainians (MoD and others) has been fairly truthful in their affirmative statements, with a  few caveats:

* They seem happy to blur the line between KIA and Casualty for Russians. 
* They seem content to count any ""Hit"" as a KILL (esp. Aircraft) - some of these are probably killed sufficiently to leave the fight, but some can probably be patched up and sent back out on another sortie quickly.
* They seem to be sometimes blur the lines around civilian casualties, choosing, I suspect, to include some Territorial Defense fighters as civilians. Understandable as these people ARE civilians that have been forced to resist occupation. 


Where the MoD has been less truthful, I think specifically and understandably, has been on Ukrainian losses - and it is mainly lies of omission.

As we have seen very recently with the Russian warship Moskva, even large (12,490 tons in the Moskva's case) surface ships are vulnerable to anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM). We cannot know all the details of that incident yet, that might takes months or even years. Even though this article is very recent (April 6th 2022) it is of course before the Moskva incident.

But what we can do is to educate ourselves on the ASCM threat and what it means to the future of naval warfare. By having this background knowledge we will be better prepared to analyze the information released about the sinking of the Moskva when it does happen. 

This article is from the perspective of the Australian navy looking at the threat that China poses to its ships. It's focus is supposed to be ASCMs but it goes much farther than that in looking at Chinese underground hardening of military infrastructure, to proposed out the box thinking like unmanned arsenal ships, to the onboard number of defensive missiles on Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships that could counter these threats. 

It is interesting to read this report and to see warfare change slowly to being dominated by missile technology, and previous symbols of national prestige become liabilities as easy targets.

People say this, but isn't it clear that the accident story is so much worse?  Losing your flagship to enemy action is a bitter pill to swallow, but combat losses are a part of war.  Losing that same flagship to your own absurd incompetence is ... just sad.

They could ask the world to believe that they'd suffered a serious combat loss due to advanced Ukrainian weaponry, and yeah, the world would say ""good, slava Ukraini"" but few would actually be laughing at them.

Instead, they want the world to believe that they blew up their own flagship due to a whoopsie.  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`  That's *hilarious.*  It makes them look like utter buffoons.  Maybe we could relax the sanctions on crayons and colouring books and see if the Russians just stop showing up for battles.

In the case of Putin and the Russian Army, it was Anatoly Serdyukov who was primarily responsible for leading the effort to modernize the Russian Armed Forces from 2007 to 2012 attempted to faze out mass mobilization model first adopted by the Russian armed forces in 1870 in favor of a much smaller more professional force with no draft/conscripts at all. His reforms were touted as a massive success and new Russian equipment was paraded out for the world to see. Shoigu, an inoffensive Soviet hold out, replaced Serdyukov after he was caught in a corruption scandal (and power struggle) and claimed the glory that came with the success for the reforms. There was only one problem. [In a report published in 2019,](https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/3705.pdf) the US War College found that most of these reforms were uncompleted and then partially rolled back under Shoigu.

Kind of. He took steps to *include them* in NATO activities but also didn't let them outright join (for good reason imo). [There's a great Atlantic piece that Bill wrote that I recommend many read](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/bill-clinton-nato-expansion-ukraine/629499/). He goes into his thinking and thought process behind the NATO actions and other actions concerning Russia. 

&gt;I think we in the West have underestimated the trauma of the collapse of the USSR.

Agreed. Included here is the economic mismanagement of the 90's. 

I'm not acting like this hasn't been tried before nor that this will be effective, I just think that there's still *a chance*. Hopefully the West can learn from its past mistakes and not meddle as much within Russia while still doing what they can to pressure them (and invest) externally while not letting it collapse to 90s levels of oligarchical control. Definitely tough to pull off, but imo necessary for China containment policy. Letting half of Asia be ruled by 2 major(ish) US adversaries is not a recipe for success. The West needs to try to reset the relationship after this (if Putin is gone, he's not aligning with the West anytime soon).

They based their invasion plan on multiple faulty assumptions (that Zelensky would flee or be killed quickly, that Ukrainian citizens wanted to be ""liberated"" from their own government, that that the Ukrainian military wouldn't be able to/willing to put up stiff resistance, that they could end the war quickly enough to avoid serious fighting, that the West would sit on the sidelines, that Russia could weather sanctions easily, etc) and didn't plan for what would happen if any (let alone all) of those assumptions proved false. 

It's clear from the invasion plan itself, the fact that most Russian troops weren't informed of the invasion until they were rolling across the Ukrainian border, the clear lack of coordination and planning, the terrible logistics, and the lack of available manpower or a strategic reserve of reinforcements that Russian political calculations overrode practical military ones.

I'm still holding out hope that with regime change, there's a chance that Russia could still find a way to become closer to the West.

That power vacuum is going to be a huge, huge, opportunity for both the West and China to really fight to make his replacement someone that'll benefit the respective parties. Russia, culturally, is closer to the West, so there's a bit of an advantage there already, but right now the Russian populace might not be so high on becoming closer with the West. That's where blaming this entire fiasco on the Putin admin could come in handy, as well as a release of a trove of information about his lies could come in handy as well. The most concerning part of this imagined scenario, is who would come after the first new leader, as it could end up being a Putin 2.0 situation all over again.

[],False,,ritterteufeltod,,,[],,,,text,t2_8c4i7dmu,False,False,"So I wanted to bring up a kind of meta point, which is that the Ukrainian MoD briefings and official statements have been broadly accurate for the past 6 weeks. This includes:

-Casualty estimates that are getting closer and closer to Western Intel estimates
-Vehicle destruction estimates that are looking more plausible 
-Reports on daily fighting that are broadly correct if not complete.

Moreover, the picture that the MoD (and sources that use it like the ISW) is painting - that Ukraine is fighting and holding its own, inflictong greivous losses on the Russians, and indeed winning (inasmuch as it wins by not losing) - has been more accurate than many Western Media reports, which predicted imminent Ukrainian collapse, or even some Western analysts, who assumed that the Russians would start fighting smarter.

I think it is also revisiting what the bias of the Ukrainian MoD is. Why they say what they do. Or put another way, in what way might they be motivated to lie? First, we can expect the MoD to provide information to encourage Ukraine to fight on. If defeat was imminent we would thus expect them to be less accurate. But since defeat isn't imminent, we wouldn't expect the MoD to lie simply to keep people fighting. Would they be overly optimistic for other reasons, IE to give people the hope of imminent victory? I am not sure that motivation is there. Zelensky and his advisors like Oleksiy Arestovich have seemed to move their rhetoric more toward expecting a protracted war. And this makes sense. They know that either they will grind the Russian army down over months or the Russians will negotiate a settlement. In neither case does the Ukrainian government help itself but encouraging unrealistic optimism, because Ukrainians must be primed to accept either a longer war or a negotiated settlement that leaves Russia with the Donbas and Crimea. So in many ways the MoD has every reason to be realistic.

Finally, even with the fog of war, Ukraine is an open society - while Zelensky has clamped down on Pro Russian parties and consolidated media, Ukrainians still have access to other resources and their government can't just lie to them. More relevant, since this war is happening all around them, it is hard to conceal it's true nature from the Ukrainian people.",70168018a213f537d7197f4d40e79ccdb43221a0,True,False,,,,,0,1650030732,,0,{},i4tycsp,False,t3_u46gf9,False,True,t3_u46gf9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u46gf9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_15_2022/i4tycsp/,1650030743,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650001932.0

The $1mil price tag is absolutely a bullshit fanboy propaganda.

I would like to hear ab analysis comparing the two, the tb-2 might just be more effective for what Ukraine needs. But it's hard to take you seriously when you get basic facts wrong. The French deal for instance included **a lot** more than the drones:

&gt;According to a DSCA release the French government requests a ""possible sale"" of 16 MQ-9s along with eight mobile ground control stations (GCS) and 48 Honeywell TPE331-10T turboprop engines. Of the 48 engines, 16 would be installed while the remaining 32 are spares. France would also like to purchase 24 satellite terminal substations and 40 ground data terminals for the aircraft.

The Turkish sale to Ukraine has also included more than the drones and I do not claim they cost over $10 mil each, probably closer to $5-6 mil. But the scopes of the deals were incomparable first and foremost because tb-2 is a tactical drone and the support is built around that application.",e86a6c4e13abcb8b3a273ad41d3c6384f45edf2b,True,False,,,,,0,1650024072,,0,{},i4tlmd2,False,t3_u3fvip,False,True,t1_i4t5p7r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3fvip/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_14_2022/i4tlmd2/,1650024088,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649995272.0

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"In WWII, I kind of wonder what sort of ideological and power/authority delegation compromises Stalin was forced to make in order to gain an effective military force.

I almost wonder if the losses early in the war helped somewhat through the sheer attrition of corrupt and inept, albeit politically loyal, officers.  Combined with some kind of increased freedom to actually manage the military, Zhukov and others may have been able to upgrade the Soviet military with officers who were competent first, with ideological soundness and political loyalty somewhat lower on the totem pole.

I'd guess this may have had an effect that lingered through the first couple of decades after the war as well, with those post-'43 officers who won the Eastern front rising through the system and keeping the military capable.  But as they aged out, the old habits of corruption and the perverse incentives of political and ideological loyalty re-infected the Soviet military starting in the 1970s and worsening with the collapse of the Soviet union and the rise of Putin's dictatorship.

What this makes me wonder is whether or not Putin will be willing to make some of the possible compromises that Stalin made, and give a military leader the latitude to prioritize ability over political loyalty and curb corruption.  I suspect Putin probably personally feels that the war in Ukraine is as existentially important to Russia as Stalin knew WW II was to the Soviet Union.  The questions will be whether or not this makes it easier -- or harder -- for Putin to let a General do what needs to be done, or whether he will double down on micromanagement.  There's also the question whether Russia has enough time or resources to absorb the losses and advance a less corrupt and politically prioritized officer corps, or whether the attrition and resource constraints they face mean that the clock will run out.

I think there's also a potentially scary outcome that they do, and that Russia manages to achieve some kind of plausible victory because of wartime reforms, as well as emerging from the Ukraine conflict with a spiritually (if materially deficient) military force that's more dangerous because it has successfully managed to purge the worst abuses of corruption and incompetence.",a5c095fe0fd9988d80619aceef6093236b4f570b,True,False,,,,,0,1650022452,,0,{},i4tj3gh,False,t3_u3lee5,False,True,t1_i4s8zy6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3lee5/excerpts_from_an_economist_article_from_1854/i4tj3gh/,1650022469,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649993652.0

...it seems they draw an incorrect conclusion in claiming that ""liberalization and de-centralization"" will cure the Russian military of its woes.  What that permanent cure looks like exactly, who knows?  
\&gt;&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

DING-DING-DING!  Give that man a cookie.

Suggest instead, the opposite:

If you have limited cadre forces, then you dare not spread them too thin.

So bring your military to a central location and then guard it highly against corruption.  Ringing it with juxtaposed economists, strategists and logisticians.  So as to build forces you can afford and train them to competency in not just the attack but the maintenance of deployment capability.

You then assure that the core combatant training is provided the best of everything.  Food, medical, standards, rating systems, foreign instructors, familiarity with multiple weapons systems and environments.

Do not go with conscription to some training depot in the far boonies for to gain from the many a year's service is to come up a year short of fundamental competencies before contract end and two years short of advanced skill sets as due service in the specialty they are assigned.

Do not privatize your military.  For to do so is to beg the corruption of capitalism as now besets The West as well.  Where ops gets pennies and acquisition is king.  And there is no standardized budgetary reporting system, though Congress itself demanded it, from 1997 onwards.  People should hang in Leavenworth for that alone.

Instead make, for your enlisted, a West Point equivalent where, to gain entry, you must meet standards.  Psychological and Intellectual as well as Physical.  Elitism purchases envy.  Envy is the root of capability.  Because they want to be better than what they are now.

Make of their training an elite forging of a special metal.  Into a weapon not of the society they come from.  But better.

Give those who are willing to make a \_vocation\_ of their chosen field a contract which amounts to an initial career path, provided they understand that the majority of their time will be spent training others to do what they do.

Having said this, give them a useful and challenging \_rotation\_ of duty stations so that none are condemned by their initial garrison and all bad apples are noted by new barrels for the source of their rot in time to be 'evaluated' (before the mast) and severed from the community if they fail to stabilize their vector and meet the trajectory norm.

This will allow you to identify, isolate and flood bad duty stations like a brotherhood of Hercules, tackling the Augean Stables.  Washing them clean before sending fresh CO/NCO cadre to begin again.

Missionize your people that they might have deployments to out-of-area requested allies where their mettle as skills are tested in local battles.  Host exercises with allies which allow foreign ideas to at least filter through the intermediaries of an India or China.  There should be a major exercise area for each branch, equivalent to our NTC and Northern Edge battlespaces.  Where the best teach and range test the rest, the most secret tricks of their art of war.

You want to encourage these people to have decent home lives as a career commitment to the military which means building housing and schools and medical in specific communities which they can come home to as a centralized, affordable, commitment to a warfighter domesticity maintenance effort.  A man who has a family and a low mortgage/rent quality home wants the paycheck.  That doesn't mean he's a bad soldier.  It means he is a settled one.  Again, with strict oversight.  Deploy for four months, come home for two.  It should not be luxurious but it should be nicer than anything they have prior-known.  Kid schools, pools, riding, biking, movies, medical, libraries, free internet, external career or job field transfer training (infantry to automotive for instance). 

The method of governance matters little, compared to the security of oversight as separate administration.  It is when you send lone emissaries to the wilderness that things go pear shaped.  As local rules and hierarchies develop in regional commands and the fresh meat either go native, are kept from see anything or get dead.

To change this is to change the nature of oversight.  Bring the pups to one litter, guard that basket and raise from them genuine wolves of war.  Polite to all, trusting of none, always with a plan to kill everyone in the room.

You start with a robust NCO class.  That's going to take you a decade at least.  You let the FSB filter your officer class.  And then you blend the two together.  So that the errors of political correctness and corrupt buyout 'mistakes' of selection by the securitat can be immediately offset by a sergeant's hard eye to the person beneath the braided cap.

If there is friction of the inept leading the incompetent, now is the time to catch it and adjust the mix.

Once you have seasoned officer/NCO staffs, you begin to bring in your first wave of recruits.  Two years later, you deploy them to the field and essentially take over or even build-new garrison facilities.  Operating in parallel to existing units as they gain their spurs.

Which should be easy enough, when you realize that 10+2+2 = 14 years, so that most of today's SV military, realizing they are too old for field duty and being excluded from the new moral military club, politically, will be looking for an easy out retirement package.

Which you give, to get them out of the uniform.

And you just keep doing this and doing this and doing this as you fill up foreign CIS garrisons with new formations.  Gapping some, low stress, duty stations for a few months of a year to allow added force deployments to Terrorstans as an example.  But with everyone making 2-3 year rotations to new duty stations overall.  Like combat theater deployments.  Always on a Four out, Two home basis.

Always psychologically, intellectually and physically monitored between deployment and recovery to new-skills and pre-deployment training again.",67347c3630188889c46dd36e88b0f86cc2116208,True,False,,,,,0,1650019522,,0,{},i4tey46,False,t3_u3lee5,False,True,t1_i4s8zy6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3lee5/excerpts_from_an_economist_article_from_1854/i4tey46/,1650019537,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649990722.0

Using chemical weapons to kill a city of 1 million is like trying to kill the all sharks in the Atlantic ocean by posioning the ocean. The ocean is really big and it'd gonna just dissipate unless you use more chemical weapons than exist on the Earth combined.

The efficacy of Russian army seems to be unpredictable and even in a way cyclical.   

Is it a top-down phenomenon perhaps linked to autocracy? Does poor discipline and general incompetence (logistics foremost there) 'trickle down' from a corrupt officer corps to the conscripts, rendering all (or most) unable/unwilling/untrained to perform their designated functions. That would go a long way in explain the difference between expected capability and realized strength. How effective have anti-corruption campaigns been? Or is it maybe a bottom-up issue instead?

Vietnam is brought up, but the US is no Cambodia. Even at the height of the war the US refrained from even bombing North Vietnam anywhere near the Chinese border. The North Vietnamese concentrated much of their logistics and industry in that part because it was completely safe.

&gt;As I assumed earlier, the operation was carried out in full cooperation of the Ukrainian Navy with the Allied forces: for example, according to airspace monitoring data for April 12, the British RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft was actively operating in the Black Sea area, and RQ UAV flights were also recorded at different times RQ-4 Global Hawk (map included). On that day, NATO intelligence confirmed the presence of the Moscow, verified the signatures, and received comprehensive data on the whereabouts of other ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation.

[],False,,sadhukar,,,[],,,,text,t2_amudz,False,False,"I've been coming to the opposite conclusion. Biden *initially* seems genuinely apathetic to the plight of the Ukrainians. I guessed that his own defeats in his domestic agenda were weighing on him, Ukraine being a distraction to the SCOTUS nominee, the upcoming state of the union which he needs to go well in order not to completely bomb the midterms, and his ongoing disputes with Sinema and Manchin. That is, if Ukraine fell in 3 days as expected.

I don't think such an analysis is too farfetched. Biden is a liberal dove; he's completely apathetic to Afghanistan and essentially gave it to the Taliban, even going so far as to prevent the DoD from garrisoning troops at Kabul Airport in order to facilitate the evacuation. As VP, he opposed Obama's airstrikes in Libya and successfully stopped his president from escalating in Syria.

But I think [Blinken, his State Department](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/first-part-200-mln-us-defence-aid-arrives-ukraine-2022-01-22/) and the [CIA disagreed with the approach](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3447200-early-this-year-us-gave-ukraine-crucial-intelligence-on-russias-intentions-that-helped-kyiv-in-first-days-of-war-wsj.html). Their hands were tied though, they couldn't do much more than give the Ukrainians some javelins and intelligence (which, as we can see, actually did alot). [Biden even went as far as demanding the CIA delay sharing intelligence to the Ukrainians by an hour](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ukraine-russia-white-house-washington-director-of-national-intelligence-b2028913.html) so it can't be classified as 'real time intelligence'. 

The point being, I think contrary to what you are saying, Biden was doing his utmost to make the conflict look like it ISN'T NATO. He simply does not want to embroil the US in another foreign conflict and wants to concentrate on domestic issues.

What changed, in my opinion, was that 1) his visit to the Ukrainian refugee camp on the Polish border, and 2) bipartisan support in helping Ukraine.

The buoyancy aspect was something I was not expecting and I wonder if this has been studied for use with amphibious vehicles. The troubled AAV comes to mind specifically. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_Amphibious_Vehicle

Some technology moves fast and some slow, but few people seem to understand that tire technology is advancing at a steady pace with tires today being significantly superior to those of ten or twenty years ago. This track technology seems to be moving at the same pace and the few downsides of heat due to weight is something that I am confident will be worked out.

Given the many benefits and the fact that the rubber track technology is improving at a steady pace, it would seem to be logical that the US and other users of tracked vehicles would invest in the industry to push the tech forward. A competitive industry doing research and testing would help to make move along much faster than a single company. With the tech being able to save as much fuel and maintenance as high dollar systems like hybrid powertrains it would appear to be a sound investment.

Introduction:

&gt; Composite Rubber Track (CRT) is a relatively new method of manufacturing tracks, replacing segmented steel track assemblies with a single continuous 'band' of rubber track, made from a complex composite structure to withstand the tremendous forces involved. Its a remarkable bit of technology and a serious step change for tracked vehicles, bringing with it a range of huge benefits, and has very few drawbacks.

Key Takeaways

The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet sunk on April 14 following a likely Ukrainian cruise missile strike on April 13. The loss of the Moskva is a significant propaganda victory for Ukraine but will likely have only limited effects on Russian operations.

Ukrainian officials admitted Russian forces captured “some” personnel from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade in Mariupol despite initial denials, though Ukrainian defenders predominantly continued to hold out against Russian assaults.

Russian forces may have committed damaged units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to combat operations in eastern Ukraine for the first time on April 14. Continued daily Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine are failing to take any territory.

Ukrainian partisans have likely been active in the Melitopol region since at least mid-March.

If you look at the states that tried to aquire nuclear weapons in the past, those were often pariah states that would become the target of diplomatic and economic sanctions anyway. South Africa, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya. Therefore this kind of sanctions won't be able to get those states to abstain from developing nukes in a reliable fashion. 

Besides that the west made some huge mistakes when dealing with potential nuclear powers. Ukraine agreed to give up its nukes (as far as I know they weren't actually able to use this nukes at that point, so I think they count as ""potential nuclear power"") for diplomatic guarantees that proved worthless. Libya gave up its nuclear program in 2003, 8 years later NATO intervened in the Libyan Civil War. Iraq gave up its nuclear weapon program and was invaded. All this makes it very hard to convince any potential nuclear power that giving up those programs for any kind of diplomatic agreement is a viable option.

How to Win the Battle in Eastern Ukraine

https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-win-battle-eastern-ukraine

Russian forces are positioning themselves for a large “cauldron battle” in eastern Ukraine designed to shatter the Ukrainian army and gain terrain to use as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table. Kyiv has a limited window of opportunity to conduct a series of localized counterattacks that limit Russia’s ability to encircle the Ukrainian armed forces.

In military theory, a cauldron battle is an operational maneuver to surround the enemy on at least three sides. The idea comes from the German kesselschlacht, in which the goal is to force the enemy into a self-defeating battle of annihilation, surrender, or retreat along a narrow front ceding territory to the attacking force. The maneuver is a variation of a pincer movement, or double envelopment, in which an advancing force attacks both flanks of the defender.

Despite its German origins, the maneuver has long been used by Russian forces. In Russian military history, the classic example of a cauldron battle is Stalingrad, where the Soviets encircled the German Sixth Army in November 1942. More recently, the Russians executed a cauldron battle in the Battle of Debaltseve in 2015 during the hybrid fighting in the Donbas region that followed Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

The best way to defeat the Russians in a cauldron battle is for Ukraine to deny encirclement. First, Ukrainian forces could launch a series of spoiling attacks that prevent Russia from building up forces. While large-scale spoiling attacks are risky, smaller “hit-and-run ambushes” alongside sabotage by Ukrainian special forces between Kharkiv and Izyum are sustainable and pull Russian forces away from the front.

Second, the Ukrainian forces could transition from defensive war, which is subject to negative aims and denying an adversary an objective, to offensive action. While Ukrainian forces maintain a series of fortified fighting positions in the east, they will have to absorb large-scale combined arms assaults by Russian forces. These fighting positions could act as surfaces—strong points—that fix an advance and create opportunities for Ukrainian forces to counterattack Russia’s assailable flanks. These flanking attacks could even produce new “cauldrons,” in which low morale among the Russian army cascades into large-scale surrenders and combat losses.

For Ukraine to break the siege of its cities and a war of attrition that is already destroying its economy and displacing millions, Kyiv needs to explore how to break the Russian army. Winning the coming cauldron battle presents a near-term opportunity.

[],False,,Solubilityisfun,,,[],,,,text,t2_su9cy,False,False,"I can't tell the actual model in question here, but as a general point, there tends to be more vulnerable spots even on the front of most tanks than the peak of the upper glacis or turret cheeks (usually greatest armor thickness on a given tank). A 30mm autocannon puts out a large enough volume of fire that a lucky shot finding a vulnerable spot is not impossible. 

Modern sub caliber fin stabilized discarding sabot rounds can produce more penetration than you might expect for a small diameter round like the 30mm. Its basically a 30mm shell with slightly more room for charge and a smaller penetrator. So they achieve both higher velocity and have a more focused/concentrated impact which provides greater efficiency/energy transfer. Those sort of rounds certainly can cause issues on those weaker points of a tank. 

Still, luck is involved.

The camera is too far out to tell exactly what happened. Maybe someone has a specific theory in this case.
