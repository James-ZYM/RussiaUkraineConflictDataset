There was an alliance in the past with 13 groups asking for federalization. However, it broke apart due to a lack of communication, and some members got kicked, while others left. The chances of those groups fighting amongst themselves are low, they all have their own defined territory with no territorial conflicts. I think the saying, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" works well here. It's a mutual understanding not to attack the other.

This leads me to believe their ability to communicate with one another is lacking. This is probably why so many local resistance groups sprung up instead of joining the existing forces.

I think a plan C, if they figure out that it will be impossible or too expensive to take the dombas, will be the ugly one: destroy as much as they can, then go back home claiming victory and showing the destruction they caused as a clear evidence that their enemy was defeated and there's no more need to fight.

It’s one of those things they by the time your brain processes it, impact happens. Even after impact rational thinking doesn’t return until a minute or 4 in. I know anytime a situation happens (even death experiences like the Orlando ride a few weeks back) people online complain and say things like “why are people standing around” “why isn’t anyone reacting” etc… 

Shock is a bitch on the body. All I remember being apart of something like this was after the fact, checking my teeth. My face/mouth area slammed into the seat right in front of me. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is the damage” or “am I hurt” or “how is everyone else”.

Family oil wealth was a secondary affair. Cheney was motivated by Halliburton shares. Rumsfeld may have been hoping it would secure the US a reliable ally or a puppet which could help against Iran. And oil lobbyists gave every politician taking their money a reason to be for the war. Then Fox and other media outlets pushed enough misleading hints that a large part of the public attributed 9/11 to Iraq. After that the handful of voices against the war were instantly drowned out.

So while profit was a motive, it was one motive among many. Also one of the most important differences between Iraq and other wars is -despite the overall disaster the war kicked off- US soldiers were largely highly professional. And in the instances in which soldiers did become lawless, the US held the soldiers accountable. Dale Green was serving life in prison until he committed suicide in 2014.

But I would never think that way if I was from Ukraine nor I think that way while being from Italy.

The mistake, imo, is thinking that dealing with Putin and so accepting that he'll conquest another part of Ukraine will end in a more peaceful result compared to the scenario were Ukraine will keep fighting.

This is what mearsheimer keep saying, which translated sounds like: ""if you're assaulted by someone, it's better to surrender in order to avoid more damages"".

Never ended uo in war yet. And I definitely don't want to try my luck over something as stupid as this.

No, they just didn't give a shit. The US bombed both Korea and Vietnam into the stone age, in Vietnam they even used chemical weapons, high ""collateral damage"" has never been a problem.

Except Russians aren't just going to pack their bags, apologize and return home. They'll likely lob a couple of hundred more missiles, this time aimed to cause as much damage to Ukraine's infrastructure as possible.

Also Russian leadership isn't viewing this as an optional overseas adventure. It's very likely Putin and people around him truly believe they had no choice but to attack. Invasion is going badly, mostly because of how it was carried out (not enough troops, not prepared for resistance, etc.), but they probably disagree with the implementation rather than concept.

If Tu-22M approaches Mariupol from Sea of Azov, drops payload and immediately turns back, the closest Ukraine-controlled territory is 75km away. Last time I checked Wikipedia's page on Ukraine's air defense, it said Ukraine had S-300PT/PS and that one has a max range of 90km. They would have to keep S-300 radar in Russia's artillery range.

&gt;Strategic bombers are just a no-go right now,

I'm not sure we're even disagreeing - yes, given Ukraine's air defenses are still functioning sending strategic bombers in area they cover would end very badly for Russians.

We don't know yet Ukraine army losses in terms of troops casualties and military equipment and it's definitely possible their losses match Russian ones. 

But as I said there's a misconception: many people are wondering how it's possible for a country to claim victory despite having it's territory devastated (while its enemy had basically zero territory damages) and despite having (probably) both armies having the same amount of losses.

Many users here and in other sub used this argument: 

""*who's winning? Russia is winning. They're invading Ukraine, destroying their cities while getting zero damages to their territory and their cities. So they're clearly winning*""

You can't claim victory if you can't achieve your goal. 

Russia is getting closer and closer to reach a point were achieving even a limited version of its initial goal will be impossible.

And for those wondering, yes, you can lose a war despite having zero damages in your own territory and despite having half of the casualties of your opponent (and this is not even that case).

Soviet war in afghanistan was just an example. 

Russian cities never saw any attack of course and overall soviet alliance had HALF of the casualties of their opponent. They still lost that war. Not as bad as it happened in early 1900's war vs Japan, but still a loss.

And even in the Russo-Japanese war started to control Manchuria, Japanese army had way more casualties and still won that war.

So Russia already lost his chances to achieve its main goal and now will struggle to obtain a minimal result in order to turn it into a victory.

4017.0,[],False,,Ratdog98,,,[],,,,text,t2_gp05b,False,False,"While I don't doubt the credibility of your source, I don't think it's quite so easy to just disregard the effect of the atomic weapons and to potentially overplay the effect of the Soviet declaration of war against the Japanese Empire. I'm not a historian or anything, just for transparency's sake.

From a logical perspective, the Soviet Union posed very little threat to Japan proper. While their colonials possessions outside the home islands in mainland China would almost certainly be at risk, the Soviet Navy was hardly in a position to launch a major seaborne offensive against Japan itself. I can't find a super authoritative source on the total vessels of the navy, [but this website does appear to list nearly every ship in the Soviet Navy](https://uboat.net/allies/warships/navy/USSR.html); regardless of the actual numbers, a key component missing is any apparent ships which could be utilized for landing troops and heavy equipment. I couldn't find anything which indicated, either, that the rest of the allies expected the Soviets to take part in a hypothetical invasion of Japan such as Operation Downfall -- realistically speaking, they had no capabilities with which to join in. The Soviets seem to have considered attempting their own invasion of Hokkaido but on a substantially smaller scale and with much less resources than would have been necessary to support the main offensive against the other of the home islands.

All of this is purely conjectural. What we do know is that *even after* the declaration of war by the atomic bombs were dropped and the Soviets declared war, a large portion of the Japanese military still refused any option of surrender. [They were perfectly willing to overthrow the Japanese government in the Kyujo Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABj%C5%8D_incident) (Wikipedia used for expediency, but I'm sure you can find more reputable explanations of it) in the week after. The Japanese government was intensely split over whether or not to surrender despite everything that had happened so far, and, if any one of those major things had not happened, is it not impossible to think that there might have been even *greater* sentiment against the Emperor and surrender?

You're exactly right that, on a numbers scale, the damage caused by the atomic bombs wasn't that different than the Tokyo firebombing and other potential problems. However, the sheer scale of the attack caused by a single weapon is what makes it have such a lasting impression; there isn't really anything the Japanese could do to counter the weapon if it was used on Kyoto or Tokyo beyond hoping they could shoot down a lone bomber. I think the source you use (Ward Wilson?) might be discounting the effect that the *means* of that destruction being levied a bit.

Nobody should doubt that the entry of the Soviet Union into the war played a factor into the considerations of the Japanese, but one shouldn't downplay the potential impact that a weapon which could be extremely hard to combat and devastating could have upon an already surrounded, cut-off nation. If that threat of total destruction from atomic weapons didn't exist, and the Japanese military still nearly overthrew the government, how would have that gone if that threat wasn't looming over their heads? If it wasn't for members of the military still loyal to the Emperor like Toroshiro, it is improbable that things might have turned out differently? I'm not sure anyone can rightly answer that, but I think it's impossible to say that the potential of destruction from the atomic bombs wasn't a serious factor at all in inducing the Japanese to their near-unconditional surrender.

The matter seems to be extremely heavily debated in academia, no matter what has been said by either of us, so it's clear -- at the very least -- that people more knowledgeable than I don't seem convinced toward one way or the other.",5c1f10d39325408b34a57c0af54f69fbd3a7c7bf,True,False,,,,,0,1650056739,,0,{},i4vodqg,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4v61ju,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4vodqg/,1650056753,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650027939.0,,,,

Find me a single 60 year old officer who lived that long. Eisenhower died in 1969, Truman died 3 years later, Patton died a few months after the war. That line of thinking is just plain stupid.

The bombs were unnecessary, this isn't my opinion, this is the opinion of the men who made the decision. The Japanese were broken, and the Soviets entry into the war against Japan was what broke them. They were already discussing surrendering to the US when the Japanese High Command received word of the first bombing. These are not my opinions, these are the historical facts. 

No single bombing was as devastating as the Tokyo Firebombing, 65 Japanese Cities had already been destroyed by American bombing raids. What was another massive bomb to a country that had already been bombed to oblivion? The answer is very little. The Japanese chose to blame the atomic bombing because losing to a revolutionary, horrific new technology was more honorable than the alternative.

The Japanese had hoped to use the Soviets to mediate their conditional surrender to the world, Chinese, and British. This has been confirmed by documents from the period. The White House wanted Stalin to enter the war in the Pacific as early as 1944, but the Japanese believed they wouldn't be a threat, at least until after the war ended. When the Soviets invaded Manchuria in a surprise move, it dashed any hopes the Japanese had of a conditional surrender, and the Emperor himself pleaded with the Japanese High Command to end the war on the 8th of August. [src](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-declare-war-on-japan-invade-manchuria) 

It was not the bombs that ended the war, the only reason anyone believes that anymore is because American history education teaches propaganda rather than historical fact.

Insofar as whether the bombs were the deciding factor in forcing the Japanese surrender, they were not. They were unnecessary in forcing their surrender. The only thing that the bombs did was intimidate the Soviets and push them to develop their own nuclear weapons.",34a671453b7a3f93f5d4fc6fdc4a9b8717738e81,True,False,,,,,0,1650056173,,0,{},i4vn43x,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4vi9e5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4vn43x/,1650056189,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650027373.0,,,,

&gt; Citing a written stipulation of facts submitted by Marine Staff Sgt. Kevin Maxwell — one of four charged in Melgar's death — LaMothe reported that after the group burst into Melgar's bedroom with a sledgehammer, they planned to have a Malian security guard sexually assault him while an unnamed British special operator recorded it.

&gt; The plan to enter the Green Beret's room was part of an attempt to “embarrass” and haze him for what happened the prior evening, when Melgar left two Marines he was supposed to escort in an unknown part of Bamako, Navy SEAL Chief Adam Matthews testified.

https://taskandpurpose.com/news/melgar-assault-mali-camera/

&gt; Former Special Forces Chief Warrant Officer 3 J.P. Cervantes, a Melgar family spokesman, first described the alleged incident in a May 11 Instagram post that alleged Matthews was attending a costume party dressed as Rambo when he approached Michelle Melgar using the false name “Mike.”

&gt; “Once he realized who she was, he was trying to vouch for the '2 guys' of the team who killed Logan, saying they are his best friends, are really good guys, and she should try to help them,” Cervantes wrote. “Then saying: 'If you would just sit down and have a conversation with the two guys who did this, you would love them. They're really not bad people. This has ruined their lives and careers.”

&gt; Matthews allegedly texted Michelle the next day asking if he could take a nap in her room, but she refused, Cervantes wrote. She only learned who Matthews really was when she later saw pictures of the service members accused of killing her husband.

At 550mph, that's about 51 seconds between detection and impact... and rumors were, the Moskva had trouble tracking multiple objects at once due to some repairs or retrofits.

Depending on how far off the water the missile and the ship's radar were, they probably had something around 1 minute from earliest possible detection to impact. Could be a bit more or a bit less, and supposedly poor weather impacted that too. 

I heard one person say the Ukrainians fired the missiles blind and only activated their own targeting last-minute, which would have been another way to detect them. They supposedly knew the location of the ship by its previous predictable maneuvers.

More accurately, it would be like if someone murdered my family member so I tracked down an random family member of theirs and killed them as revenge.

We don't know about this specific case.  It's pretty extreme, and as a result I tend to believe this particular Russian was indeed involved in something that directly impacted this Ukrainian (moreso than simply being an invader) but maybe not.  

I understand every Russian soldier isn't a gibbering monster.  I'd guess many just want to go home.  

But they're still there.  They are invading another country. They are murdering those civilians, destroying homes, businesses, families.

As an invader, you are putting yourself in a situation where you are straight up in the wrong and by a large margin.  

Ganger Bob breaks into my house, rapes and kills my wife.

Ganger Joe breaks into my work, kills my coworkers.

When Ganger Frank, wearing the same gang colors breaks into my house after that?  I'm fucking him up.  It's wrong, sure.  Maybe he just wanted to steal my TV.  Maybe he doesn't want to be part of that gang, but has no good way out.  

He's still acting as a part of a group who's committed atrocities against me and mine.  He still made the choice to break into my house.  Whether he had good options doesn't matter.

Its not about Russian war crimes.  You invade a country, and it's denizens are now defending themselves.

Self defense, defense of your home and country, *is not the same* as fighting as an aggressor in another country.  

As a defender in your home, there is MUCH more leeway.  

I guarantee if China's somehow successfully invaded the US, was laying siege to American cities in similar situations as Mariupol?  Really fucking bad things would happen to Chinese soldiers captured.

4710.0,[],False,,AFirefighter11,,,[],,,,text,t2_1r23o3qy,False,False,"The ""real history"" taught outside the US seems to show that we did not need to drop either of those bombs. Japan was already willing to surrender as the US was attacking from one front and the Soviets from another. 

One source: ""Nuclear weapons shocked Japan into surrendering at the end of World War II—except they didn’t. Japan surrendered because the Soviet Union entered the war. Japanese leaders said the bomb forced them to surrender because it was less embarrassing to say they had been defeated by a miracle weapon. Americans wanted to believe it, and the myth of nuclear weapons was born.  
Look at the facts. The United States bombed 68 cities in the summer of 1945. If you graph the number of people killed in all 68 of those attacks, you imagine that Hiroshima is off the charts, because that’s the way it’s usually presented. In fact, Hiroshima is second. Tokyo, a conventional attack, is first in the number killed. If you graph the number of square miles destroyed, Hiroshima is sixth. If you graph the percentage of the city destroyed, Hiroshima is 17th.  
Clearly, in terms of the end result—I’m not talking about the means, but in terms of the outcome of the attack—Hiroshima was not exceptional. It was not outside the parameters of attacks that had been going on all summer long. Hiroshima was not militarily decisive.  
The Soviet Union’s declaration of war, on the other hand, fundamentally altered the strategic situation. Adding another great power to the war created insoluble military problems for Japan’s leaders. It might be possible to fight against one great power attacking from one direction, but anyone could see that Japan couldn’t defend against two great powers attacking from two different directions at once.  
The Soviet declaration of war was decisive; Hiroshima was not.  
After Hiroshima, soldiers were still dug in in the beaches. They were still ready to fight. They wanted to fight. There was one fewer city behind them, but they had been losing cities all summer long, at the rate of one every other day, on average. Hiroshima was not a decisive military event. The Soviet entry into the war was.  
And they said this. Japan’s leaders identified the Soviet Union as the strategically decisive factor. In a meeting of the Supreme Council in June to discuss the war in general, policy, they said Soviet entry would determine the fate of the empire. Kawabe Toroshiro said, ""The absolute maintenance of peace in our relations with the Soviet Union is one of the fundamental conditions for continuing the war.""  
Japan’s leaders said Hiroshima forced them to surrender because it made a terrific explanation for losing the war. But the facts show that Hiroshima did not force Japan to surrender.  
If nuclear weapons are a religion, Hiroshima is the first miracle. What do we make of a religion when its miracles turn out to be false? Nuclear weapons shocked Japan into surrendering in World War II—except they didn’t.""",8067b77f38b9f7b6676e6ac7c5dd3eb93dba9b9c,True,False,,,,,0,1650048782,,0,{},i4v61ju,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4sz3uc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4v61ju/,1650048797,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650019982.0,,,,

This is incorrect. I was replying to this:

&gt; The inherited phycological need of most humans to belong, to follow, to believe in an ""explanation"" that makes them feel better about the inexplicable and the horrific world.

Original sin is religion's way of ""explanation"" and indoctrinating those that would be able to make sense of ""the horrific world"" with science, before they get a chance to do so.. Paying money to the church is the way out of original sin.

For your edification, since you seem ignorant as well:
[Original sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin)

&gt; Original sin is the Christian doctrine that holds that humans, through the fact of birth, inherit a tainted nature in need of regeneration and a proclivity to sinful conduct

and

&gt; Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin equated original sin with concupiscence (or ""hurtful desire""), affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom to do good, proposing that original sin involved a loss of free will except to sin.

Not sure why you think I'm being aggressive? Those are just the facts. Unless you are one of those people that gets angry at facts that don't align with your worldview.

&gt; Religion did not get born out of the ether, it was an evolutionary advantage we evolved as a species.

Citation needed on ""advantage"". Religion is a meme, a virus of an idea. It's widely accepted that civilization would be much further progressed except for the mental chokehold that religion had for centuries on thought that would allow our species to advance.

&gt; It is the original ""glue"" that made a bunch of disparate tribes act cohesively and care about people outside their immediate tribes.

No, it is not. Humans were able to work together without religion just fine in multiple places around the earth. Now I see, you are pushing an agenda.

&gt; That doesn't make it ""good"", nor does it make it ""right""-- it's just scientific fact that religion served an evolutionary purpose of societal &amp; community cohesion for our species.

Citation needed again. Again, it's widely accepted that religion DELAYED civilization's advancement, not helped it.",48158540c05edda7970a9eb252ca12afda01962d,True,False,,,,,0,1650048015,,0,{},i4v474p,False,t3_u480x4,False,True,t1_i4uqwl3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u480x4/ukrainian_soldiers_firing_artillery_and_shouting/i4v474p/,1650048027,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650019215.0,,,,

However, the full story is so much worse. 

&gt;While performing, Dead would often cut himself with hunting knives and broken glass. Additionally, the band often had pig or sheep heads impaled on stakes and planted at the front of their stage.

&gt;[...] Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun. [Varg Vikernes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes) claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.

&gt;On 8 April 1991, Dead committed [suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide) in the house rented by the band. He was found by Euronymous with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's suicide note started with the sentence **""Excuse all the blood""** and included a brief explanation ""nobody will ever understand this, but as a sort of explanation, I am not human, this is only a dream and soon I will awake"". [...]  **When Euronymous found all this, he went to a nearby store and bought a disposable camera to photograph the corpse, after re-arranging some items.**

&gt;[Euronymous] called me up the next day ... and says, ""Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself"". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, ""Relax, I have photos of everything"".

&gt;**In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull.** The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård 'Faust' Eithun and Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen. In 2018, a fragment of Dead's skull also went on sale for $3,500, along with the letter from Euronymous that it was posted with.

Mayhem Bass guitar player Necrobutcher then planned to murder Euronymous. However, he was beat to it by fellow Black Metal musician, neo nazi, and church arsonist Varg Vikernes who ambushed Euronymous in his apartment and stabbed him 23 times in ""self defense"" because Euronymous had allegedly ""plotted to stun him with an
electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event.""",118d3363c88239822306ffc0d78acea00ab2310a,True,False,,,,,0,1650047148,,0,{},i4v23nh,False,t3_u4cyj6,False,True,t1_i4ux2pq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4cyj6/remnants_of_a_russian_mbt/i4v23nh/,1650047162,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650018348.0,,,,

Sure, roast the chechens and wagner and all of those clowns, but understand that within the russian ranks, there are absolutely people who just want to fucking go home.",66cfca79eced6a0d51328287a46700c163aab162,True,False,,,,,0,1650046265,,0,{},i4uzxw3,False,t3_u430jc,False,True,t1_i4uy5og,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u430jc/russian_air_defense_over_belgorod_regionrussia/i4uzxw3/,1650046283,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650017465.0,,,,

You equip some of them with explosives to target military targets, make them question every time they see another one on radar if it’s carrying explosives. 

It would need to take a bit of engineering, but you could also increase the radar cross section of the drone to make it look bigger. Maybe stick lightweight material on it to give it ‘wings’ make it look like a bigger payload carrying drone. Might work might not, but the whole point of the tactic would be to seed doubt into the radar operators. 

Another thing that could work would be a drone swarm. Get 100 cheap drones, and fly them in a massive swarm towards enemy air defence. Maybe supplement it by sending small amounts of ordinance equipped drones prior to make sure they know the things can carry explosives, then send a swarm.

Highly doubtful. Ukraine isn’t going to someday launch a counter-attack and drive through Russian held territory. Their objective is to hold what they have at this point.

Compare and contrast to previous footage of MLRS strike impacts and TU-22 strike impacts and you’ll see they are clearly iron dropped bombs from a strategic bomber.",b9aada11b546a9a8b66880aaebf1af5d8a0b2193,True,False,,,,,0,1650044480,,0,{},i4uvjva,True,t3_u4d2uu,False,True,t1_i4utkmh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4d2uu/russian_strategic_tu22_backfire_carpet/i4uvjva/,1650044496,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650015680.0,,,,

Why are you being so aggressive over this? Take a step back and breathe, I mean that, no one is getting at you, and this response has literally nothing to do with what the quoted portion you're replying to was saying.

Religion did not get born out of the ether, it was an evolutionary advantage we **evolved** as a species. It is the original ""glue"" that made a bunch of disparate tribes act cohesively and care about people outside their immediate family, even if in selfish ways. That doesn't make it ""good"", nor does it make it ""right""-- it's just a scientific fact though that religion served an evolutionary purpose of societal &amp; community cohesion for our species. 

Just like any other animal, we have instinct, and humans have evolved the an inherent psychological need to feel wanted, accepted in the community, and to pursue things (like religion, or nationalism, or whatever else) to bind them to communities. It's as inherent to us as any other biological inherited trait.

We are moving on from ""tribal animals"" as we evolve (both physically, intellectually, and morally). That includes moving on from religion's stranglehold on the weak-minded who insist on staying in that tribal form.

&gt; The inherited phycological need of most humans to belong, to follow, to believe in an ""explanation"" that makes them feel better about the inexplicable and the horrific world.

Have you heard of original sin? Perhaps you would also like to know that you can live forever if you but tithe 10% of your earnings to the church.

Regardless, the need to explain the unknown no longer needs an invisible friend in the sky. Religion still poisons everything it touches.",99400f60fedc8aa7b68598cf44ea14aa087a6a09,True,False,,,,,0,1650042173,,0,{},i4ups0m,False,t3_u480x4,False,True,t1_i4ulsdz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u480x4/ukrainian_soldiers_firing_artillery_and_shouting/i4ups0m/,1650042186,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650013373.0,,,,

The concussion and shrapnel travel out from the impact so it doesn't really travel downwards. Trying to outrun the artillery results in potentially getting hit by shrapnel which can fly hundreds of meters with enough energy to destroy a light vehicle.

Secondly, there's a whole bunch of patterns that make it hard to guess when it's safe to run. It might be one shot, pause to adjust, one shot, pause to adjust, etc. It might be one shot, adjust before impact, fire two shells in rapid succession, etc. 

If there's an artillery battery, they'll have six guns ready to go (I think that's the US doctrine). Spotter will give a location usually backed by a GPS, the fire direction center will calculate the angles, then all cannons will begin firing in succession. As each one is adjusting the others are already firing and reloading. They all take turns walking in and don't give the target any time to react.

However, his timetable advanced and he didn't need the Palua islands so told Nimitz about two weeks before the Peleliu landing was scheduled that it would be fine to cancel it. But Nimitz decided to go ahead with the landing anyway since all units were at sea and already committed to the operation according to their planning timetables. 

The pre-invasion intelligence estimation about Peleliu was GROSSLY off. USMC and USN planners underestimated the number of defenders and the planning had been done while contemplating how the IJA fought in previous campaigns against the 1st Marine Division (the principle assault force), and not taking into consideration the recent switch in tactics to a defensive focused porcupine defense. 

The 1st MarDiv CG especially, who micromanaged the planning and execution, believed the operation would take three days and that's what he told everyone who listened (despite no pressure on him from his corps commander, the amphibious fleet commander, or the Pacific fleet commander). He envisioned the first day to consist of a bloody assault at the water's edge, after which the Japanese would try to counterattack the landing and fail. And then the remnants would sacrifice themselves in Banzai attacks to die with honor. 

Instead the IJA used the same template as the defense from the Saipan operation that occurred months earlier (which 1st MarDiv had not participated in or analyzed) and fought from fixed defenses, dug deep and in depth, designed to attrit the attackers as much as possible while knowing all the defenders were going to die in the process, so no hope of actual victory.  

While they did defend the landing beaches (worse then anticipated), the inland defenses were even worse. Time schedules and progress were off from the first day and the 1st MarDiv pressured his regimental commanders to hurry up and clear the island, as he still refused to consider his plan was based on bullshit. Far inland they ran into a mountain range that was honeycombed with tunnels and fighting positions, defended by interlocking fields of fire from snipers and machine guns, with every conceivable piece of ground inside the impact area of Japanese mortars and artillery who were positioned so well that counterbattery and naval gunfire barely touched them. All the while the CG was telling his commanders to not try to bypass/flank the mountain range but to assault through them west to east, which is exactly how the Japanese defenses were situated.",d5264be44e68f9da6b6cac615238e5de806fa18b,True,False,,,,,0,1650039696,,0,{},i4ujl4j,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4u01pn,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4ujl4j/,1650039707,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650010896.0,,,,

To show how warped their minds were, in the late evening/early morning after the second atomic bomb was dropped, the six most powerful men in Japan, whose unanimous decision was needed before anything could then be brought before the Emperor to be approved, they were still arguing over the terms.

The only way in which Russia is strengthening with time is that now that their commanders know that they are actually at war, Russia has more time to get their logistics in order and weed out corruption.

At the same time, Ukraine is calling up it's massive troop reserves and fully mobilizing the population.  Right now, it is still mostly Ukraine's pre-war army that is fighting because it takes a solid 60 days before you train a recruit.  Ukraine didn't mobilize until Russia attacked, so their mobilizing forces are just now starting to trickle into combat.

It’s common sure, but assuming the Russian hulls are all RHA isn’t an assumption I would want to make. Assuming that the Soviet RHA hulls were all made to spec, I’d also not what I would consider a safe bet. You should read up on it. 

&gt;	At the side and the rear? Sure. I guess you could knock out the engine or 

The armor almost everywhere on every tank, the Leopard, the Abrams, the T90 etc, is not at all heavily armored. The hulls are known to be susceptible to penetration and even HE is going to get through, and it’s not going to take 10,000 rounds either. I wouldn’t want to be in the crew compartment while an IFV puts 25 or 30mm on the side hull next to where my legs are. 

&gt;	What’s a moderate amount of HE? And what is the precision of a 30 mm autocannon? 

Say, 300 rounds. The precision is incredibly precise and especially so at short range. At long range with known distance, I’ve seen great hits during stress shoots. The range in OP feels close to zeroing range. 

&gt;	Is it actually realistic to hit the same spot over and over again? 

In short, yes. Especially when the standard is ‘close enough together to cause armor degradation.’ OP looks to be less than point blank range. 

&gt;	High explosive rounds explode on the surface of a target, and with armour as thick as an mbt, 

The HE will chip away at the armor. It will work on cracking the steel. The armor on an MBT hull is not terribly thick, not on a single hull on earth. WWII levels of armor (or worse) is common for a hull and easily defeated by all sorts of modern systems. The hull has always been the weak spot and your officers just failed to mention that the reason you were training to fire from a tiered fighting position, is because you’ve got to hide your hull behind all that dirt.",d5f06b73670d5184c1744ffa2eb43f65a3da6656,True,False,,,,,0,1650037042,,0,{},i4ud2nz,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4u85ib,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4ud2nz/,1650037056,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650008242.0,,,,

South Vietnam literally caused the war themselves, Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to take part in 1956 reunification elections agreed upon at the 1954 Geneva Conference was the entire reason why the communist insurgency that coalesced into the VC began. 

*""In such a dire situation, the US support of the fledgling democracy in the South needed to be as ruthless as their pitiless Communist adversaries.""* 

South Vietnam's first president came to power via rigged elections (Diem won more votes than there were actual voters). In fact, the opposition was the last emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, who Diem supported previously. Bao Dai (emperor) was not allowed to campaign, so Diem was guaranteed to become president.

South Vietnam's first president immediately became authoritative. He persecuted Buddhists and political dissidents and Rummel (1997) estimates that 16,000 - 167,000 civilians were killed be Diems regime alone. The US government gave the greenlight for his removal / assassination in 1963 (Cable 243) after the 1963 Buddhist Pagoda raids.

1. Diem's regime survives first coup in 1960
2. Diem was assassinated in a coup by Duong Van Minh and replaced by a military Junta in 1963.
3. Doung Van Minh's Junta was ousted in a coup led by Nguyen Khanh in Jan 1964. Minh's Junta was replaced by Khanh's Junta.
4. Nguyen Khanh sets up the High National Council (civilian advisory body) under heavy US pressure to give a semblance of civilian rule in South Vietnam. Khanh appointed Duong Van Minh, the man he literally just ousted as one of the leading members along with Tran Thien Khiem. Khanh allows Minh to pick the members and Minh picks 17 civilian members who side with Minh.
5. Tran Thien Khiem (The other leading member of the HNC that Khanh selected), then launches a coup on Khanh, which fails.\\
6. Khanh then dissolves the HNC 3 months after setting it up, pissing off the Americans.
7. Another coup is launched on Khanh in Feb 1965 to put the same Tran Thien Khiem from above, into power. It fails! And then funnily enough, a third party, led by Nguyen Cao Ky, who disliked both sides of the coup, just went ahead and ousted Khanh themselves and took power. And yes you guessed it, formed another military junta.
8. The US is getting sick and tired of their shit at this point and forces South Vietnam to hold presidential elections in 1967 (Diem was the last president).
9. Nguyen Cao Ky (the third party who luckily took power in the chaos of the last coup), plans to run, but is convinced by Nguyen Van Thieu to drop out and run as Thieu's running mate and later Vice President. He agrees, Van Thieu wins and then Cao Ky is immediately sidelined and given no power (lol).
10. Van Thieu, in classic south vietnamese style, goes full corruption mode. He actually gains such a reputation that in 1971 when he went for re-election, he automatically won because no one wanted to run against him as they believed he would falsify any results in his favour. 
11. Van Thieu resigns 9 days before South Vietnam's fall. In his famous words ""I resign, but I do not desert"".
12. Van Thieu flees Vietnam 5 days later to Taiwan
13. To complete the circle, Duong Van Minh, who led the first coup against Diem, becomes President of South Vietnam.... for 2 days, and then hands the country over to North Vietnam

10/10 democracy South Vietnam.

*""In addition, the former colonial overlord and regional hegemon had 300K troops based in North Vietnam.""*

Okay? And just prior to this, the previous colonial overlord had just waged war in Vietnam for 9 years to reconquer Vietnam with indirect and direct US assistance and involvement (US was directly involved at Dien Bien Phu, and two pilots were KIA). Oh and just prior to this, the US was in favour of Vietnamese independence and directly objected to any French attempts at going back to Vietnam. In fact the US was constantly butting heads with the British and French over Indochina, as the US viewed British operations in Indochina as a means to pave the wave for a later French return.

*"" that Indo-China should not go back to France but that it should be administered by an international trusteeship. France has had the country—thirty million inhabitants for nearly one hundred years, and the people are worse off than they were at the beginning... but the case of Indo-China is perfectly clear. France has milked it for one hundred years. The people of Indo-China are entitled to something better than that.* **- Roosevelt's memo to Cordell Hull Jan 24th 1944.**  


*""In favor of anything that is against the Japanese in Indochina provided that we do not align ourselves with the French""* \- **President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Indochina at the Yalta Conference 1945.**

*""Roosevelt said that he wanted to discontinue colonization in the SEA area and that he was determined that there would be no military assistance to the French in Indochina""* \- **Lt.Gen Wedemeyer on instructions from Roosevelt regarding the Japanese coup in Vietnam.**

""*He saw no evidence that the Viet Minh were communistic and though that their sole purpose was independence""* \- **Maj. Allison K. Thomas, part of OSS Deer team who dropped into North Vietnam to assist the Viet Minh, on his opinion regarding the Viet Minh. Thomas would later go on to march with the Viet Minh into Hanoi (can be seen in photos during the march).**

*""Lord Mountbatten is using the American lend-lease supplies and other American resources to invade Indo-China to defeat what we believe to be the American policy and to re-establish French imperialism""  -* **Ambassador Patrick J. Hurley on British support to French in Indochina**

Less than two weeks prior to the commencement of Operation Masterdom (British/Japanese/French joint operation to remove Viet Minh from Saigon), Lt. Col. Archimedes Patti was in Vietnam to oversee the transfer of allied POW's. In his 1981 interview, he recounts the pleasant conversations he had with Vo Nguyen Giap and Ho Chi Minh and how Giap surprised him outside the villa Patti was staying in with a 50 piece band playing star spangled banner with the flags of the US/UK/Soviets/China and Vietnam flying overhead (Patti can be see in photos saluting the flag next to Vo Nguyen Giap). Patti also assisted Ho Chi Minh in editing the draft declaration of Independence for Vietnam and was present in the crowd during the declaration on 2nd September 1945.

&amp;#x200B;

After the French retook control in the south in a coup on 24/25th of September 1945, Ho Chi Minh sent two desperate letters directly to Truman (archived and available online) begging for US help and intervention to remove the French and prevent war from breaking out). The US remains silent until 1949 when they being supporting the French. This also might sound familiar because Ho Chi Minh did the exact same thing in 1919 when he sent a letter to US secretary of state Robert Lansing asking for US help in giving Vietnam independence but he was ignored (but the letter was archived and is now available online).

Russia said its warship ""remains afloat"" after a fire detonated ammunition on board, while Ukrainian officials said the Moskva was hit by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles and has sunk.

“We’re not quite exactly sure what happened here. We do assess that there was an explosion — at least one explosion on this cruiser — a fairly major one at that, that has caused extensive damage to the ship,” Kirby said.  
Kirby said the damaged Russian warship is afloat and ""making her own way across the Black Sea.""

&gt;“We assess that the ship is able to make its own way, and it is doing that; it's heading more towards now we think the east. We think it's probably going to be putting in at Sevastopol for repairs, but we don’t know what exactly caused that,” Kirby added.

You can breach concrete with just about anything, and you will indeed chip it apart as you go along. I've taken down concrete with aforementioned pickaxe before. It is certainly not realistic to do that to any kind of vehicle armour. 

I'd assume most Russian tank armour is RHA and composite materials for the most part, unless they're using some really old gear type the first model t72. 

I think you know just as well as me that tanks have weak spots. Very few at the front though. Perhaps a lucky 30mm ap can go through the turret ring, but perhaps not. I don't actually know the thickness of the armour at that point. I'm quite confident that HE cannot penetrate anywhere.

At the side and the rear? Sure. I guess you could knock out the engine or penetrate the drive sprockets with armour piercing rounds.

What's a moderate amount of HE? And what is the precision of a 30 mm autocannon? Is it actually realistic to hit the same spot over and over again? High explosive rounds explode on the surface of a target, and with armour as thick as an mbt, most of the energy will dissipate outwards and be reflected, leaving relatively little energy to actually effect the armour itself.

Would it be practical to use light attack turboprop aircraft (something similar to the super tucano) in the same role that Russia is using the Mi-24 and 35?

Benefits? Roughly the same price, assuming easier to train pilots on, range, and I'm wagering higher speed at lower or similar altitudes the attack helicopters fly would make them harder to hit with MANPADS but obviously not impossible.

A step above the Tucano would perhaps be the Yak-130 they've supposedly developed, but I have no idea how well weapons are integrated into that system or what the operating costs would be for all 3.

Obviously lol.

&gt;You don't need a cook-off to have a tank killed. If you damage as little as its tracks and the crew abandons it, it  becomes a mission kill.

I said that in the first sentence? Those tanks are likely disabled. 

My assumption and assertion is that his claim the btr ""killed"" the tanks, in this context the kill seems to point to them both being destroyed not just removed from action in the clip, seems unlikely given the context of the video. 

The closest tank to the btr especially. The smoke you see is the engine throttling up and the tank drives forward and starts to turn right after taken several 30mm shots to the rear. Then the video ends.

Why end it there? When one tank is obviously operational(driving away), and the status of the other in the 20 seconds in unknown. Likely heavily damaged, especially on its sensors, potentially tracks, and given the right ammo its engine, ect.

Calling these tanks killed is definitely a stretch, and most telling is the video cutting right when the combat is set to peak, either killing the dismounting tankers, or just ending with them obviously disabled. 

I know we are debating over small definitions differences. But I dont think killed is appropriate here without followup video or pictures given how the clip ends with one vehicle clearly moving.

For example, someone fires a LMG into a pickup trucks rear, then it starts driving away and you turn the clip off. Would you mark that up as a kill?",4ee7a06dcdcf72cff6619f68ec92087bba370c5d,True,False,,,,,0,1650033683,,0,{},i4u51w4,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4tf8n2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4u51w4/,1650033700,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650004883.0,,,,

Great. Cite. 

‘Last I remember’ and ‘I believe’ aren’t sufficient to back up your claims of ‘we have proof.’  Anyway, I’m thinking the data you remember doesn’t make the point you think it makes. I know Javs go through T90’s like a hot knife. 

You were trying to say the T90 has a great APS system, even though that system doesn’t even pretend to work against a Jav. 

You were trying to say that the ERA stops a Jav. 1) You’ve yet to show that is the case. 2) You’ve yet to show that even if the ERA protects the crew from a Jav, that the ERA doesn’t help destroy the tank anyway. Or, are you contending that equal and opposite force doesn’t apply? Or, are you contending the force is mitigated in some way? What tamps the ERA on a tank? The armor itself or something else. 

&gt;	One disadvantage of the javelin is how slow it flies, making it easier for systems to identify it. 

What system? How? Be specific. Provide a secondary citation or some raw data. No data set I’ve ever seen backs this up.  No one I’ve seen even claims this, except in some crazy article out of USMA where the author specifically mentioned he had to have help from one of the NCOs with actual experience. 

&gt;	I dont think it is really fair to be calling a lot of these systems Vietnam era tech considering the different generations of each system

And here you show your lack of understanding on the topic. Wire guided, line of sight, horizontal flight ATGMs are Vietnam era tech that are defeated at almost perfect rates by the Trophy APS, and is the exact type of weapon the Russians claim their APS defeats.

Thanks. My point exactly. A point that people can’t seem to understand. But I’m not claiming to know everything, just a few things I’ve learned in combat and in many years as a combat infantryman. 

Have you ever breached with any of the different ammo choices?  If so, what did you find worked in different situations? 25mm training ammo actually does a great job on reinforced concrete. It cracks it into chunks quite well. 

&gt;	Tanks have thick armour as they are among other things expected to engage other tanks.

Everywhere? Or, basically just on the front of the turret, and on the side turret on some tanks?  For the hull, are these Russian tanks all outfitted with RHA or are many cast steel?

&gt;	APCs are expected to engage lighter armoured targets and infantry.

Well, not all APCs, but the IFV part of the family sure is, you are correct. The point is that if an IFV, especially one with a 30mm bangs away at it, they will penetrate most of the armor on a tank in a reasonable amount of time, 

&gt;	Good luck hitting tank armour with 30mm HE enough times to breach it before you are lit up like a birthday candle.

Here is the straw man argument. I never said it was a good idea or tactically ideal, did I? But yup, if you pound with just a moderate amount of HE, you’re going to get through armor most places on a T90, just not everyplace. If you pound with both load outs filled with even training ammo, I bet a penetration will happen. Hit anything, as you already agreed, long enough and you’ll get through.

If China plays its cards right, they'll economically gain the upper hand over Russia - no need for bullying, but they certainly will gain a better negotiating position economically.

If anything, I think this is an eye-opener for China to just give up on Taiwan.

Companies will take a hit, but it's not like basic necessities are hit. It's a free preview of what might happen if China does invade stuff.

The status quo still to me seems like a decent win for China - mostly on the intel (they know what Russia is (not) capable of and how the world will react) and economical balance side.

In any case, it's just how I see things and I'm just a software developer, not a military/economical/geopolitical analyst.",05ef52c5a1cfc0763f5b0e2f7179990b54e4f4ec,True,False,,,,,0,1650030181,,0,{},i4tx6ln,False,t3_u32mt5,False,True,t1_i4trs6g,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32mt5/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41422/i4tx6ln/,1650030194,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650001381.0,,,,

This is just a small update by me not many vehicles have been added but since oryx listet two high value targets i decided to do a quick update anyway.
Another SU34 and a KA-52 where shot down. Other than that i noticed an increase in downed drones lately.

Some smaller stuff like ATGM's and MANPADS still missing and i don't think i'll add them anytime soon just a waste of costly pixels.

Disclaimer: I am no expert on russian military vehicles so those graphics for the vehicles may sometimes be wrong i tried my best to match them as good as possible and change them from time to time.

Only most competent militaries could probably avoid any kind of war crime and eruptions of violence, especially when you are not too successful. I am talking about something like Bucha. Yes, that is in any way or for a crime and just wrong.

While deaths during air strikes or artillery is a bit another thing. They are mostly accidental as it seems Ukrainian soldiers really do not try to avoid urban combat and very often take positions in populated areas as they provide more cover even if you create extra risk to surrounding population.

&gt;If you started with ""the holocaust is good"" you are just fucked.

But this is no holocaust. It is a tragedy, it is a crime, it is slaughter, but it really doesn't feel like genocide. For that it shouldn't be random it should be coordinated effort.


&gt;The real situation is ""the guys comitting the holocaust are good"" and if you want to listen to why they're actually good you're wasting your time because there is no justification.

Have seen cases of tortured PoWs on Ukrainian side. There are accusations that some civilians suffered from Ukrainian forces too, especially in Donbass. If people really cared about fairness, war crimes then these things wouldn't be skipped. That is the thing, rules do not apply to a single side, however, the same people who demand justice on one side not that rarely ask for executions and death on another.

Like in this case, who knows what that soldier in an armoured vehicle has done. We don't know anything. Most likely he didn't participate in war crimes, especially when it is not some commander.

Hello, this is my dead son, Belchenko Daniil, who was ruthlessly killed by Ilchenko VV with the assistance of RadomyshlskaVarta  
My name is Karina Belchenko, I would like to cover the story of the murder of my child, Daniel Belchenko (12 years old), who was killed in the yard of his own house by representatives of the local group for protection of the population of Radomyshl, Zhytomyr region.  
On March 7, 2022, my son and a neighbor's boy (10 years old) played in the yard of their own house, where we fled from Kyiv after the war in Ukraine. At 4:10 p.m., people in camouflage weapons broke into the yard and started firing on the children without warning. The children were very frightened and ran across the yard to a nearby garden to hide. I was at home with my family at the time. When we heard the shots, we tried to run outside to see what had happened. In front of the door, stood a man with a machine gun and did not let us out of the house to see what happened, citing the fact that they found the saboteurs and shot at them! But they were children !! We started shouting that the children should not shoot, but it was too late! When we were released from the house, Yurko and Ilchenko, who were shooting at children, had already fled the scene. They were detained on the way out of the garden, and substances were found in the car, which later, according to the examination, turned out to be a narcotic substance!  
Now the suspects are in jail, but have already changed their testimony and are appealing for a change of location. I don't know what to do, the murderers want to be acquitted and released!  
My son will not be returned, but if they are released they will continue to be able to kill innocent children! Defendant Ilchenko, who is guilty of my son’s death, has money and connections, so he is behaving very defiantly!",31caed80978a4a5612d5bbdd0d91e81c2b51d1b7,True,False,,,,,0,1650028918,,0,{},i4tulfc,False,t3_u32mt5,False,True,t1_i4ttkuh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32mt5/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41422/i4tulfc/,1650028935,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650000118.0,,,,

&gt;Russians commonly use the word khokhol as an ethnic slur for Ukrainians, as it was a common haircut of Ukrainian Cossacks. The term is frequently derogatory or condescending, an equivalent of the Ukrainian term katsap and Polish kacap for Russians. The word comes from Proto-Slavic xoxolъ &lt; \*koxolъ, “crest, tuft.”  
Besides calling Ukrainians khokhly, Russians also refer to Ukraine as Khokhlyandiya (Ukrainian: Хохляндія, Хохландія) and Khokhlostan (Ukrainian: Хохлостан). The word ""Khokhol"" with the meaning of ""unconscious Ukrainian"" refers to the person who renounced their independence, individuality and allegiance to Russia, and instead began using Turkisms (words derived from Turkic languages) that were incorporated into the Ukrainian language.

The Viet Cong were directly supported by the North who were supplied by the USSR. The North also had hundreds of thousands of PRC personnel deployed in the DRV. Lets not pretend otherwise. It was one superpower and one regional hegemon backing the North who in turn supplied the VC, they were not just simple farmers fighting with sharpened fruit.

And they were largely irrelevant after Tet and the flight of the South Vietnamese population to the cities. There is a reason the North went back to conventional offensives, the VC strategy was not going to work especially after the South's far more successful attempt at land reform.

HCM's brutal land reform was fully Maoist in form and practice. Whatever they were during the war, they had embraced the ideology like good little lackeys by the 50s.

&gt;Because Korea war is Civil war, Vietnam war is a continious from librated war.

Vietnam only took the shape it did at the start of the 19th century, it is younger than even the USA and was originally built off the conquests in the south of the modern country. It is not ethnically homogenous either with the indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands suffering extreme ethnic cleansing both pre and post 1975. Your portrayal of the war as simply being about liberation is hopelessly simplistic.

My sweet summer child, it is no longer a Communist country and it embraced market oriented reforms in 1986 a mere 11 years after the 'victory' which saw 30 years of struggle for an ideology that was dumped in just over a decade because it doesn't work.

It's so interesting if you go on JSOCarchive you learn so much about the politics of special forces. SEALs it's like an old boys club they cover up and back their own, but like CAG( Delta) you  have to meet the standard or you will turn up and your keycard isn't working.  


It's crazy that one of the DEVGRU operators was literally a crack addict and failed part of the selection but he was pushed through as someone who was a politician with conenctions was backing him. He even relapsed and was still kept and supported, but he served with honour then was KIA, a very skilled operator.  


It really says something though. People can look at the lower amount of black people in the most elite units, or even decades ago when racism was far more fierce... It tells you that even a white dude that doesn't have connections is disadvantaged.  


So what black person  who is a former crackhead would be selected for SEAL teams then DEVGRU having failed part of selection but been pushed through anyway? It would never happen.  


Interesting how much of the most elite special forces units it's like a school girl circle/ old boys club theres a lot of politics and popularity contests and people  basically get through on favours at times

&amp;#x200B;

People have even said that DJ Shipley who was like the youngest ever NAVY SEAL was basically guaranteed a spot in the SEAL teams because his father  (Don Shipley) retired and it was like a ""swap"" with kind of an understanding he took his place.

I would question a few of the supposed tank kills I've seen with 30mm autocannon. A lot of soviet era tanks carry external fuel tanks that would light up in a big fireball without necessarily causing much damage to the tank.

Good luck hitting tank armour with 30mm HE enough times to breach it before you are lit up like a birthday candle.

Japan was definitely trying to surrender already, but they wanted a negotiated surrender with conditions, so they could have a somewhat favorable outcome. The Allies unanimously insisted on unconditional surrender, which Japan refused. 

The Soviet invasion was a huge shock, but not for any military reason. Manchuria had already been given up as lost by Japan, since their army in the region was cut off by US naval blockade and starving to death, so its loss wasn't a surprise. The USSR also didn't have any amphibious assault capabilities in the Pacific, so an invasion of Japan wasn't seriously a threat. (When the Soviets did occupy some northern islands, they had to borrow US landing ships in order to do so). 

What *was* a surprise was that the Soviet declaration of war effectively ended Japan's chance for a conditional surrender. Prior to that, the Soviets had been backchanneling with Japan (ie unofficial negotiations), promising them that a conditional surrender could be achieved. This hope for conditional surrender was what kept Japan's ""peace faction"" in power, while its hardliners advocated for fighting to the death and inflicting massive losses on the invaders. 

When the Soviets attacked, these backchannel negotiations were revealed as a ruse, and it became immediately clear to the Japanese government that their only way to achieve peace was unconditional surrender. The news of this was delivered at the same time as the Nagasaki bombing, serving as a double whammy - initially, the Japanese thought the US could only possibly build 1 bomb, so weathering its impact was possible. 

Faced with the threat of repeated nuclear attacks - which they could not effectively fight - and the lost hope of a negotiated surrender, the Emperor publicly threw his weight behind an unconditional surrender. Even then, the hardliners advocated fighting to the death, and attempted a coup to continue the war. So the surrender was a close run thing.",b7d610b1444c78e519b58380701d43879af8dc73,True,False,,,,,0,1650011132,,0,{},i4t4x0w,False,t3_u3t89x,False,True,t1_i4rudsh,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3t89x/grant_f_wolfkill_former_combat_cinematographer/i4t4x0w/,1650011147,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649982332.0,,,,

This is so cringe. This is dumb and not true (even for some of history's most out of touch commanders) and the type of thing I can't believe people actually think. Its illogical.

The Vietnam memorial is literally names. Every highway in america it seems is named after a dead veteran. What kind of country and governmental/societal system even produces the callousness and fanaticism that you are suggesting? Should be employ ourselves like Stalin or the imperial Japanese kamikazees?

Shit dude the guy above is literally quoting that ""upon the altar of freedom"" quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln in a letter to a Lydia Bixby for the loss of her sons, which a quick google soruce can find the name for.

This isnt a history channel cliche or a stalin quote on a college poster, this is real life. Yes hard choices are made and yes people sacrifice themselves and I can only imagine what causes them to make such choices. But they have fucking names. They know it when they die. And people remember them long after they're gone.  i have zero idea what that is really like.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The longer they fight, the higher the Russian losses will be while the Ukranian losses in Mariupol stay the same. Plus it is going to be even harder for Russia to properly celebrate May 9th because they have to delay their grand offensive if they cannot free up troops from Mariupol.

I'm asking honestly here, is the suggestion that ruining the may 9th celebration would be a motivation for these people to sacrifice their lives?

Yup. Doesn’t appear to be very effective. 

&gt;	They also have the turret maneuver on detection to help bolster its defenses. 

It’s called ‘slewing’ and it doesn’t apply to a Jav. 

&gt;	A moving t-90 with smoke flairs going 

Those ancient things can’t detect when a Jav is targeting them and won’t know when to pop the flares, but as you say, it may barely work even when deployed. 50/50 isn’t a good survival rate. 

&gt;	The US armed multiple groups in Syria with javelins..?

‘Sent them’ isn’t ‘multiple examples’ of them working or not working against ERA. Still no citation. 

&gt;	In terms of global hardware, thats pretty modern to me..

‘Modern’ does not include tech from the Vietnam War.  The Aero is an interesting upgrade, as is the 2B warhead, but the wire guided system is old. For the TOW, it also requires horizontal flight which renders them very weak against a functioning APS, which is the whole reason for the Aero.  If they aren’t fire and forget high AoA ATGMs, or BLOS, they aren’t modern. 

&gt;	I disagree. High angle of attack is the weapon of today, whereas there hasn’t been much innovation very recently in terms of defending against said advances. The next big leap will stem from the reaction to top down missiles imo.

That’s a big thing to say when not a single APS has been shown to work against them in any data set I’ve ever seen; for ~25 years. Anyway, the Drone Age will over take such systems eventually, yes. There is still not a single thing set to counter EFP submunitions like the SMArt. So while the warhead may deployed on a drone or a submunition and not a missile, the point stands that the tank is dead on the modern battlefield, except for very limited and specific use cases.",715bc0bd664aed0d93eb114a07292ca17353c5c1,True,False,,,,,0,1650009399,,0,{},i4t2uy9,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4t1mlu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4t2uy9/,1650009410,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649980599.0,,,,

Russia has been putting ERA's on their turrets to reduce the effectiveness of top down strikes. It isn't super effective (I think the current estimates is a 60-70% hit ratio in single shot scenario from a distance). They also have the turret maneuver on detection to help bolster its defenses. A moving t-90 with smoke flairs going has from what I've read, roughly a 50-50 chance of avoiding a direct, critical hit. Thats not a silver bullet, but it is a damn effective weapon against Russia either way, i'll give you that.

&gt;What ‘multiple examples’ do we have for modern a ATGM being used in Syria? A Javelin? A Type 01 LMAT? A TOW 2B Aero?

The US armed multiple groups in Syria with javelins..?

&gt;Wired missiles? The Aero is making an attempt at modernity but wired systems are not modern.

In terms of global hardware, thats pretty modern to me.. I can agree to disagree on what we consider modern as its rather subjective.

&gt;High Angle of Attack missiles with top attack modes are the future.

I disagree. High angle of attack is the weapon of today, whereas there hasn't been much innovation very recently in terms of defending against said advances. The next big leap will stem from the reaction to top down missiles imo.",d67c0303ff9949f583f09b241f1108a2fba8bf92,True,False,,,,,0,1650008365,,0,{},i4t1mlu,False,t3_u3pydl,False,True,t1_i4syqd8,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3pydl/a_russian_tank_being_destroyed_by_heavy_fire_in/i4t1mlu/,1650008379,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649979565.0,,,,

It's only logical to assume that tech which was designed to be a potential equal actually is - and dangerous to assume it isn't. 
If Russia sends in their best and latest equipment, and it gets defeated by a nation with a fraction of their military size/budget, then that would very quickly diminish their global perceived power and would serve both as a morale boost to the enemy along with the opposite for their own forces.
Losses like those would serve to embolden their enemies  both current and potentially future ones.

They did as they were told, changed into civilian clothing in case they were caught, and then walked along a road waiting for the bus to arrive.. instead ISIS showed up on many vehicles and got off with guns in hand telling them they would not be harmed and take them home.

Instead they told them to split up into non-religious+Shia from Sunni and if they said they were Sunni but weren't they would regret it.

What they did not tell them was that they would kill everyone that wasn't Sunni (everyone in the video) regardless, so they lied to them at least twice.

Reports say about 1,000-1,100 were killed but it could have been at least 1,800.  No one is 100% positive, but there are also reports from the lone survivor that they were sold out by the Iraqi Officers who told ISIS about the cadets in exchange for them to get away with their lives.  Of course the Officers who lived denied this since all the Cadets who could have spoken the truth (minus the one survivor who was interviewed by the NY Times and is still alive with his family today iirc) are now all dead.

Truly horrific and I am pretty sure most of the ISIS soldiers in this video have been killed over the years.  There may be a few left but their day will come.  They have perverted Islam to say it's okay to kill anyone else that isn't them when the Quran does not teach that at all.  They essentially took one line in the Quran talking about a specific moment in time (and it doesn't even tell them to kill anyone) and turned it into an excuse to become serial killers and mass murderers.  

They use these backwoods teachings to recruit uneducated or angry people from other countries, where they do stupid things like behead two Scandinavian girls who were just going on a trip around the world.  Or recruit that Canadian guy into ISIS and then send him on the front lines to get blown up for their stupid ISIS propaganda videos when the kid had no combat experience whatsoever.

Or you get guys like Jihadi John who grew up in London and was bullied for having bad breath all his life when his horrible mother didn't teach him how to brush his teeth or his tongue, which fueled his hate for mankind and made him happy to behead people who had never done a thing to him.

You have precisely summed up the situation. Precision weapons are a lot harder to use to win a war than mass weapons to target civilians.

The US has now the resources to employ them. Insurgent groups do not. Heck, ISIS didn't even have one-tenth of US GDP in 1945, let alone today.

This is one thing that absolutely fascinates me about authoritarian/totalitarian propaganda.

They talk about how they're there to de-nazify and liberate, but also how they should brutalize Ukrainians. How it's just a fire that sunk the Moskva, but it's an attack by NATO on their soil.

Mind you, Turks living in Anatolia were less than 10 million during those periods...

Moreover there had been no bloodshed in the island after we re-conquered the northern part, if we didn't intervene in 74, there'd been violence for years to come, and probably tens of thousands Turks and greeks would have died, and would have suffered terrific deaths because of nature of civil wars, such examples are: Yugoslavia, Syria etc.

Whereas during Op. Atilla total KIAs and MIAs: 1600 for Turks and 1500 - 1600 for greeks, with 1/3 of each side being military, so this issue had been resolved with 2000 KIA and MIA civilians in total from both sides.

Even if I were an objective humanitarian instead of a nationalistic Turk, I'd still consider it a win since it prevented further bloodshed.",621e9afa8a1d5413cda569458f51839a016594e4,True,False,,,,,0,1649997056,,0,{},i4sm7up,False,t3_u32am9,False,True,t1_i4sigbx,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32am9/first_moments_of_operation_attila_turkish_army_in/i4sm7up/,1649997073,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649968256.0,,,,

That's not the same thing. The bulk of the Japanese army had not been engaged in combat and they had approximately 2.5million men on the Home Islands with at least that many spread around their various holdings. They had the capacity and the will to resist for far longer and were indeed planning to do so, even after the first bombing.

The war was not won yet, but even if it was, they most certainly didn't know it. In fact, the Allies believed the opposite as they had intercepted numerous communications to that effect. You have the benefit of 80 years hindsight to assume the war was about to end anyways yet all the facts point to many months more of war, at the very least. Hell, the war was unwinnable for Japan by the end of 1942 yet there 3 more years of war anyways, just to illustrate the point.

The Soviets were not going to invade the Home Islands. They got involved as a land grab but the war was not going to be ended by the invasion of Manchuria alone and its silly to think the Soviets were going to be the ones landing troops on the islands.

But assume that the invasion was never really going to happen, like you keep claiming (falsely, based on the build up that was already occurring). So then the Japanese are starved into submission and millions die of famine and disease while the US blockades the seas and Russia picks up tasty morsels of land. You really think that's a better alternative to the atomic bombings? The bombings hardly killed anyone relative to conventional bombings and many of the deaths were due to lack of medical care to survivors vs the detonation itself. 

I don't really see your point. So maybe the atomic bomb wasn't necessary. Maybe they could have just waited for many more civilians to die off on their own or maybe they could have invaded, is that really a ""better"" alternative? Let's even assume the Soviet invasion played a larger role than the bombing (it didn't). Even then, it alone wouldn't have been enough and nor would the bombings. So what is your end conclusion here?

It was not a moral act, it was an immoral war crime, whether or not you believe it was necessary is a different discussion. But to claim the pacific bombing campaign was justified because the entire nation was an enemy combatant is a great example of why you might want to examine your own biases before calling any criticism of US policy to be ""anti-us rhetoric."" That is an absolutely appalling statement to make, but I suppose not surprising. 

The USSR had plans to invade Hokaido after invading the Sakhalins. Japan could not determine USSR's amphibious capabilities, and had almost no defenses in the northeast of the country that would require significant amphibious resources, because they were grouped in the south. Kawabe Toroshiro himself said ""The absolute maintenance of peace in our relations with the Soviet Union is one of the fundamental conditions for continuing the war.""

You see in the video they are attacking groups of multiple enemies, you can see its multiple humvees and in one of them its even an APC in the convoy as well. A soldier with an RPG can only rocket 1 vehicle before a reload. This gives time for the enemy infantry to respond, and the Iraqi army wears body armour which means it'll take multiple shots to break through it, and even after you pierce it 7.62x39mm FMJ ammo that uses a steel core, like M43 russian FMJ, will have a small wound channel instead of the bigger wound channel the Yugoslavian M67 FMJ ammo gives because it tumbles when it hits flesh while M43 tends to icepick. And people in this region can't decide to choose what ammo they use, they use whatever is available which means a hodgepodge of every brand possible.

Now think how many enemies could be at these parked convoys? A humvee has about 5 people, we see about 3 humvees in each video, so thats 15 enemies around.

You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.

Interestingly, there is a bit of spread between impacts and that's actually by design. It's called an Area Weapons System (AWS), and a bit of bullet spread is a feature as the rounds are explosive, so the spread is meant to saturate an area with shrapnel.",11ad61610c487800cdc3721571d56fe95798f2f0,True,False,,,,,0,1649991570,,0,{},i4sc95g,False,t3_u32s4d,False,True,t1_i4mykle,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u32s4d/2_ah64d_apache_gunships_engage_a_taliban_platoon/i4sc95g/,1649991587,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649962770.0,,,,

Israel is not killing civilians in this flare up, the Palestinian ISIS and Islamic Jihad has staged a series or terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. I just don't understand how anyone can support or make excuses for ISIS knifing pregnant women or an Islamic Jihad militant opening fire into a bar.

The Israeli incursions into Jenin went to get those that planned organized the attacks and the infrastructure that armed them.

Those killed were either armed with fire arms, or were throwing firebombs at Israeli forces, making them combatants, even at 14. Instead of blaming Israel, a person with a moral compass would blame the Palestinians for using child soldiers, an actual war crime.

&gt; calling for an extermination of the “dogs” and “animals” that occupy their Zion

This is literally not true, It's your [Palestinian buddies that call for the extermination of Jews worldwide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azEgBsU6Mi8&amp;t=10s), meanwhile Israel has an actual Islamist part in it's government.

&gt;Israel has slowly taken over Palestinian land

Again, you're deeply deeply ignorant, I seriously advise you to look at information aside from extremist Palestinian propaganda. The Jews have always lived in Palestine, before the Arabs. The Arabs ethnically cleansed the Jews from Judea and Samarea, and Gaza in the 1948 war. When Israel recaptured the land in 1967, the Jews went back to living in places they have inhabited for thousands of years, such as Hebron, a city founded by Jews, Eastern Jerusalem, another city founded by Jews, and Gush Ezion.

Do you honestly believe that Jews are not allowed to live in Judea? Are Arabs that live and build homes in Israel taking ""Jewish land""? See how your arguments make no sense and are actually extremely racist?",73ac9b49081cb2247b63d9da79294444562b2c40,True,False,,,,,0,1649991426,,0,{},i4sbz09,False,t3_u2xgtv,False,True,t1_i4s6tvy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u2xgtv/video_shows_pij_militants_in_firefight_with_idf/i4sbz09/,1649991437,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649962626.0,,,,

I know that RU is in full propaganda mode - which includes ordering their troops to manufacture scenes and video them for propaganda purposes, and includes publishing fake video after stealing BBC logos to make it look like a BBC report and not something from TASS.  Maybe you saw the fake video about the supposed POWs shot in the legs by ""UKR"" forces?  Fake.  How about the US General captured and executed by RU in Donbas?  Or the reports that Moskva was lost 'in a storm' after 'catching fire' with no mention of the two anti-ship missiles UKR hit it with?  

I'm looking at the videos and trying to figure out what was plausible - I'm not jumping to conclusions.  As new information arrived, that analytical opinion changed.  Now that there's confirmation from the Ukrainians, it's clear this was indeed a UKR team capturing a RU BMP that was approached and killed by a RU tank that was part of the crowd running for Belarus.

3397.0,[],False,,Time-Elephant92,,,[],,,,text,t2_8b8vqmww,False,False,"Looks like I have to eat my words a bit. I did some research, and since I got out of the Army (2014) they actually have transitioned most infantry units to the M4A1 which does have automatic capability (fire selector goes: safe, semi, auto). From what I could read, the main rationale for the conversion was to obtain a heavier and more durable barrel, and because the automatic fire trigger mechanism leads to a softer and more consistent trigger pull which should lead to more accurate semi auto fire. 

Fighting in Afghanistan showed the Army that soldiers needed more durable barrels, as regular M4 barrels were melting and warping during extended fights. The M4A1 came with the better barrel (because it is built to stand up to auto fire) and a better trigger to boot. Those were the reasons for the change, not because big Army wants its soldiers flipping to auto. 

Why? And why does SF use full auto more often? A big reason is because of the makeup of an infantry squad. The argument for full auto rifles largely revolves around the occasional need for suppressing fire. A regular infantry squad has far better tools for that than a battle rifle. A squad will have 9 soldiers. Two will be carrying SAW’s and 2 will be equipped with grenade launchers. In addition there is also a platoon heavy machine gun squad that can provide support when needed. That’s a lot of firepower to bring to bear when needed. That’s also a lot more firepower than a typical SF team will be carrying. No need to have riflemen conduct suppressing fire, better to have them take controlled and well aimed shots.",930ebc4f2544c8e05bf4f7068f76ec4ee2ee387f,True,False,,,,,0,1649986432,,0,{},i4s1kqg,False,t3_u3do4s,False,True,t1_i4r6l6f,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u3do4s/urban_combat_in_mariupol_april_13th/i4s1kqg/,1649986450,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1649957632.0,,,,

US wants this to last forever, its the second Afghanistan, they found sillies to fight on their behalf. Ukrainians already did what the US wanted, stay calm, keep \_civilians\_ in. Why did the civilians were NOT ask to go the moment this started on 2/24 or before ? Russians were practicing cohesive politics since -a-year-before-. the first buildup was in March 2021! So why not. Maybe having the attention of the world with people suffering would help the Ukrainian side. Whomever wanted to have this fight from the Ukrainian side should have been on the front line day ONE!  


I have zero vested interest in either side, as a mater of fact I hate both sides in this conflict not good people, I would actually dare to say that Russians were more humans than Ukrainians - holocaust wouldn't have happened without Ukrainian collaborators/nazis. PERIOD!  


if the Ukrainians wanted their state the should have said here's the east, never belonged to us, we take the West and we declare neutral. BUT no, little zelensky aka the crush of Midwest wives aka the Napoleon of Ukraine thought lets stick it to Russia or else these Azov guys stick it to me !   


Anyhow here's what's going to happen.  


1. if Russian don't achieve all they want they will carpet bomb stuff. I've watched things, they don't use anything similarly with what US used in the past, they can carpet bomb whole areas if they want. However, they seem to care about civilians, yet the west plays it that no they don't care, and Ukrainians don't let people leave the combat area. they want their own citizen to die so maybe a red line is going to be crossed!
2. if Russians achieve what they want in this SO/War Ukraine will be neutral, all the death and the destruction is going to be on the hands of those that could avoid it, territory will be loss. those that call Russians security need a joke those own this and the outcome.  

3. WW3 - End of Game!  


clearly Ukrainians though people give a shit. If Ukrainians want ""blood money"" not to reach Russia why don't they shut down North Stream ONE!   


Yep!   


Why ?  


Ukraine helps selling Russian oil and gas thru NS1 and they never stopped it!

You aren’t wrong though. Dropping the bomb was done for a number of reasons. It did not help that President Truman was also only in office for a couple months, tasked with completing a costly global war in the shadow of his predecessor. Truman was pretty green, and most likely decided to go with the flow and momentum that FDR had set in place with the atomic program. 

The number one reason I learned in uni is that Truman was incredibly worried about the backlash from the American public if they learned of the bomb’s existence and Truman’s choice to not use it - finding out that Truman had a Ace in the hole but chose to send thousands of lives in the conquering of Japan. And again, all of this is predicated on the fact that Japan agreed to surrender, it’s just that they only wanted to surrender on their terms. 

And truthfully, after learning about the number of atrocities committed by the Japanese against the Chinese, Koreans, and countless other Pacific peoples for decades - Japan needed a moral reckoning and wake up call.

3551.0,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,True,"You seem to be missing some key information:

1.  Russia has huge logistics issues.  That is one of the main reasons they're losing. They can't supply the men they already have in the field.  This isn't a video game.  You can't just hit the ""mobilize"" button and march your big army into Ukraine. They can't just shove a million men into an area where they are having trouble supporting 30K. You need food, shells, gas, clothes, showers, tents, sleeping bags, medicine, parts, etc.. and you need trucks and trains to deliver it. You can't just throw meat at the problem or you'll have a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field. Russia suffers mostly from a lack of equipment (and trained operators of that equipment), not manpower.   It isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around.  Usually it is better to have them as spares when you own guys get killed. 

2. Mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you need like I talked about in point #1. That is a more realistic thing that Russia needs. Reports indicate that Russia is doing that already to the best of their ability. Unfortunately for Russia there are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion and have been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc..). They might be able to field an army armed with AK-74's, boots, and some Kevlar, but that's it.  They're already having trouble equipping their current army with basics, trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. Also, Russia doesn't have a big economy.  They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They don't have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip anything near what they need the next few months (by which time the war may already be decided.)  

3. You need to train all these people or all you'd end up with is a bunch of conscripts with (likely) poor morale, training, etc.. who are a hinderance rather than a benefit. That takes time and the war might be over by then.  Russia is also performing poorly because their army fucking sucks at war.  If they're already having trouble training recruits to a minimum standard, how is attempting something far larger going to be an automatic improvement? You might just end up with 500K useless bodies at a huge cost. You need to scale your goals to something achievable and useful.

4. If you mobilize people for war and take them away from their normal jobs, you fuck over your economy and possibly make things worse in the long-term financially.  You need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war. 

5. Conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan).  Big surprise, people don't like being used as cannon fodder.  It might cause people to revolt, which is worse for Putin than losing the war. Legally, they can't send guys into an offensive war (or at least that's what has been reported). Putin himself has said they will not send conscripts. When reports did emerge about conscripts being caught in Ukraine he made a bunch of pronouncements and called for them to be immediately removed. He even made a big show about it. This seems like a sensitive issue politically. 

6. They are starting to push for a large involvement on Russian state TV. Or at least talk about the possible necessity of larger conscription. So it isn't like they don't understand they might need more troops in the future. They just also understand they need popular support for the idea. It is a hard sell to get people to agree to conscription when they don't believe in the cause and when you've already had trouble subduing Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of troops already. 

7. Before mobilization, activating semi-trained reserves is Step One.  Russia is already trying to do that.  

8. Russia has an immediate manpower problem now, due to the aforementioned legal issues. In the future however, it likely won't be a manpower problem, but instead a materiel problem.  Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate.  At some point, if Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with guns getting annihilated by Artillery, Tanks, SPGs, etc.. 

9. Russia has huge demographic issues.  Losing a ton of young people might break the country regardless of if it would win them the war.  All you'd achieve is a Pyrrhic victory.

Truman and his advisors knew that Stalin entering the war would cause the Japanese to surrender, and was urging him to do so. Meanwhile the Japanese were urging him to mediate a conditional surrender to avoid Hirohito being executed for war crimes.

This is all documented history, the problem is that the indoctrination runs too deep for most people, who've been taught that it took a miraculous scientific advancement to put down the Japanese will to fight but the truth just does not stand up to that scrutiny.

The US knew the bombs were unnecessary, but dropped them anyways, because the point of the bombing wasn't to force Japanese capitulation, but Soviet submission.

\- maybe they can't afford to call a full mobilization which means definitely a longer war with a possible escalation against NATO, something Putin will try to avoid.

\- Russian army struggled to manage and supply 200k troops in an invasion that required from a logistic standpoint to just pass their own border, so I don't know how they would handle a way bigger amount of troops. Also a full mobilization will give you a tons of troops but with limited to zero combat experience, so it would be a desperate move they will try to avoid. 

\- this one is an improbable scenario, but can't be left off the table: it's risky to put most of your army in one place leaving a huge part of your country without a decent military protection.

Yeah I know they have a 30mm cannon with a pretty high rate of fire but I am surprised how easily those penetrate the armor based on the explosions during impact. 

That would suck being a tanker thinking that only other tanks and ATGMs (which are fucking hanging from the back of every infantry dude it seems so they are PLENTIFUL) but I would have though those transports would have not posed that much of a threat to frontal armor.

Are they using tungsten or depleted uranium rounds?
