[],False,,rdj12345667910,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ox0jts9,False,False,"I assume from your argument you are a realist. Why do you assume that Russia and China are acting out of their core geopolitical interests and the West is acting out of some foolish moralist/ideological imperative? 

Russia possesses only a fraction of the military power of the Soviet Union. Now, assuming that Article 5 is credible (which I think it is), invading a NATO member is a red line which will start a conventional war that Russia has an extremely high likelihood of losing at best. At worst it would devolve into a nuclear exchange in which everyone loses. 

Now assuming Russia will avoid direct military confrontation with NATO, what does the West really gain by allowing Russia to have their sphere of influence and declining to expand NATO eastward? Expanding on that, when you look at the world today, Russia is economically ruined. NATO is more united then ever and Finland and Sweden are trying to join ASAP. Ukraine is now firmly anti-Russian and will move closer to the EU and NATO, and Russia is embarassing itself in Ukraine and has lost many more soldiers in two months then the Soviets lost in Afghanistan over 10 years. How is this a bad situation for the West? I of course dont want to minimize the loss of life in Ukraine, which is horrendous, but according to your argument - the West shouldn't even care if Russia dominates Eastern Europe and the Baltics because they aren't important enough strategically.

To answer your question, yes. NATO expansion into the Baltics and former Warsaw Pact countries does stop Russia from acting aggressively towards those NATO members. And while US support to Taiwan might not prevent China from military designs on Taiwan, it does give China pause and force them to carefully consider the potential costs of an invasion. As far as ""armed and neutral"" buffer zones - Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, etc cannot be neutral, they have a very powerful and aggressive neighbor on their doorstep with a long history of bullying its neighbors and who has made it clear that they will intervene if relations with the the West become too close. All these former Soviet states and ex-Warsaw Pact members have the choice of either the Belarus path or the Lithuania path. Finland isn't an option. 

I was not making the argument that 1930s Europe is comparable to today and nuclear brinksmanship. My original point was that granting concessions without concrete benefit is appeasement, similar to the 1930. You claimed that appeasement may have been a way for Britain and France to rearm and get prepared for future conflict, and I disagreed saying that the Allies relative combined strength was probably higher in 1936 and 1938 then 1939. 

As I stated in the beginning, the United States and the West always have these moralistic judgments applied to their geopolitical actions such as ""imperalist,"" ""hypocritical,"" ""arrogant,"" ""hubris,"" etc while everything Russia and China does is a geopolitical necessity to protect their core interests and sphere of influence? I don't buy the argument that NATO expansion caused Russian aggression, on the contrary, NATO membership prevents Russian aggression. The US and NATO have no desire for Barbarossa 2.0, the concept is ridiculous in a environment with nuclear weapons. What NATO does do however is threaten Putins ability to threaten, intimidate, and use military force on his neighbors without consequence. NATO and the West also offer a far more attractive economic and political alternative to the Russian model. Russia is a declining Great Power attempting to masquerade as a Superpower based solely on its nuclear arsenal and the decaying prestige of the former Soviet Union. 

As far as Finland and Sweden, why do they even feel threatened by Russia? They have a history of neutrality and are the exact embodiment of a ""armed and neutral"" buffer state. Furthermore, despite all the known risks, why did most former Warsaw Pact countries and former Soviet states pursue NATO membership and not a more comfortable/appeasing membership with the CSTO/CIS? 

Finally, I disagree with you on Article 5. Any power bold enough to openly invade a NATO country is a threat to the whole of Europe and would demand a military response from NATO and the US. Article 5 is the foundation of the security of the Western world and the liberal world order. For the US (or any NATO country) to abandon Article 5 would essentially be calling into question every treaty and alliance they have across the globe.",80e9b0d23e54973a4643982f4d473fb4f5f09733,True,False,,,,,0,1649978854,,0,{},i4rl9l6,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i4o5rvv,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4rl9l6/,1649978872,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649950054.0

I've noted that in another comment I made and it's indeed a large problem that both China and the borrowers need to act upon to reform. However, when discussing the specific case of Sri Lanka (as I do in my original comment), AidData found little to no evidence of any of this  ""hidden debt"" for Sri Lanka.

&gt;And though the airport in Uganda has not actually been repossessed, the lending contract collateralizes controlling stake in the airport to Chinese state lenders. Now, Uganda's debt load is well over 50 percent its GDP at this point and they are asking for debt restructuring, and again, as pointed out by AidData, it isn't clear how much of that debt is owed to the Chinese.

The point I'm trying to convey, and what's supported by AidData, is that China is not going to seize the Entebbe Airport.

In addition, it does not collateralize controlling stake in the airport to Chinese state lenders.

Rather: ""Instead, the borrower agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance in a lender-controlled bank account, giving China Eximbank access to a fully liquid source of collateral that it can unilaterally debit if the Government of Uganda defaults on its repayment obligations.""

Is this a problem? Absolutely, however, this also proves that the issue that the debt-trap diplomacy narrative describes is not really the main issue. Continuing to focus attention on an irrelevant fake issue is counterproductive to the real solution where

AidData source: https://docs.aiddata.org/reports/Uganda-Entebbe-Airport-China-Eximbank.html

&gt;And as far as Sri Lanka, the Chinese are the largest bilateral lender there, and once again, that is just in sovereign debt.

But again, the Chinese debt is a minority of all the debt Sri Lanka has. 

&gt;We don't know what those off-the-book debts are collateralized against.

AidData found little to no hidden debt in Sri Lanka

&gt;They funded the project by granting contracts for port development to Chinese contractors. 

That's not necessarily a problem and many other countries (I'm thinking Turkey) do this.

&gt;That project is a major reason why the country is in the situation it's in. 

Very few people think that. Sri Lanka was already is in a precarious financial situation prior to the loan. 

In addition, ""The Central Bank governors under both Rajapaksa and Sirisena do not agree on much, but they both told us that Hambantota, and Chinese finance in general, was not the source of the country’s financial distress.""

In addition, ""Of the $4.5 billion in debt service Sri Lanka would pay in 2017, only 5 percent was because of Hambantota.""

&gt;And that government sold the 99 year lease for more Chinese loans. What are those collateralized against?

The Sri Lankan government did not sell the lease for more Chinese loans. A Chinese firm pays for equity in the Port and there are no loans involved. If anything, any collateral involved would be in favor of the Sri Lankans (i.e. collateral that Sri Lankans can seize if the Chinese don't pay)",92685e16c55ae5724d1686df32021c1d58a351e3,True,False,,,,,0,1649968457,,0,{},i4qww60,False,t3_u2tyc7,False,True,t1_i4q0ph9,/r/geopolitics/comments/u2tyc7/what_happens_to_sri_lanka_or_any_country_when/i4qww60/,1649968473,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649939657.0

&gt;You seem to be saying that the larger debt a debtor already has the more likely a creditor is to give them good terms on further loans. But that is clearly false.

No, that's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that Sri Lanka has certain legal obligations related to their creditors and if they default on a European multilateral institution debt for example, they have a legal obligation to tell European creditors about it.

There's levels of who should be repaid first and this hierarchy of people that must be repaid must, legally speaking, be made clear to all creditors.

Again, there's the fact that AidData has found little to no evidence of hidden debt in Sri Lanka.

They all have charters and rules based on liberal principles. The UN Human Rights Council is meant to promote Human Rights, the WTO is meant to promote trade rules and the Security Council is meant to promote security.

Nations that want to promote liberal values through these systems shouldn't be worried, insecure and apologetic about promoting those values and need not shy away from it. And what weakens the system is when its members become weak about enforcing the rules and hesitant about promoting the values, which directly led to the demise of the League of Nations. The strength of the rules and the values is what attracts new member states and retains others, not weakness. 

Those who worry about a multipolar world order emerging or being unable to check China and Russia should not make it seem like this is some new peril we all need to worry about and do everything to avoid, including abandon our values. That was the case all throughout the cold war and GWOT and it is going to be the case as Europe moves forward dealing with Russia and the US-China conflict heats up in the Pacific. 

The international order of liberal states should be confident about its values and forceful about upholding the rules and charters of their international organizations, and it will remain a powerful force in the global community, attracting new member states and making them prosperous, just like with all of the former Soviet states and all of the Asian states that emerged from authoritarian rule. If China and Russia want to be a part of that then that's great, and if they don't, then let them be isolated from it.

The propagandists have stoked culture wars to create artificial ideological camps to argue about stuff like abortions or critical race theory, while in the background both parties work for the oligarchy.

1 The suspicion that AMLO is using the recall election and confirmation of his popularity as the basis for a campaign to remove Mexico’s single-term limit on the presidency. This term limit has been a long standing feature of the Mexican political structure, and so the idea of removing it obviously makes some people very uncomfortable. The idea of a populist president removing term limits to extend his time in power also echoes behavior seen in plenty of authoritarian countries that cements the ruling politicians’ power, and while I don’t think there’s any suggestion AMLO is trying to turn Mexico into a dictatorship or something it the association os certainly discomforting for people already opposed to AMLO

2 The expectation that AMLO’s party, Morena, will use recall elections in the future as a tool to remove presidents from other parties if they lose the presidential elections. Now arguably that’s the whole point of having recall elections, but you can certainly see why people would think subjecting presidents to the risk of recall would be harmful to the institutions of Mexican government and encourage them to govern with an eye on short term electoral success. 

I’d also note that AMLO is generally a very divisive and polarizing figure in Mexican politics, so my impression is that his opponents are not very inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt and his supporters are extremely supportive. This is an environment that makes people suspicious of institutional changes. Finally, while AMLO won like 90% of the vote in the recall, there was only 19% voter turnout since basically only his most diehard supporters actually voted.

So China does report all loans given by state owned banks (like the Eximbank). What you may be referring to is the idea of hidden debt that is perpetuated by private, commercial banks, some of which are Chinese.

AidData has done an extensive survey of this kind of debt and found little if any evidence of it in Sri Lanka. 

Furthermore, Sri Lanka's debt figures are based on what they report and they have a good incentive to report all existing debt because they have to pay it all and have an obligation to let other lenders know their capacity to pay it (which is affected by whether they have a lot of Chinese loans for example).

&gt;Because of useless (to Sri Lanka) infrastructure projects (in this case BRI projects) Sri Lanka increased their debt

This is a bit of a misunderstanding of the situation. Sri Lanka's financial situation meant that even without taking on the debt from the port, they would have had to gone to the IMF anyways. 

Did the Chinese debt increase their debt burden? Sure. But would they have needed to sell off strategic assets if they didn't have the Chinese debt? Also yes.

It's worth noting that had Rajapaksa followed the rollout plan that the original Canadian feasibility study proposed, there's a good chance Hambantota would have been significantly more profitable.

""There is very little Washington could have done to stave off challenges to the liberal order. Historically, integration into international institutions has not restrained countries hoping to challenge the status quo. To the contrary, it has enhanced their ability to mobilize allies, secure leverage over their trading partners, and gain legitimacy for their normative visions. It is not simply that international institutions were unlikely to check China’s and Russia’s revisionism; their membership in fact assisted their efforts to transform world politics.  
On the other hand, it is a mistake to dismiss institutional integration as a complete failure. If judged by the high ambitions set by U.S. policymakers, who thought that incorporating expansionist powers into international institutions would temper their ambitions, then it has not lived up to its promise. But judged by a more reasonable standard, it has succeeded: although institutional integration can’t prevent revisionism, it can shape the strategies revisionists use. Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated that countries bent on expansionism will charge ahead regardless, on the whole, international institutions can channel this aggression so that it doesn’t devolve into bloodshed. Rather than giving up on institutions, then, Western policymakers should adopt a realistic approach to them. While they may not lead to completely harmonious relations, they can be a potent tool for preventing war.  
A strategy of institutional realpolitik would also recognize that for all their coordination, China and Russia are very different types of revisionists. China’s assaults have been less violent but in many ways more consequential; where Moscow has relied on strategies of disruption and violence, Beijing has preferred to exert influence through growing networks and its position within international institutions. That is why the one-size-fits-all strategy of the past fell short—and why a new approach is called for. To that end, the United States needs to see international institutions not as a way to transform the fundamental nature of its rivals but as places that can become better forums for communicating preferences, resolving disputes, and establishing clear redlines.

In essence Russia is public enemy number 1, China is difficult balancing act to manage due to the conflicting concerns of security and an ongoing trade relationship, and there is a clear tilt to the Indo-Pacific 

Their approach to Europe is possibly best summarised in this [paper](https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/the-bilateralisation-of-british-foreign-policy) which suggests the approach of forming bilateral security relations with European nations may be bearing fruit in areas outside of defence.

And this is the key point. Bilateral (or in this case trilateral) defence relations are part and parcel of British foreign policy and this was the case long before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The UK is not trying to re-establish an empire, it isn't trying to save face over Brexit, and this is not about lockdown parties.

Winston Churchill often made the point that at this time Germany was still weak, and if Britain and France had acted together, in force, then Hitler would have been forced to withdraw his troops, and without occupation of the Rhineland, then World War II would not have been possible. 

I think the same strategic thinking applies here: we can stop Putin in Ukraine, therefore let's stop him in Ukraine. 

Why would we want to let him conquer Ukraine, and then consolidate his power? As things stand now, Ukraine will probably destroy Putin, therefore it makes sense for the democracies to do what they can to ensure Putin's defeat right now. After all, he is no friend to democracies. 

But if Putin win's in Ukraine, he has learned some powerful lessons, and so he will grow stronger.

At that time, Britain controlled India and parts of modern day Pakistan and Afghanistan -- but parts of these countries still belonged to Iran (the Persian Empire used to be much larger than what Iran is now). 

Likewise, Iran controlled much of the Caucus region, including Baku. Russia conquered this area in the mid to late 1800s. 

Britain attacked Iran and conquered the remaining parts of what we now consider Pakistan and Afghanistan. 

Both Russia and Britain were worried that the other country would end up in full control of Iran. Britain considered a full invasion of Iran, to keep Russia from getting it. 

For awhile, Russia was able to develop excellent diplomatic relations with the Shah of Iran. Russia saw no need to invade, as the Shah became an ally. 

But all of that changed with the Iranian revolution of 1906, and the establishment of a democratic republic in Iran. Russia was terrified by the idea of having a successful democracy on its border and so Russia worked to sabotage democracy in Iran. 

Britain was later to get oil concessions from Iran. 

I don't mean to focus on just Iran, but my point is, Britain and Russia were locked in a struggle for control of all Asia, all during the 1800s and early 1900s.

&gt;Lastly, the Chinese are able to see the American sanctions 'playbook' as it were. The US has pulled out all the stops against the Russians and the Chinese have seen that essentially, the West is a paper tiger.

I don't see how you get this out of the current situation. The arguably #2/3 military power is having issues invading their land-border neighbor with support of an allied nation who is a 100 mile drive from their capital. The US force commitments are small, even the gifted weapons are small. At the high end the US gave the UAF ~20% of it's javelin reserves. If the US could spend 100 billion dollars to neuter Russia conventionally it would be worth the price, but right now they are effectively destroying their 2nd largest geopolitical rival for 5 billion.


&gt;Russia is navigating itself through all the brambles and China will be able to prepare appropriately before it moves on Taiwan.

Except the US will now have a chance to truly pivot to Asia. Russia will not be a conventional threat for a decade after this war, no matter who wins.

I wouldn't describe Russia/West relations as a lost cause at all. I mean Japan went from enemy nr 1 to close ally, so why couldn't Russia? Putin/the current Russian leadership is the only lost cause here (of course I harbor no illusions that regime change will happen). 

I agree that this is bigger than UKR and is esentially Putin actively taking a stand against ""the west""/the current world order. And as I said previously, I don't think this is a wise strategic move (even when seen strictly from the perspective of maximizing Russian power and influence). Only time will tell of course, but throwing all your eggs in with China is a pretty high stakes move. So, sure I suggest giving up and going low profile, but I sincerely believe it would be the rational choice for Russia as a state (and not as some form of western comeuppance/schadenfreude).

As a ""western"" European I also find it very hard to grasp Russian security concerns over NATO etc. I mean I can understand the logic and history, but the undertones of the ""encroaching"" west slowly invading Russia just seems paranoid. I have never in my life heard anyone express the will to conquer or subjugate Russia. So Russian talking points of ""NATO encroachment"" just sound like sour grapes of wanting, but not being able to, maintain your sphere of influence. Or as shallow rationalizations for a dictators moves of aggression or coersion. From my perspective Russias actions are based on what is best for Putin, not the Russian people.

[],False,,MauritanianHistory,,,[],,,,text,t2_3g8sklbz,False,False,"&gt; Giving up concessions without getting any concrete concessions or security guarantees in return is appeasement, especially in the context of an aggressive or expansionist power.

This is the issue: the West never gave Russia any concessions with regards to NATO or asked for anything in return. The closest thing to an agreement with Russia over NATO expansion was to let them be an observer and the famous ""not one inch east"" verbal promise. Read any news about Putin and NATO prior to 2013 and you will find countless attempts by Russia to cooperate and find a workable modus vivendi between NATO and Russia that would satisfy both parties, and you will also find that the West was simply not interested. They were interested in NATO expansion, and knew that Russia didn't have the diplomatic or economic means to stop it, and played chicken with Russia until it decided on a military solution.

&gt;As far as Taiwan, I think a peaceful reunification is unlikely at this point. 

It really depends on too many things for me to be sure either way. Taiwan may see a decline in economic relevance because of its precarious position (look at other nations trying to end their reliance on its superconductors for example). Chinese military action against Taiwan is a method of last resort, what they're relying on is their economic gravity to pull in various regional actors (Indonesia for example), and over time to seek some kind of understanding with Taiwan that will allow them to incorporate it in the long run. But in truth China's decision-making there relies a lot on Xi's personal and political timetable.

&gt;What I am saying is that there is a reality of realpolitik that Superpowers and Great Powers generally do not give concessions to rivals in exchange for nothing but the ""hope"" of peace.

I think you misunderstood what I meant by ""granting"" powers stuff. What I mean is to correctly identify what it is *they* are willing to come to blows over that you are not, and working out a concrete and mutually-beneficial deal that is better than the alterative of armed conflict.

&gt;As far as Versailles, in my mind the issue was that it was strong enough to make the Germans feel slighted, but not strong enough to prevent their rearmament. 

Has U.S support for Taiwan stopped Chinese military designs on it? Has NATO expansion into small and strategically inconsequential states stop Russia from becoming a hostile great power, or instigated it? It would be one thing if Russia had invaded the Baltics or Ukraine prior to tranches of NATO expansion - then NATO may calculate whether balancing Russia in those nations is too costly to European security and if they should give them an Article 5 guarantee. Montenegro is not the axis on which peace between great powers pivots on. The purpose of keeping such states neutral is to give a space between the great powers to maneuver and balance without being eyeball-to-eyeball if one of them decides to become aggressive.

&gt; My point is the situation was probably better for Britain and France in 1936, 1937, amd 1938 then it was in 1939.

This is an analogy that is **severely** limited. First of all - war between the USA and Russia is not desirable even if it somehow ends in a Russian loss. Whatever is left of either country, or the world, isn't worth it. So if Hitler and Chamberlain both had nuclear weapons, I don't think we'd be arguing that it would have been more advantageous to declare war in 1936 instead of 1939. The nuclear factor alone makes Munich an ill-fitting and overly-used analogy. 21st century great power politics is much better suited looking to the Cold War for guidance.

&gt;Certainly the US and NATO would have preferred warmer relations with Russia 

The ball was in their court in that regard.

&gt;That said, there were valid concerns that a resurgent Russia could dominate its neighbors in the future.

What does it matter that they do ""dominate"" Latvia or Ukraine? As long as security guarantees to important nations like Poland are in effect? Are the Europeans going to risk a war against the U.S.A to guarantee that it does not dominate Bolivia? No. Russia views ""Europe whole and free"" as a pernicious march of U.S-German-French-Italian economic imperialism and a strategy in the Pentagon's quest to remake the world in the American image, as they tried to do in Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere.

&gt; I am not discounting diplomacy and trying to foster good international relationships, but from a security perspective those are not concrete and can change with time.

I agree, but so can the linchpins of current European collective security.

&gt;Can we really say with confidence that if NATO hadn't expanded in the 90s, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania wouldn't be experiencing the same situation we're witnessing in Ukraine right now?

No, and we don't need to. I am talking about serious initiatives to avoid conflict between great powers, not the propagation of some kind of peace-for-all-times schemes that must be extended to every man in and whole and free Europe. If Russia had invaded Ukraine or Latvia in the early 2000s, the question of why they invaded would be paramount to the question of how to respond and how it affects the great power relationship.

&gt;Furthermore, why are non-NATO countries close to Russia such as Finland and Sweden scrambling to join Nato? If they are not a part of NATO currently (and thus not a security threat to Russia), why do they feel the urgent need to join NATO?

They did not view Russia to be sufficiently aggressive to warrant their joining NATO until this latest development, which by itself should tell you about the reality of Russian intentions and behavior prior to 2008. In fact, you should read about why the Swedes and Fins didn't join NATO after the 2008 Russian intervention in Georgia - they laid much of the blame on NATO for creating the problem.

What you should also ask is this: is NATO really deterring Russia in some of these states? Is Washington actually going to fight World War III over *Montenegro* or *Latvia*? Because a view that I am slowly coming around to is that NATO expansion was an extremely foolish opportunistic policy and that there is really no serious political will among the U.S public or the Pentagon to undertake an immensely costly conventional war in the Baltics, even if Europeans bear the brunt of the cost. And if Article 5 protection for these states is a bluff that Russia calls, it could lead to the collapse of NATO. If it isn't a bluff... well we'll at least have better literature on nuclear escalation going forwards, if there is anyone left to write or read it.",b750307cff3bbb87d412637b6a48102f7b977861,True,False,,,,,0,1649918669,,0,{},i4o5rvv,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i4mara3,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4o5rvv/,1649918680,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649889869.0

[],False,,Harmonic_Strategy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cpdderd,False,False,"&gt;What's the support scenario for Taiwan? On the US side you have one, maybe two carrier groups and no stockpiles or military transport capacity. Civilian ships won't go near once shooting starts.

The USA has 11 strike carrier groups right now. How do you go from 11 to 1?

&gt;China can send fighters and missiles galore to bomb all the infrastructure into submission, the whole island is flying distance.

Russia can send fighters and missiles galore to bomb all the infrastructure into submission, the whole country is flying distance.

&gt;Detection range is global, bomber range a few thousand miles.

Real war isn't like hearts of iron. You don't just draw a circle on a map based on operational range. You have to actually control the airspace, which means massive and complex coordination, screening, and refuel. How many pacific airbases does China have to contest aeronaval supremacy?

Also, detection range is only global if you have satelite coverage. 

&gt;It's also not fighting Japan that had far less technology and an entirely resource starved home base. 

China also relies massively on overseas resources and trade lines. 

&gt;Historically US is big on promises but not really a reliable ally in the face of costly decisions. 

Meaning no offense, this is so generic it could apply to any large nation-state. Can you name one great power for which this statement is false? For counterexamples, South Korea (un mandate too), Kuwait, Russia (honoring secret agreement that ended Cuban missile crisis).

&gt;China can impose massive cost on the US. No Chinese exports would totally cripple the US economy.

The damage is symmetrical at least. Large amount of Chinese wealth is invested in US (real estate, bonds, stock) and would be frozen or wiped out. Loss of trade would be bad enough for China's factories, but a resource shock from say a blockaded Malaysian Strait would be ruinous.

&gt;China has fuel, soldiers, guns, artillery in plenty, no need for super high tech weapons.

Taiwan is an island. Soldiers don't just magically turn into boats. China needs air and naval supremacy across the Strait before anything else matters. A few troop transports sunk and you've got a couple tens of thousands of casualties to explain back home (or more families to monitor and suppress dissent).

&gt;Urban fights can be avoided if you use the Russian method and mostly flatten cities.

To clarify, you are using the current Russian strategy as an example of a good, useful and viable set of military tactics? And not obsolete garbage that has failed all the primary objectives so far?

Also not really accurate. Russia has been destroyed in urban fights but also peripheral skirmishes and rural operations.

&gt;You can even try decapitation strikes on city level.

If we're talking about just lobbing nuclear weapons at cities to systematically murder the whole population - I mean sure China could do this. At the risk of irradiating its own coastline, destroying all the strategic utility of its target, etc. Also NATO and probably India and maybe even Russia would likely respond in kind to this kind of behavior, that level of threat is too scary to ignore even if the price is mutual annihilation. And the same would be true in reverse against the USA or anyone else. You might as well start talking about doomsday AI takeover, directed asteroid strikes, alien / lizardpeople infiltration of the CCP, and other scifi apocalypse scenarios at that point.

&gt;Even if the US have a staging zone in Japan and the Philippines, post WW2 the US never had to fight a country that had means to take out their carriers or bases.

On the converse,, China hasnt had to fight a country with carriers since WW2, which imperial Japan was occupying large parts of China before they attacked Pearl Harbor (unfortunately and tragically for Chinese people). China lost against Vietnam, stalemated in Korean War, won against Tibet (population of about 1 million).",b93d191e300ef2d765bc275296bca243c855bb04,True,False,,,,,0,1649910029,,0,{},i4nt8iy,False,t3_u23uah,False,True,t1_i4klm5u,/r/geopolitics/comments/u23uah/would_china_and_the_pla_be_any_more_competent/i4nt8iy/,1649910046,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649881229.0

In 2001 Argentina defaulted on his debt and did not started to repay his lenders until 2005. The economy collapsed, the government limited withdrawals form banks to a very small amount because it didn't had the dollars to give to the people. This caused riots on the streets, martial law was declared, there were mass looting in multiple cities, the police was ordered to repress the chaos and dozens of people were killed.

The government fell, and 4 more after that one in just 11 days. Nobody from any political party had any support, the chant on the streets was ""they all have to go away"" (meaning all politicians). Finally a new government was able to lift the restrictions on the banks by devaluating the argentinian peso by more than 300% (if you had 100.000 dollars in the bank, you now have 30000). That stopped imports because people less than 1/3 of the dollars to spend in imported goods and many lost their job so they couldn't buy anything so local companies were not spending dollars in manufacturing supplies either and a large percentage went out of business or had to be sold to foreign companies.

In the next 2 years poverty skyrocket to 50% and unemployment to 25%. Local governments didn't have any money to pay their employees so they printed their own currencies called ""Patacones"", so there were numerous ""currencies"" at the same time for years. Because of the chaos, people resorted to bartering in mass. Nobody could get any credit. Even massive international companies were issuing food ""ballots"" as part of payment that you could exchange only in a few places. 

Lenders sued Argentina and confiscated many foreign assets such as a ship from the navy that was in Africa doing a training mission. Argentina could not get access to credit for many years and when it did, it was at an interest rate at least 2 times higher than other Latin American countries.

Finally, the massive devaluation plus less spending in dollars by the population plus not paying the massive debt plus rising prices in Argentina's exports reverted the situation by 2003.",42e7e49a800a92a8bf3e1dcffc9bd2db7996dd2b,True,False,,,,,0,1649903889,,0,{},i4nhgn3,False,t3_u2tyc7,False,True,t3_u2tyc7,/r/geopolitics/comments/u2tyc7/what_happens_to_sri_lanka_or_any_country_when/i4nhgn3/,1649903904,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649875089.0

US politicians don't actually expect China to split from Russia, it's simply to make Europe see China as condoning Russia.",e621f758d70f63c9b3a2f9ee034ce338553a25c9,True,False,,,,,0,1649899648,,0,{},i4n82wz,False,t3_u23uah,False,True,t1_i4mkdwz,/r/geopolitics/comments/u23uah/would_china_and_the_pla_be_any_more_competent/i4n82wz/,1649899660,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649870848.0

Definitely false. China wins an enormous amount from this conflict (both economically and militarily) and it's naive to assume that Xi didn't green-light the invasion. It's clear from their meeting schedules, trade decisions and open solidarity that this scenario had been discussed at the highest levels of both regimes prior to its enactment.",8f6fb17c779021b45c5744300c217619768a8323,True,False,,,,,0,1649897972,,0,{},i4n49zc,False,t3_u2y88a,False,True,t1_i4mejzi,/r/geopolitics/comments/u2y88a/how_has_the_war_in_ukraine_affected_the_soft/i4n49zc/,1649897984,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649869172.0

[],False,,tuesdaycocktail,,,[],,,,text,t2_3wcvkcph,False,False,"Very interesting again (thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts on this!). What you’re basically saying is that it’s pretty much a lost cause for Russia anyways with the west so Putin should change course, essentially give up and go into low profile mode. Interesting. 

The way I see it, building from my thinking that Putin is a highly tactful and calculative thinker, he might’ve underestimated or miscalculated a lot of things about this war - but he must’ve been highly aware of the unpredictability associated with disrupting world order, and took the risk anyways. Point being, if he was _that_ determined to invade an internationally recognized sovereign nation, this must be Putin’a fight until I die-battle. So with this, if I was him, I’d double down on my bet. Since my economic, political and cultural ties are being cut by the west anyways at this point, and we still haven’t reached agreement on fundamental values on security issues, then why bang my head against the wall? I’d turn my attention to the global south (primarily China, India and the entire Silk Road, UAE etc) for trade and alliance. Our shared interest would be diversifying the west’s domination in world order by shaking up power dynamics and ultimately, redefining concepts from foreign security policy to governance models. 

This is why I don’t see this so much as a 1-1 war as I see it as a larger power dynamic-shake up between two very different “value systems”. And because of this, while I of course hope Putin would stop immediately, I doubt he will because what is there for him to get back to? Show his wounds and try to rebuild trust with the west? 

Obviously, this is a tricky tricky situation and there is no easy way out. I guess only time will tell which side of the history we were on.",97af77e7d02a6040dffc587951503c170d3130d9,True,False,,,,,0,1649895947,,0,{},i4mzlmm,False,t3_u1nr41,False,True,t1_i4jyxyk,/r/geopolitics/comments/u1nr41/finland_and_sweden_and_considering_joining_nato/i4mzlmm/,1649895966,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649867147.0
