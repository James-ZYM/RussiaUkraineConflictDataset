It alleges significant NATO intelligence assistance in the planning and execution of the attack.

&gt; The attack on the Moscow missile cruiser is only a harbinger of a change in the military situation in the region.

&gt; In recent weeks, I have repeatedly written that the Black Sea Fleet will become a priority target for the new phase of the campaign.  This was understandable from a military point of view: the active operations of the Black Sea Fleet west of Crimea is a constant threat of amphibious assault, more effective fire support for ground forces by reducing the flight time of subsonic cruise missiles, as well as a threat factor for sea communications near Odessa, which is detrimental both for  for the Ukrainian economy, and for the Western one (if, say, we are talking about shipping through the port of neon, which is necessary for the world microelectronics industry).  This is even more understandable from the point of view of media symbolism - the death of ships is always perceived by the public more tangibly than the death of entire units;  this fact is perfectly confirmed by today's shock state of the Russian media sphere.

&gt; Moscow's attack was not an accident or improvisation - the cruiser was chosen as a target for both technical and propaganda reasons. On the one hand, this is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, on the other hand, it is a ship that is deeply outdated, worn out by long service and chronic underfunding.

&gt; The strike on the Moscow was well planned and thought out: it was carried out in stormy conditions in order to complicate the ship's damage control and crew evacuation operations as much as possible;  moreover, he was at a distance from other ships of the Black Sea Fleet. According to transponders, only 5 boats of an unknown type could come to the aid of the cruiser.

&gt; As I assumed earlier, the operation was carried out in full cooperation of the Ukrainian Navy with the Allied forces: for example, according to airspace monitoring data for April 12, the British RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft was actively operating in the Black Sea area, and RQ UAV flights were also recorded at different times RQ-4 Global Hawk (map included).  On that day, NATO intelligence confirmed the presence of the Moscow, verified the signatures, and received comprehensive data on the whereabouts of other ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation.

&gt; On April 13 (the day of the attack), some kind of military magic happened - data on the flights of the RC-135 and RQ-4 is simply not available.  The reason for this is that air reconnaissance aircraft flew with transponders turned off, and civilian airspace monitoring devices could not detect them, which in itself is more than a clear reconnaissance sign.

&gt; The missile attack on the cruiser was carried out using the Neptune missile defense system, a modern missile system made using military microelectronics manufactured in Western Europe (and, naturally, it was able to receive external target designation from NATO reconnaissance aircraft).  Various conspiracy theories about the use of the Norwegian Penguin anti-ship missiles are complete nonsense.  This missile is intended only for aviation and naval carriers and, doubly important, it has an extremely limited range of use (34 km in the Mk2 mod.).

&gt; Above, I mentioned the poor technical condition of the Moscow - and this is not an accident.  Previously, the cruiser could not undergo repairs and maintenance for several years, and the Ministry of Defense refused to modernize it.  In practice, this means that the Moscow was a ship with VERY outdated equipment and weapons - the ability of the missile cruiser to repel missile strikes raises legitimate questions. Judging by a number of data, Bayraktar UAVs also took part in the attack on the cruiser, acting as a means of carrying out a distracting maneuver.

&gt; At the moment, the fate of ""Moscow"" is still unknown.  I will not dispute the words of the Russian Ministry of Defense - I will only say that simultaneously declaring ""munitions detonation"" and that ""the ship is intact"" is perhaps not the best move, given the nature of the cruiser design.

&gt; The Moskva incident, however, is deeply symbolic - it shows that a new campaign for control of the Black Sea has begun.

&gt; In conclusion, I will say the following: do not be proud of the fact that Russia ""opposes all the might of the West."" This is not so - the Russian Federation so far opposes only the strategists, analysts and intelligence officers of NATO.

&gt; And this confrontation brings us to extremely disappointing conclusions.",cc4af0a96cca8693d7735b6870a87aca4b75dae5,True,False,,,,,0,1649980158,,0,{},i4ro5q0,False,t3_u3fvip,False,True,t3_u3fvip,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3fvip/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_14_2022/i4ro5q0/,1649980170,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649951358.0,

Do we actually have evidence of that, or is it just hand-waving? I'm looking up actual combat history. I'm not totally up to speed on that. 

As far as I can tell, it is better than a M60 (mostly due to the Iraq-iran war - but that could be a doctrine problem), which was designed about 15 years earlier, but is severely outclassed by the M1 Abrams (which was only released 7 years later). 

In that hypothetical case, Russia may have been able to take over Germany in the early 70s. The USA just had a very successful campaign in Korea (I'd argue the stalemate was a major military victory) and had waged a large war in Vietnam for nearly a decade. Both of which were thousands of miles away from the USA. And probably the bulk of Russia's forces would have been earlier T64s, not T72s. Which may have been outclassed by contemporary European tanks or ATGMs. 

I have serious doubts that Russia would have been able to militarily project their power far outside of bullying neighbors. They simply didn't have those types of logistics. And even though the T72 was a decent tank, it still suffered from a lot of the same problems of the T34, crew survivability was bad, and production of soviet era tech just wasn't very good, so I'd expect their reliability to be quite poor. Additionally, it seems like the T72 was always outclassed by M60 Optics. Which IMO is probably one of the most important parts of the tank. The Russians just seem to forget optics...

To top that all off, apparently the T72 was vulnerable to frontal RPG-18 attacks during the Chechen wars. That is not a good indication of it's armor as the T72 was introduced the same year. 

The bottom line, I am very hesitant to call any Russian tech good at this point. I would like to see hard evidence for that, because it seems like a lot of military historians and analysts have been swayed by Russian propaganda and/or sales pitches. Which seems to be exposed right now.",47dc3a3b1436257782dd448771d1596c2051be43,True,False,,,,,0,1649976057,,0,{},i4rex41,False,t3_u3fvip,False,True,t1_i4r9dvj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3fvip/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_14_2022/i4rex41/,1649976072,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649947257.0,

Its important, IMO, to recognize in this conversation that Russia is using a *lot* of legacy equipment in its invasion. The T-72BM3 is just a heavily modernized late 1970s variant of the T-70, same with the T-80, the U is about as old as the Abrams. The T-90 is much newer, but is increasingly looking like a paper tiger, basically a new-built BM3. These weapons systems were designed to fight in what was, ultimately, a very unique environment. The German front of a hypothetical WWIII fought in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The Soviets did not play at war, and they designed their equipment to fight a very unique kind of battle. Everything was backed up with far more training than the Russians today receive, better doctrine, a generally higher quality of equipment, better morale and a more through indoctrination of the average soldier. The Soviets had a solid system designed to conquer Germany. In my opinion, there are times when they could have done it. Say in the early 1970s when the T-72 was cutting edge tech. 

But something happened. The computer revolution fucked the USSR hard, they couldn't compete. Because primarily the personal computing revolution in the west was driven by consumer culture. Nobody *needed* powerful PCs to type out college papers when a typewriter would do. Nobody *needed* home game and arcade games, it was just something fun (and immensely profitable). But underneath all this, western consumer trends drove innovation in electronics production, which in turn lowered the cost and opened up new areas of development for military production, which in turn lowered the cost and opened up new areas for consumer production. Ad infinatum. In 1992 you could go into a Texas Arcade and for $5/10min sit in a Battletech branded simulator, become immersed in the cockpit of a fictional mech, and fight in a networked real time battle with your friends in several more Battlepods across the arcade. Meanwhile the Russian Airforce had none of this for its own frontline pilots. And why would it, its not like Moscow needed a Battletech center. 

In terms of the military balance Russia missed out on the second generation of PGMs that dominated the late 1980s. By the time they got their development cycle started in the late 1980s, things were in crisis. If you look, many of these dreaded weapons systems like the S-300, the T-72BM3, and the SU-27/-35 series all got their starts in the late-Cold War, but were paused thanks to the collapse of the USSR. When Putin got into office he revived the Russian military and pumped money into all kinds of projects, both realistic (such as the S-300) and prestige (such as the Kuznetsov). But something else had disappeared with the fall of the USSR. The system which made the T-72 and the SU-27 and the S-300 all make sense. The USSR had a very clear vision of what it needed to achieve, what it had on hand, and how that could potentially impact western militaries. We can of course debate the merits of that system and wonder whether it would have really worked or not. Dissenting minds and all that. But I think its unsustainable to suggest that the USSR was off the page re: its tech, it was a very credible threat especially in the early 1970s period. But Putin kept the old weapons, sans any upgrades, and ditched a system which honestly no longer made sense for where Russia was. But while the USSR was collapsing and Putin was rebuilding, the west was continuing to innovate and build on its successes. The third generation of PGMs, the first generation of stealth and drone tech, and the doctrine/system to go with it. That is to say, the modern Russian military would have posed a substantial risk to the Coalition militaries in '91. But by the 21st century it was again behind, and its stayed behind. While it innovates, it does so to catch up with the west, and only then unevenly. Take the T-14, which is the first indigenous new tank design since the T-80. Even if we set aside questions like 'does it work,' in six years Russia hasn't produced enough of them to field even one BTG for this war. Oryx reports not one T-14 loss. This is really the Russian predicament. They have so much kit that they dont need, kit they have to try (and fail) to maintain. Its great for an export market because: fuckem.

This would include the idea of Ukraine as a separate nation with its own identity, language, and future. It was to be subsumed into Russia, and its people forcibly russified.

This according to Russian state media, and speeches by Putin himself.

They might attempt to take the donbass, which is potentially within their capabilities, as a face-saving Pyrrhic victory, but they will have inherited a world where the whole of eastern Europe and most of the EU will have a stated foreign policy goal of *Imperium Russicum Delenda Est.*

There will never again be trade in oil between Europe and the current Russian Federation. No visa access. No access to markets. No return of the wealth seized from the oligarchs who pilfered it.

Russia will be isolated. Its young bright things will flee to the west. They'll go on vacation to China or India, and then book flights to the US, where they'll apply for Asylum. They will do everything they can to escape.

And so a generation of inventors, scientists, and engineers, like the ones who gave the US Sikorsky and Republic Aviation. Everyone knows the name Sikorsky. Fewer know the names Alexander Kartveli, or Alexander Nikolaievich Prokofiev de Seversky, who were key people at Republic aviation.

If Kerensky or the Democratic Socialists had won that civil war, and Russia went down a path of returning to one of its two roots, the democratic Novgorodian tradition, WWII could have seen a scenario where it was Russia with its oil wealth that launched the P-47 thunderbolt.

They would have been the first power with operational helicopters made by Sikorsky. Instead, they went down the path of Ivan the Terrible, with secret police forces and slaughter. 

And Putin is once again spurning a bright, democratic future that would have seen Russia become the intellectual and technological powerhouse it absolutely could be, in favor of a dark future of blood and slaughter which sees the very people Russia needs to claim status as a great nation of the world flee that nation because they want to live in a country where they won't be jailed for criticizing the government.

The very people Putin believed would come to his soldiers aid are the ones his soldiers are raping and brutalizing. Ukraine, including eastern Ukraine, are now permanently out of Russia's reach as a docile, friendly, Novarossia.

They might take and keep some territory. That is a distinct possibility. But the economic damage they'll take, and the lost decades of progress they're about to face, along with the self inflicted brain drain they're about to experience, means that Russia is already defeated.

They might take some territory, sure. But there will be no victory in this war for them.

Their best possible future is Putin being overthrown, but short of that extremely unlikely outcome, their best future under Putin's regime and the people likely to replace him are as a client state of the People's Republic of China, who will be interested only in keeping them just stable enough to be a docile, subservient client state. 

They won't see an era like the 2000s, when new skyscrapers started to rise in Russian cities, and the future looked bright. China will want them frozen, stagnant, and dependent. Both to repay them for their part in the century of humiliation, and to guarantee that they never again force China to undermine its far more valuable trade relations with the west by providing minimal cover for some Russian misadventure. Russia will lose its autonomy as an independent actor, and be brought within the Chinese sphere of influence.

That is probably the best possible outcome in this scenario for Russia, due to the self inflicted wounds it will receive from this conflict.",7bf4e2526642683b5909788a8db550f011588df5,True,False,,,,,0,1649972441,,0,{},i4r6muk,False,t3_u3fvip,False,True,t1_i4r0mj9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3fvip/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_14_2022/i4r6muk/,1649972460,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649943641.0,

[],False,,long_time_lurker_01,,,[],,,,text,t2_ieemz,False,False,"A YEAR ago we ventured to hint that it might be worthwhile for Europe to go to war with Russia for the sake of information — in order to ascertain that is whether her strength was that of the bully or the giant — whether she was really entitled to dictate and domineer as she habitually did — whether, in a word, she was mighty in virtue of her own inherent force, or only in virtue of the ignorant timidity of her foes and rivals. We pointed out several notable sources of weakness in her institutions; we directed attention to the fact that nearly all her great acquisitions had been secured not by fighting but by bullying and intriguing; that diplomacy and not war had always been her favourite weapon; that she kept up such an enormous army on paper that all secondary States had arrived at the conclusion that resistance to her will was hopeless, but that in general she bad carefully abstained from coming into actual armed collision with any first rate Power. We expressed an opinion, too, that there was no reason whatever to suppose that her armies were as effective now as in 1815, when they were supported by the subsidies of England and trained and disciplined by wars with France; and we ventured to surmise that when they came into actual conflict with competent forces and skillful commanders they would exhibit a degree of feebleness and failure that would cause general amazement. Our suspicions have now been more than realized. […]

This unexpected weakness of Russia in military matters arises from four concurring causes, of which three are inherent in her system, and, if not absolutely incurable, are at least little likely to be cured.

In the first place, the nature of the country and the want of roads. Her resources may be vast but they are scattered and remote. Her forces may be immense, but they are necessarily in great measure distant from the scene of action. […]

Secondly. The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the official purse, but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything necessary to the action of a soldier. The colonels of regiments and officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible — inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the between these figures. They have an interest also in the men being as inadequately fed and clothed as possible — inasmuch they pocket the difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended on the soldiers’ rations and accoutrements. The Emperor provides (or believes he does) for the food, clothing, lodging, arms and ammunition of 5 or 600,000 men; but every one of these who is or can be made non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest official or officer; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the major; every ammunition waggon which is paid for by Government, but not provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor. Robbery and peculation of this sort is universal, in every rank, in every district, in every branch. It runs through every department in the Empire; and its operation upon the efficiency of the military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily exaggerated.

This horrible and fatal system originates in two sources — both, we fear, nearly hopeless, and certainly inherent in Russian autocracy;— the rooted dishonesty of the national character. and the incurable inadequacy of despotic power. Cheating, bribery, peculation pervade the whole tribe of officials, and are, in fact, the key-note and characteristic of the entire administration. There seems to be no conscience, and not much concealment, about it. The officers are ill paid, and of course pay themselves. Regard for truth or integrity has no part in the Russian character. We have heard those who know them well say that there are only three honest men in the Empire:— Woronzow is one, Nesselrode another — and men differ about the name of the third. We have heard Statesmen, who strongly incline towards a Muscovite alliance, say that the Russians are liars above all things: it is their spécialité. Then the power of the Autocrat, absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised, is utterly insufficient to meet the evil. What can a despot do who has no instruments that can be trusted? There is no middle class who pay the taxes and insist upon knowing how they are expended. There is no free Press, with its penetrating and omniscient vigilance, to compel honesty and drag offenders to light and retribution. There is only one eye over all: and that eye can of course see only a small corner of this vast Empire. What the Emperor looks at, or can visit, is well done: everything else is neglected or abused. It is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralisation and barbarism combined.

Thirdly. The common soldiers, brave and hardy as they are, devoted to their Czar, and careless of privation, have no love for their profession, and no interest in the object of the war. If we except the household regiments, who are near the person of the Emperor, the Russian private has no zeal for glory, no taste for fighting, no pleasure in bold and exciting enterprises. He is serf, seized by the conscription, and condemned to hopeless slavery for life. He is torn from his family and his land, drilled by the knout, neglected by his officers, fed on black bread, where fed at all, always without comforts, often without shoes. How can such troops be expected to make head,— we do not say against French enthusiasm, we do not say against British resolution, we do not say against fanatical and hardy mountaineers, like Schamyl and his warriors, — but even against courageous well fed Turks, fighting for their country and their faith, and officered by competent commanders? We need not wonder to read that at Oltenitza and Silistria the Russians had to be on to the assault with menaces and blows; that general had to sacrifice their lives in an unprecedented manner in order to encourage the soldiers to make head against the foe; and that the prisoners of war begged as a mercy to be permitted to enlist in the army that had captured them rather than return to misery by being exchanged.

Lastly. There is another source of weakness in the Russian Empire. That vast State is in a great measure composed of spoils which she has torn from surrounding nations. She is a patchwork of filched and unamalgamated materials. Her frontier provinces are filled with injured, discontented, hostile populations, whom, being unable to reconcile to her rule, she has endeavoured to enfeeble and to crush; and many of whom wait, with more or less of patience and desire, the blessed day of emancipation and revenge. … Since the great Roman Empire probably, no State ever enfolded so many bitter enmities within its embrace, or was girt with such a circle of domestic foes.

Now these three last sources of Russian weakness are perennial. They belong to her as a despotism as a centralised administration, as an Empire formed by conquest and unconsolidated and unsecured by conciliation. Until, therefore, her whole system changed; till an honest middle class has been created; till her Government be liberalised and de-centralised; till a free Press be permitted and encouraged to unveil and denounce abuses; and till the rights and feelings of annexed territories be habitually respected, we do not think that Russia need henceforth be considered as formidable for aggression. She has been unmasked; it will be the fault of Europe if it dreads her, or submits to be bullied by her, any longer.

Well, it turns out that you get what you pay for. And we're seeing that first hand. 

The T72 tank (and derivatives) are cheap because they sort of forget important things. Like crew survivability or electronic warfare equipment or high quality optics. The same can be said for the warships and aircraft. They save money on the frontend when the weapons are bought, and sometimes having the tanks can help the buyers bluff their shitty hand. But sometimes you have to show your hand... and Russia is in that predicament right now. Russia has been bluffing their hand so long, they believe their shitty hand reflects the bluff. 

As expensive as other weapons are, it has really come clear that they are worth their money in this conflict. 

Another great example is the TB2 compared to the Reapers and the Predators. The TB2 is a smaller and cheaper UAV compared to the Reapers and Predators. You'd think that this makes them better because you can buy ~2-4 TB2s for the cost of one predator. Why in the world would anybody want a predator??? Well, that's the kicker right there. The TB2 is cheaper for a reason. Let me explain.

The Predators have multiple weapon systems they can use that have all-weather capability. That means that the predator can drop bombs (JDAMs) through clouds. The TB2, as far as I can tell, is all line of sight. So if there is a cloudy day, it is basically out of action. Surprise surprise, Ukraine can be quite cloudy. If your enemy knows that, they can always make sure to be well hidden during clear days. 

Additionally, as far as I can tell, the TB2 has no deicing equipment. That means that any time there is visible moisture in the air and the ground temperature is about 45F or less, they can't operate (unless they want to risk losing the UAV). Which pretty much eliminates flying any winter day with clouds, which turns out to be pretty common in Ukraine. Predators have deicing equipment. So they can basically fly whenever they want. 

Those two things make a huge case for why the predator would be considered worth 2-4x more than a TB2. And we're seeing it play out. I'm 90% sure that the 40 mile Kyiv convoy was able to operate free of concern from the TB2 after the first 1-2 days, when the weather got crappy. For about 2 weeks. That gave the Russians breathing room to mount an offensive. Luckily, it seems like the Ukraine ground forces are what saved Kyiv. 

And we didn't even start to talk about ATGMs and Manpads...",2c316a6b3569b3fcf4649eb10213cb3cadd100fc,True,False,,,,,0,1649966285,,0,{},i4qrf6q,False,t3_u3fvip,False,True,t3_u3fvip,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3fvip/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_14_2022/i4qrf6q/,1649966302,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649937485.0,

You have to remember, a lot of us are ***spoiled***. Spoiled by years of small expeditionary armies, of 9 months of basic training for an infantryman, plus 7-12 months of high readiness training before a deployment. Where you need a course to run a chainsaw, or drive a van. Where we have legions of staff officers, doctrine, simulation, directing staff. Where it takes 10 years to make a section commander, 20 years of experience as a platoon warrant officer. Or the road to high readiness is measured in years. 

That's how our system works in the west. That's what 75 years has done. The idea of just giving out equipment, willy-nilly does not go well.

1. Nascent political institutions surviving an existential conflict. Even established democracies have a *ton* of difficulty maintaining civil institutions and civic norms through a war and in the aftermath. Look at the utter dysfunction that was French politics throughout the 1950s and 1960s (although to be fair, French politics is always a little messy). Ukraine has a strong civic society, but politically speaking it's been extremely tenuous since 2016 onward and now you can add a huge supply of advanced weaponry to the mix. This is liable to cause some serious instability. 
2. Huge dearth of human capital. How many Ukrainians have fled the country? Many will return, but some will not. Pre-war Ukraine was not a rich country and human capital is a key element in post-war reconstruction and stability. 
3. Continued Russian interference. Whether Ukraine pushes Russian troops to Feb 23 lines or further, or exists as a Western aligned rump state (unlikely) you can guarantee that the Russians will continue to interfere in Ukrainian political and economic life. 
4. Corruption. Ukraine still suffers from relatively high levels of corruption (thankfully not in the armed forces it appears), which is only going to further make reconstruction efforts difficult. Corruption also creates negative feedback loops into civil society wherein corrupt players amass political power via their corruption networks. Injecting large amounts of cash into this system is going to create knock-on effects with much destabilization. 
5. Continued political will in the EU and USA to fund Ukraine. This one I am less concerned about, but we are entering a period of inflation, soaring asset prices, continued supply chain disruption, and a rapidly dwindling chance of a post-Covid boom. It's easy to imagine a series of political crises that cause the USA and EU to turn inwards as a Ukraine rebuilding program will not be done in a few years but more likely a decade. 

I don't say these things to discourage a Ukrainian financial assistance program. I would just like us to all be aware that this is going to be a long-run affair with challenges and difficulties every step of the way. Ukraine is not post-war Western Europe. It is likely to continue to face civil difficulties, corruption, fractious politics, and interference from outside powers.

Instead, look at Putin as a desperate leader who is clinging onto power in a country that is corrupt, liberalizing, and becoming more and more unsettled with the government. He knows this and is using propaganda in order to maintain power.

Putin has essentially used this war as a way to bring an iron fist down on opposition and to rally the country around the flag. Additionally, he has effectively been able to blame ""the west"" for all the ills of Russian society. Because if the reason food is hard to get is because of sanctions, people won't blame the government. 

Don't forget, Russia has used propaganda really effectively for a long time. The goal of the propaganda is to protect the state and thus the leader of the state.

The Russian military of the 2020’s has many of the same deficiencies the Russian military of 1850’s had during the Crimean War. The Russian Empire of the mid-19th century was considered one of the great powers of Europe, with manpower reserves that dwarfed her opponents. Despite her overwhelming numbers, Russia greatly struggled in the Crimean War against the alliance of Britain, France, &amp; Turkey. 

The Russian army was revealed to have a vast difference between combat strength and paper strength of its forces, as officers &amp; recruiters exaggerated the numbers for personal/political gain. The large numbers of Russia troops were hamstrung by logistics, unable to effectively supply &amp; deploy the bulk of their forces at any given battle. Even on their own turf, Russian troops were ill-equipped &amp; poorly trained to fight. The Russian army was largely made of conscripts, demoralized and forced to serve under the autocratic Tsar. 

In a nutshell: the Russians are facing now are similar to the issues Russia faced in the Crimean War, primarily due to political brown-nosing &amp; lack of a professional officer/NCO corps to maintain discipline &amp; keep logistics moving.

Additionally, Market Garden occurred well within the ""The war will be over by Xmas"" timeframe, where the Allies believed that if they got over the Rhine the Germans defenses would collapse and the govt would surrender, with neither SHAEF, 21st Army Group, 12th Army Group, or 6th Army Group knowing yet that the Germans had just pulled off the ""Miracle in the West"" and managed to reconstitute their forces without the Allies knowing it.",529ee7fc36cc0bbc153860d76d58fb70d05a1c6b,True,False,,,,,0,1649953252,,0,{},i4pudn6,False,t3_u1em2j,False,True,t1_i4j5zka,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1em2j/leadership_lessons_from_the_past_operation_market/i4pudn6/,1649953267,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649924452.0,

As it stands, the invasion will set the Russian economy back at least 24 months, but likely closer to a decade.  These costs are in addition to the lives lost, and billions, perhaps trillions of dollars in lost hardware and expended ordinance.  

(1)  Russia has secured more of Eastern Ukraine, where the population is statistically more pro-Russian than elsewhere in Ukraine.  

(2)  Russia is closer to cutting of Ukraine from the Black Sea.  This is important because Ukraine had contracts with a Western consortium (led by Shell) to develop large natural gas fields in the Black Sea that would provide natural gas to Ukraine and Europe.  Putin sees alternative pipelines to Europe as an almost existential crisis since so much of their economy is based on exporting oil and gas and without that hard currency, the Russian kleptocracy will struggle to survive.  

The development was paused when the Russians took Crimea, but the gas was still in Ukraine's EEZ prior to the most recent invasion.  The oil companies know risk when they see it and they didn't want to spend tens of billions developing the field only to have Russia come in and say ""this is ours now.""

EPISODE SUMMARY
Dmitri Alperovitch (@DAlperovitch) talks about nuclear nonproliferation with Jeffrey Lewis (@ArmsControlWonk), Director of East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey.
Topics discussed include:
- What is the latest status of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations?
- What are the key objections to JCPOA?
- What does Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei truly want?
- Why has Iran already beaten all world records at the longest time to acquiring a nuclear bomb?
- How significant is the benefit of a nuclear weapons program to countries like Iran and North Korea?
- Did we forever miss the opportunity to contain nuclear proliferation in the 70s-90s with a lax enforcement regime?
- 16 years after North Korea first tested a nuclear device, is it time to acknowledge that North Korea is not going to give up its weapons and refocus our diplomatic strategy with them on more achievable objectives?
- And much more...",88d51e663ce67b17caccc399ccf94f039440a92c,True,False,,,,,0,1649943005,,0,{},i4p54jq,True,t3_u3hjb2,False,True,t3_u3hjb2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u3hjb2/nuclear_weapons_iran_north_korea_and_have_we_lost/i4p54jq/,1649943019,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649914205.0,

Ok, I get it, you're austrian, and you're coping that you're not in NATO, but lets look at this rationally.  


Much more economic potential:  
The EU not only has less natural resources than the US, it's also poorer in nominal and PPP terms, despite a larger population and a several hundred year head start, so uh, ok. Not a great start.

Much better education: dude, according to the Shanghai ranking (which I'm not actually too fond of, but it's not european based and it's not US based), the best university in your country is somewhere between 150 to 200 in the world. The best university in the US is the best university in the world. Out of the top 50 in the world, the US has 28 of the spots, including 16 of the top 20 (the EU has... 1 out of the top 20). This further translates into economic power and potential.   


Third: neither europe nor the EU is a great power. Its a collection of middle powers with two great powers in an alliance, but there's no coherent foreign policy, no coherent domestic policy. Nations can leave whenever they want. Hungary and Poland exist and aren't exact liberal bastions...

Look, I'm an EU/US citizen. I agree that it would be great for europe to become more united and actually turn into a great/super power. I would love to see a united EU and US form a ""super EU"" or whatever (along with a bunch of other countries). But what you're saying is noncredible on the face of it.

With the loss of the Moskva it looks like there are 4 Frigates, maybe 6 or 7 small guided missile boats, plus the subs and auxiliary vessels in the black sea.

Turkey closed the bosphorus to any Russian ships not of the black sea fleet.

Looks like there is approximately 1400km of coastline Ukraine has on the black sea.

My understanding of modern naval warfare is that missile defense is a numbers game. I assume that Moskva out of the picture will mean the Russian navy will need to group their ships closer together to provide more effective missile shields, which will open larger amounts of coastline for pro Ukrainian shipping, and coastal maneuver. 

Assume Russia will also be moving their ships  further offshore to mitigate Ukrainian drones.

None of this seems hugely consequential. I think the real win here is less that Moskva is no longer active and more that: Ukrainian Neptune batteries are active and potent, and the strongest of Russian vessels are vulnerable.

The mutual defense agreements of the EU are a dead letter.  It's basically ""send at least one helmet and some coffee to us if we get attacked"" - the EU is an economic union and has no realistic military power to compare with Russia's.  

It's why Russia basically started an invasion over the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO (which wasn't even going to happen, ironically), whereas they've publicly said several times they barely care about Ukraine joining the EU.

Again, you know this, and that's exactly why you want Europe to leave NATO - you're trying to erode Europe's defense capabilities by convincing people that the EU is somehow enough.  Weird forum to do it, since most people in here know damn well that EU mutual defense is **nothing**.

\-Yes the missile has to be bigger. But the plane is the other half of the missile in the case of the aircraft. Which is cheaper? A bigger rocket with a booster? Or a pilot and his training logistics, plus the air base, plus the plane. There is no comparison. The missile is the more efficient system. 

\-Reaction time does matter. But your assuming that the aircraft is on station where it is needed, and that we are necessarily using a long range missile that is far from the front. I proposed such long range missiles, but I also proposed shorter ranged ones. These would be echeloned in depth and provide different capabilities. A hellifire from a truck 8km away on a truck is going to get there just as fast as a hellfire from a chopper or a plane that is in range. 

\-I am taking it into account. Planes have all the same problems. If a EA device disrupt a missile fired from the ground, it can do it to a plane. If the planes are using unguided munitions, than they are not going to be of much use anyway and its absurdly unlikely they will be able operate close enough to the front line a the ranges required for dumb bombs or guns. Also how is EA going to stop a laser guided truck launched missile via any means that would not work on the plane?

They haven't received the training. They do not have the course, or the qualifications to use said equipment.  There are courses and training required to use any piece of military equipment, from a chainsaw, to a nuclear weapon. 

Just because you're a trained mechanic means nothing until you attend the proper course of military training to learn to be a mechanic. Or if a lumberjack, that you are remotely qualified to use a military issue chainsaw. 

Until those courses are completed, until training, certification has been completed, how can anyone trust them to use that equipment effectively.  Otherwise you're admitting that there is no need for training at all.

**Just because it's a war, does not mean that standards can be lost.  Or that people can just do what they want, there are rules.**  Standard operating procedures, tactics, techniques and procedures, doctrine, regulations, instructions. You cannot simply abandon that due to extenuating circumstances. A war does not mean throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Intro to the report:

&gt; Welcome to the fifth edition of Space Threat Assessment by the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Over the past five years, this assessment has used open-source information to track the developments of counterspace weapons that threaten U.S. national security interests in space. The United States has relied heavily on its space infrastructure since the first satellites were launched to track and monitor nuclear missile launches during the Cold War. Over the past six decades, the United States has grown more reliant on the information, situational awareness, and connectivity provided by military, civil, and commercial space systems. It should be no surprise that these assets are a target for adversaries attempting to gain asymmetric military advantage. The Space Threat Assessment is critical to understanding the changing nature of the space domain and monitoring trends in space and counterspace weapons.

&gt; This year’s assessment covers the growing space and counterspace capabilities of China, Russia, India, Iran, North Korea, and other nations. For more detail on past counterspace weapons tests, including historical tests by the United States and the Soviet Union, please review the prior Space Threat Assessments (editions 2018–2021) or visit the Aerospace Secu­rity Project’s interactive online timeline at https://aerospace.csis.org/counterspace-timeline/.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"The answer to both questions is the same: Kill them before they kill us. The old Soviet navy had a defensive orientation and a mission to protect the coast, for reasons illustrated in the above post. They wanted to do it with a three layered system. First SSGNs could attack CVBGs from afar. IIRC the Oscars carried the same carrier-killer missile as the surface combatants, or at least something similar. They would push the battle into the Atlantic and try to bag something valuable out there. Books like Red Storm Rising suggest that these were primarily anti-convoy ships, reflecting a general western misunderstanding regarding Soviet doctrine and war planning. But, as mentioned above, if you step back I think youll agree that subs like the Oscar carry too few and too large missiles for attacking many small convoy ships. Theyre carrier killers first, and really popping transports while the CVBGs roam is a waste of a missile. Ditto for Soviet supercavitating torpedo experiments. Russian attack subs would be great for this, *but* they were typically used either for anti-sub patrols OR to protect the Arctic SSBN bastion, and so again would not in wartime wage an anti-shipping war like many Americans feared. 

Second you have the Backfires and land based bombers, and here you have a great example in of their use in the same *Red Storm Rising*. Thats pretty self explanatory, these platforms are *excellent* for a high volume attack aimed at punching through American AD. Assuming of course that they could find the CVBG AND that the CV was where it was supposed to be in the CVBG, both things which turned out to be harder for the Soviets than it seemed in the 1980s. 

Last you have the surface fleet, which would have worked the eastern edge of the Norwegian sea around Murmansk to keep American ships away from the coast. Under the cover of Soviet air and AD, the design of a ship like the Moskva makes sense. Its the command ship for a surface battle group, and it would have pulled double duty coordinating the sub hunt and, if it got the chance, pounding US carriers who were brave (or stupid) enough to try and press the Soviet coast. 

The fact that they only built three of the Slava should tell you it wasn't intended to be a war winning design. It was a command ship of sorts, something that could either work with a battlecruiser in an anti-surface role OR with some destroyers and frigates hunting subs. The goal isn't to compete in some grand sense. The Russian navy was never big enough or strong enough to directly compete with the USN, and anyway it wasted too much in prestige projects such as the Kuznetsov class (abortive) of CVs. The USSR put so much faith in the ability of its airwing that it included ASM launchers. On a carrier. Anyway this was not a navy designed to compete in a military sense, but in a prestige sense. Moreover it was part of an A2/AD strategy designed to secure a rear area along the Russian coast, deny deep penetration air raids from sea, and ensure that the SSBN fleet remained totally protected in incase it was needed. The goal wasn't to choke off the Atlantic so much as turn the North and Norwegian seas into a no-mans-land(sea).",55b83e8cb417dc96594cbd673bd7f7027c990198,True,False,,,,,0,1649909131,,0,{},i4nroyb,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4nexu2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4nroyb/,1649909145,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649880331.0,

The Russians do seem to have failed to employ combined arms warfare in most places. The glimpses that we do see are from areas that Russia has failed the most at being a professional military. Were there successful attempts to act like a real military that we don't know about, where they succeeded in defeating the Ukrainians in pitched battles? Perhaps. But the amount of areas where they did fail to be a professional military are numerous, so it does not give me hope for those areas we know nothing about. 

There has certainly been a lot of guerilla tactics by the Ukrainians. Ambushes, and hit and run tactics have been seen on a lot of combat footage. But there are also many areas where the Ukrainians have held territory in spite of repeated Russian attacks. There is a lot of trench warfare in the East of Ukraine, from Donbas to Kharkiv, going on for example. And holding territory despite heavy assault is the opposite of guerilla warfare. The East is where I have read that Ukraine has the bulk of its professional military, so it makes sense that these professionals would be best able to go toe to toe with the Russians.

My guess is that your assessment is more correct than not. If a little more correct on the Russian side than the Ukrainian.

There could be a return, or an attempted return, by both sides to a more conventional combined arms warfare. Both sides could have trouble with doing so for no other reason than they have been exhausted and attrited by weeks of high intensity conflict. A type of conflict that has seen many casualties on the most experienced soldiers of both armies. And performing combined arms warfare is difficult for even the most experienced armies. 

The vastness of Ukraine also comes into play here. The density of focusing on the East of Ukraine will allow both sides to concentrate their forces into a better and more unified command. The stretched out foolishness of the Russians in the North allowed, encouraged, and even demanded, the guerilla tactics by Ukrainians. As the Russians change the location and scale of the fight it will dictate a change in Ukrainian tactics to counter them.

I have been waiting for Russia to get out of its funk for a while now, thinking that they will snap out of the nonsense they have been trying and getting back to their doctrine. But so far they have not been able to show that they know their core competencies, let alone be able to put it all together into symphony of combined arms warfare that is their doctrine. 

So I do expect both sides to have trouble with combined arms warfare. But this is much harder on the offense  of course and a Ukrainian defense in trenches could be able to blunt Russian attacks by just performing well at that task alone. Good trenches combined with modern ATGMs are a powerful defensive position to be in. So the task of combined arms warfare is more critical for the Russians to achieve in my opinion.

I don't think that the impact of the struggle for combined arms warfare is exactly the same for the Russians as it was at the start of the war. Because if you look at the start of the war they did not even seem to try to perform any form of professional military doctrine. A race to Kyiv with riot police right after lightly armed special forces is not part of any combined arms doctrine, it is the opposite of that in fact.

If the Russian military fails to be able to return to their doctrine of acting like a competent, professional military able to perform combined arms warfare then this will have a much greater impact on the war. That would demonstrate that it is not just foolish political ideas of war that have gotten them in in trouble, but instead that their entire military is rotten and cannot be fixed without a chainsaw's amount of reforms. 

These opinions are under the supposition that the Russians still want to take territory and that the Ukrainians will be on the defensive. But this could change at some point in the future.",71603fde8272304b807cd0eff53c3ffbe4399c3e,True,False,,,,,0,1649908291,,0,{},i4nq5fs,False,t3_u18fq1,False,True,t1_i4jww6e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u18fq1/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_11th/i4nq5fs/,1649908306,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649879491.0,

Borders are human constructions, they aren't based in any objective reality. So, in a sense, a popularity contest is the only meaningful way to define them (well, that and force).

This may be based solely on personal experience, but I recall a *lot* of what I can only describe as war hysteria in the lead up and during the early days of the Iraq War. I think as the occupation dragged on and it was clear that the political objectives weren't going to be reached (this was long after victory was declared) that the real souring began. I don't think a bungled campaign involving American casualties skyrocketing would have led Americans to say ""stop"" the war (at least not those who already weren't against it). 

Anyway this is alternate history so we'll never be sure who is right and who is wrong (and I'm more than willing to admit I could be wrong here), but my point is simply that as casualties build a lot of Russian opinion fits into the box of ""our boys are dying, let's not have them die for nothing."" There's a distinct element of Russian society that views Putin as *soft* on foreign policy and that his reluctance to do things like bomb central Kyiv is weakness. As casualties mount to the point they can't be hidden from the general public anymore, we may actually see this element win over. 

I'll also add that much of Russian military recruitment comes from areas outside of Moscow / Petersburg where the majority of political power is held. It's in the far less developed rural areas (ironically where Putin enjoys his most support) that recruitment is the highest.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Its important to see the naval buildup in context. It didn't really get going until the 1970s and two big things happened there.

First the USSR's economy transformed. You'll recall that starting in 1973 and lasting through that decade, Oil prices skyrocketed and, mostly, stayed up. This was thanks to OPEC and the Arab states accepting that oil could be wielded as a weapon against the US and Europe. Who benefited most? Russia with its large oil reserves. They very quickly capitalized on this and made significant amounts selling oil around the world which went into the state treasury, because its not like their version of Exxon was going to hoard the profits. The USSR could have spent the money on domestic economic improvements like infrastructure, education, space, whatever. Instead they bought weapons. This is how they paid for the big ground forces buildup, and this is how they paid for the big naval buildup. That and cutting a lot of Khrushchev's 1960s era domestic spending projects. 

Second, the USSR realized that the birth of the American Supercarrier posed a major risk for them defensively. Think about what happened to Vietnam in the 1960s, for damn near ten years a CVBG parked itself off their coast and pounded the country into dust. Imagine what the USN could do, with nukes, against the USSR? So the USSR decided to do something about it. Nobody ever asks 'why is every damn ship in the Russian fleet designed to kill a CV.' Because the question *seems* obvious. But step back a second, if you think Russia planned to wage an offensive war against NATO lines of communication in the Atlantic, why ever waste your time trying to kill carriers? Japan had this same problem in WWII, they designed excellent submarines then wasted them trying to sink battleships and CVs. The USSR was smarter, in a sense. It designed its ships and SSGNs to kill American CVs because using them to kill convoys was, at best, a secondary goal. The primary goal was to keep American airpower far, far, far away from either the Russian coast and its vulnerable cities and ports, as well as away from the 'SSBN bastion' they maintained above the Arctic Circle to ensure second strike capabilities. And what kind of ships did they build? Ships with great sonars, like the Horsejaw, and ships which were *littered* with CV killing ASMs. Youll notice the Harpoon is much more versatile, but also much smaller and probably wouldn't kill a CV in one or even several hits. But two of these Neptune missiles that Ukraine (allegedly) hit the Moskva with are basically Harpoon clones. And keep in mind, a single F/A-18 carries, IIRC, up to four of those badboys. 

Everything else, the commerce raiding and the peacetime port calling. All of it was a nice bump in the Navy's prestige and a great way to visibly challenge the US in a new domain. But it was secondary to the primary threat, which was the US's perceived, and after the New Maritime Strategy demonstrated, capability to put CVs off the Soviet coast and attack vital infrastructure.",5f19954bddea9e47b99fcff7e27c5357bede08ca,True,False,,,,,0,1649902014,,0,{},i4ndgko,False,t3_u2oojz,False,False,t1_i4n1vqm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4ndgko/,1649902029,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649873214.0,

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Well it seems similar enough, but I think its really two separate cases. In the case of the T-72, (as with most of the newer T-series) the autoloader really makes that the case. Plus the overall short height and small dimensions force the ammo load down into the hull, where a single penetration can blow the stores into the crew compartment (very bad, I hear). Versus western tanks, which are designed to keep ammo separate in a turret compartment designed to blow out, rather than in. 

In the case of the Moskva its hard to say anything at this point. The two things I keep hearing are 'fire' and 'ammo detonation.' This is a problem with warships generally dating back to the Battle of Jutland. The solution, typically, is to keep ammo in a safe and armored place, separated from the rest of the ship by blast doors. Unless the armored area is breached, and tbh I dont think these kind of missiles can do that like an old battleship shell could, your ammo load is safe from direct destruction. If proper safety measures are taken like keeping the magazine shut off, keeping it clean and well maintained, and wetting it if a fire looks to threaten it, you can seriously minimize the changes of a detonation. For some reason this didn't happen on the Moskva. Maybe her magazine was penetrated, maybe the fire started *in* the magazine (tbh I havn't seen confirmation that the causality was caused by a UA strike, though I personally lean in that direction. As of writing this, I have to acknowledge tho that this could be a tragic mishap all to common on RU warships), or maybe the fire started somewhere else and spread into the fire thanks to extremely poor damage control and maintenance procedures.

In the one case the reputation is earned thanks to design choices which necessitated a tradeoff re: crew safety. In the other, it seems like 'best practices' werent followed sufficiently to prevent a casualty from turning into a catastrophe OR the UA managed to land a big blow which made saving the ship otherwise impossible.

One thing I'm unclear on is timing, which happened first the magazine detonation or the call to abandon ship? If the magazine detonation happened first, it was the result of damage control failures of the first order. If the ship was abandoned, it may signal that the captain and crew had already decided she was unsalvageable and left the fire to rage out of control.",8cca1ef301d6eaa17a540f8d7e4f890c493a82d7,True,False,,,,,0,1649900138,,0,{},i4n971u,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4mxg4d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4n971u/,1649900150,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649871338.0,
