Errr...Error....

Military capability extends well beyond a soldier. If you are the greatest football player in the world, and you have a shitty team owner and coach, you might not be winning the championships. 

Now idk if you're trying to tilt this as if I made some slight against individual soldiers? Because I'm a realist, and I'm aware of reality. American Soldiers at least residually are some of the best, we recruit a weighted amount of people who are particularly interested in military related things. We have some great marksman due to our gun/hunting culture. Our revolutionary War mentality, patriotism and the general belief that we are bringing goodness to the world fighting Nazi Zombies makes our troops some of the most dedicated. 

We contrast in battles where other armies will run, we will fight to the last man comparatively. Deidcation, skill, money etc, are some of the best. 

In a world where corruption reigns Supreme we have massive logistical and fraud, waste and abuse issues. However, those are mostly less bad than the rest of the world. Or at the least, we throw enough money at it, to exceed past others. (If we waste 20% of $100, so does everyone else, but then we just throw $75 more at it, and then waste $56 of that). 

But that isn't intrinsically what wins wars. No one is scared the taliban or Vietnamese folks are going to conquer America tomorrow lol. 

We steam roll in wars for a moment, due to our general superiority in tech, training, and particularly air power. 

But that's great for battles. We don't win WARS. And wars have nothing to do with soldiers, battles do. Wars are won by the team owners and the coaches, and ours are just as shitty as any other, or worse. 

It's like when people say ""The Russian government sucks, but not the Russian People"" type things right? Well, no matter what the small percentage of hardcore American patriots might do or be able to do, their owners, their rulers, don't operate the same way. 

In the end, this means, we lose wars, even if we win every battle, we lose the war. 

And again, soldiers win battles, owners win wars. 

I mean who is the head coach if the US team right now? We've literally got a wandering dementia patient roaming the streets. 

You can be Steve Rogers and it doesn't fucking matter how many times you punch Hitler in the face, you're going home eventually to find out we lost the war. It is, what it is. 

Nothing in my post claimed Russia had a better military, or that they would flay the US, or any such nonsense. Putin himself has even said that Russia cannot defeat NATO let alone the US in the straight up sense of war. 

Actually that's a mark of distinction between the crazy levels of world leaders. NK, Iran etc they'll talk mad shit like they can mount some invasion if they had to, and it's a fucking joke. 

The only two ""evil crazy"" world leaders I've seen speak logic and reality in that sense was Assad a while back when asked what he would do to America he said ""Hope they don't attack because we can't do shit to them"". And Putin who has said ""I can't fight NATO, except for nukes"". Which is just facts. 

But if our typical leadership of war fighting were to be at play when we go into a Russia, we will have many many Americans die, and in the end, for nothing. Like Veitnam, like Afghanistan etc. 

So maybe you as your appeal to your soldier status, want to die for no reason? But it's a betrayl of everything we as Americans are supposed to be and stand for. To send our people as Canon fodder to die fighting with gusto just to be set aside for no real purpose. 

That's a fucking corrupt as tragedy. And if you believe in that, you're not an American Soldier. You're a politician. You should be angry, ashamed, saddend by the complete failure of the ruling elite of the US and the tragic deaths of those who fought honorably with the belief that their battles would win a war that no one really cared about winning above them. 

Only a politican would defend that. Or maybe someone beyond delusional who doesn't emotionally want to face reality. And I get it man... I wanna be 15 again, I wanna think that America is running around beating up Nazi Zombie Terrorists while riding an eagle and bringing tidings of comfort and joy to the oppressed and needy.... 

I want to. But I'm not able to sooth that which sucks, with lies.

&gt; Moskva, the flagship of Russia&amp;#039;s Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when &amp;quot;Stormy seas&amp;quot; caused it to sink, according to a ministry message.

&gt; Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew.

&gt; On the first day of Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender - to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal.

Ukraine armed forces claim it was struck by 2 anti-ship Neptune missiles, but Russia claims there was an accident that caused a fire and an ammunition explosion. I personally believe that the Ukraine story is more likely but I also wanted to verify it was physcially possible before believing it.   
   
Russia news media confirming the sinking on twitter - Note its in Russian you'll have to right click and then choose ""Translate to English"" (at that's how it works in Chrome)  
https://twitter.com/rianru/status/1514693645185818630?s=21&amp;t=SlMFSnY\_BOFkqWVu4T3wTg  
The Ukraine claim is they sacrificed a TB2 Bayraktar attack drone to distract the ships defenses and then hit the ship with the 2 Ukrainian designed and built Neptune anti-ship missiles fired from shore.   
Neptune Anti-Ship Missile has a listed range between 175 and 190 miles. (varies due to source) and is a land-based system.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360\_Neptune  
Sevastopol (the port for Russia's Black Sea Fleet) where Moskva left from a few days ago is approximetely 164 miles from Dmytrivka (the nearest point of safely Ukraine controlled terriroty to Sevastopol. (I'm not saying the Neptunes were in Dmytrivka - just showing that Moskva is known to be in an area that is within the range of the Neptune system. If Moskva had sailed North, Northwest or West it would have been in range of multiple locations along the coast including Odesa.  
The claim that Ukraine distracted the ship with a TB2 Bayraktar attack drone also verifies as possible.  
Flight Range is 3600 miles, communication control range is 190 miles.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar\_Bayraktar\_TB2  
  
At the very least - we can say the Ukraine claim is possible. Unless Ukraine or Russia releases evidence to support or refut the claims its probably impossible to prove one is true over the other.   
  
Note: This is supposedly one of the ships that was told to ""Warship F\* off"" during the opening days of the war by Ukraine defenders on Snake Island. As this has become an almost ""Remember the Alamo"" type inspiring war cry for Ukraine - the sinking of one of the ships involved (regardless of reason) and sinking the flagship of the Russian navy is a morale boost of significant portions.",60fd4a330643efb6746a0416dc81d1d47508d3f8,True,False,,,,,0,1649975816,,0,{},i4redmw,True,t3_u3tbb7,False,True,t3_u3tbb7,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u3tbb7/are_ukraine_claims_of_sinking_the_russian/i4redmw/,1649975833,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649947016.0,,,,

I'm going to address the last line first: we should remember this when we claim a moral high ground.... 

Secondly, as to the modern army thing.... we have only fought ""pathetic"" armies for most of the last century and we haven't won.... 

So, While the Russian army is clearly a little bit disappointing, propaganda is real. See, we are mostly only covering their losses and any potential collateral damage. On the other hand, we here cover our successes and our enemies collateral damages. 

But the results have been that we might have kind of won in Iraq? Around now-ish after almost 10 years. 

We lost Afghanistan, we lost Vietnam, we tied in Korea.

Oh, we won in Grendada. Heart Break Ridge, good movie. Basically other than Grendada if you remove propaganda we statistically suck. 

So I'm not even sure this is a ""Russia"" thing, it seems everyone sucks anymore. But do you really think we're just going to go into Russia and ""win""? Other than them just not feeling like fighting, we don't know about winning. We aren't Charlie Sheen lol. 

Russia isn't going to win either against us. 

So really, no body wins. We could just agree to never let Ukraine into NATO, and basically the war ends. Then everybody wins, except various politicians stock market plans.... so we ain't going to do that now are we?",cb3c01232ab1af3c684a8bab77bfc7915c48a15a,True,False,,,,,0,1649974284,,0,{},i4rauj8,False,t3_u1vid9,False,False,t1_i4f7d3k,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u1vid9/russia_is_no_longer_able_to_construct_modern/i4rauj8/,1649974296,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649945484.0,,,,

U.S. AND Russia are both idiots when it comes to starting a war and even by your stupid comment you can see that your thoughts are not well educated.

You say the euromaidan was payed by America but the truth is that this even started earlier in the Orange Revolution. The biggest problem of Ukraine was not if it wanted to be part of the west or east but it’s own corruption. People were fed up with the politicians and this resulted in 2014 in the eurdomaidan… and even if it was payed by the us (you said you give proof here which you didn’t) this doesn’t allowed Russia to Anex the Crimea 1 month later... In the budapester Memorandum from 1991 Russia said that Ukraine is a sovereign state. 
And btw only 49% wanted to join eu,  31% didn’t want to join (mainly Donbas) and the rest was neutral. Even less wanted to join EU later. So where do you take your information about the western payed propaganda… because it obviously didn’t work. Quote :“However, in a December poll by the same company, only 30% wanted to join eu“.
In general… Ukraine was just fed up with its corrupt government, nothing more and they have a right to protest against their government if it fucks up. What russia did on the other hand was not ok. Like I said for example anex the crime…
Wiki quotes:

between 45% and 50% of Ukrainians supported Euromaidan, while between 42% and 50% opposed it.

Even further you talk about neonazi sentiment which is way in contrast of the political situation. The far right political party got only some seats in the parliament in 2019 which is the weakest election for them for years.

The implication is that the Russians used their typical tactics to make sure that their supporters are on their side.

Let me explain how Chinese construction companies work in Namibia to get contracts.  Let's say that you're a black Namibian, I'm a white Namibian and Bob is a Chinese man.  We all own or represent construction companies.  Now, you - if you're the right flavor of black - will get the construction contracts.  Bob will get more constructions contracts.  And I'll be struggling to stay in business.  Both you and I employ the same black and white ratio of employees.  It's just that you're more favored because well, you're not white.  You're black Namibian, so by default, you will get favor.  But Bob, Bob the Chinese guy will outshine us all.  How?  Well, Bob will agree to all of the government contract demands.  He'll say that he'll employ local poor Namibians who need jobs, etc, etc…  But he'll also cozy up to enough decision makers and say, ""in the time that we've been working together, I've come to really appreciate your town and your family.  What can I do to help?  Do you need a new school?  Hospital?  Roads?  Let me know.  It's our gift to the city.  And your family, they are like my family.  I'd like to see that your children are well educated, and would like to sponsor a paid scholarship for your little grunt to Oxford.  

Guess what.  They get the contract.  

But what happens then?  Well, the buildings might be built, but really shoddily.  And local Namibians?  They don't get jobs.  At all.  But who does the work?  Well these construction company owners contact Chinese jails and pay the guards to get low level prisoners with this set of rules.  You'll work for 5 years, we'll pay you a stipend and after 5 years, your record is cleared and you'll have money in the bank to start you on resuming your life..  You'll build your own quarters, you'll build the building that we are constructing and if you DO ANYTHING to violate the contract, you'll go back to jail for twice as long.  

So, when the Chinese companies come in and start constructing, they use no local labor.  If anyone complains, the Chinese approach the people who they are offering to build roads/schools/hospitals and offer scholarships to and state that they will have to cancel their offer because of all the pressure they are getting to obey the laws they said they would.  When you have enough decision makers who will lose their kids' scholarships to Oxford, you can guess what happens.  The Chinese firms get exceptions.   It's even known that the former first president of the country's home loan is underwritten by Chinese companies.  And Chinese companies log out rosewood forests, fish out the waters and take over the construction companies.  Because of the art of the payoff.

I've sat at Joe's in Windhoek buying beer for a bitter racist white guy who owned a construction company and let him unload how they operate on me *and* one of my former friends was/is a major real estate/hotel developer in Windhoek, so I asked him ""is this true?""  And he replied with any details that I missed.

Even if the payoff isn't direct capital, it can be in favors, access, approval, and so on and so on.  And it is.  Russia will go in and make people feel important through the Useful Idiot approach.  Make them feel important, listened to important and valued.  Invite them to speak at conferences when they are the most important and featured speaker.  Make them rise in social importance.  And give them gifts and money if needed to keep them on your side.  It's a typical KGB tactic to get your way.",5bf85c8dc6c62568f4fa16a5cd8c8baa1c2c2657,True,False,,,,,0,1649897372,,0,{},i4n2w05,False,t3_u2qwlj,False,True,t1_i4mmcji,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u2qwlj/vladimir_putin_has_made_a_major_strategic_blunder/i4n2w05/,1649897390,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649868572.0,,,,
