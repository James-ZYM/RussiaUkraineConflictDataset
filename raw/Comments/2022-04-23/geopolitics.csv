Which doesn't have to be, if he reins his ego to decide for bidding more time. People forget that if such denouncement occurs, it would not the first time Beijing formally part ways with the Kremlin.

By bidding his time, repairing his relationship with the EU, and letting the autocratic African countries he nurtured consolidate more power, Xi would've be on a better position to strike their offensive with the US later.

These missions also show that the technology is now there for space to actually be economically profitable and strategically important. The new space race will not be about scienctific prestige, but really economic and military advantage.

Due the potential economic advantage of space and the cheaper technology making military control more feasible, private companies as we are seeing can drive real progress. Therefore the action in space will be far more substantial and meaningful (not just prestige) and will not be kept 'neutral'

In abstract, almost no one would object to saving 1B people v 1 cat for example.

No, if you go back and read the guy's responses to me, he was simply calling Mearsheimer, Jervis, and the others ""sociopaths"", and positing that you can't just let one country do evil to another country even in the name of avoiding a nuclear-armed confrontation. 

&gt;In abstract, most of what you have mentioned has some moral arguments in its favour. Its practical implementations in many cases, less so.

The problem is starting from a short-sighted moral argument and bull-headedly following through with it even though its outcome is most likely to be disastrous. For example, the principle of sovereignty - ""Ukraine is sovereign, therefor Russia has no rights there and Ukraine has the right to join NATO."" This is a principled stance, but an impractical one. Ukraine was never going to join NATO because everyone knew that the second it made a move to do so, Russia would invade it. It was also, by 2014, in a civil war that had heavy Russian involvement. So what Russia asked for was a signed guarantee from the West that Ukraine would not be permitted into NATO. What did the West do? They floated the false hope of NATO membership for Ukraine so that the Ukrainians kept pursuing it, thinking they would be protected by NATO. Why? In part because they believed in the *principle* of giving Ukraine *the option* to choose to join NATO as a sovereign nation. Now Ukraine is being wrecked, Russia is a truly renegade state, and every day that the war goes on, there is a chance for a military exchange between NATO and Russia on the western Ukrainian border.

&gt;Seeing administrators/politicians talk, I feel like this idea is used to justify morally questionable actions when in reality, the justifications don't hold up to appropriate scrutiny.

Yes, a well informed person can tell the difference between politicians bullshitting, or politicians acting in the greater interest, and compromising their moral image in doing so. But that goes the other way too - administrators/politicians also talk morally to justify harmful and short-sighted policies.

&gt;Would you agree that there is a place for escalatory policies?

Depends entirely on the context. I think at this point, the goal is to de-escalate things, and in fact things could have been de-escalated before the invasion by offering Russia an ""off-ramp"", but that was shot down to maintain Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian demands. Continued escalation driven by outrage over the war is itself sociopathic, because its attempting to draw the entire world into the conflict with sanctions regimes and economic ruination.

&gt;Why do you view this ""remake"" as a bad thing? A remake done right only favours the populations of these countries. The current setup only seems to favour and protect the interests of few at the cost of the larger population.

They only sought to remake them because they thought that was the best way to control them, not for the good of the people. No nation is going to lay down and let you colonize it and transform its society without fighting back. The ""current setup"" in those nations is a state of chaos and war, much worse than the previous regimes. And at the end of the day, its up to the ""larger population"" to fight for their own rights, dignity and destiny, not for a foreign country to guide them to it on its own terms.",7e1194f6f68d724c018efe24c1849b042a03ac17,True,False,,,,,0,1650705467,,0,{},i5uxd4z,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i5uv1zn,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i5uxd4z/,1650705478,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650676667.0

As a noob, I am inclined to agree with the initial statement that some countries shouldn't be allowed to maintain their spheres of influence.

Machiavelli (*The Prince*), Morgenthau (*The Evil of Politics and the Ethics of Evil*), Weber (*Politics as a Vocation*) and Michael Walzer (*The Problem of Dirty Hands*) can answer this one for you. 

Weber and Walzer best address the difference between personal and political morality: it's the difference between conviction and responsibility:

&gt;""The men who act for us and in our name are often killers, or
seem to become killers too quickly and too easily.
Knowing all this or most of it, good and decent people still enter
political life, aiming at some specific reform or seeking a general reformation. They are then required to learn the lesson Machiavelli first
set out to teach: ""how not to be good.""7 Some of them are incapable of
learning; many more profess to be incapable. But they will not succeed
unless they learn, for they have joined the terrible competition for
power and glory; they have chosen to work and struggle as Machiavelli
says, among ""so many who are not good."" They can do no good themselves unless they win the struggle, which they are unlikely to do
unless they are willing and able to use the necessary means. So we
are suspicious even of the best of winners. It is not a sign of our perversity if we think them only more clever than the rest. They have
not won, after all, because they were good, or not only because of that,
but also because they were not good. No one succeeds in politics without getting his hands dirty.""

- Walzer


&gt;Why is ""pearl clutching"" a bad thing here?

I'll let Morgenthau answer that one:

&gt;""By avoiding a political action because it is 
unjust, the perfectionist does nothing 
but exchange blindly one injustice for 
another which might even be worse 
than the former. He shrinks from the lesser evil because he does not want to do 
evil at all. Yet his personal abstention 
from evil, which is actually a subtle form 
of egotism with a good conscience, does 
not at all affect the existence of evil in the 
world but only destroys the faculty of 
discriminating between different evils. 
The perfectionist thus becomes finally a 
source of greater evil.""

This goes back to the blinkered support for escalation policies by well-meaning moralists. Just a month ago even some U.S officials were taking the insane stance: ""STOP THE WAR NOW! NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE!"" During Hillary Clinton's campaign, she promised a no-fly zone over Syria to save civilian lives from Russian airstrikes. I can tell from your questions that you are smart enough to know why that would have possible led to worse outcomes than either war.

&gt; How does understanding the ""big bad world"" absolve it?

It does not absolve it. It's a matter of recognize politics for what it is in order to understand what should be done. As Morgenthau puts it:

&gt;""[Man's] personal abstention 
from evil, which is actually a subtle form 
of egotism with a good conscience, does 
not at all affect the existence of evil in the 
world but only destroys the faculty of 
discriminating between different evils.""

And

&gt;. Whenever we act with reference to our fellow men, we must sin and we must still sin 
when we refuse to act; for the refusal to 
be involved in the evil of action carries 
with it the breach of the obligation to do 
one's duty. No ivory tower is remote 
enough to offer protection against the 
guilt in which the actor and the bystander, the oppressor and the oppressed, the 
murderer and his victim are inextricably 
enmeshed.""

This is similar to Weber's view of ""responsibility"".
And later in the piece:

&gt;""To know with despair 
that the political act is inevitably evil, 
and to act nevertheless, is moral courage. 
To choose among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment. 
In the combination of political wisdom, 
moral courage, and moral judgment man 
reconciles his political nature with his 
moral destiny. That this conciliation is 
nothing more than a modus vivendi, uneasy, precarious, and even paradoxical, 
can disappoint only those who prefer to 
gloss over and distort the tragic contradictions of human existence with the 
soothing logic of a specious concord.""

This is the reason why people generally become disillusioned with politicians, believe ""all politics are evil"", or engage in political discourse that consists largely of moral outrage at the dirtiness, duplicity and violence involved in politics. It's also why the history of political movements that promise to govern by principles of common good (social democrats, Green parties, etc.) often is seen by disaffected members as a series of betrayals and failures to live up to convictions.",052f2d79904c87db53981a6a43f36b6804c86423,True,False,,,,,0,1650697697,,0,{},i5uoaev,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i5syy9p,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i5uoaev/,1650697712,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650668897.0

[],False,,ParkerMeredith,,,[],,,,text,t2_794bqphv,False,False,"My independent analysis of the war in Ukraine and a strategic move made by Indonesia...

I feel like some will read the article I have shared and not like Indonesia's decision. 

I however, believe it is a very strategic move and highlights the importance of food export ""levers"" in our globalized economy.  

I want to connect this to the issues in Ukraine. I believe this war is mostly about control over the ports along the Black Sea and capturing the incredibly productive farmland in the Ukraine (look at food export data). It could also even be about control over the Dnipro river, a very strategic waterway leading to the ""heart"" of Russia.

Once captured, I think Putin believes Russia will have an additional ""lever of power"" (food exports, waterway for imports) and significantly more export capacity through newly controlled ports in the Black Sea.

Indonesia's move will lift the digital veil that shrouds these power politics and hopefully the world will decide it is better to distribute power rather than consolidate it. (I like democracy an freedom personally)

My analysis is that Indonesia's move will both increase food prices globally and increase sovereign nations resolve to condemn the war in Ukraine. 

Just some thoughts I had.

And you are free to interpret it that way. I see it as two nations who both have an interest in checking Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific. This is a give-and-take relationship based on mutual interest however. The Americans are not going to beg for Indian support as some in this thread seem to be insinuating. Why should they?

Hungary is actually a parliamentarian system (which actually isn't that hard to turn into strongman autocracy either under the right circumstances ), wherein the power to execute policies is vested in the Prime Minister who is Victor Orban. Unlike , say Erdogan, Orban is more comfortable with the increased leeway to act that being a Prime Minister offers, and has made no sign that he may want to get an upgrade.
