GER business elite puts pressure on govt. Govt drags its feet in order not to anger business elite. That SPD is permeated by people who have been bought by RUS amplifies the pressure.

All the GER actors are unwilling to comprehend the world has changed. No surprises this far as they are a bunch of boomers basically stuck in the 199x mindset.The surprise for our elites will be that their idea of having the cake (being protected by NATO) and eat it (having best business relations with RUS) wont work any longer. They will try to make it work desperately but pressure from population and allies will make it an impossible endeavour. With their desperate attempts they will undermine their own credibility as they are doing now.

&gt; Taipei, April 22 Taiwan announced Friday a donation of US$8 million in funds collected from private citizens to Ukraine to help ease the impact of Russia&amp;#039;s invasion on Ukrainians.

&gt; Taiwan first sent 27 metric tons of medical supplies at the end of February for distribution by Poland to Ukrainian refugees in that country and Ukrainian citizens who remained in their home country.

&gt; More than US$20 million raised in the government campaign has already been donated to Ukraine&amp;#039;s neighbors who are providing help to Ukrainian refugees, the ministry said.

U.S. hasn't used them routinely since 2003, with only a single strike in 2009, and originally planned to eliminate most stockpiles (including all the rockets) by 2019.  Trump in 2017 waived that, but it's unclear how far along the U.S. was in already eliminating their stockpiles.  From 2008 to 2017 the U.S. only allowed systems that left fewer than 1% of the bomblets unexploded to be used, and there was only a single aerial bomb design that met that requirement.  We may still have an export ban on them, so we might not even be able to give them to Ukraine without Congressional approval.

Most of NATO lies behind a line of Romania/Poland/Estonia/Finland that also did not sign the cluster munition ban but have pledged to only use them on their own territory (those countries did sign the land mine ban; and cluster munitions now largely fill that role for slowing an attack wave).

This piece shows how many states and companies have either knowingly or na√Øvely traded to support Russian armaments industry. This was enabled by poor enforcement of 2014 sanctions and lax political leadership, especially in the EU. This has enabled Russia to manufacture and maintain sophisticated weapon systems that it would not have had otherwise. The trade was significant and enabled Russia to undertake its offensive in Ukraine in 2022, and has helped Russians kill and maim and destroy combatants and civilians in Ukraine.

Companies alone are not responsible.  Governments control exports, especially trade in the armaments industry, and Governments are supposed to police sanctions, as should international organisations such as the EU. This has been done appallingly and with terrible consequences. I am sure most citizens in the democratic countries that traded arms support with Russia would be horrified if they knew what had been done in their names. Herein lies a key part of the problem. Democratic governments should be accountable to their electorate, and transparency is partial at best when it comes to arms exports. It seems large numbers of these states have been far less than transparent to their electorates.

#####Suddenly there are new German drones on the front line

Sometimes German weapons reach Ukraine in their own way, without the help of the hesitant German government. Millionaires from Ukraine have now unceremoniously put their own money on the table for particularly coveted drones from a Munich-based start-up - and have already sent for the first examples. The Bavarian company is happy about the worldwide advertising effect.

From the British point of view, the Germans currently appear as shirkers and incompetents. First they don't want to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons, then they stick to Russian energy imports.  
If things go on like this, a commentator in the Telegraph recently said, sanctions against Germany should be seriously considered.  

All the more astonished many Britons just looked at a report of the venerable London ""Times"", which lies at odds with these clich√©s. According to the report, Ukraine wants to have its artillery fire controlled from the air by a new type of German high-tech drone. The flying computer, manufactured by a Munich start-up, is called Vector. Cost: 180,000 euros.  
Rich Ukrainians paid out of their own pockets
Vector? An enquiry at the Berlin Ministry of Defence led to a shrug of the shoulders on Thursday: they had ""never heard"" of drones of this type, a spokesman said. Whether someone in Ukraine had perhaps ordered something directly from a German manufacturer, one could not say.  

After criticism of the German government: Ukraine has received this many weapons from Germany  
It is a long list: Machine guns, anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank guns have already been supplied by Germany to Ukraine.  
¬© Source: dpa
Exactly. The German high-tech delivery, which sparked acclaim elsewhere in the world, had smoothly passed the department of Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD).  
""Our first drones are actually already in Ukraine,"" Florian Seibel (42), CEO of Munich-based manufacturer Quantum Systems, told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland. Further deliveries are planned for the next few days, he said.  
The Ukrainians snatched the Vector drone out of his hands: Quantum Systems CEO Florian Seibel.

Seibel studied at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich and spent 16 years in the German Air Force before setting up his own business as the founder of Quantum Systems. Seibel could not have imagined just a few years ago that his drones would soon be sailing towards a real war mission. The Ukrainians have now, roughly speaking, snatched the Vector drone from his hands. Five days passed between the initial contact and the conclusion of the contract, then three Ukrainian fighters already sent a selfie with drone back to Bavaria with a cheerful gesture.
Ukrainian multimillionaires quickly paid the purchase price out of their own pockets, as a ""donation to the territorial command for the defense of Dnipro"". The connection between the fighters and the company in Bavaria was established by the Ukrainian consul in Munich.",ac9565eb189ce4821819a7b9735336eefd2ab51c,True,False,,,,,0,1650702546,,0,{},i5uu34s,False,t3_ua0qdt,False,True,t3_ua0qdt,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ua0qdt/suddenly_new_german_drones_are_at_the_front/i5uu34s/,1650702558,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650673746.0

Kyiv‚Äôs arsenal boosted by Soviet-era T-72 tanks from European Nato allies ‚Äì and they could prove crucial on the flat terrain of the Donbas.


Thanks to European resupplies, Ukraine‚Äôs military now has more tanks on the battlefield than Russia does, according to the Pentagon.


Two months into the war, the delivery of Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Kyiv from the Czech Republic and other European Nato allies has effectively eroded Russia‚Äôs advantage, experts have claimed.


‚ÄúRight now, the Ukrainians have more tanks in Ukraine than the Russians do, and they certainly have the purview to use them,‚Äù an unnamed senior US defence official told reporters on Thursday.


Ukraine's armed forces have previously claimed Russia has lost more than 680 of its tanks, the majority of which were destroyed, while some changed hands after being found abandoned.


A wealth of video footage has emerged online of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles on fire, while others appear to be rusting by the side of roads in rural Ukraine, or being towed by Ukrainian tractors.


Experts have put the significant Russian losses down to the advanced anti-tank weapons Western nations have given to Ukraine, as well as poor maintenance, and lagging morale among Moscow‚Äôs recruits.


‚ÄúThat the Ukrainian army has reached ‚Äòtank parity‚Äô with the Russians in Ukraine is significant,‚Äù said Mick Ryan, a retired Army major general and adjunct fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.


‚ÄúTerrain in the east is more conducive to combined arms manoeuvre, and numbers will matter. So will good leadership and tactics, which is where the Ukrainians hugely outmatch the Russians.‚Äù


It was reported last month that Ukraine had more tanks as of March than it did at the February 24 start of the war. At the time of Russia‚Äôs invasion, the country boasted around 2,000 tanks.


Ukraine had managed to capture at least 161 from Russia on the battlefield, according to the military analysis site Oryx. For its part, Russia has captured 43 Ukrainian tanks, according to analysts who study photos and videos on social media.


The Ukrainian army has so far enjoyed the advantage of ‚Äúinterior‚Äù supply lines that are contained inside their own defensive perimeter, whereas Russia has them strung out along unguarded highways.


The senior US defence official said that Russia is trying to learn from those mistakes as it shifts its ground operations away from northern Ukraine to Donbas in the east and Mariupol in the south.



The official noted that about two dozen Russian battalion tactical groups are being refitted and resupplied.



It is not clear what the overall count of tanks is on either side, or whether Russia‚Äôs efforts to resupply those units will ultimately shift the balance of tanks engaged in Ukraine in Moscow‚Äôs favour.


Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have been relying on the older T-72 model tanks.



While not the most advantaged military kit, the T-72 are versatile, and unlike many Western tanks, equipped for tough terrain and the deep-fording of rivers.



The US has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, however, it has not offered any tanks to Ukraine because its military is using Soviet-era equipment.



The Biden administration has supplied Ukraine with at least 4,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles since the beginning of the invasion. Javelins can be fired so that the missile explodes on the top of a tank, where the armour is weakest.



Ukraine now has a 10-to-1 ratio of anti-armour missiles to Russian tanks.



President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new $800 million commitment to Ukraine, including dozens of howitzers and tactical drones to fight Russia in the contested eastern Donbas region.



Mr Biden said the package was specifically designed to deal with the region‚Äôs flatter territory.



Russian president Vladimir Putin expected to overwhelm Ukraine with his military advantages, but nearly two months later, those advantages are vanishing, and the Ukrainians have put up a stiff resistance.",ff2fb0f6dc61c090435bd2775822c63afc69a0c9,True,False,,,,,0,1650672965,,0,{},i5th486,True,t3_u9sogy,False,True,t3_u9sogy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u9sogy/ukraine_now_has_more_tanks_on_the_battlefield/i5th486/,1650672983,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650644165.0
