And that would be foolish because many 5.56 loads are still lethal at that range, especially area fire (hitting something larger than a man sized point target). Lethality suffers, as does barrier penetration, but they would still wound and kill, and their accuracy doesn't drop off until they go transonic (M855A1 is roughly 750 meters). 

The biggest hurdle that allowed the Taliban to take advantage of long range harassing fire with PKMs, RPGs, SPG-9s, etc, was that most US troops weren't taught how to engage at long range. Not only weren't they actually taught how to make accurate point target shots beyond 300-500 meters, not even area suppression requiring much less precision and accuracy. The only individuals actively trained to engage further are designated marksman (whose training isn't standardized or that good), snipers (whose training is good but few attend/graduate it), machine gunners and mortarmen.  

However, with a M4A1, M855A1 ammo, and an ACOG, a properly trained infantryman should be able to engage accurately with area suppressive fires 600-750 meters, assuming someone can help them find the targets, tell them the range, give good fire control directions, help spot shots, etc. Which unfortunately didn't happen during the war, at least not standardized.",58a19990a73bfa7f480875f7fed2431665ba1d00,True,False,,,,,0,1650754848,,0,{},i5xmldj,False,t3_u8p84n,False,True,t1_i5n34tb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8p84n/effectiveness_of_the_individual_riflemen_in_an/i5xmldj/,1650754866,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650726048.0

First, they are simple to operate. If one goes down for maintenance, you send some guys in a truck out to fix it. You dont have to wonder if it still exists, you can send someone out to poke their head into the silo and verify its still there, kind of like checking on a new born baby. They are not going to sink like a sub, or crash like a b-52, they just sit there, an accident affects one missile at a time.  

Second, they dont depend anything, the silos are probably the original ones built back in the 1970s, everyone knows where they are; there are no secrets left about them, and this does not affect their operational effectiveness at all.  

Contrast this with subs, who depend on stealth (not a submariner, or in the navy, this is just me looking at maps). Currently, every SSBN the US has starts it patrol by going through a 3000 foot channel on the east coast, or a 1.4 mile one on the west coast. Their ability operate depends on them being able to safely transit these areas. You want to assume the Russians cannot develop and quietly deployed some new long life mines that just sit in the channel until they want a free SSBN? I am not saying its easy, I am just saying that out of all the ocean, they just need to target about 2 square miles where they know the subs will exist.

If you let most naturally started fires burn, it keeps the fuel levels under control and most established and healthy trees survive the fires, but people living in and near the forests are placed in danger on a more regular basis and they have to pay closer attention to maintaining defensible space around their houses.

Prescribed burns sometimes get out of control.   Mechanically removing the underbrush is also pretty disruptive to the forest ecosystem.

This is something that was discovered basically 40 years ago (I think under Kennedy?) - if the only threat you can ever make is ""I'll nuke you"" you don't actually have a threat for the vast majority of situations, like this one.

Sure, if Moscow is threatened, he'll nuke us, weewoo.  But Moscow is not being threatened.  Fucking Saratov isn't being threatened.  You talk about Crimea, but that's probably months if not a year from being threatened, and to be honest I doubt the Ukrainians are gonna.

Most geopolitical interests large states have aren't actually ""nukeable"" since turns out ""I'll kill the entire human race"" isn't a very flexible deterrent.  This is one of those circumstances - Russia is conducting an invasion of another state (one that, despite what the Kremlin squeals, has few to any ways to threaten the Russian mainland), the Kremlin's ability to respond nuclearly is very limited.

And sure, this is predicate on the conditions of today.  But this war is an invasion of Ukraine, and will remain in that state probably until the fall if not later.  I don't think Ukraine intends to launch any invasions of the Russian mainland.  Crimea is more possible, but that's still far away (if ever) and if Ukraine is doing **that** well, the parameters would have shifted to the point where discussing it now is pointless.

I'd argue that flexibility (ie bombers) is over emphasized, but I think the reality of today's environment is that strategic bombers are multi-use, and their ability to deploy nuclear weapons represents a reasonable ""value add"".

For the ICBMs, the argument really devolves to:

* ICBM silos act as a nuke sink. Since they are literally stationary known targets, their very existence will force attackers to dedicated a substantial proportion of warheads to counter-force.

* If you're willing to play with magical scenarios where an enemy can actually reach out somehow and disrupt strategic assets prior to nuclear strike, ICBMs represent a relatively dispersed, hardened force that would be difficult to disrupt. As noted, SSBNs and strategic bombers operate out of a relatively small handful of bases that represent concentrations of risk.

I suspect that the first point (that ICBMs greatest value is in being targets) contributes a lot to the low morale in the missile force.",a6e8ba76f226c12a67b02dff70b36809d7556454,True,False,,,,,0,1650743479,,0,{},i5wxyfp,False,t3_ua8wp0,False,True,t1_i5wm1hk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua8wp0/nuclear_hell_on_wheels_examining_the_need_for_a/i5wxyfp/,1650743493,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650714679.0

You say that is if Putin could easily turn this into a full scale war with the blessing of the Russian people. There's little evidence this is the case currently.

&gt; ""[Russian current actions in occupied territories] are not supporting diplomatic solution. They demonstrate that any negotiation process is fiction and political theater so far""—Zelenskyy

&gt; ""We are fighting for the right to live and for independence. We are not considered an independent state by the Russian government and, unfortunately, by a large part of society. They do not respect our culture, values, language, people...and therefore our right to live""—Zelenskyy

&gt; ""Now we see a change in the attitude of our partners. Especially the change in speed [of aid] from the United States. If this pace increases, if the steps correspond to the words, as soon as Ukraine gets enough weapons, we will immediately liberate our territories""—Zelenskyy

It's easy to focus in on whether Russia has advanced 5km or 10km over a week in the Donbas, but I think there is way too much emphasis on that in the discourse right now. This war has always been political in nature, above the tactical and strategic level, because Russian goals involve political realignment of Ukrakne. 

The last few weeks have produced a marked shift in the politics of this war against Russia. Three major points:

1) Russian actions on occupied Ukraine have basically killed any chance of a political settlement. Russia's macro aims have gone from realigning Kyiv to grabbing as much territory as they can, even if that territory is restive and burdensome to the Russian state. In short, this war has turned into a punative expedition against Ukraine.

2) Russia's military capabilities are degrading while Ukraines are increasing. The UA fields more armor and will soon have superior artillery. There is a point in the future, not certain but probable, at which Ukraine's military will have superior weapons, superior numbers, and superior morale along the entire front.

3) Ukraine's western ""allies"" have stepped up support for Kyiv to the point that Kyiv feels comfortable withdrawing from all peace talks. Although Zelenskyy doesn't say this directly, Kyiv's political goals have expanded from staving off Russian occupation to winning the war outright. They have abandoned attempts to negotiate a ceasefire and now appear ready to continue, maybe even escalate this war into years if they need to.

In short, don't be so itently focused on what villiages Russia is currently taking heavy casualties trying to occupy.

The situation is the same as it ever was. Russia doesn't just need to take land, they need to force a political settlement. Otherwise they will be fighting this war against the increasingly well-armed UA while their economy slowly grinds to a halt.

The UA already has more armor in the field than Russia, and given the elite units chewed up in the first wave, both sides are fielding mainly similar modernized T-72s at this point. The UA artillery capacity is going to outstrip Russia's in the near-term future, especially as Ukraine gets PGMs and superior counter battery radar. And who knows what else is next.

Russia may very well achieve tactical victory in Donbas. But they are already very much failing to acheive their true political goals, which is to deal a blow to the UA that will knock them out of the fight. If anything, Kyiv's incentives to accept a political settlement have disappeared over the last month. And that's not just moral outrage at Bucha. The UA's military capacity is increasing, their C2 is demonstrated to be superior, they have superior morale and political willpower, and their military is only getting stronger as weapons pour in. 

Russia may very well force the UA out of the Donbas, at great cost. But they will likely never be able to force Kyiv to come to a political settlement to stop fighting. And with Russia unable to manufacture new tanks, planes, or PGMs, it would only be a matter of time before Ukraine would have superiority across the front.

It's a bit early to say because anything can happen and the fog of war is real. But it's been apparent since the second week of the invasion that Russia does not have the military strength to force a political settlement. Unless there are surprise developments, Russia's Easter Offensive is just as much a dead man walking as the attack on Kyiv.",47148d88648e5ffb9a906bae7e91370d6397fc3c,True,False,,,,,0,1650736758,,0,{},i5wj2jl,False,t3_ua3vr7,False,True,t1_i5wdb0c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua3vr7/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_23_2022/i5wj2jl/,1650736769,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650707958.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"1- Money: I'm no economist but I seriously don't believe they could have afforded to massively expand even before the sanctions of this war started, I definitely don't think they can do it now. Not without taking societal measures even Stalin's ghost would think are a bit extreme.

2- Politics: Putin didn't seek any sort of public approval before invading Ukraine, he probably didn't bother because he thought it would be a cake walk. Hence Special Military Operation. He's since been massively weakened politically as he's not only in charge but viewed by many as the chief cause of this war. He might or might not have been the architect, we really don't know yet but I'd say there is a strong chance he's not. But he's still in bed with those that were, in a position where he gave the Go on an operation that shouldn't have been allowed if he was competent, sane, honest (for a Russian politician), and all the things he tries to appear for the Russian people. 

Does he have the political capital right now to pass or dictate draconian economic and societal laws while expanding the military, to devote the Russian population and economy for a war already destroying their military and economy? It's more likely he and most Russians wants this abortion over and done with ASAP, but they want to do it while claiming they ""won."" They'll keep grinding until they do. 

3- Time: to feed in reserves to backfill depleted combat units would likely take 1-6 months*, with the time differences depending on the readiness of the reservist, their training and competence that they retained after being discharged, and whether they need a short to long amount of retraining to make them useful. But it's still a major commitment as those are 2 million men who probably now have jobs, families, potential to cause trouble if Shanghaied back into service for an unpopular war. 

To ""quickly"" create a small number of new combat, combat support, and support units specifically to beef up Task Force Broke Dick in Ukraine is far easier said than done. It means needing the full strength of properly trained reservists and future contract troops/conscripts, but also a cadre from existing force structure of officers, NCOs, and some experienced junior enlisted. 

They don't have the overall strength where there are many key personnel uncommitted in useless assignments where catching orders to new units wouldn't grossly disrupt the old unit (realistically, many of the units they'll strip for cadre would be in Ukraine and already seriously hurting for manpower). So that means a very small number of mobilized units can be created in the short term (3-6 months), with most requiring a total commitment by Russia to dramatically reform their military system back to mass conscription of both officers and enlisted, which means tapping into all Russian classes to include the power elite, not just the poor who normally can't afford what's necessary to avoid conscription (which goes back to political and popular support). So we're talking years for that, even if they rush it the first of their Z War new army wouldn't even be ready till probably the winter frost offensive in  2023-4.

My guess is that this war ends operationally by summer and lines become very stable until Ukraine has the military power to counterattack, which Russia might try to deter using nuclear threat. At that point it'll come down to negotiations, concessions by all sides, and some sort of legit ceasefire or peace deal goes into effect.

Looking at the terrain from Google earth your right. Its very flat but that both works in favor of the defender and the attacker. Flat unobstructed terrain makes you easy pickings for defensive positions and makes hiding as a defender a lot more difficult as well.

The Result is you get two, very flat, natural chokepoints and anywhere else is basically a shallow lake. Not very many options for Ukraine there. in terms of offense. As for the defenders they can simply fall back away from the chokepoint and create a circular defense aimed at the chokepoint. Any attempt to take Crimea I think would be very bloody. And not just for the attacker if they can breakout of the 5km long chokepoint and move into the country its lights out for the defender nowhere to run but the sea. As such Russian forces would dig in and fight like hell to prevent death and they have a far greater reason to fight for Crimea than Ukraine.",13e635f5df516b155f5c9996e49c4333d9f753ed,True,False,,,,,0,1650733060,,0,{},i5walm3,False,t3_ua3vr7,False,True,t1_i5w78dw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua3vr7/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_23_2022/i5walm3/,1650733073,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650704260.0

But what I liked about this paper is the fact that it delves into the details that explains the equations that must be thought of when building a nuclear deterrent. 

The idea of a mobile ICBM force for the US military may not be for you but the thought process here is worth reading to see how these things are worked out in a process.

-----------------

Some quotes from the Article:

&gt; In order to assess the validity of the Nuclear Posture review’s rationale, this paper dissects the risks and rewards of a mobile ICBM force in two attack scenarios, and argues that the Nuclear Posture Review does not account for the vulnerability of the president and of the nuclear command and control system in the face of a surprise attack.

&gt; The final section examines the conditions that must be present in order to favor the fielding of a U.S. mobile ICBM force. The first condition is a change in vulnerability of the SSBN force, causing its survivability to be questioned. 

&gt; The second condition is the emergence of a credible conventional threat to the U.S. silo based ICBM force. The third condition is a shift in US nuclear strategy from counterforce to counter value, to include the adoption of a minimum credible deterrence posture. 

&gt; Finally a collapse of restraints imposed by current arms control agreements could spur an arms race, changing the level of acceptable vulnerability for the land-based leg of the triad. Though certain conditions could favor the deployment of a U.S. mobile ICBM force at some point in the future, the current state of the geo-strategic landscape does not support such an acquisition. 

—————————

&gt; The elimination of the silo-based ICBM force greatly simplifies enemy targeting, reducing aim points from 425 (assuming 420 ICBMs) to 5 (3 bomber bases and 2 SSBN bases) to effectively nullify the US nuclear arsenal in a surprise attack.

&gt; The quandary posed to adversaries by the silo based ICBM is best understood in terms of “price to attack”. If an adversary chooses to attack the United States, they must expend 2.1 warheads for every Minuteman III silo to ensure it’s destruction.

&gt; Russia would have to expend 882 of its 1550 operationally deployed warheads to destroy just 420 single-warhead silo based US ICBMs. The price to attack a garrison -based (non-dispersed mobile ICBM is 0.6 warheads expended for every warhead destroyed.",633cc55009e8b099b7297427119eaabf2c1c3329,True,False,,,,,0,1650731072,,0,{},i5w62ug,True,t3_ua8wp0,False,True,t3_ua8wp0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua8wp0/nuclear_hell_on_wheels_examining_the_need_for_a/i5w62ug/,1650731084,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650702272.0

&gt;This is a risky operation. UKR forces have been reinforcing around Kharkiv, and attacking to threaten the Russian ground lines of communication for this offensive. Even if Russian forces make significant gains, they could be pressed to hold territory and vulnerable afterwards. 4/ 

Ukraine is pushing East from Kharkiv hard into the rear of the Russian lines advancing from Izyum. Imagine being encircled when you're the attacker. Guess it turns out maybe Russia shouldn't have said ""fuck it, I give up on Kharkiv"" after all... 😂

Taking territory is one thing, *holding on to it* is another. What equipment will Russia even have left to exert control over the territory should they succeed? 

&gt;Russian forces have taken heavy losses in manpower and equipment, with far fewer combat effective formations available. **Not clear what we are calling ‘BTGs’ at this point and their level of manning**. Russian reinforcements are far from sufficient to replace earlier losses. 6/ 

lol the slight bit of sass from Koffman. 

&gt;Even still, it’s unclear if the southern axis of the planned offensive will be more than a fixing action. The Southern Military District's forces have been mauled over 2 months of fighting. This means a larger operational envelopment is probably beyond their means to support. 8/ 

**If he's saying they're being mauled, yep they're getting their ass kicked.** 

&gt;Russian forces in the southwest around Kherson city are struggling to consolidate a defensible perimeter west of the river. The units deployed there are relatively light, and under pressure. They could even be forced over time to retreat east across the Dnipro. 9/ 

Really hope Ukraine pushes them out before Russia can hold another sham ""referendum"" to make another ""people's republic"". Don't need another ""state"" tankies simp for. 

&gt;Expansion of support to include armor, IFVs, and artillery is going to allow Ukraine to replace losses and equip reserve brigades (esp artillery and ammunition which Ukraine needs). Hence the general trajectory of correlation of forces in this war is not in Russia’s favor. 11/

&gt;If the Russian military sends units in piecemeal, sticking to roads, with narrow advances – they will be defeated by UKR as they have in other battles. I’ve seen them make adjustments in some areas, but some of the problems are structural. 12/

&gt;Donbas is a relatively urban region. Russian forces likely need Severodonetsk to control Luhansk and Slovyansk + Kramatorsk in order to claim they have captured Donetsk. These could end up prolonged and costly fights in urban terrain. 15/ 

Ukraine's armament by the West only continues to grow by the day and Russia's available fleet of tanks, IFVs, and APCs only continue to shrink from their already slim pickings. Russia bypassed Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv because they were too scared to engage in urban combat. The fight for the Donbas is going to be a mess if it's as urban as Koffman says it is.

So in essence: ""Do I think that the Russian troops and officers were dealt a bad hand? by a politician who isn't some expert general but rather a KGB spook?"".... Absolutely. They were given a last second goal, a last second battle plan and apparently half of them didn't even know they were in Ukraine at the start of the invasion. This all stinks of a Adolf Hitler style ""I know better than my generals moment"", Even so I still think that if the vast majority of Russian Officers felt this disillusioned they would likely have at least told Putin that he needs to pump the brakes a little. Even if it meant they had to word it in a very careful way...   


And if you were to read my other comments on my profile I sympathize with this likelihood (Especially earlier on). I think the Incident between Russia's minister of intelligence and Putin was a clear sign of things to come. The obvious hesitancy to confirm what should have been an easy question to answer even if your not corrupt shows to me he knew exactly how this was going to play out. Most importantly he knew what would happen to him if he didn't give the answer Putin was looking for.  


I also do believe that the Russian troops are getting the short end of the stick (I expressed as much in my first comment on this thread.) They quite clearly are angry, confused, and generally disillusioned with this whole operation. And its fairly easy to see the reasons why they feel this way. I have no doubt that there are SOME officers who dont like any of this and have major problems with the war. But I also think there exists some (perhaps only a small contingent) who generally dont regard their men with much of any respect. In particular I think such officers exist at the top where they dont have much interaction with the average Russian private or NCO and are very disconnected from what happens on the battlefield.  


In terms of their doctrine I still think the idea of mass offensives is still somewhat embedded somewhere in their doctrine (and ill explain why I think that way):  


Granted they have seemingly tried to move to a more modern tactical small scale type of conflict, However as you pointed out they were in regards to this operation given no plan, no warning, little post first action supply allowance, and just generally expected to win quickly and easily.   


When that didn't happen what did they fall back on? The same doctrine they've known for decades. Shell with artillery then perform a combined arms push with armor spearheading with a plan to encircle enemy units cut off by the maneuver.   


In essence what im saying is that while they ""tried"" to move away from their old doctrine they never truly abandoned it all together. Their Field officers didn't immediately fall back on the modern doctrine principles but instead on their older more entrenched doctrine. Now how much that fallback was based on them being unable to execute their more modern tactics is something we will/may only know when the fog of war clears. But my point is that an army that truly embraced a different doctrine would have fallen back on it rather than the prior one.

Its pointless, its stupid, it quite clearly wont end well for either side, with both sides taking a ridiculous beating all amounting to a pointless power play that didn't do Russia any favors anyway.",50b3c1cd80fa64f1622ec016148fe50de4c5b5a2,True,False,,,,,0,1650727066,,0,{},i5vwzk9,False,t3_u9cyxj,False,True,t1_i5vq01p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9cyxj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_22_2022/i5vwzk9/,1650727081,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650698266.0

One plausible scenario to avoid the worst of this is for Russia to declare victory as de-Nazifying and reaffirming control of Crimea, and blaming the failures of the other components on Belarus and LPR / DPR. If Russia agreed to withdraw completely from Ukraine (sans Crimea) in exchange for international recognition of Crimea and various other conditions pertaining to NATO, ethnic Russians in Ukraine, etc. I imagine there would be a lot of pressure on Ukraine to accept and end the war.

With that done, if Putin stepped down and appointed a friendlier seeming successor, I don't think it would take long at all for Russia to start chipping away at resolve for the sanctions regime. Europe has showed stunning unity and resolve so far, but it won't last forever, and there will be no second term for Biden if he can't get inflation under control with solid economic growth.

Because that's what all evidence points to and considering what awaited them any attacking force at the top of their game was still going to get hurt, but without taking it seriously (which it doesn't even seem as an option) they got absolutely hammered..

Picture being a trained private in an average motor rifle platoon that hasn't been destroyed. You took casualties since Day 1, likely your platoon leader is a casualty, as well as one of the squad leaders, plus a bunch of others in the platoon; your company is so depleted it's operating as a platoon now. Field promotions were made to try to restore command and control, but no replacements. You and everyone else have been in hard combat for two months nonstop, no breaks, with no end in sight, at the ass end of a pretty bad supply line. Vehicle and equipment maintenance isn't being done because no real time or resources for more than basic stuff. Morale has been in the shitter since day 1. 

How does that platoon get better in these conditions? They should have been good at day 1 and gotten a bit better as they shed training flaws to replace by combat lessons until they reach a point they're too tired and their performance degrades until they're given a rest. Instead they got absolutely hammered in the early days and never even got to demonstrate good, and weren't given the opportunities to learn from those earlier mistakes as they can't even rebuild themselves from losses they took. 

I get everyone in Ukraine knows what has happened and is going on now is total bullshit. The right thing to do is obvious, take an operational pause, everything reverts to economy of force defensive operations, start rotating units to rear area rest camps for R&amp;R, send in whatever manpower and equipment replacements they can to reconstitute, mobilize the country for war, rebuild their military. But that's not what the senior brass is doing. Instead they're following orders from the top (Putin) to keep attacking. Are they doing it because they don't care about their troops? I doubt it, but all commanders care about their troops, even Russian ones, especially since those commanders eagerly pushed for reforms to make a more professional force, to create doctrine going away from Cold War era mass offensives, fully recognize the current Russian system and culture can't take historic rates of losses. Despite all that they're still giving orders to attack because it's their duty, because that's their job, to follow orders and the mission ALWAYS comes first.

&gt;Multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI) is a modern version of the earlier time on target concept. MRSI is when a single gun fires multiple shells to all arrive at the same target simultaneously. This is possible because there is more than one trajectory for a round to fly to any given target. Typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by using different sized propellant charges with each shell, it is possible to utilize more than two trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air (and travel farther), they take longer to reach the target. If shells are fired on higher trajectories for initial volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and later volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, with the correct timing the shells will all arrive at the same target simultaneously. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;MRSI has a few prerequisites. The first is guns with a high rate of fire. The second is the ability to use different sized propellant charges. Third is a fire control computer that has the ability to compute MRSI volleys and the capability to produce firing data, sent to each gun, and then presented to the gun commander in the correct order.  
&gt;  
&gt;...

I agree with a lot of people who suggest that this is the **True** turning point of the war... If Russia fails in Donbas then they are at a serious dilemma. Their current deployed forces clearly aren't sufficient for a long year or multi year campaign. They would be forced to begin bringing in more reservist's which will only damage public opinion back in Russia. **(Personally I think this is the likely outcome as the latter option im about to mention would be a political catastrophe for Russia domestically.)**  


The other option is they desperately try to declare some kind of ceasefire or temporary peace terms with the belief that Zelensky and his government will agree to it to try and stop the violence against civilians. This I dont see as likely to happen. It would be a domestic political shitshow and embarrass Russia domestically and abroad. It also relies a lot on Zelensky and his government's outlook of the war and whether they consider it worth trying to go on the offensive and try to retake currently Russians occupied ground.  


And even with all this in the end the Russians economy is likely to implode if this goes any further than it already has. So I dont see a way out for Russia that dosent either lead to long term collapse, fracturing, or even hermit state status...

You put in 1/10 of the effort the other person has to put in. Well then don't be surprised if they don't respond.

Like you claim their economy isn't getting any bigger but that's easily looked up. They're projected to grow at [around 5%.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/China-GDP-forecast-to-grow-5-in-2022-Nikkei-survey) Not too bad considering they're still doing their stupid (in my opinion) zero covid strategy. The IMF estimates their nominal GDP to grow to [$19.9 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal\)) this year, which sounds insane to me considering it was only estimated $14.7 trillion by the WB and UN in 2020. But take it up with the IMF I guess. They're not growing, they only grew by one Japan in a few years. A very small economy as we all know.

You say they couldn't even beat India with sticks, but the whole reason there were sticks is so that it's harder to turn into a shooting war. Both sides showed restraint. I'm not sure what China's goals were during the 2020 border clash but they did [gain a couple hundred km2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57234024) and moved the line of control in their favor.

You mention so much higher end tech items being manufactured elsewhere now. ""so much"" is too vague. How much exactly? How many companies have actually left China? What type of companies are leaving? Is it textile companies or electronics companies? The latter is probably more important to them. How many companies are staying and perhaps even growing their operations? How many new companies are coming in? These are important questions.

Quotes from the Article:

&gt; In 2014, Zachary Keck argued in The Diplomat that “D-Day would fail today” because “modern defense technologies have made amphibious invasions much more difficult.” Four years before that, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told the press, “Looking ahead, I do think it is proper to ask whether large-scale amphibious assault landings . . . are feasible.” But this is not just a twenty-first-century assessment. All the way back in 1949, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Omar Bradley famously told the House Armed Services Committee that “large-scale amphibious operations will never occur again.” Even earlier, in the wake of the amphibious disaster at Gallipoli, “the general conclusion [among military professionals] was that large scale amphibious operations against a defended shore, especially conducted in daylight, were almost certain to be suicidal.” The list of military thinkers who have doubted the efficacy of amphibious operations is long indeed.

&gt; The Russian navy has long been convinced of the importance of amphibious capability—it executed numerous amphibious operations during World War II as part of Russia’s campaign in Manchuria, in the Baltics, and along the Black Sea. Moscow tried to expand its capability several years ago with the purchase of two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships from France, which would have represented a significant upgrade over the older vessels the Russian navy operates. But the deal fell through after the invasion of Crimea in 2014. One of the major gaps in Russian amphibious capability is aviation, and the Mistrals would have given the Russian navy a new platform to launch amphibious air assaults from. 

&gt; History, however, also lends itself to assessing how amphibious capabilities feature in Russian military culture. Soviet doctrine in World War II, which seems to remain a major focal point of Russian military planning, offered several types of amphibious operations, ranging from strategic landings to those of a tactical nature. Overall, the Soviets conducted more than one hundred amphibious landings during World War II, including several from the Black Sea, with varying degrees of success. The most frequently practiced was one that inserted small units—companies or battalions—behind German lines to pin down enemy forces, disrupt enemy rear areas, and secure objectives ahead of the advancing land forces. Amphibious operations, in and of themselves, were rarely more than an advance operation for a larger ground push. It is these small-scale, tactical landings that are most likely in Ukraine, and would be intended to support larger ground operations. These landings could help a coastal axis of advance, for example, bypassing tough Ukrainian defensive positions.

&gt; Ultimately, Russian amphibious forces are valuable even without doing much. As long as they are in the region, the threat of an amphibious operation is enough to require Ukrainian attention. Their presence forces a portion of Ukraine’s limited resources to be devoted to preparing to face an amphibious assault—on Odesa, for example—that may or may not happen. During the First Gulf War, US Marines achieved a similar effect by conducting numerous amphibious demonstrations that tied down multiple Iraqi divisions without ever coming ashore. As retired Admiral James Stavridis, the former NATO supreme allied commander, remarked, “The Russian Black Sea fleet is essentially a holding force directed against the Ukrainian military south of Ukraine.”",ed5f6fd285d1987fc18424bb68ebf02574862f53,True,False,,,,,0,1650696017,,0,{},i5um6k4,True,t3_u9z84z,False,True,t3_u9z84z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9z84z/what_can_we_learn_about_amphibious_warfare_from_a/i5um6k4/,1650696033,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650667217.0

&gt;How much equipment does Russia have in the theater. Specifically artillery, MLRS and MTB.

Like with Ukraine, not all of their cold war stock is operational, though I assume the towed howitzers haven't rusted too hard, they're lower maintenance.  

I think Russia's bottleneck in the short term isn't absolute number of artillery but how many they can get and retain on the front and how much ammo they chew through, which is definitely a lot.

The amount of bombardment they've been doing since day 1?  Even the American military industrial complex would blush.

[],False,,RichPumpkin725,,,[],,,,text,t2_aosqq6g0,False,False,"&gt;Have you read anything about the Russian military? I don't mean tweets or news articles written since the war started, but about the Russian military in the last decade plus, operational theory, doctrine, past conflicts, leadership, etc?

I have and I know that they began the conflict with seeming competency even very close to their deep battle doctrine. However shortly after the VDV failure at Hostomel airport Along with a parade of other incompetency's following shortly afterwards their whole offensive seemed to spiral into chaos and grind to a halt. It dosent help that they didn't have an overall theatre commander something that I found quite odd and very abnormal. Especially for such a large scale offensive the lack of a central command was astounding to me and confounded what I know about Russian doctrine.   


I also found it unusual that they picked this particular timing to launch their invasion during the well known Rasputitsa. There are rumors that the invasion was actually delayed for China's Olympics but that is a massive hypothetical that we wont know for sure either until this war ends or ever. Regardless it seems like Russian battle plans for this war were ill timed and they had at least a few more months they could have waited for the weather to be far better.     


Prior to this conflict I had been reading quite a few articles that suggested its military may have had some cracks beginning to form post Crimea. Stories of Russian pilots not meeting their qualified number of flight hours, stories of corruption, poor leadership, etc... When I read them at the time and reexamining older soviet conflicts. I mostly dismissed the stories as confirmation bias looking for any cracks in the Russian federation's security forces that might alleviate people's fears of a resurgent Russia.  


As for their offensive doctrine im aware that it shifted slightly in the fall of the union. However I dont think it changed all that much. It still focused on a combined arms offensive focusing around deep encircling maneuver's with armored forces leading the charge and a very heavy use of artillery and CAS aircraft like Hind's and Frogfoot's. (This is how Ukraine 2022 started so I dont believe this is inaccurate).  


In comparison to Crimea this is a disaster show. Personally I attribute their success in Crimea to a Ukrainian army which at the time was doctrinally and technologically backwards, very green and inexperienced and with a Russian army which seemed far less hampered both by the size of their goal and by a less serious global response. It also helped that the Russian people didn't need much urging on to take Crimea and their troops had a fairly simple and relatively easy goal.   


As for Chechnya I will freely admit that my knowledge is far less complete in regards to that war (it didn't help that it started a year before I was born). The predominant takeaways I have was that the initial invasion was fairly successful and went fairly well for the Russians only to devolve into a long standing insurgent conflict which became a hell up till 2005.  


I will also admit my knowledge of modern Russian Doctrine isn't the best... and that my focus often trends western.  


**Would like to clarify however:**  
   
I never said Ukrainian capabilities had nothing to do with their failures. In the end that thread of comments was specifically related to Russian soldiers living standards and medical treatment capabilities/technology. It was not focused on an analysis of their armed forces performance against the Ukrainian's. Or how the above mentioned capabilities would be diminished by such a conflict.  


I was trying to point out that in comparison to an Army like the US or other western armies in general there dosent **appear** to be a similar treatment in terms of living standards and that such a trend would support the stories of poor Russian morale both short term in relation to this war and likely long term (prior to this conflict).   


Finally I believe it would be nothing short of inaccurate to say that corruption and elitism is not pervasive amongst Russian high command. Many former soviet officers and bureaucrat's transferred along to the Russian federation post union collapse and I very much doubt that they dont engage in a form of selective promotion. IE. Loyalty and corruption count more than merit and competency. A environment like this is ripe for corruption and such elitism often creates a distancing between officer and private.   


In short the reason the comments became so unhinged and unfocused was they were a huge tangent off of the original discussion which had to do with battlefield medicine and MEDEVAC.

3. Slaves was actually an inefficient use of the workforce which Speer did not oppose.  It also caused a lot of delays and sabotage

4. Comparison to other nations he fares poorly.  US, UK, Canada, Australia, Soviets, Japan, made much more impressive gains during certain time periods.  What would the result have been with someone different than Speer? 

5. Speer himself pushed a narrative that he was some type of genius, which swayed many people.

6. Nothing about Nazi Germany production was particularly efficient when compared to peers.  In fact it was a lot less efficient in many respects in man hours, productions, designs. 

7. Virtually everyone's efficiency improved as the war went on. Standardization among suppliers, limited armament types, and simplified construction techniques/models improved. Nazi Germany wasn't an outlier. Everyone did this.

8. Omission of less successful efforts.

9. Failing to adequately use women in the workforce. 

Basically, the whole thing was a sham.  The Nazis weren't particularly adept at production, use of resources, or anything else.

Paris and Berlin sent Moscow £230m of military hardware, including bombs, rockets and missiles, that is likely being used in Ukraine

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/22/exclusive-france-germany-evaded-arms-embargo-sell-weapons-russia/

France and Germany armed Russia with €273 million (£230 million) of military hardware now likely being used in Ukraine, an EU analysis shared with The Telegraph has revealed.

They sent equipment, which included bombs, rockets, missiles and guns, to Moscow despite an EU-wide embargo on arms shipments to Russia, introduced in the wake of its 2014 annexation of Crimea.

The European Commission was this month forced to close a loophole in its blockade after it was found that at least 10 member states exported almost €350 million (£294 million) in hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Some 78 per cent of that total was supplied by German and French firms.

Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has faced fierce criticism this week for his reluctance to provide heavy weapons to Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to negotiate with Putin have seen the French president accused of appeasement.

Both Paris and Berlin have resisted an EU ban on buying gas from Russia, with the bloc currently paying Moscow €1 billion (£840 million) per day for energy supplies.

The EU report emerged as a top Russian commander said Moscow had expanded its goals to take “full control” of southern Ukraine, as well as the eastern Donbas region.

Russian forces would create a land bridge to Crimea and could push as far as the border of Moldova, said Major General Rustam Minnekayev, the deputy commander of the Russian central military district.

In New Delhi, Boris Johnson on Friday warned that Russia could still win the war, announcing plans to send British tanks to Poland so that Ukraine could receive Warsaw’s Soviet-era T-72 models.

Asked if Russia could win the war in Ukraine, the Prime Minister conceded it was a “realistic possibility” and that Moscow was very close to seizing Mariupol.

On Friday, Putin told Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, that the marines holed up in the city’s Azovstal steel plant would be allowed to live if they surrendered.

Meanwhile, Mr Scholz pointed to the threat of nuclear war as he sought to answer critics over Berlin’s reluctance to provide Ukraine with high-powered arms.

Criticism increased when it emerged that German firms had used a loophole in an EU embargo on arms exports to Russia, making sales worth €121 million (£107 million) of “dual-use” equipment, including rifles and special protection vehicles, to Moscow.

Berlin defended its use of an ambiguity within the EU’s 2014 arms blockade, insisting that the goods were sold only after the Kremlin guaranteed they were for civilian use, rather than military application.

“If there were indications of any kind of military use, the export licenses were not granted,” a spokesman for the country’s economy ministry added.

France was also found to have been responsible for sending shipments worth €152 million (£128 million) to Russia, as part of 76 export licences. Paris allowed exporters to fulfil contracts agreed before 2014, using a backdoor technicality in the EU embargo.

Alongside bombs, rockets and torpedoes, French firms sent thermal imaging cameras for more than 1,000 Russian tanks as well as navigation systems for fighter jets and attack helicopters.

Since the start of the invasion on Feb 24, the EU has introduced further restrictions on the export of dual-use items to Moscow, closing the loophole.

However, it took the bloc until its fifth package of sanctions, described as the most draconian ever introduced by Brussels, until the exemption on previously agreed arms sales to Russia was scrapped.

The French government did not comment on its use of the exemption, but has previously defended the “grandfather” clause.

The loophole, eventually closed on April 8, was only shut after mounting protests from Baltic and eastern member states.

Envoys from Poland and Lithuania ensured the text of the original 2014 arms embargo was amended when it emerged weapons were still pouring into Russia.

According to European Commission data, EU countries last year sold Russia weapons and ammunition worth €39 million (£33 million) as the Kremlin prepared for its invasion of Ukraine.

Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defence committee, said that all Nato member states should have to declare they are not sending arms to Russia at the Madrid summit in June.

“If we agree Russia now presents an existential threat to European security, then there is no excuse for any European country to continue supplying Russia arms,” he said.

Admiral Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said: “Using loopholes to avoid the EU arms embargo of Russia post the Crimean invasion is effectively a crime and breathtakingly stupid.”

A senior EU source added: “It’s time for France and Germany to wake up and get real.”

Cristian Terhes, the Romanian MEP who shared the EU analysis, said: “While Ukraine is desperately crying out for weapons to defend itself from Putin’s invasion, Germany and France are silent, but were happy enough to quietly and disgracefully sell their wares to Moscow.”

The EU report followed probes last month into Europe’s worst offenders for weapons exports to Russia by Disclose and Investigate Europe, two investigative news websites.

As well as Germany and France, Italy was responsible for sending arms worth €22.5 million (£19 million) to Moscow after the EU embargo was imposed, while Britain made sales of €2.4 million (£2 million).

Austria, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic exported €49.3 million (£41 million) between them in arms to Russia between 2015 and 2022.",9ff77c0102903acc0b23cfa9f791da074af41d13,True,False,,,,,0,1650688552,,0,{},i5ubqmq,False,t3_u9cyxj,False,True,t3_u9cyxj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u9cyxj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_22_2022/i5ubqmq/,1650688567,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650659752.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;As for relevance my point is that the Russian High command see's most of its army as DISPOSABLE. So while yes they aren't all actual conscripts in classification the Russian Government SEE's them that way. 

The opposite actually. That's why the Russian general staff and OSKs are leaning so heavily on DPR/LPR troops for bloody fighting especially in urban hellholes like Mariupol. If the Russians brass were as ruthless and stupid as you claim they'd have assaulted the city with the entire VDV and MP BTG contingency and taken in three weeks, YOLO. Instead they used as many non-Russians as possible and allowed a slow methodical advance despite the bad press they took for how long it took. 

Things are bloody because the Ukraines are competent, very well armed with extremely lethal modern weapons, provided with the best intel in any recent war, and extremely motivated, while fighting on the defensive, while Russia went in totally unprepared for a real war following the worst invasion plan in modern history that they didn't deviate from for a month plus, requiring even more aggressive tactics in a bid to end the war before the battered army is destroyed in a war of attrition they can't win in the near future.

Have you read anything about the Russian military? I don't mean tweets or news articles written since the war started, but about the Russian military in the last decade plus, operational theory, doctrine, past conflicts, leadership, etc?

Then they're not conscripts. Here's how that works: get conscripted, go wherever the military district they belong to wants to send them, get shit pay, get treated badly for 12 months. Or sign up for a contract, get better choices for assignments, get higher pay, etc, and it's only an extra 12 months It basically describes the US Navy, Air Force, and National Guard during the Vietnam War...

But militaries went through the great expense of developing and procuring those systems because they had important assets they wanted to protect, in the US's case, it's the carriers.  BM killchains aren't any harder, they're just longer.  Using simple logic here, an anti- missile defensive weapon has to hit a target that's moving incredibly fast, is potentially agile, and is relatively small.  Carriers meanwhile are huge, slow moving targets.  

Yes, ABM systems did outpace BM systems over the last few decades, but there's reasons for it that have nothing to do with the proficiency of such systems.  One, the US has very strong motives in protecting its carrier fleet and will expend prolific amounts of resources in order to so.  Two, BM's have purposely had their development stunted, largely due to political concerns.  That calculus is changing very rapidly however.  This situation can and will reverse where BM development outpaces ABM defenses because the supporting technologies are maturing to the point that will allow that to happen.  

China has over 2,000 BMs last time I checked, but maybe I'm remembering wrong?  Anyway, reusable boosters will further expand the performance capabilities of BMs beyond what any ABM defenses could keep up with.  Reusable first stage boosters can greatly extend the range of ballistic missiles and make them even cheaper to boot.  BM's are already over 3 orders of magnitude cheaper than a carrier and reusable boosters will further extend that advantage.  Quite simply, ABM defenses, and thus the utility of carriers in a conventional conflict between superpowers, won't be able to keep up.",e6895d8b3829abc2fc499c67e260bf0b2ef163c3,True,False,,,,,0,1650683753,,0,{},i5u39qj,False,t3_u7y0e3,False,True,t1_i5tyscv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7y0e3/carrier_killer_chinas_antiship_ballistic_missiles/i5u39qj/,1650683763,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650654953.0

My observation was just: expanding NATO brought it into Russia's former sphere of influence, and insofar as that happened, it probably increased the chances of nuclear war. I think you're entirely right that, on the other side of that counterfactual, having more dice bouncing at once probably means more chances of nuclear war. The pell-mell rush to aid Ukraine in the first week of the conflict. There were some eery echoes of 1914 there. If there was no NATO-wide coordination at all there, how likely is it that at least one of those countries miscalculates badly and we're *already* at war? Pretty high, I think.

I think realism is both prescriptive and descriptive, in that it appears to say, ""This is how the world works when everyone behaved rationally, *and everyone should behave rationally*."" For a whole of reasons, mostly having to do with domestic politics, I think we know that simply isn't true. I think realism is a good way to give a very high-level geopolitical overview, but if you want to understand how a very specific and complex crisis plays out, it probably isn't so much help.

Bringing all that theory talk down to Earth -- the clear error in Ukraine wasn't expanding NATO (which the realists debate), it was leaving Ukraine hung out to dry on the edge of Russian influence.

What can be inferred from a large enough sample of videos is someone's general health status as well as various signs of neurological and other abnormalities.
