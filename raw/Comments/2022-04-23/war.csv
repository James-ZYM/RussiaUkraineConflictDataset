brief background: 2014 ukraine had revolution (coup depending who you talk to), overthrowing elected leader, not everyone agree to the new government since it is not an elected representative, those who didnt agree in the east (consisting majority ethnic russians) had referendum to establish own republic, referendum overwhelmingly pass, ukraine doesnt recognize referendum and goes to war to drive out the ethnic russians. mariupol also had a referendum to join the Donetsk republic which overwhelmingly passed but ukraine again refused to recognize the results. to add insult to injury ukraine allowed azov to establish mariupol as their headquarters and has been controlling the city until recently.

these ethnic russians in the east are the ones who the media is saying russia has been abducting. i find it funny that ukraine sees them as ukranians when russia evacuates them but for the past 8 years have been actively trying to drive them out of the donbas region. official estimates are ukraine military has killed over 10,000 of these ethnic russian civilians in donbas since 2014.",8a9498cea6734d7ff1f404a18579f06f8b26dad5,True,False,,,,,0,1650741046,,0,{},i5wsoq3,False,t3_ua7gf3,False,True,t1_i5why8i,/r/war/comments/ua7gf3/footage_from_inside_a_bunker_in_azovstal_plant/i5wsoq3/,1650741060,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1650712246.0,

Snake Island soldiers one is an early example of how we have to wait for actual confirmation of what went on without making assumptions. Hence what I literally said in my first paragraph in the previous comment, „wait for any confirmation of Ukraine’s actions”.

Photos get spread around quickly and is a major issue, but it’s not exclusive to one side. Plenty of „pro-Russian” accounts posted wrong pictures at the beginning of the war, especially in March with misrepresented footage from 2014.

Important note is the severity and malitious intent of the propaganda, which the Russian side takes to a whole new level of degeneracy. Just see their TV programme news and hosts and the type of crap they say about the war. Kremlin’s own „it’s going fine”, „sanctions don’t affect us” rhetoric. „There is no war in Ukraine” - my personal favourite lol

I watched that video. I watched the suffering. That was one more video to me of more human suffering. And the  recently his brother came out on the news to give his opinion of the ""jihadi three"" being brought to justice by crown court. 

I sat for 5 minutes with my gob open; with hand over mouth; one eye on the tv: other eye looking into the memory of his brothers final moments seared into my skull - I was all ears and I couldn't help but hear silence. 


:the spin we see from all various social groups have made me sick to the core; the suffering mindlessly sidestepped. 

I knew from a young age that although Britain has it's own internal problems; things are peaceful but we have been a nation at war for decades in one form and another. 

Speaking truthfully; Ukraine being invaded had to happen: it is needless violence against innocents who look like British people. It's invoking the visceral emotional reaction that has for so long been desensitized and diluted. 

I started following the conflict in Ukraine ever since I first watched the videos of volunteers going out in groups of 10 or 15. And all coming back with their heads missing. We are 120 months almost from that time of volunteers being martyred. People have slowly been fed into an escalating grinder. 

:sidenote: I talked to a terrorist who served with the Taliban in 2004; Afghanistan. I asked him questions; basically; he lives in Indonesia, is a Muslim, is poor that $300 promised to his family a month had him fly to Pakistan twice: be armed by mystery men.....And thrown into a hot zone by whim of others. He also sent me images of mutilated corpses of innocent people and soldiers his group may or may not have done.

:back to thread: I fear that an evolving war is taking place and is unfolding as the hybrid war we see. There are people coming to fight; people that have fought before in hot zones around the world either as a Terrorist or a Mercenary. I wonder with dreaded conviction that these elements had played a role in important flash points in Ukraine at the start of the civil war. 

Basically; my point is; I fear that our wars is not about people but rather about pushing the boundaries of our nation state power and also testing the limits of our destruction.

Ukraine  will probably be rebuilt with something like a Marshall plan.  I think Betchel and companies like that are already trying to eye what the contracts and the conditions to help the Ukrainians  their country.  Ukraine is going to be a multinational bonanza.

 The longer Russia stays in the Donbass and Luhansk regions the weaker they will become which is what the US wants.  Russia may try to negotiate a settlement but if the Ukrainians think that they have the upper hand and Washington still supplies them materiel then nothing will come of negotiations.

The Russians still may win the battle for the land corridor to Transnistria which would be costly at the current rate.  I think that the Russians will run out of people before they run out of equipment. The US lost 58000 KIA in 10 years of the Vietnam War.

The defenders are more motivated, know the terrain they are fighting in better, have shorter supply lines, can maintain the political will, and most importantly, are fighting for their survival.

The longer the war drags on, the more dangerous it becomes for Putin and the Russian government. Anti-war demonstrations and government dissent are already strong inside Russia, and will intensify. The Russians can claim a partial victory and eventually retreat (e.g. securing the Donbass region), but it will be pyrrhic and Russia's global image will forever be tarnished.
