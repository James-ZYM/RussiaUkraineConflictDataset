This extract from ""Search of Purity"" (1939), Pacifists writings, by Jean Giono is long but worth reading. It is about his account of the Battle of Verdun, in which he participated as a 21 year old lad.

""You will soon understand that these low and dirty insignificant material things are much more important to you than the whole superior spirit of combat. Brutally, in the midst of a battle that seemed to be taking place for legitimate spiritual needs, you feel that in reality you have been illegally forced into a simple debate between yourself and pain, yourself and the necessity to live, yourself and the will to live, that everything is there; that if, simply you die, there is no more battle, nor homeland, nor right, nor reason, nor victory, nor defeat, and as such they made you strive painfully towards nothingness. There is no epic so glorious that the respect of its glory can pass before the needs of a digestive track. The one who built the epic with the suffering of his body knowns that during these so-called moments of glory, in fact, baseness occupies the sky.

Under Verdun's iron, soldiers are holding. For a spot I know, we hold because the gendarme prevents us from leaving. They placed stations even in the middle of the battlefield, in the support trenches, above the Tavannes' tunnel. If we want to get out of there we need an exit ticket. Stupid but exact; no, not stupid, horrific. During the beginning of the battle, some soup carriers still manage to pass through the artillery barrage, once there they need to search in their bandolier and show to the gendarmes the ticket signed by the captain. The heroism of the official press release must be controlled carefully here. We can, in good faith, say that we are staying on this battlefield because they are carefully preventing us from escaping. Regardless, here we are, here we stay, so we fight? We look like fierce attackers, but the truth is that we are running away on all sides. We are between the hospital's battery, a small fort, and the fort of Vaux, which we are tasked with reconquering. This has been going on for ten days. Every day, at the battery of the hospital' between two rows of dirt bags, they execute those they call deserters on the spot, without any trial. We can't leave the battlefield, so now we hide in it. You dig a hole, you bury yourself, you stay there. If you are found, you are dragged to the battery and, between two rows of dirt bags, your brains are blown out. Soon, every man will have to be followed by a gendarme. The general says ""They hold"". In Paris there is a historian who will soon conjugate the verb ""to hold in Verdun"" at every tense and for every pronoun, including his own. They hold, but general, I wouldn't get rid of the gendarme nor advise clemency to this colonel of the 52nd infantry regiment staying at the hospital's battery. This has been going on for fifteen days.

For the last eight days the soup carriers are not returning. They leave in the evening in the darkest of the night and it's over, they melt like sugar in coffee. Not a man returned. They were all killed, absolutely all, every time, every day, with no exception. We don't go anymore. We are hungry. We are thirsty. We see over there a dead laying on the ground, rotten and full of flies, but whose belt is still holding canteens and balls of bread held by an iron thread. We wait. For the bombing to calm. We crawl to him. We detach from his body the balls of bread. We take the canteens that are full. Some have been pierced by bullets. The bread is flabby. One just has to cut away the part touching his body. That's what we do all day. This has been going on for twenty-five days. For a long time, there are no more of these pantry-corpses. We eat whatever. I chew the strap of a water tank. Around the evening a buddy came with a rat. Once skinned, its flesh is white like paper. However, with my bit in hand, I still wait for the darkest part of the night to eat. We have an opportunity for tomorrow: a machinegun that was coming as reinforcement was pulped with its four servants twenty meters behind us. Later we will go pick up the haversacks of these four men. They came from the battery. They must have brought food for themselves. But we have to be careful not to let the ones on our right go there before us. They must be watching too from inside their hole. We watch. What matters is that the four of them are dead. They are. It's for the best. This has been going on for thirty days.

It's the great battle of Verdun. The whole world has its eyes riveted on us. We have terrible worries. Win? resist? hold? do our duty? No. Relieve ourselves. Outside, it's an iron storm. It's very simple, a shell of each caliber lands every minute on every square meter of land. We are nine survivors in a hole. It's not a shelter but the forty centimeters of dirt and logs above our head are in front of our eyes like an eyeshade against horror. Nothing in the world would make us go out of here anymore. But what we ate, what we eat, wakes up multiple times a day in our belly. We need to relieve ourselves. The first among us who couldn't contain himself anymore went out; for the last two days he has been there, three meters in front of us, dead pantless. We do in paper and we throw it there in front of us. We did in old letters we kept. We are nine in a space in which normally we would barely fit three tightly. We are somewhat tighter. Our legs and arms are tangled. Even when one wants to only bend his knee, we are all forced to move in a way that will allow him. The earth of our shelter shakes around us constantly. Relentlessly the gravel, the dust and the splinters blow in the side that is open to the outside. The one who is closest to this kind of door has his hands and his face flayed with thousands of small cuts. After some time we stop hearing the shells exploding; we only hear the loud hit when they land. It's an uninterrupted hammering. We have been there without moving for five days. Neither of us has any paper left. So we do in our haversacks and we throw them outside. One has to untangle his arms from other arms, remove his pants, and go in his haversack that is pressed against a friend's belly. When we are done we pass our dirty deed to the one in front of us, who passes it to the other who throws it outside. Seventh day. The battle of Verdun carries on. More and more heroic. We still don't leave our hole. We are only eight left. The one who was in front of the door has been killed by a large splinter that cut his throat and bled him to death. We tried to cover the door with his body. We were right to do so. A sort of grazing shot that has focused on our area for the last few hours makes splinter rain on us. We hear them hit the body blocking the door. Even though he was bled like a pig with his open carotid, he keeps bleeding with each wound he receives after his death. I forgot to say that for more than ten days none of us has had a rifle, nor ammunitions, nor knife, nor bayonet. But more and more, we have this terrible, never ending need, tearing at us. Particularly since we tried to swallow little balls of dirt to calm our hunger, and also because this night it rained and because we had not drunk for four days we also licked the rain water filtering through the logs and also the one coming from outside dripping along the corpse blocking the door. We go in our hand. It's a dysentery flowing through our fingers. We can't throw that outside. The ones in the back wipe their hands against the dirt near them, the three closest to the door wipe themselves against the dead's clothes. That's how we realize that we are doing blood. Thick blood, absolutely ruby colored. Beautiful. This one thought that it was the dead, against whom he wiped his hands, who was bleeding. But the beauty of the blood made him wonder.

The corpse has been blocking the door for four days and we are now August 9th, and we see well that it is rotting. This one had relieved himself in his righthand, so he passed his left hand against his rear; it came covered in fresh blood. During that day, we realize one by one that we are defecating blood. So we just do on the spot, there, under us. I said that we haven't got have weapons anymore, not for a long time; but we all have our cup passed in a belt because we are at all times consumed by a burning thirst and, once in a while, we drink our urine. It's the admirable battle of Verdun.

Two years later, in the Chemin des Dames, we would revolt (at this point I would be the only survivor of these last eight) for similar ignominies. Not at all for great motivations, not at all against the war, not at all to give peace to Earth, not at all due to great commandments, simply because we can't take going in our hand and drinking our urine anymore. Simply because deep in the army, the individual became filth.

The light and medium machine guns are a constant presence though. The USMC has replaced their belt fed models by taking all the infantry to full auto AR style mag fed rifles but the US Army has all of the belt feds still. But then we are expected to know every regular infantry task (except mortar employment), while the USMC only allows assault infantry to do this, anti-tank infantry to do that, then regular infantry, and vehicle crewman, and machine gun infantry all broken up into different and distinct jobs, never mixing or cross training, from what they’ve told me. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever stop being surprised how my 0311 USMC buddies don’t know machine guns, for instance. Many fired the 240 at Boot and never again.

I'm not neutral and I don't pretend to be one. 

Even if you're neutral, while reporting this war you have to look at both side of the conflict and while doing it you can clearly see that the amount of awful crimes hangs on Russian's side. By far. So even if neutral, there's no way you'll see this conflict as a 50-50 share of brutality. 

There's an aggressor and a victim. Only one side has civilians killed, raped and even abducted and cities bombed and then ALSO soldiers KIA. 

The other one has only soldiers KIA.

If this war had 2 countries fighting to gain a piece of territory of a third party, with only armies involved, then you would've had a balanced conflict and would've had been harder to take a side.

The term doesn't distinguish between guidance provided by human operation and guidance provided by an autonomous seeker, or any combination thereof.

SACLOS (semi-automatic command line of sight, crosshair-following or laser-following) missiles, like Starstreak, are less common against air targets because of the difficulty of tracking a flying target with the crosshair, but they do exist and some of them are even good (stares at Blowpipe). They're not used for air-to-air because trying to hold the crosshair on target while both the sensor platform _and_ the target are maneuvering is even less practical.

*Terminologically, an unguided missile is usually described as a rocket rather than a missile. ""Guided rockets"" do exist - the distinction is usually that a guided rocket has a short burn and only limited ability to correct its course, while a missile is continuously powered and can make complex maneuvers to track a target.

From June 6, 1944 through May 15, 1945 for US tank and tank destroyer losses in the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (Western Front): around 7,000 (including 4,399 M4 tanks, 178 M4 (105mm howitzer), 1,507 M3 Stuart tanks and 919 tank destroyers, of which 540 M10 tank destroyers, 217 M18 Hellcat and 152 M36 tank destroyers).

Losses of 5th Army (Sicily, Italy): 3,377 armored vehicles, including 1,171 M4s.  Several hundred tanks were lost in the Pacific Theater where they saw very limited action.  
  
The British had a slightly higher KIA rate (7%) in their tanks because they wore berets instead of helmets and, consequently, their crews suffered more fatal head trauma.

The Russians, in their T-34s, thanks to incredibly bad design, had a 75% casualty-rate and a vastly higher KIA rate to go with it.

Shrapnel from casings does often cause death but it is also common to die from descending ejected matter or shockwave effect. People regularly die without an overt mark from blast injuries such as blast brain, blast lung, blast belly. It is also common to be killed by falling detritus, especially in environments with shallow loose rock layers in surface soil (thats why a helmet is so important).

* Russia lost more tanks and men than in 10 years of Afghanistan;
* their entire chain of command proved to be shit and caused the death of who knows how many officers;
* they united almost all of Europe against Russia and forced them away from Russian gas (and hopefully, towards better nuclear programmes);
* they united NATO to the point it might start to be relevant again, to the point Finland and Sweden are thinking about joining;
* all of the world saw straight through their blatant propaganda and now everyone is looking at their war crimes (even those who deny them);
* They needed over 50 days to take a city that's one hour across the border, with the defending forces completely surrounded and impossible to resupply, and attacked via land, air and sea;
* They lost three major ships (two destroyed, one damaged and presumably retired) including their flagship - their attempt to cover up the sinking of the Moskva makes Russia look even more ridiculous that it is;
* The country defaulted on foreign debt;
* The industry, which already relied on foreign components and expertise, is stopping;
* They need to replace the US and EU markets with something else, quickly, while more and more of the world is distancing from them;
* Even if they conquer Crimea and the Donbass region, the sanctions will likely not stop due to the aggression, reported war crimes, and the threats towards other countries;

1065,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,,,,"It not that simple for Russia. I posted about this a week ago, so I'll repost most of what I said before. Some people found it helpful.

1. Equipment will be an issue: Russia still has huge logistics issues. Even since they pulled out from the North. Although better in the South, they are still having trouble supplying the men they already have in the field. You can't just hit the ""mobilize"" button and march your big army into Ukraine. They can't just shove a million men into an area where they are having trouble supporting 30K. You need food, shells, gas, clothes, showers, tents, sleeping bags, medicine, parts, tanks, IFVs, missiles, etc.. and you need trucks and trains to deliver it. You can't just throw meat at the problem or you'll have a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field. Russia is being caught with expired rations, stolen cars, 1950's medical equipment, guys rifles from the 1800's (a bit of an exaggeration, but not really), unencrypted radios, trees tied to trucks in improvised slat-armour, knock-off tires, non-functional ballistic vests, and Chinese knock-off motorcycles. Mobilization isn't going to fix the problem of being unable to equip and feed all those guys. 

2. Usefulness of all those troops is suspect: If Russia's army in Ukraine suffers from a lack of equipment (and trained operators of that equipment), not manpower, it isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around. Usually it is better to have your manpower trained as spares for when you own guys get killed than to train/equip a whole bunch of dudes and shove them into a battlefield all at once.  Russia doesn't need to ""mobilize"" to achieve that.  They can just get recruits by promising more money and properly train spares to keep the war going.  Mobilization isn't necessarily needed.

3. They might not be able to equip a large force due to bottlenecks in their military economy: While mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you need like I talked about in point #1. (and that is a more realistic thing that Russia needs) Serious analytical reports show that Russia is already trying to do that to the best of their ability. Unfortunately for Russia there are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion. Apparently they have also been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc..). They might be able to field an army armed with AK-74's, boots, and some Kevlar, but that's it. They're already having trouble equipping their current army with basics, trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. Also, Russia doesn't have a big economy. They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They might not have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip anything near what they need the next few months (by which time the war may already be decided.)   

4. Timeliness is problematic: You also need to train all these people or all you'd end up with is a bunch of conscripts with (likely) poor morale, training, etc.. who are a hinderance rather than a benefit. That takes time (months) and the war might be over by then. Russia is also performing poorly because their army fucking sucks at war. If they're already having trouble training recruits to a minimum standard, how is attempting something far larger going to be an automatic improvement? You might just end up with 500K useless bodies at a huge cost. You need to scale your goals to something achievable and useful.

5. The economy might be as big a problem as soldiers at the front: If you mobilize people for war and take them away from their normal jobs, you fuck over your economy and possibly make things worse in the long-term financially. You need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war.  Right now, Russia's central bank is preparing for a massive decline in the economy.  Possibly millions of new unemployed, hundreds if not thousands of businesses in trouble, and dozens of banks at risk of default (which will wipe out everyone's savings or drive up inflation if the central bank tries to bail them out).  Now is not the time to institute conscription unless you can figure out a way to do it without hurting yourself more than the enemy. It might be wiser to wait for the economic fallout to take place and then try to hire the unemployed to go to war. 

6. It might not be worth the cost given the alternatives: As you mentioned, conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan). People don't like being used as cannon fodder. It might cause people to revolt, which is worse for Putin than losing the war. Legally, they can't send guys into an offensive war (or at least that's what has been reported). Putin himself has said they will not send conscripts. When reports did emerge about conscripts being caught in Ukraine he made a bunch of pronouncements and called for them to be immediately removed. He even made a big show about it. This seems like a sensitive issue politically. I know he doesn't want to lose, but conscription might end up with him both losing AND being removed from power.  A bad peace deal is better than being dragged through the streets like Muammar Gaddafi. There are other options besides mobilization.  You can send out a massive advertising campaign and offer incentives (Russia is already doing this). You can activate semi-trained reserves. (Russia is already trying to do this but there have been some reports of issues).

7. It might be pointless already: Only Russia knows for sure: As mentioned in other points about equipment, while Russia might have an immediate manpower problem now, the bigger issue is likely a materiel problem. Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate. Planes, Tanks, IFVs, Supply Trucks, UAVs, Artillery, SPGs.  At some point, if Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose then, and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with old AK-74's getting mowed down by USA built Rocket Artillery.  Mobilization doesn't solve the materiel problem. 

9. There's also a sustainability/demographic issue as well:  Losing 3 or 4-to-1 against Ukraine (which might be their current loss rate) is unsustainable even in a long-term war. A win like that is just as damaging as a bad negotiated settlement.",dd443fe6efdff24cdf8308151bae8a864b272915,True,False,,,,,0,1650748486,,0,{},i5x8ytc,False,t3_u9ulpx,False,True,t1_i5wzs6o,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9ulpx/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_4232022/i5x8ytc/,1650748501,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650719686.0,[],text,t2_4mryd,False,True,

[Here is another source](http://characterisationexplosiveweapons.org/studies/final-report/)
If we go to ""BLAST EFFECTS ON THE HUMAN BODY"" we can read:
&gt;When blast waves remove limbs, the patient is unlikely to survive the loss of blood. In cases where the patient does survive such a traumatic amputation, the limbs can rarely be reattached.

If limbs are removed, we can be sure that a ""insudes turned to goo"" would apply, right? But people survive even that. Because their inside doesnt turn into goo.

&gt;Solid organs, such as the kidneys and liver, are not as susceptible to direct damage from blast waves as hollow organs, but the shear force imparted by blast waves can cause these to be torn from their attachment points within the body (Hernad, 2013).
The brain can be damaged by being suddenly accelerated and then decelerated. 

No goo. They get damaged, dislocated, but not turned into a liquid. As I discuss in the link there is no way for that to happen. How should the shockwave despoit so much energy inside the organ?

This is not true at all. The only exception is that Russia actually has modern land-based short-range AA systems like Pantsirs and Tors because the US has (for the most part) only mounted such systems on ships to protect them against incoming missiles.

Also Patriots and other Western AA systems don't have to be better than Russian AA systems to shoot down Russian cruise missiles like Kalibr and short-range [1] ballistic missiles like the Iskander.

So after that happened and the lines stabilized Canada and the US sent over trainers. So for like 7 to 8 years the West has been training them, and even those trainers have been impressed with how will the Ukrainians are able to fight. They'll be the first to say that their training can only do so much and that the Ukrainians themselves have all the credit to take for their success in this war.

Even so, for a large part of the training Canada and the US were focusing more on training. Basics, tactics, unit formations, unit movements, etc. Ukraine was asking for heavy weapons the whole time but the West seemed to be more interested in making sure they had a good foundation rather than just giving them fancy stuff.  That's why when this current part of the war started, and the West saw that they were able and willing to fight, heavier weapons started flowing in.

Now we're looking at the second phase and not only are we giving them squad level weapons we're giving them armor and some bad ass artillery.

1314,[],False,,jamison8884,,,,,,"""You think one of the largest weapon makers in the world can't make a few helicopters???""

Yes, that's exactly what I think. Russia relies on a lot of imports for their air equipment especially, since they don't have a very large commercial air sector in addition to military defense contractors. There's still quite a bit of communism, meaning government owned companies.

For example, Airbus and Boeing are two large aircraft manufacturers with extensive contracts, multiple locations/factories, and subcontractors to acquire custom parts and electronics. They just so happen to take on military contracts too.

Russia may be the second largest exporter of weapons worldwide, but no one claimed it's all state of the art weaponry. There's still a lot of older designs and older manufactured items being exported. For example, there's five Su-57's built, with an estimated date of 2025 to hit 76 produced (and that was the pre-war estimate). Meanwhile the US is manufacturing and exporting about 70 F-35's annually at the moment, and that's ramping up.

Then there's really large defense contractors like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin who are taking full advantage of a large economy, capitalism, and globalization. Even in the US though, if you cutoff imports from \~80% or more of the international economy, then they'd likely struggle to make additional high tech helicopters and jets too.",00a91b7826d3e549fb49fb08e0cae38147f342d0,True,False,,,,,0,1650746613,,0,{},i5x4wud,False,t3_u9z8sq,False,True,t1_i5uqj7t,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9z8sq/russian_ka52_attack_helicopters_attacking/i5x4wud/,1650746626,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650717813.0,[],text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,

\- I post only Russian footage, because I'm mad that combatfootage mostly shares Ukraine footage, so to ""balance things"", because, hey, as I said I'm neutral, I post only pro-russian stuff. 

\- If you look at my comment history you'll find that I'm either Russian or anyway I have friends or family members in Russia and as surprising as this could sound: they are pro-putin!

\- I say that both sides produce bullshit propaganda, but then I make fun of Ukraine propaganda while I keep posting news from pro-russian channels on Telegram. 

\- I'm prolly supporting any comment that shit on western countries. What about USA wars uh? 

*and someone answer that he was against USA too, because an aggressor remains an aggressor, it's over. No answers to that.* 

\- I write that I don't like Putin, but I've no problems to shit on Zelensky in the embarassing attempt to put both characters at the same level.

\- I was absolutely mad at videos of Russian pows tortured (and that's right). I say absolutely nothing about Russian massacre and brutal violence. 

""Eh, it's a war, shit happens pal. deal with it""

Now, these traits could be noticed in many users here or on worldnews and other subs, and I'm not talking about the obvious shills, whose intentions are clear, but I'm talking about those who are too afraid of downvotes (oh, the deadly downvotes!) to openly share their actual opinions about this war. 

I've personally called out some of them and asked other users to do the same.

They're convinced that since a war needs to see both sides, which is true, it's ok to talk as if both sides shares the same level of crimes and both countries are equally brutal.

One side is the aggressor that committed every type of war crime, the other is the one defending its territory. 

One is killing civilians and bombing cities, kidnapping hundres of ukrainians, the other one can only try to resist and push the aggressor out of the border. 

Maybe one day these ""neutral users"" will remember this period with shame, because they were supporting, in a way or another, the aggressor.

Overall, this is turning into a battle fought by artillery. This is evident by the fact that Ukraine has seized more working tanks than russia currently still has fielded, and they are not using them. Instead, they continue to push artillery forward and strategically use it. Russia is learning this truth as well, but lacks the training necessary to be fully effective. Russia is firing four times as much artillery, but inflicting a fraction of the casualties. The other side of this problem set are air strikes. While russia historically drops a significantly smaller number of precision munitions, the overall dumb bomb drops are effective simply because of russia's doctrine of carpeting an area to be effective. What few precision strikes they do perform are quite effective though. Overall, I still say russia is losing this battle. This is evident by the committed forces, leaked losses, munition expenditures, target selection, and seemingly strange troop movement (they pull troops from areas they should be holding and send them to areas where they 'claim' success, which indicates significant casualties and a desperate need to refresh the lines).

&amp;#x200B;

My overall prediction if UA can hold these lines and continue the current rate of battlefield friction... russia cracks just like in the north and needs to collapse their forces into areas of interest again. This will accelerate their losses and cause significant non-replaceable equipment loss. DNR forces continue to suffer significant losses and have no pool of fresh conscripts to pull from like russia. Vagner group is currently suffering as well. They cannot seem to fly troops to russia easily and Syria is currently no help either, as all Open Source monitoring seems to indicate 0 traffic through Iraq/Turkey into the Caspian Sea (they have no effective air corridor to transport large air lifts from Africa/Syria). Overall, russia is losing resources faster than it can replace them. Ukraine has tens of thousands of troops currently finishing up training on western tech, and western tech is flowing into Ukraine. Russia has expended 1600 cruise missiles of their approximate 2400 inventory (allocated for the invasion, the rest are for defense of the homeland or future operations). They fire Iskanders at the exact rate they produce them. Russia is at 75% combat effectiveness and UA is at about 90%. This is an overall losing battle that I see potentially collapsing russia.

&gt;Maybe if Ukraine took a stand and disbanded their Nazi battalion and didnt commit atrocities in eastern Ukraine like they have, they'd be in a better position to negotiate peace or get more public support. 

I could maybe agree to this on an optics/rhetoric level but i dont think it matters, if it wasnt this russia would be making up chemical biolabs weapons or whatever else. It's just another propaganda talking point.

They broke their Budapest Memorandum agreement to not use military force against ukraine. Any negotiation is really just a concession. They'll just break any agreement they dont like. 

The conflict is Russias fault, i wouldnt victim blame ukraine. I dont think azov was the difference in negotiation, nazis werent a serious part of negotiations because russia doesnt care about that, it's a thinly veiled propaganda talking point to label enemy bad.

Now, there does seem to be a nonsensical narrative going round that it hasn't begun yet, and that Russia is just launching probing attacks but that makes absolutely no sense, and is frankly pure pro-Russian copium.

Russia launches a massed artillery barrage but doesn't try and take advantage of it and instead decides to do nothing which allows Ukraine to repair damaged positions, why exactly?

And why exactly would you signal where you plan to launch a major offensive and give them time to reinforce by carrying out a small scale attack?  If you want to try and find weak points in Ukraine's defence in this day and age you'd use drones - note the high number of drones that have been shot down over the last few days.

Watch combat footage of most low flying aircraft (heli and fixed wing alike), they'll take their attack run, pop flares, egress out, rinse &amp; repeat.

Why? Modern missiles store a snapshot of the IR signature they originally lock on to. If there's MANPADS in the area, you do not want them locking on to *you*. So, when you're in range, you pop flares until you're out of range, circle back around, and do it again. These helis got too close to the MANPADS. Once they knew the MANPADS were in the area, they started popping flares (to prevent a lock) and attempted to egress, but they ran out of flares before they got out of range.

Evading MANPADS that already have a lock on you is a game of absolute luck. Pop flares, and aggressive maneuvering. At low alts put something between you and the launcher, like trees or terrain.

Afghanistan is the one for decades, but the Taliban and the terrorists they don't mind inhabiting their country are generally dicks. No one in the military prior to 2001 knew they would be deployed to either country. Anyone joining the military after 2003 knew they may be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, but likely wanted to fight the enemy in Afghanistan more than the ambiguous war in Iraq. However, Iraq changed into a security situation rather quickly, but then civil war broke out with the US being a variable within that war. ISIS later formed with origins in that civil war. The US soldiers/marines/airmen etc. absolutely did not want to have anything to do with Iraq other than to maintain a level of peace and security, and eliminate anyone looking to destroy infrastructure or kill civilians and the Iraq police/armed forces.

There is more evidence of war crimes and deliberate atrocities from Russia in that time period too. It's been about two months. The wars are quite different regardless of any other arguments.

Anyway, now that has been said, Russia has lost about 300% more KIA (and general casualties) than the US lost in both wars combined from 2001 to 2022 (a total of nearly 30 individual years of war if counted as one year per country over that time period). The US suffered 4,008 military KIA in the 30 years of accumulated war time. No one forced Russia to invade. Putin's excuse of ""NATO made me do it"" is complete and utter bullshit. Even as NATO is tempted to be drawn into a war, they're still resisting to enter, yet Putin wants people to believe that NATO's plan all this time was to invade Russia? Oh fuck off already with that logic. Even if that were the case, where the hell is the military build up required to do so? RU was on UA's borders building up forces for many months; NATO didn't do anything remotely like that.

If UA wanted to join NATO out of concerns for their country's safety next to Russia, it certainly appears their concerns were 100% justified. NATO is a defensive treaty, the whole purpose of Article 5 is to tell other militaries not to fuck with NATO or you're fucked. Putin is using this bullshit nazi and NATO argument to further the brainwashing of Russians. Even to this day, most Americans (at least) do not hate Russian civilians. We feel sorry for them, forced to live under Putin's evil thumb and continue to be brainwashed towards hatred and violence of the west. Without Putin and without hatred, the west would have gladly accepted a flourishing Russia. Putin, in all of his infinite wisdom, has actually made NATO closer and stronger than any time in its history. Finland and Sweden will join, and hopefully Ukraine will win the war and then join too. Combine NATO, NATO allies in the middle east, along with NATO allies in the far east, and Russia/China have no shot at violently progressing their agenda.",452c5dbcc89340fc26533ce784bf11c11a12c1f6,True,False,,,,,0,1650743305,,0,{},i5wxkra,False,t3_ua3oac,False,True,t1_i5wcp9o,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ua3oac/full_version_of_the_drone_video_showing_the/i5wxkra/,1650743319,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650714505.0,[],text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,

The point is, nowhere in the world do actual 4th Reich Nazis have the power that they do in Azov, and they brazenly and openly share it with you, but you choose to ignore it because some talking head on TV tells you it isnt a big deal. 

You cant hate nazis and then be okay with arming people that use swastikas on their armor. Those icons mean something. Everyone knows what they mean. 

Also, one of the main methods RU used to stop Azov from fleeing Mariupol is to check civilians for tattoos. They caught a lot of people w/ nazi body tattoos wearing civilians cloths trying to leave. 

&gt;That was Russia supporting separatists groups. That conflict is what was terroziing eastern ukraine and now russia is openly terrorizing all of ukraine

The point is the new western favored government after the coup was willing to use nazi units to terrorize eastern ukraine. I hold my side to a higher standard, since Im trying to take the moral highground, right? Also, doesnt violence beget violence? Maybe if Ukraine took a stand and disbanded their Nazi battalion and didnt commit atrocities in eastern Ukraine like they have, they'd be in a better position to negotiate peace or get more public support. 

Instead, Im not stuck w/ my TV telling me to keep giving guns to Nazis. Like... no. We shouldnt have armed Al Qaeda when we did, cartles when we did, or nazis when we did. 

If we all did this how you want, its just tribal warfare, constant back and forth. If we are good guys we shouldnt be doing this. But hey, we also invaded Iraq over fake WMDs so its probably clear by this point there are no good guys. 

&gt;And ukraine doesnt want to be invaded by Russia, too bad? Hope they eat shit for it.

Yeah, if they cant find peaceful terms, I dont want to be involved in any wars that put my country and fellow citizens at risk. As it is, most of the middle east and africa are slave-ridden shitholes that commit far worse atrocities on a daily basis and my governemnt doesnt give a single flying fuck and if anything actively makes it worse. I see no reason to suddenly dive into WW3 for one particular country.

No need to be skeptical, the science behind it is pretty public. Early and some cheap missiles take the best IR signature, call it good, and track it. That's why you have instances of early AIM-9s going ""Ooh, the sun, that looks like something to go get!"" As tech evolved, filters were put in place to get rid of superfluous info, and modern missiles actually have a computer that stores the IR signature they originally got a lock on, and filter based on that.

Pilots of all kinds must be extremely valuable in Russia given the level of training required and their lack of funds to pay for it, especially given the new sanctions. Helicopters and jets are also extremely valuable (pilots being more valuable in my opinion) given their reliance on some parts imported from other countries and slow or non-existent assembly lines. They've lost in excess of \~115 jets and helicopters each as is, and they are likely further from gaining air supremacy given the import of both anti-air systems and MANPADS from NATO since the invasion began.

Flares are limited, and this dude even set it to release 3 at a time per side. There aren't enough flares on that thing to ripple them off as he was that entire video. It just seems the RU tactics are inefficient and wasteful? It appears their sorties are tickling out versus one big operation to try and clear an area of at least their AA launchers/vehicles (I know MANPADS are small targets nearly impossible to detect until they fire)?

If I had to guess, the US would run SEAD missions with a large number of jets per operation, with specific aircraft equipped with the best available jammers, sensors, and anti-radiation missiles to try and focus their efforts specifically on anti-air while other forces would assist in hitting the source of the AA fire in support? Would most air forces/armies even deploy such old helicopter platforms with this level of AA threat? If the helicopters aren't flying out of line of sight, then it appears I'm correct in assuming they're big turkeys asking to be hit. **I don't know, so that's why I'd love some education on the RU tactics we've witnessed.**",8bc789b8c8c48dc691cbff3b26841a8903b19c90,True,True,,,,,0,1650741502,,0,{},i5wto6y,False,t3_ua3oac,False,True,t3_ua3oac,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ua3oac/full_version_of_the_drone_video_showing_the/i5wto6y/,1650741517,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650712702.0,[],text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,

of course, and some of my other comments on here specifically point out holodomor 

holodomor happened before WW2, and then in WW2 concentration camps were here

there is a lot of back and forth in the region, east v west

&gt;Russias atrocities were actually pretty equal to that of nazi germany

They were likely worse

&gt;I can't in honesty say i blame some ukranians for naively assuming nazis would be liberators at the time

Youre actually correct here, lol, but the country is larger than this and modernly the east v west territory cover different areas where Azov is now being used in the east to do unsavory things. 

&gt;I guess it's just weird and kinda cringe you focus so much on a nazi patch worn by a very minority group of people but not focus on the more nazi-like actions of Russia invading Ukraine

There is an entire batallion that has the Wolfsangel flag in its logos and then in the background the Nazi blacksun. Like what. in. the. fuck. I have heard nothing but how bad nazis are for the last 10 years and now suddenly my tax dollars are buying guns for people that wear swastikas. 

Can you understand by hesitation here? Like I get it, the media is all lies and they gaslight me all the time but this red flag is just too big for me. It doesnt matter if the unit is ""small."" **Its an official unit of the country**. No other country openly uses Nazi Battalions. Its the strongest Nazi power center on the planet. Remnants that believe in the 4th Reich, and my government is arming and funding them. 

Its not the first time the USA did this. We have long armed cartels, al qaeda, terror groups, you name it. We have a 60 year history of propping up dictators and then blowing them up for the profit of defense contractors. Its not surprising to me that we are arming Nazis, but still, its just so hard to accept because for so long they've told me nazis are bad as they libeled and slandered anti-establishment politicians as ""nazis.""

&gt;nazi-like actions of Russia invading Ukraine

Invading a country is not nazi-like. All of humanity for all of recorded history has invaded outer country. In actuality, Russia has more of a reason to invade Ukraine than we did Iraq lmao. Like, Iraq had no WMDs. Why the fuck were we there killing all those people? Russia can at least point out that we are toppling regimes in Ukraine in 2014, trying to get them into NATO, and putting weapons right on their border. Kind of like the Cuban missile crisis against America. 

&gt; harm than azov battalion ever would and people acting like 10 people wearing a nazi patch is reason to invade a country

10? It is literally their official logo that all of them wear, whether theyre a nazi or not. 

&gt;Nazis werent the primary talk of negotiations. It's imperial conquest and labeling any opposition as nazis works on people like you

Imperial conquest, like the western governments have long done? Of course it is this. Its all about power, resources, money. Just like how the west cares more about politician's kids making $$$ on Ukrainian goas boards than they do any actual civilians. Of course its just a proxy war dude. And unlike America, when Russia says theyre gonna kill some Nazis, they actually are. Notice how Azov dug into Mariupol and that is where almost all of the fighting is actually happening. We never did find those WMDs. Poor Iraq. 

In actuality though, the conflict for Russia is just about creating a buffer with the west. Take over eastern ukraine and keep it at least neutral. Our politicians have been poking the bear for a long time. [Like here is Lindsey Graham and McCain talking about taking the fight into Russia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeWHviwLMy8).

The Azov logo is a SS Panzer division logo and their troops walk around w/ swastikas, deaths head, and black sun patches on their armor. Ukraine was the site of some WW2 concentration camps after being victim of Soviet Holodomor genocide. 

It is a very divided and split country east v west. The Azov group was used to keep east in check and commit atrocities in the east. 

I loaded up the video you linked and one of the first things it tries to tell me is that Zelensky is Jewish. That doesnt mean shit. Zelensky was an actor picked for the job after he used to do skits where he played pianos with his genitals. 

CNN tells me Candace Ownes (black) is a white supremacist. Its a long established precedent that your race doesnt matter for this kind of stuff. There were also numerous Jews in WW2 that did things for Nazis, whether it be out of safety, for money, whatever. This idea that ""because he is ethnically Jewish"" he cant go along with arming and funding Azov battalions is pointless. In the end, the people deciding to arm and fun Azov are likely above Zelensky and its not even his decision to make. 

Also, as theyre talking about the Wolfsangel logo, they ignore the Nazi black sun in the background of the logo. Lmao WHAT THE FUCK. 

WAKE UP MAN. The media is literally showing you Nazis and being like ""ignore everything we have told you for the last 10 years to hate nazis, these ones are good nazis!""",67d247792018d63240d105ac27283ef8a4e6795b,True,False,,,,,0,1650739492,,0,{},i5wp8qa,False,t3_u9zet9,False,True,t1_i5uw9ja,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9zet9/urban_fighting_in_mariupol_near_the_azovstal/i5wp8qa/,1650739509,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650710692.0,[],text,t2_ysyoa,False,False,

Like we have la raza, cartels, al qaeda, etc. Nazis are one of the most powerless ideologies in America. 99.99% of the time you hear someone called a nazi, it is just libel and slander to justify violence and chill the speech of people that disagree with big corporations and big federal government. 

We have no Army Battalions using Nazi logos in America. Ukraine, but contrast, **does**. Remember, Ukraine is a very divided country east v west. Look at language spoken and voting patterns. Ukraine went from being victim to Soviet Holodomor genocide to having Nazi concentration camps in WW2. It has a long history of back and forth corruption. 

Do you think in America anyone could get away with that? Why can they in Ukraine? Why do I see Azov Battalion logos all over the place, when its literally a Panzer Division logo? It should be a huge red flag to you dude. They **arm and fund** units that openly wave Nazi flags. What. In. The. Fuck. 

The western side used these azov groups to commit atrocities in eastern Ukraine. Notice how Russia is mostly focusing on eastern Ukraine. Notice how much of their effort is in Mariupol, where Azov dug in. No one claimed that ""every Ukrainian is a nazi."" No. But, ukraine is the only place on the planet openly using Nazi military units. 

&gt;The president is jewish

CNN tells me that Candace Owns is a white supremacist. A person's race means nothing, apparently, so why does it here? The president was an actor doing skits about playing pianos with his genitals before he was selected to replace the last person in office. He is there to look sad and tell what his handlers want him to, and being an actor was a perfect prereq for his role. Plenty of times in the 20th century there have also been Jews that worked with nazis, whether it be for their own safety, for money, whatever. Just like how tons of blacks are called white supremacists in America when they break from the hivemind, its possible to be a ""race"" that does things bad for your race. Why would Jews be any exception to this? Additionally Nazism at its core isnt anti-Jew *gasp* its a totalitarian ideology and those types of ideologies have to always divide. In Germany in the 1930s, Jews were the convenient target, especially with many of the communists being Jews. Note, Nazis and Antifa (many Jews!) used to work together to kill cops of the Weimar republic. There wasnt some foundational anti-Jew aspect to being a Nazi, it developed over time to divide and conquer. They needed a scapegoat, a group to target. Just like communists play with religion and class divisions, its Tyrant 101 dude. 

I spent a few good years really interested in WW2 history and I always found it so interesting how modernly its just totally distilled down to very rudimentary tenants that dont actually reflect how it came to be and why Nazis did what they did. And how other powers like Japan, which was objectively worse than the Nazis (Japan was the other Axis power, genocided china, korea, and the pacific islands, had Unit 731 human experiments, mass murdered all POWs, used bombs on babies, etc) but somehow theyre atrocities are completely memory holed by the mainstream.",282742666ac9a409c46d365e6b34e81f444f5114,True,False,,,,,0,1650738992,,0,{},i5wo4cu,False,t3_u9zet9,False,True,t1_i5uwjme,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9zet9/urban_fighting_in_mariupol_near_the_azovstal/i5wo4cu/,1650739007,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650710192.0,[],text,t2_ysyoa,False,False,

Look up voting patterns and even language patterns in the country. Very split east v west. In 2014, the west supported a regime change and coup in the country. Ever since, weve been pushing for NATO status and putting weapons on RU's border.

I legitimately, 100% believe that no European or Asian power can conquer Ukraine. Not China, not France, not Germany, not India. I also think that the only country that stands a chance of doing that is the US - and even they would take an absolute pounding and have whole units / elite units more or less turned to paste if they attacked via the same frontline that Russia did, so a costly victory at best that would make whichever political party started such a war - lose for the next 10-15 years.

I also didnt believe Russia would start this war simply because... 200 000 soldiers attacking a DEFENDER with high morale and 250K+ soldiers before mobilization...

Seems insane to me. Honestly.

Are you saying dogs are such primitive creatures they have no intent, only instincts? People often operate on instinct too. Dogs are also capable of thought. 

&gt;Don’t forget that we are animals too and we can be “extremely vicious” and you go to work and do things “for food” so don’t fool yourself you are more important because you can use the toilet

oh okay so now we are all on the same term as dogs, take a position man

&gt;They shit everything and don’t bath”. I can see clearly you are not a parent and you haven’t potty trained a human for few years. Dog poo is nothing

Unless I am in Los Angeles or San Francisco, people dont poo in the streets. Dogs do. Even a trained dog still just runs outside and drops a big shit right on your lawn and doesnt care. At least cats have the decency to bury it lmao. 

&gt;Every negative aspect you have mentioned about dogs can be attributed to humans plus humans do it deliberately

Completely false. We as humans domesticated dogs and **actually** their good traits are FROM humans. Leave a dog in the wild and it will be nothing but a vicious animal. We domesticated them and train them to act properly. 

I do pity your life that you reached some point to thinking a dog is more special than humans. Its a dumb fucking dog. Many are lovable wonderful creatures that we have tamed into making the world a better place, but they as a species dont even come close to other humans. The fact that bad people exist out there has no bearing on this analysis.

&gt; French foreign intelligence agents are reported to have been mistaken for thieves during a secret training mission in Bulgaria.

&gt; The embarrassing incident saw five French citizens set upon by local residents.

&gt; Several respected French websites said two of the agents were shot in the leg and a third received a broken nose.

&gt; Neither country has confirmed claims that the group were spies. 

&gt; ""Everything has been handled correctly by investigators and after we sent our questions, the French embassy confirmed the identity of the people who had been detained in the village. They were then handed over to the French side and they are not wanted for any crimes in Bulgaria,"" Tsevtan Tsevtanov, Bulgaria's Interior Minister, said.

&gt; The five insisted they were extreme sports enthusiasts who were on holiday in the Bulgarian village, close to the city of Pleven.

&gt; The incident happened in the middle of October and has only come to light now that the group has returned to France.",c1afb7354e8664cc1fb433d6d109a7a81b5e6ef1,True,False,,,,,0,1650737114,,0,{},i5wjvap,False,t3_uaadyt,False,True,t1_i5wg2um,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uaadyt/chinese_jet_fighter_crash_can_anyone_recognize/i5wjvap/,1650737125,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650708314.0,[],text,t2_byhrh,False,False,

2382,[],False,,thismath7,,,,,,"&gt; 60% statistic out of your ass but Reddit has always been libertarian along left and right lines, that’s not the same as “conservative

it was more than half, and populist/freethinking/libertarian ideologies went hard to the conservative side in the last 4-6 years because of how blatant the ""left"" has embraced big corporations and big government. A lot of people voted for Trump simply because he called out the government's bullshit. People are tired of having their rights pruned, Constitution ignored, rule of law disgraced, science ignored (50 genders) you name it. Lately the whole grooming and going after children is a huge red line for a lot of people too. 

Unless youre fully invested in the corporate media narrative, you basically had no other choice than Trump for a while. Doesnt mean he is the right guy, or was right about everything, or that he isnt even secretly friends with joe and everyone behind the scenes, as he did used to hang out with these people and they used to love him. 

But when you watch things like the charity dinner with hillary, where trump just roasted her, you can at least have some hope he believed what he said. And when you go back to his interviews in the 90s and 80s, he has been consistent the whole time. One of the few politicians that hasnt flip flopped on major issues. Like even obama said marriage was between a man and a woman before his ""election"" but Trump as far back as the 90s was saying it was like steak preference, everyone has their own (lol at the steak analogy). 

If youre libertarian there is no room for you in the modern DNC or the establishment GOP. Their views run almost 100% contrary to everything a libertarian believes in.

&gt;And you’re doing Aaron Swartz a massive disservice by implying he got epsteined or some shit with quotes around suicide

This has happened to many people. There is a reason that hillary is called Killary. The most dangerous profession in the world is being around the clintons. Not even roofers or fisherman get fatality ratios close. 

Considering Aaron Swartz politics and position, and the FBI's recent track record of hunting down political dissidents while totally ignoring horrendous crimes that serve their agendas, going after journalists, harassing political opponents, etc, its totally possible that their targeting of Aaron Swartz was connected with his death. 

heck even Jussie Smollet when he was sentenced for his hate crime hoax (because the demand for racism is higher than the supply) was shouting he isnt suicidal. Well, when he faked his lynching he was working w/ Kamala Harris and Cory Booker on a ""anti-lynching bill"" (as if lynching isnt already illegal). Is there a connection? Maybe. Its easy to speculate but when patterns like this arise, Jussie probably knows something I dont. Why else would he be shouting that he wasnt suicidal when his sentence was **substantially** less than what he deserved for intentionally trying to put innocents people in prison and start race riots where people often die?

&gt;The government ruined his life over nothing and he was facing most of his life in jail along with millions in fines, they didn’t need to kill him

Aaron's personality didnt lend to giving up so easily. Also, iny our own message, check yourself. **""Ruined his life over nothing**"". Exactly. Fuck the traitors at the FBI. Doubt they'd try to ruin the life of a good little sycophants doing the establishment's dirty work. 

&gt;takes away from focusing on why multiple government branches conspired to throw the book at him for something so innocuous

They do this to anyone that doesnt fall in line. The FBI is a crime organization. At least those Whitmer ""kidnappers"" seem to be going free because the jury nullified the case. The FBI is too involved with entrapping people to solve any actual crime. They seem to always know the terrorists in America but never stop the crime.

5.  Russia is sanctioned to high hell, they've burned through all their reserves that aren't seized, and they're going to have millions unemployed in the coming months.

Also, no one “lined up in a big old line” in WW1 or even 10 years earlier during the Russo Japanese war.

It’s crazy how people here are using talking points about modern combat from 1960.

Here:

&gt; Forests, jungles, and buildings, moreover, are opaque to both air and ground
observers and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Current radar,
infrared, and optical sensors are all blocked by foliage or masonry.18 Electronic
emissions from forests and towns can be sensed, but this rarely allows targeting
more than just the emitter itself.19 New low-frequency wideband radars may
eventually penetrate foliage, but this program is in its early stages. If the technology proves feasible, countermeasure-resistant, and practical, a fielded military
system could still be a generation away.20 Remotely delivered unattended ground
sensors might detect targets in forests or towns but have limited ranges and must
be used in quantity for extensive coverage. For the foreseeable future, cost will
restrict them to use in limited areas.21 In theory, small special forces teams can
infiltrate into sight of targets in forests or towns and then radio coordinates to
aircraft for attack, but not if their targets prevent them from penetrating into
such close proximity. A proper modern-system defense with interlocking fields
of fire from concealed firing positions, an outpost zone oriented to defeating infiltration, and substantial depth, for example, would prove difficult to destroy in
this way. A workable target acquisition system, moreover, would need an effective munition to threaten targets in wooded or built-up areas; foliage-penetrating
terminal guidance could well prove more challenging than surveillance, while urban areas pose difficult masking problems for weapons descending on normal
trajectories.22

…

&gt; The third factor retarding air effectiveness against modern-system targets is
the interaction between cover and technical countermeasures. Better sensors
and weapons spur development of countermeasures. These include decoys, obscurants, jamming, spoofing, hardening, signature suppression, and active defenses, inter alia. All have long been deployed to protect high-value air and naval
targets, and all are now being applied to protect ground-force targets like
tanks and armored personnel carriers against precision-guided air and missile delivered weapons.37 Massed, moving tank columns in the open, however, present multiple signatures and are thus exposed to such a wide range of seeker
types that it will be nearly impossible to spoof or suppress or obscure them all simultaneously and continuously. By restricting the variety and degrading the effectiveness of hostile sensors, however, cover, concealment, and dispersion
greatly ease the countermeasures’ task. In the open, seeker technology has been
winning the detection/counterdetection race, in large measure due to the effectiveness of multispectral sensing and data fusion techniques in thwarting countermeasures implemented singly.38 In cover, the reduced variety and strength of
signatures make it possible for feasible technical countermeasures to gain the
upper hand. Moreover, routine use of natural cover enables ground forces to
focus countermeasure use on temporary protection during brief periods of unavoidable exposure. Expendable obscurants like exothermic chaff or multispectral smokes, for example, are potentially very effective across a range of frequency bands, but continuous expenditure poses impossible logistical
demands.39 Militaries able to exploit natural cover to limit their exposure to brief
windows can make such expendable countermeasures tactically feasible. Similarly, modern-system cover enables decoy and jammer use to focus on key times
and places rather than being diffused across entire battlefields and entire armies.
In effect, technical countermeasures thus work like suppressive fires: they do not
permanently defeat hostile shooters (or seekers); rather, they temporarily shield
modern-system subunits during brief sprints from cover to cover.40

From “Military Power” by Biddle, pages 55-58

Not one single army that has fought since 1918 doesn’t routinely use cover, concealment, and dispersal. There are no Napoleonic tank battle lines as you are imagining. These practices make acquiring individual targets difficult and increase the strength of countermeasures to drones such as supporting infantry with MANPADs, EW, and SHORAD. However bad being in a tank seems, remember that it often costs hundreds of thousands to destroy a tank and a $0.10 bullet is all it takes to destroy you.",1a61c858aac3371777f7c0723786ea4c35dc20be,True,False,,,,,0,1650734979,,0,{},i5wezgi,False,t3_ua1dvh,False,True,t1_i5vw5r0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ua1dvh/the_russians_use_the_tactics_of_tank_carousel/i5wezgi/,1650734994,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650706179.0,[],text,t2_z0ms5,False,False,

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometres_per_hour) has this to say:

&gt;The kilometre per hour (SI symbol: km/h; abbreviations: kph, kmph, km/hr) is a unit of speed

According to the [Collins English dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/kph):

&gt;kph is written after a number to indicate the speed of something such as a vehicle. kph is an abbreviation for 'kilometers per hour.' 

According to the [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/kph):

&gt;kph: abbreviation for kilometers per hour

According to the [Reuters style guide](https://www.trust.org/contentAsset/raw-data/652966ab-c90b-4252-b4a5-db8ed1d438ce/file)

&gt;Use km per hour on first reference, kph on subsequent references.

According to the [Economist Style Guide](http://www.benjaminjameswaddell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/the-economist-style-guide.pdf):

&gt;Abbreviate kilograms to kg, kilometres per hour to kph, kilometres to kg, miles per hour to mph

Now, I'm sure other style guide use different things, but I think it's fair to say that kph is recognized by many sources as standing for kilometers per hour.

Why would we domesticate a dog for food before we invented agriculture? Makes no sense, and there’s no evidence for it. They were domesticated as companion animals and for protection. Just because dogs are eaten in the West in the most dire of emergency hunger situations doesn’t mean they are ‘eaten in Europe’. There is everything special about dogs as a species: there is no another species like them, and none closer to us. It’s obvious that you either just don’t like dogs, think that other culture should be allowed to do whatever they want just because it’s their culture (no thanks, genitalia multinationals is bad.

Other reasons is Ukraine throw too much propaganda that is insulting my brain and that really made me difficult to sympathize towards them.
I do know that Russian also come out with their own propaganda but their propaganda is much much much better, like releasing combat footage or bragging that their new missile could reach the US and the US won’t be able to stop it, well in this case the US probably can or probably they can’t, we’ll never know for sure without seeing it in action for real and that in my book doesn’t make their claim false until proven otherwise.

Lastly I believe that the US have their agenda with this war because they keep escalating and I thought Ukrainian is stupid to let their homeland made into warzone between east and west.

&gt; And sure it might be “none of my business” if people explicitly care more about a dog more than people

Yep I'm sure.


&gt; but do you really have any business in calling people nazi’s just because they disagree with you?

False. The disagreement doesn't bother me. The issue is that some people are trying to tell others what they should think, feel and say. The thread started with this gem (hopefully not taken out of context, you'll agree): ""everyone’s freaking out because a dog died"". 

1. Yep, they're allowed to freak out. Who are you to say they are not? They are allowed to care about the dogs and not the humans. It might suck for you, but it would be good  to be a grown-up and deal with it.
For example, I care about both animals and humans, but I have to deal with it when someone says they care more about human lives than animal lives. I don't tell you ""why do you care so much about the humans and not the animals"", so why do you do it?

2. This type of rhetoric (""humans lives matter more than animal lives"") is spread by self-important assholes busy licking their own genitals in blissful admiration of their useless selves. Their superiority complex makes them think they are God's gift to the universe when in fact they're just walking sacks of excrement who will sooner or later be just as dead as anything else. They are literally meat, laughing at other meat: ""oh look, we're superior"". There's nothing particularly admirable in that. Also, this superiority complex is nothing new. It has brought us such amazing displays of human empathy like the Holocaust. Because some people think they're superior.


&gt; Also why did you just pick and choose for things to respond in my comment instead that can be taken out of context and berated instead of responding to the whole comment at the best of your ability like I’m doing to you?


1. People on reddit have short attention spans. I reply to specific things so that they remember what they wrote in the first place.

2. I did respond to your whole comment, there wasn't much to it. What exactly is there that can be taken out of context?

Such dishonesty and backtracking.

You specifically claimed that this article supported your claim - that is why we were focusing on it.

If you were a more honest person less prone to rationalization, it could be interesting to discuss the merits of the other articles, but frankly I do not see any hope in something fruitful coming from talking to you.

While you also made other claims, you claimed that the UK MOD article in particular supported your extreme claim. The fact that you try to move on to other articles now seems to indicate that you recognize your failure.

The new quotes also do not support the extreme statements you made but I won't bother with them.

To conclude the conversation and your dishonesty,

The claim you were defending - and which was needed to make the rationalization that the UK is talking horseshit - was that officials claimed that Russia at large was running out of food and ammunition, long term, full stop.

What the article actually said was,

""logistic problems [prevent] Russia from effectively resupplying forward troops"".

So, we have concluded that your claim was not backed up, it was a rationalization on your part, what the UK MOD said made sense and is not inconsistent with what we are saying today, and if we want to claim that someone is full of horseshit, I'd point to someone else here rather than the UK MOD.",7e9dfd15afe5ef41005a7091b77cf86359040d44,True,False,,,,,0,1650725510,,0,{},i5vtixu,False,t3_u9huxc,False,True,t1_i5vrulb,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9huxc/russian_spetsnaz_in_a_night_time_attack_on_a/i5vtixu/,1650725521,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650696710.0,[],text,t2_13tly4,False,False,

&gt;What the article actually said was,

&gt;""logistic problems [prevent] Russia from effectively resupplying forward troops"".

&gt;That statement of theirs makes sense and it is not in conflict with the Eastern front today not being out of food.

Are you actually trying to claim that I only posted one article? 

&gt;Incorrect. If you make a claim, it is on you to back it up. If your justification is that you dishonestly misinterpret what people say, the failure is yours. To boot, it is obvious to see what they mean, you are four rationalizations away from it saying what you want it to, and no intelligent person would make such a ridiculous misinterpretation.

&gt;So, we have concluded that your claim was not backed up, it was a rationalization on your part, what the UK MOD said made sense and is not inconsistent with what we are saying today, and if we want to claim that someone is full of horseshit, I'd point to someone else here rather than the UK MOD.

Oh yeah earlier you asked me where Ukraine had made claims about Russia running out of food or weaponry - 

&gt;And intelligence suggests Russia's forces now only have enough food for another three days.

It said in a statement: ""According to the available information, Russian occupation forces operating on the territory of Ukraine have ammunition and food supplies for no more than three days.

""The situation is similar with fuel, which is replenished by tank trucks. The occupiers were unable to organize a pipeline to meet the needs of the grouping of troops.""

Incorrect. The claim you were defending - and which was needed to make the rationalization that the UK is talking horseshit - was that officials claimed that Russia at large was running out of food and ammunition, long term, full stop.

What the article actually said was,

""logistic problems [prevent] Russia from effectively resupplying forward troops"" with ""Russia is running out of stuff full stop.""

That statement of theirs makes sense and it is not in conflict with the Eastern front today not being out of food.

&gt; They need to be more precise and accurate with their assessments then. That's not my job it's theirs.

Incorrect. If you make a claim, it is on you to back it up. If your justification is that you dishonestly misinterpret what people say, the failure is yours. It is not one that intelligent people would not make.

So, we have concluded that your claim was not backed up, it was a rationalization on your part, what the UK MOD said made sense and is not inconsistent with what we are saying today, and if we want to claim that someone is full of horseshit, I'd point to someone else here rather than the UK MOD.",afc45b576217786ed0fd52b58b647bc6b48ff911,True,False,,,,,0,1650723959,,0,{},i5vq590,False,t3_u9huxc,False,False,t1_i5vmket,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9huxc/russian_spetsnaz_in_a_night_time_attack_on_a/i5vq590/,1650723975,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650695159.0,[],text,t2_13tly4,False,False,

The example in OP is a perfect example of the little relevancy tanks have left. Ie, small amounts of time, providing direct fire support to infantry assaults, where the tank moves from a covered and concealed position, to a firing point and repositioning immediately. 

On major maneuvers, when we were often restricted to fighting the other US units with Soviet doctrine and equipment, our entire unit was built around that purpose. When I was there we held our own and would even destroy entire armored battalions in hours. Left to our own devices, we’d developed techniques that were even more lethal. Tanks die. Massed formations of all types, they die. On the modern battlefield, dispersion is the main defense followed closely by highly controlled exposure windows. The tank’s armor is a joke and not a credible defense. Soviet/Russian and everyone’s APSs have not shown themselves to be ready for the modern fight and vehicles of all types are not equipped with a credible defense. The Jav has been capable of such for decades and has demonstrated the same for 19 years. 1) most people seemed not to notice the fights it participated in and 2) most people seem not to have learned the lessons of those fights, such that they are amazed at what we are seeing today. 

I’m amazed that the West has been able to move large stocks of modern ATGMs and other AT systems to the front unmolested, far more than I’m amazed that the Jav works. We knew that already. We expected that long ago. 

OP demonstrates that ‘combat trains soldiers’ and that every group has someone that will buck the old ways and find what works; and will use it. You find the fights you can win and you fight only those. It’s the lesson the Red Barron espoused. It’s a lesson that this TC has learned the hard way and is seeing to their own combat effectiveness and continued survival in the best way possible.",e1cd91ba4bf9b209d19b69cf0b7de001d38de889,True,False,,,,,0,1650723544,,0,{},i5vp8th,False,t3_ua1dvh,False,True,t1_i5vmcsm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ua1dvh/the_russians_use_the_tactics_of_tank_carousel/i5vp8th/,1650723556,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650694744.0,[],text,t2_51tfe949,False,False,

In January 2021, a leghty and carefully research article appeared that claimed a member of Avoz, a (Belarusian-Ukrainian Nazi Sergei Korotkikh)[Sergei Korotkikh](https://uk-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%96%D0%B9_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) (nicknames: Malyuta, Boatswain or Boatsman, Zakhar Lavrentyev, etc., born 1974) was [in fact a Russian agent](https://zaborona.com/en/the-national-policy-institute-has-compiled-a-dossier-accusing-sergei-korotkikh-of-working-for-russian-intelligence-services-the-dossiers-author-was-later-assaulted/).

In a plot twist in August 2021, Russian authorities [laid charges](https://novayagazeta-ru.translate.goog/articles/2021/08/24/sk-rf-prediavil-obvineniia-v-ubiistvakh-neonatsistu-soratniku-tesaka-i-eks-boitsu-azova-sergeiu-maliute-korotkikh-news?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) on Korotkikh accusing him of participating in the 2007 beheadings.

The reason why pro-Rsssians now mention Boatswain / Boatsmam a lot is that Korotkikh is the founder and leader of the Boatsman group of Fighters, and he used a drone to film Bucha while it was under Russian control.

The footage was shown by Korotkikh himself to reporters, it showed bodies of civilians on Yablonska street while Russia troops and vehicles were nearby, disproving the original Kremlin claim, that they were killed by Ukrainians after Russians left as a false flag. The Kremlin didn't miss a step, after the footage was shown, they accused Sergei ""Boatsman"" Korotkikh himself of killing the civilians.",e7cd30b2808ea4fd18cb40a8176507645eeeb5c9,True,False,,,,,0,1650723082,,0,{},i5voad3,False,t3_ua3bz3,False,True,t1_i5v8x6k,/r/CombatFootage/comments/ua3bz3/ukrainian_infantry_push_russians_out_of_a_farm/i5voad3/,1650723094,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650694282.0,[],text,t2_bpwyg,False,False,

3849,[],False,,TheAnalyticalFailure,,,,,,"Anybody with sense and a wide range of sources can see Russia is winning because they are achieving military objectives and locking Ukraine in place.  There are no reinforcements coming from Kiev to the East.  Mariupol was a key city, the only one Russia has truly fought hard over, because it is one of the only places that matters strategically.  

The war is going to unfold in the East over the next few weeks and it will become undeniable that Ukraine is taking massive losses.  Once the army in the East is destroyed, Russia will have options on how to proceed, and if they do proceed, it is very likely they take Odessa next, or simply push to the Dnipro river, perhaps even both. 

&amp;#x200B;

The goals of Russia are straight forward and are being achieved, even if it is at a pace slower than one would expect (though many people underestimated the UA military capability and will to fight including the Russians.)  

&amp;#x200B;

1 Demilitarize UA

&amp;#x200B;

2 Connect Crimea to Russia through land bridge 

&amp;#x200B;

3 Secure Eastern Ukraine LNR/DPR 

&amp;#x200B;

The denazification thing goes hand in hand with point 1.

&amp;#x200B;

None of the objectives require capturing Kiev.  None of the objectives require storming Kharkiv or other large cities (other than perhaps Odessa if Russia wants to completely landlock Ukraine, though this is rather up in the air as to whether or not RU will judge it as worth the cost to take) and none of the objectives are being seriously stalled by Ukraine.  

Nobody knows the actual death count on either side but it is clear that there are hundreds of videos of mass surrenders by Ukrainians and there are 0 videos of mass surrenders by Russians.  That is a key point.  Those videos aren't fake, even if they are used for propaganda purposes.

I’m not the JFK fan, I think he was a pretty terrible president in almost every way, but he threaded the needle on some of those issues and used periods of nuclear escalation to deescalate. He should have cut off the bay of pigs assault even before he did, but the point is he did. 

Except it is actually beside the point. The point is that Gitmo has a lease and the US has kept the terms of the lease. If Cuba and the Cuban people want the lease to end, I *absolutely* understand and support them making their case. I support any diplomatic action on the issue. I support calling out the US abuses/war crimes there. 

I’m saying that claiming it’s an imperialist hijacking of the land is a ridiculous statement. It’s a lease. With payments provided for every year. Per the terms of the lease. With no accusations that the US illegally or immorally acquired the lease by refusing food aid to starving people unless the lease was given, or some such. 

I’m saying that claims of imperialism are not actually going to effect any change regarding the return or Gitmo to Cuban control. I’m saying that if Cuba wants the best chance of getting it back (the opportunity which may have now passed), the best chance is to go on the world stage, highlight the war crime tortures that took place there.

3964,[],False,,TheSwissNavy,,,,,,"&gt; I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin's views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.

- Nikita Khrushchev

&gt; Without American machines the United Nations could never have won the war

- Joseph Stalin

&gt; Today some say the Allies didn't really help us ... But listen, one cannot deny that the Americans shipped over to us material without which we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to continue the war.

Mariupol is a great example, the Russians have obliterated that city and control nearly all of it but that fact there are still fighters holding out there after all this time in my opinion is a loss for Russia and win for Ukraine. For Russia to win they have to demonstrate they have an effective global military that can achieve clear objectives whilst minimising loses. By that measure Russia is losing massively and this operation is a huge disaster for them. Ukraine only has to keep fighting and not give up and it’s a win for them. The whole world supports Ukraine and wants them to keep going where’s as most of the world now despises Russia, NATO is more united than ever, their economy is in ruins and when the Russian people finally learn the truth of just what this disaster has cost them in money and lives Putin’s legacy is now one of shit. Think of it this way … if you started a fight with a 5 year old child and they managed to pull your pants down exposing your tiny dick, break both your arms, blacken your eye and bloody your nose it doesn’t matter if you eventually knock that child unconscious your 100% not a winner and that child is not a loser. The more Ukrainians that die fighting for their homeland the more respect the world has for these people prepared to give their lives for freedom. Russian can’t win now. They’ve fucked up to much, right now they are just looking for a way to lose and save some face.

The initial engagement starts from the side of the camera though, that is clear enough.

The problem with suppressed weapons and appropriate ammunition is that you can't really tell where you're being shot from, if you're at the receiving end. All you hear is pops around you but no clear sounds or muzzle flash so if there's not a solid surface that the bullets hit, to narrow down the angles of the incoming fire, you have to rely on very subtle visual cues. In night time, that makes identifying incoming fire without appropriate gear, almost impossible. I attribute the initial confusion of the Ukrainians to that.

The Stinger is amazingly simple to use but can easily be decoyed with flares, like most heat seeking missiles. 

A good comparison is the Falklands campaign.  The Brits (SBS, iirc) took both Stingers and the predecessor to the Starstreak with them.  The Starstreak predecessor was a new system, so only one man was trained on it.  He was killed in an attack on a ship, iirc, and no one could figure out how to use the weapon.

You spread out your troops so that if you explosive fire (artillery, IED, tank, ect...) you minimise the risk of it causing multiple casualties. It also allows troops to disperse across a longer line of fire quicker and avoids soldiers crossing over each other's fire. 

It also helps when retreating a position. You retreat in a staggered formation. Usually two guys provide cover fire whilst the rest fall back. Then two other soldiers provide cover fire whilst the rest fall back. Rinse and repeat until safe or until you can establish visuals and formulate a plan.

2. Is there some expert tactic conserning hidden enemies? At what situation should you shoot around even when you do not see the enemy? My non-expert idea in the heat of the combat would be that if I do not see a target, then I will always shoot the second best hiding place that I currently see. Because the enemy assumes I can guess that he is in the best hiding place, so he has moved to the second best hiding place. If I have ammunition left, I should *always* do this. Because running out of ammo is a lot less catastrophic than dying with lots of ammo left. How does the tank commander think about stuff like this professionally?

Can you please detail your argument from the beginning, because I'm not following. My ""belief"" is that human life is not inherently more or less valuable than an animal's; at the very least, nobody proved otherwise. You are trying to prove me wrong but failing (the burden of proof is on you, I hope you agree).


If you're trying to turn this into a game of popularity (e.g. ""most people value human life more than animal life""), you are *at best* stating the current state of things, not an universal truth, and you might wake up tomorrow in a society that values animals more than humans, at which point you would be in a minority. Does being in a minority make you wrong?

&gt;  
&gt;It also spoke of 116 dead and more than 100 missing crew members of the sunken Moskva cruiser.  
&gt;  
&gt;The post was soon removed, but it is available in the web archive.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the morning of April 22, the publication reported that its account in ""VKontakte"" was allegedly hacked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier, a senior NATO military official said that the Alliance estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the four weeks of war in Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the Russian losses ""substantial"" in an interview with Sky News the day before, saying it was a ""great tragedy.""  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the latest figures from the AFU General Staff, Russia lost more than 21,200 soldiers in the war.

You obviously didn't pay attention to 2000 years of philosophical discussions on ethics. This line of thought (""any human life is more important than all animal life"") easily escalates to ""any [insert nationality] life is more important than [foreign nationality] life"". This happens because you've decided to start ranking life based on perceived importance, so once you start it becomes a slippery slope.


Sadly, stupid thoughts like the one you decided to express have lead to many tragedies throughout history; for example, the phrase ""we're saving American lives"" has resulted in huge number of dead civilians who were unfortunate enough to have the wrong passport. Not picking on Americans here, other nations had the same idea.


Just to make it clear, human life is not inherently more important than an animal's life; so this idea ""better for all animals to die than a single human"" comes from either from some sort of emotionally dubious mindset, or from some perception that humans add some type of value to the universe.

Says the guy who asks why the surrounded, outnumbered, and besieged defenders can't simply fish for enough food and desalinate enough water for thousands of them stuck in that steel plant.

&gt;I said the river is somewhat what separates the Soviets from the Ukranians

The Soviets? What year do you think this is?!

&gt;I said there is an inlet and you assume I mean the canal. South of the Steel plant is an inlet. Tell me what the pollution levels are since your making the accusation.

My town had one of the largest zinc, iron mines and steel mills in the east coast of the US, it was still not even half as large of an industrial complex as Azovstal. It operated from the  1890s until the 1980s, and the pond and river ways around the former complex are still heavily polluted from those processes. 40 years later. 

AzovStal has been operating as such an industrial facility for around the same amount of time (90 years) and was built, designed, and operated by the Soviets- who aren't exactly known for their environmentally friendly industrial policies and practices- for most of that time. 

Or you could just, you know , look up the pollution levels online.. that is one of the perks of the internet afterall...

&gt;It's war, nothing is 100% safe. Noticed I've said relatively safe but you keep adding more and more. Your playing the ""what if"" game. What if a spaceship patrolled the plant? what if a comet came and killed them all? what if.... 

Nothing I've said is a ""what if"".

Them being surrounded by hostile snipers and artillery? Yeah! That's kinda been a little of an issue for them this whole time. 

&gt;You are the one who imagined them casually strolling up and catching enough fish to feed everyone. When did I say that? This is you adding your own context to fit your own argument.

Whereas you don't seem to even get either of the concepts you're even arguing about..

Even if they could safely fish and miraculously catch and process enough to feed *over a thousand people* every day, that fish would be toxic and cause further disease and harm in the community... and thats not even to mention the whole fresh water problem again. 

What you are implying and suggesting for them to do is just as far fetched as it being as simple as them casually strolling up and having a leisurely fishing trip down by the river..",a12f76c0615a58ccb7ded2367bceb031e2c47e07,True,False,,,,,0,1650702640,,0,{},i5uu717,False,t3_u9vhg7,False,True,t1_i5urat9,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9vhg7/question_about_the_war/i5uu717/,1650702656,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650673840.0,[],text,t2_epakr,False,False,

for example, in 2015, well over 60% of the front page was friendly towards conservative points of view. Not anymore. Aaron Swartz the cofounder ""suicided"" himself after FBI involvement. The website was caught editing user comments and hiding the notation, meaning courts cant use user messages anymore as evidence like they once were. And any ideology that ran opposed to the big corporate and federal government narrative has been censored, pruned, quarantined, or removed. 

Even just try asking a mundane question about covid at one point and you'd find your account banned from subreddits you'd never even been too. 

Its been a 4-6 year process. Reddit used to be where you'd find big news. But we learned after the Orlando Florida massacre that this isnt true. /Politics was censoring any mention of it. This actually was a huge boost to The_DohnaId when it was around because it was the one place you could discuss a Muslim shooting and killing 50 gay people. ANd that was just the start. I remember w/ Hillary's IT guy got found out asking how to delete VIP info on reddit and thousands of people were engaging with it and then I saw the account get deleted in real-time, and within 3 days it was memory holed forever. 

Pair the extreme censorship with the astro-turfing of things that make no sense, and you have curated content. Random photos from tiny subreddits about things that many people have little concern for suddenly getting 15k upvotes when the next most popular thing on the subreddit has 12 votes? Yeah, likely astro-turfing.

That is false. They specifically censor what they dont want you to see and astro-turf what they do want you to see. 

That is how time after time we saw things like photos of Trump doing a thumbs up w/ a woman in a Hijab on the front page get removed out of nowhere, AMAs get removed, and many other populist subreddits get removed, but then other things people dont care about (even the comments were noting) get pushed to the front. Now people are just used to it and its been a couple years and so many of the traditional users have left the site you have an echo chamber left behind. 

In 2015 the front page was well over 60% conservative. Now its less than 10% and it generally happens when smaller less known subreddits or things like wallstreetbets makes it to the front page. 

Reddit's admins were **literally caught** editing user messages and then **hiding** the notation. It was a big deal, iirc around 2016, because reddit messages used to be used in court sometimes to prove cases but they cant be used anymore because the website's own admins fucking blew it. 

If you are interested in the subject, **google Aaron Swartz** the cofounder. There were youtube documentaries about him. He was very pro-free speech. Very important to reddit.

You think a steel mill doesn't have 55 gallon drums laying around? 

Again if it were that easy, nowhere in the world next to massive oceans would have water shortages.


&gt;Go look up the energy requirements for desalination and you'll find your answer. Plus a manor issue is what to do with the leftover salt. However, you don't seem like someone who looks for answers. 

Oh yes, but thousands of troops and civilians surrounded in a 1930s era Soviet steel mill in a city that's 98% destroyed by over a month of siege surely have enough energy to desalinate enough water to be comfortable... from toxic water next to and surrounded an incredibly polluted industrial facility whereas California, Saudi Arabia, or even Crimea prior to this war somehow didn't have enough energy to do so...

&gt;Plus a manor issue is what to do with the leftover salt. However, you don't seem like someone who looks for answers. 


One solution for all that leftover salt is to literally put it back into the ocean where it came from, or use that salt for other purposes such as to make chemicals like sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.

&gt;You fail to realize Ukraine owns the whole compound. It's war your going to have people around you trying to kill you. So do you just starve to death because someone might kill you? Do you sit in a hole and just starve? Apparently you do.

Generally in the course of human warfare, people in that situation have four options: fight to the death, break out of the encirclement, starve to death or die of thirst, malnutrition or disease, or surrender.

&gt;you need a lot of specialized gear to A. Catch said steam B. Condense the water vapor and turn it into water again C. Do that enough to meet the needs of over a thousand defenders and however many civilians are there.

You need zero specialized gear to catch steam.. Like what world do you live on? Have you ever boiled water on a stove with a lid? There are numerous materials/methods in doing this. NEWS FLASH  Steam condenses when it's cooled below it's boiling point. So if somehow you can keep it below 212° fahrenheit it is possible. You think a steel mill doesn't have 55 gallon drums laying around? 

&gt;If desalination were as easy as ""boil salt water and catch steam"" then places right next to the pacific ocean or any other large body of salt water wouldn't have been facing water shortages for decades and /or had to invest hundreds of millions in far more complicated desalination plants.

Go look up the energy requirements for desalination and you'll find your answer. Plus a manor issue is what to do with the leftover salt. However, you don't seem like someone who looks for answers. 

&gt;1. Its not as simple as ""They're just starving""... instead they are starving and surrounded by people, tanks, artillery, and naval assets pointing things that can and will murder them if they step out from their shelter.

You fail to realize Ukraine owns the whole compound. It's war your going to have people around you trying to kill you. So do you just starve to death because someone might kill you? Do you sit in a hole and just starve? Apparently you do.

&gt;2. Russian troops are getting resupplied with fresh food and water as well as munitions far more often than the outnumbered and surrounded Ukrainians.

We do have some deeply embedded needs, but even with an outside source if we don't evolve past this ignorance no matter what we experience we'll find a way to revert.

At this point the majority of powerful religions are all monotheistic, yet have variables that are used to justify death upon the opposing party.

Race is majorly fought upon over culture issues and/or past experiences (now) and not really innate beyond uneducated micro societies. 

Tribalism can be earned through achievement, progress and ""group verified"" achievements. You say aliens would unite us, and I don't disagree, as sure as fuck we'd unite to bawl up an invader, but if we look at the probability of a sentient species coming to Earth in our current state.... it's not good.

What I'm trying to say is I think we can find a point where when we give up the dumb shit most people base their lives off of (and hly fucking shit why?!!?) there's even (as in fair) opportunity for the risk and reward to be measurable and sustainable amongst the population. The elimination of religion drastically reduces any/all conflicts when WHT goal of any/all opponents are directed to economic growth and prosperity.

I don't see any problem with this ideal other than the ""faith and religion"" of anyone involved.

This view is ignorant and causing the problem. It isn't we have it so engrained,

 it's that we don't fight against it. Evolution isn't about accepting your shit, it's about telling your shit it isn't going to work anymore and you can die or be better because of what you fucking learned.",42bd188cffcf5545a38e41ed66add10eb86a7f74,True,False,,,,,0,1650697593,,0,{},i5uo5se,False,t3_u8bvmd,False,True,t1_i5kz8te,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u8bvmd/videos_from_todays_420_rockets_from_gaza_to_israel/i5uo5se/,1650697607,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650668793.0,[],text,t2_6o322,False,False,

Bush and the republicans had free reign to be absolute pricks to everyone because of the 9/11 sympathy and America's lust for a violent revenge. They took full advantage and it was very clear that it was a war for profit from the beginning.

Occam's Razor says there is no fancier equipment in numbers ready to pour into Ukraine.

The reality is that the reserves that make up the huge numbers of tanks on paper are *truly* older gear. Like T-72's without engines or turrets or optics. There are literally tank graveyards with thousands of these things. They're not going to be retrofitted up to T-14 standards - no, if they're reactivated, they'll be reactivated to old, cheap standards. Enough to roll and shoot shells and eat a missile.

In addition, the missiles blowing them apart cost thousands when the equipment costs hundreds of thousands/millions. Even if they start refitting out old ass tanks, they'll just eat an older rocket.

So far the philosopher who helped me to understand it is Hobbes (Calvin’s Tiger’s namesake) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes

Hobbes describes the the life of the crab as the natural state of nature; a world without society. In the state of nature men behave as beasts in the war between all for all. It’s kill or be killed in a struggle for resources.

At one point two men agreed not to kill each other and formed the first social contract. A sacrifice of freedom in exchange for security. Eventually tribes were formed and people learned to live together under a sovereign. We agreed to certain rules and obstructions of our natural freedoms in exchange for greater security.

Well these tribes of people grew greater and greater until we have nation states, and people who identify with the tribe of say, Ukraine or Russia, the US and Vietnam.

Soldiers are the tip of the spear when it comes upholding the social contract, they live on the fringe of society and exist in a state of nature, kill or be killed, in order to uphold the society they are from.",0280b842b37e5c1cb8c29d185267671cbdafa47d,True,False,,,,,0,1650686519,,0,{},i5u89u9,False,t3_u9vpxw,False,True,t1_i5u4b7o,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9vpxw/entente_troops_storm_the_beaches_of_gallipoli_and/i5u89u9/,1650686536,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650657719.0,[],text,t2_aifeykj5,False,False,

The newer AK-12/15 are much better with rails all over like M4's, but it appears Russia hasn't purchased and distributed a lot of these (or hasn't issued a lot of optics in general). Basically there's a billion and one AK variants across manufacturers, countries, and design tweaks which can be extremely subtle.

One other example is the Dragunov ""sniper"" rifle (only accurate to about 500 meters, so more of a designated marksman rifle) has a long barrel which is just a bare barrel in the forward quarter/third of the weapon, so if you're resting the gun somewhere for a more stable shot, you would prefer not to rest the barrel itself on anything for repeatability of your shot and accuracy. It's better to place it on the foregrip area.

See the HK416 (M4 with a short-stroke gas piston versus old M4 direct impingement) derived marksman rifle adopted by the US: M110E1.

I also did a little back of the envelope math for fun which might give an idea

A M67 grenade has a 182g charge and can kill at up to 5m radius. A 9M27F has a 51.7kg charge so assuming same explosive chemical energy density it should have 284x the energy in each explosion.

Now given that overpressure should be dependent on air volume then that should decrease by the inverse cube law so 284^(1/3) = 6.6x the radius (33m) for overpressure blast injury compared to the grenade. Now this is a lot bigger than the 20m kill radius from rocket specs so I think you can explain it by the fact that the 5m quoted kill radius for the M67 is probably its lethal frag radius with lethal blast radius being smaller.",9c7ad76a96976442c17e0a833dd3249791515d57,True,False,,,,,0,1650685430,,0,{},i5u6c2o,False,t3_u9rp2p,False,True,t1_i5th54y,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9rp2p/three_ukrainian_smerch_missile_systems_strike_in/i5u6c2o/,1650685445,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650656630.0,[],text,t2_dj9au,False,False,

Even if the ATGM/other type of projectile hit the engine block and not the crew compartment, it's absolutely amazing how much better these support troops in transport compared to the HMMV's of 2003. When MRAPs were going through an initial trial deployment, I believe there were seven IED attacks and only one injury in total, which is when the US military put in a ton of purchase orders.

Thankfully the US military has a shitload of up-armored HMMV's in long term storage depots around the US and around the world, but MRAP's of different design and size are the standard transport, if they're not already being carried in a mechanized infantry unit with Stryker/Bradley armor.

After the Abrams and Bradelys, the MRAPs and perhaps much later, at least a portion of other transport vehicles will be getting the hard kill active protection system. There are two being purchased from two different Israeli defense contractors, and the US is also developing one of their own. I think the future will likely add an automated laser defense ""turret"" on top to assist the kinetic APS, as that also provides all of those vehicles with a weapon to take down drones, destroy ATGMs from further distances,""dazzle"" ATGM sensors/sights/targeting mechanism, and would be able to take out mortar shells high in their arc rather than the APC which is for close range defense just outside the vehicle it's defending.

A lot of US military tech, and I assume other countries too, have been and are developing all of their new systems with open architecture, in other words modular. Theoretically, this means a future relatively low cost high-powered defensive laser system light enough and small enough on friendly vehicles and armor will have the capability to connect with other countermeasures of the vehicles systems and likely to the other vehicles within the convoy to protect against multiple simultaneous incoming threats. I believe just two weapons right now still get through due to their weight and kinetic energy: tank and artillery shells.",b1500b9b57e9b875fc0025d7bd1226e105ab7e76,True,False,,,,,0,1650684362,,0,{},i5u4ect,False,t3_u9lmmk,False,True,t3_u9lmmk,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u9lmmk/sdf_atgm_strike_on_a_turkish_kirpi_mrap_earlier/i5u4ect/,1650684375,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650655562.0,[],text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,

Some of their more recent videos seemed real though. They were actually getting return fire and getting injured and killed. Soon after that, they decided to stop attacking in Mariupol.

Similarly as it would for a human child that was innocent with little to no ability for comprehension of the situation.￼￼￼￼￼ 

That being said, it is hard to reconcile that feeling with how brutal and terror filled the vast majority of animals’ lives are.￼

Also I guess a little bit for me it depends on the lifestyle of that animal. A wild animal, used to terror in some sense, being in a terrible situation somehow doesn’t make me as viscerally upset as a pet who is loved, taken care of, with little to no interactions in their life that involve terror, all the sudden being at the receiving end of such incomprehensible and abject terror. When I get a pet, I really make a solemn promise with myself and them that I will take care of them, keep them from danger and terror, because I am lucky enough to be a human, with a brain that understands suffering, and with the ability to act so that the animals in my care don’t experience suffering unduly.￼￼￼￼￼￼ ￼

But you’re absolutely right, it’s interesting and weird that so many people can watch videos of humans causing terrible violence towards each other, but refuse to watch things involving animals getting hurt at the hands of humans.

&gt;In other words, noises above 120dB to 140dB are beyond safe levels and can cause hearing loss in dogs. Unfortunately, most guns produce sounds that are higher than 150dB and adding muzzle brakes or other modifications can increase the noise levels by several decibels. Although dogs generally have the ability to block out some sounds and tune in to others, the noise of gunfire occurs too rapidly for the mechanisms to protect their sensitive inner ear, thus increasing the risk of permanent hearing loss.

Every country in the region was historically its own distinct entity though, only briefly united under the oppression of the Soviet Union. That is the reason why everybody hates the guts out of each other in the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, cause when the Soviet Union broke up, it did so chaotically.

So, sure but anyone can take a misinformed grandma or a plant and make an interview, much more in these lands where there are border disputes in literally every country around here. It's the oldest trick in the book and I think pretty much every country in the area pulled that card at some point or another at its neighbours, mine included. I live *just* next door of an ex-Soviet Union country, by the way and only a bloody civil war spared us from it.

Still, it takes a daft person, or an uninformed one, to not be able to realise that this is also a very much exploitable problem for any major player that wants to exploit it and Putin has been doing just that since 1999 with the false flag apartment attacks that he credited to the Chechens. Then Georgia followed under a similar pretext, check out what Abkhazia means. Then Ukraine, same tactics in 2014 and attempted a Ukraine v.2 but failed miserably cause at some point, people catch up to your bullshit.
It's exactly the same tactics, copied and pasted straight out of the Soviet playbook and implemented time and time again. If you think, on the other hand, Putin gives two shits about the Russian grandma, you're terribly mistaken.

Everything that has been done, in every country, wether it was Chechnya, Georgia or Ukraine was done under false pretexts. Check the history of each country individually and how the people ruling actually got to power. Each of the countries I mentioned had devastating wars in the past 20 years where **every.** **single.** **time.** Russia was the perpetrator. If we go further back in time, the shit that unfolds and spreads over the entire region is full of blood, murder and genocide.

And all that, so Putin and his friends can enjoy 700m $ yachts and cruises in the Mediterranean.

This is just a stupid, thickheaded way to spin it. 

&gt; What's funny is all these years you guys cracked down on communists in your own countries to the point that it was a crime to be communist. 

It wasn't a crime actually.

And this is is 70 years later.

I'm sorry you don't like the Kurds. They've been good friends to the US. Like I said, everyone is in this for their own interests. 

&gt; At the same time you are supporting communist guerrillas that are aiming to destroy Turkey.

The US isn't supporting rebels in Turkey or aiming to destroy Turkey. They're supporting other Kurds. 

I'm sorry your victim complex is this extreme. 

&gt; Well, I hope making Turkey your enemy 

This makes us enemies? 

I'm sorry you have a huge victim complex and rabid nationalism that can see or do no wrong. 

This brings me back to the classic days of /r/combatfootage, when it was just fending off rabid Turkish, Pakistani, and Indian dipshits here to vomit their shit all over the place.

There aren't any I've seen specifically on crew survivability against modern ATGMs, however all of the studies done before this one point to the same thing [armor sustains fewer casualties than infantry](https://smallwarsjournal.com/documents/urbancasstudy.pdf) despite being a far higher value target. [it's really consistent](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.683.2994&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) even recently more armor = fewer casualties. 

Studies on tank crew survivability going back to WWII have found that a little more than 1 person died per crew when a tank was penetrated, considering percentage of armored crews becoming casualties has dropped significantly since WW2 I would imagine that number has at least remained relatively the same.

What makes you think this is the real death of the tank? literally every single anti-tank innovation since the tank was invented has been hailed as the death blow of the tank, including the introduction of ATGMs.

Hell the army [had to scramble to up armor](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4731185) Humvees in Iraq because they were getting shredded compared to Armor/Armored Infantry units. If anything recent trends have pointed toward *more* military units needed significant amounts of armor. Not less.

You need to look up what a platoon is made up of before you say dumb shit. 4 squads in one platoon could be hitting 4 places a few clicks apart and the defenders would have no idea that there were other attacks happening. try imagining with your feeble mind one objective, one squad located to the north east of it, one located 2km directly east, one south east, one south. the one directly east attacks a checkpoint, south east attacks a trenchline, while they do that north east and south move through the front line and attack the main objective behind it. If done properly no one will have any idea they are under attack until it's too late. 

The above example is an incredibly basic attack plan and not at all uncommon.

I'm literally giving an opinion based on the fact that many of these are obviously being shot by the same unit. It is 1) unlikely they are flying this unit all over the place and making them do back to back to back missions 2) equally unlikely that after being hit anyone (from barely trained Islamist militias to hardened Americans) Would be doing things like talking on the phone during a patrol. Generally, knowing an SOF unit is hitting your area of the front makes people incredibly jumpy and alert.

This doesn't mean they aren't separate missions, I just find it relatively unlikely. 

4 squads is one platoon, a platoon hitting one objective from multiple places is not unusual or unheard of, especially for special forces units. If you're going to talk about shit you clearly know nothing about don't be a hostile cunt about it.
