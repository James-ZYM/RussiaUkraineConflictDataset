Putin is an ex spy. He has literally been trained to have control over all his displayed emotions, and to use them for manipulation. It's all an act. He changes based on what is advantageous. The image of being ""angry"", the nuclear drill, changing Belarus constitution to allow nuclear weapons, and the heavy troll posts, it was for this reason. Threats only work if people believe they might be realized. Don't take anything he says or does at face value - it's all theater. He doesn't want to see his legacy destroyed, he doesn't want to die, and he is a pragmatist.

Did you read the letter from the FSB whistleblower? I think he got it right.

To quote you the relevant (translated) parts,

&gt; From the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that VV Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.

&gt; Firstly, there is more than one person making a decision, at least someone will jump off. And there are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".

&gt; Secondly, there are some doubts that everything is functioning successfully there. Experience shows that the greater the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. And where it is not clear who controls and how, but always bravura reports - everything is always wrong there. I'm not sure if the red button system works as advertised. In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.

&gt; Thirdly, and this is the most vile and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the readiness to sacrifice oneself of a person who does not let the members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers, come close to him. For fear of the coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter. If you are afraid to let the most trusted people near you, then how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones, inclusive?",e1721cbd6b982af98e73f3b1345c4f096aa246e5,True,False,,,,,0,1646868653,,0,{},i01ec3j,False,t3_t887ng,False,True,t1_hzs5als,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t887ng/ukraine_soldier_says_us_not_honoring_their/i01ec3j/,1646871298,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646839853.0,,,,

False.

&gt; By March 2015, the US had committed more than $120 million in security assistance for Ukraine and had pledged an additional $75 million worth of equipment including UAVs, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies, according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
That assistance also included some 230 armored Humvee vehicles.
Trump appears to be echoing a critique leveled at the Obama administration by the late Republican Sen. John McCain. ""The Ukrainians are being slaughtered and we're sending blankets and meals,"" McCain said in 2015. ""Blankets don't do well against Russian tanks.

Russia had at that time covertly already crossed the border and had already shelled Ukraine from within Russia. I am not sure what Biden had in mind that they could do which would not receive a full response, but anything that also targets Kiev is definitely not a small incursion.

&gt; The truth lies somewhere in between

This is the middle-ground fallacy. That both sides are incorrect does not mean that the truth is in the middle. Instead you have to critically evaluate what you hear.

There are some fundamental properties of the world that makes it so that the truth is often closer to one of the extremes than the middle. Ofc both camps tend to believe they are the right one though so what should be mostly harshly scrutinized is one's own convictions.

&gt; watching the left blame Trump

Trump is a significant factor in the current development and is very much to blame. For undermining NATO, for saying that Putin might as well have Crimea, for not doing anything about Putin's violation of the Minsk agreement, and for withholding defense from Ukraine.

He repeatedly has asked for support after the invasion so my assumption is that he thought he was protected at a much higher level then he actually is. So I just wonder if he would have made the same decision if he knew exactly what help he would receive and what help he wouldn’t.

Some things are worth fighting and dying for and the freedom of your homeland from foreign invaders is one of those things.

I hold out hope that as the effects of the sanctions kick in and the news of the war trickles in past the propaganda machine that the pro-war support in Russia will decline and the protests will grow.

It seems strange that international community has to rebuild Ukraine and support the collapsing Russian economy after a treaty for preventable damage inflicted by a madmen and a people not aware of the wounds created. 

For example, couldn't the international community present Russians with a thorough calculation of the costs for rebuilding, growing by each bombardement, day by day.

It seems rediculous that the cost of repair of torn down cities, is not something Russians are day by day confronted with financially too.

It's a hotel that had this one floor which was KGB operations centre. They have a museum there now. Many who opposed the soviets and advocated independence found their end in these rooms sadly.

When they tried to break through to places like Amiens they came across allied supply dumps containing everything from beer to canned meats, jam, chocolate - luxuries the German soldiers hadn't seen for years. This had 2 effects:

- Morale suffered as they saw a huge contrast between what they were getting and what the allies had. 

- Discipline broke down almost entirely. There are numerous accounts from German officers that their units basically turned into mobs a hairs breadth away from open mutiny, ignoring their orders and simply gorging themselves on captured food.

“The attempt to lay this at Churchill’s door stems from a sensationalist book published in 2010 by a Bengali American journalist called Madhusree Mukerjee.  As its title, Churchill’s Secret War, indicates, it was a largely conspiracist attempt to pin responsibility on distant Churchill for undoubted mistakes on the ground in Bengal.  The actual evidence shows that Churchill believed, based on the information he had been getting, that there was no food supply shortage in Bengal, but a demand problem caused by local mismanagement of the distribution system.

This was largely the result of wartime supply constraints, with most of Bengal’s boats commandeered or disabled, and uneasy relations between the elected, Muslim-led, coalition government of Bengal and its largely Hindu grain merchants, notorious for hoarding and speculation.  Churchill had resisted the 1935 constitution granting Indian provinces autonomy; but, by the 1940s, he regarded the food situation in Bengal as primarily a matter for its elected ministry rather than Whitehall.  Within the War Cabinet itself, Churchill’s role was one of broad oversight, rather than detailed management, so the idea that he had much influence on actual relief aid to Bengal is far-fetched, especially at the height of the war.”",c3381d86c1bd45229245dda211e3ad166ec563b1,True,False,,,,,0,1646817652,,0,{},hzybr70,False,t3_t9lagm,False,False,t1_hzvxokk,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t9lagm/zelensky_our_modern_churchill_and_a_war_leader/hzybr70/,1646817664,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1646788852.0,,,,

I agree that dogs are most likely. Many people probably couldn't make accommodations to take their pets when they fled, and let them go to forage for themselves. I was seeing footage of dogs running along the roadside following vehicles. 

Domestic dogs will not always exhibit the same behavior of scattering a carcass like wild animals; they are more likely to feed in place. People are speculating birds as well, and this is also likely, but those bones look pretty well chewed and the tendons severed. More likely a larger animal (or several) with teeth for rending. Also, birds would most likely start with the eyes/face first.

It is so unfortunate that this is this person's fate; not a fate that he nor anyone who knew him would have chosen, I'm sure.

In fact, many Ukrainians are ethnically Russian and speak Russian, not Ukrainian- this is especially the case in the East of Ukraine. Yet these people are Ukrainian, and to be Ukrainian means to be of a free people. Ukraine is fighting for democracy, for the right of the Ukrainian people to decide their future. They are fighting for freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom to assemble, freedom of the press and of faith. Freedom to criticize their government and not worry about detainment or persecution from the state. They are fighting for economic freedom- towards the EU and the West, not towards the backwards, oligarchical state controlled economy of Russia. 

Certainly in some ways, the struggle of Vietnamese and Ukrainians can relate. But in many other ways they cannot. And certainly, Ukraine is not looking towards Vietnam, as a path of ""freedom"" they want to follow. It is not a secret that Vietnam remains impoverished, corrupt, and backwards. That the Vietnamese man and woman lacks even the most basic freedoms. If Ukrainians wanted that for their future, this war would not even be happening in the first place.

Not NATO aligned Ukraine is also simple. You may know, that Russia and Ukraine lie on massive plane. Goal of any regime located in Moscow always was moving the border with possible enemy as far away from Moscow as possible. This was the case for Russian Empire, Soviet Union and now Russian Federation.

Let’s assume that any regime located in Moscow consider NATO a possible aggressor:

If Ukraine remains neutral power, Russia has only one small frontline, where it can defend alongside its Union state partner Belarus against NATO — the Baltic and Polish frontline. Baltic can be easily cut off from Kaliningrad, and overall geopolitical position is favorable for Russia.

If Ukraine joins Russian Block, Russia effectively moves border up to Carpathian Mountains, which is a natural barrier.

If Ukraine joins NATO — Belarus is up in the open, only leaving it and defending heartland is possible way of defending. Not to mention how close possible nuclear weapons will be to Moscow, had the be located in, let’s say, Donbas.

As I said, taking nuclear power plants is really weird first priority, but their directions points to them, like recent one in Energodar. Most likely, Ukraine indeed tried to create a nuclear weapon for posing a threat to Russia to secede Crimea and Donbas, and they are moving to secure these researches (therefor Demilitarization of Ukraine)

They also are doing effort to assist local militias of separatist people’s republics, meaning one of their goal is to liberate them as claimed territories. To make that, you would need to encircle massive fortified army in Donbas.

Taking Kiev is unnecessary, because main Ukrainian army is in Donbas. If it falls — Ukraine would have no means of defending. They are interested in Russia aligned or at least non aligned to anyone Ukraine.

Therefor main political goals of Russians are:
- Demilitarization of Ukraine (destruction of possible nuclear weapon research)
- Liberation of LDPR and forcing Ukraine to recognize them as independent and Crimea as Russian
- Not NATO aligned Ukraine.

I hope I cleared everything up.

The other major cities need to be encircled and waited out for inevitable surrender. This is why in first days of conflict Russia targeted military airports, bases and command centers, as they had every information on their locations possible since soviet times.

Quite frankly, the only thing Ukraine can do in this situation is prolong the war for long enough, even if it costs civilian casualties. If we assume that what Konashenkov claimed is true, and Azov Battalion defenders of Mariupol are indeed using civilians as humans shields, lying about how Russians supposedly not cease firing — it would make it look like they are indeed trying to prolong the war for longer.

It would also seem like Russians are rushing for nuclear power plants, where they suspect nuclear weapon research is being condone, which is quite obvious, given pre-conflict Zelensky’s words about possible abandonment of Budapest Memorandum.

Therefor I suspect that russian army has 3 main goals:

* Encircling cities with mobile autonomous units, according to theory of Network-Centric Warfare
* Encircling main groups of Ukrainian Armed forces stuck on Donbas front (I.e. liberating Luhansk and Donetsk P.R.s, and LPR is 95% liberated)
* Demilitarization of Ukraine as stated by Putin (which probably entail ceasing all assets from possible nuclear weapon project)

These collide well with actual development of Russian armed forces.

***

On end note I can also add that I do not support this military operation, nor do I consider it necessary. However, given dire situation, the only “good ending” for this conflict is surrender of Ukraine. It will end suffering of all people in Mariupol, Kharkiv and other cities. Surrendering pride for civilian lives is not a bad thing, and Russians are definitely not Nazis who would murder all Ukrainian they see. Russian propaganda is based around ideas of liberation of Ukraine from fascism and Nazism, therefor it is clear that soldiers see themselves as liberators, not conquerors or demolishers.

This is how a nuclear bomb works.
""When a single free neutron strikes the nucleus of an atom of radioactive material like uranium or plutonium, it knocks two or three more neutrons free.""

This creates the nuclear explosion. I think the only way to deactivate these bombs are physically disabling it usually by disassembly. But I'm sure there's more than one method. For example pit stuffing

""This technology, which might be called ""pit-stuffing,"" was originally developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory to ensure that warheads that had been determined to be unsafe would not go off accidentally -- but it has never been applied to arms control. How does it work? Every modern ""boosted"" nuclear weapon has at its core a ""pit"" -- a hollow sphere of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium, with a tiny tube through it that allows the tritium to be fed into the hollow inside the sphere. If a steel wire is fed in through this small tube until the inside of the pit is ""stuffed"" with tangled wire, the pit can no longer be compressed enough by the explosives surrounding it to sustain a nuclear chain reaction -- the weapon is physically incapable of going off.""
