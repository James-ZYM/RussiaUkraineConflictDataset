There is large public belief in the Western media that Putin is unhinged and deranged, that Russian domestic support for this war is non-existent and that the actual combat is a staggering sequence of untenable Russian losses. Furthermore the economic sancitons are isolating Russia as a pariah throughout the world, creating domestic pressure for Russian regime change. If you believe that then you don't think there's any chance Russia will get southern Ukraine, or even keep Crimea.

I suspect the above position is completely mislead. I suspect Russia has had its setbacks but by and large is on track to achieving all of its military aims and have only diplomatic aims to accomplish after that. After Zelensky has finished his tour of Western leaders begging for a NATO level of involvement that will never come, after the Western media gets bored waiting for the stunning Ukrainian counter-offensive that never comes, and as the Ukrainian citizens start wanting to return to peace more than they want to deny the Russians the Donbass region, Russia will begin to get what it has demanded.

I think if Zelensky surrenders soon, while Ukraine still represents a country, Russia will not get much more than Crimea and the Donbass regions. I think if Zelensky refuses to surrender (out of pride?) and Ukraine continues to deteriorate and less and less represents a country and more and more becomes a humanitarian catastrophe, we get closer to a scenario where Russia claims the responsible thing is to take southern Ukraine (Odessa and a shared border with Transnistria) and eastern Ukraine, giving western Ukraine (particularly Lviv) to Poland. I would think it unlikely Kyiv becomes Kiev due to the demographics there so maybe it will become the centre of a landlocked Ukraine similiar in size to Moldova. It would be completely irrational for Zelensky to let it get that bad and I wouldn't expect that. However if Zelensky is compromised, e.g. by US parties, or Russia shifts the goalposts to something Zelensky will never accept, then we might get closer to such an extreme outcome.

At the end of the day, I think history will look on Zelensky as the man who lost (most of) Ukraine in a bad bluff.

The theory is that in 2011 the russian grain harvest failed, and russian had to import grain, while it usually exports grain. This lead to higher grain prices for countries usually reliant on russian grain. Such as Tunesia.

From the Chinese perspective, I understand Russia's been a reliable partner to them over the last couple decades, but that's no excuse to enable Russia' unprecedented war of aggression.

Here is a quote today from a Chinese FM today: ""China opposes unilateral sanctions, which do not bring peace and security but only cause serious difficulties to economies &amp; people's livelihoods in countries concerned, bring about a lose-lose situation and intensify confrontation: Chinese FM on #US bans of #Russian oil imports""

So, how does Russia's war of aggression against innocent civilians bring peace and security? How does it not cause serious difficulties to economies &amp; people's livelihoods? How is it not creating a lose-lose situation and intensify confrontation?

What China doesn't realize is that the West will become stronger by cutting Russia from its economy. It's definitely not a lose-lose. Billions and billions of dollars are being sent to Russian criminals and oligarchs every month. Once that money stays in friendly Western nations or friendly energy producers in other areas of the world, the alliance will become stronger. We always knew cutting Russian energy would be temporarily painful, but finally Putin has given the populations of the West rationale to accept rising prices if it means cutting off the dictator's economy.

*More on Crimea:*   Russia seeks agreement that it has the right to keep Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.   Crimea is site of  the  Sevastopol naval base, which has an history on Crimea that far predates [Khrushchev ""giving"" Crimea to Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point) in 1954.

Giving Ukraine the weapons and intel to defend themselves and not getting further involved is definitely the right strategy.

A front of unity from NATO and a degree of uncertainty/ambiguity about their planned responses might actually cause Russia to de-escalate, thereby avoiding conflict (it is a gamble though).

Russia is already using cluster bombs and indiscriminate shelling of civilians. The more this drags on the more brutal their methods will get. If Russia becomes convinced that Europe will not confront them will they start using chemical weapons in an attempt to force Ukraines submission?

Am glad to hear about the update you provided. Still don’t believe for a split second that any of the members of NATO will/should provide heavy wartime machinery (tanks, planes, boats, etc) as it would be pretty easy to spot an F16 in Ukraine and any of the aforementioned machinery is far more costly and deadly than a lone stinger or SRAW. I also would beg to differ that sending in fighter jets and other military aircraft would be seen as less or equal of a reaction that sending shoulder fired anti-armor weaponry. We’re talking about squadrons of fighter jets versus advanced RPGS. (Yes I know a Javelin and an RPG are worlds apart in terms of shoulder fired weaponry. I also recognize that 1 fighter jet with an experienced pilot can do a lot more damage than 1 Stinger OR javelin from an equally well-trained foot soldier.)

They can not engage in proper ground assaults. And russias jets are able to stay in the air longer and travel further. The amount of migs is negligible compared to russias air force which is currently being used sparingly due to the amount of anti air resources which have been supplied to Ukraine. But bringing the migs in would require Russia to overwhelm the air space to keep their options at air lifting in support troops (seems likely this is the plan at hostomel). This would take away the room Ukraine are currently enjoying allowing them to operate their Baryaktar drone strikes. 

Not only that but how do you prevent the migs from being targeted on any runway they were using as a base between sorties? Any airfield they used would be targeted and wiped out in short order. The only way to keep them safe on the ground would be to have them operate out of a nato airfield in neighbouring countries. This could be viewed as casus belli from putin to invade that country / kick off the hot War with nato. 

Lastly whilst bombs are being dropped on cities from planes, the main threat to the cities is the amount of artillery the Russians have and migs are not great at ground attack. 

Basically the mig is the wrong jet for the job and sending them to the ukraine will likely just result in the death of the pilots who use them, increased Russian air presence and little to no relief from artillery shelling of cities. 

20 odd obsolete jets are not capable on their own of turning the tide.

From Peter Zeihan(graphics missing):

Before Africa began the industrialization process, only the best lands on the continent were under cultivation. As a rule, slopes, jungle, arids, and marshes make for horrible farmland, and Africa was no exception. Africa in 1950 had well less than one-quarter of its land mass under crop, and yields per acre were decidedly pre-industrial.

But then the American-led globalized Order occurred. Africans were for the first time able to tap industrial inputs en masse: fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, better seeds and mechanical equipment. And above, finance, to allow for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, better seeds and mechanical equipment.
 


Fast-forward to the year 2000 and Africa became a continent changed. Add industrial inputs to okish lands and the Africans got great yields. Add industrial inputs to crap lands and the Africans got okish yields. In five decades, the Africans presided over the quintupling of their local food supplies. The reason we think of Africa as food insecure is because most African countries … are. Output may have increased by a factor of five, but during the same time window Africa’s population increased by a factor of six.

Industrialization is great…until it’s not. Nearly all of Africa’s agricultural inputs are imported from a different continent. Should anything happen to those input flows, much of what has made modern African agriculture successful will unwind with a vengeance…and Africa’s population will still need to be fed.

We’ve been babystepping to a collapse of agricultural supply chains for over a decade, but the sharp shock of the Ukraine War has kicked the deglobalization process into high gear. This calendar year we will experience breakdowns in the supply systems that make industrialized agriculture possible, and not just in Africa. The Middle East and East Asia also face a catastrophic unwinding of the input streams that keep regional populations alive, while major agricultural producers like Australia and Brazil will face challenges far beyond what their systems are capable of tolerating. The result is the same in all of them: lower yields.

And lower yields means famine.",9e260a9c7e452e4d99435f045b2f7f57ebe4839b,True,False,,,,,0,1646838639,,0,{},hzza06z,False,t3_ta52po,False,True,t3_ta52po,/r/geopolitics/comments/ta52po/lets_assume_two_things_drastic_increase_in_grain/hzza06z/,1646838655,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646809839.0,,

If they can, at the same time, defuse a potential instability/China stronghold in Latin America while at the same time gaining more oil resources (the US is one of the few countries in the world that can refine Venezuelan heavy oil), why wouldn't they?

""Russia has been a giant of the nonproliferation regime. The major treaties of the twentieth century all benefitted from the skills of Russian negotiators and the wisdom of Russian experts. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, also known as the NPT, a momentous agreement that has curbed the spread of nuclear weapons for over half a century, was the product of joint problem solving by Soviet and American diplomats at a time when the two superpowers were facing off over the Middle East and Vietnam. Tensions were so high that the United States raised the nuclear alert level in 1967 after jittery U.S. military commanders detected a mysterious disruption to their surveillance radars (caused, it turned out, not by Soviet machinations but by a solar flare). Somehow, no matter how bad the crisis, the two countries continued talking to keep nuclear weapons under control and prevent their spread.

The invasion of Ukraine may end this admirable tradition. Russia could become more isolated and cease to play any responsible international role, as Medvedev’s threat to leave the New START treaty and shutter the embassies in Moscow suggests. Alternatively, Moscow could remain broadly at odds with its Western rivals but pick some arenas, such as nuclear nonproliferation, where it sees mutual advantage in meeting at the negotiating table. The United States, for its part, should do what it can to keep Russia engaged and constructive in arms control diplomacy. But Washington has good reason to be wary of Moscow’s increasingly rogue behavior and it should consider turning to another rival, Beijing, in seeking to prop up the nonproliferation regime. The costs of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine continue to mount, but the United States should act to limit wider damage to the architecture of international security.""",3a1d37dbd55a1651e3f88cc9fac8495a25a47eb7,True,False,,,,,0,1646835297,,0,{},hzz2e6t,True,t3_ta8oge,False,True,t3_ta8oge,/r/geopolitics/comments/ta8oge/how_to_stop_a_new_nuclear_arms_race_with_russia/hzz2e6t/,1646835311,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646806497.0,,

&gt;There is no clear victory and no improving Russia's military image. Period.

This is an absurdly strong opinion. 

Lot of Russian failures have to do with fact their plans were based on assumption there would be very little resistance. Their officers on the ground were also informed about the actual plans just before the invasion and didn't have adequate time to prepare for something that wasn't going to work anyway because Ukrainians are fighting back way more than Russian leadership expected. 

Sure, it has shown Russia military has issues, but the war would look at lot different if the plans anticipated Ukranian reaction correctly (or simply didn't bet on a best case scenario).

I'm pretty sure Russia is not changing their plans and given overall advantage in terms of how much equipment they have has very high chances of victory.

&gt;Russia no longer has fear in its inventory of tools to use against its neighbors and the west.

Why? If anything, this has shown Putin is willing to use force to prevent neighboring countries from consistently pursuing hostile policy towards Russia. I'd say a lot of European countries are alarmed.

&gt;Any further move by Putin to try to secure his aims in Ukraine are just going to be further war crimes that will result in more political escalation and deeper economic ramifications by the west.

You actually think he'll give up? Also victory doesn't require war crimes.

https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1501344297098129411

&gt;Russia has made it clear that Ukrainian membership in the EU would be a red line (that's what drove the Maidan), as are a number of domestic policies it is pursuing. There was no recent movement for Ukrainian membership in NATO, which means it is a poor explanation for this war.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if NATO had declared Ukraine would never join, that would not have stopped this war. This was also driven by Ukraine's political orientation and Russia losing influence. Putin even said that Ukraine would present a threat even if it didn't join NATO.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, you can track comments from Putin and senior Russian officials over the past two years to see how the rhetoric shifted, largely in response to policies Zelensky pursued. Putin devoted an entire security council meeting to Ukraine in May after Viktor Medvedchuk's arrest.

&gt;  
&gt;It is important to note that this is a problem of Moscow's making. By removing the three most pro-Russia voting regions in Ukraine in 2014, Moscow forever altered Ukraine's political orientation and there wasn't much support for joining NATO before then.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier NATO expansion did play a role because it made Ukraine's political orientation more important to Russia. A hostile Ukraine meant that nearly all of Russia's western border is with non-friendly countries.

Would America or Turkey really go to war with Iran or Russia if the rebels they support are attacked?

SS: In repose to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, the American fast food giant McDonalds has announced that it will temporarily close its 850 stores across the Russian Federation, but will continue to pay its 62,000 employees in the country.

Amazon and Unilever are suspending large parts of their businesses, while PepsiCo and General Electric both announced partial shutdowns of their Russian business. 

Pizza Hut is in talks to close all of its locations and donate any proceeds to humanitarian efforts.

I'll just post some quotes from there.

""..Something tells me that the “indestructible and legendary” army, despite the billions poured in, is steadily decomposing on the way to complete degradation. There are many reasons for this, and we will now go through them.

Of course, if you believe the Zvezda TV channel, then our army is so good that any adversary will be crushed to dust in the shortest possible time.The proof of this is usually the victory over one of the strongest armies in the world in Georgia in 2008 and the battle in Syria with the terrorist group ISIS, banned in Russia, but not defeated, despite several statements by Russia.""

""...To what extent will the soldiers who are robbed by junior contract commanders be combat-ready? Absolutely not at all. One of those who recently served in the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division in the Bryansk region told me this: **it’s good that there were no fights with Ukraine, all the sergeants would have died in our first battle.**

**I predict in the event of a full-scale conflict of desertion simply in stunning proportions. It is good that there was no conflict with NATO on Ukrainian soil. I can imagine how the personnel of the same 3rd motorized rifle division would have fled, shooting at their internal enemies along the way**.""

If it is not deliberate misinformation (**and technically it could be, considering the date the article was published**) then it explains everything that is happening on Ukraine now.  
Deserting soldiers. Killed generals. Failed logistics. Abandoned Vehicles.  the puzzle fits together.

Since that would be quite costly for Russia, and they have already secured their main objectives (such as Tartous Naval Base and a friendly Syria), Russia told Assad it would not facilitate any further advances despite Syrian and Iranian desires for full reunification. While Iran has heavily intervened as well, I doubt they would want to engage in a full-on conventional war with the intervening powers, and will likely use subterfuge to slowly prise away territory, if they are even inclined to engage. Iran has their own problems with insurgents near the Turkish border, which would require the tacit acquiescence of the Turkish to resolve . It's also unclear if they could handle an all-out war with Turkey even with their regional interventions, so for them it is best not to risk it.
