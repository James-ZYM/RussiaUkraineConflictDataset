He's concerned that Russia is trying to push a narrative that Ukraine was making chemical weapons or had a nuclear weapons program so that Putin can detonate a dirty bomb or some kind of chemical attack as a reverse justification. 

Galeotti thinks, b/c Putin's kind of gotten stuck into this corner with the failure of the Russian army that he might be looking for some kind of way to stage a reset or to create some room to maneuver.

Stretch goal was to topple the government and to show a willingness to use power. I think conquest of the entire country was an optional goal that would be determined by the level of resistance. The aggressiveness of Putin's rhetoric and the size/scope of the invasion are to create a credible threat of total conquest with which to negotiate the primary goals, but it seems to me that is and was always too unrealistic.

I think they did not anticipate the level of Western response, but I also think they viewed the Ukraine situation as intolerable and unsolvable by other means, and so worth the risk. 

This is mostly based on how they dealt with Georgia in 2008.

Also note that in a way, these goals have been met or are close to being met. No one is really talking about getting those regions back. NATO was already nominally off the table but now people have more appreciation for how seriously Russia takes that red line. Ukrainian government probably more willing to negotiate on things like water rights for Crimea. Ukrainians did not think war was possible, and acted accordingly. Now they know it is possible, and will act accordingly. That could mean a few different things, of course. So from that sense, the ""operation"" was a success. Wider strategic implications?

If they still believe they can reinstall Yanukovych and establish a Russia friendly regime, I agree. But I don't know how they or anyone else could conclude that to still be a possibility. 

Russia conducts operations such as this with the goal of presenting the West with a *fait accompli.* They hoped to be in Kiev and installing a new government so that by the time the West could start to formulate a response, the matter was settled. It is extremely telling that the air assault of the Hostomel airfield was relieved by Rosgvardiya; they were already anticipating transitioning to occupation.

If this was still the goal and Russia were willing to pay the cost, I think there would more indicators suggesting it. I agree that Putin is not going anywhere, but I believe that if he was still planning on pounding Ukraine into total submission he wouldn't be trying to assure the Russian people that reservists and conscripts are not going to be sent to Ukraine (even if they already are). I also don't think they would be willing to do this because the longer it goes on, and the more damage done to Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian population, the less likely the West is to quickly remove sanctions. Sanctions that, should Russia obtain total victory, will become permanent. 

But most indications suggest that they replaced those goals with the comparatively more modest objectives of securing territorial recognitions along with few other concessions. If this is the case I do not believe time is on their side. I think every that they do from here is to strengthen their bargaining position.

Given what is coming out from the Israelis, Russia may be willing to accept demilitarization of Donbas and Ukraine willing to back down on joining NATO within the next 10-15 years. If that's the case it's very possible the war is over within the next week.

All in all, time will tell. Everyone's predictions on this, including my own, have been wrong. I could very well be wrong again. I focused a large part of academic life studying the foreign policy of Russia and the USSR. Ukraine and Belarus are two counties where Putin always considered their ascension to NATO a huge red line.

Germany is a country where nearly every family has a war story – many of them living war stories in grandparents or children affected by what their parents did, and where many of the men have experience being in the German army as conscription only ended a decade ago.  As Ukraine starting to kick-off, that triggered pretty substantial political shifts in the German public consciousness in terms of defense/energy policy – it's not a ""far off"" thing but the familiar specter of a landwar in Europe that really impacts folks.

🔺“The group of troops of the Luhansk People’s Republic, continuing offensive operations, took control of the settlements of TOSHKOVKA and GRACHEVO. The advance was 2 kilometers.

🔺Units of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic in the course of offensive operations advanced 4 kilometers and captured the settlements of SIGNAL, TARAMCHUK, ELENOV and LABOR.

🔺The depth of advancement of units of the people's militia of the Donetsk Republic in MARIUPOL per day was more than one kilometer.
 
🔺Units of the Russian Armed Forces took control of the settlements of KRASNAYA POLYANA and STEPNOE.

🔺 During the day of March 9, bomber and attack aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces destroyed 49 military facilities. Including: 2 command posts, 6 anti-aircraft missile systems, 4 ammunition and fuel depots, and 37 areas where weapons and military equipment are concentrated.
In total, 2786 military infrastructure facilities of Ukraine were destroyed during the operation.

Among them: 953 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 101 multiple launch rocket systems, 351 field artillery guns and mortars, 718 units of special military vehicles, as well as 93 unmanned aerial vehicles.

 Separately, about the results of the defeat of aviation and air defense systems of the armed forces of Ukraine.
🔺By the beginning of the special operation, the Ukrainian armed forces had up to 250 serviceable combat aircraft and helicopters.

🔺Russian aerospace forces destroyed 89 combat aircraft and 57 helicopters on the ground and in the air.
Part of the Ukrainian aircraft flew to Romania and does not participate in the battles.

🔺90 percent of Ukrainian military airfields, where the main part of military aviation was based, have been put out of action. There are practically no trained Ukrainian pilots of the first and second class left. To date, only single attempts to sorties by combat aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force have been recorded.

Now about the results of the defeat of Ukrainian air defense systems.
🔺During the operation, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 137 S-300, Buk M-1 and S-125 anti-aircraft missile systems. This is more than 90 percent of the long and medium-range anti-aircraft missile systems in service.

🔺81 Ukrainian air defense radar posts were destroyed This led to the loss of combat control of aviation and air defense of Ukraine. At present, the air defense system is only of a focal nature and is not capable of providing significant counteraction to Russian aviation.

🔺The leadership of the Ukrainian armed forces is trying to make up for the lack of information about the air situation by obtaining data from aircraft at the air force command post in Vinnitsa
E-3A of the AWACS-NATO system.

🔺These aircraft are on duty around the clock in the airspace of Poland.
 
🔺Unfortunately, several facts of the presence of conscripts in the units of the Russian Armed Forces participating in a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine were discovered.

Almost all such servicemen have already been withdrawn to the territory of Russia.

🔺At the same time, one of the units performing logistics tasks was attacked by a sabotage group of the national battalion.

🔺A number of servicemen, including conscripts, were captured.
At present, comprehensive measures are being taken to prevent the deployment of conscripts to combat areas and the release of captured servicemen.”",d239f070be647ca2105e9d52504f8f54cf74306e,True,False,,,,,0,1646844291,,0,{},hzzo4p4,False,t3_ta6y4o,False,True,t3_ta6y4o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ta6y4o/ukraine_megathread_march_9/hzzo4p4/,1646844318,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646815491.0,,

Your arguments demonstrate profound levels of ignorance at how the world works. They're at the level of claiming the Third Reich must never have had an anti-semitic policy because there were high ranking Nazis of Jewish descent. 

People like 'Aflaq were socialist intellectuals. Their own secularism doesn't mean the theories they develop didn't privilege Islam. Pol Pot came from the highly educated industrial elite, pointing out that fact doesn't somehow disprove that the Khmer Rogue privileged the working class and his theories ultimately opposed higher education and industrialization. As far as Aflaq's his legacy within Iraq Ba'athism, Saddam Hussein mythologized Aflaq as converting to Islam, because the theoretical basis of the ideology absolutely puts Islam at the center of an Arab nationalism. 

Of course the theories ultimately came out of Western socialism, and explicitly atheist ideologies like Marxism and their 20th-century developments. The fact that you can't understand how such a theory can give birth to an ethno-nationalist theory means you have a profoundly superficial understanding of history and the diversity of socialist ideology.

The international order is based purely on the United States' military hegemony. The United States believes in maintaining borders and state sovereignty where it suits our interests in securing a peaceful international order that facilitates unmolested world trade (where relevant to our interests). Of course under the intellectual framework that serves United States hegemony, we would grant Ukraine such a right. But such a right only exists insofar as United States and Western military might can secure it. If the United States doesn't care to secure such a right, and Russia is more committed to preventing Ukraine from acquiring such autonomy, then no such right actually exists.",e07b7d15c615546cdd794cf980e94a0fe9e641ca,True,False,,,,,0,1646843535,,0,{},hzzm63x,False,t3_t011qq,False,True,t1_hzjaqd8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t011qq/nato_officials_say_russian_attack_on_ukraine_has/hzzm63x/,1646843548,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646814735.0,,

According to the source u/QuailSparks provided Germany spent 13.25b Euro on personnel in 2020. France spent only 12.1b in 2020, while maintaining 21000 more active personnel (according to [globalfirepower.com](https://globalfirepower.com)). So they are definitely paying their servicemen less than the Germans, on average. 

I don't know about how they compare in terms of procurement and maintenance expenses or R&amp;D because of how different governments report their spending. For example, French total R&amp;D from their ministry of the armed forces amounts to 5.5b Euro, but most of it is not directly related to military purposes so other sources like [this paper](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R45441.pdf) list their defence R&amp;D spending as lower than Germany's - 1.4 vs 1.5 billion international dollars.

Not necessarily. Why'd you invest in a navy if you don't expect much action on sea? And focusing on the air and navy is to an extent enabled by geographic safety, if you are reasonably threatened by another land power invading your territory you'd have to focus more on ground forces as well.

""The Bundeswehr could save almost 33 million euros on each of its frigates currently being retrofitted with modern IT systems - if it signed better, professional contracts during procurement. When ordering IT systems for its frigates, the Navy ""made mistakes in project management,"" the auditors complain. ""As a result, the modernization of these systems, which are used to control radar systems and weapons, for example, was delayed by years. The costs per ship quintupled from six to 30 million euros,"" the report states.

[...]


For years, the authority has identified unnecessary additional costs and thus waste of taxpayers' money in the Bundeswehr. The force has poor contract and quality management, the auditors note. The Bundeswehr would repeatedly purchase and pay for services and weapons systems without having checked the performance of the supplies ordered or being able to take recourse against the supplier in the event of possible failures.

There was a similar case about two years ago, when guided missiles for warships that were not operational were ordered. They first had to be made ready for practical use at sea firing ranges. And each day on such a facility costs several million.""

Putin doesn't want nuclear war, but the spectre of it is probably his most powerful geopolitical tool. You can get away with a lot more if that is part of the calculation for a response. Just systemically, the geopolitical landscape as it stood before this war was going to prevent Russia from ever achieving ""great power"" status again. To do so he needs to upend the post WWII order and reinstitute ""might makes right"" as a viable geopolitical approach to maximize the leverage their nuclear arsenal can provide.

Germany is a continental power and focuses its spending on that. It however has fairly little to show for it due to decades of misspending and mismanagement.

&gt; Russia has invaded Ukraine, and some folks are arguing that Ukraine could’ve deterred Russia “if it had never given up nuclear weapons.”

&gt; But they never “had” nuclear weapons. Jeffrey and Aaron talk through the control of nuclear weapons in Ukraine during the Cold War, and the “return” of those weapons to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The Arms Control Wonk podcast is a more relaxed and free form of expression for experts who dedicate themselves full time to the study and tracking of nuclear weapons and arms proliferation.

a) Much of the mobilized troops, as well as local volunteers lack military training and sending them straight to battle would just inhibit their own fighting force (getting wounded requires evacuation, medical supplies etc). So instead they are a1) those that have some basic training are trained so they could be used as reinforcements for existing units and a2) used for rear-area duties, which allows some marginal reinforcements on the line, but only to a small degree.

b) Even those volunteers/mobilised troops with experience can't be just formed into a bran new unit. A new unit would require a new hierarchy, officers and NCOs, a ton of supporting elements, then this unit wold have to train, train and train to be a functioning military unit. So experienced troops are sent as reinforcements to exisiting units, so as to retain experience and conserve officer corps.

c) There is a lack of weapons and military supplies, and it does not make sense to send guys equipped with nothing but a 40 year old gun into battle. Sure he can be on guard duty, but this is not a fighting capable force. Especially for offensive actions.

d) There is a lack of ammunition. War eats through ammunition and most nations are extremely limited on that. The war has already been going for 2 weeks.

Honestly we're doing a fair bit as it is, we clearly crossed the line of neutrality.

The issue is: we originally expected russia to achieve operational success within the first few days like they had in 2014, even after we spent the last 7+ years training them to be a competent army.

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"Except financial corruption seems to be the handmaiden of autocrats.  Getting and keeping a collection of local cronies and minor officials rich via state authority seems to be a pretty common means of tamping down dissent among elites.  Drawing a line on military logistics corruption seems like it creates winners and losers in the local corruption scene, which could be potentially destabilizing in terms of elite loyalty.

Even if there was some genuine attempt at addressing military logistics corruption, I guess I wonder how they even start figuring it out.  You can conduct audits for larger items (gee, do I really have this many APCs, tanks, etc) but a lot of stuff will defy auditing, either because you can't realistically count all the widgets or there's just no reliable reference figure for how many widgets you actually have.  I don't really know how you find, say, fuel theft after the fact.

And a lot of corruption isn't ""we paid for 100,000 widgets, but only got 50,000"", its suppliers charging for MILSPEC quality but delivering Alibaba quality and skimming the difference.  It's a lot tougher to audit for tires that fall apart after 500 km, especially when your army doesn't have the budget to drive its vehicles enough to see the defects until they put them in war service.

And crackdowns on military logistics fraud often just leads to better fraud.  I'd argue the low hanging fruit (invoiced for X, only got Y, etc) mostly doesn't exist because the fraud is already fairly sophisticated and hard to catch.  A base commander selling fuel out the back gate might be savvy enough to keep his fuel theft at some number that looks like some reasonable level of vehicle use/training.  Plus a lot probably really is quality related.

It might be possible to just put the screws to the cronies running military logistics suppliers to make sure they're not getting too rich, but this kind of makes all the cronies nervous and can lead to destabilization among the elites.

There's probably a pretty funny comedy to be made about a war between two corrupt dictatorships that turns into an epic failure on both sides when their military equipment all turns out to be garbage and they can't even fight.",88d0bff1920b54344c28a8b408b6d950ef199b5b,True,False,,,,,0,1646827328,,0,{},hzynvui,False,t3_t9ksvp,False,True,t1_hzxwlwn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9ksvp/russian_militarys_corruption_quagmire_bogged_down/hzynvui/,1646827341,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646798528.0,,

Ukrainian forces began to withdraw from Debaltseve in the early morning on 18 February.\[99\]\[100\]\[101\] Prior to the withdrawal, about \*\*6,000 soldiers\*\* had been holed up in the city.  
...  
They abandoned their heavy weaponry, and destroyed their ammunition so as to prevent it from falling into separatist hands.\[103\]\[104\] After loading, the column of about \*\*2,000 men\*\*, including tanks and other armoured vehicles, began to proceed away from the city.\[99\] Headlamps were kept off to avoid attracting the separatist attention. In spite of these preparations, the convoy was swiftly attacked by the separatist forces. Vehicles broke down and crashed, with fire raining down on the convoy from all sides. One soldier said that the separatists were ""shooting with tanks, rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles"", and that the column had been ""disintegrated"".  
...  
Some soldiers said that ""they had actually been told to stay put"", and that they had been ""left to die in a trap"".\[108\] They said that the Ukrainian government and media repeated ""lies"" about the status of Debaltseve, and that Ukrainian forces had been surrounded for more than a week.

I don't know if you've ever been in an armored engagement, even as part of a training exercise.  But they are loud.  The cracks of tank rifles literally echo off hills and treelines for miles and the roar of diesel engines and the grinding creak of tracks is also audible for quite a ways.

Contacts fought between such mech/armor forces tend to be short, sharp and brutal as terrain changes hands multiple times with massive attrition as forces use all manner of supporting/combined arms/terrain and constant pressure to keep pushing as deep as they can across open kill zones to the next controlling terrain feature (as LOS break/traffic choke/defense line), before they lose too many vehicles to continue.

Where this 'fight until you can't' process is successfully prosecuted to it's maximum depth, that terrain (and everything behind it) belongs to the victor, even if all's that marks the 'occupation' is burnt out hulks of dead vehicles.

And a new unit rapidly passes through the combat ineffective one's last point of advance, often taking their logistics, to help sustain the tempo as a continued attack, furthering the breakout into an open-terrain exploitation phase.

All the while, artillery is moving up and down the main AAs and also along any adjacent, dominating terrain or transverse approach roads which might be used to bring up reinforcements to halt the spearhead formation.

Bluntly:  You know it when there is an armored force contesting for a given chunk of ground.  Even if you're living in the next (several) counties over.

Heard anything like that being reported out of Eastern Ukraine?  Seen any UNIT ID TAGS attached to the empty and static 'red sliver' terrain chunks which the mass media continues to delude you into believing is the extent of Russian advance/occupation/area of control, simply because they don't include 'cities taken' as casualty sinkholes?  
A thrust line must have a global unit ID (division or army group) attached, to which all subordinate units are associated and attrited.

Or it is meaningless.

It must have shaders of transparency as an indication of 'this is where our last good intel placed them for sure' and 'this is where we think they are going'.

Seen any of this?

My assessment is that the Ukrainians don't have any armor to lose.  Particularly since the one (17th ABr) Brigade they have which is nominally active duty is, fighting MULTIPLE DIVISION SIZED FORMATIONS with 3-4 Brigades each.

And started out the war home stationed in a city, Dnipropetrovsk, which is nearly at the exact center of the Eastern half of the country, midway between the Kyiv and Donetsk.  Thus should have been deployed NORTH WEST, to guard the capital as a block force to any attempted encirclement.

  
From before the very first crossing of the border.

You don't have to believe me.  But that is my assessment.  We are being led by the nose into WWIII by idiot, bored, elites who want to 'Great Reset' us, back to the early iron age.

And so ask you to believe there is an active fight going on as an actual country named Ukraine to save.

I particularly recommend 'West's Loss, China's Gain' and 'Russia Encircles Donbass' as start points.  The man doesn't claim to be a military expert but he has friends on both sides of the line who have kept him informed as to what is really happening over there.  Namely the reason Russia is 'failing' to take cities is that it is easier to leave them as fully functional administrative centers in charge of the local population, not turning off power or even telecomms and generally leaving well enough alone because they \_do not want\_ to be bogged down by occupational duties.

All of which is relevant to the nature of 'encirclement' and the realities of what is actually happening in the East of Ukraine.  Where the destruction of the enemy fielded forces is the COG of the moment.  The objective reality.  Not a political decapitation.  Not yet. 

From the Ukrainian side, things are equally not as they seem.  As you might suspect, from a professional ZSU military force who is seemingly choosing to fight the 8th Russian Combined Arms Army in the South and South East of the country.  An action which has placed them 250nm from the Capital of Kyiv which has another division, at least, on it's very doorstep.

I would not fight for Separatist border region if my Capital was under attack.  I would not allow the units around Kharkiv to maneuver south, cutting me off from the Dnieper River as the one terrain obstacle which could give me a secure flank to rapidly head north from Cherkasy or Dnipropetrovsk, once I crossed over it.

Indeed, the only sighting I have seen of 'Ukrainian Armor' has been a single incident, early on, where a reporter bulled his way past the Russian border guards in Crimea, only to end up with an equivalent Ukrainian unit with ONE wheeled APC (BTR-80?) that that was rapidly digging in.

This reporter got the unit commander to say all kinds of stupid things while pan and scanning the whole unit position and \_describing\_ distances to the border checkpoint he had just left, as the Ukrainians rapidly shoveled themselves into individual fighting positions and he even got to see the interior of the APC.

It would have been laughable if it was not so tragically incompetent.

According to Wiki, in 2008 there were the following mechanized forces-

\&gt;  
17th Armor Brigade.  
53rd Mechanized Brigade.  
54th Mechanized Brigade.   
92nd Mechanized Brigade.  
93rd Mechanized Brigade.  
\&gt;

Ukrainian Ground Forces - Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian\_Ground\_Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Ground_Forces))  


Formed into two divisions, six brigades, and one independent regiment.  I don't know if these are shadow formations with multiple unit identities, mixed formations with other infantry/mountain troops to be activated at regional need.  Or simply 'equivalents' in terms of underlying command and control and force structure, ready to activate and be attached to whoever, on callup of trained conscripts.

But whatever; there is a clear discrepancy between the representative units and the subordinate forces that can be assigned to them. 

Nonetheless, all mechanized and armored formations in Ukraine are presently called brigades (nominally 3-5,000 assigned personnel in 2-3 Battalions). 

And so we head to a separate section on ZSU Armored/Mech formations where, as of 2020, those forces have been reduced to-

\&gt;  
\* 1st Tank Brigade (Reserve), formed 2016\[2\]   
\* 4th Tank Brigade (Reserve), formed 2017\[4\]   
\* 5th Tank Brigade (Reserve), formed 2016\[5\]

To me it seems what has happened is that the Polish do not want to assume the risk of angering Russia by launching the MiGs out of their own airbases, or were tired of US diplomatic posturing and has thus come out and announced this unilaterally to force the American's hand.

The Americans have promptly refused it.

This begs the question: WHY??? Why is it that, after 10 days of huge losses and sheer incompetence, NATO countries are still absolutely terrified of Russia? There has been a much more egregious precedent before: Soviet pilots during the Korean War. And yet NATO can't even send a bunch of old 3rd hand jets without fear of angering a decrepit bear missing one of its legs?

To me this is either a psyop and the jets are already there, or Biden actually really gives absolutely 0 shits about what happens in Ukraine but is doing the barest minimum to not be seen as weak by the public; give weapons which are barely 1% of the annual defense budget, share intelligence so Ukraine lasts longer than Afghanistan and call it a day for the midterms.

Or can someone convince me of the methods to this madness?",7b1a3b0878ffa04555ff75c7fe47c02440530e2e,True,False,,,,,0,1646822138,,0,{},hzyh1pu,False,t3_t9qpa3,False,True,t3_t9qpa3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9qpa3/poland_has_agreed_to_transfer_all_mig29_fighter/hzyh1pu/,1646822151,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646793338.0,,

There is ONE ACTIVE BRIGADE.  And a whole bunch of ‘reserve’ formations.  Which to me sounds like a bunch of chewed up units from 2014, which reconstituted as hollow formations with different names.  And no TOE.  
This is the kind of crap that Hitler pulled.  To make it seem like Germany was generating divisions it did not have (while actually starving veteran units of replacement weapons, materiel and troops).  
CONCLUSION:  
Are you even sure, with the utter abyss of information not coming out of the Ukrainian East, where supposedly ZSU forces are 'heavily engaged' with Russian armored formations of the 8th Combined Arms Army, around Donbass, while abandoning the Capital, undefended, some 250nm to the Northwest, to another division sized element; that there -is- an armed force in Ukraine to train/save/send advanced ATGW to?

At what point in a conflict does one start pulling experience veterans back to start training new recruits?  
\&gt;&gt;

When the unit is destroyed beyond reconstitution.  When the soldier is a danger to himself or to others but still wants to be useful.  When a particular degree of skill is shown that needs to be included into cadre.  When that particular warrior is so successful that his loss represents more of a propaganda/morale issue than his continued contribution at the front line.

If the warfighter is smart, the first thing they will do is teach humility to constant learning.  From whoever has useful knowledget to contribute.  So that there will always be 'take a knee on me', field level, clobber colleges.  In which senior officers will give a quick briefing on what has changed and then there will be a table with a NCO delivered direct course on a new trick or system or tactic.

When that (enemy or friendly) system is understood, there may be a brief field problem.  And then you're done.  All within 10-20km of the front.  All within 45 to 120 minutes of 'training'.  And you're competent because /all the other things/ about battle kind of contain this new variable within it's own unique place as danger point or opportunity.

You cannot replace that global experience level, quickly.

At the same time, the relevance of any one TTP is incredibly perishable.  Because AIT tactics which are oriented around pushing out a bunch of uniformly capable soldiers that do things a particular way as plug'n'play units of force are often dated if not outright deadly, within days of beginning operations in the field.

Because the enemy reads your playbook, while rewriting his own, too.

If you are doing an occupation mission like IFOR or ISAF (or any kind of COIN/stabilization mission where there are long periods of static lines and limited fighting but a lot of small unit actions) the need for these individualized theater courses is exceptionally high.  Because, 'NATO standards' be hanged, everyone is operating to different levels of recruit/conscript  quality and training.

In a condition like Ukraine, there flatly isn't time for a lot of fancyness as people without even a basic level of tactical understanding cannot do that 'in the battlespace, it means this' quick reduction.

By the time you are issuing rifles to civilians, you are down to unit lifespans measured in hours and it is typically not even worth leavening them up with experienced NCOs as platoon leaders.  You put them where they are least likely to be challenged so that you can keep your primary, experienced, forces in play, elsewhere.  They will be led by school teachers or old cops or similar civil servants whose primary quality is loyalty to the chain of command.

Within this perspective, people have an understandable but still highly misinformed comprehension of the 'Every citizen a Warrior!  Slava Ukraini!' real meaning.  Because they want to see themselves transposed into that everyman hero they see on TV and the fact that they don't wear a uniform or have minimal seasoning if they do, only reinforces that identity shift.

If you cannot fire and maneuver within the flow of battle, you will be put into a situation (you never should have entered/stayed) whereby you will be pointing your rifle down a street from an improvised position and the UAV you may not even see will call down artillery on you and you will die.

Simply because you are doing the best you can.

Your nominal commander will be saddened for a second and disappointed for an hour, because he knows that if he had assigned that position to a veteran unit with the idea of 'secure this intersection', they would have known he \_did not mean\_ by standing on it.

You secure forward with patrols and OPs.  You have a series of tripwire fire teams which tell you which direction in what seriousness a threat is coming and then you push your primary force to positions to attrite that threat either in passant as some form of ambush lane.  Or with a serious base of fire and counter maneuver plan to eliminate it on approach.

Your purpose is to buy time, while heavier forces are shifted around to support you or engage the threat somewhere else after failing it's probing attack on your position.  And you are operating down to section elements of 2-4 people.  Just to keep your terrain occupation footprint low.

This does not mean you get to be lazy and just sit there and chat.  This does not mean you get to stop keeping your weapon and your body clean.  Reporting in and accepting new mission updates and directive orders.  This does not mean you forget to grab some food and establish some kind of watch schedule.

ALL of these ordinary Field Discipline things, the typical civilian will find to be a blur of meaningless activity and with barely understood reasoning.  The more advanced operational theory will simply be beyond them.  They will normally not even see it because it's a matter of prediction, not mimicry.  Or you are dead.

Keep this in mind when you recall that, in 1991, the Ukrainians had 780,000 men under arms, 7,000 AFV, 6,000 MBT and 900-1,200 aircraft, along with 2,500 nukes.  Which they promptly ('Lord Of War') sold off as fast as their corrupt leaders could manage.

Where the chance of conflict being a quick and almost bloodless thunder run ending in regime change and a puppet government that they could at least try to spin and pretend was the “true” government.  Now that the PRC sees it was not a chance of a conflict, but a promise of a conflict.  They see the nature of the conflict itself is vastly different than what they were told.  They see Russia’s backing / support on contentious international issues become rapidly far less valuable.

The PRC is slowly backing away, but they are not going to turn down cheap and reliable sources of energy.  Even the EU is having a hard time doing that right now…  The energy deal was not about Ukraine’s natural resources, Russia has enough of it’s own to sell he PRC for it even before everyone else embargoes them.

[],False,,rabidwombat,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mxpc,False,True,"I'm hoping someone with hands-on experience will be able to weigh in here, but here are a couple of observations from an external observer. There's a fair amount of (mainly US) literature available [1] that goes into detail. Different equipment, obviously, but the fundamentals probably aren't all that different. If you dig, you'll find a bunch of public documents detailing the evolution of tank maintenance and logistics from WWII and Vietnam through to close to present day. While a lot has changed and modernized, quite a lot hasn't.

* I'm not sure what the ratio _should_ be for Russian tanks in Ukraine but I'd be surprised if it'd be anywhere more positive than 1:4 or 1:5 of operational to maintenance time. FWIW, I can't imagine the navy is any less demanding - your stuff is immersed in corrosive fluid a lot more than a MBT after all :)
* In terms of manpower, you'll have roughly as many additional technical support as tank crew, but that sits on top of the entire supply chain. Also, bear in mind that tank crews can do quite a lot of maintenance work themselves. They don't drop it off at the motor pool, bleep the remote, and come back in the morning :) And of course military mechanics in general are trained on many different platforms, and platforms are designed with maintenance in mind. There are probably a lot fewer narrow specialists than laymen might expect, though it'll vary a lot between branches. Not everyone has a multidisciplinary crew like a submarine.
* If your tank is sitting around for 8 hours doing nothing while the crew sleeps, you've run out of mechanics or lost them somewhere. The motor pool has to move with the front line, or the front line will stall and then retreat or fail [2]. So right behind the tank is a very long supply chain of support, comprising fuel, spares, blokes with spanners, ammo, food, water...and it's stretching from your FOB all the way home. When I hear about convoys of vehicles stretching to the horizon, my first mental image is trucks not tanks.
* If you're doing combat maintenance on one tank at a time, you either really suck at logistics or are actively losing a war, or both. Economies of scale and efficiency really do matter, and you want to have a pool of active maintenance working on, say, 10-20%+ of deployed vehicles at a time, doing MUCH more rolling maintenance than fixing breakage. Russia has deployed a LOT of assets, so their maintenance capability should have scaled accordingly. Apparently it'd didn't, so stuff is falling apart. Logistics wins wars, right?
* Maintenance and replacement windows are often surprisingly short. Tanks may look indestructible, but just repairing and replacing the treads and links is a constant fight against entropy - those things really don't last long at all. A few hundred klicks, maybe a thousand at the outside? Not much more, though it'd depend on the terrain. Which means that your ""10 day incursion"" is important context - stuff will be properly falling apart well before the end of that time if you've left your logistics behind.
* Tanks are very mobile. The situation is different for artillery, say, where the hard work may be done while it's dug in so I'd guess that recovering a damaged tank from contested terrain is usually simply not worth doing, which is why we see abandoned equipment being towed away by farmers with tractors. Though if anyone can cite doctrine around command-level triage for that sort of thing, I'd LOVE to hear it, because I really don't know.

Maintenance of a reserve is one of the most essential things a commander can do.

Of that 2 million, you need to take out: 

* \-Air Force / Navy / Strategic rocket forces
* \- Students of Military Schools and basic training and instructors of said institutions. 
* \- Personnel employed by the armed forces, who are employed outside of said force
* \- Personnel who work on the Ministry of National Defense or equivalent.
* \- Sick, temporarly unfit and personnel who are currently non-deployable.
* Personnel who are employed in non-deployable roles, for example district headquarters, and other static roles.
* Personnel who are working in joint force assignments assigned to other branches of service.
* Personnel deployed on other standing operations.

Once you remove that, and then start looking once again, it becomes a much smaller number of available field forces.  


Even that number gets reduced as you do need to maintain a certain amount of reserve forces for in area and out of area contingencies, as well as replacement troops to relieve said field force.  200,000 is actually quite a high number of available forces when you think about it. 

The lump-of-labour fallacy also comes into play. You don't need 200,000 bodies, that number becomes reduced by the amount of specialists and other technical occupations you need to deploy. So the percentage of certain personnel might be higher. (For example, only 5% of the infantry sergeants in the Russian army are deployed, but 75% of the geomatics intelligence Lieutenants and 90% of the Postal Sergeants.....)

For example, the Canadian forces of 60,000 regulars and 20,000 reservists struggled heavily to sustain a 2000 person deployment to Afghanistan. Just to sustain a small deployment of that size (Around 10% of Land Forces Command) was bleeding a lot of other units dry.   


The problem is, a lot of military analysts really think in *peacetime* thinking. That any training or deployment, or manning will be done to peacetime standards (For example to my above point of the CF, a 12-18 month road to high readiness and pre-deployment training period prior to a 6 month deployment), rather than a reduced level or reduced standards that are more apt for ""wartime"".

Oddly enough, the logistics of mechanized warfare wouldn't be too foreign to any historical general from a society whose armies were built around heavy cavalry. Mechanized units and heavy cavalry have basically the same logistics concerns. You need a relatively large, steady supply of fuel/fodder on campaign. You can't rely on foraging to meet your supply requirement - both AFVs and warhorses are hungry beasts. 

So you need to bring along trucks/carts full of fuel/fodder. Your logistics train itself consumes fuel/fodder, so it needs to bring even more fuel/fodder to move itself along. The farther you travel from friendly territory, the more supply convoys you need to arrange, and because you're outside friendly territory those convoys are vulnerable and need protection.

Allowing nuclear weapons to be used to compel non-nuclear states will shred the Non-Proliferation Treaty to bits, as every state will seek to build its own nuclear capability to deter nuclear blackmail and advance its own policy goals. 

Because strategic nuclear war is very bad for everyone involved, ultimately I don't think any state will be able to fully trust an ally's ""nuclear umbrella""; there's just too much risk that the protector state will make precisely the observation you just did - that ""winning"" a strategic nuclear war is a worse outcome than conceding whatever political point is in question, so it's better to dishonor the alliance.

History tells us that states misjudge the situation and make poor strategic decisions *all the time*. Each attempt at nuclear blackmail carries a real risk of unintentionally escalating to nuclear war.

To make matters worse, great powers may have incentives to *encourage* a nuclear exchange between other great powers. (If you're thinking ""but nuclear winter"", hold that thought, and see the end of this comment for details.)

Given all of this, the most responsible option is to try really hard to maintain the current consensus ""rules"" about nuclear weapons by doing our utmost, by conventional means, to ensure that Russia's nuclear blackmail is not profitable. 

---

On nuclear winter:

I think most people have an image of a strategic nuclear exchange between the US and Russia as ""nuclear apocalypse, everyone dies"", and they base their thoughts about nuclear warfare on that image. That image, however deeply embedded it is in pop culture, is *wrong*. It comes from the 1983 TTAPS model, which is widely agreed to have been much too pessimistic. The most recent modeling suggests that nuclear winter will be bad, but not *that* bad. It ranges from ""not *that* bad,  but still pretty damn bad"" to ""moderately bad"".

In terms of effects on countries that weren't bombed, by the least optimistic models the effects might be comparable to China's Great Leap Forward - massive famines and starvation, certainly not optimal, but hardly apocalyptic either. 

Meanwhile, the effects on countries that were bombed *are* pretty close to apocalyptic - they won't be doing anything meaningful on the world stage for a long time. 

So if you're Xi Jinping, and your analysis tells you that a strategic nuclear war is statistically likely to happen, you'd really like to make sure that strategic nuclear war is between the US and Russia, leaving China as the *de facto* hegemon. Yes, famine sucks, but the elites will be fine, the elites are the ones making these decisions, and the elites will come out the other side in a better position than where they started, relatively speaking.

Also, there is going to be some counter attack by the Ukrainians. They are not going to leave a lot of their forces in the west because they demonstrated that cities can hold off a really long time. So they can engage the Russians in the countryside. And I suspect they will try to do that to end this war.

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,True,"TBH, I think your comment belong in /r/NonCrediblePolitics more than anything else. Some very naive calculations about the cost of modern war and the geo-politics of aggression against a sovereign state.

&gt;There should be a /r/NonCrediblePolitics for these folks to post in, because Putin is still being fed billions every week from O&amp;G products by Europeans (some 150 million a day in propane/natural gas alone), to say nothing of their Asian and Middle-east incomes. That's enough money to pay every soldier deployed ten times their monthly salary every single day.

If Russia was in a position where they couldn't pay their deployed soldiers, then they wouldn't be invading in the first place. Sanctions against Russia are about far more than the lost revenues from trading, it's also the vulnerability of the Russian banking and economic system. Most credit rating agencies are predicting a default of the Russian state before summer, not to mention more pressing solvency issues with Russia's largest firms in the near-term future. Russia is vulnerable because while they (attempt to) align with Beijing geo-politically, their economic model is still western, and as a result is dependent on the western global economy.

Despite what multipolar-enthusiasts have to say, there is no question that modern finance and trade runs through NYC, London, and Bern. Moscow is now unable to do business in those places. The world's best reserve currencies are the Dollar and Euro, and Russia can't use what they have and cannot get much more. Expelling the Russians from SWIFT would have been enough to hurt the Russian banking sector, but the blocking sanctions on the Russian central bank are the real killer. Russia's currency is depreciating, their export sector is crumbling (even in gas, which is not eliminated but restricted), and the government is unable to engage in any meaningful fiscal or monetary policy outside of amassing large quantities of physical gold, which is not a workable long term solution.

Income from oil and gas is a pittance compared to that. Asian and ME incomes are also not enough to cover that. You don't just lose your biggest trading partner overnight and keep sailing along, especially when your central bank is targeted like this. Russia can continue to prosecute the war, but if they continue to do so for more than a month or two, the economic damage will set them back 50 years.

I've spoken to people who specialize in global trade and economics about this and they all seem to have the same conclusion that Russia is in deep trouble. Entire sectors of their economy will be essentially vaporized.

&gt;Once Putin begins seizing the natural resources of Ukraine, emptying the bank accounts of Ukranians and selling Ukranian gas too, he won't even need to worry about European income.

This sounds exactly like the people who argued that the Iraq War would pay for itself once we took all of Iraq's oil. 

First, there is the international law problem of pirating a sovereign nation's natural resources, which would be a war crime. It might not stop China and ME countries from purchasing, but it may give them pause, either from a moral perspective, or simply weighing the risks of accepting blood resources and damaging trade relations with the west, which is where China and the ME actually make all their money.

As an aside, if Putin's long term aim is to align Kyiv with Moscow, stealing all their natural resources at the point of a gun is a great way to ensure his long-term vision is made impossible forever.

Secondly, how is Putin going to get these resources out of the ground and through manufacturing? The Ukrainian work force is not going to return to their jobs in an occupied country. If Russia forces them to it will only result in industrial sabotage and fuel and insurgency. Russia can't import enough labor to make a meaningful dent in that.

Third, assuming that problems #1 and #2 are figured out, Russia is going to need to spend the money to actually rebuild all of the infrastructure their invasion is destroying before they can make a meaningful profit. Their indiscriminate bombing of civilians areas means they will inherit nothing but ruins, and it's going to take years to build back Ukrainian industry to pre-war levels, and Russia does not have the capital nor the willpower to spend that money.

There are another billion arguments on this topic. The idea that Russia will see any significant income from occupying a destroyed Ukraine is laughable. It's magical thinking math on par with the Bush White House and if anyone in the Kremlin is seriously banking on pirating Ukraine to pay for the war, they are not going to have their jobs for long.

As for draining the bank accounts of Ukrainians, what in the world do you think that will do? Nobody in Ukraine with significant wealth has their money tied up in Kyiv banks, as in Russia. The Ukrainian government doesn't keep their reserves in Ukraine. Moreover , if Putin decides to literally just rob Ukrainians of the money they have, assuming that Ukrainian banks actually give the money over, what is that going to do? It's not enough money to solve Russia's problems and now you have 40 million starving people with no money, because Russia just took all their money. How do you think that is going to play out?

I really think a lot of your comments betray that you have no understanding of banking or finance in even a lay capacity. 

&gt;Russia's economy has been damaged, sure. But Russia is not a dictatorship, not a democracy, and Putin's personal economic and financial income is still operational and capable of funding this and future wars.

Even assuming that all of your above points are correct, which they are not, the biggest cost for Russia is going to be in human lives. So far they have, by even the most conservative estimates, 2,000 killed in Ukraine. They have lost a ton of material as well. Committing to a long-term occupation in Ukraine would mean fighting an insurgency with no natural local collaborators, while the insurgents would be funded, equipped, and trained by western militaries. It would be like Afghanistan on steroids. Russia would suffer thousands dead every year, and they would probably need double or triple the number of troops they currently have to effectively occupy the country. And that is assuming they could even maintain law and order in the face of massive protests, which we've seen on a smaller scale in Kherson and Melitopol and would be overwhelmingly large in Kyiv.

If you take the view that Russia is a dictatorship, and that none of this will shake the foundation of Putin's government, then you still have to account for the absolute sink of blood and treasure Russia will lose in Ukraine over 10, 15, 20 years. Russia will not be able to prosecute future wars effectively (if they even choose to fight them), and will devote an ever increasing portion of their military budget on the attrition and operation cost of the occupation. Russia would be tied up, essentially, and that is not something Putin wants.

Take into account what 15,000 or 20,000 Russian casualties in the span of 2022 alone could have in Russian society, and I think you have to concede that Putin's grip on power is not absolute.

&gt;Um, sure. If that happens, and if Ukraine still wants to join after seeing that NATO refused to directly fight on its behalf, and if NATO wants to take Ukraine in, go for it.

Don't see why Ukraine wouldn't. Baltic states are more vulnerable than Ukraine, but it was Ukraine that was attacked. Not hard to see why.

In a vacuum, nukes will always offer security benefits to any nation. The reason we don't see greater proliferation is not because countries don't know it can bolster their position, it's because the number of other factors that encumber that and otherwise undermine their position. The material and (geo)political costs, the fact that unfriendly nations (or just great powers not keen on proliferation) will be heavily incentivized to deal with you while you are in the process of nuclearization, the fact that (if you're a US ally particularly) you may already enjoy the protection of a nuclear umbrella. And the fact that a small nuclear arsenal- the only kind the vast majority of nations could build and sustain- is not necessarily enough to bring about the same MAD considerations, and so may serve as an effective guarantor of your security but might not do much for you otherwise (see: North Korea).
