 One of the main reasons for Russia attacking Ukraine was (per Putin) the reintegration of the

 He pretty much failed that in Ukraine,  or in all of Ukraine,  but he might succeed in Russia, though, ironnically, not as he envisioned it, by a nationalistic ""rebirth"" and conquest

 He might do it indirectly, by sanctions, sanctions that must be so brutal, so long lasting, and so devastating that, combined with their nationalistic/imperialistic tendencies, would scar the russian population so much that they will never, ever want to eat the proverbial McBurger again - also known as permanent decoupling.So he will escalate.

 Now enter China,  who has one critical, giant advantage over the West - the Chinese don't want you to become a Chinese. They don't require it.

The actual on-the-ground Russian troop presence isn't *that* big, certainly not so big that it would have to be reduce to send soldiers to Ukraine. While there has been a decrease in Russian air activity since the start of the war in Ukraine, there are still regular air patrols, even if not airstrikes. The Russian air (not ground) presence is quantitatively lower, but it does not qualitatively effect the risk-calculations of the major actors in the conflict.

Since you talk about the rebels, I think it is worth looking at them. You can divide the rebels on the ground in Syria into three main groups: the al-Tanf rebels, Maghawir al-Thawra (MaT), Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Idlib, and the Syrian National Army (SNA) in Afrin, Tel Abyad, and Serekaniye. 

The first group, MaT, are very small and not capable of offensive operations. There are only a few hundred of them, and they serve more to smokescreen what is, in effect, a US occupation of the al-Tanf border crossing to make Iranian resupplying of Syria more costly and less efficient. Many are involved in drug smuggling and some even defected to the SAA a few years back: in short, they cannot do anything regardless.

The second group we will look at is the SNA. They are, in effect, proxies of Turkey. The SNA is a disorganised, structurally incoherent collection of various rebel groups of different ideology, local origin, and background, ranging from localist Turkmen militias to hardened Salafi-Jihadists. These groups constantly infight, have no coherent central organisation, are not regarded as very competent by themselves, and are more known for their looting, division, and crimes against locals than for their fighting. That is to say they have no independent offensive capabilities. They only control these areas of land because they are under strict Turkish protection, and research on the SNA indicates that the Turkish military controls all major strategic decisions. Turkish Armed Forces and intelligence operatives are embedded at every level of the SNA. Turkey has no interest in restarting a conflict with the Syrian government, nor a conflict with Russia, because doing so would risk refugee flow into Turkey, would risk its 'special relationship' with Russia, and wouldn't achieve any wider strategic aim for Turkey. The main purpose of the SNA is to fight the SDF for Turkey while Turkey provides heavy armoured and air support. The SDF is still under the protection of the US and Russia, and even if Russia left, the US would likely fill in the gap given the Biden administration's friendliness towards the SDF + Biden's personal animosity towards Erdogan.

Finally, we come to HTS. HTS is the only rebel group with any real offensive capacity or any degree of independence from external actors. However, they only have 15,000-35,000 soldiers which is not enough to succeed in any meaningful offensive abilities other than a few villages. The SAA, while not particularly competent, has enough firepower and men to stop it. HTS is also reliant on Turkish protection, and Turkey's interests are in upholding the status quo in Idlib. It gains nothing from HTS gaining a few more towns, and then likely facing an SAA counter-attack which would send refugees into Turkey. As long as there is land for Turkey to settle refugees, particularly when doing so replaces ethnically cleansed former Kurdish,Christian, and Yazidi demographics as in SNA-controlled areas, and as long as the land is not controlled by the SDF, then Turkey is happy to maintain things as they are.

In summary, then, it's not likely to have any impact on the operational side of the war in terms of rebel offensives.

Where it may have an impact is in worsening Syria's absolutely destroyed economy because of its semi-reliance on Russian trade, reconstruction contracts, and food imports. This will likely exacerbate tensions in areas currently engaging in direct action against the regime such as in Al-Suwayda and in Daraa. The former is particularly important given the Druze community's strategic position in the heights overlooking Damascus, but historically the government has not treated them as harshly as they have other protestors, so an actual armed rebellion there is very unlikely.",3bca6cc71556adc94917a1e6da2bb543dcdb5efc,True,False,,,,,0,1648580708,,0,{},i2lnw1e,False,t3_tqwrnh,False,True,t3_tqwrnh,/r/geopolitics/comments/tqwrnh/how_will_the_syrian_civil_war_be_affected_by_the/i2lnw1e/,1648580879,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648551908.0,,

If TB2s actually decimate the Russian army, the invasion would be over a week ago at least. If TB2s were actually the top-notch of military technology (as Turkish media claims), NATO would fully incorporate them in their ranks, thus giving an epilogue (good ending) to Turkey's diplomatic isolation policy.

Now, even though Turkey sold TB2s to Ukraine and even though Ukraine thanks them for their aid to send a message to Russia,  the Turkish foreign minister and president urged to correct these statements, downgrading it as ""just business"", as your last link confirms.

Having these in mind, I think Turkey will keep balancing itself between NATO and Russia. I don't believe that Turkey will let this minor inconvinience have ramifications for the Russo-Turkish relations. Turkey has a lot to win from Russian oligarchs and oil/gas sales, since [they don't seem to be willing to put sanctions against them](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/will-turkey-become-haven-sanctioned-russians). This is not the first time that Turkey does such business. Back in 2019, they [did the same with Iran](https://www.voanews.com/a/europe_erdogan-defies-trump-over-iran-sanctions/6176609.html).  Their gains were immense and the trial of [Halkbank](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-says-turkeys-halkbank-can-be-prosecuted-over-iran-sanction-2021-10-22/) was about to happen to actually punish Turkey for this ""insolence"". Yet, we see right now that the tides have turned and [the trial is put on hold](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/turkeys-halkbank-shares-jump-after-us-prosecution-put-hold-2022-01-17/), which leaves Turkey unpunished and at the same time, this is perceived as weakness of the West, in the Turkish mindset. The same will happen again. Turkey will prove useful somewhere and NATO will forgive again Turkey for not putting sanctions on Russia. The Turkish government is aware of that, which is why they can push things far enough. Somehow, the west keeps falling for Turkey's plays everytime. They still trust that the Turkish opposition will shift things but I doubt it would be so (analysis on another post maybe).

Anyway, if Russo-Turkish relations didn't deter when Turkey took down their pilot, an ambassador was murdered, their troops almost clashed in Syria, they clashed in Libya, it won't happen now. Turkey sees Russia as a huge wallet and will do anything to protect that wallet, while Russia sees Turkey as a ""Trojan Horse"" useful, for laying siege to the west without bloodshed.

And we, westerners, sit in our comfortable chairs, and clap our hands because we sanctioned Russia, as if we caught Putin by surprise. If anything, these articles you posted show our pathetic mentality and fruitless hopes that authoritarian regimes like Turkey, will take the side of the West. I swear, if Hungary wasn't part of the EU it wouldn't impose any sanctions too.

Also unlike Russia the USA bombed Iraqs army to the moon before launching the attack.

While the Iraq enviroment is good for terrorism or insurgencies it is horrible for armys that have to fight conventionally because the army with better technology will win by default. Tank combat is literally decided by shooting range alone because any other factors are not relevant in the desert. 

Iraq and Ukraine can not be compared on a geographical point. The US army only had to basically drive down two roads to capture Iraq and destroy their army....Russia has a frontline the size of Texas against Ukraine

Of course there had to have been a motive, because even Putin wouldn't just roll into a country with no pretext, but I never realized exactly how muddy that was. 

To the second point, I appreciate the clarification. I understand that Russia has it's naval fleet there (and I think it can be argued that it was the main pretext for the annexation), but I figured it was more of a military base type of situation. For example, the US would have no justification for invading Germany just because we have bases there. 

That being said, I do understand that Crimea, and donbas, have historical, ""ethnic,"" Russians living there, but that would be akin to Mexico invading the US due to a large Mexican population. (I know you weren't making this argument, just contextualizing it for myself).

Lastly, I remember at the time a big discussion being about the Tatar population in Crimea, which is a majority I think. Tatars are a part of the Russian federation, but are they considered to be ethnic Russians? I would imagine that being similar to Chechnyans being considered ethnic Russians due to being swallowed up by Putin in the 00s.

So let me ask you, do you condemn hate crimes against people of Chinese descent, including the purges that Suharto took that killed tens of thousands of Indonesians of Chinese descent?

&gt;""...make ship visits, to carry out logistical replenishment in..."" That is a base, bud.

You clearly didn't read my definition or you just have really bad comprehension.

I'll repost it:

""A naval base, navy base, or military port is a military base, where warships and naval ships are docked when they have no mission at sea or need to restock. Ships may also undergo repairs. Some naval bases are temporary homes to aircraft that usually stay on ships but are undergoing maintenance while the ship is in port.""

In other words, if they're simply making a pit stop, that's literally not a base. US Navy ships used to make pit stops in HK, that does not mean they had a base there. Stop making up definitions and come back to the real world.

&gt;And that is a debt trap.

That's bad in its own right but it's *not* an example of any debt trap. 

Debt trap is when ""the creditor country is said to extend excessive credit to a debtor country with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions when the debtor country becomes unable to meet its repayment obligations.""

Should China be more responsible and not lend to dictators/authoritarian countries? Yes absolutely and the fact that they're doing this is wrong. However, this is not a debt trap because the intention of trapping them with the debt is not there. 

The author of the source you are quoting (AidData) even said this if you refer to the sources I linked to in the previous comment. But no, you choose to only examine evidence that you think supports your position. Please get out of your bubble.

&gt;RCEP is an ASEAN creation to which China signed on as a plus one member. ""...led the creation and expansion..."" is something that you literally made up out of thin air.

Not true.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/RCEP-kicks-in-as-China-seeks-to-lead-regional-economic-integration

Regardless, the RCEP doesn't support your position at all because it actually helps the economies of NE Asia including China while hurting the economies of some ASEAN members (refer to source above).

&gt;ASEAN is going to be the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030 with 60 percent of its population, which in less than ten years will be larger than Europe by one or two hundred million people, under the age of 35

People keep saying this and I don't believe it. Just like people said how China is going to be the number one economy and that India would be close behind.

ASEAN is inherently, like any supranational organization, a fragile concept. Even the EU, which has a stronger identity, is fragile. I wish the best for ASEAN but for the majority of the ASEAN members, the best way forward for development is more state-led development and less liberalization. (Refer to Wades and/or HJ Chang on this matter)

&gt;rapid industrialization and modernization of infrastructure and supporting sectors of their economies,

You've just exposed how little you know about Political Economy. 

Please read up on some political economy because nothing is ever as deterministic as you put it.

I recommend Sonal Pandya, she's a great academic on developmental econ who puts things simply for lay observers.

&gt;Those people have been taken advantage of wholesale by the Chinese for years

If you're so pissed at China, why aren't you pissed at European powers? After all they've done more to ""kick the ladder"" of development out from under ASEAN countries, essentially hobbling many of their developmental efforts.

And regardless, the impact China has done is relatively minimal. Japan is a bigger financier in the region (and it was their hot money that caused the 1997 financial crisis that started in SEA, refer to Robert Wade's article on the Asian Debt and development Crisis).

&gt;Later (or sooner) they will look back and recognize what Chinese were doing in their countries all these years and they will be looking for justice and rectification. Don't act surprised and offended about it because everyone knows it's an act.

Again, you're justifying hate crimes against people of Chinese ethnicity. When will you stop? You keep saying how much you love Taiwan and hate the KMT for what they did which is a totally fair stance. But what those governments (such as Suharto) did is exactly what the KMT did except on a significantly large scale. So either you're a hypocrite or you should condemn those attacks and stop invoking racist rhetoric against people of Chinese descent, tying them with the CCP when they have little to no connection.

And sorry to burst your bubble but despite how much you want people of Chinese descent to die, the likelihood is little because people are nowadays more civilized than yourself.",527c1b2e2dac24522da44dc76bbb538bd91b2a85,True,False,,,,,0,1648567639,,0,{},i2kpebz,False,t3_tnd1w5,False,True,t1_i2j8tnp,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnd1w5/china_and_solomon_islands_draft_secret_security/i2kpebz/,1648567650,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648538839.0,,

But basically you add diversity of experience to the MBA class. Note that this is only relevant for students with substantial experience (read: 3-5+ years), not for the 22 year-old direct from undergrad SAIS students.

MBA schools are also concerned with yield (the percentage of students offered a position in the class who actually end up attending) and they know that coming from SAIS you're more likely to attend as you have less options (only ~5ish schools with dual degree partnerships to apply to) and you're already committed to the grad school route. 

And yeah, you'll do an extra year but in the end with a post MBA salary at the caliber of institutions that SAIS is partnering with, you'll be ok in the long run. Your SAIS education/experience might actually set you apart in the MBA recruiting process and get your application some additional looks too. 

Only downside (from a friend that is doing it now) is that you switch between campuses throughout the process and lose your connections with your current MBA class. Not so much as big of a deal from the SAIS perspective, but in MBA school where the network is half the value, it's more of an opportunity cost.

The Taliban offered to get rid of the group and probably would have handed OBL just for asking. The Bush admin turned them down. Well ok, so then the US wanted the Taliban gone. That all happened rapidly. They blended into the scenery and many went next door to the Pakistan border. Bush quit looking for Bin Laden and pulled many troops to invade Iraq. I have no idea what the mission was at that point. President Obama had OBL killed in Pakistan. The US should have declared victory and left. But now they had to protect ""the democracy"" and women and children until they could protect themselves. That was an endless mission. Biden realized that and pulled out - after the Taliban formally took control. They had been in control for years already.
The Iraq goals were to get rid of Saddam and WMDs which were never there. Sadam was taken down quickly - disappeared. They didn't find WMDs.The US should have left but now Iraq was in a power vacuum civil war. The US goal then changed to build a democracy and they were going bomb Iraqis until they succeeded. The we must kill them to save them strategy. President Obama pulled the troops out and left behind a fairly stable county - that's allied with Iran. The opposite of what was planned. 
USSRs Afghan invasion was to turn Afghanistan into communist client state.  Then it was to protect their installed govt against islamists. Russia wanted Afghanistan to become a permanent client state. Funny thing is, they pulled out of their permanent occupation in only 10 years. The US and it's coalition country left their temporary occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan after 20 years.
The occupations of Vietnam were to protect democracy for the west - which was a war with a false premise about a domino theory. Russia and China wanted to protect communism.

There are some crucial differences between the structures of power. There are also differences in the goals of these wars. This is territorial expansion.  It is also right next to Russia. To my knowledge, the US could never drive right up to Vietnam or Iraq. They were ""winning ugly"" by planting explosives in Laos, but they never had a Belarus equivalent by which to encircle the nation.

Diplomatically, it's massively different, too. Besides the EU being so heavily invested, which is different, too. No one wants to hear this, but Eastern Ukraine has a huge ethnic Russian minority. Many of the mayors supported counter-protests against Euromaidan in 2014. There are still many people in the structures of Ukraine's power who have Russian ties. Also, Russia was Ukraine's biggest trading partner until 2019. Many Ukrainian nationals see themselves as both ethnically Russian and Ukrainian. (See Sergii Plokhii's *Gates of Europe*.)

It's more than simply routing an army by ""winning ugly"" and planting mines, or negotiating because the US understands what it's like to underestimate your opponent. 

There are many different factors at play here. Because of the past 30 years, they are very closely intertwined countries. The challenges to ***truly*** winning are very different. It's not just about an army.

How can you compare Russia's faltering initial invasion of Ukraine with the American occupation/COIN/state-building of other wars (Iraqi Freedom, Afghanistan) or wars with different objectives (Vietnam, Gulf War)? The state-building/endgame is a separate phase after the cessation of conventional state-on-state forces. Russia is not yet at this point and might have had a plan (with pre-selected leaders for Ukraine like we've seen in some occupied cities).

Going strictly off of military capabilities, the US did what they set out to do. In Vietnam, the US was based in South Vietnam and neighboring countries attempting to prop up the South Vietnamese regime. They did this. The US did not invade the North although they mounted intense bombing campaigns. I don't think one can really compare the objectives of Vietnam with Ukraine.

Gulf War I: the US set out to remove Iraq from Kuwait. This was accomplished successfully and even had no-fly zones set up after the war. The ""hope Saddam is removed in a coup"" was a not the primary objective and the uprisings happened after hostilities ceased so that is not a valid point to compare, either. Again, not comparable, in my opinion.

Afghanistan's initial invasion was special operations forces on the ground working with indigenous groups who overthrew the Taliban with a gradual increase in American forces. In Iraqi Freedom, the Coalition steamrolled the Iraqi military in a calculated campaign that did not stall like the Russians have. The US bungled the occupations of these countries, so not comparable.

Only an American can write that with a straight face, completely ignoring the irony of this statement as Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined had around 2.3 million direct civilian deaths. 2 million in Vietnam alone by the US own estimates. But I digress. 

 But overall the article is very interesting. The US did portray their invasions as being succesful to the national public, which causes some weird analysis of Russia's operations in Ukraine. 

'The US took over Iraq in 30 days, Russia can't even get to Kiev'. Which obviously forgets the inconvenient truth that the US never managed to control Iraq, not even after 15 years, let alone in 30 days. Plus, the core of the article is very relevant. Wars must have a clear, well-established and agreed upon objective. 

And it begs the question: what is Moscow's objective in Ukraine? Was it ever to conquer it and annex it completely? This would be folly. Ukraine has around 45 million citizes, Russia around 140 million. Annexing a country that big would be chaos in and by itself even if all Ukranians were willing. Integrating pension systems, social services, public debt, currencies, it would basically mean the founding of a new Russia from a political point of view. It would completely change the demographics of the country and create a 200 million plus behemoth. 

If we go with the official objectives, these are much more manageable. To recognize the Donbas regions as an independent country, consolidate Russia's claim to Crimea, and destroy Ukraine's army. After today's peace talks, this seems to be going according to plan. 

If we check the Russian media outlets, such as RT, it is portraying the war as a civil war, one with poor, non-professional militas fighting for independence in Donbas while the mighty Ukrainian army, with heavy NATO-supplied weapons, continues to kill and oppress the poor Russia minorities. 

I don't think that Putin's objective resembles the nation building experiences of the post-WW2 United States. There is no talk of democracy, for example, or of building strong Ukrainian institutions, or anything in that regard. Russia never claimed in public to want to control Kiev. All the reports, official or not, were discussing the region of Donbas and its independence, the neutrality of Ukraine, and the destruction of its military capability. 

If we disregard the whole 'denazification' talk, that seems empty, vague, and aimed at a local audience, then we have a list of very real, very specific and attainable objectives. So is Putin really playing by the American book or is Mr. Rose using his own views and doctrines to make sense of the Ukrainian war? 

The answer will come in the next months. The Kremlin might end this conflict in a short time after achieving its initial objectives of liberating the Donbas (which will exist as an independent country), destroying the Ukrainian army (which seems to be in bad shape), and ensuring that Ukraine will not join NATO (which was agreed to today). 

So while Mr. Rose is certainly right about the failures of the US Army, I'm not so convinced he is about the course of this specific conflict. If in fifteen years we still have Russian troops trying to nation-build Ukraine, then sure, it was a war without a clear objective. But so far this seems like an unlikely scenario.",1429d013d8f8b171f2f56ae5b912d9db6a47ea0a,True,False,,,,,0,1648565077,,0,{},i2kixxn,False,t3_tr0o4d,False,True,t1_i2keoby,/r/geopolitics/comments/tr0o4d/the_irony_of_ukraine_we_have_met_the_enemy_and_it/i2kixxn/,1648565092,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648536277.0,,

""The description of Putin’s mistakes is a decent summary of not just the earlier Soviet experience in Afghanistan but also much of U.S. national security policy over the last several decades, including the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Washington has repeatedly launched military interventions with extravagantly unrealistic expectations, overestimated its own capabilities and underestimated its opponents, believed it would be loved rather than hated, and thought it could put its favorites into office and then get away easily. And time and again, after running up against the same harsh realities as Putin, it has tried to bull its way forward before ultimately deciding to reverse course and withdraw.  
Yes, American motives were nobler. Yes, American methods were less brutal (most of the time). Yes, there were many other differences between the conflicts. But on a strategic level, the broad similarities are striking.""

We've never used the sanctions with Cuba to negotiate even incremental human rights guarantees.  It's either all or nothing with these debates.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On the other hand, an actual economic and societal relationship might have actually given leverage over the other side. It might have also changed the picure of the US and democracy in the population and the ruling class.

China suggests that this isn't the case.  The West spent decades providing China with incentives to reform and they haven't.  In fact, in some ways, they've become more predatory and less willing to engage on human rights than they were in the 1990s.  And because of the integration of China into the global economy we have less ability to sanction China over things like the Uighur genocide.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There are actual people on the other side.

Normal Cubans saw very little, if any, economic benefits from increased trade with the US after the Cuba normalization.  For instance, the Cuban government keeps the dollars that US tourists spent on the island and only pays resort workers in pesos (which are worthless.)  If tourists want to book an Airbnb, the Cuban military takes a significant cut off the top and the proprietor is only paid in pesos, not dollars.  It goes on and on.  The only thing US tourism did on Cuba is increase the Cuban dictatorship and military's access to hard currency.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The US is a welcome external enemy for regimes in North Korea or Iran, for example.

Iranian sanctions did have the intended effect.  Why else was Iran willing to negotiate a temporary freeze in its nuclear program?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sanctions can only work if you can take something away, like in the case of Russia now.

Sanctions in Russia have different aims than sanctions in Cuba.  They are meant to degrade Russia's ability to resupply its war machine and to punish the Russian oligarchs and larger populace for their support of the unjust war in Ukraine.  I don't think that they are the main leverage against the Russian invasion - that would be the Ukrainian army's shockingly effective combination of asymmetric and conventional warfare.  The sanctions are to support Ukraine's war efforts.  This is different from Cuba where sanctions are the main negotiating leverage that the US has to improve human rights on the island.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over time, their effect gets blunted and even reversed.

Of course they remain potent.  Otherwise, Cuba wouldn't constantly complain about them.",701fcc48256d25917253d30f4c5f445790f2671c,True,False,,,,,0,1648562791,,0,{},i2kdf1w,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_i2jkusn,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i2kdf1w/,1648562803,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648533991.0,,

&gt;...increasing levels of credit risk have created pressure for stronger repayment safeguards. Chief among these safeguards is collateralization, which has become the linchpin of China’s implementation of a high-risk, high-reward credit allocation strategy. In the interest of securing energy and natural resources that it lacks in sufficient quantities at home and maximizing investment returns on surplus dollars and euros, China has rapidly scaled up the provision of foreign currency-denominated loans to resource-rich countries that suffer from high levels of corruption. These loans are collateralized against future commodity export receipts to minimize repayment and fiduciary risk and priced at relatively high interest rates (nearly 6%).

And that is a debt trap.

RCEP is an ASEAN creation to which China signed on as a plus one member. ""...led the creation and expansion..."" is something that you literally made up out of thin air.

ASEAN is going to be the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030 with 60 percent of its population, which in less than ten years will be larger than Europe by one or two hundred million people, under the age of 35. Those people are going to be linked economically on an unprecedented scale not just via RCEP and CPTPP but through the rapid industrialization and modernization of infrastructure and supporting sectors of their economies, education, a growing middle class and a better relationship with global powers than China has. 

Those people have been taken advantage of wholesale by the Chinese for years and they are going to bring themselves a world where they no longer have to be. And they are going to eat China's lunch. Later (or sooner) they will look back and recognize what Chinese were doing in their countries all these years and they will be looking for justice and rectification.

The difference, this time they would sign it after having levelled thier country. This is what will poison Ukraine- any leader that signs an agreement with Russia will be hated.

This is why Zelenskyy is trapped. He cannot negotiate now because he would have razed his country only to negotiate in the end. He also cannot hope for a military victory, because Ukraine cannot invade Russia to remove Putin. 

This is is why Zelenskyy is asking for harder sanctions and more weapons. He is hoping that a military fiasco in Ukraine will remove Putin due to disgrace. 

The issue is that Putin will level Kiev and every metro in Ukraine before he goes down. His military will obey the order because the leaders that backed the assault on Ukraine will face serious consequences- Ukrainian FM Koleba has been talking about The Hague. Utterly counterproductive since it just makes the Russians more paranoid and ruthless. 

Zelenskyy is ready to watch Kiev go down like Mariupol has because he knows that NATO nations will rebuild Ukraine for helping them get rid of Putin. The construction boom alone from the rebuilding will be a massive wealth generator for the Ukrainian elite. 

As an aside, Turkey is also primed to cash in by exporting it's bloated construction sector capacity to Ukraine, cashing out the goodwill from the TB2 drone purchases. 

Ukraine's capacity to resist should not be a surprise- they have received US military guidance for almost a decade and have had an active war front in Donbass where they could bloody their troops the whole time.

Zelenskyy will negotiate and will sign a neutrality agreement. The pain of the war only to sign a neutrality agreement will make this a bitter pill to swallow, but the size of the reconstruction package that Ukraine extracts will make the medicine go down easier. 

Putin will spin this as a win. Claim he never wanted to turn Ukraine to Belarus, and the sanctions will be lifted in time for winter to avoid having the gas turned off next year.
