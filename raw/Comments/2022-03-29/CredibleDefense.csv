1) The enemy is regrouping to refocus in JFO area iot attempt encirclement\neutralization of the forces in the area.

Lugansk group will attempt push through Izyum (south of the town and Kremenetz hills are still under firm ZSU control) and through Oskil in the direction of Barvinkove to Stepanivka, with a possible fixing action at Lyman and Svyatohirsk. Donetsk group will attempt pushing from Donetsk and Volnovakha through Maryinka and Vuhledar in the direction of Pokrovsk. The final goal is to meet around Dobropillya. Northern pincer will be the strongest due to various operational and logistical factors preventing reinforcement of the south pincer. Also due to the fact that the army group South is so overextended. They have a directive to fully neutralize Mariupol by the end of this week (which they won't achieve), and they would try their best to somehow hold bridge at Dnipro right bank. And still they have orders to somehow push to the north. Well we'll see how it goes. It is gonna be fun for sure.

2) Another important part of this operation is a meat ram of 1,2 Army Corps (the so-called L/DPR). Of all casualties you see circulating in the media, **none of them include L/DPR troops**. And I don't think anybody could count them anyway. You can't imagine what's going on at line of contact in JFO right now.

Logically and rationally, Russia shouldn't attack.it didn't mass enough force to conquer or occupy Ukraine, but it did. 

Rationally, spending 50 billions a year into Afghanistan, a country whose annual GDP after 15 years of 50 billions a year expenditure on, around 2 billions a year direct funding of the ANA, and god knows what else, is 19 billions, is a stupid idea and totally illogical. Even worse, given the levels of the already spent blood and treasure, Afghanistan shoud not be given up so easily. Yet it was.

There are parts of wars that are illogical, especially among empires and imperialists.

&gt;The Ukrainians are not proxies. This is the Russian Ukranian war, where Ukraine is supported by allied. This is very much not a proxy conflict.

https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/a-proxy-war-in-ukraine-is-the-worst-possible-outcome-except-for-all-the-others/

&gt;U.S. policymakers have so far wisely refused to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine or impose a no-fly zone to ground Russian warplanes. But alongside weapons intended to kill Russian soldiers and destroy Russian planes, they are reportedly providing reconnaissance data to Ukrainian forces. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, meanwhile, has declared that she “absolutely supports” British citizens who want to volunteer to fight in defense of Ukraine. Last week, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress by video, he was greeted by calls of “Slava Ukraini!” — “Glory to Ukraine!”

&gt;This is what a proxy war looks like. 

This is what a proxy war looks like and it's the best outcome. It is a proxy war. At least said so by:

But the only example we have to go by - though dated - is that of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the blockade that the US had set up around Cuba. There too Soviet naval assets had come into close proximity to US naval assets but there was no firefights. One reason for this - as Graham Allison has pointed out - was because US and Soviet leaders recognised the volatility of the situation especially given the nuclear angle. Thus, each party backed off. Interestingly, President Kennedy also removed US nuclear-armed missiles from Turkey as part of the quid pro quo with Krushchev. It is important to note that in this example, the USSR was the out-of-area power and thus would have been hard pressed to defend its interests.

In the Taiwanese situation, should a blockade be instituted, the US would be the out-of-area power. Secondly, both forces (US and Chinese) would be acutely aware of their own nuclear capabilities and the potentially hair-trigger situation that would develop as the fleets of both navies came into close proximity to each other. Lastly, one should also not underestimate the reticence that the US may have - and conversely the belligerence that the Chinese may display - to engage with the PRC at such close quarters to the Chinese mainland over the issue of Taiwan ([which the US, it should be noted, has not guaranteed to support given its recognition of the One-China policy that it has maintained thus far](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-us-one-china-policy-and-why-does-it-matter)).

The answer for every European colonial power to the post-WW2 decolonization era was to invest more in the EU project, in the tentative hope it would give them back some of the international clout (and national prestige) they lost - except for the UK, which turned to the US. Russia has no comparable option, it doesn't have any real friends.

Also, the degree to which a country can ""move on"" from it's days of peak prestige depends strongly on the amount of exceptionalism that is backed in it's national identity. In Europe, the two countries which anchor their national myth in the idea that they are a great power, a state that is in some way exceptional and remarkable, a nation that is supposed to be near the top of the pecking order - is France and Russia (and no, the UK very clearly doesn't count).     
Unsurprisingly, it's also the two countries that favor the worldview of Great Power Politics and cynicism the most, that have a strong national emphasis on autarky and lean almost obsessively into a sense of independence from the current ""top dog"" (i.e. America). Because if your national identity puts stake in being a great power, odds are you want to see and appreciate the results of that fact every now and then. And seeing evidence to the contrary hurts. So giving up on the notion that you are a citizen of a great power in the world implies a partial loss of national identity, and that's not easy on an emotional level. (Though, of course, France is nowhere near as deluded as Russia is wrt it's own real power, it's just the *closest* example.)

&gt; Imagine a very pro-China Canada/Mexico. Remember the Cuban missile Crisis. Heck, you have the very same situation happening right now in Ukraine.

It's a very different problem. What constitutes a Ukraine-Russian stand-off is security based. But the cross-strait relations are not just security, but what is China. 

To put it this way, Seoul is very close to Beijing. Closer than Havana is to Washington DC. China isn't going to invade SK anytime soon. Because structurally it doesn't even matter if the US conquers SK, that itself does not change what constitutes as China. During the Korean War, the vast majority of the Chinese leadership disagreed with Mao, the vast majority of them didn't think there are political need to support NK even as the UN forces barrels down towards China. Most of them just want to fortify Manchuria and station troops across the Yalu. 

Of course, ideally, great powers, particularly land powers, wants buffer and regions of influence, and super power who can project globally would prefer to be able to continue to project globally, so sure China would like the US to fuck off from Asia, and the US would prefer to be able to fuck with China in Chinese backyard rather than in American backyard. However, the crisis for the cross-strait issue is far deeper and far more profound. The amt of Chinese willing to go to war for NK against the Americans would be pretty much 0. No one wants to fight America in NK even if it's done before and China is much stronger today. But if that issue is Taiwan? The situtation changes.

“Before Russia attacked, Turkish officials believed the drones could be effective against the Russian military.

This article talks about how badly the Russians failed to destroy Ukrainian manned and unmanned air power, failed to secure air superiority and win the electronic warfare sphere or utilize their own layer IAD allowing the TB2 to have almost unfettered access to Russian Supply convoys:

Land-weapons and equipment are a weird problem anyway, because in order to get Ukraine equipment they can *use right as they get it* they need to go into the depths of the old Soviet arsenals. How much of this can they give up?

But to give them better equipment, we need to train them on it.

Drones and loitering munitions are admittedly an exception. The US has promised to send 1000 switchblades which is good news, and the TB-2s were apparently easy to get and immediately put to use.

This war is already a month old. Had the west started training Ukraine on their artillery day 1, they could have send units in a month or 6 weeks. Doesn't sound so long now. Ukraine has more artillery reservists than pieces. 

Is your argument against sending weapons to Ukraine is that some of them will be destroyed? I mean... That's war, what do you expect. Is the goal to prevent the destruction of NATO provided weapons? The solution is simple, don't send any weapons and allow a Russian victory.

I don't see any indication that they are capable of making any kind of breakthrough to encircle large portions of the JFO, and I don't think grinding progress in the Donbas is any kind of win.

That said if they want to they can hold onto at least some territory, at least in the east. It looks like the North is not capable of holding out and that is why they are withdrawing. The southern front West of the Dneiper has been largely on the defensive for a week. So really it all depends on negotiations.

I would call this a loss for a war of conquest. Russia didn't feed a decent chunk of its offensive forces into a woodchipper to eat away at the borders of a country that has like a fourth of its population and maybe a fifth of its GDP and a twelth of it's military budget.

The west clearly thought it was much more capable that it ended up being. They thought it was made from titanium when in reality it was made from steel making it extremely heavy (basically the weight of two fully loaded F-4 Phantoms.

They thought the plane was extremely agile and maneuverable based on its large wings. In reality the plane was not maneuverable at all. The large wings were in fact needed due to something called “inertial coupling’ which is a kind of high speed instability.

It’s engines were taken of a cruise missile and were never designed for continuous use making them quite unreliable. The engines were fast but only for a short period of time. The US knew that MIG25 could reach mach3.5 but they didn’t know that doing that ended up killing the engines.

It also had a very powerful but limited radar that lacked any “look down” capability making it basically totally useless for anything other than high altitude interceptions.

Long story short the Mig25 was build for speed and sacrificed everything to get it. In that aspect the plane was in fact definitely not trash and did exactly what it was supposed to do. 

But….the west thought it was an air superiority fighter akin to their future F15 (which was actually developed in response to MIG25)

The Mig had one job and that was to intercept american supersonic high altitude bombers….which the US never ended up producing. That left the MIG without a real job. The only real use for it now was trying to chase down a few SR71’s roaming the Soviet borders (The MIGs proved to be to slow as they were only mach-3.5 capable for a very short amount of time)

Unless the current corruption is not present in the Russian government, its growth and progression as a country is stunted in everything it does. This can be seen in Russian demographics, which was already bad before the invasion, and will get worse. In this sense, even if on paper reforms and efforts are taken, because the practice of corruption is so deep, it can't really get anywhere. At least, not without painting over the cracks.

So, while Russia, in theory, can fix itself...its reliant on dumping the corrupt parasites that rule it in order to fix itself.

I am not an expert at all, but:

I think you're kind of backing into the real answer here. There's other tools that do the job better. The main advantages of artillery are: Portability, Rate of Fire, and cost. 

As you move to ever more powerful guns, your rate of fire and portability go out the window, and the logistics part of the system increases. 

So you move up to things like rockets, drones with pgms, etc... 

All of which is to say, I am sure it would be TECHNICALLY possible to increase ranges (though I assume pretty high diminishing returns where ever higher proportions of the initial kinetic energy is lost to atmospheric drag), there's just not a great case for why bother.

I'd be curious to see how that math works.  China seems to have figured out a ""post colonialism"" strategy of just buying natural resources rather than trying to conquer territory, and it seems to work well for the 21st Century.

By the time you figure the costs of conquest, costs of rebuilding, costs of occupation, costs of resistance, costs of international sanctions, etc., it's not obvious that it ever pays off, even in a simple ""video game"" style economics that considers zero cost of human suffering.  And whatever natural resources are being claimed in Ukraine's territory may or may not be particularly valuable in 50+ years when they supposedly start paying off.  On that time scale, stuff like asteroid mining literally might not be science fiction any more.  And people may be using fusion and solar powered LED's to grow food in cheap underground tunnels dug by robots and vertical farms in repurposed skyscrapers.

This is again.. not true. The post-soviet system of economics in Russia was a *mess.* Russia basically inherited the bureaucratic inefficiency of the Soviet Union with none of the state programs that made it work.

Why is the land bridge between the breakaway republics the most important immediate goal? Russia already has land, sea and air access to Crimea, how is the coast of the sea of Azov a worthy strategic goal?

If the operations around Kiev were designed to be fixing operations, then they don't deserve the comparison to naval operations off the coast of Kuwait. Surely there would have been an opportunity to fix Ukrainian troops in place in Kiev without the number of casualties and urban fighting that occurred during Russias moves on the city? Why attack suburbs and the airport immediately and not wait until some forces appear to be leaving the town, only to then feint an attack to draw them back in? If this was such a ruse, it was incredibly poorly executed.

If the destruction of the Donbas troops was the final plan, why has Russia made so little progress in encircling them as opposed to cutting them of from the sea? Ukraine doesn't have a navy, but it has the advantage of territorial knowledge in the center of its country, where Russian supply lines would be longest. Why cut of sea access and not land access?

https://imgur.com/ln9oL1P

There's clearly a powerful light source somewhere in front of him, which is why he is illuminated as he is.  Every light source in your vicinity projects some kind of shadow, and whatever its identity, there clearly there is **some** kind of light source projecting the one I'm talking about, and the geometry of it on the street is pretty unambiguously not what would happen on a green screen.

&gt; This video with a completely static background

Which parts of the background would move if it were ""real""?  The pavement?  The fixed lamps?  The walls?  The background is behaving as you'd expect that background to behave.

&gt;It begins with him emerging from the ground.

https://imgur.com/Ts9iHqo

He takes 3 steps forward and his head rises a consistent amount, while his belt and legs lowers, as is pretty consistent with perspective.  Not really ""rising"" out of anything, just moving 3 steps closer to a camera.

&gt;It has no background noise in a literal urban warzone.

You can find videos of the Kyiv center live - excepting explosions when a rocket or bomb hits, it's pretty quiet, and that's during the day, at night there's curfews which make it a complete ghost town.  Also, pretty robust noise cancellation comes with most modern hardware and software, and any background noises would be hard to hear over the loud Ukrainian man talking, so to even start determining whether there are any you'd have to split the channels.

&gt;It is also extremely cold in Kiev at the time of filming this video. Shouldn't he be wearing a coat? It's below freezing, why isn't there visible vapor when he speaks

While it's obviously unclear when it was precisely filmed, the nights around the 19th range from 40 to 23 f (no serious windchill), which is cold, but a pretty large range - personally his long sleeve vest and pants are something I'd be comfortable wearing for a 15 minute outing if it's anywhere above 30 without windchill.  Then again, I'm from a country with really cold winters, which makes me very different from Zelensky /s. 

Visible breath?  I don't see any, but depending on the precise time of filming, it may not be cold enough for me to see much condensed breath from where the camera is.  I don't have a degree in condensing breath, but in my experience for borderline temperatures I have to consciously heavily exhale to see my own breath - just talking and passively breathing seems to require lower temperatures to be constantly visible.

&gt;Where is his security team?

He's walked around Kyiv several times without visible security guards, so this is a non argument, especially when they can easily be out of view, like the cameraman.

&gt;What are these ""other reasons"" this was not greenscreen?

I've covered them above - the reasons are your arguments.  Even beyond green screen enthusiasts being unable to explain away the shadow, all ""evidence"" you've so ardently provided is circumstantial at best and I've discussed how they're not remotely conclusive. 

Like, ""where's his security team""? You've spent enough time on this to make videos on it and those are the types of arguments you still field?  Not only is it clearly not green screen due to that opening, but you've also failed to conclusively demonstrate anything else that would make it ""obviously green screen"".

Like, and this is before we even consider the fact that there's plenty of evidence he's in Kyiv - you can't even prove this one thing you're so focused on is green screen.  Not great.

If you still in good faith believe you can prove his videos aren't from Kyiv or are all prerecorded, I recommend just looking at mains hum or metadata or many other factors  that would conclusively demonstrate any of the Kiev videos/photos he posts daily aren't from Kiev - you're spoiled for choice so if he's genuinely conducting his entire operation from Poland or whatever, this would be trivial.  It would probably take less effort than your 20 minute video, so you can't claim you don't have the time.  And you're not the only one who could do this - a lot of people are insisting that Zelensky isn't in Kyiv, and not a single one took these steps that would **irrefutably** demonstrate he isn't.  Sussy.

That's before we consider he's not isolated - he meets dozens of people every day.  He met the polish, czech, and slovenian pms for chrissakes!  There would be thousands of people at this point who would have to be actively lying about being in Kyiv while actually being in a different city, including reporters and politicians who constantly tweet and make videos **in Kyiv**.

I'm not sure if I agree with this. Russia would have overwhelming numbers, yes - but I don't know how much pure numbers are worth on the modern conventional battlefield. If Russia sent, say, 500,000 hastily trained troops outfitted as light infantry to Ukraine, would they be able to achieve anything, or would they just be more targets?

I suspect that the relative lethality of modern weapons systems and relative lack of ways to mitigate their lethality means that the optimum density of forces is rather low. So in a conflict where the ""action"" is concentrated on a line of contact between two conventional forces, the optimum total number of forces involved is rather low. Adding more troops to the front line has sub-linear returns, but incurs super-linear increases in logistics requirements. (Super-linear because, in general, if Y supplies are currently delivered using X resources, the resources needed to deliver 2 * Y supplies are more than double X.)

Before anyone jumps on me about Afghanistan, I think the same principle applies, but the nature of battle is different. In an occupation and counter-insurgency operation, the ""action"" isn't concentrated on a line of contact but rather spread across a large area, meaning that at the same density the optimal number of troops is far larger.",08dd21e661b712084f67b898a0d0e9de9f85a60c,True,False,,,,,0,1648574078,,0,{},i2l6aa8,False,t3_tqxgsl,False,True,t1_i2kuvl4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqxgsl/ukraine_megathread_march_29/i2l6aa8/,1648574099,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648545278.0,,

&gt; Much attention has been paid to China’s efforts to modernize its military with new naval vessels, aircraft, nuclear weapons, and other equipment. China has made significant progress on these fronts, but weaponry and equipment are only part of the equation. To successfully project power, countries also need adequate infrastructure and logistics capabilities for deploying troops and equipment. China is currently undertaking a major expansion of its infrastructure that is enhancing its ability to project military power along its western frontier.

&gt; Within its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, China is constructing and upgrading dozens of airports and heliports—a large majority of which are military or dual-use facilities.1 China is supplementing its airpower expansion with new roads, rail, and other infrastructure that are upgrading the PLA’s logistics capabilities and enabling more rapid movement of troops, weaponry, and equipment. The pace of development in the region accelerated following standoffs and skirmishes between China and India along disputed portions of their border in 2017 and 2020. China also has growing security and economic interests in neighboring countries in South and Central Asia, as well as concerns about the potential for unrest within its own borders.

Mission Statement
China’s transformation from a developing economy into an emerging global power is likely to be the most consequential factor in twenty-first-century international politics. Its economy is now the second largest in the world, millions of Chinese citizens have been lifted out of poverty, and the People’s Liberation Army is quickly modernizing. In just a few decades, China has moved from the periphery to the center of the international system.

Yet despite numerous advances, China’s rise is not complete and its capabilities remain uneven. By some standards China is a developed country, yet in other ways it is still developing. Moreover, the nature of Chinese power is poorly understood. These unknowns result in misrepresentations of China’s position within the international community, which contributes to the uncertainty over the implications of China’s rise. ChinaPower addresses this problem by providing our users with the necessary tools to compare Chinese power with that of other countries.

Power as a concept is nebulous. Therefore, ChinaPower offers a clear statement of how we conceptualize power throughout the website. In broad terms, ChinaPower examines five interrelated categories of Chinese power: military, economic, technological, social, and international image. Since Chinese power cannot be evaluated in a vacuum, each element of power is compared with other relevant countries.

At the heart of ChinaPower are exploratory questions specifically developed to illuminate the different aspects of Chinese power. The questions include, among others, How is China modernizing its nuclear forces? How influential is China in the World Trade Organization? How web-connected is China? Engaging with such questions, users will have the necessary tools to explore the evolution of Chinese power and the implications of China’s rise.

In this way, ChinaPower uses data visualization and expert analysis to unpack the complexity of Chinese power. The data that drives our visualizations has been carefully selected to enhance our users’ understanding of Chinese power. To ensure the reliability of our data, each indicator has been reviewed by our expert steering committee. All data utilized by ChinaPower that is not otherwise copyrighted or protected is freely downloadable through our data repository.

Data itself only tells half the story. Our experts provide the necessary context to help users interpret the data and to address complex questions for which data is not readily available. The inclusion of expert analysis is a unique feature of ChinaPower. The experts who contribute analysis to ChinaPower conduct their analysis in their personal capacity, using the expertise they have acquired as scholars and officials. All contributors have intellectual independence and have been invited to share their personal perspectives.

CSIS and ChinaPower strive to maintain objectivity. ChinaPower does not promote a particular point of view, nor does it advocate a specific conclusion regarding the trajectory or consequences of China’s rise. Through interacting with the questions developed on this site, ChinaPower empowers our users to draw their own conclusions. The ChinaPower team welcomes feedback and opinions, and hopes to lay the groundwork for constructive debate on China’s rise. 

ChinaPower is made possible by a generous contribution from Carnegie Corporation of New York.

No. An invasion requires a massive amount shifting of resources, additional training, logistics hubs. Aircraft would moved to different airfields. Rocket forces would move from their usual spots. Drills would be run. Even those few brigades would mean shifting massive amounts of resources from other theaters to ports near Taiwan. There's zero way that they could surprise Taiwan and the US and everyone notable person who's ever written any on the subject had said as much. The best they could do is pretend it's a ""military excerise"" but even that'd be pretty obvious bullshit. There's also signal intercepts, human intelligence, internal propaganda, and many many thing.

&gt;No country does rely on those things alone. That doesn’t mean they’re certain or even likely to fail.

My point is your plan can't rely on them working. Russia, based on the current repots, actually DID rely on this working. Putin thought he'd bought off of Ukarine government officials, that they army would fall with the invasion just like the Afghan army fell. That's why this current invasion is such a shit show.

&gt;First time I've heard the Israeli Defense Forces aren't good fighting material.

Israeli Defense Force conscripts, like all conscripts, are mostly shit at fighting. Their career fighters are what they're known for. Do you think there conscript forces are the ones doing the heavy fighting? Most of these conscripts are glorified military police at best, and paper pushers at worse. By the way the IDF hasn't done anything impressive in decades. 2006 was an embarrassment for them. Even in 67 and 73 it was their Air Force and intelligence services that won them the day.

&gt;Considering the horizon is barely 3 miles away, no. And even if that were true, at that distance it would still take longer for ground forces to drive to a new location en masse and reposition than for the invasion fleet to arrive there.

What are you talking about the horizon is 140km away if you're on a mile high mountain. Even if you're only 50m above sea level it's 20km+ away. Learn some basic math son, here a calculator 

https://www.everythingrf.com/rf-calculators/line-of-sight-calculator

&gt;Yet the US and Russia both did them in the past 2 decades.

America hasn't done an opposed amphibious invasion since Korea. Learn some basic history as well.

&gt;Have you turned your computer off for 2 weeks? Russia has almost total air supremacy right now and there are multiple reports of Russian bombings every day. Air kills have ground to a virtual halt.

Not according to US and UK intel. Both sides are run sorties every day and both sides are losing aircraft.

&gt;Seriously? This is the brilliant plan? It has never been done before. The Serbs in 1999 scored some opportunistic kills by hugging the mountain line then climbing rapidly, but they weren't able to get away through the mountains. That would involve plummeting from the air at at least hundreds of miles per hour during a high speed air to air chase, into jagged terrain, then hoping to get a terrain object between you and the enemy's LDSD radar.

They practice this regularly. 

&gt;You're aware there are amphibious armored vehicles, right?

[],False,,TheNthMan,,,[],,,,text,t2_f2tj4z6,False,False,"There are two reasons.

1) The EU mutual defense pact does not establish a unified military command.  The EU does not have the militaries co-ordinate or drill together.  The EU mutual defense pact does it dictate any specific response or aid for the one being attacked.  The EU mutual defense pact only specifies:

&gt;If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with article 51 of the United Nations charter

So a member of the EU can just offer something like 5000 helmets or whatever in response to a fellow EU member being attacked and if they figure out a way to spin whatever they provide as ""all ways"" they can help at that moment in time, they can claim that they have fulfilled their obligation.

2) The dominant Russian political thought is based on Dugin's version of Neo-Eurasianism, his ""fourth political theory"" (to differentiate his version of Fascism from Nazism, which was the ""third political theory"" as in Third Reich).  Dugin's version of Neo-Euroasianism holds that the Atlanticists are fomenting discord in the land powers of Europe.  Dugin holds that the Atlanticists. the Anglo-Saxon race, have manipulated the land-powers of Europe to fight amongst each other to weaken them and allow them to be dominated by the Anglo-Saxons.  Part of this domination is the export of ""Foreign"" ideals, such as liberalism, Western style democracy, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and secular humanism.  These  ""foreign"" exports from the Atlanticists and are corrupting and weakening the states to prepare them for domination / destruction.  The center of gravity for the Anglo-Saxon ""Atlanticists"" has shifted from the UK to the USA as the primary antagonist to Russia's empire building.

Atlanticists in Dugin's view colonize, conquer and destroy competing ideologies - Atlanticists are political absolutists.  Russia on the other hand in Dugin's view is believed to tend to assimilate cultures, and thus is inherently more diverse and multicultural.  Dugin believes that the Atlanticists are actively preventing Russia from becoming the natural hegemon for continental Eurasian the champion for the ""Eurasian tribe"" in what he describes as the ""Moscow Berlin axis"".  Dugin also has a two other axis, the Moscow-Tokyo and Moscow-Teheran axis to complete the Eurasian tribe

Dugin believes that Russia has an imperial manifest destiny, and that:

&gt;The repudiation of the empire-building function would signify the end of the Russian people as a … civilizational phenomenon. Such a repudiation would be tantamount to national suicide.

The Atlanticists are seeking to corrupt and debase continental Europe through injecting ""Western"" ideals.  Because Russia is resisting the corruption, and because Russia's manifest destiny is to create an empire, unifiying the Eurasian tribe, Atlanticist absolutism thus requires that Russia be destroyed and dismembered.
 
The EU without the ""foreign"" influences of the USA and Britain will eventually naturally assimilate into the Eurasian tribal bloc led by ethnic Russians.

&gt;[t]he task of Moscow is to tear Europe away from the control of the U.S. (NATO), to assist European unification, and to strengthen ties with Central Europe under the aegis of the fundamental external axis Moscow-Berlin.

So Sweden, Finland and Ukraine joining the EU is not as objectionable as to joining NATO, because that just delays the inevitable assimilation to the Eurasian tribe once Russia deals with NATO.",36ed5fdf8d5a6beea24dd370713fbdd97654d240,True,False,,,,,0,1648568422,,0,{},i2kremi,False,t3_tqxgsl,False,True,t1_i2kbh7h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqxgsl/ukraine_megathread_march_29/i2kremi/,1648568436,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648539622.0,,

Not to say that Putin is right even on his own terms, but he might be sort of saying something different than the west is hearing when he talks about ""Nazis""

The west understandably thinks of Nazi as meaning ""authoritarian, antisemitic, right-wing, genocidal.""  The Russians who fought the Nazis were also under the rule of a authoritarian anti-Semite, so those elements may not be as key to defining Naziism to them. The key part of Naziism from a Russian perspective is that it is an enemy to their west. I suspect it was ultimately the Nazi's ""kill most Slavs and enslave the few remaining"" policies that stuck in the non-Jewish Russian mind more than the ""kill all Jewish people"" policies. 

In addition to just the ""Nazi means western enemy"" The Putinst logic seems to be: the first Ukrainian nationalist movement occurred when Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and Ukrainians joined, ergo any form of Ukrainian nationalism is actually just a species of Naziism.

I don't think it's actually *true* that that's really the first Ukrainian nationalism, but it's a comparatively mild twist of historical fact. 

Of corridor, Putin is also the kind of troll authoritarian who just says shit that's blatantly untrue to your face to assert his power over truth.

I'm not sure ""hypernationalism"" has much meaning beyond ""nationalism"" when its divorced from claims or attempts to achieve global or even regional power status.  Every nation indulges in some level of nationalism but it seems difficult to find too much wrong with it when its not accompanied by military coercion and belligerence, ala Russia.

I'm not sure anyone thinks that Ukraine has ambitions on being some kind of regional power with goals of politically and militarily dominating its direct neighbors or nations outside of its region.  It's getting into fantastical fiction territory to imagine some weird future where Ukraine is a regional power dominating its neighbors without being allied/aligned with Russia.

Arguably the worst you can say about highly nationalistic countries without regional or global power ambitions is that they have burdensome immigration and visa rules and they don't treat foreigners well inside their borders.

[],False,,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,"&gt;Urban warfare is hell. Urban warfare for attacking side is double the hell. 

For the attackers, it's garden variety hell. You generally don't defend cities inside cities because you are strong. You do so, because you are weak and this is your last chance. Offical Red Army doctrines in prior to Stalingrad said that you defend cities by digging fortifications *around* the city, then evacuate through the city and away. That was what happened in Odessa (Great Patriotic War, not 2022). Stalingrad, Chuikov, and 62nd Army happened accidentally, with Chuikov's back against the Volga and higher commands expected that they may be destroyed. German VI Army suffered ferocious casualties but the Red 62nd Army suffered much worse. 

It's much worse for defenders: they are cut off from supplies. Being surrounded and cut off *is* bad and generally speaking, without a relieving army on the way, it's usually various degrees of slow defeats. 

It is the *worst* for civilians. Cities don't produce its own food and constant work is needed to provide electricity, clean water, and removal.of waste. Without those, people shit themselves to death all the times. How do you cook food? Where's the fuel? Where's clean water to drink and wash hands, etc ... Survival skills like making fires and finding clean waters work in the wilderness or forests, not in cities. 

I can tell you from personal experience that we can keep a lot of babies alive with milk formula.and bottle feed. However, all of those need clean water to make the milk, wash the bottles, and energy to sterilise them. Without those, babies die. Plain and simple. The hell on the attackers or defenders are nothing compared to civilians. Urban battles are sieges and historically for the longest time, defending armies asked civilians to leave. Sieges boiled down most of the time, to a contest of food storage and supply with both sides waiting the other to starve out. The defenders stack things in their favours by having as few people inside as possible.",e5088f5bd58d784dcb9d3ea7b0bc3f29f29ca765,True,False,,,,,0,1648559121,,0,{},i2k59l4,False,t3_tqxgsl,False,True,t1_i2k066b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqxgsl/ukraine_megathread_march_29/i2k59l4/,1648559133,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648530321.0,,

They didn't necessarily need to know the whole extent, but certainly enough to know it would perform poorer than it should.

I agree that in principle they could've evaluated the capacity of their armed forces (the idea that they couldn't do that simply because they hadn't fought a war is ludicrous). However, consider that even in the US armed forces, information about the utter failure to train the Afghan National Army was suppressed, whistleblowers silenced and this ultimately led to the most humiliating moment for the US armed forces in decades.

The reason this is still debatable is that we hardly have a null sample anywhere in the world; practically every first-world society implemented quarantine measures that had great effect.

You made a great argument on why those islands are not Japan via San Francisco Treaty-Potsdam Declaration-Yalta Agreement trifecta even if they are inherent national territories of Japan, but the argument is much weaker for Russian sovereignty today(as opposed to independence/self rule of some form/right to self determination).

[],False,,honor-,,,[],,,,text,t2_ud5us,False,False,"&gt;Over the years I have found that people who do not take on board what is being said are not worth arguing with.

I'm sorry you feel like I am arguing in bad faith. So let's do a detailed breakdown of the tweet.

The author's evidence for their claims rests on a single excerpt from a paper by Andrey Belousov.

&gt;Consider this paper by now Deputy PM Belousov. The growth of middle class is problematic:  
\- they buy expensive imported goods  
\- they increase cost of labor, demand more labor rights  
\- they try to emigrate

Let's translate the excerpt (via google translate):

&gt;Main risks for Russia:  
\- switching demand for high-quality imported goods, reducing the role of low prices as a factor  
competitiveness and narrowing of market niches occupied by Russian goods;  
\- increased emigration activity of the middle class, stimulated by the expected shortage  
skilled workforce in EU countries due to population aging;  
\- segmentation of social infrastructure (health, education, social  
provision): the allocation of a developing core focused on the standards of the middle class, and  
the degrading periphery serving low-income social strata;  
\- increased social conflict and the growth of claims to increase wages, exceeding  
opportunities for companies to increase productivity;

Based off of Kamil's hypothesis, this evidence is supposed to mean that Russian elite will accept lower standards of living. I would disagree. This excerpt seems to be discussing economic headwinds affecting Russia.

&gt;The growth of middle class is problematic:

The excerpt makes no explicit claim of this. It only discusses Russian economic challenges. (perhaps this is Kamil's interpretation)

&gt;they buy expensive goods

This is discussed, but in the context that Russian businesses do not produce enough high quality goods, and the low quality goods that are produced are not desired. 

&gt;they increase cost of labor, demand more labor rights

This is discussed as a problem that reduces the ability of companies to improve productivity by keeping wages stagnant.

&gt;they try to emigrate

Sure, this is discussed as a headwind.

OK, so based off this evidence it appears that the reading of the excerpt seems to be flawed. There are multiple economic headwinds that are discussed in the context of Russia, and 2 of them are in relation to the middle class. But there doesn't seem to be any evidence here that Russian policy makers are considering lowering the standards of living amongst the middle class.

&gt;Again presenting the views of Russian elites and then being attacked   
because those views are not western liberal capitalism is, in my   
opinion, a very bad reading of this work.

Again, my point is that I am not attacking you. I am questioning the analysis of Kamil. I believe he got this wrong based on the evidence that was provided. I don't think that this is evidence that Russian policy-makers are considering lowering standards of living as a good thing. Again, I just don't think the evidence warrants a conclusion.

My initial take was not based on such a thorough analysis. It was based off a ""sniff"" test. I did not believe that a rational policy-maker would think that lowering standards of living was a good thing because GDP translates to taxes translates to defense spending. Russia wants defense spending and has been really strapped for funds. So the belief that a Russian elite would believe lower standards of living (i.e. GDP) is a good thing does not seem like a serious take.",b02b6823ce026e6b5f7cc9495cc93f65213429c4,True,False,,,,,0,1648542229,,0,{},i2jhczn,False,t3_tqaarh,False,True,t1_i2jbnth,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqaarh/ukraine_megathread_march_28/i2jhczn/,1648542243,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648513429.0,,

[],False,,BigBlueButtonMan2,,,[],,,,text,t2_fvf8jh6z,False,False,"I think that one snippet doesn't really convey the full thread, but I'll make some responses:

1. ""De-Escalating will strengthen Putin's rule because he took a gamble and won."" To a certain extent this would be true. If sanctions stopped today, and aid to Ukraine stopped (for some reason?) then this would Putin in a stronger position, certainly for a long term conflict. Ukraine would still be a problem because even if the plug was pulled on giving Russia a hard time, it is ultimately still Ukraine's pulling the ultimate legwork in this war. The big problem with this scenario is...it won't happen. The choice to not bother about Ukraine was a month ago, and Europe+the US chose to bother. His statement that if this happens Russia will be ""more like North Korea"" is somewhat incorrect. North Korea is infamous for its trash economy, totalitarianism generally, its cult, and total isolation. It's a very particular combination. While it would strengthen Putin's position, it would not become a carbon-copy of North Korea if the West de-escalated. Kind of the opposite, in a sense. Again, I can't see this happening because...why would the West do that...? So the only de-escalation that could happen is where a peace deal ends the conflict.
2. ""They couldn't know how bad the situation is in the Russian Army."" I disagree. A most cursory understanding, even if not explicitly stated and discussed, of the corruption chain should have made such people understand that the Russian Army is not in a state ready to fight a conventional army that does not have its same corruption problems. So either they knew and didn't care, or knew and for political reasons just went along with this charade anyway...apparently, under the impression that even this corrupt army would face no resistance. They didn't necessarily need to know the whole extent, but certainly enough to know it would perform poorer than it should.
3. ""It was Russian mass delusion."" Apparently, Russian state media really loved war-gaming how Russia could just own all of NATO on its own (barring the whole ""nuclear weapons might go boom"" aspect of such a hypothetical). I suppose there's at least some truth to this; or at least, the idea that enough of the Russian military's ""strengths"" would outweigh its weaknesses.
4. ""The Russians are just fighting for money and not any high ideals."" I'm not sure what is motivating a lot of Russian soldiers right now. They went into this fight believing it was a training exercise, I don't know what their motives are, and maybe no one really does. All I can say though, is that it'd be strange if they thought they were gonna get condos out of all of this, based on my knowledge of the Russian military...well, the officers and above might believe that, but I doubt the grunts do. Or at least, I'm not sure why they'd think this was a good financial transaction that they were effectively forced into.

And that's about all I'm willing to address. I don't like Twitter threads, and it's a strain with an image attached to every Tweet.

It does miss several important points. Any likely invasion will include a large drone force. Also all ground infrastructure will be targeted by cruise missiles or artillery.  In order to counter this the defenders will need a large done and counter-drone force of their own. This force should be able to operate even months after the invasion. Which means it needs to be distributed and well hidden underground where it will be able to withstand bombardment. 

Corollary to that it also follows that all strategically important assets should be moved underground so they are not observable by drones.  This includes ammo and fuel stockpiles, vehicles, hospitals etc...  Hence my recommendation of forming a large underground shelter network.

Russia's position rests on the following: 

* The Yalta Agreement: *3. The Kurile Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union;*
* The Potsdam Declaration: *8. The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshū, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine*; and
* the San Francisco Treaty: *3 (c) Japan renounces all right, title and claim to the Kurile Islands.* 

The Japanese have made mounted four arguments to counter the Russian claims:

* The first is to claim that Yalta and Potsdam weren't binding treaties and thus can't be a basis for Russian sovereignty in of themselves. This is indeed true, but Yalta and Potsdam do show what was meant by the Kurils and it isn't favorable to Japan's position. 
* The second argument is that since the Soviet Union didn't sign the San Francisco Treaty it can't use it to claim sovereignty using the San Francisco Treaty. There's some truth to this and the Russians acknowledge that they can't solely rely on San Francisco. But, at the same time, neither can Japan since it explicitly renounced all rights to the Kurils... right?  
* But no says Japan! What actually happened is that the islands we claim are not Kuril islands and thus 3(c) never applied to them! The problem for Japan is that the  Japan accepted that the not-Kurils were, in fact, part of the Kuril Islands when the San Francisco Treaty was signed. Japan's geographical redefinition in fact dates to after occurred between the signing of the San Francisco and the negotiations around the 1956 Declaration. This was only possible because Soviet-American relations had collapsed and the Americans were willing to entertain Japan's claims. 

Whatever the case, skipping over the nonsensical basis for Japan's claims to the Kuril Islands is about as reasonable as talking about the South China Seas disputes and just accepting that the Nine Dash Lines are valid. It does a gross disservice to understanding the sides actual positions and is misleading at worst... and probably, frankly, outright deceptive.  

Whatever the case, it isn't like the two are going to fight over this. The Russians are still committed to the 1956 Declaration which would return two of the four islands to Japan once a peace treaty is signed. Japan is just holding out to get the other two islands it claims added to the pot. Neither side is interested in going to war over the damned things. It would be utterly ridiculous to even try. Frankly, the bigger concern is Japan trying to unilaterally repudiate elements of the San Francisco Treaty it doesn't like.

The mobility disadvantage is in many cases far more one of GETTING the tank to the area of operations and how much time and vulnerable logistics support is needed to facilitate that. You are missing the point by focusing on what a tank can traverse once it is in the right spot.

&gt; Yes, tanks are vulnerable to ATGMs, but APCs and IFVs are even less survivable, and helicopters are vulnerable to MANPADs. 

Tanks cost multiple times more what APCs/IFVs do. The point isn't that a lighter armored APC/IFV is more survivable, the point is that it is a questionable choice to go for the increased cost, increased logistical support and to tolerate not being able to quickly move tanks regionally.

I don't think MBTs will disappear in the blink of an eye nor really ever go away but I just don't see how LOS direct fire 120mm cannons on platforms designed to withstand LOS direct fire 120mm cannons are the best way to go in an environment with UAVs and sophisticated guided ATGMs with significant ranges.

&gt; As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, there have been growing concerns that tensions are rising between Russia and Japan over the Kuril Islands. Stretching across 1200 kilometres, or 750 miles, between Hokkaido and the Khamchatka Peninsula, the southern part of the archipelago has been a source of friction between Tokyo and Moscow since the end of the Second World War. So, could we see a conflict between Russia and Japan over the islands?

&gt; Since 1945, Japan has been at odds with the Soviet Union and then Russia over the Kuril Islands. Originally divided between them in 1855 under the Treaty of Shimoda - when Japan gained Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and the Habomai Islets - the entire chain was ceded to Japan in 1875 in return for south Sakhalin Island, which was regained in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War. Although the USSR and Japan signed a Neutrality Pact in 1941, as the war in the Far East drew ended in August 1945, Moscow invaded South Sakhalin and the entire the Kuril Islands chain. In 1956, the two countries signed a Peace Declaration. However, their dispute over the Kuriles, prevented them from signing a formal peace treaty. To this day, Russia and Japan have still not signed an agreement due to the Kuril Islands, which are called the 'Northern Territories' by Japan. But while there had been some sign of progress in recent years, especially following talks between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Russia seems to have become more hardline. This has been especially the case since the start of the war in Ukraine.

[],False,,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,"May be you should [read more](https://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/OP334.html). The general points for the usefulness of MBT-level armoured vehicles are as follow

Light infantry and light/medium armor (i.e. IFVs) are even more vulnerable than tanks and lack firepower; only heavy armor has speed, armor, and protection all in one package.  
  
Heavy armor units can be trained down to fight in light infantry environments (i.e. think ABCTs still have infantry, and they don't have to deploy alongside tanks), but light infantry can't be trained to fight in heavy armor environments (since they don't have armor in the first place)

The mobility disadvantage of heavy armor is overrated: there are few places medium armor (like IFVs) can go that heavy armor can't.  
  
Yes, tanks are vulnerable to ATGMs, but APCs and IFVs are even less survivable, and helicopters are vulnerable to MANPADs. In other words, if people think tanks are vulnerable, then so is everything you'd want to transport infantry in. Light infantry without transports are slow and have even less protection.  
  
Tanks can provide responsive fire support with less collateral damage than artillery and airpower.

Modern heavy armor can be defeated by ATGMs, yes but actually not that many other things. ATGMs are really heavy and there are not all that many in an infantry unit.  
  
\- Light/medium APC are even more vulnerable to ATGMs and even smaller anti-tank rockets. RPG-7 today will probably not do anything to the sides of MBT but will still threaten light APCs. They are also vulnerable to top-attack cluster artillery munitions.  
  
\- Light infantry has no protected mobility on the advance against even small arms or artillery fire. Their only saving grace is that they can disperse very widely and ammunition is limited so some will survive.  
  
Still, there are marginal improvements that can be made. Infantry need an APC/IFV that is as heavily armoured as a tank. There are probably utility for a vehicle with MBT armour but armed with longer range ATGM.",380c315d02157162237ccfc32b2565287f383c42,True,False,,,,,0,1648516772,,0,{},i2idcn2,False,t3_tqaarh,False,True,t1_i2ib0gg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqaarh/ukraine_megathread_march_28/i2idcn2/,1648516788,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648487972.0,,

There are plausible reasons the US could have gone into Afghanistan outside of just taking care of 9/11 and Bin Laden/Al Qaeda.

The best analogy I have come across that accurately describes Taiwan and the KMT is that in 1949 the KMT came across the strait and placed the flag of the ROC over the entire island, basically attempting to smother the native population's ability to determine it's own future.

Taiwan had been under ROC administration since 1945 with the Japanese surrender, the KMT didn't just show up for the first time in 1949. Also, the fact that the sovereignty was unsettled at that point was really a technicality. The Cairo and Potsdam declarations already stipulated that the territory of Taiwan would be returned by Japan to the ROC, it would just take a treaty to formalize it.

Basically in 1949, Taiwan's status was not really in question. It administered by the ROC, although it was technically still under Japanese sovereignty since a peace treaty was still in the works. The ambiguity only comes into play with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, where Japan formally relinquished Taiwan as previously agreed, but due to how the Chinese civil war had progressed there was no representative of China that was a party to the Treaty.

Unfortunately this entire war contains a veritable laundry list of the kinds of reasons soldiers in WW1 and WW2 executed German POWs, in particular the Russia bombing of Ukrainian cities is exactly the kind of atrocious act that can spur Ukrainian soldiers to hurt/kill Russian POWs as reprisals.
