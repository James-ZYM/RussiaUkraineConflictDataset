[],,,Timely_Jury,,,,,,"Dumb nonsense. I'd argue that America's Middle East policy is best understood by Hanlon's razor-""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."" The Iraq War did not happen because of some diabolical plan to steal oil or maintain Saudi hegemony, but simply because Bush and his surrounding coterie of neocons *were genuinely deluded enough to actually believe* that the Iraqis would bow before and kiss the American flag after being invaded, hard as it is to believe. Afghanistan was a revenge fantasy with no plan beyond getting revenge. In both cases, the number of armed individuals required to stabilise both places was far greater than available (a ratio of 1:50 is the minimum, which means that ~1.1 million soldiers were required altogether, a number impossible for the US to deploy to the Middle East). Thus, the Americans won the wars but lost the peace. 

The US-Israeli alliance dates back to the Cold War, when the new Arab nationalist regimes which came to power in the newly independent Arab states were ideologically and practically more aligned with the USSR. It is continued because Israel is a highly effective and valuable partner. Their military is *undoubtedly* the strongest in the region, and the same goes for their technological prowess. And that is not to mention the moral argument of ensuring the protection of a community which only numbers 14 million and has been facing abuse and extermination attempts for thousands of years now.

Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq were destroyed by *sectarian war*, and the main reason behind *that* is *Iran*. In fact, if you are looking for a diabolical mastermind behind the Middle East's chaos, it is Iran. They have cultivated an extensive network of Shia terrorist proxies which keep these places in a state of perpetual civil war. *This* is why the Iran deal (JCPOA) was an unmitigated disaster, and Biden's attempts to resurrect it will be looked upon in the future as one of the worst foreign policy decisions ever made by a US president.

Saudi Arabia and its allied GCC member states are useful partners for the US in a region filled with anti-American despots and a largely anti-American population. I must also add that the old, racist stereotypes about Saudi Arabia are woefully out of date. Under the dynamic leadership of MbS, the country's pace of modernisation puts that of Turkey under Atatürk to shame. Saudi Arabia will continue to become a more important partner for the US when it comes to countering Iran's malignant ambitions for the region.

And finally, Arab unification  is dead. Even Arabs recognise that. Every attempt has been a failure, and the idea is now (correctly) seen as one used by pathetic, old-fashioned demagogues to gain a few more supporters. If there is to be any unification, it will have to begin with *economic* unification, like the EU. The GCC is already a successful example. *Political* unification can come later, and it might not be necessary at all.",,,,,,,,,1645829791,,,{},hyfz39g,False,t3_sz8omt,False,True,t3_sz8omt,/r/geopolitics/comments/sz8omt/an_offhand_theory_about_us_middle_east_policy/hyfz39g/,,1,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645800991.0,[],text,t2_ci5y8txg,False,False,[],1654234063.0,True

[],,,PausedForVolatility,,,,,,"Ukraine has long since known that it can't beat Russia in a straight-up fight. It's currently up against something like a third of Russia's total military power (barring strategic weapons) and is losing ground. Its military is too much smaller, has older equipment, doesn't have as much combat experience, etc.   
  
As a result of that, Ukraine recognized the likely failure of a conventional war and appears to be intending to hybridize conflict. We're seeing a conventional conflict right now, but in a conventional conflict this last-second drafting of citizens is functionally useless. Rather, Ukraine seems to have been spending its resources developing semi-trained civilians to carry the war onto the second phase: armed insurrection.  
  
The idea seems to be that a professional soldier thinks like a soldier. Operations are carried out in terms that make sense to a soldier. An untrained (or undertrained) civilian with a gun doesn't think or act like that. They'll do things that don't make any strategic sense and that will frequently catch professional soldiers off-guard. Sometimes it will pan out; it often won't (remember, it's untrained civilians up against actual soldiers), but it will pan out enough. After all, the soldier has to get it right every single time. The guy planting the IED only has to get it right that one. And there's potentially far more of the latter than the former.   
  
It is, of course, totally possible that the planned insurrection never materializes. It's possible the FSB/GRU have penetrated enough of the support network to render them functionally useless. It's possible that Ukrainian civilians, while desiring to fight for their homes, will be cowed into submission by overwhelming force. It's possible they'll find the lack of direct military support from the West demoralizing and will give up. It's also possible they'll double down and ensure the history books talk of a Ukrainian Resistance like they do the French Resistance.   
  
But let's also not forget incidents like Snake Island or the destructive of the bridge near Kharkhiv. Acts of heroism and sacrifice in the service of a nation have a tendency to etch themselves into the soul of a nation. I imagine just about every culture has their own version of Thermopylae, or the Alamo, or the St Patrick Brigade, or the Swiss Guard.

While it is true that there is often direct causative factors for behavior, many other times trying to analyze why humans groups do the things they do is kind of like asking why your favorite color is blue. Like, how can you even begin to explain that? I know people can come up with rationalizations for why they chose a certain color as their favorite, but does that make it true?

I also don’t think it’s off to have a pessimistic view of human behavior. And sociologists absolutely would agree with me. My views are largely reflective of psychological research like that of Kahneman et Al. Human beings are driven by intuition alongside some specks of rationality. 

A manor pillar of western society is its focus on rationality. This is what makes it unique. Precisely because most other cultures are decidedly *not* rational. 

I think these analyses that attribute political attitudes to simplistic causative factors tend to be mostly futile. Human action is largely unknowable.

Basically the idea of a nuclear deterrent is the ability to inflict damage on your opponent that is so unacceptable that no matter their goals they'd be apprehensive or scared to initiate an attack. It works on the basis that 1) you have a nuclear weapon capacity 2) have a credible ability to use it (political will and a delivery mechanism e.g. functioning missiles) and 3) the opponent believes the damage it will inflict is unacceptable. 

In the case of the UK - I believe the government maintains the 'Trident' system, which arms submarines with nuclear weapons. Since submarines are harder to track and to destroy than a stationary base with nuclear missiles - they have a greater deterrent capacity. An attacker of the UK would always be aware and terrified of the potential retaliation from anywhere on the seas. 

There is a lot more to deterrent theory, plenty of criticisms of its effectiveness and of governments failures to safely maintain their nuclear stockpiles. Regardless, the theory of nuclear deterrence is widely accepted by many International Relations scholars and is credited with preventing the breakout of 'hot' war between the US and the USSR during the cold war (you probably heard about MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction - which largely encapsulates the idea of nuclear deterrence).

[],,,[deleted],,,,,dark,"What's happening in Ukraine is turning into yet another Washington DC foreign policy blunder. As an American, it's really frustrating to see Ukraine abandoned after Democrats and Republicans spent the last 8 years making such a big deal out of the conflict.

Ukraine doesn't have the strength to go on any offensive alone. They could try, but it'll be violent and deadly, and Russia would increase it's aggression. By remaining in defensive positions, you force Russia to make a choice about being aggressive again. 

Ukraine's military position is strong enough to make life difficult for Russia if it tries to replace the government and subdue the population. If the top leaders of the current Ukrainian government can remain alive, and if the Ukrainian military is ready to fight, and the people are willing to riot against a Russian puppet government, Russia won't be able to create a new way of life for people in Ukraine. The situation would turn into a humanitarian crisis that Russia has no experience solving.

When you take a step back, it appears the fighting is unnecessary, and Ukraine shouldn't even be in this position. The West failed Ukraine. Either give Ukraine the right weapons to defend themselves, or use diplomacy to secure the nation. The West was unable to do either.

When you take another step back, from the American perspective, it seems the US government should focus on its own problems and solve the domestic inflation crisis instead. But if you view the Ukrainian crisis as part of a larger battle of civilizations between West/Europe with democratic principles against Russia and authoritarianism, then this event is critical. Personally, I'm more of an idealist, and I believe the West should integrate Ukraine into Europe and not tolerate Russian aggression. 

Now, what's the best way to achieve this given the facts of today? On the spectrum of diplomacy and military, you could go the more peaceful way or the more deadly way. If you believe by any means necessary, then you need to consider all options in the spectrum. 

If Russia doesn't want Ukraine in NATO, and if a likely alternative is a Russian puppet in Kyiv, Ukraine should negotiate a cease-fire on those terms instead going on the counter offensive with their military. The West should give up the idea of using the Ukrainian military to fight Russia and focus on integrating Ukraine into the European economy.",,,,,,,,,1645819801,,,{},hyfa1xn,False,t3_t0p1yw,False,True,t3_t0p1yw,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0p1yw/why_is_ukraine_not_taking_the_fight_to_the_enemy/hyfa1xn/,,0,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645791001.0,,,,,,[],1654136078.0,

Yeah there's a lot of really uninformed takes on reddit.  For one, remember how weeks and weeks ago everyone started getting nervous because Russia seemed like they were staging for some kind of military action by moving a ton of troops and a ton of equipment right on the border of Ukraine?  That's not happening at all with Taiwan.  China can't just invade Taiwan at the drop of a hat, there's a lot of preparation that is needed to pull something like that off.  Preparation that isn't happening.

The argument that they will coordinate seems to simply be a case of ""well Russia is a bad guy and doing an invasion.  China is a bad guy so I guess they'll invade too."" which is... shaky to say the least.  

&gt;In a way, Taiwan and Ukraine are somewhat ""siblings"" in their historical status and relationship with China and Russia respectively.

Only in a very vague sense.  The histories and political situation between the two are very different really.  For instance (and this is just one of many examples) both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) claim the entirety of both regions.  Taiwan says that mainland China should be part of the Republic of China.  The People's Republic of China says that both Taiwan and mainland China should be part of the PRC.  There are also no military alliances with Ukraine and countries in NATO in the way that there are in Taiwan.  If Taiwan gets attacked lots of countries will come to their rescue in a way that we aren't seeing with Ukraine.  There's no reason for the PRC to try to invade Taiwan right now, this tense moment doesn't position them any better to do that than any other time.  This sort of falls into the same idea of ""bad guy is antagonistic towards these guys, and these other bad guys are antagonistic towards these other guys so they're pretty much the same"".

Because Ukraine desires integration with the EU while Russia fundamentally distrusts the EU. It's similar to how China couldn't make Taiwan an ally. One is West leaning, the other is not. Plenty of history and politics involved in the reasons for how this came to be. The fall of the Soviet Union in particular was crucial to the emergence of Ukraine as a separate country and in the same way China views Taiwan as the result of Japanese and American intervention, Russia views the emergence of Ukraine as the result of a color revolution - the first of many in post-Soviet Eastern Europe - supported or sponsored by the West at the depth of Soviet weakness and the height of liberal triumph.

In other words, Russia associates the loss of Ukraine with Western expansion in post-Soviet Eastern Europe and as such, it cannot tolerate a West friendly Ukraine. But Ukraine is precisely that, and so the ""brothers"" narrative is irrelevant. If anything, Russia sees Ukraine as a ""brother"" that ""betrayed"" it for the West. This is even more dangerous, as in the case of China and Taiwan, where the shared ethnic and cultural bonds become fuel for even more resentment. This is because ""betrayal"" is ultimately more damaging, psychologically, than the ""natural"" hostility of alien powers. Russia expects nothing from the likes of France and Germany, but it expected more from Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, particularly Slavic republics intimately tied to Russia's identity as a nation. It's this expectation that has caused Russia's seemingly irrational obsession with regaining Ukraine and other former Soviet states, in the same manner as China's obsession with Taiwan.",,,,,,,,,1645813467,,,{},hyetlvg,False,t3_t16w9a,False,False,t1_hye7uk5,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hyetlvg/,,42,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645784667.0,[],text,t2_105wcs,False,False,[],1654071287.0,

[],,,guebja,,,,,,"&gt; Why couldn’t Russia make Ukraine an ally?

They tried. Forcibly.

Yanukovych was a somewhat pro-Russian (though primarily self-serving and corrupt) politician, but he still intended to sign an association agreement with the EU.

Russia considered that a ""betrayal"" from a supposedly friendly head of state, so in 2013, they launched heavy trade sanctions against Ukraine.

Yanukovych quickly capitulated, effectively suspending his intentions of signing the EU association agreement and promising to forge closer relations with Russia and its Eurasian Union project, instead.

This was what sparked the Euromaidan protests and ultimately led to Yanukovych's downfall, ironically paving the way for far more strongly pro-western leadership in Ukraine.

So, to answer your question:

Russia can't easily make Ukraine an ally, because it expects subservience and compliance from allies in what it considers its rightful sphere of influence.

It does offer things in return -- economic support, military support for autocrats needing to suppress their population, and a blind eye for human rights violations -- but what it expects is a kind of relationship that simply doesn't jive well with democratic nations.",,,,,,,,,1645811851,,,{},hyep9yp,False,t3_t16w9a,False,False,t1_hye7uk5,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hyep9yp/,,55,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645783051.0,[],text,t2_7rbz4,False,False,[],1654055172.0,

[],False,,Macketter,,,,,,"&gt;But as nominal GDP increases, the difference between nominal and PPP decreases, so it's not a meaningful data point - if China's nominal GDP per capita doubled, there's no chance it's GDP in PPP terms would do the same.

True but I don't think PPP and nominal GDP for China will converge for the foreseeable future. It is true that PPP growth for China should be less than nominal GDP but that also depends on other factors such as exchange rate. PPP is still a relevant data point depending on what you want to measure. It doesn't make sense to say PPP is not a meaningful data point just because as nominal GPD increases, it will converge to PPP value. What is important is using the correct measurement depending on the context of the question.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With respect to military spending, the same applies - maintaining large standing armies is far more expensive in countries with higher GDP per capita. If comparing military capabilities today, then there are much more meaningful ways of doing it than via PPP.

The question here is how much military capabilities can the country's economy afford, something along the line of if China spends 2% of its GDP on the military how much can it buy compared to the USA spending. Using nominal GDP also doesn't make sense, case in point Russia. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The reason I called this out is that it's by no means the first time I've seen people misusing PPP and creating flawed narratives by quoting it in situations where it makes no sense to even bring it up (for example aggregating China's PPP per capita and claiming that somehow makes their economy bigger than the US's).

But China's PPP GDP is still useful when comparing their economy with the US's. Again it depends on what you want to measure. Amount of goods China consume, I would argue PPP is the correct measure. How important is the Chinese market to a foreign company or how much influence China can buy with their money, then nominal GDP is better.",ec7e7c773de9252ae5f97f8ce106972837a62571,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645810755,,0.0,{},hyemdc3,False,t3_t0k28j,False,True,t1_hyeavax,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0k28j/chinas_maximum/hyemdc3/,1645810769.0,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645781955.0,[],text,t2_8oxkh3j,False,False,,,

The reason is that Russia has been on a path towards dedollarization since about 2014, when it got hit with Western sanctions the last time.

Russian export settlements in USD made up almost 95% in 2014, but since then, it lowered considerably, it now only makes up around 25% of all Russian export settlements.

What did they replace it with?

Well initially, they wanted to do it in rubles but that plan really hit hurdles very fast. The CNY is also used for a considerable amount of exports to Chinese but not for the rest. Instead, they chose the euro as a generalist currency.

Around 65% of all Russian export settlements are now done in euros, which props up the Euro as a trade and settlement currency and gives the Eurozone weight.

If SWIFT exclusions really do hit, European banks will be hard hit and all transactions using the euro will suddenly be much harder to do. It does not help the euro as a currency.

Russias SPFS system will also get a startup kick, which SWIFT in itself would not want. Nobody wants a rival to expand into your market and it might even bolster the Chinese to expand their CIPS as well, considering they have been wanting to offer a SWIFT alternative as well.

The whole charge him for it is also extremely dismissive. Part of why people mock sanctions so much is because up until now, they've been purposely toothless. Even now, the reticience to target SWIFT is telling that the US hasn't even fully used their financial hard powers and can increase the intensity, but cancelling Nord stream and the widespread banking targets are still fairly severe.   


The reason for this approach is also obvious: there are tremendous implications for engaging in an intercontinental land war with Russia, and it creates tremendous risk to upend what has been nearly a century of relative peace -- obviously we've seen horrific wars and military atrocities, but nothing approaching \*total war\*. And when dealing with a nuclear power, it would be far more ideal if they could assasinate their own leader or deal with their own issues internally. Russia is not in the same place as NK with respect to Sino relations, and if Europe and US truly committed to full sanctions, Russians wouldn't even be able to prop up the ruble since their FOREX reserves of USD and EUR, likely almost entirely in bonds, would become useless.   


I'm not sure how hard the West will commit to full economic sanctions as they're a double-edged sword, but complete intelligence and resource support for Ukraine, complete financial isolation for Russia, and a reimagining of the value of NATO, which many viewed obsolete as recently as the aughts, is a step in the right direction for the West and one I doubt Putin is taking lightly.",a1932537d1a9ca6199f796d06e9509e2f62830ff,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645807376,,0.0,{},hyedew3,False,t3_t16w9a,False,True,t1_hye7uk5,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hyedew3/,1645807390.0,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645778576.0,[],text,t2_bh9ym,False,False,,,

Frankly, I cannot disagree more. The past 8 elections have been won on domestic platforms, not foreign policy ones. The last president with a coherent foreign strategy was HW Bush.

Every president since Clinton has been more nationalist than his predecessor. Biden is even more nationalist than Trump in terms of the policies he has actually implemented. Only difference is that he's doing it with a smile and good PR instead.

It's honestly shocking you think you would know more about the US government than someone who actually has to vote them into office.

Depends on how you define evil and madman. If you are familiar with Realism, I think that while it's dangerous to overfit and simplify everything to fit a Realist paradigm but it can be used to explain quite a lot, and in Russia's case it feels as though the policymakers themselves believe the world works in a Realist paradigm. So I think it's safe to view the overarching reason for Russia's invasion as that: they really did have ""security concerns"" regarding Ukraine and mixed with the paranoia of the people at the top, Putin wanting to leave a legacy and a general sense that time is against them is what probably drove the invasion. 

That is to say: the Russians well and truly see themselves as cornered and believe if they do not eliminate the threat of a west facing Ukraine now, it'll be used against them in the future

Does that justify their invasion in moral terms? In my opinion, absolutely not, but at the same time it is important to understand the motivations of actors. No one invaded a country just because they're evil after all, even evil people will have specific objectives

Now to address whether or not he is a madman --  well, I understand the reasoning behind his invasion (or at least I think I do) but the decision to invade is an extraordinarily stupid one with heavy consequences for relatively little gain and it goes against his usual profile which is more methodical and patient.

[],,,Arcbleast,,,,,,"I think China is biggest limit will not be due to recourses or population, but rather its internal politics within the CCP (or CPC now a days?) 

The reason being is that, due to its current way of politics (which in away rather close to the old Soviet Union or imperial system, ironically). It is too corrupted to keep doing the right things as it relies on all relevant persons to have a conscience to do the right thing or too stubborn to commit to changes (as it is ironically, a very resilience system).

The one party system is interestingly both the way to rise and to drag the efficiency in their ""performance"", since China unlike the most western centuries, will double down on their set paths and move a significant portion of recourses to reach the goal by brute forcing it. Assuming that they got it right, they will perform better than others, but if they are wrong, then they will suffer the consequence far worse than most of the west. 

To answer your question (i.e. Can all major cities in China can reach the same GDP per Capita as Hong Kong?) we can look at Hong Kong now, which is now under heavy influence of China. There is a great amount of mismanagement of recourses, including land, water, financial and even human (in terms of government officials being placed in fields that are not excel in), you ca say Hong Kong is not reaching its full potential due to its management. Many recourses is locked behind the government decisions which strive to be more in line with the CCP's (or CPC's) interest. which often end up to be a loss. In that sense, I will take the assumption that China is unlikely to look into individual cities and what they are actually capable to assign roles. Rather they would move the recourse to where they think should be good (even in actual fact, it won't be the case). which can be quite ineffective in most cases.

\*^(Please note that I use HK as an example because I am more familiar with the place than the rest of China, and also because it used to be the leading GDP drive within that region for China.)

I would also note that due to the way that the regime works, a sizable amount of recourses has to go to maintain the status quo, in exchange of innovation (i.e. future potential), I would say that, China realistically can only reach about less than half of Hong Kong's GDP per capita at best, assuming it's vast land and population can cover for any recourse issues and not factoring in any external influences.

So, my guess is that if they potential is 100%, they will reach less than 50% within the next few decade.",,,,,,,,,1645805239,,,{},hye7tn4,False,t3_t0k28j,False,True,t3_t0k28j,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0k28j/chinas_maximum/hye7tn4/,,-1,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645776439.0,[],text,t2_3gy8h4qi,False,False,[],1653986535.0,

&gt;Some very early impressions of the last two days. It's an operation with maximalist war aims, and Moscow's thinking on this war seems to have been colored by war optimism. It looked as though Russian forces were expecting a quicker UKR military collapse and easier gains.  
&gt;  
&gt;Early campaign to knock out Ukrainian air defenses and air force had mixed results, Russian aerospace forces aren't particularly practiced at SEAD or DEAD. Most of the strikes in the opening phase were via cruise missiles. UKR air force still has some aircraft up.  
&gt;  
&gt;A brazen heliborne assault to take Hostomel airport with a small airborne element was a puzzling move. I doubt the goal was to land more airborne at a contested airport easily covered by artillery and MLRS. Likely they expected to hold out for ground reinforcements.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far we've seen only a fraction of the Russian force arrayed for the operation. Unclear if Russian forces reached initial objectives, but best estimate is they expected more rapid gains &amp; less resistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian forces seem to be avoiding use of massed fires, except maybe around Kharkiv, focusing on trying to make a speedy advance. Expect they will revert to much larger use of fires when frustrated. Not seeing much in the way of cyber and less EW effects than many anticipated.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian forces are mainly sticking to the road network (as in 2014-2015). Early advances made by recon troops, but driving along roads left support units open to ambushes. Already signs of urban warfare and firefights in cities.  
&gt;  
&gt;There has been heavy fighting around Kharkiv and in Sumi. Russian forces tried to advance past Okhtyrka, and it looks like they're attempting to go around Kharkiv. There is also an advance west of Symi to Konotop. This is a very incomplete picture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian forces entered from Belarus and went through Chernobyl exclusion zone to Dymer. Early signs of fighting on outskirts of Kyiv in Obolonskyi distict today. They're clearly going for the capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Main breakout appears to be in the south from Crimea. Russian forces pushed to Kherson, and Melitopol. There's sustained fighting for Kherson still and around Antonovsky bridge. Some early signs they may have entered Mykolaiv, but probably just a recon element.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian forces retain significant quantitative and qualitative superiority. UKR forces have demonstrated resolve &amp; resilience. Russian conventional overmatch, such as it is, may not translate into attaining their maximalist political aims. This is just the opening of the war.

&gt;The one thing I will add to my earlier thread, is that we should take care making assumptions on how this war will progress based on the opening 24-48 hours. The Russian military clearly tried something. I think it at best yielded mixed results for them. They will adjust.  
&gt;  
&gt;What's clear is that is that if Moscow had hopes of quick and easy gains, they were terribly optimistic. My main concern is that over time the Russian military may revert to heavy use of firepower, and this will result in immense destruction, and large civilian casualties.",0e779b05d4d95336caafead6d00802d769de6028,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645804169,,0.0,{},hye52xs,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hye52xs/,1645804182.0,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645775369.0,[],text,t2_4ier2,False,False,,,

This on top of the obvious backlash against a racist police force.

As for Trumpism, I suspect there’s some similar motivations, but turned reactionary. Though many of these people are middle class Boomers, they probably are downwardly mobile.

[],,,Justjoinedstillcool,,,,,,"Most of our perspective is a matter of framing.  If you go to a party and walk in and everyone is wearing swimwear, you will immediately wonder if YOU are wrong, and this is somehow a pool party.  However if you walk into a room and everyone is naked, you will think these people are wrong and weird.  The second scenario is outside your framing of acceptable.

The western world has absolute control of the media, culturally and news both.  They have shaped our idea of what is acceptable.  Being openly racist?  Not acceptable under any circumstances (despite it being the default state of 80% of the worlds population, basically everyone BUT the west).

But we never explore that concept, instead we simply, by decree declare that racism will not be tolerated and questions like is it ok to be racist, are treated as proof of racism and so on and so forth.  This creates blind spots that western (liberal) ideology cannot understand.  East Asia is the most racist place on Earth.  It's horrific.  What they do to each other is bad, what they do to dark skinned people is worse.  But since the western order can't make that fit into our system (more here in one paragraph), we ignore it, and things like China's human rights abuses, India's class conflicts or Japan's history of terror.

Western ideology would tell you that if someone or an entire society was racist they be pure evil, and/or genocidal.  After all a racist society gave us American slavery and the Holocaust (the two most prominent examples among white racist history), and so our minds become trapped in this box.  Either you are racist and you will be evil, or you are not evil, so you can't be racist.  Despite plenty of evidence tot he contrary, ie modern Japan has strict immigration, but no plans to colonize the Philippines, an Indian man man refuse to marry a lower caste woman, but that doesn't mean he'll murder her.

The same is true of violence.  By and large our society has been stripped of violence.  This is not a good thing.  From school age up, we are taught that violence is not the answer.  But as anyone who has ever been attacked can tell you, sometimes it is the only answer.  For those exceptions, we again try and frame it with paradoxes to keep our perspective.  Things like learn martial arts to defend yourself.  There is no defending yourself in a fight, unless all you do is block until the guy passes out from exhaustion.  You must strike back, which is really attacking.  But the unfortunate truth is that the person who punches first will.ein the majority of fights.  And if you think your cause is just, you should have to wait for the other guy to hit you in order for you to start attacking.

We've been ruined by safety and prosperity and a 3 lifetimes of movies where the underdog wins after letting the bad guy throw the first punch.  Our ancestors were honest with themselves, life is a struggle.  Conflict is inevitable and unless you hate your own cause ( ????), You need to win.  Being capable of violence is seen as threatening, but it doesn't guarantee you will.gonhime.and best your wife or shoot up a school, and it sure as hell doesn't prevent it either.

And so we are back to Putin.  I'm sure if you asked a western liberal, they'd tell you that Ukraine did nothing wrong, that Putin is greedy or power hungry, or foolish.  But he's not.  He's one of the greatest leaders alive today (he does a LOT, with a weak hand), who doesn't want to see the world destroyed.  I doubt he is crazy either.  I'm sure there is a scenario where he would use nukes.  I'm also sure there's times where he probably should.use nukes and won't.

As far as I have read, the best game theory on this seems to favor a conventional attacker who can achieve a quick military objective and then defend a *fait accomplit*. Once the nuclear card is seriously played, the idea is that it starts to freeze conventional conflict. So if you can take something quickly, but it would take opponents a long time to retake it, there is the idea that playing the nuclear card is a strong option from that position. It is better suited to frustrating those engaged in the longer grinding process of retaking something. But nuclear game theory seems conjectural at best. And of course, while overrunning the Baltics would be quick, the build up to do so would be less rapid, and definitely noticed.

I'd say the danger here for Putin is in possibly galvanizing the West to start making the sacrifices needed to manifest the West's true latent power, which is still quite stunning. Russia could be permanently blockaded, as could any nation that helped alleviate that blockade, such as China. Russia could weather that, but its long term demise would be assured so long as the West maintained its will. It would be a contest of wills. 

China would be destroyed if the West included them in this kind of hermetic containment. I suppose the nuclear card could be played yet again, though it is strange to envision China or Russia threatening to nuke Los Angeles or New York if they aren't allowed access to world markets. But again, nuclear game theory is guesswork at best.

The USA is a particularly bad approximation of it, given how it's already taken over by oligarchic interests - where open bribery is allowed, just as long as it's called 'lobbying'.

There are better implementations that are closer to the ideal to be made exemplars, however the truth is most of these are just succeeding because they are much smaller hence more able to adapt, and don't have as much room/many weakpoints (scale due to hierarchy from organizing a bigger population) and $$$ sloshing around to allow open takeover by special interests.

My point is, every system will be gamed and taken over by special interests (due to greed/laziness) over time as long as preventive mechanisms don't exist, or the populous isn't well educated on this fact and complacent (can't think of any large population that satisfies those conditions)[you might even say, democracy cannot exist in the long run without a population meeting these conditions]. 

Democracy is 'losing' the fight around the world, because the world is being shown that the current implementations of it are severely lacking, at least the larger more well known ones, at least compared to decades before (although that was mainly because they were still under the process of being taken over by special interests) now allowing openings for alternative schools of thought to emerge, some exploitable by more authoritarian types.

I hate to admit it, but perhaps the best fate for Ukraine would be to just accept a puppet regime until new geopolitical conditions allow for a better and more peaceful resolution of the issue. It will take decades of course, but isn't it better for the lives of regular people to live decades of peace under a fake government rather than decades of guerilla fights and areas split intro warlords?",,,,,,,,,1645789637,,,{},hydbjci,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_hy7b57d,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hydbjci/,,1,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645760837.0,[],text,t2_1c05ba19,False,False,[],1653862401.0,

Yes, Germany made a mistake in becoming addicted to Russian gas. They miscalculated. But honestly, geopolitics are hard. Mistakes are normal. All of the major players have made mistakes.

For the US, Ukraine is not a vital interest. They have no red line, because even if Ukraine falls and becomes a complete Russian puppet, it won't change much on the grand scale of things. Arguably the US is even in a win-win situation, either Ukraine joins NATO and gets out of Russian orbit, or Ukraine is invaded and Russia suffers a heavy diplomatic cost.

On the other hand, Ukraine is a red line for Russia as they've made abundantly clear, so they're in fact fully willing to go to war to preserve what they believe is their vital interests.

Therefore, putting US troops in Ukraine would not have prevented the invasion and would only have heightened the risk of a major war to an unacceptable level. For no reason since Ukraine isn't a vital interest for the US.

&gt; Stop telling me I was right and listen to what I'm saying now. My recommendations follow:

&gt; - Support Ukraine militarily, immediately, everything but boots on the ground. All weapons, intel, cyber.
&gt; - Bankrupt Putin's war machine. Freeze &amp; seize Russia's finances &amp; those of him and his gang.
&gt; - Kick Russia out of every intl &amp; financial institution. PACE, Interpol, etc
&gt; - Recall all ambassadors from Russia. There is no point in talking. The new unified message is ""stop or be isolated completely"".
&gt; - Ban all elements of Putin's global propaganda machine. Turn them off, shut them down, send them home. Stop helping the dictator spread lies &amp; hate.
&gt; - Expose and act against Putin's lackeys in the free world. If Schröder and his ilk continue to work for Putin, bring charges. Ask the owners &amp; advertisers of networks platforming Putin propagandists like Carlson why they allow it. 
&gt; - Replace Russian oil &amp; gas. Pressure OPEC, increase production, reopen Keystone. You can't save the planet if you don't save the people on it.
&gt; - Acknowledge there will be costs, sacrifices. We waited to long, the price is high, but it will only get higher. It's time to fight.

You're being naive and don't understand the man. Even in the totally unrealistic scenario of NATO forces intervening and pushing the Russians back all it would take is one tactical nuke to stop an advance and freeze the situation for fear he might go ballistic. If you'll excuse the pun? 

I once read a story about a man who hated his neighbor who he constantly fought with. So he burned down the man's home. The thing being that their houses were side by side and attached as a single building. So it burned down his own home too. But he felt it was all worth it to hurt his enemy. 

People like that do exist. The story of Russian history is a story of suffering. A Putin will cut off his own nose to spite his face. Failing to recognize what he is, wishful thinking and treating him like a normal national leader has led to this great tragedy and suffering for Ukraine.  That's how I see it anyway. And I now better understand how Hitler and Stalin were able to achieve all the horrible things they did seeing a modern day example of it play out before my eyes.

[],,,Beginning_Beginning,,,,,,"&gt;Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union in exchange for a worthless promise from Russia to respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. 

While in practice this might true, it reveals the spirit of a geopolitical paradigm that is deliberately broken and which is ultimately responsible for what is happening in Ukraine:

First, it assumes that nuclear capabilities are the only true deterrent against invasion from a superpower. Would it be OK to give nukes to Georgia or the Baltic states? Who's to say then that countries like Venezuela or Nicaragua should also have their own nukes in case the US wants to invade them? Ukraine have nuclear weapons does not address the underlying imbalances in power. 

Unless you argue that any of these countries (and others) can obtain their own nuclear weapons and contribute to nuclear proliferation, I don't see how the assertion ""Putin has dealt the single greatest blow to nuclear non-proliferation since the USSR's collapse"" has any significant value, moreover when recent history has already shown us that countries without nukes - Libya, Iraq - were much less of a military threat and easier targets for invasion than countries with nuclear weapons, or the potential to obtain them in the foreseeable future such as North Korea or even Iran. 

Going back to the idea of the imbalance of power, everyone's wary of sending military troops against Russia because this might trigger a nuclear war. If Russia didn't have nuclear weapons, then an appropriate military response could be mustered, but instead of saying ""Ukraine should have nukes"" no one is saying ""Russia shouldn't have nukes"", and no one is saying it because the only (hypothetical) way that Russia would surrender their nukes is that everyone else - France, US, UK, Israel, China, India, Pakistan - surrendered theirs and this is something that these countries don't have a plan on doing because of the political and military leverage it gives them. They rather maintain a status quo where Russia can invade with impunity to another one in which countries can team up against a bully superpower without risking the annihilation of the world. 

Without nuclear weapons, the whole idea having a UN Security Council with members holding veto power becomes obsolete. Who's up for that? Not their current members, I assume.",,,,,,,,,1645768701,,,{},hycjjsr,False,t3_szvxx3,False,False,t1_hy66i7w,/r/geopolitics/comments/szvxx3/how_ukraine_was_betrayed_in_budapest/hycjjsr/,,3,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645739901.0,[],text,t2_24531htf,False,False,[],1653754392.0,

Ukraine needs to embrace its brotherhood with Russians and Russian culture, but reject domination by the Russian elite. Of course, it is too late for that now, but there will likely come again a time when they have to make this choice.

One of the last things he did before resigning was direct nuclear threats toward Clinton about Chechnya but it was too little too late and he left office with virtually no support among Russians. Immediately following that was the reintroduction of the Soviet national anthem and Putin chipping away at democratic reforms and jailing critics while enjoying legendary status and approval among Russians. Russians were on their way to recovering lost glory and status in the world and they had the nuclear weapons to facilitate it. NATO's role in Bosnia, Kosovo and Georgia is just an excuse being thrown around now for a long-standing and long time coming return of recalcitrant and aggressive Russians and to look for reasons for that in the west and in western actions is missing the point, in my opinion.

It's like when people blame western leaders for looking at China's human rights abuses, militarism or their economic behavior and look for ways to apply blame to western actions or saying western nations aren't playing their cards right or whatever without ever considering why somebody like Xi Jinping is in power and enjoys massive support among Chinese.",,,,,,,,,1645760897,,,{},hyc51m2,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,False,t1_hybxf06,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyc51m2/,,8,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645732097.0,[],text,t2_2sbadiz,False,False,[],1653701033.0,

Truthfully, nobody knows how to game out conventional conflict plus nuclear threats, as Putin has invoked. The one, somewhat proven, strategy the West has is the Cold War playbook. And I think that is what gets pulled out, against Russia and China. This is a long game, requiring careful nuanced thinking, and not heady emotional impulsivity.

Western observers need to calm down and gather themselves. This is a marathon and not a sprint; and never let the Russian bear distract you from the Chinese. Most importantly, the West and its major allies have to sit down and work out fundamental divisions among themselves, first. If a long term formula for a retooled and renewed Liberal International Order that not only all the Western powers can live with, but that will be attractive to the rest of the world, cannot be found and articulated, then maybe the West had better give up on the project altogether. In such a case, it's back to classic geopolitics, though this time with nukes, and we should just give Russia the post-Soviet space and make nice with them.

If anything, you flip Russia against China should China not stall out and seem poised to outperform on the upside. But Putin is no dummy: he knows that the West just turns on him after China is dealt with. There really is no compromising with the Liberal International Order in the very long term. Like a shark, it must keep moving until it covers the globe, or die.

So maybe this will have to be about the LIO vs. China and Russia together. They can be beaten. The key with Russia is to turn the people against Putin. There are many in Russia who would like to be more like Poland or the Czech Republic, an ordinary European state, liberalizing and on its way towards Western levels of prosperity. Turning the Chinese people against the CCP is much harder, for many reasons. 

Anyways, the key thing now is for the West to have serious talks about the future. Tough questions have to be answered, and electorates need to be educated about a very nuanced, long term strategy. A future LIO that is more inclusive, and that is stripped down to the truly essential values needs to be articulated to as to be more attractive to states with different cultures and values. The LIO needs to think about how it can function with fairer burden and decision making sharing. It needs to articulate a possible future where any nation that competes fairly under LIO rules could one day surpass the USA and be encouraged to lead the order.

But arguably the Baltics were a step too far, too early. That is a tough discussion. But once the West started playing around in Ukraine and east of it, like with Georgia, that was too soon. 

It's not that, in the end, the end game isn't a liberalized Russia and post-Soviet sphere, where Russia is neither inclined to nor capable of bullying its neighbors for asymmetric gains. But this is a long, strategic game where resources are limited, nukes are plentiful, and one always has to keep China in mind. 

So it isn't about whether Russia was right, or in the right. But Russia is Russia, and it is whether the West played their cards in the best manner to get to their end goal in the least harmful way for everyone involved. I do not think they did. And now Georgia and Ukraine are playing the price for Western strategic recklessness. 

I get that the Georgians and Ukrainians are ostensibly adults as well, and have agency.

Ignoring the parentheses, I'm not aware of any international law that states that delivering arms makes one a co-combatant. There are plenty of conflicts where the US has provided arms to one side during the war without being a combatant. An immediate example that comes to mind is the Yom Kippur War in 1973, where the US airlifted arms to Israel for days after the initial attack without being considered a combatant.

In a matter of hours, the world order has turned drastically less favourable for the Western democracies.

Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Ukraine elevates Russia into a full-spectrum commodity superpower, adding critical market leverage over global grain supply to existing strategic depth in energy and metals.

We wake up to the sobering reality that Russia is too pivotal for the international trading system to punish in any meaningful way. It influences or determines everything from bread in the shops, to petrol for Europe’s homes and power plants, to supply chains for aerospace and car plants, or soon will do if Kyiv falls.

Who knew that almost 90 per cent of Europe’s imports of rapeseed oil comes from Ukraine, or Spain’s jamon iberico depends on grain feed from the black earth belt of the Ukrainian steppe? Ukraine turns Putin’s neo-Tsarist empire into the Saudi Arabia of food, controlling 30 per cent of global wheat exports and 20 per cent of corn exports.

It is not just Brent crude oil that has spiked violently, hitting an eight-year high of $US102. Aluminium smashed all records this morning. Chicago wheat futures have hit $US9.32 a bushel, the highest since the hunger riots before the Arab Spring.

The cardinal error was made in June 2015 when Germany went ahead with the bilateral pipeline just a year after the annexation of Crimea, signalling that the first anschluss of 21st century Europe would go unpunished, or worse, that it would be rewarded with a strategic prize. If you want to date the death of a sovereign democratic Ukraine, it was that merkantilist decision. Royal Dutch Shell was an abettor. Putin got our measure.

Russia is sitting on $US635 billion ($887 billion) of foreign exchange reserves. It has a national debt of 18 per cent of GDP, one of the lowest in the world. It has a fiscal surplus and does not rely heavily on foreign investors to finance the state. This renders US sanctions against new issuance of sovereign bonds a mere nuisance.

The Kremlin is enjoying a windfall gain from commodities. Benchmark gas futures contracts (TTF) for March have hit extreme levels of €120 MWh. Russia is earning $US700 million a day from sales of oil to Europe and to the US, which needs heavy Urals crude to replace sulphurous Venezuelan barrels for its refineries.

The harsh truth is that Europe would spiral into crisis within weeks if flows of Russian gas were cut off - by either side. The short-term loss of revenue for the Kremlin would be a small fraction of Russian gold, euro, and dollar reserves. There is no symmetry in this. Whatever the rhetoric, energy business as usual will proceed.

The US and Europe can and will enforce a technology blockade, restricting Russia’s access to advanced semiconductor chips, acting in tandem with Taiwan’s TSMC and Korea’s Samsung. This will hurt but it will take time. Russia has stockpiles. It has its own producers able to make mid-level chips down to 28 nanometres.

Now we face a reconstituted Russian empire in tooth claw, as far West as the Carpathians, with a stranglehold on the raw materials of our existence. None of this was inevitable. It is the result of systematic policy failure.

Europe has vetoed expulsion of Russia from the Swift nexus of global payments for fear of the systemic blowback into its own banks, and because it would have made it hard to pay for Putin’s oil, gas, metals and grains - leaving aside the risk that Russia might go all the way up the retaliation ladder.

So one watches the Western pantomime over sanctions with a jaundiced eye, knowing that almost everything being discussed is largely beside the point, and that only military strength matters when push comes to a 200,000-man military shove.

The errors that led to this lie in years of European disarmament, the result of both wishful thinking by a complacent elite and because of fiscal austerity imposed by EU commissars during the eurozone crisis, with no regard for the larger strategic picture.

It would have been easier and wiser to stiffen a democratic Ukraine while we could. Now we face a reconstituted Russian empire in tooth claw, as far West as the Carpathians, with a stranglehold on the raw materials of our existence. None of this was inevitable. It is the result of systematic policy failure.",,,,,,,,,1645753767,,,{},hybpgu4,False,t3_t0ri0y,False,True,t3_t0ri0y,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0ri0y/deleted_by_user/hybpgu4/,,1,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,,,0,[],,1645724967.0,[],text,t2_6majm5gd,False,False,[],1653640666.0,

For more accurate estimation, you probably need some other multipler metrics based on how people are organized.  An example would be assabiya - ability for collective action (a la Ibn Khaldun).  Another would be how efficiently a society identifies talented individuals among itself, and deploys them in position of authority and responsibilities.  I have not seen these kinds of analysis applied to the current geopolitical situation - only in historical contexts.

Clearly, if geographic/resource was the destiny, we would not have had nations like British Empire, Dutch Empire, Portugese Empire, Mongols Empire, etc., all of which overcame their geographic/resource limitations to defy their destiny and changed the world.  Rise of Europe in 18th and 19th century is another example which cannot be understood based on geography/resources alone.  Suffices to say that organization matters - but we don't know how to take this into account quantitatively.

If China, with its large population (4x larger and US), achieves similar assabiya and other organizational metrics as US, could it offset all its unfavorable geography/resources limitations?  I don't know.  It's hard to put confidence intervals on this, since we don't know how to quantify this (at least not yet).

Someone more well versed than I could probably give a better response.

So off the top of my head here some reasons

1. It seems like the Ukraine is currently opting for gorilla warfare strategies.

1A. Seems to be going okay as they are taking back assets and holding them for now

2. I'm not sure they have the numbers to strike their own offensive. Like you said. 

3. Vladimir Putin did recently threaten but did not say word for word but that any invasion attempt on Russia, that he would possibly nuke that country and that country would have the worst history it's ever seen.  This is significant if you consider that Russia has 45% of the world's nuclear arsenal.

That's just my small take on it there's probably a lot more to it though.",11c81acd1bdf00942537634079a2a1530e354fd9,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645747511,,0.0,{},hybb6fj,False,t3_t0p1yw,False,True,t3_t0p1yw,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0p1yw/why_is_ukraine_not_taking_the_fight_to_the_enemy/hybb6fj/,1645747530.0,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645718711.0,[],text,t2_3wd924ie,False,False,,,
