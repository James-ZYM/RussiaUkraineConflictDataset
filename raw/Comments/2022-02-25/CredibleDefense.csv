This is an extremely well-known vulnerability of the Russian state, and has long been advocated by opponents of Putin’s regime - for example, Bill Browder and Gary Kasparov - as the ultimate Achilles’ Heel to be used against the oligarchy/kleptocracy.

The Russian oligarchs control the wealth of Russia, which is considerable. However, that money is not kept in Russia. It is held in foreign banks, most in Europe and the United States.

The punchline here is that this goes back to the days when “Russia” was the Soviet Union, and communist ideology literally rejected the concept of money as an economic principle. But the USSR still had massive mineral exports to the Western democracies, so how did they manage that wealth? Well, they accepted foreign capital in exchange, but the wealth of the state was handled by the KGB. Specifically, it was handled by a group of spies that included a much younger Vladimir Putin. So when he USSR fell, and adopted democratic government and a capitalist economy, it was actually Putin and his cabal that held control of all of the state financial accounts. And those are the guys who became the Russian oligarchs were familiar with today.

Investment opportunities are extremely limited in Russia due to its geography and crumbling infrastructure, so the oligarchs have kept that money in Western banks for the last 30 years. And since the West controls those banks… yep, the US and Europe can basically decapitate the Russian economy whenever we want.

All we’d have to do is target the top 50 Russian oligarchs, and seize all of heir foreign assets. That’d probably bring this war to an end real quick.

The only question is whether western politicians have the political will to act on this threat. Oh… and also the question of what happens to an unstable Russian state, facing economic collapse and financial insolvency.

France didn't request a puppet state be carved out of German territory to insulate their 450 km border, despite being invaded twice by Germany twice in the first half of the 20th century, including being effectively conquered by Germany the second time.

It feels like this ""obvious"" national security need is less than obvious and more a reflection of a level of paranoia about NATO that belongs in 1950s ideological conflict, not in the 21st century.  It only seems justified if you have a military posture openly hostile to NATO member countries.

In the end, its either the threat of having to defend itself (with NATO backing) and suffer disruption to their economy and well-being vs a guarantee of protection against invasion. 

If you believe that Putin isn't trying to resurrect the USSR, believe that as long as you never think about joining NATO then you won't get attacked, then I assume they will stay neutral.

For others who don't trust Putin and his promises, then getting in NATO is worth considering.

I think another factor would be just how *quickly* NATO can actually get troops into their nation once an agreement to join NATO is signed - especially for small countries. Joining members should be ready for a Russian attack by the time they sign an agreement - at least as long as it takes for NATO reinforcements to arrive. The speed of which NATO reinforcements arrive will probably play a significant part of how Russia will respond.

From the perspective of an amateur civilian observer with not even 30 years of conscious life under the belt, I think in Ukraine's case, they and NATO dithered much too long for their own good. Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk should have been a clear enough message that Russia wasn't going to stop until Ukraine submitted to its terms. It seems that NATO, in their belief that Putin won't escalate if they de-escalate, made the wrong call of backing off. Ukraine made the same call literally right up until the night before the invasion that if they backed off, Putin would remain relatively mild.

This isn't necessarily blaming NATO, Ukraine or the west. Usually de-escalation and avoiding nuclear war are valid and responsible reasons to tread carefully. It's just that Russia fully grasped western reluctance and really tied western nations hand behind their backs by threatening nuclear war for responding to invasion. 

For the nations wanting to join NATO, when it comes to someone like Putin, opening the kimono too early is a bad idea. If you want to discuss joining NATO, you better keep it under wraps. If you open the kimono, you better be ready for the worst and act quickly. Dragging things out when they are out in the open will leave you at risk of having the same fate as Ukraine.

For western nations, particularly the U.S, I absolutely recognize the risk of nuclear Armageddon. Yet, there is time for caution and time for taking a hard line. While there is an increasingly thin razors edge when you start going toe to toe with another nuclear power, you can't let this become leverage that gets held over your head as another sovereign nation gets invaded - as I think is the case with Ukraine. 

There is probably much more nuance that would make my takes completely outlandish and implausible so I'm always ready to learn more and stand corrected if need be.",968e421569f8a12d203a317b101407208cb4fdf6,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645823071,,0.0,{},hyfiddd,False,t3_t163s1,False,True,t1_hyf99d3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t163s1/options_for_intervention_in_ukraine_that_do_not/hyfiddd/,1645823083.0,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645794271.0,,,

- NATO military spending is more than 10x Russian military spending. 

- NATO is something like 30 countries spanning 3 continents, 3 nuclear powers, and 7 of the top 10 highest GDPs. 

- NATOs combined population is 940 million vs Russias 150 million. 

- Russia and China COMBINED spend less than $300 billion on their military annually. The USA ALONE spends ~$750 billion. 

- NATO has 17 aircraft carriers. Russia has maybe 1 depending on its mood that day. They usually deploy it along with a tug because they aren’t confident in its ability to complete an extended journey under its own power. China has 2 that’s aren’t fully operational yet and are basically just retrofits of 40 year old Russian boats.

- NATO has almost 800 5th gen stealth fighters. Russia has 14. China has ~150.

- NATO has the 1st (USA) and 4th (Canada) largest oil producing countries.

NATO does tend to respond a bit less quickly due to the mechanics of democratic bureaucracy, but the numbers are so overwhelmingly in NATOs favor they could give any peer state a decent head start and still crush them with little drama. Just another day at the office. And fortress America is basically untouchable, so there is very little chance of war production being cut off.

Like I said nukes obviously change the equation, but it’s pointless to consider them because then just everyone dies and there are no winners.

Also Russia can’t bully China into shit because China could kick their ass too.

Suppose that, say, Poland were to decide on its own to get involved in the conflict, without the backing of NATO.  At that point, Russia would probably consider it fair game to counter-attack Poland's military bases.  How should NATO respond to this, were it to happen?  If we decide that this counts as an attack on NATO, then NATO would join the conflict, and that's WWIII.  If we decide that Poland is on its own because it attacked Russia by itself, then we would have established a dangerous precedent for it being okay for Russia to attack a NATO member without triggering a response from the reset of the alliance.  Both of these outcomes are really bad.

The only way that such an action would result in an outcome that wasn't really bad would be if Russia did not escalate the conflict to territory outside Ukraine, but I think that this is very unlikely because the amount of troops it would most likely take to actually make a difference would probably be enough to cause Russia to escalate.

Of course, this entire hypothetical is built on the assumption that Russia would consider an attack by Poland to be by Poland alone and not by all of NATO, and there is a very good chance that Russia wouldn't treat it this way.",2a278506e2e6a2ad7fd61793171aafe2b1d2c6fc,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645819212,,0.0,{},hyf8k3x,False,t3_t163s1,False,True,t3_t163s1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t163s1/options_for_intervention_in_ukraine_that_do_not/hyf8k3x/,1645819223.0,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645790412.0,,,

If Russia were to kill the democratically elected government of a country, will the world do anything about this? 

I know the US has voiced particular concern and suggested Zelenskyy move to Lviv due to proximity to Poland, which would presumably allow for a government in exile. However, Zelenksyy formed a video in Kyiv a few hours ago and said he would stay. Hard to know what the right thing to do is, but this move certainly keeps up morale for the Ukrainian people. I won't even call it the Ukrainian army anymore, since it is really all people on deck, though this is semantics. I think it is a respectful thing for a leader to stay with his people, especially when he is asking them to put their lies on the line, but he is really exposing himself to tremendous risk given: (1) US intelligence expects the city to be taken in days and (2) it is much better for Russia to quickly eliminate him and his government than to be drawn into long-term fighting.

1. Ukraine is on the Russian border, Afghanistan was half a world away.

2. Historically Ukraine has deep ties with Russia and was more part of the Russian empires than not. They are culturally similar, and many speak the same language. Assimilation is a real option.

3. Large Russian and pro Russian minorities in Ukraine. This means that the Russians can rely on Rus-Ukrainian minority to rule the country for them, such as the minority rule of the Alawite Assad of the Sunni majority Syria. With Russian support 

4. Public support. Through a combination of 1+2+3, the Russian public has a much greater support for the war than the US public had of Afghanistan's occupation. Further, the Russian public is more nationalistic than the western one. They perceive NATO as a real threat on their borders. All that means that going forwards the occupation of Ukraine will never grow as unpopular as Afghan.

5. Geography. Ukraine flat, Afghanistan is insurgent heaven. Ukraine is urbanized and westernized, while Afghan is tribal and rural. The former doesn't produce great insurgents.

6. Outside interference. Afghan had neighboring Pakistan and Iran, that the US for multiple reasons could do nothing against. Ukrainian insurgency won't have a foreign home base the border of which they could cross at will as it was with Pakistan.

Well, toppling the government is one option for Russia, but Putin has already put on the table that the government can remain in power if they agree to abandon pursuing NATO membership.

[],False,,SyrusDrake,,,[],,,,text,t2_ex408,False,False,"I am not an expert on politics or military or Eastern Europe or, in fact, anything, really. But I'm getting the impression that the ""West"" (in want of a better term) might have over-estimated Putin for the past years, for a variety of reasons and in a variety of ways. Some of those misjudgements could potentially explain the seemingly inexplicable operation in Ukraine. 

1. Putin has primarily been portrayed as cold, calculating, rational ex-KGB agent. For a shrewd, objective military and political mastermind, the apparent Russian plans for Ukraine wouldn't add up. But maybe he's just a delusional dictator after all?

2. Similarly, I have never heard anyone call Putin a dictator, but that's *de facto* what he is. As history has shown, it's not uncommon for dictators to surround themselves with yes-men. They don't want to hear inconvenient truths but only what confirms their already established views. Maybe there simply wasn't anyone left in Putin's inner circle to tell him that only sending 200'000 troops to occupy Ukraine was a bad idea and unrealistic. 

3. The general assumption is that Putin wants to achieve...something *in Ukraine*. But I think it's also possible that the real ""goal"" of the war lies in Russia. Authoritarian leaders have always made use of external threats and conflicts to try and secure their position and popularity. And if that's the case, maybe he doesn't *want* the war in Ukraine to be over quickly. If they just rolled right into Kyiv and ended the war before Sunday, even the most propaganda-infused Russian might have been like ""Hey, this seemed easy. Are we the bullies?"" But if the war drags on and it might even become apparent that Western supplies are used to kill Russian soldiers, he can make the war look like a justified defensive war against Ukraine as a NATO puppet. If Russia is strong and powerful, he might not be needed. But if Ukraine can actually threaten them, the Russians need him as a strong and powerful leader.

I was too young to actually remember it, but as far as I can tell, when Sadam invaded Kuwait, nobody was wondering what kind of amazing 4D chess he might be playing. The entire world was just like ""Yea, he's a desperate and unhinged despot. Of course he'd pull dumb shit like this.""  
But when Putin pulls something like this, nobody seems to even entertain the thought that he's an unhinged and desperate despot who cut himself off from rational advice and thus started a completely unsustainable military operation that can only end in disaster. Instead, everybody assumes he's some brilliant mastermind and the whole FUBAR is actually a brilliant ruse instead of just FUBAR. 

I don't know if any of this is in any way accurate. Remember, expert on nothing. But in science, if your data doesn't fit your hypothesis, there comes a point where you have to question your hypothesis.",17c3d0ced0822938423108a9539623bf93b51ca0,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645816321,,0.0,{},hyf15cw,False,t3_t0t4xj,False,True,t3_t0t4xj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t0t4xj/regarding_ukraine_something_i_cant_figure_out/hyf15cw/,1645816339.0,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645787521.0,,,

The national security should be obvious- Russia does not want a 2,000km border with NATO. Ukraine has been used to invade Russia before, and it's very hard to defend the entire thing. It's different from the Baltic states which are relatively tiny. 

As for the national pride bit... Ukraine was Russian territory for hundreds of years. It was a part of Russian Empire / USSR for longer than Texas has been a part of the US.

Now the West threatens to come in and take Ukraine from them. To allow this would be a total capitulation to the West. Russia considers itself a great power, so it must fight against that.

So after the 2014 Ukrainian regime change, they were put on a timer. The writing was on the wall that given the opportunity, Ukraine would join the West.

* The second parameter is Stateness, which is the ability of the executive department to carry out their policies. It consists of Autonomy, Capacity (resources to ensure compulsion, both economic and military), and Legitimacy. Higher Stateness means the leaders' decision to comply or not is more likely to happen.

Ok, so let's think about sovereign debt and when and how it matters. 

US sovereign debt is denominated in US dollars, so de-facto that's a claim on US dollars. The Federal Reserve can always print US dollars, hence they can always repay debt that is denominated in nominal terms (TIPS are a different matter). Obviously overprinting would lead to inflation and a devaluation of the dollar vis-a-vis other currency. But if really in needs, the US could turn into a quasi-autarky economy  for military needs, energy, food etc... I'm not saying this would be a desirable state, just saying that they might survive, proof being the fact that US had a very large public debt during WWII.

What about Russia? Same thing, their debt is denominated in Rubles. Everything applies, with the exception that:

\-the Russian economy is much more dependent on foreign import from US allies for tech goods.

\-most of the trade invoicing is done in dollars, so Russian trade is much more sensitive to changes in the value of the Ruble.

\-Russia depends much more on foreign exports (¨¨¨¨¨¨30% of GDP) than the US (10% of GDP). A falling Ruble is in theory very good for exports, but of course sanction in principle can block them. So not only Russia would suffer all the costs of a weak Ruble, but would get none of the benefits. If they let them export oil and gas this does not really goes through, but in principle it can happen.",01aca24cafacb54637ecfdd66a4c7960c26fdb07,True,False,,,,,0.0,1645799416,,0.0,{},hydtod9,False,t3_t0rmlg,False,True,t1_hydbyof,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t0rmlg/are_sanctions_against_russia_completely_toothless/hydtod9/,1645799431.0,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645770616.0,,,

Section III, Russia promising support over Taiwan:

&gt;	The sides reaffirm their strong mutual support for the protection of their core interests, state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose interference by external forces in their internal affairs.

&gt;The Russian side reaffirms its support for the One-China principle, confirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposes any forms of independence of Taiwan.

Then the PRC fiving some support over Ukraine:

&gt;	Russia and China stand against attempts by external forces to undermine security and stability in their common adjacent regions, intend to counter interference by outside forces in the internal affairs of sovereign countries under any pretext, oppose colour revolutions, and will increase cooperation in the aforementioned areas.

Later, more support over Ukraine:

&gt;	The sides believe that certain States, military and political alliances and coalitions seek to obtain, directly or indirectly, unilateral military advantages to the detriment of the security of others, including by employing unfair competition practices, intensify geopolitical rivalry, fuel antagonism and confrontation, and seriously undermine the international security order and global strategic stability. The sides oppose further enlargement of NATO and call on the North Atlantic Alliance to abandon its ideologized cold war approaches, to respect the sovereignty, security and interests of other countries, the diversity of their civilizational, cultural and historical backgrounds, and to exercise a fair and objective attitude towards the peaceful development of other States. 

And, in reference to the security demands that Russia sent the US and EU:

&gt;	The Chinese side is sympathetic to and supports the proposals put forward by the Russian Federation to create long-term legally binding security guarantees in Europe.

Then in section IV

&gt;	They reaffirm that the new inter-State relations between Russia and China are superior to political and military alliances of the Cold War era. Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no ”forbidden“ areas of cooperation, strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation is neither aimed against third countries nor affected by the changing international environment and circumstantial changes in third countries.

Some meta about the statement.

The narrative is that if we squeeze/seize these assets, Putin gets a level of internal pressure that can't be suppressed as easy as individual activists or street protests.

I think the limiting factor here is how exposed Western financial institutions are to these oligarch assets and the leverage almost certainly applied to these assets.

I'd say that this notion of *collapse* is more of an aspiration of sorts that many have rather than an acknowledgement that that is indeed the case.

Also, the dissatisfaction with the regime is very present and that becomes apparent when people start to trust you and open up to you. Geopolitically, yes, you are right, Iran is doing quite well. Hezbollah remains strong in Lebanon, Assad is not going anywhere in Syria and Iran's influence in Iraq has increased exponentially over the past few years. Domestically though, most people have it quite hard. Inflation is very high and the currency is worthless - fruit sellers down the streets will accept payment by card (and that is not because Iran is extremely advanced technologically, mind you). The youth lack opportunity and those who have worked all their lives barely have savings anymore.There is a reason why Iranian refugees drown trying to reach the UK.

My theory is that the plan was Russian Special Forces were to grab the Ukrainian government, force them to resign, some regular Russian army would come in to help disarm the old governments military and arm people they had in mind, new elections, victory.

Somebody that was following the buildup of regular Russian troops closely could better answer this part but I think their number was originally far smaller. I think it was to look like they were going to the separatist area or maybe slice some other small part of Ukraine. The smaller size of the force was to look less threatening to the West.

Only thing I'd change is the word ""hysteria"" because people latched on to that and ignored what I wrote. 

From what I've seen of Russian media I nailed it. What I wrote:

&gt; This means Russia is free to constantly issue propaganda and get worldwide attention and coverage, getting massive free domestic support, which props up Putin as a strong leader - the only one who can stand up to west.

Ever since the invasion started the Russian media has been deliriously happy and strongly praising Putin's tough stance, and his ability to stand up to the West. Russian blame for the war is anywhere from 48-60% on NATO from what I've seen:
&gt;In December 2021, a Levada Center poll found that 48% of Russians believed that the U.S. and NATO were responsible for the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, while 16% blamed Ukraine and just 4% blamed Russia.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis#Russia

So what I wrote was obviously true:
The propaganda worked. The strategy worked. Putin's PR plan worked.

Even now people are talking about ""WW3 is going to break out!"" - exactly the same mistake as before. Making it about themselves and hyping it up, totally ignoring Ukraines suffering, totally ignoring Russian strategy - hybrid warfare.

Already looks like the EU isn't going to push for a SWIFT ban - which is exactly the kind of ""soberly, with consideration, and with confidence"" response I wanted. People are fearmongering that it'll lead to financial collapse and not showing backbone.

[],,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"&gt; Any future war against a peer or near-peer enemy will contain some measure of urban combat. A broad base of historical, demographic, sociopolitical, and military analysis makes that fact abundantly clear. As a result, militaries must be required to conduct both urban offense and defense operations. Military theorists have long described the defense as the strongest form of war, and current doctrine agrees. There are many reasons why a military would need to go into the defense in a campaign—to create conditions for the offense and regain the initiative, to destroy the enemy outright, to retain decisive terrain, or simply to slow the advance of a numerically or technologically superior force. A well-plan and -constructed urban defense could determine the success or failure of achieving a strategic objective, and could influence the outcome of a war. 

The authors are subject matter experts who think and write about this topic full time. The article here is not very long, straight to the point, and well written. 

The article caught my eye as current events indicate that we may see urban warfare in a large modern city, with a modern military, very shortly.

European natural gas imports

Last update: 15 February 2022

by Georg Zachmann, Giovanni Sgaravatti, Ben McWilliams

This dataset will be updated regularly.

This dataset aggregates daily data on European natural gas import flows and storage levels. Acute interest has developed in these indicators in response to soaring energy prices which are largely due to a tight natural gas market. The behaviour of Gazprom in using (or not using) specific supply routes and storage facilities has been the focus of public attention.

We hope this dataset – which we will regularly update – provides some easily usable insight into the current status of European natural gas supply situation.

To get access to the data, please get in contact with ben.mcwilliams@bruegel.org.

Figure 1 shows weekly extra-EU imports of natural gas for 2021, compared with weekly minimum and maximum import values for the period 2015-2020. By selecting from the dropdown, the figure shows total imports but also imports exclusively from Russia, Norway, Algeria, and via liquefied natural gas (gas transported by ship from around the world)...""

[War in Ukraine Could Create Permanent Nuclear and Chemical Environmental Disasters](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgj3b/war-in-ukraine-could-create-permanent-nuclear-and-chemical-environmental-disasters)

A lot of Russian military strategy in the last few weeks has been about misdirection, so I wonder if occupying Chernobyl is in part an effort to redirect attention away from other operations. However there are a few features that make Chernobyl a strategic sound place to base some troops, at least for a little while. 

Chernobyl also happens to lie along [a very strategic road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chornobyl,+Kyiv+Oblast,+Ukraine/@51.2643326,29.0661954,7.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x472a8f00e898abcf:0x14bcceabdbfd5d2c!8m2!3d51.2763027!4d30.2218992?hl=en) route between Belarus and Kiev. If you wanted to move in ground forces from the North to attack Kiev it would be one of the more direct routes. The radiation risk also means very few people actually live nearby, so you don't have to worry as much about pacifying the local population. Also, the risk of damaging the sarcophagus means that Ukrainian forces are extremely unlikely to counterattack there. 

I suppose they could threaten to [blow the sarcophagus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus), though I really don't know what the point of that would be beyond scaring the residents of Kiev. Actually doing would radiate their own troops camped nearby far more than the residents of Kiev and the international reaction would be uniformly poor. Some might view such a move as akin to using a dirty bomb. Knowing that Russian forces were willing to sink to this level of barbarism would only make the Ukrainians fight that much harder. 

I still think the real risk with Chernobyl and the other nuclear power plants is an accidental breach.

[],,,azulalbum,,,[],,,,text,t2_2014w6cg,False,False,"I'm not sure I see the contradiction. Putin can want to purge Western influences while simultaneously wanting a restoration of an autarkic Russia in the territory of the former USSR. Indeed, reclaiming its neighbors would do both.

If you think from Putin's mindset and believe your neighbors are just an opportunity away from invading, then you can see why Putin is so anti-democracy. He considers democracy to be a threat to him not just because a Slavic democracy would undermine his rule at home, but also because it deteriorates the territory within his sphere of influence. The paramount importance of territory has roots in longstanding [Russian strategic culture](https://www.orfonline.org/research/russia-and-the-geo-of-its-geopolitics-52857/), which emphasizes the need for territory to sustain a defense in depth. History has hardly punished Russia for claiming land or carving out buffer states to attain more strategic depth. Just in the last century, the partition of Poland in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact leading up to World War II arguably bought Russia necessary time to mobilize; Stalin's insistence that Mongolia be carved out of China as a condition for his support seems prescient when one considers how the Sino-Soviet split emerged not soon afterwards.

Back when NATO was founded, NATO forces would have to fight through East Germany, Poland, Belarus, and likely Ukraine to reach Moscow. Now, it's only Belarus, and there the option of going through the Baltics instead as well. Putin thinks that this reduction in his sphere of influence is a result of democracy--an ""invasion"" of ""Russian"" territory from East Germany through to Poland. He's probably right, in a way. Remember that Russia considers its neighbors only nominally independent. Belarus and Kazakhstan are examples of what Russia expects from its neighbors: states that are essentially Russian vassals and not truly autonomous states. Their independence is a formality, you see--so Putin would put it. And so the expansion of both NATO and democracy is a threat.

All of this makes sense if you ignore all signs of European intentions and the autonomy of the eastern NATO members. If Europe was truly bent on taking Moscow, Russia would probably need to pull out the nukes. Obviously, that perception has no bearing in reality. And it is totally irrelevant that the people of East Germany, Poland, the Baltics, and Ukraine realized that it was more in their interests to align with the West, and enacted their will through democracy. Vassals have no will worth considering. So conversions to democracies are NATO invasions of Russia by other means, and attempts to convert Russia are aggression as well.

You can take a look at Cuba and Iran to see how sanctions can be ineffective via overkill--there's nowhere to escalate for them, we've already sanctioned them to the extent possible. Going to the hilt means there is nothing else that is worth holding back for until you move to armed force. So if we want to deter anything in the future, we have to hold something back. That being said, this time around seems like the US may actually go all the way and turn Russia into the next Iran. Only time will tell.

Sanctions also depend upon political will. Easy for us in the US to say that we won't interact with Russia, but that doesn't mean the heat goes off for us. It's a testament to the Biden administration's diplomacy that he's kept the EU together and even ahead of us on sanctions this time around.

Also, remember that the logic of deterrence relies on rational actors. Putin may not be entirely rational anymore. That's not to say he's gone senile, but his aggressive isolation during COVID is hardly going to have positive mental health outcomes, especially since he was paranoid to begin with.

&gt; There's still a great deal of debate on this in political science circles, but it's hard to say from historical evidence that
sanctions alone work.

&gt; Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot tried to do a database, [which you can find here](https://www.piie.com/summary-economic-sanctions-episodes-1914-2006).

&gt; The one that might look most promising on the table is in 1925 with League of Nations vs. Greece, where the League of Nations supposedly used economic sanctions to force Greece from withdrawing from Bulgaria (the so-called War of the Stray Dog) but unfortunately their table is in error here -- the tipping point was instead a show of naval force.

&gt;More typical for a success (and it does get a score of 16 on the table) is instead the Guatemala crisis of 1993. The President Serrano tried to suspend the constitution and dissolve the Congress and essentially make a totalitarian state. There was a great deal of protest, and this ended up getting combined with sanctions pressure (from both the US and Europe) to get business owners also concerned. The army also sided against the president. This was sufficient to cause Serrano to resign and flee. Notice this is essentially a case where popular sentiment was flowing one direction already and sanctions gave an extra push.

&gt;In the mixed-success category would be UNITA vs. MPLA conflict in Angola, tied in with the so-called ""blood diamonds"". There had long been a proxy war in Angola (funded by the US and USSR in the 80s) but in the 90s there was a return to conflict in '92, and the UN did sanctions with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173 and later 1295 specifically targeting ""blood diamonds"" which reportedly were financing the UNITA effort. This led to the Kimberley Process Certification scheme which did significant damage to UNITA's financing, and after a great amount of desertion there was a major military win of MPLA against UNITA in 1999 before they collapsed entirely. This was a civil war where the sanctions helped reduced the ability of one of the sides to operate militarily, and there is no doubt this helped lead to the later victory.

&gt;I won't go through every example, but the basic thread is that economic sanctions alone only work if there's some other factor that causes a change. You can also try

&gt;Pape, R. A. (1997). Why economic sanctions do not work. International security, 22(2), 90-136.

&gt;and the arrestingly-titled sequel

&gt;Pape, R. A. (1998). Why economic sanctions still do not work. International Security, 23(1), 66-77.

[],,,Skolloc753,,,[],,,,text,t2_12z7lv,False,True,"Sanctions are always two-sided swords and are not easy to balance as they always poke in both directions.

- If your country has something which is of no great important to your enemy, but your enemy absolutely needs that, or if the power / size  difference is so dramatic that the trade with this country only makes a few % of your own economy, but 80% of the other countries economy: you are good and can do whatever you want. 

- If your, lets say, energy mix is based on natural gas, and 50% comes from that another country or if the other country holds billions in shares from your country and has no issues of sacrificing their money in order to hurt you more: sanctions which hurt the enemy far more than counter-sanctions could hurt you, will get very complicated.

- Sanctions usually have long-term, not short-term effect, so while at first sanctions seem to be toothless they can subtly undermine a country's economic, technological or military power in the long run. But usually that is a rather boring case for Excel sheets and is often not reported in todays headline (with more explosives and more 5 second statements). As they only work long time it gives the country a certain time to adapt, which Russia did, at least superficially. Furthermore: sanctions do not hit only ""the power"",  but common people as well, and economic war is always a war of propaganda as well. Nothing is more easier to say than *""Do you like being poor? Well, the reasons for you being poor are the sanctions of the US/EU""*.

&gt; Does the West have any good options for really hurting Russia

There are economic nuclear bombs. They are the end of the line and from there the situation will probably escalate further in the physical world.

- Deny access to SWIFT. 

- Full scale embargo on basically everything. This will hurt the European countries less than Russia, but it will hurt them, especially during a fledging economy recovery after COVID19 and will further increase the chances of extremists parties, like the RN and the AfD (both being paid by the Kreml) to gain power.

- Reducing or removing diplomatic relationship,  and putting international pressure on everyone to do the same. Welcome back to the Cold War, just this time with the economic and military power house China being in an Alliance with Russia.

Sanctions are like poison. It make you ill and it can kill you perhaps sometimes in the far future. But it is not as visible than a knife cutting your throat. See Kuba, see Iran, see South Africa.

* Normalizing invading a neighboring country if they do something ""strategically unacceptable"", e.g. join an alliance, attempt to acquire nukes. 

Reasons China would be against the Russian invasion: 

* There isn't any actual, legitimate, just reason for Russia to invade Ukraine (my opinion), so it would be hard to support for PR reasons. 
* Politically, (Ukraine : Donetsk and Luhansk : Russia) are more analogous to (China : Taiwan : USA) in this situation, and China can't back a large foreign power militarily supporting separatists.

Those, however, aren't the elephant in the room. The real costs are dominated by the need to store waste fuel for inordinate amounts of time and the risk attached. Both generally are hidden societal costs in most countries using nuclear energy.

If you were to calculate the actual costs of running nuclear energy you'd have to internalise these. The first can be done by taking the eternal values of rent and associated costs of a suitable peace of land. To internalise the second one would have to calculate an insurance scheme. In fact, a study did this and showed that you would have to increase the (at the time) price of power by a factor of , if memory serves right, around 20 for this alone.

As such, running nuclear in Germany is simply not profitable, even if when disregarding the costs of building a new plant.  
This is not to say anything about other countries. Germany as a rule is densely populated everywhere.
