it has been suggested if he gets Mariupol, and then moves onto Odessa, then there is the Russian enclave in Moldova. Noise has been made that was his intention to take over that territory. That would engage NATO immediately.

He has moved troops in the past years up to the border of the Baltic states and then brought them back. Is he playing chicken?
