[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"I am ambivalent about this article.

Are wars - all wars - ""wars of revelation"" as the article puts it? That's like stating the obvious because the real military strength of an adversary is a complex interplay between the perceived ORBAT of the adversary and his force employment model.

The Russian-Ukrainian War has yielded the ""revelation"" that our estimates of the Russian military capabity was misguided. That may be true. The question, however, is which estimate? Was it our estimate of the Russian ORBAT? Was it our estimate of Russian forces.employmsnt models? Or, was it both? In a similar way, we don't need to look at the Korean Analogy. We can look at the performance of the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan (and at the same time look at the performance of the Soviet Armed Forces in Afghanistan). A closer look tells us at least two things: First, the US performance (which was closely observed and studied by, among others, the Chinese) in both the Iraq wars was deceptive. Why? Because unlike the opposition that the Russian forces are facing in Ukraine, the US forces did not have to contend with overt and covert military and intelligence assistance being extended to their adversaries. In other words, the US forces in Iraq waged a one sided battle. The real mettle of the US forces was ""revealed"" when it had to contend with the rash of insurgencies that followed the cessation of the ""formal"" war. That is the point at which the weakness of the US ORBAT and it's force employment models was revealed.

Then comes the question of alliances. It is true a strong alliance between like-minded partners (like the Western Alliance of NATO) can prove to be an effective deterrent. Equally, however, it can also be provocative and in that sense, it can also be considered to be one (but not the only) trigger for the initiation of (perceived) wars of aggression.

One can see this in the Russian/Ukranian example. In effect John Mearsheimer makes this argument, wherein he claims that NATO's expansion was one (but not the only) causal factor that triggered a violent Russian action. When seen from the Russian point of view (and that is admittedly difficult to do when one is ideologically predisposed against ones adversary AND when one is attempting to secure one's own strategic advantages and to justify one's actions related to the same), the expansion of NATO could very well be the ""crossing of a red line"" in terms of how it perceives what a strategic threat to it is. On a side note, this is likely one of the reasons why India is demurring on a hardened formalization of the Quad in the Indo-Pacific. They likely estimate that the formation of a Quad alliance would pose a tangible strategic threat to China and that would lead China to undertake actions that would be warlike.

So, yes, while Alliances have a value, one needs to be realistic about what that value is and how equitably distributed its benefits are. Further, one also needs to recognise that while an alliance between similarly placed countries is one thing, an alliance wherein one of the partners is the world's sole superpower is quite another. This is simply because the latter has a very different set of strategic priorities and one which it, understandably, presumes takes precedence over others.",193e04360a740b67f932fbf87b8ffd3a3d86a742,True,False,,,,,0,1650844142,,0,{},i62cljz,False,t3_uaw35f,False,True,t3_uaw35f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uaw35f/the_korea_analogy_is_the_war_in_ukraine_a_war_of/i62cljz/,1650844158,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650815342.0

Key Takeaways

Russian forces continued to pressure Ukrainian defenders in the Azovstal facility in Mariupol.

Ukrainian sources report that Russian troops are preparing to conduct renewed assaults on Azovstal that would likely prove costly—possibly to meet a Kremlin-imposed deadline to clear Mariupol—but ISW cannot independently confirm these reports.

Russian forces secured limited gains northwest of Severodonetsk but remain unlikely to be able to launch massed offensive operations.

Additional Russian forces are deploying to reinforce unsuccessful attacks on the Izyum front.

Ukrainian civilians in occupied Kharkiv Oblast are reportedly organizing volunteer movements to resist Russian occupation measures, similar to previously documented actions in southern Ukraine.",00aa2c768f4172aa6e5285c8fdb12c68d9f36200,True,False,,,,,0,1650842087,,0,{},i62879d,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t3_uat8yp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i62879d/,1650842101,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650813287.0

By road, it is about 870 kilometers from the Ukraine to the Kazakhstan border. The straight line distance between the Azov and Caspian Seas is considerably shorter.

But Moscow's hold over this strategic stretch of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe is considerably less secure if Ukraine is a free actor, and especially if Ukraine is within the EU and if China EU relations continue to develop independent of Russia. Putin has likely been thinking about this problem since before he decided to seize Crimea in 2014 and is likely still thinking about it as he attempts to bludgeon Ukraine into submission.

Indeed, the geoeconomics/geopolitics of all of this are not new. Kazakhstan and China have long voiced keen interest in this corridor to reach Europe. Already in 2009, China signed a letter of intent directly with Mongol Kalmykia, Europe's only Buddhist republic, to build the Eurasia Canal through this region's Kuma-Manych Depression to link the Azov and Caspian Seas.

Moscow has been in an ever weaker position to impose itself on these developments. Russia's current Volga-Don Canal, which opened in 1952, is already an antique. China is offering a 21st Century solution, with shorter distance, faster transit and greater capacity, and it has the wherewithal to do the job. To keep leverage over Europe and China, if not his own constituencies, I suspect Putin believes that he has no choice but to make Ukraine, or at least this eastern part of it, his vassal state.

The Eurasia Canal would bring wealth, influence and status to one of Russia's poorest republics, but building such a Canal -- four times the length of the Suez Canal -- is beyond Moscow's means. It is also of much less interest to Moscow if Russia does not control at least Crimea and the Sea of Azov, and preferably Ukraine's Black Sea littoral, its gas fields and lithium resources. And no less so if this new Silk Road both bypasses Russia's own heartland and creates competition for Russia's own resources in both Europe and Asia.

The Yom Kippur War and Iran-Iraq war are the last two major conflicts (besides Karabakh, which still has some FoW over it). But in both cases armor to KIA ratios we're at least x5 and could be closer to x10 or more.

[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,True,"I posted about this a week ago and again yesterday on another forum:

1. Equipment will be an issue: Russia still has huge logistics issues. Even since they pulled out from the North. Although better in the South, they are still having trouble supplying the men they already have in the field. You can't just hit the ""mobilize"" button and march your big army into Ukraine. They can't just shove a million men into an area where they are having trouble supporting 30K. You need food, shells, gas, clothes, showers, tents, sleeping bags, medicine, parts, tanks, IFVs, missiles, etc.. and you need trucks and trains to deliver it. You can't just throw meat at the problem or you'll have a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field. Russia is being caught with expired rations, stolen cars, 1950's medical equipment, guys rifles from the 1800's (a bit of an exaggeration, but not really), unencrypted radios, trees tied to trucks in improvised slat-armour, knock-off tires, non-functional ballistic vests, and Chinese knock-off motorcycles. Mobilization isn't going to fix the problem of being unable to equip and feed all those guys.

2. Usefulness of all those troops is suspect: If Russia's army in Ukraine suffers from a lack of equipment (and trained operators of that equipment), not manpower, it isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around. Usually it is better to have your manpower trained as spares for when you own guys get killed than to train/equip a whole bunch of dudes and shove them into a battlefield all at once. Russia doesn't need to ""mobilize"" to achieve that. They can just get recruits by promising more money and properly train spares to keep the war going. Mobilization isn't necessarily needed.

3. They might not be able to equip a large force due to bottlenecks in their military economy: While mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you need like I talked about in point #1. (and that is a more realistic thing that Russia needs) Serious analytical reports show that Russia is already trying to do that to the best of their ability. Unfortunately for Russia there are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion. Apparently they have also been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc..). They might be able to field an army armed with AK-74's, boots, and some Kevlar, but that's it. They're already having trouble equipping their current army with basics, trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. Also, Russia doesn't have a big economy. They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They might not have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip anything near what they need the next few months (by which time the war may already be decided.)

4. Timeliness is problematic: You also need to train all these people or all you'd end up with is a bunch of conscripts with (likely) poor morale, training, etc.. who are a hinderance rather than a benefit. That takes time (months) and the war might be over by then. Russia is also performing poorly because their army fucking sucks at war. If they're already having trouble training recruits to a minimum standard, how is attempting something far larger going to be an automatic improvement? You might just end up with 500K useless bodies at a huge cost. You need to scale your goals to something achievable and useful.

5. The economy might be as big a problem as soldiers at the front: If you mobilize people for war and take them away from their normal jobs, you fuck over your economy and possibly make things worse in the long-term financially. You need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war. Right now, Russia's central bank is preparing for a massive decline in the economy. Possibly millions of new unemployed, hundreds if not thousands of businesses in trouble, and dozens of banks at risk of default (which will wipe out everyone's savings or drive up inflation if the central bank tries to bail them out). Now is not the time to institute conscription unless you can figure out a way to do it without hurting yourself more than the enemy. It might be wiser to wait for the economic fallout to take place and then try to hire the unemployed to go to war.

6. It might not be worth the cost given the alternatives: Conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan). People don't like being used as cannon fodder. It might cause people to revolt, which is worse for Putin than losing the war. Legally, they can't send guys into an offensive war (or at least that's what has been reported). Putin himself has said they will not send conscripts. When reports did emerge about conscripts being caught in Ukraine he made a bunch of pronouncements and called for them to be immediately removed. He even made a big show about it. This seems like a sensitive issue politically. I know he doesn't want to lose, but conscription might end up with him both losing AND being removed from power. A bad peace deal is better than being dragged through the streets like Muammar Gaddafi. There are other options besides mobilization. You can send out a massive advertising campaign and offer incentives (Russia is already doing this). You can activate semi-trained reserves. (Russia is already trying to do this but there have been some reports of issues). Or you can try to hire mercenaries (Russia is doing this too but, again, problems.)

7. It might be pointless already: Only Russia knows for sure. As mentioned in other points about equipment, while Russia might have an immediate manpower problem now, the bigger issue is likely a materiel problem. Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate. Planes, Tanks, IFVs, Supply Trucks, UAVs, Artillery, SPGs. At some point, if Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose them, and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with old AK-74's getting mowed down by USA built Rocket Artillery. Mobilization doesn't solve the materiel problem.

8. There's also a sustainability/demographic issue as well: Losing 3 or 4-to-1 against Ukraine (which might be their current loss rate) is unsustainable even in a long-term war. A win like that is just as damaging as a bad negotiated settlement.",cb7bc7ed0000659fb883ccb94d034ab207ecbd34,True,False,,,,,0,1650840827,,0,{},i625gij,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i61y81e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i625gij/,1650840846,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650812027.0

&gt; Though it presents incredibly high risk, escalating the conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders in the near term is an option Putin could consider if his survival is at stake. A direct attack on NATO territory—perhaps through Lithuania to obtain a land corridor to the Kaliningrad exclave and cut off the Baltic States, should Russian forces find more success in Ukraine—is possible. The powerful Kaliningrad garrison, which includes nuclear-tipped Iskander-M and Kalibr systems, could assist. At sea, a desperate Russian Federation might attack and seize commercial shipping in international waters on the Black Sea and in the Baltic. Broadening the conflict to engage outside powers more directly might stop the flow of support and lethal aid to Ukraine, throw NATO into disarray, create openings for sanctions relief, and rally an increasingly disaffected Russian population. If tactical nuclear weapons are postured for use, or employed in desperation, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will become quite real. Such use is not likely, but cannot be ruled out.

This is an article where the author is tasked with thinking about all the ways strategic things could go wrong and escalate. This is not fear mongering, the author even states that it is not likely. But it is something that military leaders and strategic planners must consider as a possibility. 

It is their duty to consider all the possibilities and to take them into account when thinking about and planning for threats and security risks. Even if they have only a slim chance of happening. 

I am not willing to take anything the Atlantic Council says as gospel for sure, they have had disreputable funding sources. On this one though, the possibility of a Russian attack through the Suwalki gap is a real thing that military people must think about.

It just feels idiotic. Russian forces don't seem like they're going to be able to cut off all or even some of the Ukrainian forces in the JFO. In the process, they will totally exhaust themselves  for future offensive actions for months at the very least. That will give Ukraine time to finish calling up their reserves and reequip with western weaponry, after which they will significantly outnumber and possibly outgun Russian forces in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

1) First and foremost, ubiquitous arial surveillance, targeting, and drone warfare. I don't think ""control of the air"" as once imposed is still a valid strategy. The low-cost and small size of these air assets means that countering them is going to be nearly impossible. Everything from using miniature quadcopters to loiter munitions, you have to assume the enemy is going to be above you. Long-range SAMs, Anti-Air batteries, are all great for things like cruise missiles or reaper drones, but I don't think a solution to the smaller sized pieces has really been established yet.

2) Communication is going to be hard. We've been seeing this in the deaths of generals on both sides. Modern EW makes finding and targeting signal centers easier than ever.

Your point about a significant part of population with immigrant background being from European countries is correct, however this should be viewed in light of how absolutely massive immigration to eg.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; The Russian invasion of Ukraine is the most dangerous event to occur in Europe since the end of the Second World War. In its potential for enormous casualties, destruction on an epic scale, and escalation to unthinkable extremes, it demands the attention and considered action of NATO, the European Union, and the whole world. No one can see clearly exactly how the crisis will play out. This “strange voyage,” in Winston Churchill’s words, is a journey into the unknown, as all wars are. The best the West can do is prepare for the worst, keep its nerve, and employ all its resources when its vital interests and most cherished values are attacked. Things are very close to that stage now. At stake is an international order founded on something other than brute force, imperial ambition, and autocratic self-help. A Russian victory in Ukraine, even at great cost, places a vengeful Putin on Europe’s doorstep, his ambitions partially achieved but still unrealized. The next blow will fall on NATO’s eastern flank. Now is the time to ensure that never happens.",db55331648de2fd032ad4464e9300afe5c4f8fe8,True,False,,,,,0,1650835777,,0,{},i61u2im,True,t3_ub4lh6,False,True,t3_ub4lh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ub4lh6/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/i61u2im/,1650835792,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650806977.0

The first half of your comment is completely irrelevant because 100km of road still needs to be covered for the supplies to travel from their point of origin to the front. It doesn't matter if you cover that in a single journey or 10, it will still create a bottleneck if you can't physically move convoys along roads fast enough and that pressure grows proportionately to the distance you need to cover. Based on how the Russians have advanced and the evidence of logistics issues that the Russians are facing, this seems like a perfect explanation for why forward depots are unlikely to resolve issues of Russian supply in the way that you suggest (because the bottleneck is in moving supplies by road).

&gt; The issue with the 100 km limit theory is that predicates no forward bases, the last place Russian maneuver units can get supplies from during rapid maneuver war is where they built their last rail stop, after everyone moves supplies from their to the FLOT. But as soon as things stabilize a bit and the lines stabilize, positional warfare starts replacing maneuver warfare, and they have time to move supplies to stage instead of use. That changes were those circles your buddy put on a map are located, and it changes the sizes too.

It is literally, mathematically impossible for the size of those circles to change if they represent the peak logistic capacity of local transport networks. They aren't hard barriers and it's certainly possible for Russia to operate outside of those circles for a limited time or at reduced capacity but no matter how many supply depots you build the supplies still have to start at A and end at B. That would be exactly why the other commenter observed that Russians were able to advance outside of the 100km range but then those advances collapsed (because supplying units outside of that radius is unsustainable in the long term).

If given enough time to extensively supply a depot then you can stage an offensive from that depot, that is true - but your soldiers still need to be continuously supplied, new distance constraints now apply based around your supply depot and so long as you can only depend on that depot for supply then you can only sustain that operation for a limited time unless additional logistic resources are devoted to the offensive. Also, so long as your soldiers need to be supplied while not in combat (and the enemy is not completely passive) there are limits to how far you can push forward in increments with supply depots before they become untenable.

&amp;nbsp;

Depots have a necessary function in terms of logistics but they aren't a magic bullet which can solve every logistics problem. The 100km heuristic has proven accurate in practice and will likely remain so until there is an extended lull in combat to allow stockpiles to be properly developed.",a60bcdb0604ca034fd6c9f4569632bebdc931e1e,True,False,,,,,0,1650831032,,0,{},i61iv02,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i61cv8v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i61iv02/,1650831050,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650802232.0

Let's take a 152mm artillery shell. It's originally located in a military ammo supply point deep in Russia it gets moved to a forward depot created before the invasion, like Belgorod for example, which acts as the OSK operational area. Then it's get moved forward again to the CAA operational area likely right on the border where everyone was massing right before the invasions and the last secure rail lines. When the invasion kicked off for an maneuver unit to get that artillery round meant trucks driving all the way back beyond the border, which the Russians couldn't do well because they didn't have enough trucks. However as the Russians consolidated their advances they built FOBs at the division and brigade level that were forward of those, so the artillery round sits there waiting for trucking belonging to battalions, brigades and divisions to move that to the FLOT to give to an artillery unit. 

Transportation units at the OSK level work their zone, CAA work theirs, and division and brigade work theirs, and nobody needs to drive all the way back up Russia to get shit, nobody is making 100 km movements. 

The issue with the 100 km limit theory is that predicates no forward bases, the last place Russian maneuver units can get supplies from during rapid maneuver war is where they built their last rail stop, after everyone moves supplies from their to the FLOT. But as soon as things stabilize a bit and the lines stabilize, positional warfare starts replacing maneuver warfare, and they have time to move supplies to stage instead of use.

1.) In retrospect I think it is possible to look back at the 80s and seriously ponder whether stationing nuclear weapons far forward in Europe helped or hindered as far as avoiding nuclear war. I'm not blaming us for that really -- it's the Soviets who got the ball rolling -- but this ends up pretty binary. The more we feel reassured that we could decapitate them, the more desperate they become to prevent that. Not sure we really want to have too many Petrov-style incidents caused by a Russian combination of paranoia and bad tech.

On the NATO implications - not so sure. Something that's easy to miss is that the ""internal politics"" of the alliance are subject to the same sorts of red-lining, bluffing, salami-slicing, and posturing as the external politics vis-a-vis Russia.

2% isn't a magic number where conventional defense becomes possible that wasn't before. 2% is an arbitrary political figure designed to convince the Americans that everyone else is treating this seriously enough that America shouldn't walk away.

But that leads us straight back into the same sort of brinksmanship thinking. Surely the Americans wouldn't *really* walk away. And anyway, if they *say* they expect 2%, surely they'd accept 1.5%? And hey, now that they've accepted 1.5%, why not 1.3%? Look, Joe's getting away with 1.3%, I can probably get away with 1.1%!

In my view the true threat to NATO is a political one -- the U.S. walking away -- and I'm not sure meeting the 2% target will head that off. It might help, anyways.

One advantage of land-based nukes is that you can deploy them very close to the enemy's borders cheaply (as these things go) . The US used to have nukes in West Germany and currently does in Turkey. You could put some in Poland and maybe in a few years, in Ukraine.   That means very little time to respond for Russia. If Russia launches nukes, US nukes could land before the Russian ones do. Doing that from land-based nukes is cheaper, simpler,  less risky than having SSBNs rotate from deploying close to hostile shores. 

As for US-based land nukes, I guess they're already there and they don't cost that much so why not keep them around? If the US had to start from scratch it probably wouldn't put much emphasis on stationary launch sites.

Putin is not crafty. He is a bully who is unconstrained by the norms of diplomacy and democratic governance and he knows it. He's very good at pushing the advantages being a kleptocracy gives him, but he fails to see the drawbacks that come with his abrasive style and zero-sum decision making.

Bringing dogs to a meeting with Merkel is emblematic of Putin's failures as a leader: it was a memeable moment that caused embarrassment for Merkel and allowed Putin to beat his chest in the short run. But Russia was, for 14 years of Putin, very well served by increasing integration with Germany and the European economy. Putin, rather than embrace that proved success, decided to abandon that in favor of semi-theocratic, ravanchist  neo-imperialism. 

Putin is finding out the same lesson as Ghadaffi. The West is willing to tolerate dictstors that are useful to them, but direct confrontation with the West is inadvisable. NATO is not weak or decadent just because it is democratic.

One is a somewhat more difficult than routine logistical task, the other is a complex task that requires up-to-date intelligence, precision strike capabilities against a concealed and protected target far behind enemy air defenses.

We know that Slovakia has provided tanks and we now have evidence of them moving around in Donbas. This is considerable evidence for statement a to be truthful.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,[],,,,text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False,"&gt;The 100 km limit was never a real limit, that was an estimation made in one prewar article by someone with no logistics background. 

Yes, it was originally a prediction.... based on russian doctrine that this is the distance they were able to supply from a railhead.

However, NOW, its a prediction that appears to have been confirmed as correct by the reality as seen in 60 days of operations.

In all of those 60 days.... they only had 2 offensives that breached that limit..... and both of those offensives had to be pulled back within a week or two, likely because they were increasingly starved of supply.

&gt;You took that as gospel but it's not.

No, I didn't take it as gospel. The comment above is not 2 months old. I waited 2 months, and then went and looked at all of their advances to see how many they got beyond 100km and held. The number was 0. They only got 2 to go beyond that limit, even temporarily, and then had to pull them both back. Every other offensive that approached that limit (Kyivh Rhih, Mykolaiv, Izyium) stalled at that limit, if not got pushed back from there.

&gt;Which is they do then the supplies have to either come from supply depots at rail sites 

Because whilst russia has an unlimited ability to supply by rail, using rail logistics..... they have a very limited number of trucks that can do road logistics.... and this limited number appears, *as measured in practice over 60 days of offensives* to restrict them to approximately 100km from ""the infinite resource supply"" they can access at a railhead.

&gt;or FOBs where they were forward staged, which is the entire purpose of using FOBs and FARPs and every other type of forward supply staging, so they don't have to go further back.

But they haven't been ""forward staging"" supplies.... They took Izyuim (80km from a railhead) 4 weeks ago.... and have had to continue to supply those forces in combat ever since. There was no ""operational pause"" or ""ceasefire"".

If they had sat at Izyium for a month, without fighting, they could have used those trucks to build up something like ""2 weeks supply of fighting material at Izyium"" (only 2 weeks as some supplies like food would still need to be provided even with a full ceasefire) and they could use that as a backlog they could utilise to press on further.

But they've been there 4 weeks, and have continued to fight there for all of those four weeks, the trucks they could have used to build a stockpile were fully utilised keeping their front supplied for continued fighting 100km from the railhead. 

As seemingly supported by the fact they pushed the further 20km from Izyium (80km from Kupiansk) over a week ago, and appear to have (once again) stalled out at the 100km limit.",3094d9e9cc4216aa313fc57d23960a048a8bc393,True,False,,,,,0,1650816473,,0,{},i60jkup,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i60hrbd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i60jkup/,1650816485,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650787673.0

There has a been a lot of reading lately about existential wars and how they relate to defense and the use of nuclear weapons versus those on the periphery. For example how Russia is fighting a war of choice and Ukraine is fighting an existential war, where if it did have a nuclear deterrent, it would be a serious factor in the war. 

It interesting to take a look at the amount of defense spending and compare and contrast it to the security situation of different countries, and whether they face an existential threat. 

The article makes mention of the fact that the US spent fifteen percent of its GDP on defense during the Korean War. For the US to have spent 15 percent of its GDP on a non-existential war in Korea in the 1950s is surprising to me. 

There are several Nato members who have refused to be any close to their obligations of 2 percent for decades. And Taiwan who faces an existential threat in the form of Chinese conquest, only spends 2.1 percent. Less than ten percent over the minimum for Nato members, none of whom are under such an extremely aggressive threat of attack. 

I don't know the right or wrong answers, but it is interesting to see the numbers and compare the security situations.

Some quotes from the article, (some from the author and others from quotes in the article itself):

&gt; * Though the Cold War had begun several years before the North Korean invasion, American strategic planners considered military force a deterrent and saw the true field of battle as taking place in the realm of political and economic warfare. 

&gt; * The Korean Crisis, and especially Chinese intervention in October of 1950, changed the terms of the debate.

&gt; * Stalin and Kim badly misjudged U.S. resolve as well as the Truman administration’s desire to demonstrate to its new European allies its will to fight against Soviet or Soviet-inspired military aggression. Instead of a three-day march on Seoul, the invasion sparked a three-year war

&gt; * The war led to a manifold increase in defense spending as the U.S. defense budget surpassed 15 percent of GDP, 

&gt; * The Korean War changed the conversation… convincing policymakers… that the Soviet threat was immediate enough to warrant massive increases in defense expenditures.

&gt; * As many international-relations scholars argue, war generates information, particularly about relative military capabilities. It’s one thing to have big defense budgets and shiny equipment. It’s another to prevail on the battlefield.

&gt; * Consider that just weeks ago a lot of us thought that Russia had successfully modernized its forces. The current conflict suggests we overestimated Russian military capabilities.

&gt; * For Lissner, “wars of revelation” – Korea, and later Vietnam and the Gulf War – produce significant “adjustments” in U.S. grand strategy. Korea not only demonstrated (at least to policymakers) that the U.S. needed a stronger military, it also drove home both the value of alliances and the willingness of Communist countries to mount wars of aggression.",80305a91ab355473cc788ba16b2e87938afbc030,True,False,,,,,0,1650811460,,0,{},i607okz,True,t3_uaw35f,False,True,t3_uaw35f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uaw35f/the_korea_analogy_is_the_war_in_ukraine_a_war_of/i607okz/,1650811476,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650782660.0

Even attacking bridges with missiles seems to require a fair amount of terminal accuracy.

I don't think it's realistic to train everyone to the standard that they can repeatedly make hits at long range but even the ones who miss are going to be able to drastically cut the distance from the target at how far they do miss, which is still good suppression if it's only 1-3 meters away. So it comes down to finding targets, which means binos, spotting scopes, thermals, drones, mobile acoustic equipment, etc. 

Plus fire control needed to be emphasized. There was just way too much area to engage known, likely or suspected targets in a typical 15-20 degree personal sector in depth out to 600-800 meters, at long range sectors have to be very thin and precise, and that means leaders communicating sectors as soon as the TIC starts, breaking down teams to own certain areas or distinct terrain features. Storm laser range finders were in the supply system, TL and SL could have had them for lasing ranges to give to subordinates when they gave their fire commands. But we barely so fire commands despite it being doctrine.

[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,True,"I really don't think it is a big problem:

1.  Not all the new weapon systems have actually made it to the front yet.

2. Many (like Stinger, Javelin, Cal Gustav) were already in Ukrainian inventory and people were already trained on them.  You also don't need to train everyone, just the people using the devices.

3. Most of the early aide was things like Stingers, Starstreak, Panzerfausts, Milan, Carl Gustav's, Javelins, etc..  aren't particularly complicated devices to train people on.  They're mostly self contained and Ukraine already operated very similar devices with their RPG-7's, IGLA, and Stugna-p in their existing military training. It is a bit like shooting a rifle, if you've shot one, learning the next is much easier.

4. Some of the donating countries use the same devices (UK, Sweden, Canada, USA, etc..) so there was a lot of duplication in aide.

5. Ukraine has had two months to get people trained on the new systems.  Keep in mind, you might not need to train everyone on ALL the new system, just keep track of who gets what and keep sending the same equipment to the same units.  Many serve the same purpose.

6. A lot of the aide is in systems that don't need huge supply trains and dedicated interpersonal training.  These aren't huge Anti - Air systems that require coordination among a dozen people, multiple vehicles, and a huge supply train.  These are mostly man portable devices, intended for a single user most of the time, and already designed to be used by people with very little training (hours/days, not weeks/months)

When we get to more complicated systems we start seeing other techniques to keep management, supplies, and training easy:

7. With regard to things that need a huge supply chain, they're sending almost exclusively things that use the same ammunition (155MM) for all the SPGs and Artillery. Yes, parts for things like trucks and SPGs will be an issue going forward, but they have access to the vast NATO supply chain, a good communications system, and a mostly intact rail network to ship things. Slovakia has already volunteered to repair things for Ukraine as well.

8. Donators are sending aide to third party countries to replace existing stocks of Soviet equipment (T-72's, S-300's, MIGs, Soviet helicopters, RPG-7s, Igla's, etc..) that Ukraine already operates. The third party countries are then, in turn, sending the soviet stuff to Ukraine to ensure they get to keep using the stuff they already have.  A lot of the aide was already old soviet stock anyway, especially ammunition types.

9. The heavy equipment Ukraine is capturing from Russia is mostly compatible with what they're already using or is EXACTLY what they're already using.  Operating, repairing, and maintaining it should be pretty easy. 

10. Some of the aide we are seeing are, indeed, things like moderately armoured vehicles as well as captured Russian stock that Ukraine doesn't use. This could pose a problem for maintenance in the long term if the war drags on. That said, these aren't horrifically complicated machines. These are mostly just extra complicated trucks a heavy-duty mechanic should be able to repair/service and Ukraine should be able to access parts and cannibalize damaged vehicles to obtain most of the parts they need. 

Honestly, besides the truck maintenance, and some of the more complex artillery systems that hasn't made it to the front yet, I don't see a lot of issues.",f8e6efc47b913f514aee33386e833892cf8207c3,True,False,,,,,0,1650810751,,0,{},i6061f4,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i5zvvf3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i6061f4/,1650810768,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650781951.0

As far s I can see, this appears to be bearing out in practice throughout the conflict.... I am unaware of any position Ru forces have taken &gt;100km from a railhead, that they haven't had to retreat from within a few weeks. The only examples of positions further than that were the positions around Kyiv (both to NW and NE) and they retreated from both. This would seem to support the contention they can't reliably supply further than this even with the road logistic capabilities they had initially, which have surely been degraded since then.

Current ""long distance logistics"" record holder appears to be their lines south of Izyium and they're at the limit of 100km there (Izyium is 80km in actual road distance from Kupiansk, and they appear to be about 10-20km south of that). Izyium could become a railhead, but they don't appear to be using it as one as yet or (at least) that hasn't been reported (likely to heavy damage in the fighting there).

For a tweet discussion I did a map of ""100km radius as the crow flies from their furthest forward reliable railhead ru appears to currently have relatively undamaged"" and this seems to back this up.

As you can see on that map, this would also seem to indicate that without either.... 

a) Taking further forward railheads than they currently have or

b) Extending logistics further than they've been reliably able to so far

... they'd be unable to encircle the JFO/Donbas (although they may be able to encircle Sverodonetsk).

It seems to me this *must* dictate their possible avenues of advance in the north/south if intending to take the whole donbas ..... they would have to essentially ""follow the rail lines"" and take new railheads as they go.... either Izyium and south, Huliapole and North, or Donetsk/Luhansk and east.

By road, it is about 870 kilometers  from the Ukraine to the Kazakhstan border. The straight line distance between the Azov and Caspian Seas is considerably shorter.

But Moscow's  hold over this strategic stretch of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe is considerably less secure if Ukraine is a free actor, and especially if Ukraine is within the EU and if China EU relations continue to develop independent of Russia. Putin has likely been thinking about this problem since before he decided to seize Crimea in 2014 and is likely still thinking about it as he attempts to bludgeon Ukraine into submission.

Indeed, the geoeconomics/geopolitics of all of this are not new. Kazakhstan and China  have long voiced keen interest in this corridor to reach Europe. Already in 2009, China  signed a letter of intent directly with Mongol Kalmykia, Europe's only Buddhist republic, to build the Eurasia Canal through this region's Kuma-Manych Depression to link the Azov and Caspian Seas.

Moscow has been in an ever weaker position to impose itself on these developments.  Russia's current Volga-Don Canal, which opened in 1952, is already an antique. China is offering a 21st Century solution, with shorter distance, faster transit and greater capacity, and it has the wherewithal to do the job. To keep leverage over Europe and China, if not his own constituencies, I suspect Putin believes that he has no choice but to make Ukraine, or at least this eastern part of it, his vassal state.

The Eurasia Canal would bring wealth, influence and status to one of Russia's poorest republics, but building such a Canal -- four times the length of the Suez Canal -- is beyond Moscow's means. It is also of much less interest  to Moscow if Russia does not control at least Crimea and the Sea of Azov, and preferably Ukraine's Black Sea littoral, its gas fields and lithium resources. 
And no less so if this new Silk Road both bypasses Russia's own heartland and creates competition for Russia's own resources in both Europe and Asia.

In other words, no 7.62 or .50 BMG machine guns, Mk-19 grenade launchers, designated snipers with .50 BMG, autocannon-equipped vehicles, tanks, artillery fire support, or some kind of air support?

This seems to be the weird aspect of the battle rifle debate, as if US infantry are regularly and frequently sent out without any reinforcing fire support or access to it, along with no access to defilade or cover and in a geography where they are exposed at 600 yard.  Maybe this was somewhat true for urban foot patrols in Iraq or some kinds of foot patrols in Afghanistan, but these kinds of experiences seem kind of unusual and mostly limited to ""nation building"" enterprises which I suspect the military isn't going to be doing anytime soon unless they have a compliant and willing population (eg, some imaginary protective occupation of Ukraine).

I think there's some kind of reasonable argument for a squad of designated marksman carrying higher powered battle rifles, or maybe just equipping a platoon with 2-4 of them which can be carried/deployed if the circumstances warrant it.

But overall, it seems like the US military is so mechanized that they nearly always have multiple close by vehicles that can provide significant long(er) range fire support, if not very rapid access to air support, that re-tooling all the rifles to support a narrow, hypothetical set of engagements at line of site distances seldom seen except in select geographies doesn't make sense.

The expert on Russia’s armed forces says Vladimir Putin will struggle to achieve his goals

https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/rob-lee-on-why-attrition-will-be-a-critical-factor-in-the-battle-for-donbas/21808954

TWO MONTHS into the war in Ukraine, Russia is still struggling to achieve its goals. Its attempts to take or even surround Kyiv and Odessa have failed. Now it is refocusing its efforts on encircling Ukrainian forces around the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. But mounting attrition is threatening its ability to achieve even this secondary aim. As the war enters its next stage, who has the upper hand?

One of the surprising aspects of this war has been the extent to which Russia’s strategy exacerbated the weaknesses of its armed forces while failing to maximise their strengths. Russia chose to pursue too many objectives from too many axes of advance. That worsened its logistics problems and meant that Russia could not mass sufficient combat power to achieve many of its initial objectives, including the encirclement of the Ukrainian capital. Had Russia chosen to focus its efforts on Ukrainian forces in Donbas at the outset, the war could well have gone differently.

Russia’s new focus on south-eastern Ukraine ought to play to its strengths and ameliorate some of these problems. The terrain in Donbas, with fewer large urban areas, is better suited to an offensive, allowing Russia’s army to make better use of its advantages in armour and artillery. Its reported decision to appoint Alexander Dvornikov, an army general, as the overall commander of the operation should improve co-ordination and fix problems with unity of command. The likely impending seizure of Mariupol will also free up additional forces.

But is it all too late for Russia? Ultimately, that will depend on which side is more affected by attrition. Relatively little is known about the scale of Ukrainian losses. What is clear is that Russia has lost a large amount of equipment, including helicopters and tanks. Of the six battalions in the Russian 4th Tank Division’s two tank regiments, two battalions’ worth of T-80U tanks have been destroyed or captured (more than 62 in total).

Russian personnel losses are an even greater problem. A NATO official put the figure as high as 40,000 killed, wounded and captured a month ago. Russia’s initial invasion force of approximately 125 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) added up to fewer than 100,000 troops in total. Importantly, not all of those were combat forces. That figure includes those responsible for air defence, electronic warfare and other support functions.

Compared with the armies of many NATO members, Russian ground forces have a higher ratio of artillery and other supporting arms to what are known as manoeuvre units, such as tank and motorised rifle units. Manoeuvre units, as well as elite spetsnaz (special forces) and airborne forces, will be vital to a new offensive in Donbas. But these are precisely the ones which have borne the brunt of Russian casualties. Russia’s lack of light infantry has been a clear weakness, and there are indications that many Russian BTGs invaded Ukraine at only partial strength.

Now there is little left in reserve. Russia committed 75% of its permanent-readiness BTGs—those staffed with professional soldiers and officers—to the invasion. That already stretched its forces thinly, with a sizeable share of units deployed from all five of its military districts, as well as national guard troops and even conscripts.

That Russia has chosen to send more units, possibly more than ten BTGs, since the war began from critical garrisons such as Kaliningrad, Tajikistan and the breakaway region of South Ossetia in Georgia underscores the extent of its problems. The Russian military is already ill prepared to handle another crisis—like the unrest in Kazakhstan in January—as long as the majority of its permanent-readiness ground units and rapid reaction forces are committed to Ukraine. Unless it mobilises conscripts—which would possibly require reframing the “special military operation” as a war—Russia will struggle to generate additional ground forces.

What does this mean for the forthcoming battles in Donbas? An attacking force typically seeks a three-to-one numerical advantage over the defender, if not more. That degree of superiority is now probably beyond Russia, except at the tactical level in some locations. It will probably try to compensate for this lack of manpower in manoeuvre units with air strikes and artillery. Russia may also rely more heavily on less well-trained militia forces from Donetsk and Luhansk. But this isn’t a recipe for a rapid breakthrough, and the Ukrainian military has demonstrated it is capable, creative and well led. More likely, any Russian advances will be slow and costly.

Russia faces other problems, too. Its objectives are obvious, robbing it of the element of surprise. That means Ukraine has the opportunity to disrupt those plans, and can seize the initiative. That could include disrupting Russian supply lines, possibly by destroying bridges and roads and forcing Russian units to drive through muddy fields, or attacks and raids on the flanks of Russian forces around Kherson and Kharkiv—or even additional raids in Russian territory, such as the helicopter strike on the oil depot in Belgorod on April 1st. Kyiv has an incentive to prevent Russia from dictating the terms of the war by allowing it to become focused in the Donbas region.

Ukraine’s advantage is that it enjoys what are called interior lines, allowing it to move forces and supplies over its own territory more quickly than Russia can. It has also mobilised its territorial defence units, which have now gained combat experience. Russia, meanwhile, having failed to degrade Ukraine’s air defences or eliminate its air force, is still struggling to interdict Ukrainian reinforcements and supplies—a task that was crucial to Azerbaijan’s successful ground offensive in its war in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. Indeed, the threat posed by Ukrainian air defences is limiting the effectiveness of Russian air strikes in the Donbas region, by forcing Russian helicopters to fire their rockets at longer ranges with less accuracy.

As long as Ukraine can prevent Russia from encircling a large share of its forces, Russian tactical or operational successes will probably fail to add up to strategic gains. Ukraine can afford to trade space for time, pulling back to more defensible terrain, or even cities, if necessary. If Ukraine loses territory but can nevertheless inflict greater losses on Russia than it sustains,this could be considered a success. Russia, after all, needs sufficient forces not only to conduct an offensive, but also to hold ground and rotate units off the frontlines for recovery. Continued attrition could make this unsustainable.

As long as the war continues, there will be some domestic support for it in Russia. But once it eventually ends, Russian citizens will weigh its costs and benefits, and many will question whether expanding Russian control over south-eastern Ukraine was worth the heavy military losses and international isolation. The approval ratings of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, will suffer. Therefore as long as Mr Putin believes his armed forces have a chance of advancing, thus improving Russia’s hand in diplomatic negotiations, he has an incentive to continue this war. However, the extent of the Russian ground forces’ manpower problems coupled with high attrition suggests Russia’s offensive in the Donbas is likely to achieve only partial success.",5009149643ecc235fa47c97f81cbb7946d7365cf,True,False,,,,,0,1650805195,,0,{},i5zup9f,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t3_uat8yp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i5zup9f/,1650805211,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650776395.0

--------------

When Russian troops first streamed across the Belarusian border into Ukraine for what they had assumed would be a lightning assault on Kyiv, they were intending to rely on the region’s extensive rail network for supplies and reinforcements.

The Russians hadn’t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus.

Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.

The attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia’s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia’s plans, analysts say.

But the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.

Alexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine’s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. “They are brave and honest people who have helped us,” he said.

The attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.

How much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.

“Given the Russian reliance on trains, I’m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,” she said. “They couldn’t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.”

The attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.

“I can’t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,” he said.

The saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.

Eight decades later, it is Russia’s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.

This second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.

“We didn’t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,” he said.

He and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.

Three main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.

Railway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.

“Our movement is not centralized,” he said. “It’s not like there’s a leader of the resistance. It’s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.”

The third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.

The Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway’s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network’s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group, which is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.

Starting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.

By Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.

The Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.

Dozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.

In early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.

The shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. “It has become too dangerous to do attacks,” he said.

But by the time of the police shooting, Russia’s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.

“We believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn’t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,” said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. “Thousands of Russian troops didn’t receive food, they didn’t receive fuel, and they didn’t receive equipment on time.”

Now, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can’t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. “There are open borders between Belarus and Russia,” he said.",5df690057f7f3911f908f626005180226cbbc55f,True,False,,,,,0,1650803057,,0,{},i5zr2cx,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t3_uat8yp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i5zr2cx/,1650803075,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650774257.0

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"Even though it has been partially demined, the DMZ still has a minefield. Because of the decades-old minefield, it has developed a dense forest. It also happens to be very hilly terrain which was part of how it became the border in the first place. There are also lines of defenses along both sides of the DMZ, and these would likely be fully manned in any situation where NK is actually preparing to destroy Seoul.

You could handle the vegetation by blasting several corridors clear with artillery. You could handle their lines of defense by heavily shelling their positions and then switching the artillery to smoke shells to provide a screen ahead of your advancing vehicles. You could handle the mines by leading with demining plows towing trailers with ~40x M58 mine clearing line charges to clear the mines as much as possible before the plows reach them. That could get you several safe corridors which tanks could finally advance through, assuming the demining plows and tanks could handle the slopes.

Of course, tanks need infantry support, so you'll need some AFVs which can safely get your infantry across the minefield and up/down the slopes as well. You would also need AVLBs to allow your vehicles get across the canals and brooks near the border. You'll need trucks with fuel, ammo, and repair/maintenance supplies to keep your forces moving, and medical support vehicles as well. You'll need this readied force to be large enough to fight the NK Army, so at least 1-2 thousand tanks seems like the bare minimum. (You do *not* want to clear paths through the minefield only to have the NK army rout your forces and use the paths you cleared as corridors for invasion.)

However, to do all of that at a moment's notice, all of these vehicles and readied crews need to stay in position near the border 24/7, at least during periods where high readiness is required. This means you need to build several new FOBs near the DMZ so that troops who are on duty for months at a time have basic facilities like a barracks, cafeteria, and bathrooms, and so there's some basic level of security around all of the vehicles and equipment.

These FOBs would become obvious targets for NK artillery, and because of how close they have to be, they might get little to no warning when the shooting starts. This is certainly an advantage in drawing fire away from civilians, but problematic in that having a lot of vehicles damaged or destroyed due to an initial wave of shelling may leave them combat ineffective. Loss of some vehicles (like demining plows) could delay any progress across the DMZ until additional vehicles can be sent, and this might be hindered by traffic jams resulting from evacuation.

Another interesting morsel was the speculation that an amphibious assault on Odessa was foiled by something so mundane as Lukashenka's map meme antics.

&gt;So what we tried to do was to take account of your concerns expressed to me and others, and we did it in the following ways: by our joint declaration on non-aggression; in our invitation to you to come to NATO; in our agreement to open NATO to regular diplomatic contact with your government and those of the Eastern European countries; and our offer on assurances on the future size of the armed forces of a united Germany – an issue I know you discussed with Helmut Kohl. We also fundamentally changed our military approach on conventional and nuclear forces. We conveyed the idea of an expanded, stronger CSCE with new institutions in which the USSR can share and be part of the new Europe.

Gorbachev responded, which is ironic

&gt;Let me also say some words on the Kohl visit. We managed to bring our points of view closer together. And, in fact, the results take into consideration our common interests--of Germany, yours and ours. I believe that without the meeting in Washington and at Camp David, without the results of the NATO Summit and the London Declaration, without the major work in my conversation with Kohl and your talks with Kohl, without the activities of our
foreign economic agencies, without this real political action it would have been difficult to arrive at the proximity in our points of view. We achieved all this because we understood each other's position. We tried to take into account each other's views. I consider the results of my conversation with Kohl to be
quite positive. 

Because they were on two very different understanding of these points. 

Now it is fair to point out that Bush was soft on this promise. His State Dept and Defense Dept have two different views, the State believed incorporating Warsaw Pact States into NATO would be detrimental to the US-Soviet relationship, while Defense believed, well basically, fuck them.

&gt;And again I simply do not agree - the the people who said Russia may attack again were correct - Russia proved them right by attacking. The prescription - NATO expansion - is also correct as Russia had only attacked countries not yet in NATO.

This is absurd in its simplicity. Those who said Russia will attack 30 yrs ago probably made a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

&gt;The other thing to note, as I don't think most Russians have realized it yet, is this war has created some threats for them that did not exist before. The neighors will not prioritize having a deterrent. Whatever you say and they say now, I think, the ones who can will eventually obtain a deterrent/guarantee against russian attack when before they could have been persuaded to not have such capabilities.

Like what, nuclear-capable Finland? Russia is getting squeezed one way or another. If Russia does not act, then Ukraine would be in NATO with their constitution stating it so, with thousands of km of border with NATO. If Russia acts, then there is a chance of that instability, something may be better. For one, Ukraine not in NATO. It is unfortunate that diplomacy failed, though one wonders if diplomacy was given a chance.

Is Russia wrong to invade a sovereign independent state? Yes. But there is a long history of why it happened. And its faults are not Russians alone. Russia has to bear most of them as it is their actions that began the war, but let's not pretend everyone else is planting a nice flower garden right in front of the Russian gate and Russia was like no man you aren't gonna plant that flower garden in front of my home. Russia stop a NATO expansion into Ukraine the only way they could, after NATO and the US declined to take them up on their demand of a written promise that Ukraine would not be accepted into NATO.",b5ba1f5ffa247e12c9142a7607dd0de69c1ade65,True,False,,,,,0,1650781631,,0,{},i5yzts2,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5yx21z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5yzts2/,1650781648,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650752831.0

Europe's longest highway, the 8000-km E40, runs from Calais across the Pontic Steppe through Kazakhstan almost to China.

As recently as January of this year, just before Putin's trip to Beijing, China's Pesident Xi Jinping raised the importance of this corridor in a note to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, stressing the importance of the development of the China-Ukraine strategic partnership to China's new ""Silk Road"" to Europe.

Such a corridor threatens to compete with the current main China-Europe road and rail corridor through Russia. More generally, conrolling Ukraine, or at least the Black Sea region of Ukraine, forestalls development of China-European economic relations through this corridor outside of Russia's control.

Currently Ukraine is on Wave 2 of mobilization, which is expected to conclude by May 24th, but may last longer if needed. I assume they are also putting a lot of effort into mobilizing foreign volunteers, but very little info on that for obvious reasons. 

There are a total of 4 waves:

Wave 1:
- Operational reservists 
- Ex-military
- JFO/ATO Veterans

Wave 2:
- Reservists which didn't make it to Wave 1
- Those who did military service or served under contract before 2014

- Reserve officers
- Conscripts

- Everyone else that fits age and health requirements

With the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine lost 70 percent of its naval capabilities. Moscow has also unlawfully seized eight maritime gas fields belonging to Ukraine: the North-Bulganakske, East-Kazantipske and Strylkove (subsequently returned under Ukrainian control) gas fields in the Sea of Azov; and the Odeske, Holitsynske, Archangelske, Shtormove and Bezimyane gas fields in the Black Sea (RIA.ru, December 29, 2015, Radio Svoboda, September 12, 2017).
Svetlana Nezhnova, head of the Ukrainian state-owned company ""Chornomornaftogaz,"" notes that a total of 7.2 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas has been illegally extracted by Russia from Ukrainian maritime gas fields in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov since the annexation of Crimea (Oilreview.kiev.ua, February, 14). This volume amounts to $1.728 billion in Ukrainian consumer prices in 2017. Russia extracted the largest quantities of gas from the Odeske gas field, located near the Odessa port hub, beyond the continental shelf of occupied Crimea (Ukrinform.ua, April 28, 2014). In 2016, Russia started illegal drilling in the Holitsynske gas field, which has gas reserves of up to 100 billion cubic meters; and in April 2017, a new gas platform was put into operation at the Odeske gas field (Neftegaz.ru, October 28, 2015, Neftegaz.ru, January 22).
The northwestern part of the Black Sea has estimated reserves of 495.7 bcm of natural gas and 50.4 million tons of oil and condensate. The Prykerchenska zone holds about 321.2 bcm of gas and 126.8 million tons of oil and condensate; and the continental slope has an estimated 766.6 bcm of gas and 232.6 million tons of oil and condensate (RIA.ru, April 13, 2014). The estimated price of natural gas extracted from the continental shelf is about $50 per thousand cubic meters (Neftegaz.ru, May 15, 2014). The success rate of geological exploration in the Ukrainian continental shelf reaches 0.5-0.6, while the average world index is 0.3 (Informat.com.ua, July 20, 2017). Consequently, Ukraine's sea reserves could serve to substantially increase domestic gas production. Kyiv is considering this opportunity as Gazprom is building pipelines to Europe that bypass Ukraine (Finance.ua, June 21, 2017). First, however, Ukraine's sovereign rights in its littoral waters and its freedom of navigation need to be reliably protected against Russian maritime expansion.

- ""In March to April of this year alone, the leadership of Western countries regularly made provocative statements about the possibility of Russia using weapons of mass destruction,"" Kirillov told the Russian-based state news outlet TASS.
- The U.S. military can carry out one of three separate scenarios in response to Russia's show of force, the Russian leader alleged. Of these, Russian leaders assume the “provocations” will most likely occur in Kharkiv, Kyiv, or Zaporizhzhia.
- The Kremlin also claimed Ukrainian officials were planning to launch a missile attack on their own navy base and blame Russia for the attack, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Through this purported false flag attack, the Ukrainian military would also stage a chemical attack on civilian infrastructure in Odesa, Russian officials said.
- Law enforcement officials were seen distributing personal protective equipment to Ukrainian troops in the Odesa region to prepare for the attack, Russian media alleged.

That seems like a dangerous escalation of rhetoric, especially since the allegations are so specific. It seems nonsensical to me that Russia would try another false flag operation so soon and so overtly after the disaster in Mali but I suppose I'm not the demographic that these shows are designed for.

All sorts of sacrifices have to be made that can drastically affect Russians, and inconvenience them, far more than they already have. 

Such as conscription. One of the problems historically with the Soviet and then Russian system was it was not popular, and it was unfair since the wealthy and powerful could always find ways to get out of it while the poor and disfranchised couldn't. The unpopularity caused them to reform their system greatly, shorten it to only 12 months, make it kindler and gentler, etc, and even now it still only catches the lower classes. To make mobilization work, they need everyone from every part of society because they wouldn't be conscripting just privates to do 12 months in a support job (like how its supposed to be now), they'd have to extend it back to 24 months at a minimum (if not make it for the duration of the war), but they need a wide range of recruits to include highly skilled technical workers, intelligencia, upper class to serve as officers, etc.

For a war where from 2005-2014 the US knew our troops were going to get into long range engagements in RC-E or RC-S we did shit to prepare the average grunt for it besides some minor weapon or optic acquisitions that were never exploited properly. I've never heard of a legit ""React to long range harassing fire ambush"" team, squad and platoon drills that were independently created let alone standardized as part of the METL for the trainup. Fire teams and squads weren't broken down into shooter and spotter teams, with an emphasis on finding the enemy to report their position and begin engaging with accurate fires (as a sniper team would do it) and not just blasting away at nothing at max effective range. 

Designated marksman training is only two weeks long and is a joke for the most part, the reality is there is no reason every single infantryman shouldn't have gotten that training before going to Afghanistan. Sure, only some would finish capable of making repeatable hits at extended but even those who couldn't reliably make hits could still accurately suppress within 1-2 meters. More so, everyone could have learned the art of scanning, which is taught in sniper school curriculums (though not DM training, weird). Its not not overly complicated to teach nor resource intensive, nor requiring that much in the way of brain power, it just takes about 1-2 hours to run a standard lane, one of those done a few times per week for a month before the deployment and that trains the brain how to look for targets. 

Instead, we issued out a plethora of weapons capable of long range, optics that were often capable of even further ranges, but half assed it in terms of training them how to use it all to even half of the capabilities, then bitched when they weren't effective.

Introduction and Summary:

&gt; Research paper published in the Journal of Aeronautical History by Prof Michael Weaver on An Examination of the F-8 Crusader through Archival Sources.

&gt; This article uses recently released U.S. Navy documents and also correspondence with pilots and maintainers to add to existing biographies of the Vought F-8 Crusader in service with the U.S. Navy in Vietnam. It examines the common claim that the F-8 was ‘the last of the gunfighters’ and shows that as per Navy tactical doctrine its pilots actually used AIM-9 Sidewinders as their primary weapon. The capability of the F-8’s avionic equipment is examined, and it is shown that the stresses of carrier operations degraded their reliability. The aircraft required ground control intercept support to achieve a kill. Information on effective tactics for interceptions is provided, showing the value of the ‘loose deuce’ pair of aircraft operating together. Finally, a comparison is made between the F-8 and the F-4 which replaced the F-8 in U.S. Navy service progressively up to 1976.

A few selected quotes:

&gt; * F-8s achieved fourteen kills against MiG-17s and shot down four Mig-21s during the Vietnam War, while Mig-17s shot down only three crusaders, a ratio which has fueled interest in its capabilities as an air to air fighter ever since.

&gt; * One of the common claims about the F-8 series was that it was ‘the last of the gunfighters,’ the last purpose-designed American fighter with guns for destroying other aircraft. This branding has been overplayed. In actuality, missiles were the F-8’s primary weapons, its guns were ‘secondary’.

&gt; * In 1966, for instance, F-8s suffered an accident rate of 3.26 per 10,000 flying hours. Only theA-4E Skyhawk approached that rate, and the rate for the F-4 was only 2.72.

&gt; * The Crusader’s best attribute was that it was maneuverable enough and powerful enough for its pilot to fly into a good firing position for its AIM-9D Sidewinders with confidence.

&gt; * The Phantom aviators had little trouble with the Starfighter and Thunderchief, but they “heard the chuckles of the Crusader pilots in the office…” To everyone’s surprise, the Phantom was a better air superiority fighter than the Crusader, if employed correctly. Over the course of 125 missions F-4B aviators learned how to fully utilize the Phantom. Over the course of 125 missions F-4B aviators learned how to fully utilize the Phantom. During the first three sorties, and F-4B crew would struggle somewhat against the Crusader, hold its own on the next three, and “By the time the had had six mission in the F-4, the were calling the tune against the aggressive, experienced F-8 pilots.” The reason for this was the combination of decent F-4 maneuverability and greater power. The aviators learned to keep the F-4 fast and most importantly, use all the dimensions, especially the vertical plane, to defeat a first rate adversary, the F-8 and its pilot.",15897e656b833e5293fd15faf1ded8e4ba63f327,True,False,,,,,0,1650760201,,0,{},i5xxn21,True,t3_uaihv3,False,True,t3_uaihv3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uaihv3/an_examination_of_the_f8_crusader_through/i5xxn21/,1650760213,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650731401.0
