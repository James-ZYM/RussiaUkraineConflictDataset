Why Russia keeps losing so many armored vehicles in Ukraine: ""It's finders keepers for these farmers""

April 23, 2022 / 12:56 PM
 cbs-mornings-saturday
As Ukraine attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, including some who remain trapped inside a steel plant, Russian forces have claimed victory in the city.  But Russia's recent defeats in and around Kyiv expose unresolved weaknesses, starting with Russia's armored vehicles. 

To date, Ukraine says Russia has lost close to 3,000 armored vehicles — but only half in combat. 

""It's not good military leadership if you are losing so many men and so much equipment,"" Ukrainian military expert Yuri Zbanatski told CBS News' Chris Livesay. 

 In the city of Bucha, a graveyard of Russian tanks remain behind — damaged by artillery, fragments and explosions. 

Oryx, a military and intelligence blog which counts Russia's military losses in Ukraine on the basis of photographs sent from the war zone, reports that Russia has lost more than 460 tanks.  

""They [the tanks] were abandoned or ran out of fuel, and it's finders keepers for these farmers,"" Zbanatski said. ""Their personnel is not properly trained. Their commanding officers are not able to plan their offensive operations properly."" 

Russia's power is now being tested in the eastern Donbas region. The urban environment around Kyiv that gave Ukraine's fighters defensive shelter is now gone and replaced with open terrain and long-range artillery – including dozens of howitzers that Ukraine received from the United States.",b69c658529359249510ce0153928674f5a646f7a,True,False,,,,,0,1650838893,,0,{},i62157g,False,t3_uavt93,False,True,t3_uavt93,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uavt93/why_russia_keeps_losing_so_many_armored_vehicles/i62157g/,1650838910,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650810093.0

St. Petersburg man teaches Ukrainian civilians to defend themselves

The St. Petersburg man is not only a firearms instructor, he’s a finance professor, speaks several languages and he’s also a fugitive recovery agent; commonly known as a bounty hunter.

Robert Marino used his law enforcement and teaching background to teach self-defense in Ukraine  
  
He spent nine days there working with civilians  
  
He’s raising money for volunteers with saveUA.org and is planning to return.

All skills he recently put to use in Ukraine.  
  
“I was sitting on my couch. I have a lot of Ukrainian friends, been there a bunch of times, and I couldn’t take not being able to do something,” Marino said.  
  
Marino connected with a Catholic church in Ukraine and saw that many civilians needed help defending themselves from the Russian attack.  
  
“Without any training, they’re just getting slaughtered. They need to defend themselves,” Marino said.  
  
He packed up and **paid his own way** to get into Ukraine, taking only what he could carry on his back.  
  
He spent nine days in a city in western Ukraine called Lviv.  
  
Going to different villages in the area, he demonstrated firearms, helped set up checkpoints and showed different survival tactics.  
  
“Flashlight in my left hand,” Marino said, showing a picture from Ukraine of his demonstrations. “At night, hold the flashlight in your non-dominant hand. Keep your right hand on your weapon.”  
  
He also experienced first-hand the terror many civilians face, like hearing air raid warnings, with most of them forced to defend themselves for the first time in their life.  
  
“They have shotguns and they’re used to hunting rabbits and birds. And they don’t know how to shoot people, which is a different technique,” Marino said.  
  
That was his main mission: To teach self-defense, not attack.  
  
But he feels even just being there, it helped many civilians feel like they had a fighting chance.  
  
“They were just so happy and motivated and inspired that someone, especially from America, has come there to help them. And train them. I think it was good for morale,” Marino said.  
  
He’s now also raising money for volunteer and aid efforts he saw there and is even preparing to go back again. You can donate and learn more at his site.  
  
Marino also advises anyone else considering to go to Ukraine, that they should have some sort of connection like he did, otherwise they might not be able to help out as effectively.",1f2fab200ffec99534056dca0fccb394d2b8f907,True,False,,,,,0,1650835236,,0,{},i61stnd,False,t3_uajyls,False,True,t3_uajyls,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uajyls/florida_man_doing_some_good/i61stnd/,1650835249,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650806436.0

The other was Ukraine. ""Both countries have consistently voted against this resolution every single year since 2014,"" wrote an article of American magazine Jacobin in January 2022.

&gt; Russia has used about 70% of its arsenal of high-precision missiles, although the country is able to produce them independently.

&gt; &amp;quot;They have about 30% of what they started the war with. There is also the question: who is operating these missiles? After all, the resource that can work with these missiles is also limited. Our intelligence suggests this is about 30 to 40 people. After all, Ukraine is working not only to shoot down and destroy missiles, but also to identify persons who can program these missiles. Therefore, I won&amp;#039;t be surprised if not only hardware but also so-called software runs out in Russia,&amp;quot;Grozev said.

&gt; The enemy also lost 873 main battle tanks, 2,238 armored combat vehicles, 408 artillery systems, 147 MLR systems, 69 air defense systems, 179 aircraft, 154 helicopters, 1,557 motor vehicles, eight ships/cutters, 76 fuel tankers, 191 operational and tactical-level UAVs, 28 units of special equipment, and four tactical missile launchers.

The azov regiment's commanders have been almost entirely swapped out, and currently only about 10% of the regiment expresses neo-nazi affiliations. Due to their experience and political clout from fighting in the donbas and crimea, ukraine is unfortunately not in a position where they can disband them entirely, but they are being slowly phased out. 

It seems likely to me that any remaining azov nazis died already during this war, there wasn't that many and they were all based in Mariupol and the donetsk region. Two birds with one stone, I guess.

Remember everyone, youtube is ALWAYS a suspect source - it preys on the tendency for people to just believe what they watch without skepticism.

These new battalions? Don't know each other or how to work effectively as a unit. Adding to the cluster fuck.

An additional point. Defense has the advantage in war. I've heard military experts, active and retired professionals, say the rule of thumb, at minimum, is 3 offending soldiers for every defender. Currently, Ukraine has just as many soldiers in the fight as Russia does. 

And all of this would need to be 'overcome' by Russia in Ukraine before the consideration of Moldova.

Laughable, considering it was the FBI and DOD that initially reported with the assessment that resulted in said sanctions. The only thing that changed was the administration and their initial policy when it comes to Ukraine which is simply an extension of the Obama era policy. Plenty of other ultra Nationalist groups we can concentrate on as well which in my opinion are even worse.

This is an article from the LA Times interviewing Russian soldiers who fought in Chechnya:  [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-17-mn-22524-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-17-mn-22524-story.html)

Relevant quotes from the Russian's themselves:

“The easiest way is to heat your bayonet over charcoal, and when it’s red-hot, to put it on their bodies, or stab them slowly. You need to make sure they feel as much pain as possible. The main thing is to have them die slowly. You don’t want them to die fast, because a fast death is an easy death. They should get the full treatment. They should get what they deserve. On one hand it looks like an atrocity, but on the other hand, it’s easy to get used to. “I killed about nine people this way. I remember all of them.”

“I remember a Chechen female sniper. She didn’t have any chance of making it to the authorities. We just tore her apart with two armored personnel carriers, having tied her ankles with steel cables. There was a lot of blood, but the boys needed it. After this, a lot of the boys calmed down. Justice was done, and that was the most important thing for them.

“I killed a lot. I wouldn’t touch women or children, as long as they didn’t fire at me. But I would kill all the men I met during mopping-up operations. I didn’t feel sorry for them one bit. They deserved it,” he says. “I wouldn’t even listen to the pleas or see the tears of their women when they asked me to spare their men. I simply took them aside and killed them.”

“Your army is based on professionalism,” said a 27-year-old paratrooper who served alongside U.S. troops as a peacekeeper in Bosnia-Herzegovina. “Our army is based on fervor.”

“What rules? What Geneva Conventions? What difference does it make if Russia has signed them?” said a 25-year-old army officer. “I didn’t sign them, none of my friends signed them. . . . In Russia, these rules don’t work.”

Again, the human condition is barbarism in war.  Modern militaries restrain it.

[],False,,AlderonTyran,,,[],,,,text,t2_cml4w8s,False,False,"""For 30 years the Russians have been painted as the bad guy (along with China) by the Americans despite the Cold War's end. For the first 5-10 of those years their economy was exploited by American megacorps moving in and exploiting cheep labor and vast resources. Then certain people came to power and started reining in said exploitation. Promising to restore Russia to Glory it's not seen since the Russian Tsars. Rebuilding it's architecture, it's culture, economy, military and pride. The Russians went from nearly 3rd world in 1992 to basically 1st world today, all while being sanctioned and hounded by NATO. They saw NATO sponsored  revolutions in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine, they dealt with one (Kazakhstan) themselves, supported the dealing of another (Belarus), and watched as Georgia taken over by a government *desperate* to join NATO. Then they watched the same happen in Ukraine when the incompetents' leadership couldn't figure out the situation and watched as Kiev was engulfed in the fire of revolution. The Russians moved to secure the strategic Crimea, a territory traditionally theirs since Catharine the Great won it for them in 1774 from the Ottomans. Then they watched as neo-nazis gained favor and power in the new *very pro-NATO* government that was forming and watched as Russian Ukrainians declared independence in the East only to not only be denied, but also attacked by paramilitaries willing to commit atrocities. For nearly a decade they watched as the Ukrainians attacked Russians and became more and more violent and vehement in their anti-Russian narrative. Then in 2020, the Ukrainians ask for NATO membership despite not qualifying for it due to the civil war, to no response, not a ""no"", to effective silence. Then they again asked in 2021. a similar response but with more of a ""maybe"" left in the air. Then they asked, *of all things* for nuclear weapons. When Russia was the only one who shot that down, the Russians realized that if they didn't move now, Ukraine would be the latest NATO country, it'd be armed with nukes and governed by neo-nazis with the strongest Anti-Russia streak of any nation in the alliance and *may* be able to push the Americans to attack. So they moved, unprepared and poorly equipped, into a fight they weren't sure they'd win. They hoped that not all the Russo-Ukrainians were killed and some would come to their aid so to end the war bloodlessly or at least quickly. They misunderstood how effective the Ukrainians were at making *everyone* Ukrainian. Even people who were clearly Russian, now claimed to be Ukrainian to escape the persecution. When they advanced through the countryside and captured towns they were greeted politely, (a common curtesy by any civilian hoping to survive a war) and even traded fuel for food with civilians. Then after they retreated from Kiev, they found the civilians who treated them politely butchered by OSB agents for *daring* to comply with the Russians. Then American soldiers were found not only fighting, but leading Ukrainian troops against the Russians. NATO is not only arming their enemy, but also fighting and leading them. So now the Russians realize there's no point in being the good guys, they can't win doing so. If their army must ravish the countryside and burn down cities to win, it's what they'll have to do just to not loose. Because this is the Second Great Patriotic War. They must sacrifice all they can to just have a future lest they be destroyed like every other American conquest. Because that's the thing, they're *not* fighting Ukraine, they're fighting NATO. If they lose this war, they will be destroyed. If not today, then tomorrow. The Americans will be sure of it.""  


I was told this by a Russian when I asked her why she was alright with her two brothers volunteering for the Russian Army. Call it propaganda, call it nationalism, or call it the truth, it doesn't matter. The Russian's think this is a war for survival. *That* is why they cheer their soldiers on, *with flowers and flags*. 

The Russians support this war as much if not *more* than the American's have supported most of their wars for nearly 80 years...
