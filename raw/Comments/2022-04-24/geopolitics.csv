[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,[],,,,text,t2_24531htf,False,False,"Are you agreeing with me? It's not clear to me if the Western general consensus is childish or my own comment (particularly from the tidbit you quoted).

a) There is a Western general consensus that sovereign countries have the right to establish military alliances as they see fit, which there is - at least from what they publicly express. Fact, here's from NATO itself: ""We remain committed to the foundational principles underpinning European and global security, including that each nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements free from outside interference."" - https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_193719.htm

It might seem childish if you take into account that there are other security considerations from nations that might feel threatened and which are not expressed publicly, but that goes beyond the official narrative. 

b) It's not clear to me if you're implying that a country like Ukraine does have the right to establish military alliances as it sees fit but not a country like the Solomon Islands, which would simply reinforce the hypocrisy I was contesting. If this is the case, I assume that this difference would stem from economic disparities as in ""we have more money than you so you have to do what we say"" and which in ethics is expressed in the phrase ""might makes right"" (which is highly unethical, btw). 

c) Also, it is not clear if you're implying that the Solomon Islands does not have a chance to grow from China's support and access to its market, considering its a huge market, from the most populated country in the world, which already has the largest middle-class consumption market segment in the world (see - https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fp_20201012_china_middle_class_kharas_dooley.pdf), and which is currently the second economy in the world but is poised to be the largest and most technologically advanced one in less than a decade - https://www.marketplace.org/2021/12/14/china-could-soon-surpass-u-s-in-crucial-emerging-technologies-report-warns/

In any case, I think that the phrase ""In reality much of the power was thank to economics and less developed countries need the west's support and market if they seek any chance of growth"" is a *non-sequitur*: Whatever might be the reasons behind the power that you are referring to, the position of countries like the US, the UK and Australia with regards to other countries' right to establish military alliances is hypocritical.

Both need each other, USA needs to temporarily shift manufacturing from China to India, Vietnam then India is crucial. India's infrastructure is still developing but still it is crunching in way more than any of China's neighbors and there are already many American companies manufacturing here. 

All India stands to gain from USA is little more FDI and satellite (LEMOA) tech to better monitor its borders. India's leverage comes with its future projections which only from 2010s have come into play.

There is the accusation that a lot of their technical advances have come from Western tech and as that disengagement is in progress it will be interesting to see if they maintain progress. China also appears to be hitting a sustained economic slowdown so it is also interesting to see if space travel remains a national priority.

Japan has some great homegrown tech (successful testing of solar sails) and a track record of cooperation. India is coming along very recently and has signed various collaboration deals with Australia in the last 18 months. At the end of the day though, the US is still far ahead of everyone particularly with NASA partnering with SpaceX. 

The future of space is all US and allies. China can't have sustained partnerships with the amount of toes it's treading on these days, even if it wanted them (the one unlikely possibility of cooperation is if China uses their satellite debris-clearing capacity for everyone's benefit). And Russia will play no part in space except possibly closing off exploration for everyone else out of spite.",0d3aca81118565ea4df3ef5a068cb94ba64d1ea5,True,False,,,,,0,1650823460,,0,{},i610tay,False,t3_ua5iyr,False,True,t3_ua5iyr,/r/geopolitics/comments/ua5iyr/space_blocs_the_future_of_international/i610tay/,1650823470,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650794660.0

Not only that but this guy above went on to say ""lacks any substantive background in geopolitics""....Who tf are you to come to such a premature conclusion?
My guy literally eradicated any credibility afforded to Casagranda because of his radical opinion regarding him. Your opinion is just that, you prefer people that have other avenues of work, so be it. Does not mean you can make absolutist statements regarding the wonderful work these professors have done, without actually analyzing and checking it for internal/external consistency?. His work has been fact checked many many times by myself, my colleagues, and many of my historian friends &amp; professors. We don't just follow blindly, we actually analyze critically as anyone should do and that is because we love it, first and foremost.
Plus idk how deep this guy has gotten into the ""published"" sphere of the history academia world, but I hope he realizes there is a lot of group think that goes on and if a professor does not conform to ""the group"" he/she will be ostracized. The same is experienced in the scientific/medical world and publishing peer reviewed papers. (I'm in the scientific field but have many friends in historical academia and we have discussed this at length). It is sad and disgusting to see, that instead of professors and researchers doing the work for the sake of achieving veracity and conveying truthfulness they do it because they are part of some ""club"" and they all follow some ridiculous script.
If you DARE have any honesty and go against the grain, you will be destroyed and your work will be made to appear non-credible and, in the scientific world, they have gone as far as labeling people ""pseudoscientists"". Upon seeing such an adjective regarding brilliant professors, the lay person right away disqualifies said professor, without actually looking into the work and analyzing it critically.
What a shame that this is what researchers have come to. Obviously not all but a vast majority unfortunately. And then you have idiots online propagating this ignorant group think and shunning others that they have never even studied or researched?!
What a time to be alive. Apologies for the long-winded note, but it just irks me that others put down professors that have been studying for years and convey their work with the utmost honesty.

Roscosmos will build its own space station beginning in 2025. The sudden and dramatic isolation of Russia from the rest of world this year has also affected Roscosmos, so it is unclear if this plan is still going ahead. 

I would be surprised if it did, or if it was ever a remotely viable plan in the first place. At more than $100 billion, the ISS is the single most expensive thing the human race has ever built, and that was with the collected scientific and engineering expertise -- and funding! -- of a multinational coalition. It's also not exactly the cheapest thing in the world to keep running.

Russia was apparently planning to make it a joint effort with China, which makes the financial angle a little more plausible, but it still smacks of ""nationalistic prestige project"" rather than a serious proposal. Roscosmos was already attracting criticism from cosmonauts for growing corruption and lax safety standards, which is a profoundly awful combination when your business is sending people to space and keeping them alive on the return trip.

As with so many other things, it feels like Russia is desperately trying to cling to the external trappings of a superpower -- big military, imperialistic ambitions, space program, prestigious weapons, heavy industry -- while the actual substance of its power rots away.

Caesarism was and is by definition against the moneyed interests of the press, political parties, etc. This was the spirit of all fascist movements in Europe:

''The coming of Caesarism breaks the dictature of money and its political weapon, democracy. After a long triumph of world-city economy and its interests over political creative force, the political side of life manifests itself after all as the stronger of the two. The sword is victorious over the money, the master-will subdues again the plunderer-will. If we call these money-powers 'Capitalism,' then we may designate as Socialism the will to call into life a mighty politico-economic order that transcends all class interests, a system of lofty thoughtfulness and duty-sense that keeps the whole in fine condition for the decisive battle of its history, and this battle is also the battle of money and law. The private powers of the economy want free paths for their acquisition of great resources. No legislation must stand in their way. They want to make the laws themselves, in their interests, and to that end they make use of the tool they have made for themselves, democracy, the subsidized party. Law needs, in order to resist this onslaught, a high tradition and an ambition of strong families that finds its satisfaction not in the heaping-up of riches, but in the tasks of true rulership, above and beyond all money-advantage. A power can be overthrown only by another power, not by a principle, and no power that can confront money is left but this one. Money is overthrown and abolished only by blood. Life is alpha and omega, the cosmic stream in microcosmic form. It is the fact of facts within the world-as-history. Before the irresistible rhythm of the generation-sequence, everything built up by the waking-consciousness in its intellectual world vanishes at the last. Ever in History it is life and life only race-quality, the triumph of the will-to-power and not the victory of truths, discoveries, or money that signifies. World-history is the world court, and it has ever decided in favour of the stronger, fuller, and more self-assured life decreed to it, namely, the right to exist, regardless of whether its right would hold before a tribunal of waking-consciousness.''

&gt;NATO reiterates that in the current and foreseeable security environment, the Alliance will carry out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability, integration, and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces. Accordingly, it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure commensurate with the above tasks. In this context, reinforcement may take place, when necessary, in the event of defence against a threat of aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the United Nations Charter and the OSCE governing principles, as well as for exercises consistent with the adapted CFE Treaty, the provisions of the Vienna Document 1994 and mutually agreed transparency measures. Russia will exercise similar restraint in its conventional force deployments in Europe.

It seems Stoltenberg is laying the foundation for NATO to argue that Russia's invasion of Ukraine represents a fundamental shift in the security environment on the Eurasian continent; therefore, justifying NATO's permanent presence in the East. While I agree with his sentiment, I'm surprised this fundamental shift in NATO's position was underreported to say the least.",0a2e26007f6652fbb27050a9669c750553476c3a,True,False,,,,,0,1650768288,,0,{},i5ydwig,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i5ydwig/,1650768303,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650739488.0
