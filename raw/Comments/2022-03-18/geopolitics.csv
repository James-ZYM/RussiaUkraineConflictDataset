&gt;“I know it’s hard for Jews abroad to understand, but these actions were intended as anti-Russian, not anti-Jewish,” Petukov said. “And when it comes to those supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and culture, this is really a tiny element.”  
Now part of the national guard, the battalion of 900 to 1,500 members publicly claims to eschew all Nazi ideology.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Batozsky said he worked closely with the Azov Battalion during the 2014-15 conflict behind the scenes as a political consultant in Donetsk. It is this work, and his outspoken defense of Ukrainian efforts to defeat the separatists, that he says put him on the Russian hit list — and also that makes him confident that Russian charges of neo-Nazis in Ukraine are inaccurate.  
“They were soccer hooligans and wanted attention, so yeah, I was shocked when I saw guys with swastika tattoos,” he said about the Azov members he got to know. “But I talked with them all the time about being Jewish and they had nothing negative to say. They had no anti-Jewish ideology.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Daniel Kovzhun, a Jew from Kyiv who ran logistics during the war in Donetsk for paramilitary units, described a similar experience.  
“There were Orthodox Jews in Azov,” he said. “I know because I was there on the battle lines. No one cared who was Jewish, we cared about keeping our country together.”  
Like Batozsky, Kovzhun, who lived and studied in Israel before returning to Kyiv, has joined the newly formed civilian army in Kyiv, the Territorial Defense Forces — an overnight volunteer force that has attracted Jewish fighters across the country, and even from abroad.",b20370d57832641374e2ce2db70b4fcb755a2469,True,False,,,,,0,1647625501,,0,{},i16hn45,False,t3_th3svd,False,True,t1_i162ag6,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i16hn45/,1647625518,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647596701.0,

I provided a few in the link above on the local level. And these were just the ones that were caught. There are many more. They all skew the national figures tremendously.  
  
Remember, China is largely an exporting country. International trade still accounts for most of its GDP. The Chinese are reluctant to admit this, because it exposes their vulnerabilities. That's why China got so pummeled in the US-China trade war. China can't afford to lose its largest customer. Those hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions account for a huge percentage of its economy, and without that, the country would collapse in an instant.  
  
Why can't China transition its economy away from exports? Because the vast majority of its population (over a billion people), are extremely poor and can't afford what China's economy produces. Chinese premier Li Keqiang himself admitted that over 600 million Chinese have a monthly income of US$140 or less ($4 a day or less): https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/china-has-over-600-million-poor-with-140-monthly-income-premier-li-keqiang-6024341.htm. That figure has since gotten worse from the economic shock caused by COVID.  
  
You really think a country with most of its population living on just a few dollars a day has a GDP of $14 trillion? China is not much richer than India, a country of similar population, and that economy has a GDP that's officially five times smaller. I mean, it's ludicrous to think that a country could somehow add $10 trillion to its GDP in a little over ten years, despite two global recessions, a devastating trade war, and the world's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  
  
The US is dumb enough to think that China somehow poses a challenge to its control of the world's oceans, despite the Chinese navy not even being able to secure a small body of water just off shore from it (the South China Sea), and not being able to do anything but launch temper tantrums whenever the US sails a war ship through the Taiwan Strait, so perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that so many foreign governments have been fooled into thinking the Chinese economy is as large as China says it is.",222be23cea1d829ac5cf346666063a8db8ba4798,True,False,,,,,0,1647624451,,0,{},i16ey4g,False,t3_tdxfij,False,True,t1_i14qllg,/r/geopolitics/comments/tdxfij/the_return_of_pax_americana_putins_war_is/i16ey4g/,1647624463,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647595651.0,

In particular, Stratfor was always forecasting that China's decline was just around the corner, since at least the late 90s.

So when I got his book, which was far more speculative than Stratfor, I wasn't inclined to give his long term prognostications the benefit of the doubt.

With regards to Mexico, I agree that it has population, a reasonable GDP,and access to both oceans.  But it has so many problems.

Kalyvas actually support's Mearsheimer's status as an observer when he points out that Mearsheimer predicted that the war would be ruinous for Russia. Clearly Mearsheimer saw that war was one possible outcome. And Russia is suffering ruin.

Ethnic conflicts are a given in politics. Those who believe in a post ethnic identity, some sort of global liberal man, are as mistaken as the Russian, Chinese, etc. in their believe that all the minorities under their tutelage want to be part those empires. I don't think realists deny the power of ideology or ethnicity. 

Is there even a European man?

At the moment, Lithuanians, Poles and perhaps even Hungarians are reliving Soviet Russian violence through events in Ukraine. Don't forget though, the peoples of Europe have many conflicts. Poland attacked Lithuania when it sought independence. Poland also fought against Ukrainian separatism. In fact, Poland's ethnic diversity weakened it before the Second World War.

Hungary lost lots of territory to Romania and routinely offers citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries. Maybe even those in Ukraine.

Russia may be the biggest bully but it is not the only nation or polity that will kill to force people to join it's political order if it comes to that.

""U.S. and allied policymakers have no doubt begun to consider what measures can be taken should that come to pass, especially given the likelihood that a determined Ukrainian insurgency will continue to resist Russian occupation. As they study whether and how to support this resistance, including with a steady flow of arms, it is worth remembering that this is not the first time the United States has faced this question: during the Cold War, Washington backed more than more than two dozen insurgencies fighting Soviet-backed governments or Soviet occupation, from Albania in the 1940s to Afghanistan in the 1980s.  
The history of these efforts should be studied carefully as policymakers face the prospect of beginning another one in Ukraine. That record should counsel caution for the United States and its allies. In most cases, support brought few gains, heavy costs, and serious unintended consequences, and demanded a much longer and more significant commitment than anticipated at the start.""",05b62ffd0f0bedd6543961a845c70faaacb9b2ba,True,False,,,,,0,1647616957,,0,{},i15vo6f,True,t3_th3svd,False,True,t3_th3svd,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i15vo6f/,1647616971,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647588157.0,

One option is, Russia, having demonstrated military superiority, can then choose to pull its forces back, to only occupy Ukraine east of the Dnieper to fulfill its strategy security goals, but that leaves Ukraine open to resupply in the west and revive its war fighting efforts.

Second is a fully fledged occupation.

On top of that, at this stage, Ukraine's military will melt into an insurgency that will turn it into Afghanistan.

The most Putin is likely going to get is ceding of Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.

Strategic tasks related to the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, access to the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the establishment of control over the left bank of Ukraine remain unfulfilled. The enemy partially managed to temporarily occupy settlements and establish control over the routes in the Donetsk and Pivdennobuzhsky operational districts.

The enemy is trying to take measures to increase the number of troops in the direction of Kyiv by moving uncoordinated and incompetent units from the Central and Eastern military districts.

Due to the consumption of almost all missile ammunition and some types of ammunition, the military-political leadership decided to transfer the enterprises of the russian military-industrial complex involved in the production of ""Caliber"" and ammunition to MLRS ""Tornado"" to round-the-clock .

No significant changes in the activities of the occupying forces have been recorded in the Volyn, Polissya and Siversky areas. The enemy focused on the fortification equipment of the occupied frontiers.

In the Slobozhansky and Sumy areas, units of the russian occupation forces are not conducting active offensive operations, the enemy is regrouping and trying to establish logistical support. The occupiers are more active in reconnaissance.

russian terrorist forces do not stop trying to capture the city of Izyum, strengthen the group by introducing additional units, take measures to organize engineering and logistics.

In the Luhansk region, the enemy intensified hostilities in the area of the village of Rubizhne, has partial success. It continues to shell unprotected civilian infrastructure in order to intimidate the local population and limit the actions of the defense forces.

In the Donetsk region, the enemy did not conduct active hostilities.

In the Tavriya direction, the enemy is trying to establish a strict administrative and police regime in the temporarily occupied settlements of the Kherson region.

No active actions of the Russian occupiers were noted in the South Bug direction.

Moreover, let's war game this out.  I don't know why you keep saying send in the 101st, but I'm guessing you don't have a lot of warfighting experience.  Sending in an American military unit, would result in a military response from Russia.  Possibly nuclear.  Let's say they only use a tactical nuke.  Ok.  That's really bad.  There goes the 101st and a chunk of Ukraine.  How do we respond?  Game theory suggests we need to escalate.  Do we hit a Russia city?  And then they respond, pretty soon we are throwing nukes at each other.  And the only off ramp is if we let them throw a punch at us for free, which might avert Armageddon, but would crush NATO and give Russia free reign.

Let's keep it conventional instead.  Many sources will tell you that Russia has terrible logistics and morale, putting aside that's not really true, you know what will bolster morale?  Russian forces being attacked by American military units.  

Further, our logistics system is amazing, but it's not magic.  How will we resupply our troops?  The black sea is controlled by Russia and I doubt Turkey is going to help us on this non article 5 military adventure.  To the north is Belarus, ostensibly neutral, de facto in Russia's grip.  Are we declaring war on Belarus and fighting our way across an 'innocent' nation to get to the front?  To the south, Moldova and especially Transnitria do NOT want us in their airspace much less their land.  Which leaves and narrow strip from Romania to Ukraine and the Polish border.  All to get troops to a nation that is completely surrounded by Russia, it's allies, and the water that it controls.  That's a dangerous supply line at best.

Maybe you don't want to join the Ukraine fight.  Maybe we should just attack Russia directly, again, putting aside Nukes, where do we attack from?  Finland and Turkey are going to politely refuse.  Poland and Romanian don't have access, which leaves the Baltics. 

They lack militaries, they are full of Russian minorites, they have no defensible terrain and they won't risk being invaded.  Which leaves, an amphibious invasion.  That would be a bloodbath for us.  I guess we could just airdrop the 101st in directly, but that's pretty risky, with limited gain.  What prevents Putin from hitting them all with a missile like he did the foreign legion earlier this week?  How will they fight armor and air power?

My point is, it's easy to say, just go fight them if you don't understand what fighting entails.

A subservient Ukraine could then serve as a staging ground for the next war, similar to how Belarus was used.  Putin’s long term objective is to restore the territorial “influence” of Russia over the former Soviet States.  Putin is a Nationalist who must restore the former glory of Russia as a central figure in Europe’s power dynamic.

Even assuming that he accepts that the war didn’t go as planned and agrees to compromise; he would still claim Crimea and Donbas as Russian.  By retaining these territories, he “proves” the legitimacy of his vision for the future, allowing for yet another invasion.

Ukraine is fighting to maintain its independence.  Their goals are to have a democratically elected government and sufficient military strength to deter future aggression.  I’m not really sure what their feelings are on Crimea but there’s no indication that Ukraine is willing to give up any of its territory.

The problem here is a lack of shared vision for the future.  Ukraine sees itself as an independent member of a global economy while Putin sees them as a just one of many colonial style puppet states under Russian control.  

Putin can not accept an independent Ukraine; this would destroy his vision for the future of Russia and its power over Europe.

At this point, Ukraine is effectively fighting to bring down Putin and fundamentally change the future vision for Russia.  

The Russian President can no longer be a colonial super power pulling the strings on multiple puppet states.  Russia must choose a new path and therefore find a new leader.

That said from what we *do* know. Russia is having severe logistical issues, Fuel shortages, Ammunition shortages, Inability to feed their front lines, breakdown of barracks at the Ukrainian border due to lack of supply. We don't know why the logistics of Russia are so abysmal. But it's 100% confirmed that they are. Maybe there's such rampant corruption within the Russian military that funds for equipment got siphoned away so the logistics on paper is completely disconnected from the logistics on the ground.

Secondly. Most high-end electronics is *not* made in China. It's made in *Taiwan*. All modern high-end chips are made at TSMC which has its plants in Taiwan. The machinery used to produce these chips are made in Europe. Both Taiwan and Europe has sanctioned Russia on the technology front. And China doesn't have the machinery necessary to supply Russia with the electronics used in modern military equipment, industry and luxury consumer electronics. Russia for example is unable to produce new S400 missiles, which is why they have barely been used this conflict to disable Ukrainian planes.

The reason why China is staying neutral on this matter and distancing itself from Russia is precisely for the opposite reason of what you're saying. China isn't really in a position to retaliate against the west at the moment.

Supporting Ukraine with weapons and sanctioning Russia is the right thing to do, just because letting them do whatever they want would bite us again, in the form of other countries invasion. Once the message is sent and the damage dealt, there's no need to prolong them.

Unless their intelligence was so poor that they believed Ukraine would fold like paper and that the citizens were just waiting to cheer on their Russian liberators, I just don’t see an endgame here.  The Russian intelligence agencies are often looked at in an even higher light than the US ones and have been one of their strongest assets; a total failure of that magnitude seems out of character, especially given how they had conducted operations before in Ukraine leading up to this.  If Russia/Putin had been planning this, why wait all of this time and why not invade in 2014 when the rest of the world was expecting and the response would’ve been far more light, both militarily and internationally?  Why spend so much time posturing and gathering troops to launch an operation that didn’t have the logistics for continued operation?

Depending on where things are in the coming months, I’d say to keep a close eye on Russia’s interactions with China.  There are already some signs that China could help alleviate a lot of the pressure on the Russian economy.

But it's a real misunderstanding to assume that the *only* meaningful consideration in US foreign policy is ""What benefits us the most"", and that any talk of actually caring about democracy and human rights is just a convenient set of lies.

Americans are taught from a young age that our country stands for freedom and democracy, and for many Americans this is a key part of our sense of national identity. Whether this belief is actually supported by the historical record is beside the point -- the fact that enough Americans believe in it means there is political pressure on our leaders to live up to it. And that's true even if we assume the people who rise to the highest political offices are all cold-blooded pragmatists, and not democracy true believers themselves.

Of course that political pressure only goes so far. As a practical matter, our leaders can generally get away with cooperating with oppresive, authoritarian regimes (although there will be some political blowback whenever those regimes decide to step up the level of oppression). But something like invading a neighboring democracy would be political suicide for a US president in 2022, in a way that it does not appear to be for Putin and it probably would not be for Xi.

Of course, it's a bit easier to sell an invasion to the US public if our leaders can make the case that we're fighting a dictator who's oppressing his own people (although the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have probably made us a bit more wary of that sort of justification).

The US, I expect, will attempt to use their traditional methods (as seen in Eastern Europe and in their relationship with Russia) such as economic incentive, alliance building and deeper military entrenchment to force the Chinese into a corner where they are more likely to take actions that lead to East Asian nations attempting to divest their economies away from China. 

Taking action to prevent Chinese growth does not mean that the US will be successful, only that they will *try* to do so. I also think that, based on the US track record, they will quickly  throw out the carrot and start resorting to the stick if their traditional methods begin to fall short of expectations. That is where we will see some heavy handed use of military escalation, by way of pushing for the expansion of their existing presence in Asia and by threatening to withdraw completely if they do not get the support they need from their allies. 

While the Asian economy is heavily dependent on China, it can hardly be said that they want to fall completely within its sphere of influence, with no great power alternative to counterbalance that influence. I think that, when push comes to shove, the United States will be able to convince its allies to support a degree of military deployment that China is likely to find unacceptable, just as they did with Russia. 

While the rhetoric implies otherwise, I remain unconvinced that the US is looking forward to meeting the challenge that China poses. Much the same as in Ukraine, I am inclined to think that their narrative and their global position has written them into a corner, so to speak, where they cannot find a way out that will save face and maintain their credibility, so their approach appears to be trying to deter China from making that play at all. As we saw with Eastern Europe, that kind of deterrence is effective until it very suddenly isn't.

Good question. Brace yourself for a word limit pushing answer!

My advice will likely be unpopular because it has about as much emotional and ideological feeling as a crocodile in cold water. I would advise US foreign policy makers to heavily prioritise Asia over Europe. In practice this would involve making a compromise over the balance of power in Eastern Europe to assuage Russian security concerns while strengthening the military capabilities of Europe to act independently of the US while being careful to maintain its status as the primary supplier of equipment and de-facto head of the alliance.

I'll provide 5 reasons why I think the US should prioritise Asia.

1. **China has far more potential to surpass the United States in approaching decades than either Russia or even the Soviet Union ever did.**

\- This is a modern day Thucydides Trap, where the United States must either confront China or let a window of opportunity slip past them. It's not a narrow window of opportunity, but eventually China will grow into a beast capable of *regional parity* with the US. Note: I'm not suggesting they'll be able to fight the US head to head, that would would take a series of very unfortunate complementarily devastating events for the US to weaken to the point where it could be matched by China in open warfare where no side has a logistical advantage.

To have absolute confidence that conflict between China and US won't happen, one must be convinced with 100% certainty of one of two things; either a) China will never surpass the US, or b) the US is willing to accept losing its primacy among world powers.

I can't express 100% confidence in either.

**2. The US already outcompeted a much stronger Russia during the Cold War.**

\- Russia is not an unknown quantity. Their strategic interests are clear. Their concerns are well documented. Their issues and weaknesses are heavily analysed. It is entirely possible to create a situation where Russian immediate strategic interests are satisfied, but Russia remains a manageable and non-peer rival to the United States, one that can annoy, but never truly threaten (excepting the nuclear arsenal of course, which they are less likely to turn to with no conventional threat on their border).

Further, the US has outperformed them in the past, when Russia had far more relative quality and quantity backing their interests. Today, Russian conventional capability is no threat to the US. To be brutally honest, the US is safe behind the two largest moats on Earth: the Atlantic and the Pacific.

Simply put, if I, with the information that I have available to me, was to put together a cost/benefit analysis for the US with regards to splitting their attention between Europe, the Middle East and Asia, I could find compelling arguments for Asia, and an appreciable position for the Middle East, but unfortunately Eastern Europe affects the US far less by comparison and diverts too many resources away from the other two more important regional competitions that the US is committed to pursuing.

3. **Russia cannot keep China afloat the same way that China can keep Russia afloat.**

\- This is a point that is inherently on a timer. It is technically possible for Russia to stabilize and revitalize (any country with access to colossal natural resources has that potential) and if they do, then once we factor in the notion that they will be one of the few countries to truly benefit from climate change, it is possible that they will be in a position to heavily influence a future conflict between the US and China.

BUT...that is not the reality of the situation today and it is unlikely to be the case for the near future. Even assuming a worst case scenario (for the West) in Ukraine, Russia will need drastic reform and a lot of internal time and effort and investment to position themselves as a true peer adversary.

Right now, if the PRC and the US were to be involved in a conflict in and around the South China Sea, Russian support would likely be limited to material supply of equipment and resources and third-party action (emboldening regional powers like Iran) and taking steps to ensure the US cannot comfortably engage in full SEAD and DEAD over all of mainland China (by body-blocking in North East China, having ships in Chinese ports and being a general nuisance without actually participating).  


4. **Does the current state of the Russian Military warrant expanded US presence in Europe?**

\- Despite the point I am about to make, I would add that I am rather sceptical of the one sided narrative we have been receiving on the Russian militaries performance in Ukraine, due to the many obfuscating factors such as fog of war, lack of urgency on the part of the Russians (direct US intervention taken off the table/sanctions immediately applied were more or less everything and the kitchen sink), a steadily (for the Russians) advancing front-line, etc etc.

That said, the Russian military has enormous issues with corruption, inflexibility and inadequate training compared with the US. This is all well documented and, more valuably in my eyes than the present conflict, carefully analysed \*after\* the fact in conflicts like Georgia and direct comparisons to their performance in Syria (that said, the Russian performance in Syria exceeded Western Expectations, but that was limited to their air-force, the use of which has been notably reserved in this conflict).

During the Cold War, without direct US involvement, Europe likely could not have stopped the Soviets had they decided to conventionally invade West Germany. I think it goes without saying that today, the balance of force in Europe is far more favourable to the West, even without the United States.

Of course, there are issues with that argument. Germany's neglect of the military (the $100b they've allocated is, in my opinion, not nearly enough to restore their 'paper' capabilities, let alone improve and expand them), the specialisation of the French military (expeditionary neo-colonial pursuit) and the unwillingness of Poland to involve itself without boots-on-the-ground support from its Western Allies, etc etc. 

However, while European defence is not without its weaknesses, I do think that the Russian's have failed to demonstrate the quality and performance consistency to truly necessitate the narrative that the US is the only thing between Russia and Europe. 

5. **What does the US stand to lose/gain from either eventuality.**

\- I fail to see what the US stands to gain by confronting Russia in a manner that can escalate to war. Beyond assuring their allies and 'securing' Europe, the risks posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal are simply too dangerous to approach as if it were a bluff, even if it were.

I'm sure Russia would much rather be confident in its ability to fight conventionally, but the reality as it stands today is that they are not, hence their readiness to lean on their Nuclear Arsenal as the heavy hanging promise of what escalation with the west is likely to entail.

China on the other hand, has far more cards to play and, at the moment, far higher ceilings they can potentially reach. Not only that, but they also cannot realistically rely on their nuclear arsenal to ensure complete mutually assured destruction (assuming ballistic missile interception actually works as intended and the United States strikes first and can secure mission kills on a significant portion of China's nuclear capability).

Therefore, a conflict between the US and China is far less likely to go nuclear than say, open war between the US and Russia in Eastern Europe. Further, it cannot be stated enough what a conventional defeat in Taiwan or the South China Sea would do to the United States. The US cannot afford to lose its credibility in Asia as it would affect them on every level, from their internal and international reputation to their global position and stranglehold over critical world trade lanes.

**Conclusion:**

My personal conclusion is that primacy over the Pacific, is far more valuable to US interests than primacy in Eastern Europe. If it came to a choice, I would advise foreign policy makers to choose Asia. If they can be everywhere at once and emerge successful in their policy objectives (note: success is different from winning), then power to them. But I think attempting it would be a mistake because it is safer to focus on China first and then swing back around to the European rivalry that is familiar and proven.",f1778f71302572b4ba82aa96893dc9dcddd8c8ee,True,False,,,,,0,1647572479,,0,{},i13vlol,True,t3_teijzm,False,True,t1_i10np1p,/r/geopolitics/comments/teijzm/how_overlapping_core_interests_reinforces_the/i13vlol/,1647572495,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647543679.0,

Russias security concerns around NATO are real and justified as were Ukrainian concerns around Russian. As has played out. The two concepts can coexist you know, in fact they feed off one another. 

Putin has strange ideas about Ukraine, but mainly, similar to those of the UK and northern Ireland, and many other disputed areas, he believes it belongs in Russia. Now I don't believe he is naive or stupid enough to think he could hold Ukraine, perhaps he did but I think he wanted to hold Dombas declare 'independant states'  decapitate Zelensky government by killing him, and pull back all within days, I believe he had China on board for this, then let the west sort out the western part of Ukraine and even if it eventually joins NATO he has that strategicly important bit around the black sea, the new lines of the cold war are drawn up as he believes as many in the West do a new era of West against the East is dawning. and he wanted to make the first move.

Map of military operations and the situation on the fronts on the evening of March 17

Front South. The situation is more or less calm. Kim speaks of explosions in the center of Nikolaev region. Either our artillery is finishing off the remnants of an AFU tank battalion in Bashtanka, or it's strikes in the Krivoy Rog direction, where our forces are trying to force the Ingulets River, and judging by AFU reports, in places it works out, we need to entrench on the left bank. Nikolaev is blockaded, but there is no assault. Odessa is watching our ships, from which it periodically dots and languidly waits for the Russian landing force, which is in no hurry to land. Judging by the video from the net, mines start detonating on the beach, without waiting for the Russians to disembark.

Front East. In Mariupol the liberation of the city continues. Advance units of troops have reached the central districts, the AFU is retreating to Azovstal. The evacuation of civilians in the city continues. According to the military on the front line, Mariupol will be fully liberated within 4-7 days. In Gulyaypol the situation is not clear. In Ugledar, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have retreated, but we have not yet occupied the city. East of Ugledar, DNR and Russian forces have advanced further north and are moving towards Kurakhovo. On the Avdeevka-Gorlovka line there is less success, we are consolidating our positions and repelling counterattacks. As for Izyum, yesterday's situation continues, slowly but surely the RF Armed Forces are approaching Slavyansk, but there are still blocked AFU forces in the south of Izyum. The LNR army is pleased again - tonight the flag of the republic was hoisted on the administration building of Rubizhne, Ukrainian soldiers retreated to Severodonetsk, where serious battles are also taking place. Near Kharkiv, there are no changes, there are positional battles and artillery firefights, the information that our troops took Chuguev was not confirmed.

Front North. Yesterday the AFU forces attempted a counterattack northwest of Kiev. The attempt failed, our troops were apparently warned about the maneuver and the Ukrainian military was ambushed. Today it was reported that our troops went on the attack in this direction and defeated the enemy column in Vyshgorod. East of Kiev, our troops are strengthening their rear and flanks, and several settlements have come under our control. Again, spot strikes were launched against targets in Sarny (Rivne Region).

Also worth noting are reports of AFU strikes on residential areas of Melitopol and Kozachya Lopan. This is very similar to retaliation against the inhabitants of the settlements that were taken over by the Russian Federation.

 Situation in Mariupol as of 23.00 on 17 March 2022

There are no special advances by the end of the day: in the west of the city there is a fight with sniper pairs and calculations of the ATGMs. No progress was made south of the RF Armed Forces Police Academy.

To the east, Chechen units were able to gain a foothold in the gardens and groves on the coast in the Levoberezhny district. ""Azovstal is still behind the enemy.

Active fighting is taking place in the north, but there is no clear line of territorial control.

The refugees were actively withdrawn from Zhovtnevyi district today.



(Russia MoD)

Briefing by Russian Defence Ministry:
 
The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, continuing the successful offensive, took control of Novomayorskoye and Prechistovka. The advance was 10 kilometers.

 In total, over the past day, aviation and air defence of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down 1 Ukrainian helicopter Mi-24 near Belki settlement, as well as 5 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles, including 1 Bayraktar TB-2.

Operational-tactical and army aviation hit 29 military assets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 

 Among them: 1 multiple launch rocket system, 3 command posts, including 1 mobile field command post of the brigade, 6 ammunition depots and 14 areas of military equipment concentration.

 In total, 182 aircraft and helicopters, 177 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,393 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 134 multiple launch rocket systems, 523 field artillery and mortars, as well as 1,182 units of special military vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed during the operation.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces continue to make steady territorial gains around Mariupol and are increasingly targeting residential areas of the city.

Ukrainian forces northwest of Kyiv launched several local counterattacks and inflicted heavy damage on Russian forces.

Ukrainian forces repelled Russian operations around Kharkiv and reported killing a regimental commander.

Ukrainian intelligence reports that Russia may have expended nearly its entire store of precision cruise missiles in the first twenty days of its invasion.

Russian forces deployed unspecified reserve elements of the 1st Guards Tank Army and Baltic Fleet Naval Infantry to northeastern Ukraine on March 17.

Russia may be parceling out elements of the reserve force that could conduct an amphibious operation along the Black Sea coast to support ongoing assaults on Mariupol, further reducing the likelihood of a Russian amphibious assault on Odessa.
