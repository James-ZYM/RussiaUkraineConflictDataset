Russian claims of shooting down hundred Bayraktars are just as implausible as Ukrainian claims of shooting down hundred Russian planes.

There's no reason to expect all ground vehicle losses to be so well documented, with well over 50% of even the highest loss figures having pics, while air losses are somehow all invisible.

Right now, all evidence points to nobody having good AA. Both sides are making shit up about their AA prowess.

Overall it's not surprising, Russian AA both sides use was always shit. Arabs have been mass buying best Soviet and Russian AA tech since the 1960s, and it never did them any good.

Russian air power is also underwhelming now, but then again, when it was ever better? It's all in line with history.

https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1504935429770027008?t=kS6VTmGl-uYJ8-4t34vJcw&amp;s=19

A supplemental point from me:

A lot of folks talk about a war of attrition happening like Russia is bound to win it. That may very well be the case, but it isn't clear.

Defenders tend to have the advantage in wars of attrition. In theory Russia has a bigger military than Ukraine, but not in practice. 

Russia had 190k troops in the country when they started. The Ukranian army was at 200k before the war, but also has 900k reservists.

Russia's ability to deploy more force is limited for three reasons. First, theybhave security commitments elsewhere they must attend to, and cannot deploy 100% of their military to Ukraine. Second, a total mobilization of Russian society would risk social problems for Putin because the ""special military operation"" concept is prefaced on it being low cost to ordinary Russians. Third, more troops means more logistics, and Russia already has problems with logistics.

Meanwhile, Ukraine is likely to activate all 1.1 million soldiers if they can arm them. They probably won't activate everyone but they will likely field a significant portion, combined with foreign volunteers.

The rule is, to my understanding, that an offensive force should strive to outnumber a defender 3:1. Instead Russia is the force outnumbered, possibly by 2:1 or 3:1 margins.

Considering the (reported) present loss of frontline troops, the difficulty in getting reinforcements, the implausibility of deploying a greater number of troops, and the morale gap between attackers and defenders, I think there is a good argument that Ukraine would be favored in a war of attrition.",6795d8d5e5f19e0e0e701fc49161aa9cd6527f25,True,False,,,,,0,1647644088,,0,{},i17qphz,False,t3_th1yuy,False,True,t3_th1yuy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/th1yuy/ukraine_megathread_march_18/i17qphz/,1647644100,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647615288.0,

Why is the prospect of a Russian victory ""fearful""?

If anything, a long drawn out scenario is worse for the world that a rapid Russian victory.  There is zero long term benefit in the west trying to isolate Russia other than Cold War relitigation - and the Cold War brought us global American support for some truly awful regimes all for the sake of stopping communism and forcing market liberalization for cheap American corporate access to commodities.  Ukraine is not strategically important to the West, and preoccupying development dollars to rebuilding Eastern Europe is basically conceding Africa to China.  Biden's admin is barely staffing offices in countries key to a renewable energy future in Africa as it is (I develop solar in Africa, if you want to talk about fearful, our complete lack of effort in winning over African countries sitting on critical resources for renewable energy supply chains is going to be bad news in 20 years when even the GOP admits we need to divest from fossil fuels).

Very few societies are 100% meritocratic or 100% nepotistic - usually it's a balance between the two (consider how much ""office politics"" determines promotions rather than merit in the United States for example). 

In some societies - and I think it could be argued Russia is one such example - the dictator does not have absolute power but rather rules with the support of a handful of key factions (military, economic elites, security, intelligence agencies, etc.). In these societies merit still matters (as each faction vies for more power, and thus internally merit is required) but it's often blunted by nepotism. They oscillate back and forth between merit-based appointments and nepotism, never falling wholly into one camp or the other. In some cases, nepotism may be a baseline requirement (i.e., we're only going to recruit from the internal elite) which shrinks the candidacy pool, but after the nepotism test is passed, the job may go to the person with the highest merit.

While I don't know about ""some of the NATO allies"", the US military's experience over the last four decades has been to fight against a sanction-weakened adversary (twice!) and having, arguably, lost in the face of a fierce insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. To the extent that it's troops have served in these engagements, yes they have battle experience but if you look at the troop rotation numbers, you will find that the experience has been restricted to a small number of formations.

At least doctrinally, the Soviet/Russian military system was/is quite sophisticated (""deep battle, the Russian version of ""unrestricted warfare"" etc.). In terms of approach to warfare, the Russians have always favoured mass over dexterity. This we have seen since their WW2 operations (though there one has to also factor in the fact that this choices may have been limited since they were facing a op-tactically skillfull adversary).

Aside from the Arab-Israeli Wars, Iran-Iraq War, and to a limited extent the Indo-Pak Wars, there hasn't really been any high-intensity combined arms warfare. One could argue (as I am sure you probably would) that both the US war against Iraq are examples of high-intensity combined arms engagements and in the initial phases they could be considered to be so.

But the war that Russia is currently waging against Ukraine is not a high-intensity combined arms one. As someone else in this discussion put it, the Russians seem to have approached it from an ""enhanced or high intensity police action"" only to realise that the venture they have embarked on is nothing of the kind. Given the Russian partiality to artillery and rocket systems, a high intensity engagement (from the Russian perspective) would be devastating for Ukraine (as I am sure some parts of Ukraine are already experiencing).

The above does not discount or underplay what I consider to be some rather obvious strategic blunders evident in the Russian actions, particularly in the initial phases of the war. I would go even so far as to say that they have lost the initiative on the battlefield to Ukraine despite the fact that they may succeed in grinding down the Ukrainian defence.

But, as a net assessment, I would not agree with you that the Russian military is as incompetent as it's being made out to be (all one has to do is to look through the twitter threads in which some military analysts and scholars whose work I follow regularly seem to have let their personal biases overcome a more sober and objective (to the extent possible) assessment).",a5ae590fbaa96e6793360cbbbf09fa5c29effe6b,True,False,,,,,0,1647639440,,0,{},i17g3tq,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i166koz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i17g3tq/,1647639455,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647610640.0,

First, taking the whole east of the country would involve taking Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernikiv which the Russian Army has not been able to do to this point. That alone seems like a tall order without major reinforcements and logistical improvement. They might hit 100k casualties if they try. My point is that it's just part 1, and it's not certain they can even do that.

Second, occupying only half the country would be a nightmare for Russia. They would need to guard a huge rear area while Ukraine set up a strong defensive line with a free hand in the west. It would mean achieving no political goals at great cost and risk a stalemate they cannot afford.

Third, Russia has been pretty bad at occupying territory so far. Even if they advance to the Dniper, which again would only happen at great cost, they would still be fighting Ukranian territorial defense and partisans and wouldn't have safe supply routes to their forward positions.

But my larger point here is more strategic than tactical. If Russia loses its bridgehead on the north bank, it has two bad options. One would be an all-out assault on Kyiv, the other being to declare East Ukraine a state and committ to a long term occupation.

Well, it's not really an explanation of attack happening, quote, *right now*: for those exact demographic reasons it would be better to attack *earlier*. Assuming demographics played important role (reasonable assumption), the crucial issue was: why it didn't happen earlier? (answering which would help identifying reasons why the attack happened *right now*).


&gt; Is it possible that Putin and his inner circle thought this was the ""last chance"" to attack with sufficient manpower before the global strategic situation made military offensive operations of this magnitude impossible?

Argument against: it certainly wasn't his Plan A (or: preferred option) to engage in protracted war of attrition (where demographics would be one of major factors).

&gt; Europe - according to the long-term trend

We don't know what long-term trend is. What we know is short term trend and what is being declared - under current circumstances and because of current circumstances, which by definition isn't and can't be seen as long-term trend.


&gt; China the demographic situation (and therefore the economic!) is such that an attack on Taiwan would have to take place in the next few years while they are still in a position of strength


They will still have tremendous advantage over Taiwan in 20 or 50 years. They are expanding peacefully (e.g. in Africa), gaining access to more resources. You'd need a list of really good reasons for China not to bide their time.


&gt; Beijing would certainly have preferred it if Russia had marched through quickly and NATO (and thus the USA) had been massively occupied in Europe. 

My guess is, were Russia able to quickly (and with minimal resistance) install their own puppet regime in Kyev (Putin's Plan A), NATO wouldn't be engaged that much.


&gt; it would have been much more rational not to use up the remaining manpower in a war of aggression, but to smoothly moderate Russia's relative decline from a superpower in the 80s to a great power know to a regional power in the future

[],False,,jrex035,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k929ak,False,False,"&gt;Also, what would happen if the Russian forces captured Kyiv?

This is *extremely* unlikely in my opinion. Kyiv is a city of 3 million residents, held by likely tens of thousands (if not more than 100,000) Ukrainian forces (professional army, TDF, Foreign Legion, local militia), and its had weeks to prepare its defenses. A battle for a city of this size would likely require the entire Russian military in Ukraine to even have a chance at being successful, and that's clearly not possible. Typically in urban warfare you need at least 3:1 troops compared with the defender, more preferably 5:1 or more. Russia literally doesn't have that many troops. Note that Russia is still struggling to take much smaller, less well defended cities like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolayiv. 

&gt;Realistically speaking, what is the odd of them repelling the invasion.

In my opinion, very high. Many analysts have noted that ~200,000 Russian forces isn't nearly enough to capture, let alone hold, very much territory in Ukraine. We're 3 weeks into the conflict and most of the fronts have ground down into a stalemate already, and the only one that's seeing much progress at all is in the Southeast where gains are still minimal. 

What Ukraine needs to do, and seemingly is doing, is turning this into a costly war of attrition for Russia in which their territorial gains don't make up for the losses they're suffering. Russia can't afford (quite literally in fact) to keep up this conflict indefinitely, while Ukraine essentially has an unlimited supply of advanced equipment, ammo, body armor, etc being pumped into it by the West. 

And if US casualty estimates are to be believed (and they fit what OSINT is saying) Russia has already suffered 7,000 KIA. WIA tends to be at least double KIA which means Russia has already seen more than 10% of its forces lost just 3 weeks into the conflict. This also matches their visually confirmed equipment losses (already over 1,500 tanks, trucks, planes, helicopters, armored vehicles, etc.) This is why Russia is scrambling to reallocate troops from peacekeeping missions, the Far East, and why they're trying to hire tens of thousands of mercenaries. Because they've bitten off more than they can chew.",cc6aa54e200b336cceaaeb7c5ee00fa41a48e048,True,False,,,,,0,1647632834,,0,{},i16zsny,False,t3_th1yuy,False,True,t1_i16cd4n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/th1yuy/ukraine_megathread_march_18/i16zsny/,1647632846,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647604034.0,

Absolutely, this is by far the worst front for Ukraine. They've been getting steadily pushed back and have been outgunned and outnumbered from the start. I have to imagine the Ukrainian units there are in rough shape, and there's the potential still for them to be completely encircled in the coming weeks. Worse than that, if/when they are defeated what forces will Ukraine have to defend Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia and to keep the supply lines from there to the Eastern front open?

&gt;but Ukraine has so far not managed to retake much significant territory, nor have they tried to relieve the forces trapped in Mariupol. I suspect that they know that large scale maneuvers will leave them at the mercy of Russian heavy fires and the RuA

That's exactly right. Ukraine has done this well because they aren't fighting pitched battles in open fields against the much more powerful Russian military. They've been forcing the Russians to attack them in towns and cities and their own prepared positions. Local counterattacks have seen some success, but Ukraine doesn't have the ability to launch major strategic counterattacks currently. Not sure if/when they might be able to. 

Overall Ukraine's best chance is to essentially fight Russia into a stalemate in which they constantly harass Russian units with hit and run tactics, attack supply convoys, drop UAV ordinance on choice targets, etc with the goal of bleeding Russia white. The question is can Ukraine or Russia hold out for longer?

This article presents an analysis of how useful they might actually be. The conclusion is that they only of marginal usefulness, and might mainly be used as ""emotional-support armor"".

Article text:

&gt; Alot of Russian tanks involved in the invasion of Ukraine have strange cages welded over the roofs of their turrets. Strange and apparently useless—for many pictures have emerged of destroyed vehicles surmounted by them. Sometimes the cage itself has been visibly damaged by an attack that went on to hit the tank beneath.

&gt; Stijn Mitzer, an independent analyst based in Amsterdam, has looked at hundreds of verified photographs of destroyed Russian vehicles. He thinks that, far from acting as protection, the cages have done nothing save add weight, make tanks easier to spot, and perhaps give a false and dangerous sense of security to the crew inside. They have thus been mockingly dubbed by some Western analysts as “emotional-support armour” or “cope cages”.

&gt; Superficially, they are an example of what is known in military circles as field-expedient armour—in other words, stuff that has been added to vehicles after they have entered service. Often, field expedients are sensible retrofits. Gareth Appleby-Thomas, head of the Centre for Defence Engineering at Cranfield University, in Britain, observes that they have ranged over the years from sandbags, via sheets of armour subsequently (and often crudely) attached to the outsides of tanks, to factory-made upgrade kits.

&gt;Cage fight

&gt; The new cages, the fitting of which seems to have begun late in 2021, appear to be a variant of so-called slat or bar armour. Such armour can provide effective lightweight protection if used correctly (as it is, for example, on American Stryker armoured personnel carriers). But in this case that seems not to have happened. They might thus be seen as symbols of Russia’s inadequate preparation for the campaign, as pertinent in their way as its failures to neutralise Ukraine’s air defences and to shoot down that country’s drones.

&gt; One of the main threats to armoured vehicles are heat (High Explosive Anti-Tank) weapons, such as the Russian-made but widely employed rpg-7. The warheads of these rocket-propelled grenades are shaped charges—hollow cones of explosive lined with metal. When the explosive detonates it blasts the metal lining into a narrow, high-speed jet that is able to punch through thick steel. According to Dr Appleby-Thomas an rpg-7 can penetrate 30cm of steel plate.

&gt; And rpg-7s are the babies of the bunch. Other, far more powerful shaped-charge anti-tank weapons used by Ukrainian forces include Javelins supplied by America, nlaws (Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapons) supplied by Britain, and drone-borne mam-l missiles, supplied by Turkey.

&gt; heat warheads may be countered by what is known as explosive reactive armour, or era. When this is hit, a sheet of explosive sandwiched inside it blows up and disrupts an incoming warhead before it can detonate. Many Russian tanks are indeed fitted with era. However era may, in turn, be defeated by a so-called tandem warhead, in which a small precursor charge triggers the armour’s explosive before the main warhead detonates.

&gt; Slat and bar add-on armours are a lighter and cheaper way to counter rpgs, though even if used correctly they are, literally, hit or miss protection. The spacing of the bars or slats is crucial. If a rocket hits a bar it makes little difference, for its warhead will detonate anyway. But if it gets trapped between bars it will probably be damaged in a way which means that the signal from the nose-mounted fuse cannot reach the detonator.

&gt; This approach is known as statistical armour, because the protection it offers is all or nothing. It is typically quoted as having a 50% chance of disrupting an incoming rpg. But Dr Appleby-Thomas notes that it works only against munitions with a nose fuse, which Javelins, nlaws and mam-ls do not have.

&gt; Russia has been fitting slat armour to vehicles since 2016, but the design of the new cages, seemingly improvised from locally available materials, is baffling. They appear to be oriented in a way that protects only against attacks from above. In principle, that might help against Javelins, which have a “top attack” mode in which they first veer upwards and then dive to punch through a tank’s thin top armour. But, as Nick Reynolds, a land-warfare research analyst at rusi, a British defence think-tank, notes, even if the cage sets off a Javelin’s precursor warhead, the main charge is still more than powerful enough to punch through the top armour and destroy the tank—as the Ukrainian army itself proved in December, when it tested one against a vehicle protected by add-on armour replicating the Russian design. As expected, the Javelin destroyed the target easily.

&gt; Another idea is that the cages are a response to the conflict in 2020 between Armenia and Azerbaijan, over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which large numbers of Russian-made Armenian tanks were destroyed from above by mam-ls. But Samuel Cranny-Evans, another analyst at rusi, points out that the mam-l’s lack of nose fuse makes adding cages unlikely to succeed. Hitting a cage might detonate the warhead prematurely, but Mr Cranny-Evans does not believe this would prevent it destroying a tank.

&gt; A third possibility is that the cages are meant as protection against rpgs (which the Ukrainians have in abundance) which are being fired at tanks from above. This rarely happens in an open battlefield but is a preferred tactic in urban warfare, where buildings offer shooters the necessary elevation.

&gt;The question “why?”

&gt; Even if that is true, though, it comes at a price. Patrick Benham-Crosswell, a former tank officer in the British Army and author of “The Dangerous World of Tommy Atkins: An Introduction to Land Warfare”, notes the cages limit the ability of the machine-gun mounted on the top of the turret to swing upwards to engage enemies firing down on the vehicle.

&gt; Dr Appleby-Thomas speculates that the cages’ real purpose might therefore be to protect against small, improvised bombs released from drones. Ukraine has developed munitions based on hand-thrown anti-tank grenades, by fitting them with fins so that they can be dropped accurately from commercial drones. These drone-borne bombs might present a real danger in urban areas. But the cages would only blunt such attacks rather than provide complete protection, because they form but a partial screen over the turret, and leave other areas completely exposed.

&gt; The last possibility, then, is that the gibes about the cages being emotional-support armour are actually correct, and that they have been added simply to improve morale by convincing the troops inside that they are safe. As Mr Benham-Crosswell notes, soldiers often take the view that every little helps.

&gt; Believing you are safe is not, however, actually the same as being safe. A pointed historical parallel might be found in the ghost dance shirts, supposed to have had supernatural powers to stop bullets, which were worn by some Lakota warriors in their uprising against the American government in 1889 and 1890. These certainly improved morale. But they didn’t save their wearers at Wounded Knee.",4db1c3d42acc501c842e293dd5d465f51d5d8615,True,False,,,,,0,1647627460,,0,{},i16mlz1,True,t3_thaz7s,False,True,t3_thaz7s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/thaz7s/the_economist_russian_tanks_in_ukraine_are/i16mlz1/,1647627477,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647598660.0,

IMO, the ""coming collapse of China"" narrative is as silly as the one that assumes that China's GDP will be 4-5x larger than that of the U.S. by mid-century. The most likely scenario is that China will stabilize at roughly twice the overall PPP GDP of the U.S.

That sounds about right. CCP has shown that they are not willing to go through the full liberalization route, because it threatens their power. This, combined with bad demographics, will probably stunt their growth for the next few decades. 

South Korea, with a much smaller population and a much more sensible government, is stabilizing at around 60% of US nominal GDP per capita, and 75% of the PPP variant. And unlike South Korea, China is a gargantuan nation with far greater demands on its potential; they need more raw resources, they need more people (i.e. they cannot simply accept immigrants to boost their working age population), and they have a rapidly rising geopolitical profile that necessitates expenditure, in both gold and human effort.

GDP at around 2x the US figure in terms of PPP, and a bit less in nominal terms, seems about right for China. That would certainly make them a challenging adversary, but not impossible to deal with.

Anyway I don't want to belabour the point but there are a few key variables that are blocking a full-scale analysis:   


1. What is the supply status of the Ukrainian Armed forces? I have to imagine that the forces in Kyiv are well supplied. It doesn't look like Russia has been able to interdict much of the supply moving west to east. It's the forces in the south pinned along the JFO that are most concerning. Judging by (anecdotal) evidence, civilians fleeing have had difficulty obtaining fuel but who knows what the Ukrainian armed forces have? 
2. How much damage has the Ukrainian military taken? We have very little knowledge of losses on the Ukrainian side. Surely Russian losses are heavy and their defence has been impressive to say the least, but Ukraine has so far not managed to retake much significant territory, nor have they tried to relieve the forces trapped in Mariupol. I suspect that they know that large scale maneuvers will leave them at the mercy of Russian heavy fires and the RuA, but one can only maintain a dispersed defence for so long. 
3. What are Putin's new operational goals? It's clear that Russia has given up on regime change and now knows that any puppet government will last about 5 seconds after the Russian forces withdraw. We also know that Putin probably doesn't have enough troops to storm Kyiv. I suspect we might see a ceasefire after Mariupol falls just so the Russians can reset and resupply. To be clear: this is *not* a clear-cut Ukrainian victory. A ceasefire may simply just allow Russia time to reorganize, regroup, and then reengage in aggressive maneuvers. 

There are simply too many unknown datapoints. All we know now is the Russians are taking losses. Heavy fighting continues along each of the fronts (I have some Ukrainian relatives in Canada and in Ukraine, all are saying the fighting is extremely intense. Close quarters, hand-to-hand, and with a shocking level of brutality). For this reason it's difficult to classify the advance as ""stalled."" I would more so say the advance has been checked and now each force is engaging the other. 

The negotiating table is ultimately where this war will end.

In effect, Plokhy argues, it was the Soviet system that created Chernobyl and made the explosion inevitable. Glimmers of this understanding appear in the HBO series, too. In the final episode, Legasov, testifying as a witness, tells a Soviet court that the disaster happened because the tips of the control rods were made of graphite, which sped up the reaction, when the control rod was supposed to slow it down. When asked, by the prosecutor, why the reactor was designed this way, Legasov cites the same reason that other safety precautions are ignored and other corners are cut: “It’s cheaper.” He seems to be damning the whole system.

The entire accident is when you think about it extraordinary and that is the link I meant to draw. *The accident happened because the Soviets mismanaged the reactor during a test to see what would happen to the cooling system during a failure during a power loss*.

They should have already known that.

I believe that Putin has a fairly ethnic-centric world view. As a result I would guess that the problem for Russia in his mind is not purely numbers, it’s ethnic. The total population in Russia may not fall off a cliff (although 84 million by 2100 is certainly possible) but the population of ethnic Russians will. 

If you consider Ukrainians to be Russians, annexing Ukraine gets you 40 million Russians and brings the large majority of people Putin considers Russians into the Russian state. Yes the Ukraine population is also shrinking but you are not getting any extra Russian population any other way. Also, the annexation brings the remaining ethnic “Russians” (if viewed as how I believe Putin views it) together, which may be even more important in Putin’s mind given the dwindling numbers.

As has been pointed out, this is essentially Russia’s last chance to do something like this. It also brings in more agriculture and foodstuffs production. Theoretically increasing China and Middle East reliance on Russia and Russia’s influence and control over these countries even if Russia can no lounger support a military influence.

Also casualties are not going to significantly increase the demographics problem because the number of people brought under Russia will be many times higher than those killed and those killed will mostly be men, which are not as important from a purely demographic perspective.

Of course not.

I think that there's a reason that soldiers get trained for the environment they'll be operating in. There's a reason the US army has training bases in the Catskills in New York and sends soldiers there for winter weather acclimatization. 

&gt;As for Ukraine being ""thick deciduous woodlands"", look at this map.

Yes, exactly. A lot of strategic areas are minimum 20% deciduous woodlands, and that will become a haven for insurgents that need rooting out.

Operating in that environment, and in mud, requires training.

&gt;a notional airlift capacity of 15,540 passengers.

And how the fuck are they supposed to buy fuel in Syria when there's no mechanism to process payments thanks to SWIFT being denied them?

So best case scenario they'll spend a long time airlifting troops of unknown capability that need training to operate in a totally different environment than they've been in.

Where even the summers are unusually brutal.

You can't take soldiers from a low-humidity area like Syria and put them into a high-humidity area like Ukraine without significant acclimatization. 

Again, there are massive military bases in central Virginia, which is more brutally humid than Louisiana swamps or Florida, and that's where they send folks from Arizona or California where things are dry.

Soldiers need to be trained and acclimatized to be able to fight in a different ecology than the one they're experienced in, and that process takes months or years.

You can't take people from places like Khanāşir where the maximum humidity is 13% and expect them to fight in conditions of 80% humidity and 35 C temperatures. And that's the sort of area where the Syrian front lines are.

You are placing a false dichotomy. In your mind so long as a state can perform any action, sanctions are useless.

Iran without sanctions would be far richer and have fully refreshed it military. Now it has to fly clapped out F 14s and relies of basically small militias in the world poorest states. 

Sanctions create a pressure to achieve a political goal. Or in the case of non compliant regimes to reduce their capacity to act internationally and even internally.

https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE231.html

Russia has recently carried out substantial reforms to its military forces, increasing capability in several key areas. Russia's military has improved to the extent that it is now a reliable instrument of national power that can be used in a limited context to achieve vital national interests. Russian strategists, concerned about the capability of an advanced military adversary to carry out a large-scale conventional aerospace campaign against the Russian heartland, focus on preserving Russian influence in buffer states along its borders and on reinforcing a series of defensive bulwarks. Russian operations will show a high degree of coordination across a wide range of military units, using deception and simultaneity to achieve objectives quickly and minimize periods of vulnerability to an adversary's most dangerous capabilities. Russian tactics will continue to heavily emphasize gaining and maintaining fire superiority over an adversary; leveraging improved ISR capabilities and a wide range of fires platforms; and using speed, surprise, and integrated combined arms in maneuver forces to disrupt and overwhelm enemies once encountered.

Key Findings
Russia hopes to defend its territory and avoid decisive engagement with a peer or near-peer competitor by fielding defensive systems and strike weapons with extended ranges.
Given Russia's conventional weaknesses in a protracted war with a peer or near-peer adversary, it will attempt to use indirect action strategies and asymmetric responses across multiple domains.
Russia may threaten to employ or employ its nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack that would undermine the regime's control of the state or threaten Russia's nuclear deterrent.
Several Russian operations have involved a rapid, coordinated coup de main attempting to achieve campaign objectives in a very short period of time; this emphasis is likely to remain, especially in pre-planned operations.
Recent reforms have made a substantially larger percentage of the land components of the Russian Armed Forces available at higher readiness for short-notice contingencies, while reducing the total number of units.
On the ground, Russian tactics will likely reflect a heavy emphasis on massed indirect fires (particularly long-range fires), with the effects of these fires exploited by highly mobile vehicles with substantial direct fire capability.
The summary of the discussion. 

&gt; After ten years of military modernization and defense reform, Russia's military is now a reliable instrument of national power that can be used in a limited context to achieve vital national interests. Russian strategists, concerned about instability along the Russian periphery or an aerospace attack on the Russian heartland, are focused on preserving influence in buffer states and on reinforcing defensive bulwarks. Russian military strategy and operations show an increasing degree of coordination, deception, and simultaneity to achieve objectives quickly while minimizing vulnerabilities.

At the start of this week the general consensus seemed to be that the Russian offensive was split three ways (frontal assault on Mykolaiv, skip Mykolaiv and push on Odessa, and north through Krivy Rih with an eye on Zapo).

But things have apparently gone horribly this week. The Odessa landings have been postponed, which is just giving TD time to dig in which does not bode well. The WSJ article on the Voznesensk disaster for the Russians was shocking. And now there is confirmation that the UA is back in Posad-Pokrovske.

First off, this was supposed to be the most successful part of the invasion for Russia, so the fact that they are being turned back is interesting. 

But more importantly, there are two Dniper crossings south of Zapo: on in Kherson and one in Nova Kakhova. If the UA is threatening these crossings with a move on libersting Kherson and the Dniper delta region, it seems to me like the entire Russian offensive up the Dniper north bank is at risk.

I haven't seen any analysis to that effect, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it start to pop up. And I think this has huge knock-on effects for the entire campaign. No north bank campaign means no way to encircle Zapo and Dnipro, which probably means no way to encircle Kharkiv either. Would be a major blow to Russia.

At this point it's pretty clear that NATO would wipe the floor with Russian forces in Ukraine and that would leave nukes as the only option left for him after that, which nobody actually wants. It's more useful to freeze/limit NATO and make them weigh the potential costs (extreme for both sides) of increased involvement in the conflict. Escalating with cyber warfare tips that calculus.

As for why it hasn't been deployed more vs Ukraine, an obvious answer is that NATO has probably been working with Ukraine to develop countermeasures and limiting their effectiveness.

Perhaps Russia isn't using their ""Old stocks"" first. Perhaps corruption runs so deep that they're using whatever they can find that works.

T-14 Armata is the next-gen tank Russia has been trying to push for many years. It *still* has not entered production. Russia will not be using this against Ukraine.

The T-90 is from the 90s and is missing many of the modern features. The T-90A introduced reactive armour. Russia Operates 369 T-90A tanks. **On paper.**

So now the invasion is struggling, where are these tanks?

Personally, I think many are out of service. I think many never got made due to corruption. And I think Russia is sending all that they've got, while keeping a reserve in major cities and bases in case of invasion or escalation.

I could analyse air units, however if Russia had working aircraft, **they would've already used them to disable air defence in Ukraine.** They're showing that they either don't have the aircraft or the tact to disable air defence effectively. Both are a sign that Russia's military is weak.

I keep seeing people suggest that ""they're saving their best units"", but I think that realistically Russia is just much weaker than they thought. Russia is just too corrupt, and too poor of a country. They're not a world power. They're a big country, by land mass, with a big mouth.

The other commenter in this thread provides a good explanation of this in terms of the materiel Russia has been observed using in Ukraine. And in my view, it's also best evidenced by the fact that, far from setting itself up for a protracted war of attrition, Russia's strategy from day one was clearly designed with a quick, overwhelming victory in mind. Russia thought it would be able to win by *fait accompli,* seizing Kyiv and decapitating the Ukrainian government before Ukraine and NATO would have much chance to mount a serious political, economic, and military resistance.

As the war pushes into week four, and the political, economic, and military premises of Russia's success in the war seem to melt away more by the day, there's been a lot of continued effort by Russia and its apologists to rewrite the narrative and say ""No, no.

It leaves autocratic regimes prone to making catastrophic, short-sighted mistakes, and it's a bad environment in which to plan a brazen geopolitical move like this, in large part because information that could indicate what a bad idea it is ends up absent from the conversation.

\&gt;on the basis of faulty intelligence

This mostly comes down to a gross misunderstanding by Russia of the willingness and capability of Ukraine's military, people, and political leadership to resist an invasion and fight an effective war on the ground and in the air. The signs that an invasion wouldn't be Russia's envisioned cakewalk *fait accompli* were always there for them to see from open sources, let alone what their intelligence services should have been able to glean (Russian-backed separatists describing how much Ukraine's force has transformed since the war began in 2014, the Ukrainian military being advised and supplied by NATO, Ukrainian civilians turning out in droves for weekend trainings on how to wage an insurgency, etc.). 

\&gt;a poor understanding of the global political context of the situation

Russia seemed to believe that NATO countries would be too disjointed and ineffectual within and among themselves to mount a serious resistance to the invasion in the political and economic sphere, especially if they were able to win quickly. This proved to be incredibly untrue, as NATO was largely united on the issue and able to begin levying sanctions and ramping up lethal military aid to Ukraine basically from day one. The success of interstate conflicts are deeply intertwined with their international political context, and Russia has a serious and worsening political problem here.

\&gt;an inflated concept of the real-world capabilities of the Russian military.

A supposedly mighty air force largely MIA and unable to achieve air superiority? Low morale conscripts punching holes in their vehicles' gas tanks and surrendering en masse? Elite Spetsnaz soldiers raiding supermarkets for food? Supply convoys stuck in miles of traffic because their tires are too poorly maintained to drive off road in the mud?

[],False,,TheFreeloader,,,[],,,,text,t2_6kimw,False,False,"&gt; Alot of Russian tanks involved in the invasion of Ukraine have strange cages welded over the roofs of their turrets. Strange and apparently useless—for many pictures have emerged of destroyed vehicles surmounted by them. Sometimes the cage itself has been visibly damaged by an attack that went on to hit the tank beneath.

&gt; Stijn Mitzer, an independent analyst based in Amsterdam, has looked at hundreds of verified photographs of destroyed Russian vehicles. He thinks that, far from acting as protection, the cages have done nothing save add weight, make tanks easier to spot, and perhaps give a false and dangerous sense of security to the crew inside. They have thus been mockingly dubbed by some Western analysts as “emotional-support armour” or “cope cages”.

&gt; Superficially, they are an example of what is known in military circles as field-expedient armour—in other words, stuff that has been added to vehicles after they have entered service. Often, field expedients are sensible retrofits. Gareth Appleby-Thomas, head of the Centre for Defence Engineering at Cranfield University, in Britain, observes that they have ranged over the years from sandbags, via sheets of armour subsequently (and often crudely) attached to the outsides of tanks, to factory-made upgrade kits.

&gt;Cage fight

&gt; The new cages, the fitting of which seems to have begun late in 2021, appear to be a variant of so-called slat or bar armour. Such armour can provide effective lightweight protection if used correctly (as it is, for example, on American Stryker armoured personnel carriers). But in this case that seems not to have happened. They might thus be seen as symbols of Russia’s inadequate preparation for the campaign, as pertinent in their way as its failures to neutralise Ukraine’s air defences and to shoot down that country’s drones.

&gt; One of the main threats to armoured vehicles are heat (High Explosive Anti-Tank) weapons, such as the Russian-made but widely employed rpg-7. The warheads of these rocket-propelled grenades are shaped charges—hollow cones of explosive lined with metal. When the explosive detonates it blasts the metal lining into a narrow, high-speed jet that is able to punch through thick steel. According to Dr Appleby-Thomas an rpg-7 can penetrate 30cm of steel plate.

&gt; And rpg-7s are the babies of the bunch. Other, far more powerful shaped-charge anti-tank weapons used by Ukrainian forces include Javelins supplied by America, nlaws (Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapons) supplied by Britain, and drone-borne mam-l missiles, supplied by Turkey.

&gt; heat warheads may be countered by what is known as explosive reactive armour, or era. When this is hit, a sheet of explosive sandwiched inside it blows up and disrupts an incoming warhead before it can detonate. Many Russian tanks are indeed fitted with era. However era may, in turn, be defeated by a so-called tandem warhead, in which a small precursor charge triggers the armour’s explosive before the main warhead detonates.

&gt; Slat and bar add-on armours are a lighter and cheaper way to counter rpgs, though even if used correctly they are, literally, hit or miss protection. The spacing of the bars or slats is crucial. If a rocket hits a bar it makes little difference, for its warhead will detonate anyway. But if it gets trapped between bars it will probably be damaged in a way which means that the signal from the nose-mounted fuse cannot reach the detonator.

&gt; This approach is known as statistical armour, because the protection it offers is all or nothing. It is typically quoted as having a 50% chance of disrupting an incoming rpg. But Dr Appleby-Thomas notes that it works only against munitions with a nose fuse, which Javelins, nlaws and mam-ls do not have.

&gt; Russia has been fitting slat armour to vehicles since 2016, but the design of the new cages, seemingly improvised from locally available materials, is baffling. They appear to be oriented in a way that protects only against attacks from above. In principle, that might help against Javelins, which have a “top attack” mode in which they first veer upwards and then dive to punch through a tank’s thin top armour. But, as Nick Reynolds, a land-warfare research analyst at rusi, a British defence think-tank, notes, even if the cage sets off a Javelin’s precursor warhead, the main charge is still more than powerful enough to punch through the top armour and destroy the tank—as the Ukrainian army itself proved in December, when it tested one against a vehicle protected by add-on armour replicating the Russian design. As expected, the Javelin destroyed the target easily.

&gt; Another idea is that the cages are a response to the conflict in 2020 between Armenia and Azerbaijan, over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which large numbers of Russian-made Armenian tanks were destroyed from above by mam-ls. But Samuel Cranny-Evans, another analyst at rusi, points out that the mam-l’s lack of nose fuse makes adding cages unlikely to succeed. Hitting a cage might detonate the warhead prematurely, but Mr Cranny-Evans does not believe this would prevent it destroying a tank.

&gt; A third possibility is that the cages are meant as protection against rpgs (which the Ukrainians have in abundance) which are being fired at tanks from above. This rarely happens in an open battlefield but is a preferred tactic in urban warfare, where buildings offer shooters the necessary elevation.

&gt;The question “why?”

&gt; Even if that is true, though, it comes at a price. Patrick Benham-Crosswell, a former tank officer in the British Army and author of “The Dangerous World of Tommy Atkins: An Introduction to Land Warfare”, notes the cages limit the ability of the machine-gun mounted on the top of the turret to swing upwards to engage enemies firing down on the vehicle.

&gt; Dr Appleby-Thomas speculates that the cages’ real purpose might therefore be to protect against small, improvised bombs released from drones. Ukraine has developed munitions based on hand-thrown anti-tank grenades, by fitting them with fins so that they can be dropped accurately from commercial drones. These drone-borne bombs might present a real danger in urban areas. But the cages would only blunt such attacks rather than provide complete protection, because they form but a partial screen over the turret, and leave other areas completely exposed.

&gt; The last possibility, then, is that the gibes about the cages being emotional-support armour are actually correct, and that they have been added simply to improve morale by convincing the troops inside that they are safe. As Mr Benham-Crosswell notes, soldiers often take the view that every little helps.

&gt; Believing you are safe is not, however, actually the same as being safe. A pointed historical parallel might be found in the ghost dance shirts, supposed to have had supernatural powers to stop bullets, which were worn by some Lakota warriors in their uprising against the American government in 1889 and 1890.

Russia faces /decades/ of reparations as an attempt to prefer the bear teeth are not growing back.  It will certainly destroy Putin and likely implode the country with 'mediated reentry' to world trade.  Not including anything which could be dual-use applied to reequipment.  
At some point down the road, they will lose everything as Ukraine tears up the paper and invites full Western 'friendly occupation' by NATO forces and Russia, broke and rudderless, can only watch as their position as prime energy source supplier is take over by the very people whose invasion they are being punished for attempting to prevent their own displacement.  
Why would Putin choose to give up now, when in likely under a year, sans &lt;10nm custom chips he will not have a working military at all?  
\&gt;&gt;  
Russian soldiers were going around asking civilians for food and gas at the START of the conflict, looting stores for food, they aren't exactly in a great place themselves when it comes to supplies.  
\&gt;&gt;  
First off, the simplest of techniques would have cut off and gutted the Ukrainian defenses at point of contact.  How they managed to get behind the Russians or to deploy '17,000' Javelins (when only 45,000 have been built, since 2000 or so and probably half of those expended in SWA or training) when their own road nets are cut makes zero sense.  
Until you realize that this bears the hallmarks of CAG/CAD type work.  Operating with contract USOF, using all the best Western Tech to drive out of cities where they are 'safe in a crowd' and use overhead to preposition themselves on routes which have been land-nav'd with military competence as GPS and more (UAV GMTI) updates of roving Russian FSE security teams.  
Because you see it's not the trigger pull that matters.  It's the getting in and especially out, without getting run down and stomped in the transit.  And once you start to figure high end UCW tactics, backed up by Western Milspec technology chase, you begin to understand why and how this has gone wrong.  
Because it's not a  bunch of Ukrainian Hill Billy's.  It's Unacknowledged Special Operations Forces.  
And yet, whatever monkey wrench they flung in the Russian gears, the engine of the Russian War machine didn't go wrong enough.  And now that Putin is settled in on a more limited, fixed, positional reference and can set up Krepna-U and similar GMTI of his own; continued Snake Eater attacks, even with 10km V-600 Switchblades instead of 4km Javelins, will become less and less effective.  
As he quickly pulls out logistics elements and shifts them around by external rail traffic, to begin pumping his forward units with field depots and overall more frequent supplies/replacements, during the ops pause.  
While his airpower takes over.  They use ARMs to Kh-31 Kryptonite any remaining RF emitters.  And then just hoses down the cities until there is nothing left to defend.  
At which point, it will be \_The West's\_ fault for sending in penny packets of operators and ATGW, sufficient to prolong the battle, without leaving the Russians able to rapidly end it, and thus rapidly increasing the costs, to all sides and particularly the civilians.  
Such is why Zelensky still sounds ever more desperate, even though he /says/ the war is won.  
At which point we're right back to my opening question.  How do we finish the fight before WE are the ones humiliated or roasted, for attacking Russian targets on Russian soil to prevent them from enacting a Mazcat which we forced on them by so badly attriting their operational units that they cannot do anything -except- the mass bombardment approach?  
'Sanctions' didn't work, after Nanking became the path to Pearl Harbor.  'Sanctions' didn't work, after 1938 and the second WJC declaration of war as the Germans took their industry on a roadshow and began trading machine tools and consumer goods in South America, for food and raw materials, on a barter basis, because the Reichsmark was frozen.  
What //did work//, in starting a war which killed 60-100 million, was telling Poland to constantly pick a fight with Germany over Danzig, and then leaving them, swinging in the wind, as the Germans took them up on it and Britain and France turned their backs and let the rape of Warsaw happen with 40,000 dead as 140,000 Polish soldiers fought like demons to keep the Capital free.  The Russians were there, full partners to the Axis advance.  They could tell you what happened.  
Except today, the Russians are in their own SOI.  Today they have subkiloton nukes on essentially unstoppable TBM.  Today, the Russians read history to avoid being it's victims, again.  And today, the Russians know that not in 1939, not in 1956, not in 1967 and not in 1984, did the U.S. ever once stick their toe in that Eastern European tactical nuke minefield to advanced armor in support of a 'greater ideal' than simple survival.  
I asked you 'How?' because the answer is obviously 'not gonna try'.  
Now I ask you the followup: 'Do the Ukrainians not read history?'  
If this is all just impotent elite stage drama, masquerading behind their self aggrandizing media wags and Putin in fact never intends to leave, what's the Ukrainian takeaway?  
What's their way out?  
Because the Zelensky government is going to have to fall, for the Putin one to remain in power.  And Putin has the means to assure this, just like Starzynski got his come uppance, at the hands of the Heer.  
But only if Putin wins this fight.  The chance will never again come to him, if he evacuates his forces from the theater.  It's just a long slow L for Russia, from here.  
So again, I ask, if our Media are flat out lying through their teeth to us, as usual, and the actual position is that the U.S. cannot, dares not, intervene and NATO is too weak to try, what mollifies Zelensky.  Or do his JSOC handlers simply take him into a dark room and put four in the back of his head like the SS did with the Commissar of Warsaw before announcing he died bravely in a bombing attack?",c83f60c47aebb6bc37baf3dabe02cc4c8535e9b1,True,False,,,,,0,1647615257,,0,{},i15rerb,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i15rcsm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i15rerb/,1647615270,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647586457.0,

If Russia does not feed starving civilians, not only will it stiffen Ukrainian resolve, but it will also increase the chances of international intervention, whether that comes in the form of national or organizational form.  
\&gt;&gt;

How?  Does the U.S. drive three HBCTs across the border after spending a month moving them?  Does it advance in the face of Iskander with nuclear tips while using trailer drawn PAC-3 and THAAD that take anything up to two hours to rig?

Does it threaten those TBM with stealths and cruise missiles?  And does this not simply force the Russians to use Kh-102 from Tu-95/160 coming from the depths of the Russian East?

You do understand that NATO's rapid reaction force has nothing like a divisional element logistics train to push a single front forwards with NO flanking security.  And that, sans a major air war, on Russian/Belarus territory, we cannot do to their logistics/MSR what they can do to ours, while locked to the primary rail axes, out of Lutsk and Lviv?

There is no POMCUS.  The Marine heavy depot unit in Norway is too far away and would itself be subject to Barent's Sea attacks from Kalibr equipped subs and ships is they DID try to bring something south to GDansk or the like.

First you have to get your units to a railhead, somewhere around Zhytomyr or Cherkasy.  And you will be subject to annihilation by either nuclear or conventional warhead strikes as soon as you cross a bridge or rail viaduct.  Just like that Serbian civilian train which was blown to bits when a U.S. F-15E dropped an AGM-130 in front of it, back in the 90s.

Only this time, there will be 3-5 billion dollars worth of hardware in movement.  And this \_does not change\_, even if you try to drive it as the Rasputitsya takes charge of everything.

Russians can have the stiffest lip imaginable but if their civilians die, they still lose.

\&gt;&gt;  
Besides, if we use your analogy, the besieging force usually faces similar starvation as the besieged, they are far from home at the end of a long, contested supply chain.   
\&gt;&gt;

Like Rome at Alesia?  Like England where Churchill //begged// Chaim Weizmann to get America into the war before the U-Boats strangled his country?  Like Moscow, where, a month before U.S. food shipments began arriving, the entire population of pets disappeared?  Or like Leningrad, when 'knock knock' brigades went about town, checking on the old, weak and slow and taking those too far gone to defend themselves to a quick knife slash and a place in the 'Russian Meatlocker' snow bank?

 Civilians will grow desperate, and begin doing dumb things, long before the military does.  And just like Hitler /should have done/, now that Russian Army forces are reaching their fixed operational limits/objectives, they can begin to stockpile.

Not least because I would bet more than half the Russian generals who planned this insanity are now dead or in prison.  And the ones who aren't.  Will be the clever ones which FSB files show as being the most talented, innovative and hardwilled.  Not a Zhukov but a Rokossovskii.

Ukraine had a paper deal.  It was called the 1994 Budapest Agreement and it \_promised\_ that both the USA and Russia would protect Ukraine from all threats, foreign and domestic, if she ever got into trouble.  And all she had to do was sign away her rights to a sovereign defense.

Ended up not being worth the paper it was written on.

Why would Russia, who abrogated that treaty, believe she would be protected by any subsequent piece of paper?  Especially when the elites of the U.S. have literally committed treason to protect their energy investments in the Ukraine by forcible destroying U.S. developed oil and gas independence?

Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment groups has literally dumped all her American energy investments.  And the Donbass and Crimea sit right on the gas deposits which could make Ukraine rich.

What bothers me is the dead silence over how weak Ukraine must be.  Everyone makes all these 'Russia can't win, they have lost ten percent of their armor and 20-30% of their trucks!' promises but there is absolutely no estimate of Ukrainian SA-8 and SA-10 and SA-11 remaining.  Why not?

Ukraine says they will gladly take 28 Polish MiG-29s which were downgrade 9.12B variants when they were /new/, back in the 1980s.  Purpose built to be decisively topped out by Russian Su-27s, never mind Su-30/35.

But what does it say that they had 37 of these Fulcrums, useless as they are, in 2020.  That they had 32 Su-27s.  Where are those.  That this addition will 'tip the scales' with a dated, SARH/shortburn BVR platform with single target track and 10-12nm realistic F-Pole capability.  Against Russian ER systems which are capable of anywhere from 18-20nm realistic launches and impact at the time the Ukrainian systems are just opening fire with an illuminate-to-impact weapon?

What about the at least one SA-20/21 battery which is now parked within 20nm of Kyiv and supposedly put a cap in the Ukrainian's top fighter ace?

How are Polish MiG-29s going to improve the performance of existing Ukrainian systems unless the reality is actually that Russian aircraft and missiles have completely annihilated the Ukrainian air force and 'some is better than naked'?

Russian Frontal AD and certainly Man Portables are just as dense and probably technically better than aged out FIM-92s and a few coldwar Gecko/Gopher/Gauntlet.

It's almost like this is a mass deception plan to cover for a monumental /Western Blunder/ which has seen Ukraine's armed forces left with nothing.  As Russians, who own the road ways, settle into siege positions and prepare to slowly destroy food/water/electricity/television/internet.

So that the endgame of Ukraine is to drown in the silence of their own blood.

Our mass propaganda corps is capable of just such an action.

And if what I say is even fractionally true, 'running out of missiles' means nothing.  Because Russia just needs sufficient clear weather to begin medium/high altitude bombardment with SVP-24 as GNSS/ARBS and they can quickly destroy the Ukrainian civil infrastructure.

The US has actually taken a huge chunk out of non-governmental Russian hackers since Biden got in office. They've been smashing the fuck out of anyone who isn't a state actor. 

That's to put the Russians on notice that the US does have cyber weapons it will immediately deploy against Russia if Russia moves against the US or a NATO ally.

So both sides are cautious. Ultimately, Russia has poorer cyber infrastructure and capabilities than the United States. They just don't have the money to build the equipment like the US does.

Russia fears that the US would depower Russian infrastructure and basically shut down their electrical grid. The US fears similar disruption from capabilities or tools that haven't been spotted.

So both sides are being very cautious right now.

It was set up after independence to provide education and employment opportunities for historically underprivileged people, but over time has expanded to include many more groups (with inclusion of said groups sometimes being a campaign promise to secure their votes) to the point that votes are cast along caste lines to secure/maintain reservation privileges, even if the original intent for them has been fulfilled.

The second point about populists, the reality on the ground is complicated. While a large part of Modi's core voter base consists of those who see religion as a primary issue, it also includes many from the poorest sections of society, who have seen utilities and amenities provided to them over the past several years under the Modi government. What I mean to say is, being a populist and addressing inequality are not necessarily separate things.

Point 1, that was true before the war. With the ruble dropping in price the costs are much higher.  


Point 2, you put too much confidence in their calculations. Occam's razor my friend. Seems much more likely that they miscalculated. You really think they went in knowing they'd lose more people and equipment in 3 weeks, just 200 miles from their border, than the US did in 20 years in Iraq/Afghanistan?

4, again, what makes you think it'll be soon? Its taken them this long just to go this far, at this rate it'll be weeks before their forces can meet up, if not months, or never.  


5, no they really aren't. They have a few test copies of their next gen vehicles and planes, but no real manufacturing en masse yet, and with sanctions those programs will come to a halt.

If not, why not a National Militia ship?  Sometimes it's Merchant Marine.  Sometimes it's not.

Subs cost an insane amount of money, both to build and maintain, they are very slow, have the equivalent of biplane level depth performance and require skilled crews whose entire mission is oriented around serving the missile forest in the turtleback.  All for what amounts to maybe 20-30 cruises in a given 25 year lifetime.

Especially now that global transport capacity is massively hit and ships are getting smaller and smaller again, how many ordinary containerships does the equivalent 5 billion dollars worth of  SSBN cost buy?

If you make it a 15 billion dollar carrier instead, how many conventional shots can you load in your Arsenal Ship on the basis of 'one good salvo' of expendable warship vs. a hull with a 50 year life expectancy in peace and a 50hr one in wartime?

Consider what happens if you get under a rainstorm and launch a DF-17 from somewhere off the coast of South America pushing it north, below the Bright Eyes/DSP threshold and between the BMEWS scan arcs to drop on Offut or Peterson or whatever the three replacement command centers are, in the midwest?

What if you DT the missile from just off the coast, while tied up to an offload station with your tanker or product carrier?  Can you hit the boomer piers at Bangor/Kitsap from off San Diego?

Also, what if the point is to do subkiloton or low kiloton ER exchanges to effectively dehouse rather than destroy deep rear area industry and push populations into massive migratory 'refugee mode'.

We know the elites think there are too many of us.  Club Of Rome and CFR, have both published papers on it.

We know that killing off a bunch of people would be a just so convenient alternative to having to explain why there is no money to pay for a bankrupt social welfare system and fighting constantly over rapidly depleting resources.

Is it time to rethink the possibility of precision strike nuclear warfare as a form of either hostaging 'valuable' populations (Silicon Valley anyone?) or exploiting /residual/ low function populations as a starving mass, civil war, internal threats?

You can still have sufficient game enders if you want them to ELE.  But what does the post 500 million man Chinese population look like as a trade-of-favors?

Right now, nuclear weapons are a guarantee of staticism.  But what if ruling autocracies simply 'made a promise' (in their own interests) that they would not be?

Something like:  ""Launch more than 50 missiles of .5kt IFF registered coding and we will go full banana response on you.  Launch fewer than 20 and we will intercept 50% and respond in kind.  Launch 10 and we will leave it to THAAD/ERINT and random chance to decide.  Here is a list of targets we would like house-cleaned...""

Have you ever wondered why suddenly WDC is no longer afraid of nuclear exchanges when Russian subs have never been quieter Putin has explicitly made it clear that he will go full retaliatory if NATO interferes?

* Vehicle and personnel loss have a cost attributed to them; eg a t90 costs 1.5mil usd and Russia values human life at 2mil. Meanwhile, every day that the war operates costs 200mil. This means you can (and should) take risks and losses if it means you can end the war sooner. 

* Russia is pushing up vehicles without knowing where the enemy is hiding. They have calculated that even though they lose X% of lives, it will be worth it to push up to strategic positions. For instance, Mariupol is now surrounded. Most of the losses have occurred the first two weeks in their push.

* War progress should not be calculated in “territory gained” but “population gained”, and Russia is about to have control over 30% of the populated of Ukraine, because so many densely populated areas are on the northeast, east, and south.

* They were and are fighting with split forces; forces will soon be able to unite and fight together.

* Russia is continually building “next-gen” vehicles (as are all countries) so losing old tanks is really not the end of the world.

They have close to 15k main battle tanks. Most in reserve. Many are old and probably in bad condition, but I don't think Russia really cares so long as someone drives them and they shoot-ish. They can probably get most of what they need to recondition them from China or within their borders. 

They have deployed roughly 1.5k mbt tanks in Ukraine. That means they can deploy close to 5-10x more tanks before they run into tank supply problems.

It's the same across the board with their weapons. Aks, rpgs, or artillery.

And the consumables are basically food, fuel to and ammunition. All of which Russia has been making a lot of for a long time. 

But people is a major problem. Russia basically started with all of their main fighting force they could deploy. So to get more soldiers, they have to start dipping into undesirable soldier reserves. That means bad soldiers and more casualties.

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; Here's my breakdown:

I don't disagree with your breakdown. I assumed you were doing it along those lines, and I would break the numbers down similarly. What I was objecting to was the idea of merely saying that every modern tank was the same as every modern tank, and every old tank is the same as every old tank. 

The M60A3 SLEP and the M1A2 SEPv3 are both modern tanks, but we can both agree that there is a large gulf in quality between those two tanks. In just the same way, we can say that the Russian and Ukrainian losses have both been about 50% ""modern"" tanks, but there is a difference in quality between a T-64BV and a T-90A.

I also think there's something that we've rather unfairly forgotten in this entire discussion: **Ukraine's defense doctrine had to be prepared well in advance of knowing the size of a potential invasion force.** We have the benefit of being able to say, ""Well, the Russians are only fielding 117 BTGs and that means that there is a rough equivalency in the number of MBTs."" The defense planning that has taken place over the last eight years hasn't had the benefit of knowing that. All that Ukrainian planners would know over the course of the last several years is that Russian forces might potentially vastly outnumber them. Any defense plan would have been structured around an understanding of conventional Russian doctrine, and would have reasonably expected the Russians to field their top tier equipment in overwhelming numbers on the attack, with Rosvgardia and second-tier equipment only being used to occupy and hold territory.

&gt; Do you mean infantry mortars?

No, I mean ground attack and missile forces. Russia has made limited use of SRBMs and ground attack aircraft in this conflict, but if they had proven to be even moderately competent at conducting SEAD operations, they would have been able to conduct those attacks at an order of magnitude greater in scale.

&gt; In theory. In practice, Russia appears to have a limited supply of PGMs and doesn't do CAS missions. At ~200 VKS sorties a day, the average Ukrainian soldier must rarely notices the presence of Russian fixed-wing assets.

I recognize the difference between theory and practice, and I readily acknowledge that VKS has been a total disaster in this invasion. That being said, no one really believed that the Russians wouldn't have secured air supremacy at this stage in a full-scale invasion. The Ukrainians had to construct their defense strategy around reasonable estimations of Russia's capabilities, not on a desperate hope that it would degenerate into a total clownshow. Remember that we are debating the validity of a strategy that prioritizes urban defense, in acknowledgement of an expected overmatch in almost every other capability.

&gt; They're sub-brigade/regimental combined arms units, with up to 900 men instead of 400-600.

Yes. Exactly what I said. They have the combat power of approximately 1.5 to 2 conventional battalions. Whereas a conventional motorized rifle battalion only has about 30 IFVs, a BTG is templated to be about 10 MBTs, 40 IFVs, fires, and additional support. On paper, that's easily two battalions worth of combat power. In reality, because BTG TO&amp;E isn't strictly defined and because of routine maintenance issues, it's likely to lie closer to one-and-a-half battalions worth of combat power (8-9 MBTs, 30-36 IFVs, fires, and support).

&gt; But just because those assets aren't organic to the battalions doesn't mean they're not there

I'm not comparing their sustainment capabilities. I am comparing their maneuver assets. Even nominally, a BTG has a full tank company and motorized rifle company in addition to a normal motorized rifle battalion.

Beyond all that and going back to the point I make above, Ukraine had no way of knowing what the numbers were going to be. The defense strategy they craft and execute wasn't composed over the course of just the last 3-4 months of buildup. It was prepared over the course of the last eight years, and the Ukrainians would have been right to anticipate that Russia would throw far more armored assets and personnel at Ukraine than they did.",6bcc460d1b1e0aeb1a50de15d67a94d45f16c858,True,False,,,,,0,1647587023,,0,{},i14iopm,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i143nh5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i14iopm/,1647587039,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647558223.0,

Despite the aggressive rhetoric, Russia currently has almost no capability to successfully interdict supplies coming into Ukraine through its western border with Poland. So far, the Russian Air Force has shown almost no ability to find, identify, and destroy mobile targets. The fact that the mobile S-300 SAM systems are still operating is a powerful indictment of Russia’s ability to conduct dynamic or time-sensitive targeting. Additionally, attacks in the far west of Ukraine appear to be missile as opposed to air strikes. It is unlikely that the Russian Air Force would be able to hit supply convoys by air attack, and missiles fired from hundreds of miles away would not be able to hit mobile targets. Thus, Russia has almost no ability to prevent mobile resupply.

Is this really true? Does Russia simply not have the capability to hit these supply convoys?

&gt;The following article was submitted by the author to the Chinese-language edition of the US-China Perception Monitor.

Note this piece was allegedly seeded by Hu Wei directly to Carter Center right before Sullivan &amp; Yang meeting, while US was also front loading other narrative bombshells like alleged RU asking PRC for weapons / support. There's hard ongoing US/West media push trying to shake PRC out of neutrality, but PRC not budging, would not be surprised is this is just part of the pressure campaign. Charhar is ""independent"" / unofficial think tank, i.e. they're less useful than globaltimes in terms of seeding messages for PRC. They also have reputation for leaning pro-west. That said, Carter's PRC program is one of the first since relations opened up (because Carter). There's history - if I were to guess, there's higher chance this is Carter eliciting pro-West voices than PRC trying to signal, supported by the fact the piece has been censored and USCPM has now been blocked. PRC burning bridges to not endorse this.

The piece is getting the kind of magnification among western blobs and media like other ""China's Chernobyl"" tier analysis. Like essays by Ren Zhiqiang / Cai Xia, former got purged, latter had to escape to west and now works for lol Hudson Institute with Pompeo copypasting neolib positions. By all accounts, I think most PRC decision makers have hardened their stance that US after Trump/Biden is systematically incapable of being soft on PRC again. There's no hope for rapprochement. Hu's analysis that turns every dice roll wildly pro-west certainly won't reach politburo and if it did, his concluding line will certainly elicit a chuckle:

&gt;As a result, China will surely win widespread international praise for maintaining world peace, which may help China prevent isolation but also find an opportunity to improve its relations with the United States and the West.

Believing PRC should (and can) improve relations with US is medically retarded at this point. Let alone ""surely win international praise"". And to do so freely without any concessions in return knowing full well a contained RU means PRC is next on the chopping block. If US/West want PRC's help, start by lifting tariffs, removing sanctions, selling EUV machines, stop arming TW. The fact that US has continued multiple high level reassurances to TW (DDG through strait, visits by ex state, Repubs pushing through TW bill), EU still jerks loudly about IndoPac, while negotiating with likes of Venezuela and Iran signals there's no desire for reproachment with PRC. While currently PRC has no interest picking sides, and if it had to, it would pick turning east Europe into a prolonged quagmire behind the scenes because EU foreign policy was shifting anti PRC pre UKR anyway. If UKR is the start of a ""world [that] is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century"", PRC would opt for changes that makes LIO weaker not stronger.",f06948984e22c0bc6546f956011873ddf39f8a88,True,False,,,,,0,1647582707,,0,{},i14d5ku,False,t3_tfz32g,False,True,t3_tfz32g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfz32g/possible_outcomes_of_the_russoukrainian_war_and/i14d5ku/,1647582721,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647553907.0,

Beyond the equipment and personnel loss, it's also a significant propaganda/morale loss and makes Russian equipment look weak which may harm their export potential. How else do you explain their insane decision here if they have significantly more than 90 smart bombs?

Realistically speaking, if they fuck up and trigger a war with NATO, their one and only hope is to escalate it to a nuclear conflict and maybe get NATO to back down. So, the smart bombs are completely useless against NATO, except for the possibility of a handful of smart bombs with tactical nuclear warheads being deployed by Su-57s. There's no one else they'd need to save them for.

As for Ukraine, the only other purposes they might have for smart bombs would be for bunker busters for any new munition depots they happen to learn about. That's it - any extras beyond that can be used for the same bombing purposes as unguided bombs, though with the added benefit of greatly improved safety.

So, considering bunker busters for Ukraine and tactical nuclear warheads for NATO: do they really need more than 90 of them? If so, for what other purpose(s)? If not, then why not use up the excess so they can keep their pilots and aircraft out of harm's way?

&gt;Still, Russia has adopted the so-called Grozny tactics of indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and near-complete razing of cities

**MANPOWER**

This is an article done by the National University of Defense in DC [about the Grozny Campaign.](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA394517.pdf)

&gt;Since the battle for a city continues non-stop, the Russians learned that they needed fresh troops and adequate reserves. Soviet doctrine called for a 4:1 advantage in troops for urban combat. Some 60,000 Russians and 12,000 Chechens fought in Grozny, yet the Russian's 5:1 advantage was sometimes not enough, because they had to guard every building that they took.

This gives an illustration of the number of troops required. Grozny's population was 200,000 in 1994. The ratios of men required didn't change in the second battle of Grozny in 2000.   There are 33 cities in Ukraine that have a larger population than Grozny. Ukraine itself is 2.8 Million.

**ROCKET ARTILLERY**

I haven't counted how much artillery the Russians have, but according to this War of the Rocks article about Russian Logistics we can get a rough estimate of their rocket launchers

[FEEDING THE BEAR: A CLOSER LOOK AT RUSSIAN ARMY LOGISTICS AND THE FAIT ACCOMPLI](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/)

&gt;Although each army is different, there are usually 56 to 90 multiple launch rocket system launchers in an army. Replenishing each launcher takes up the entire bed of the truck. If the combined arms army fired a single volley, it would require 56 to 90 trucks just to replenish rocket ammunition. That is about a half of a dry cargo truck force in the material-technical support brigade just to replace one volley of rockets. There is also between six to nine tube artillery battalions, nine air defense artillery battalions, 12 mechanized and recon battalions, three to five tank battalions, mortars, anti-tank missiles, and small arms ammunition — not to mention, food, engineering, medical supplies, and so on. Those requirements are harder to estimate, but the potential resupply requirements are substantial. The Russian army force needs a lot of trucks just for ammunition and dry cargo replenishment.

There are ten of these combined arms armies assigned to Ukraine which is about 560-900 rocket systems. It is a pin prick, to be honest.  If you look at the videos of grad launches

Of course, this is very rough, but there aren't that many grad videos now compared to 2-3 weeks ago, and the ones they show there are far fewer salvos. I think in 2 weeks they will be out of rockets, and they will have to depend entirely on artillery, which means they are more susceptible to Ukrainian counter batteries and drones.

**RUSSIAN MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX**

The article they mention this

&gt;This suggests that Russia has not fully mobilized its military-industrial complex to support an extended campaign. As the war drags on, we expect Russia will kick its materiel and personnel resupply systems into a higher gear to sustain its forces.

It's not something you can crank out in 2 to 3 months, that is why the Russian are using their old stocks first.  Putin isn't the type of person who is a planner. IF he was he wouldn't have launched this invasion in the first place.

**GENERAL OPINION**

I am not a military expert by far, but the Russian military at the moment is devolving into a WW2 military, without the mass the Soviets had in WW2. 

* Communications - Analog and unencrypted.
* Little air power
* Little combined arms
* Dependent on artillery

People just spout historical examples like Grozny without factoring in the scale and enormity of what is ahead for the Russian military.",4721c084e5af7a1032058e97a1b2ec720adc2d87,True,False,,,,,0,1647580225,,0,{},i149l42,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t3_tgpqvu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i149l42/,1647580242,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647551425.0,

The only way for the US to prevent this is horizontal proliferation to its allies; rather than keep US allies defenseless, the US must spread out its stockpiled nuclear arsenal among its allies (Japan, Taiwan, Australia) and put more fingers on more nuclear triggers.

Chinese thinking is that the US is unwilling to engage in a nuclear war against a nuclear peer, and China can wage war against American allies with impunity so long as they can deter the US from launching a nuclear strike against China. The CCP has previously stated that any attempt by Taiwan to acquire nuclear weapons would be cause for an immediate ""reunification""/ invasion, because if Taiwan were to possess nukes, China would be unable to do so without prohibitive consequences.

If you are referring to the Indian Armed Forces, I am quite sure about the appropriateness of using the word ""bereft"". I have had extensive exposure to the Services.

&gt;Also my point about Pakistan stands for India as well, both sides have a fear the other will someday decide to conquer them. That fear was more rational after partition and during the cold war, while both sides were armed by different factions, but now it's very unlikely, I wonder how a conflict would present.

I will also disagree with you at least in part here. While there are some fringe elements in India who call for an ""Akhand Bharat"", it does not make strategic and political sense any more. The larger fear is in Pakistan and to an extent it is justified but not in the sense of India ""conquering"" the country but if India doing a 1971 again but this time with Balochistan. Then there is the factor of the band of 300 KMs (approx) beyond the IB between India and Pak, which India can pretty much lay to waste.by abrogating the Indus Water Treaty. Again, it is unlikely India would take such a step but it is theoretically possible. As I have mentioned elsewhere and under different circumstances, India's real strategic problem lies in the North, East and in the maritime domain. But all this while interesting is irrelevant to the topic on hand.

I would like to clarify that I am not underplaying.your point about cultural affinity, but I think your point of the Russian forces approaching this as a ""police action"" is quite insightful and may help in explaining some of the events that we see are currently transpiring in Ukraine.",3a6bb21c9781763acc50e1e4db73e816ef07ecf2,True,False,,,,,0,1647580083,,0,{},i149dg0,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i146fjy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i149dg0/,1647580097,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647551283.0,

I wouldn't say bereft, but yeah it's not really there, not like Modi isn't trying though.

Partition was very nasty and scarred both countries deeply. 

Also my point about Pakistan stands for India as well, both sides have a fear the other will someday decide to conquer them. That fear was more rational after partition and during the cold war, while both sides were armed by different factions, but now it's very unlikely, I wonder how a conflict would present.

Plus, I don't think Russians want to fight a war really. They seem to feel they were pushed into this one, as something they have to do, and are waiting for it to suddenly get easier.

That's actually potentially good for them, the army might suddenly realize 'yeah these guys are never going to see us as liberators, weapons free', and take a grim outlook.

But if you saw some video of the engagements, it was clear the russian army wasn't looking for a fight, they were looking for almost a police action, and once contact was established, were fighting fairly defensively (at least that's what you do when the enemy is a lot of bushes that speak ukrainian and are armed with javelins.

Less than likely, in a broad sense. Mostly because of absolute terrible performance, but also because of TT&amp;P to do so and limited ability for flexible, broad spectrum, broad geometry equipment.

Jamming specific things that are set in stone, like GPS and enterprise data links, is easy to plan and build specific equipment for. To on the fly say ""I want to jam this frequency, in all places I am, in all directions this may attack from, and also not screw my own equipment"" is not a technologically cheap thing.

&gt;With this information, might a Switchblade-type munition be fired, directed to a coordinate, and then lock onto a pre-programmed visual pattern of the targeted equipment 

This is a legal nightmare (though I did actually submit it as a component to a system design proposal recently) and generally seems to be avoided.

In the presence of jamming, it's much preferred to just kill the thing blasting out the signal.

49% of the modernized Ukrainian tanks are T-64BVs model 2017, with a further 18% improved T-80UDs. I'm not sure how these tanks are inferior to the average modernized Russian MBT?

&gt;What's more, the outdated Russian tanks seem to largely be T-80U variants, which outmatch their outdated T-64 counterparts.

T-80Us make up only 38% of the losses among older models. Russia also has only around 100-200 of them in service in its entire military. It's in fact noteworthy that 44 have already been ID'ed as lost in Ukraine.

Note that only 6 out of the 44 have been lost to battle damage, which doesn't speak too well for their reliability. Also note that no T-80U loss has been sighted since March 10, which, given low total stocks, probably indicates that there's not many left with the invasion force.

61% of the ID'ed Russian MBT losses are T-64s and T-72s, old or new.

&gt;Even if I were to accept that their MBT forces are at rough parity, suggesting that being dramatically outnumbered and outmatched in AFVs/IFVs/APCs is merely incidental is ridiculous.

Outnumbered, yes. Outmatched, how so? The standard Russian IFV is the baseline BMP-2, same as the Ukrainians.

&gt;Russia fields far more mechanized companies, and those companies are on the whole better equipped than their Ukrainian counterparts.

Again, I agree with the first half of the sentence, but I see no evidence for the second.

&gt;Fires isn't limited to just artillery, and even artillery isn't just limited to MRLS, SPGs, and towed artillery.

I agree with the first part, but I'm not sure I understand what you mean with ""artillery isn't limited to MRLs and SP/towed artillery"". Do you mean infantry mortars?

&gt;Russia's missile forces and ground attack aircraft capability could be assumed to dramatically overmatch Ukraine's before this conflict began.

In theory. In practice, Russia appears to have a limited supply of PGMs and doesn't do CAS missions. At \~200 VKS sorties a day, the average Ukrainian soldier probably rarely notices the presence of Russian fixed-wing assets.

&gt;It is worth noting that BTGs are not simply just battalions.

BTGs are effectively basic maneuver battalions (motor rifle, tank or airborne) staffed with contract soldiers, to which have been grafted additional tank or infantry forces (depending on the type), as well as artillery/MRL/AD and sustainment assets. They're sub-brigade combined arms units, with up to 900 men instead of 400-600.

The UA isn't organized along the same principles. They have basic maneuver battalions, with the combined arms and sustainment capabilities organized at the brigade level. But just because those assets aren't organic to the battalions doesn't mean they're not there, so I see no reason to assume a lower combat value to the Ukrainian unit count.",6b559b9de62152a6d268f19df090d902559c0e3e,True,False,,,,,0,1647576671,,0,{},i143nh5,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i13os2r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i143nh5/,1647576685,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647547871.0,

I think Ukraine can win this, **if** supplied with the right equipment in the right numbers.

The Russians' best weapon is their artillery -- both tube and MRL. This can be detected with artillery-locating radar, and drones, and destroyed by both drones, and Ukrainian artillery.

The Russians' biggest weakness is logistics. The bast way to destroy this is by drone strikes on Russian columns. These strikes also hinder the Russians' ability to manoeuvre large formations.

So the most important things to send to Ukraine are:

* drones
* artillery, both tube and MRL. Former USSR artillery was exported to many countries and is still in use (and ammo manufactured) so a scheme buying these and sending them to Ukraine might work

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"It's hard to say what their stockpiles look like exactly, but I think we can make some reasonably educated guesses based on what we've seen so far. 

First, consider the fact that they were doing low-altitude missions with unguided bombs against an enemy with an abundance of MANPADs. They would have be surprisingly desperate to do that. I would think they must have used at least 50-75% of their arsenal of smart bombs to become that desperate; possibly much more.

I don't have exact statistics on how many bombing missions they ran, but in the videos I've seen of the conflict, I'd guess I saw about 5 missile attacks for every bombing. The highest reported figure of missile attacks I've seen to-date is 900 missiles launched into Ukraine which would suggest they may have dropped ~180 bombs into Ukraine. If half of those are dumb bombs from more recent missions, it would suggest their remaining smart bomb arsenal is perhaps 45-90 smart bombs, or possibly less. This is tiny but would make sense in the context of their risky low-altitude unguided bombing.

As for missiles, assume Russia's smart weapons have a shelf life of about 30 years. Since they were expecting a short conflict, assume they used all of the weapons that would have likely gone bad this year and next year within the first few days of the conflict. Most reports seem to indicate they used 320 missiles by March 1st (mostly Iskander missiles), so that likely represents at least 1/15th of their stockpile. This would suggest it is unlikely they have more than about 4,500 missiles remaining. If they had more, they probably would have used more on the expectation it would otherwise go to waste.

As for the lower bound, it seems unlikely that Russia would have been willing to use more than 1/2 of their missile stockpile against Ukraine by this point. The highest estimate I've seen of missiles fired into Ukraine is about 900. So given these bounds, Russia's remaining missile stockpile probably lies between 900-4,500 missiles.

I'm inclined to lean towards the lower bound of missiles simply because of their tactic of low-altitude unguided bombing. If they could use another 1,000 missiles and still have 3,500 to spare, I suspect they would do that instead of risking the loss of both a pilot and aircraft. So, I think the most likely estimate of their remaining stockpiles would be &lt;90 smart bombs, and ~1,500 missiles.",c2711be0d4d032ac827649a26f1ab7dc9a3b76c9,True,False,,,,,0,1647576528,,0,{},i143e58,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i13vhst,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i143e58/,1647576541,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647547728.0,

I was also referencing Oryx's dataset. You're cutting up the numbers in a fairly uneven way. It isn't simply that the numbers show that the Russians have approximately equal proportions of modern tanks, but they also show that those modern tanks are typically of higher quality than their Ukrainian counterparts (a third of the Russian modern tanks are T-80BVM and T-90A). What's more, the outdated Russian tanks seem to largely be T-80U variants, which outmatch their outdated T-64 counterparts.

&gt; I'd argue the numbers rather show that the MBT fleets are roughly tied, whereas the IFV/APC fleets are only overmatched. 

Even if I were to accept that their MBT forces are at rough parity, suggesting that being dramatically outnumbered and outmatched in AFVs/IFVs/APCs is merely incidental is ridiculous. Russia fields far more mechanized companies, and those companies are on the whole better equipped than their Ukrainian counterparts.

&gt; Note that the artillery ratios are also comparable, with Ukraine's park, however, having somewhat less mobility.

Fires isn't limited to just artillery, and even artillery isn't just limited to MRLS, SPGs, and towed artillery. Russia's missile forces and ground attack aircraft capability could be assumed to dramatically overmatch Ukraine's before this conflict began. While we have seen that the VKS isn't able to bring all its weight to bear, the Ukrainians almost certainly weren't preparing for a scenario where they had an intact air defense capability three weeks into the conflict.

Well, although technically correct ""most"" is somewhat of an exaggeration. I'd say its semi-modernized.

&gt;Russia has a large enough force that they don't need to employ all their grossly outdated equipment in the attack

In theory, yes. But that's not what they seem to be doing.

&gt;we can get a snapshot of their force composition in their losses.

Indeed. According to [Oryx's dataset](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html), out of 225 identified Russian/DPR/LPR MBT losses (with a further 17 confirmed but non-ID'ed), 116 are older 1980s models (**51.6%**). That's virtually the same as the figure for Ukraine's overall holdings (**51.5%**)!

It's also a higher figure than that provided by the IISS. This can be explained, however, by (1) the relative numerical importance of the DPR/LPR units in the overall invasion force and (2) the likely overrepresentation of older, less capable equipment among losses.

With that being said, point (2) is unlikely to make such a major difference as to fundamentally change the picture: the ratio of modern MBTs for Ukraine's forces is likely to be similar, if slightly inferior, to that found for Russian and Russian-led forces.

&gt;Russia's MBTs are clearly more modernized. I almost can't believe I'm having to argue this point.

As demonstrated above, there's no evidence for that assertion.

&gt;I also don't really understand how or why we're even pretending that Ukraine has parity with respect to mechanization.

Well, we can actually calculate the ratios. Across their total respective forces, Ukraine has 33 maneuver brigades (excluding Territorial Defense units) against 98 brigades/regiments for Russia. Here's the equipment shares by unit:

1. MBTs: 30 for Ukraine / 35 for Russia
2. AFVs (mainly recon): 17 for Ukraine / 18 for Russia
3. IFVs and APCs: 67 for Ukraine / 155 for Russia
4. Artillery: 37 for Ukraine (54% self-propelled) / 31 for Russia (83% self-propelled)
5. MRLs: 11 for Ukraine / 11 for Russia

&gt;Even if their MBT fleet is only overmatched, as opposed to be being grossly overmatched, the same can't be said for their AFVs/IFVs/APCs.

I'd argue the numbers rather show that the MBT fleets are roughly tied, whereas the IFV/APC fleets are only overmatched. Note that the artillery ratios are also comparable, with Ukraine's park, however, having somewhat less mobility.

&gt;My point still stands: Ukraine entered this war knowing it would be outmatched or severely outmatched by Russia in terms of maneuver forces and fires in all respects outside of light infantry.

They are overmatched **quantitatively**, yes. But unit-for-unit, their forces are actually pretty even in terms of material and modernization.

As for overall force ratios, here's the latest battalion count for **forces currently engaged** I've been able to arrive at based on open-source data:

**Ukraine:**

\-Regular units: 78x maneuver battalions

\-Territorial units: 42x maneuver battalions

For a total of 120x maneuver battalions.

**Russia:**

\-Regular units: 112x BTGs

\-DPR/LPR units: No precise data, but based on pre-war estimates, up to 34x maneuver battalions

For a total of up to 146x maneuver battalions

Thus, Russian and assorted forces would have up to \~190%\* of the ""heavy"" maneuver battalions of the defending Ukrainians in absolute terms.

Quote from the article:

&gt; The war has fully transitioned from a lightning strike designed to quickly take the capital to a protracted war of attrition. The Russians have implemented Grozny tactics, named for the devastation inflicted upon the Chechen capital in 1995 but also seen in Russia’s intervention in Syria. Though the immediate risk of collapse of Ukraine, or even Kyiv, has subsided, Russia has a stranglehold on the country, effectively cutting it off completely from naval resupply and significantly reducing the capacity for resupply by air. Russia now appears set to pressure Ukraine into accepting disadvantageous peace terms by inflicting horrific damage and casualties on the population of Ukraine’s major cities, strangling its economy and ability for resupply, and potentially causing a humanitarian disaster by disrupting the spring harvest. While Russia’s force is diminishing throughout Ukraine, Russia still poses a threat to major Ukrainian cities.",7041928199266abdbdcc6a0b541fa172080dc951,True,False,,,,,0,1647567130,,0,{},i13k8aa,True,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t3_tgpqvu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i13k8aa/,1647567142,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647538330.0,

Lester Grau is a fantastic Russian analyst, but I can't find that mentioned anywhere else in his [reviews of Russian doctrine](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/portals/7/hot%20spots/documents/russia/2017-07-the-russian-way-of-war-grau-bartles.pdf). It might even be a mistake to have said that word. He knows that Russian planning officers de-emphasise the need for frontline troops and overemphasise the need for fires elements. The sources he cites in his doctrine summary refer to ""Correlation of Force and Means"" (i.e. Force ratios), not ""manpower"". And all the sources he cites specify that it's NOT a numbers game. [Here is one source](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4200/RR4235/RAND_RR4235.pdf): 

&gt;[COFM] is determined through a
comparison of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of
subunits, units, formations, and weapons of friendly and troops
(forces) and of the enemy.

It's not about manpower and hasn't been since the Napoleonic Wars.

And it's clear Russia doesn't believe that a 4:1 ""manpower"" ratio is needed. Russia is attempting to clear cities with less than a 4:1 'manpower' ratio as we speak. 

Certainly no Western staff officers I've ever dealt with conflate ""force"" with manpower as you are here. A mid-Cold War estimate of [Soviet doctrinal force ratios](https://irp.fas.org/doddir/army/fm100-2-1.pdf) approved by the US Military says this: 

&gt;Contemporary Soviet writings indicate that an **aggregate ratio of combat power of approximately 3: 1** is sufficient in conducting an offensive operation or an attack against a defending enemy. 

Aggregate ratio is defined as:

&gt; It is,
instead, a more sophisticated calculation of the total force, to include all maneuver units and combat support that a commander can bring to bear relative to the total force with which the enemy can oppose him

...which is exactly what I said initially. So to answer your question: 

&gt;How do you measure the force ratio? 

It's an entire field of study for the Russians. They have models and tables and mathematical [equations that they use](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4200/RR4235/RAND_RR4235.pdf): 

&gt;The result of a correlation (comparison) of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of forces and means (subunits, units, military
weapons, military equipment, etc.) of friendly and enemy troops
(forces). It is calculated at operational and tactical levels within an
entire area (region) of action, along primary and other axes, and it
allows for a determination of the degree of objective superiority of
one of the opposing sides. The assessment of correlation of forces
and means facilitates the adoption of an informed decision on
the operation (battle)

I understand that you believe Russia needs a 4:1 manpower ratio to be successful. But Russian planners are probably hedging on destroying enough urban terrain that they don't need that many shooters. I agree with you and am very confused about how Russian planners think their assault on Kyiv will work out. But you guys are being way too dismissive of Russian doctrine and troops. I think it will be difficult for Russia to take Kyiv, but it's certainly possible once an encirclement is completed.",49c0729a1bbd8ffe6d375a761fd70132147fba8a,True,False,,,,,0,1647566958,,0,{},i13jut3,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i13574z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i13jut3/,1647566974,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647538158.0,

Exactly. Most of their MBT force is not modern (if 48.5% is modernized, that means that 51.5% is outdated).

Russia has a large enough force that they don't need to employ all their grossly outdated equipment in the attack, and even if we doubt force composition estimates, we can get a snapshot of their force composition in their losses. Russia's MBTs are clearly more modernized. I almost can't believe I'm having to argue this point.

I also don't really understand how or why we're even pretending that Ukraine has parity with respect to mechanization. Even if their MBT fleet is only overmatched, as opposed to be being grossly overmatched, the same can't be said for their AFVs/IFVs/APCs. The Russian forces involved in the invasion clearly have a much greater proportion of armored vehicles per soldier.

My point still stands: Ukraine entered this war knowing it would be outmatched or severely outmatched by Russia in terms of maneuver forces and fires in all respects outside of light infantry.",78123bccfd4df9ddabe145daa98f88c30ee87472,True,False,,,,,0,1647562340,,0,{},i139r8y,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i13287u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i139r8y/,1647562351,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647533540.0,

What are you basing that on? FDI into China rose from $187 billion in 2019 to $212 billion in 2020, to $249 billion in the first 9 months of 2021. Doesn't seem like FDI is fleeing out of China.

It probably helps that doing business in China has become much easier over the years. In just two years they went from [78th to 31st globally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_doing_business_index#Ranking), right above France.

&gt;All the talk is about decoupling from China, the only question being how quickly and to what extent. Their stance on Ukraine only seems to be accelerating the issue.

There's a risk of economic decoupling between these two countries but so far it hasn't really happened, and I don't think you can say that their stance on Ukraine is accelerating the issue either. That sounds like an opinion. It's not like China's stance is [unique anyway.](https://i.redd.it/72t5nevtqqk81.png)

This isn't special to the US btw.

The companies that do move, only move part of their operations away (China plus one strategy). Very few are completely leaving China.

It's just hard to replace China's workforce and consumer market. China has had higher wages than many other countries for many years now but that's clearly not the only thing companies care about. They're willing to pay higher costs if their product is guaranteed to be of a certain quality and that it gets finished/shipped in time, otherwise India would've replaced China long ago. They'd love a country which has a large labor force, where things get shipped in time and of expected quality, and where they have to pay 1 cent per hour, but this place doesn't exist.
