In fact, the Leopard 1 on offer are the first MBTs ever besides the T-72s from Poland. And if that is your choice, I'd rather have the Leopard 1A5 than no tank at all - even if they're not a challenger to fight other MBTs with.   


Ukraine seems to put Javelin, Panzerfaust and similar systems to good use against the MBTs anyway, so I think the Leopards would be moving against BMPs and other IVFs mainly, maybe rile up an artillery unit or Air defense, and for that, they can still be quite useful.   


Would I prefer we send them Leopard 2A4 or newer? Sure. But at this point, sending something that is available is a good thing, even if it might not be a monster of a system. Could we do more?

He could dump everything on Putin: corruption, bad economy, bad war, sanctions. Khrushchev pulled a similar move on Stalin, but it took him a few years of consolidating power before he did it. If Putin dies soon, his successor might be able to use the move to consolidate power: arrest and remove any opponent by accusing them of being Putinists. 

Yeah, don't expect a democratic regime to emerge, LOL. 

It will be another strong man.

But all the rest of the world would care for is Ruzzia fucking off from Ukraine. They'd probably immediately start trading with Ruzzia and lift the sanctions and even forgo international tribunals if Ruzzia retreated immediately to pre 2014 borders.

This wouldn't necessarily be great for Ukraine cause:

* Ruzzia would 100% refuse to pay anything as reparations
* the anti-west, anti-Ukrainian brainwashing will likely not be stopped
* Ruzzia might gear up and come back again 10-15-30-50 years later. It's what they do.

On the other hand, I doubt there's a way in which to make Ruzzia pay reparations. And you can't really invade them to denazify/deprogram them like with the nazis, cause these nazis have nukes. And you can't really invade or force a DMZ at the border either.

So perhaps Ukraine's best hope is:

* quick Putin death
* new guy takes over, blames Putin for everything, pulls back in order to focus on internal fight for power
* internal issues lead to Ruzzia breaking up (this would pose major issues, too, from securing the nukes and nuclear material and stopping it from falling into hands of terrorists, to the real possibility of major civil war(s) breaking out)",9a39c246a65e97bf33387576fccf510a1dc844b4,True,False,,,,,0,1653260524,,0,{},i9maynr,False,t3_uv9m6f,False,True,t1_i9jzzw2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv9m6f/apparentlyailing_putin_surrounded_by_docs_kremlin/i9maynr/,1653260539,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653231724.0,

Russian forces will likely attempt to hold positions west of the Siverskyi Donets River against Ukrainian attacks (rather than retreating across the river) to prevent further Ukrainian advances from threatening Russian lines of communication to Izyum.

Russian occupying forces continued filtration and deportation procedures in and around Mariupol.

394,[],False,,sweetcabbage101,,,[],,,,text,t2_7u9t3mkd,False,False,"1- Russia can replace long range sams like the S-Family. Ukraine can't replace any destroyed systems because they only had a limited amount to begin with. That's why they asked Bulgaria and Slovakia I believe for these systems. Only Slovakia said yes. Ukraine has some older Short range SAMS Like OSA, BUK, TOR and TRELLA. But none of them are upgraded to any good variants. They also rely on Older Tunguska systems. Many of these short range systems were destroyed already and lots of them were capture in the city of Balakliya in the Kharkiv Oblast. Their is a video showing the repair plant housing dozens of these systems. I can link of if you want. 

2-  my point with the damaged equipment is that since they no longer are able to repair in any high volume tanks and aircraft within Ukraine, they will have to spend more time, money and men to send them to other countries to get fixed. Yes, they still can get them fixed. But having to wait 2-3 days to put a tank back into service is night and day compared to 10-12 hours within Ukraine. Would you not agree? 

3- Given that Ukraine only operates machine equipment from the soviet Era and all their men are trained to operate these systems. It will take months of training, for example to give them Abrams Tanks or F-16s. Small systems like radars, mortars, anti tank launchers take only days. But we even saw with the M777 howitzers. Took the Artillery men over a week to learn. Ukraine can't be given large amount of foreign machinery to use because it take so much time to learn, they need equipment NOW, the best is to give them equipment they already know how to use. Germany is sending old BMP-1 Variants from storage, Poland old T-72M tanks, America is even sending afgany used MI-17 helicopters. It will simply take to long to teach them how to use other systems. Easy to learn systems like APCs from America and the UK are fine, because they aren't complicated and they will be used for transport not combat, but others take too long to teach. 

3- Ukraine began the war with roughly 500 units of MLRS (all of these figures are online) by 500 units I mean literally every single BM-21 GRAD sitting in storage for years. Since the war in the dombass started, DPR and LPRs main focus was to take out Artillery and MLRS production which were mostly based in the east of Ukraine. In 2015 and 2016, Russian forces destroyed several large areas of production acknowledged why Ukraines general staff. They have since tries to move produce to the west of the country but these manufacturing plants were built by the soviets, so these large complexes destroyed in the east were not going to be replicated. Costed way to much money and took the soviets years to build. Again, all of this information has been public since the war first started in 2014. 

Yes, Ukraine does produce Artillery rounds, but nowhere near the amount it ounce could. Let's not forget that in 2018-18-19, large warehouse with ammunition were blown up by DPR and LPR agents. 

Yes, Ukraine can get foreign supplied ammunition for Artillery, but figures provided show for every 3 rounds Ukraine fires, Russia fires 300. As stated by their general staff. Russia is estimated to at their peak fire 180,000 rounds per day and Ukraine something like 25,000- 30,000 I can't remember. So for America to announce its supplying Ukraine with 25,000 for Artillery, at most these rounds would last 3-4 days, a week tops. Let's not forget that Russia has dozens of Soviet manufacturering plants, so it's has no issues in keeping with demand. 

During a time where Ukraine can't get metal delivered from sea ports and a decent % of their rail systems are destroyed, I'm don't think any manufacturing plants are operating at 100%, would you not agree that's fair to say?

To put it briefly, it was common knowledge for everyone that Ukraine had a Artillery and tank shell shortage before the 2022 war, but now it's not getting better. If it was, They would not be asking for Artillery ammunition. 

4- research, a quick Google search will show you Russian manufacturing plants showing images of new T-90M tanks being produced and sent to the lines, anti radar air to ground missiles, Kaliber cruise missile manufacturing. They love to show off production lines in Russia, not very hard to find any images you want or articles from after the war started. 

If you want to learn about Russia doctrine which shows their supply chains, their is a book done by a international ISS expert, it's about 400 pages and shows you everything you wish to know about the Russian military, strategy and doctrine, along with supply lines and base formation. LMK if you want the link. It was done very recently as well, so it's up to date. 

5-  if you want sources, let me know. Russian telegram channels love to show off eliminated Ukrainian troops in the donbass daily. Sites like Oryx won't count many of these losses, because they get their information sent to them by Ukrainians and only a small portion of Russians. So it's easy to exaggerate Russian losses and undermine Ukrainian losses. These channels aren't exactly spread as much as Ukrainian ones. The images don't makes it onto CNN or other major media outlets because why would they want to undermine Ukrainian forces. Zelensky today announced roughly 100 Ukrainian solders are killed in the east every day, from these telegram channels it's clear 100 are destroyed on camera alone every day, far more off camera. 

Let's me know about any sources to want to read. Again, most of them you can find with a simple Google search.

How about any I could *verify*, rather than nothing?

&gt; It's all out there. People who have been following this conflict since 2014 know much of this as common knowledge.

They know Russian military replacement rates, 2022 sanction impact on the Russian economy, Ukrainian replacement rates, and the impact of new aid packages to NATO, from following a conflict in 2014????

Stuff like:
&gt;Russia has no issues produce ammunition for anything, they have no issues repairing vehicles or aircraft, they are bumping up production of cruise missiles and anti radar missiles

Sounds *incredibly* difficult to be ""common knowledge"".  So start with that.  How do you know that Russia has ""no issues produce (sic) ammunition for anything.""

Or that they're even *capable* of ""bumping up the production of cruise missiles""?  Are you tracking Russian chip imports since Feb?  Does watching the conflict since 2014 give you special insight into supply chains?

So you're not an ""arm-chair general"", but been following this since 2014, and seem to consider rather specialized knowledge of Russian procurement ""common knowledge"".

Uh huh.  If you're not an ""arm chair general"" then it sounds like you're quite literally a Russian logistics officer.

The fact that the Royal Navy is partially phasing out the harpoon and are arming its next generation of frigates with a newer Anti Ship missile, makes this hand over to Ukraine even more likely as the need to maintain large stocks of older Harpoons isn’t necessary during a phase out.  If a betting man were to guess why it hasn’t happened yet, the transfer of AA and SAMs are needed first to ensure harpoons survive long enough to be used.  The harpoon will be one of the single most expensive weapons transferred to Ukraine thus far, at a starting price of $1.2million a piece, and the doesn’t include the launch platform (heavy truck, ship or aircraft) or the radar/launch control systems, so no one is handing them over just to be airstriked 20min later.

To give you an example, the Brimstone’s that the UK just handed over to Ukraine are only $130k a piece and a javelin is somewhere between $80k and $180k, so risking a SAM site or AA just to protect those cheaper weapons it is a balancing act between cost and reward but a $1.2mil Harpoon, that’s not even a question about risking assets to protect it, it’s a forgone conclusion that it’s a priority to protect.",5ab428267710ca111ada51747a20f7e2b4ede5ac,True,False,,,,,0,1653257108,,0,{},i9m44es,False,t3_uvh4mh,False,True,t1_i9lt9ra,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvh4mh/us_might_strengthen_ukraines_naval_defense_with/i9m44es/,1653257124,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653228308.0,

&gt; A relative of a Syrian army lieutenant who signed up to fight in Ukraine denied his uncle was a mercenary.

&gt; Details: Medynskyi says that the Russian negotiating group allegedly sent written responses to the draft agreement that was proposed by Ukraine on 29 March in Istanbul.

&gt; On 20 May a member of the Russian negotiation group, Leonid Slutskyi, hinted that Ukraine should give a signal about resuming negotiations.

&gt; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation repeated Medynskyi&amp;#039;s words that Ukraine hasn&amp;#039;t responded to their written proposals for a peace agreement and blocks negotiations.

&gt;The money Norway earns from the war in Ukraine should return to the country, the Green Party (MDG) proposes.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- We can not enrich ourselves on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When the world discovers how much Norway earns from the war, we can be seen as war profiteers. We can not profit from a humanitarian catastrophe, says MDG leader Une Bastholm to VG .  
&gt;  
&gt;The party estimates that it will be around NOK 1,500 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The MDGs will instead give the money in the form of a Marshall aid - a fund for aid and reconstruction - to Ukraine. The money can also be used to counteract the food and energy crisis as a result of the invasion.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to the sum of NOK 1,500 billion, Bastholm refers to calculations made by macro and interest rate expert Dane Cekov at the major bank Nordea for Dagens Næringsliv. In comparison, Norway's state budget is NOK 1.6 trillion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lan Marie Berg emphasizes to VG that it can be both more or less.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The crucial principle Norway must establish is that the money we earn from the war will not be used in Norway, but to help Ukraine with help and reconstruction.

Thirdly, Sweden is not, under no circumstances, going to hand over any political refugees. It would destroy their excellent reputation. Not going to happen.

Government worried that traditional pro-Moscow sentiment in Gagauzia could destabilise region
Davide Lerner in Prolin, Moldova, 2022-05-22
In open fields to the west of Moldova’s border with Ukraine, a red, white and blue striped flag bearing three stars fluttered over thousands of Turkish and Russian-speaking Gagauzians. The 160,000-strong Orthodox Christian minority from south-eastern Moldova was celebrating Herdelez — St George’s Day — and the beginning of the pastoral year. But although horse races, local foods and games offered a distraction, the May 6 festivities were overshadowed by war — and officials in the Moldovan capital Chisinau were fretting about the region’s pro-Moscow sympathies. With Ukraine visible on the horizon, this traditionally Turkic-speaking but now largely Russophone people is anxious about what the coming months could bring. “My mum forbade me from coming to the festival, she doesn’t want me to be around crowds as you never know what can happen these days,” said 16-year-old Cristina from Ciadir Lunga, the region’s second-biggest town and a hotbed of pro-Russian Gagauzian separatists as the Soviet Union collapsed three decades ago. “I came anyway because I don’t even want to think about the war, it’s too scary.” Moldova’s southern Gagauzia region is one of the least developed areas of Europe’s poorest country. A southern part of historic Bessarabia, the region flipped in the 19th century from Ottoman to Russian then Romanian rule before falling under Soviet control after the second world war. It is emblematic of a corner of Europe shaped by a patchwork of ethnic identities, shifting borders and competing allegiances that have recently been amplified by Moscow’s war against Ukraine. Turkish involvement in the region goes back centuries, but in recent times Gagauzia has leaned towards Russia. Unlike Transnistria, the breakaway Moldovan enclave that fought a bloody separatist war in 1992 with backing from Moscow and has hosted Russian troops ever since, Gagauzia has avoided confrontation with Chisinau and settled for regional autonomy within Moldova.

But as US and Ukrainian officials warn Russian president Vladimir Putin could try to open a new front in Transnistria, Moldovan officials are also concerned about Gagauzia. “The local assembly is divided and still influenced by Russian narratives, which cause anxiety across Moldova. There are politicians who try to incite and divide,” said Iulian Groza, a member of the Moldovan Supreme Security Council, which advises the president on security strategy. Charles King, an academic who has written a book on Moldova, described the Gagauzians as a “largely forgotten minority within an overlooked republic”. He counted as many as 19 explanations for the Gagauzians’ ethnic origins, the most common being that they are descendants of Christianised Turks. But he also noted that no other group in Moldova speaks Russian as widely. “In Comrat [the regional capital] we mostly speak Russian, we use Gagauzian mostly for jokes, as it is spoken more widely in smaller villages and towns,” said 39-year-old Vitali Barbarica, who formerly drove buses to and from Moscow and is now a driving instructor. “Russia is just closer to our way of thinking.”

As in Transnistria, Gagauzia has kept its Soviet-era statues of Lenin, with one standing in front of the regional authority headquarters. In the region’s 2015 elections, Irina Vlah, the governor, campaigned under the slogan being “Together with Russia”. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the start of its war in eastern Ukraine, Gagauzians voted in a local referendum deemed illegal by Chisinau for the region to develop closer ties with Moscow rather than with the EU. Earlier this month, a report in Romanian language newspaper ZDG based on extensive video interviews suggested many Gagauzians believed that if Putin had not started the current war, Ukraine would have invaded Russia. Tensions rose briefly in the run-up to Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on May 9, when local officials said they would ignore a central government ban on Soviet symbols largely seen as pro-Russian, among them the Ribbon of Saint George, as well as the “Z” and “V” marks displayed by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. The government deemed displaying the symbols was tantamount to celebrating Moscow’s invasion. Sergiu Litvinenco, Moldova’s justice minister, called the pledge by local authorities to defy the ban “an illegal act that must be erased” , while Russia’s foreign ministry warned of a “painful” response by Moscow.

Local government attempts to rescind the ban were overturned by a Moldovan court, although escalation was avoided through “intensive dialogue”, Groza said. Some Gagauzians are conciliatory. “We don’t want conflict, we’re living in the republic of Moldova. We have a good country, perhaps not the best in the world, but it’s a very good country,” said 58-year-old Sergey Anastasov, Comrat’s mayor. But mistrust towards Chisinau remains. Ina, a 40-year-old teacher from the city of Cadir Lunga, criticised the central government’s ban on Russian symbols ahead of May 9 and said Moldovan media did not fairly reflect Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We need to look for our own sources to get a fair coverage,” she said. Many people celebrating the Herdelez festival were reluctant to discuss politics. Georgie, wearing a traditional Gagauzian hat, noted that Moldova and Gagauzia were powerless in the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. “Nobody wants the war, we don’t want the war, but what can we do?” he said. Anna Statova, the owner of a traditional Gagauzian restaurant that had just won a prize at the festival, added: “We are just hundreds of metres from Ukraine, so it’s hard not to feel their pain.” This story has been corrected to note that Sergiu Litvinenco is Moldova’s justice minister and that he described the pledge by local authorities to defy the ban on displaying Soviet symbols as illegal.",289a700be48db560524d77e68e2931c8b25d2607,True,False,,,,,0,1653256147,,0,{},i9m23hz,True,t3_uvl1yl,False,True,t3_uvl1yl,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvl1yl/moldovan_minority_treads_line_between_russia_and/i9m23hz/,1653256161,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653227347.0,

Indeed, strategic pragmatism warrants a frank conversation between NATO and Ukraine about curbing Kyiv’s ambitions and settling for an outcome that falls short of “victory.” “",e1306915cf52f1ca0475d48de6c701595630d82e,True,False,,,,,0,1653254672,,0,{},i9lz0as,True,t3_uvkjed,False,True,t3_uvkjed,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvkjed/ukraines_way_out_charles_kupchan/i9lz0as/,1653254688,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653225872.0,

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

One thing about the U.S. is we have a lot of refining capacity over and above what we need for domestic consumption on all sorts of end products.  Our domestic oil production handles our domestic end product needs for the most part.  We tend to import due to cheaper prices in some cases but primarily to reexport the end products.(like a steel mill that imports ore and exports steel).  


On the simplification side one thing to keep in mind is that U.S. production is more market oriented than pretty much anywhere else.  There are hundreds of producers rather than one state owned or controlled oil company.  U.S. companies drill to meet a contract or sell at a set price.  


When the shale fracking boom first happened costs were exceedingly high for drilling wells because a lot of the infrastructure didn't exist.  I drove around South Texas cities as a kid and often wondered why in the hell some of the towns even existed when a huge number of the buildings were falling down(how did they built in the first place?)  Then I saw Karnes City a year after the boom started(google street view it) and got it.  


Basically what happened the last time oil got this high is massive amounts of money poured into production of fracking wells and very large amounts of infrastructure(pipelines, hotels, truck stops, man camps) got built.  The Saudis and Russians not wanting to lose market share(the U.S. reallowed raw crude exports during this time) kept pumping to save market share.  As prices fell the frackers innovated quite a bit and started cutting labor costs(lunch ladies at school district were quitting their jobs to make 60k a year logging trucks at gates, etc.)  They started doing stuff like drilling 12 horizontal wells from the same site to save on assembly costs.  


Then Covid happened and the bottom fell out for everyone.  Latent production was so high and demand fell so fast that they literally ran out of storage and future speculators were having to pay people to take the oil they had to take delivery of with no method to use or deliver it.

Because of the circumstances of the hard landing it's a bit difficult to know what the general well costs are for frackers right now.  Most but not all of the hard infrastructure still exists but a bunch of the labor and housing moved on.  I joked last time I wish there had been a way to short white pick up trucks(there were a lot for sale).  


Best case geopolitical scenario is for the frackers to get back at it and as they ramp up production we put the screws to people buying from Russia and get some price reduction in equal measure.",927fc99963003aff58f8b6497781309bbd7b6228,True,False,,,,,0,1653254248,,0,{},i9ly3ew,False,t3_uv2ekn,False,True,t1_i9ks5jj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv2ekn/us_aims_to_cripple_russian_oil_industry_officials/i9ly3ew/,1653254259,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653225448.0,

None of these countries are fascist. 

Nazi Germany said that [Fascism movement is a Jewish movement and that Mussolini is a tool of the Jews.](https://www.jta.org/1924/12/29/archive/german-anti-semites-renounce-fascisti-as-their-name)

Francoist Spain backstabbed the Falangist after the civil war.

Imperial Japan was at it's name says, imperialist. 

The one that came closest was Italy, but after Mussolini had to concede to Gabriele d'Annunzio in 1921 it strayed off from Classical Fascism and **The Kingdom of Italy** was a mixture of multiple ideologies including: 

liberalism (1922-1925: characterized by market liberalization and privatization) 

state socialism (1925-1939: highest rate of state ownership of an economy in the world other than the Soviet Union, drastic improvement of living standards and life expectancy of Italians)

war-time economy: (1939-1943)

There's going to come a point where they may indeed have tanks, equipment and manpower, but are operationally depleted. They may have an enormous stockpile of munitions or mothballed vehicles, but how many run? It takes time and money to deploy equipment, only to end up losing it. You can throw conscripts into battle, but their adversaries will be battle hardened and experienced, which amounts to throwing your mem away. We can compare it to WW2, where the Soviets threw men into the grinder, but those losses actually won them territory, so there was at least a victory to weigh it against. In Ukraine, they lose manpower and equipment for a couple of kilometers. So how long until it all falls apart? And if Putin truly has a life threatening illness, will the RF abandon the war?

The shift comes nearly three months after Russian and American officials alike predicted a quick and decisive victory for Moscow. After the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers and an avalanche of failures since the invasion began Feb. 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin has narrowed his objectives in a campaign viewed as unsustainable, unrealistic — and likely unwinnable.

That assessment is shared by an array of observers, including Western intelligence officials and independent analysts who have tracked the war closely. Russia, said Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service, is losing in Ukraine militarily, politically and morally.

“When we look at the battlefield, Russia’s conventional capacity is already overstretched,” Marran said. “The losses in Russian manpower and equipment are not sustainable at the same operations tempo that we have seen so far.”

Russia proposes that people over 40 can sign up for war to help offset setbacks

Unless Russia launches a full-scale mobilization of its military, Marran said, it has “no remedy in sight.” And while it appears that “some sense of reality has kicked in” among Russian military leaders, Putin himself remains intent on controlling everything from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine to the western port city of Odessa and Transnistria, a breakaway republic in neighboring Moldova.

“We might be seeing a continuing military campaign that is, to a degree, detached from what is realistic, from what might be called smart or feasible in the long term,” Marran said. The Estonians had long predicted, even before the invasion, that Russia would face significant resistance from the Ukrainians.

As the war grinds on and Russia’s battlefield gains remain “uneven” and “incremental,” according to the Pentagon’s latest assessment, several of its high-ranking commanders have been sacked. Among them, according to the British Ministry of Defense, are Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, who presided over the 1st Guards Tank Army’s failed effort to capture the northeastern city of Kharkiv, and Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, who was in charge of Russia’s Black Sea fleet when Ukrainian forces sank its flagship, the Moskva. The humiliating blow to Russia’s navy was carried out using the Neptune anti-ship missiles that Ukraine makes. Since then, officials in Kyiv have stepped up their requests for similar weapons from Western partners.

Citing the latest U.S. intelligence assessments of the war, a senior Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, affirmed that “Russian commanders at various levels have been relieved of their duties.” Pentagon officials, this person said, want to be cautious in making predictions about the war’s next phase, but they are encouraged that Ukrainian units have not faced the morale setbacks that plague the Russians.

Russia retains considerable combat power available in Ukraine, the U.S. defense official warned, but “you’ve got to have the will to fight, you have to have good leadership, you have to have command and control.” Russia, he said, is “suffering” as a result of these and other shortcomings.

Meanwhile, sanctions against Russia have caused the country’s transport and shipping logistics to be “practically broken,” Russia’s transport minister said Saturday, a rare admission of problems.

But its defense minister asserted that its military had destroyed a large number of weapons that were supplied to Ukraine by the United States and European countries. A Pentagon spokesperson told The Washington Post that the United States had no comment on Russia’s claim.

Russia also stepped up its political campaign, permanently banning nearly 1,000 Americans, including President Biden and Vice President Harris, from entering the country. The list of those banned included a wide range of officials and citizens, including lawmakers who have died and actor Morgan Freeman.

The United States continues to send billions of dollars in military equipment to Ukraine, including heavy artillery, drones and antitank missiles. President Biden on Saturday signed a $40 billion package of new military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.

Although Putin has deployed more than 100 battalion tactical groups into Ukraine, each numbering between 500 and 800 personnel, they have made little headway in Donbas, U.S. intelligence shows. There is evidence that the Russian military has divided some units, dispatching smaller combat teams into villages and hamlets there. Doing so, the Pentagon assessed, makes sense as Putin pursues smaller localized goals. But Russia has struggled to hold ground, with its forces sometimes ceding control back to Ukraine within days of having seized territory.

Russians attacking in smaller units, Pentagon says

In the south, Russia has secured two significant victories, taking control of Mariupol, a major port city, and the smaller city of Kherson. Micholeiv, home to nearly 500,000 people before the war, has been an unattainable objective, however, despite weeks of heavy fighting nearby.

Scott Boston, a former U.S. Army officer who studies the Ukraine war for Rand Corp., said it appears there are massive morale problems within the Russian military, undermining Moscow’s goals. He cited the refusal of some units to carry out orders, as well as Russia’s failure to adequately equip and feed its forces.

“Once it has been abundantly demonstrated that they don’t give a crap about their people, they get it,” Boston said of Russian soldiers. “It’s hard not to notice.”

Russia has seized only a couple kilometers per day in Donbas in recent weeks, according to the Pentagon. At that rate, Boston surmised, the offensive could continue for a year and “there will still be a lot of Ukraine left,” even as Russian military fatalities continue to mount.

“That’s just not a serious proposition,” Boston said.

Russian leaders may realize their military campaign is floundering but still reluctant to acknowledge they are losing the war, he added.

Earlier this month, dozens of Russian combat vehicles were destroyed by Ukrainian forces as the Russians attempted to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in Donbas. The attack is believed to have killed hundreds of Russian troops, and appeared to highlight their continued failings to carry out basic combat maneuvers.

Rob Lee, a Russian military expert and a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said Russian troops have been bedeviled both by their own tactical blunders and the Ukrainian’s potent capabilities that have contributed to routs like the deadly crossing near Severodonetsk.

River crossings require favorable terrain and construction of pontoon bridges by military engineers. They are inherently dangerous, Lee said, and the Ukrainian military probably anticipated likely crossing points and logged their coordinates for future attacks. Their surveillance drones allowed artillery units to observe where rounds were falling and then guided them onto Russian personnel.

A grave mistake, Lee said, was the failure of Russian commanders to send smaller numbers of troops across the river. Instead, they bunched them together. The mistake cost the 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade dearly, according to an analysis from the Institute of the Study of War, with an estimated 485 casualties and the loss of 80 pieces of equipment.

“It’s an indication there are leadership problems still,” Lee said of the botched attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces nearby.

It’s hard to say how long Russia may keep its offensive going, said Boston, the Rand Corp. analyst. Even after the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers, he said, Russia could continue to lob artillery rounds from a distance for some time.

Still, the trajectory of the conflict perplexes him. Russia defeated Georgian forces in a five-day war in 2008, but the conflict exposed failures within the Russian military, including an inability to quickly adapt when something goes wrong. Moscow set out to reform its military after that conflict, Boston said, and demonstrated improvement in others.

“You just get this feeling like they’ve abandoned everything they’ve tried to learn over the last 10 years and reverted to an older style that they’re more comfortable with,” Boston said. “Frankly, the Red Army in 1944 was more capable of fire and maneuver than a lot of what we’ve seen from this Russian military, and I don’t understand why.”

Heightened autonomy isn't about neighbouring countries, it's about the local populace (which, yes, may include demographics similar to neighbouring countries) and easing the feeling of chafing under rules and government that they feel don't represent them. Picture the US - state laws exist and can trump federal ones for precisely this reason. A heavy-republican state in the south can pass a law even if ""those darned liberal elites in Washington"" are in power at the White House passing more liberal versions of those laws. It eases tensions between very different states when you allow them to customise what applies to them. A voter will feel better saying ""We just have to change the governor of our state to change things"" rather than demanding a nationwide swing of 5%+ to get something changed that everyone in the state hates.

Whether or not that's needed in this case or not, I don't particularly know or care.

The most plausible outcome of attacking NATO ships, one borne out by numerous incidents around the world involving the US navy, is that NATO/the US will immediately sink/destroy a far more significant naval asset of the enemy as a response.

It's virtually an automatic reflex, enforcing the position that nobody attacks the US navy with impunity. US naval forces are too spread out around the world, vulnerable to too many hostile nations, for them to take any other stance than wild, unreasonably excessive force in response to any attack. Otherwise they'd be pecked at and harassed all the time.

If a US/NATO ship is attacked by Russia, the US will sink Russia's Black Sea Fleet in response. Without question. They wouldn't even think about the consequences; you attack a US ship then you're done. Russia can shriek and squeal and threaten full scale nuclear war if the US dares do it, the US will shrug and do it anyway, then humbly forgive Russia for forcing them to do it. The US would sooner see Europe overrun by the new USSR than give up total naval dominance over the entire world.

Also, Putin is not the escalation man. He's a game strategist, like the rest of the FSB, GRU, etc. He has calculated that the West will always blink first, which means if your escalation doesn't work, escalate more until they blink. This kind of game strategy is defeated by punishing escalation early, knowing that Putin does have predictable red lines of his own that from Russia's position of comparative weakness will be crossed first.",52eb9bad93a4025f993f0d1e1f28381fc492f86e,True,False,,,,,0,1653250119,,0,{},i9lp49w,False,t3_uveqam,False,True,t1_i9kxwv0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uveqam/putin_has_weaponized_world_food_supply_a_naval/i9lp49w/,1653250137,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653221319.0,

Herem russia literally saying it out loud

Russian propaganda is definitly depicting the war in ukraine as a war against NATO and you are doing the exact same here

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is a difference between a formal declaration of war and what is actually going on. Got that, or is it too difficult to understand?

Apparently you dont know what propaganda is, let me help you educate yourself with the oxford dictionary:

 *propaganda*  
*/ˌprɑpəˈɡændə/*   
  
*ideas or statements that may be false or exaggerated and that are used in order to gain support for a political leader, party, etc.*  
*enemy propaganda*  
*a propaganda campaign*

[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american\_english/propaganda#:\~:text=noun-,noun,political%20leader%2C%20party%2C%20etc](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/propaganda#:~:text=noun-,noun,political%20leader%2C%20party%2C%20etc).

&gt;What do you think sanctions are? What do you think weapon deliveries are? What do you think intelligence support is? What do you think getting rid of energy dependence is? I tell you what it is: It is the West fighting Russian aggression.

That isnt a war, you just previously explained why it isnt....way to contradict yourself

&gt;But even if, for the sake of an even playing field, small minds' games of technicalities are allowed as a valid argument, it doesn't matter at all. The ONLY thing capable of threatening Western Europe is Russia. Eliminating that threat by putting our weapons to use, no matter by whom, is certainly the better option than to let Russia get away with the invasion of one nation after the other while constantly gaining strength. The best time to do that is now (actaully a decade ago).

I guess you dont know a country called China exists...and that every country with nukes is a threat to any other country on the planet, that is literally the point of having nukes as a deterrence...

I am not sure how this supports your argument? Yes, if those that knowingly spread misinformation in an organized manner are prosecuted that would practically guarantee that the US will never conduct a murderous invasion ever again. That is precisely the point.

Again this is not about an average Joe expressing an opinion that say Iraqis are all terrorists and a murderous invasion against them is justified. This is about people who put significant resources towards manipulating the American public into 72% support of the murderous invasion - a number that has since dropped to 26% now that Americans actually have access to accurate information.

Mentioning the first amendment as an excuse is ridiculous. First of all it was adopted in 1791, more than a century before mass media was even a thing. Second it's literally an amendment, as in ADDITION OR CHANGE to existing laws which clearly means that further amendments can be made. Third US laws have clear precedents against false information and mass manipulation when it comes to commodities, commerce and markets. It is absolutely ridiculous that property and finance is under such protections but not human lives and democracy.

Slight technical point. Russian law doesn't allow for renunciation of citizenship until you have a different citizenship.

Sure, its a technicality. If you're looking to renounce your citizenship you might not care about the laws of your home country. But there are future considerations, like after Putin is deposed or dies or whatever, you might want to return to your homeland and help rebuild it into a better nation.

Many Russians have left the country though already, and some stay and fight however they can. Most though either support the war or simply cannot leave, due to family or no ability to actually leave. To leave a country you need money, otherwise you'll get no help in another country.

Its easy to say what Russians should do, but the reality is that it isn't always possible.",4e5836c22a888ceb4a6d61ff63f4980228b971bf,True,False,,,,,0,1653248221,,0,{},i9lkz5z,False,t3_uvg025,False,True,t1_i9ligux,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvg025/russian_military_used_350_hostages_in_yahidne/i9lkz5z/,1653248236,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653219421.0,

So Republican voters owe me an apology for voting for somebody who said I should die, that my toddler should die before I'm ""fucked beyond saving"" for not trusting them. And they are ready to vote for him again.

So before they are trustworthy, they owe me an apology for voting for that, for supporting that, and they owe me a promise that they'll never support my or my child's death again. That's fair, right?

One of Russia's many failed objectives was Hostomel airport near Kyiv Credit: AFP 
Once this decapitation strategy had failed, the Russian offensive rapidly became bogged down in Kyiv’s wooded hinterland. After a month of increasingly heavy casualties, the invaders withdrew to the border to lick their wounds. 
What they left behind, however, were corpses, mass graves and other evidence of crimes against humanity. The evidence of atrocities first found in Bucha and then in almost every town or village liberated since has opened the eyes of the world to horrors that will dominate the memory of this war.
Perhaps the most brutal fighting of all has taken place in the Siege of Mariupol: an epic struggle lasting more than 80 days that culminated in a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks. 
Conspicuous in this siege was the Azov Battalion or Regiment, a unit in the Ukrainian National Guard with neo-Nazi origins and insignia. The Azov plays an outsize role in Russian propaganda, in order to justify Putin’s claim that his aim is the “denazification” of Ukraine.
Yet the undeniable courage of the defenders of Mariupol, by contrast with the ruthlessness of the besieging Russians — who refused to allow civilians to leave or to treat soldiers as prisoners of war — has turned this into yet another propaganda victory for Ukraine. 
The fate of Mariupol’s pre-war population of more than 400,000 is still unclear — hundreds have been deported to an area near North Korea — but at least 20,000 civilians died in this once-prosperous port, now reduced to rubble. Its name, however, will be cherished by Ukrainians because by holding out for so long, it tied up Russian forces that might otherwise have tipped the balance in the battle of Donbas which began six weeks ago.
Having damaged but failed to take the high-tech hub of Kharkiv, once the “Silicon Valley” of Ukraine, the depleted Russian hordes are now concentrating their efforts on capturing the remaining Donbas region. 
The aim is to hold a rigged referendum in Kherson to add a third puppet “republic” to the separatist enclaves of Luhansk and Donetsk. However, the catastrophe that has now befallen the occupied areas of Donbas is indescribable.
A Ukrainian genocide
Speaking on Thursday, Zelensky declared that Donbas had been “completely destroyed…it’s hell there, and that is no exaggeration”. The occupied territories appear to have been largely depopulated. How?
What has happened in Donbas and elsewhere are mass deportations via “filtration camps” to the remotest regions of Russia, some as much as 5,500 miles away from home. The Pentagon has confirmed the existence of these camps, where mothers are separated from their children. Ukrainians designated as “Nazis” are sent to concentration camps to be tortured, killed, or used as slave labourers.
Earlier this month Ukraine’s human rights chief Lyudmyla Denisova put the number deported at 1.19 million, including 200,000 children, many of whom are being adopted by force. According to leaked Kremlin documents, plans were made before the invasion to deport 2 million Ukrainians and the process is still under way. Meanwhile ethnic Russians are being moved into the areas vacated by Ukrainians.
The existence of more than 1,300 Russian camps and of the forced removal of more than a million civilians is so shocking that the world has hardly begun to digest the news. It means that the nightmare of Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago has returned, this time directed against a democratic European country. There is only one word for this crime: genocide.
All this is happening under the auspices of Vladimir Putin. He alone is responsible for unleashing untold misery upon Ukrainians, whom he claims are really fellow Russians. Yet such a colossal act of iniquity could not have happened without thousands, maybe millions, of willing accomplices.
What has made the war and all that has flowed from it possible is the systematic destruction of civil society in Russia. Since he took office 22 years ago, Putin has crushed dissent, silenced the independent press and lobotomised the population — while the free world largely turned a blind eye.
Europe's soft underbelly
Putin had a smorgasbord of temptations with which to woo the West: oligarchs with cash to launder in London and New York; lucrative investment opportunities in Russia; and cultural exchanges galore, including exhibitions, ballet companies and musicians — prominent among them Putin’s favourites Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko. In 2014 the British Museum loaned some of the Elgin Marbles to the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. Despite the annexation of Crimea, it was business as usual, from athletes to architects. 
Above all, Putin offered Europe cheap energy: gas, oil and coal. The steep post-pandemic rise in global prices for hydrocarbons rendered many countries even more dependent on Russia. No wonder many beneficiaries on both sides did not want to believe that the era of Londongrad and Ostpolitik, of cosy summits with vodka and caviar, was over.
Even now, after three months of carnage on the Continent, the three biggest nations in the European Union are still struggling to adjust to the reality of their predicament. None of the leaders of France, Germany or Italy has made a gesture of solidarity by visiting Kyiv. All three have dragged their feet on arms and sanctions. All three call for a ceasefire, not a Russian withdrawal.
Emmanuel Macron persists in his belief that direct talks with Putin will yield a compromise acceptable to both sides. He insists that Russia must not be “humiliated”, but stands accused by Zelensky of offering to hand over Ukrainian land to Putin — an accusation he denies. 
Olaf Scholz clings to his policy of avoiding “escalation” at all costs, despite defeats in regional elections which suggest that German public opinion would like him to pursue the tougher line forged by his Green Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock. Germany is still paying billions for Russian gas.
Italy’s technocrat Prime Minister Mario Draghi would prefer a harder line, but his coalition partners and opponents — from old Putin cronies, such as Silvio Berlusconi, to populists, such as Matteo Salvini — are all soft on Russia.
 
Britain's unwavering support for Ukraine has put France, Germany and Italy to shame Credit: AFP 
Boris Johnson, by contrast, has shown true leadership and is clear that he wants Ukraine to win the war. Most Nato partners have followed suit, including (after a few wobbles) Joe Biden. The US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, is clear that Russia must be “weakened”.
Putin's Downfall
Yet despite these differences, the West has remained united in its determination that Russia should not get away with this assault on a sovereign nation. This is a war between barbarism and civilisation. 
Putin remains dangerous, mainly thanks to Russia’s nuclear arsenal — a considerable part of which was handed over by Ukraine under the terms of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, supposedly guaranteed by the US and Britain. The deterrent is the only remaining asset that entitles him to great power status, but as Col Khodarenok told his viewers, nuclear sabre-rattling actually “looks quite amusing” when the world is against Russia.
Now the control freak in the Kremlin is trying to second-guess his officers on the ground, many of whom are paying with their lives for strategic mistakes made in Moscow. It is all too reminiscent of the last days of Adolf Hitler, memorably depicted by the actor Bruno Ganz in the 2004 film Downfall.
Like Hitler, Putin has become obsessed with the operational detail of war. Like Hitler, Putin is rumoured to be a sick man, pumped full of drugs to treat probable cancer and possible Parkinson’s. Like Hitler, with his V1 flying bombs and V2 rockets, Putin revels in miracle weapons to exact retribution on the West, such as his hypersonic missiles and Poseidon submarine drones. The latter, a TV anchor gloated, could cause a tsunami big enough to submerge the British Isles.
None of these revenge fantasies will save Putin. He has no choice but to double down on his disastrous decision. As long as he is in the Kremlin, the sanctions will never be lifted. But Russia does have a choice: it can follow the dictator into the abyss, or depose him before it is too late. Putin’s downfall does not have to be Russia’s.

Despite its vast geographical size, the Russian economy is by most measures only equivalent to that of South Korea, or a medium-sized West European country. The impact of sanctions will probably cause it to shrink further, from roughly the size of Spain to that of Portugal. 
Catalogue of errors 
Russia’s abysmal demographics (low fertility, low life expectancy, mass emigration), environmental mayhem and rampant corruption mean that the long-term socio-economic outlook is grim. The war has accelerated the decline of this vast, resource-rich land into a third-world basket case.
Indeed, the catastrophic mistakes by the state organs responsible for prosecuting war have shone an unforgiving light onto the arachnid-like activities of the Russian securocrats.
Putin has been lashing out at generals, admirals and intelligence chiefs — all hand-picked by him. 
Many have been sacked or are under arrest; several oligarchs have died in suspicious circumstances. There have been no show trials yet; this is a purge by stealth. Nobody has yet dared to point a finger at the man at the centre of the web.
After the chaotic advance on and even more chaotic retreat from Kyiv, Putin despatched his army Chief of Staff, General Gerasimov, to take charge of the Donbas offensive in the south-east of Ukraine. 
But the President, having already usurped the role of commander-in-chief, has now taken to micromanaging small army units at a tactical level — the role of a colonel. Such exercises in remote control by a former intelligence officer with no experience in the field is not only undignified but utterly inefficient.
Putin has long been in the habit of treating his veteran Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, in this fashion. An American diplomat told me that when he sat opposite Lavrov in long and complex negotiations, the minister would frequently pick up his phone and whisper “Putin” to his team. Nothing could be agreed until the boss was satisfied.
Putin’s ubiquitous role in the Russian regime, dominating both military and civilian life, helps to explain how the Russian armed forces came to suffer their worst defeats since 1945 in Ukraine — where many of the biggest and bloodiest battles of the Second World War were once fought.
The initial three-pronged assault aimed to use airborne special forces to decapitate the Ukrainian Government, while two army groups swiftly captured the capital, Kyiv, in the north and the second largest city, Kharkiv, in the east.
Meanwhile a third army group would seize Mariupol on the Sea of Azov and Kherson in Donbas, then roll up the Black Sea coast towards Odessa, Ukraine’s major port, supported by naval forces and amphibious landings. The entire “special operation” would be over in a few days - or at most, a couple of weeks.
Every single part of Putin’s battle plan proved to be based on false assumptions. He believed that his own army was overwhelmingly superior, both in training and equipment, and that his air force would immediately secure control of the skies. 
In reality, his troops were brutalised boys, badly led by incompetent, complacent and corrupt officers, reminiscent of their British counterparts in the Crimean War. And just as at Balaclava, “someone had blundered”.
Entourage of sycophants
That someone was Putin. His fatal blunder was to underestimate the Ukrainians. In part thanks to the British soldiers who trained them, but mainly due to their own professionalism, skill and courage, they have proved more than a match for the Russians.
This mistake was blamed on bad intelligence, but the truth is that all the President’s men told him what they thought he wanted to hear — and nothing else. To contradict, to challenge, to stand up to him is, sometimes literally, toxic. Putin has only himself to blame for surrounding himself with an entourage of sycophants.
A despot who has journalists and opposition leaders shot in cold blood, who sends assassins to poison his enemies in hotels and cathedral cities, cannot be surprised if the world he inhabits — a world of paranoia, fear and revenge — becomes increasingly divorced from reality. The tyrant who cannot tolerate those who live in truth is doomed to live in lies.
The present Russian military doctrine was devised by Putin’s favourite general, Valery Gerasimov. Notorious for its application in the annexation of Crimea, the Gerasimov Doctrine advocates “asymmetric warfare” — terrorism, subversion, propaganda, mercenary armies and more — to gain a military advantage.

As Lt General Sir Robert Fry, the former commander of the Royal Marines and now a professor at KCL, points out, “the Ukrainians have been far better practitioners of the Gerasimov Doctrine than the Russians”. Their partisans played a major role in disrupting Russian supply lines and Kyiv has run rings around Moscow in the media war.
Of all Putin’s unforced errors, perhaps the most egregious has been his refusal to take his chief adversary seriously. In public, at least, he refuses even to name Volodymyr Zelensky, just as he will never name the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. It is as though the Russian autocrat believed that for him, the heir to Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Stalin, to utter the name would somehow empower the Ukrainian President. 
Yet the story of the past three months has been the apotheosis of Zelensky and the downfall of Putin. The Russian has been in power for longer than anyone since Stalin, while the Ukrainian came from nowhere: a Jewish comedian who mocked the high and mighty — exactly the kind of person who in Russia ends up in a penal colony. Yet it is Zelensky who will be remembered as a hero, while Putin will be consigned to the dustbin of history.
Strategic failure
On Putin’s orders, at least three and possibly as many as a dozen attempts  to assassinate Zelensky, carried out by Wagner Group mercenaries and Chechen units, were thwarted in the early days of the invasion. A concerted attempt by Spetznatz paratroopers and other elite forces to seize and hold Hostomel Airport near the capital was repelled, with heavy casualties.",797031080fa0e9c24c9d1b33a5499b8a3baf779f,True,False,,,,,0,1653246275,,0,{},i9lgpqd,True,t3_uv8e3v,False,True,t1_i9jsuwy,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv8e3v/putins_catastrophic_war_has_exposed_russia_as_a/i9lgpqd/,1653246289,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653217475.0,

“For me, of course, Styopushka is the most beloved name, my term of endearment,” said Lidiya Oseyeva, Oseyev's mother and the director of the village school, using a diminutive version of her son’s name.

Although he enlisted in the army in 2014, Oseyev was never meant for a military life, his mother said.

“He had no choice,” she told RFE/RL. “I couldn’t give him a good education to open opportunities for him. Joining the army was the only way out for us. Styopa was a builder by nature. He wasn’t made for war. But he ended up having to fight.”

Oseyeva tried to avoid speaking about her former husband, Oseyev's father, saying only that “he lived badly” and that she worried constantly that he would “shame her.”

“His life ended badly,” she added.

In school, Oseyev stood out as a curious and hard-working student with a passion for volleyball that he maintained to the end of his life.

Vietnamese communism is complex. The Vietnamese are fiercely independent, so Russia and China never really had a shot at being more than weapons suppliers of convenience. If Vietnam could have avoided communism in the early years, they likely would have but it was clear from their observations of the wider world that the path to a small country shaking off the colonial yoke of the 'great nations' was one that only had a few avenues and they went all in anti-colonial, which at the time meant full mobilisation of the population, which meant everyone had to be politically aligned, which also meant that there were excesses to go with the successes. War is rarely good v evil, but usually some messy combination. In the case of the Vietnam war, the Vietnamese desire for independence was greater than the US desire to keep it a European holding, or moreover spend blood for the Dulles brother's obsession with keeping big industry $ commerce in the preeminent position (something which communism was of course the antithesis to).

The negative sentiment in the US was many pronged: people were sick of throwing US bodies at something which had low odds of actually being more than a local problem, they also started to empathise with the Vietnamese generally. It was slow process, but seeing napalm burned babies and the victims of Mai Lai  and other places stack up, actually had an effect. When the answer to 'winning' Vietnam was the same as the one russia proposes in Ukraine, ie, killing everyone there, then you know you've hit the moral wall.


I give the US credit though, in spite of these stumbles, it has slowly started to shake off the mindset which led to Vietnam. That takes some looking inward. There are still plenty of people who think like the 1960's conservative, but they grow fewer by the day (if not more vocal as they watch the changes happen).",63aded45bf89e0765b236b93245cb904b5945b8c,True,False,,,,,0,1653244180,,0,{},i9lc2ve,False,t3_uuuubu,False,True,t1_i9jqq6b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uuuubu/the_defence_of_mariupol_seems_to_be_unprecedented/i9lc2ve/,1653244194,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653215380.0,

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. The Iraqi Army was large, and had fought an enormous war with Iran about a decade before. That is enough time for the army to recover, but also recent enough that the lessons learned would still be fresh. There should have been a lot of people there with experience. Iraq should have put up a really good fight.

My thesis is that the success of the US and allies is Desert Storm was not because the Iraqi Army was bad, but because the US and allies had invented a new form of warfare that emphasizes precision weapons and information integration over firepower. This change in doctrine is as revolutionary a change in warfare as the use of gunpowder.

In 2014 Russia attacked Ukraine successfully. The Russian military probably wasn't more effective then. But Russia and Ukraine still both used doctrines that evolved from WW2 fighting. Since 2014 the US and Western allies have been teaching the precision/information warfare techniques and Ukraine fights Russia much more effectively.

Doctrine is difficult to change. There Ukrainians did a lot of learning at the small unit level, but there wasn't enough time to adopt the new way of warfare at the larger level. For instance the air force hadn't changed over to precision weapons yet, nor had artillery.  If they had been the war would have been over already.

&gt; The Ukraine war will make it difficult for its defence industry to revive sales and is likely to lead to further declines in arms exports to Southeast Asia, according to the report&amp;#039;s author, Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Russian armed forces&amp;#039; poor performance on the battlefield has caused significant reputational damage to Russian-manufactured military hardware,&amp;quot; Storey said.

&gt; &amp;quot;India has already made alternate plans for potential disruption, chiefly by focusing more on &amp;#039;made in India&amp;#039; components to stave off possible shortages,&amp;quot; Koh said, adding that smaller clients such as Indonesia also recently expressed concerns about maintenance, repairs and overhaul of Russian equipment, especially the Su-30s. Koh said spare parts were an important source of revenue for Moscow - especially when taking into consideration the generally higher level of maintenance Russian equipment requires compared to Western equivalents.

&gt;In recent months, Ukraine has experienced a wave of unchecked vigilantism. Institute Respublica, a local pro-democracy NGO, reported  
 that activists are frequently harassed by vigilantes when holding legal  
 meetings or rallies related to politically-controversial positions,   
such as the promotion of LGBT rights or opposition to the war. Azov and   
other militias have attacked anti-fascist demonstrations, city council meetings, media outlets, art exhibitions, foreign students and Roma.  
 Progressive activists describe a new climate of fear that they say has   
been intensifying ever since last year's near-fatal stabbing of anti-war  
 activist Stas Serhiyenko, which is believed to have been perpetrated by  
 an extremist group named C14 (the name refers to a 14-word   
slogan popular among white supremacists). Brutal attacks this month on   
International Women’s Day marches in several Ukrainian cities prompted   
an unusually forceful statement from Amnesty International, which warned  
 that ""the Ukrainian state is rapidly losing its monopoly on violence.”

I wouldn't be surprised if Poland and other Eastern European countries allowed some technicians to go to Western Ukraine to help assess the state of the airframes and figure out what parts are needed.

Some aircraft are designed for easy servicing. For example the entire engine might be taken out and replaced with a spare in a few hours total. With the right supply of spare engines, an aircraft can be in the air again the same day while the engines can be repaired on a test stand and added back to the supply of spares.

""In fact, the people, held in the basement, were used as human shields because the school was the headquarters of Russian military,"" the PGO stressed.

“It is noted that more than 350 locals, including 77 children with 5 infants among them, were held in a room of 197 square meters for almost a month. The youngest child was one and a half months old, and the oldest hostage was 93 years old. Due to inhumane conditions – lack of sufficient space, sanitation, access to air, food, water – ten elderly people died.”

Nothing about Patriot is published. The stats you posted are just made up. Nobody knows what it's true range and capabilities are. But I can promise you it's better then anything the Russians have. 

It is well known that Russian radar tech is decades behind the west. Go look at any defense blog on Russian radar design. The design of their fighter radars is well known. And they are all complete dogshit compared to what's used on US fighter. 

An example of how shit Russian radar is: Iran is still flying F4 Phantom which is 60 year old US plane. Russia been trying to sell them newest Russian planes for decades now. They always refuse, instead scouring the world for F4 spare parts. 

The reason why Iran wants 60 year old F4 over brand new Russian plane? They say the radar is better. I wish I was kidding. Iran has tested brand new Russian jets and found that 60 year old US F4 has a better targeting radar.

The more time the F-35 flies against the S-400, the more chance some way of targeting the F-35 is discovered. Russia would discover that easily because they would be providing technicians to service and update the S-400. Any tests that involve both the S-400 and the F-35 would be done in carefully controlled conditions to make sure that the results don't leak. 

Normally the F-35 flies with a radar reflector mounted on the outside. That way the tracking systems only see the steering signals from the reflector and any subtleties are drowned out. Any military would naturally want to minimize the opportunities for a possible opponent to learn about their weapons before the shooting starts.

People make a huge deal about the Swedish sub that ""sunk"" a US aircraft carrier in a war game a few years ago. But that news didn't bother me that much. It is very possible that the sub was detected, but the US Navy didn't respond since they didn't want to reveal their capabilities.The US Navy sharply limits the peacetime use of active sonar because it has been discovered that high power active sonar damages marine life. But in the cases of a real war active sonar would be used to detect the Swedish sub.

No war game is valuable if the opposing team doesn't win some of the time. If the opposing sub is detected 100 nautical miles away, the proper response is ""That's great. But what if that detection system was damaged? What happens next?"" Now the simulation is rerun without that system. And that process repeats over and over.

A timeless reminder:

What do you think sanctions are? What do you think weapon deliveries are? What do you think intelligence support is? What do you think getting rid of energy dependence is? I tell you what it is: It is the West fighting Russian aggression.

But even if, for the sake of an even playing field, small minds' games of technicalities are allowed as a valid argument, it doesn't matter at all. The ONLY thing capable of threatening Western Europe is Russia. Eliminating that threat by putting our weapons to use, no matter by whom, is certainly the better option than to let Russia get away with the invasion of one nation after the other while constantly gaining strength.

The war and Western sanctions have become a serious problem for Russia in the implementation of the Arctic LNG-2 project, which was left without Western technologies.

Russia has problems in the Arctic LNG-2 project. Chinese companies, which in fact remained Moscow's last hope under the sanctions, do not want to risk their entire business because of one specific contract and announce a possible withdrawal from the project. Russian expert Anatoly Nesmiyan writes about this in his  telegram channel .

According to him, Russia came to the LNG market very late, considering this technology as a secondary one, but made a big mistake. ""Russian LNG projects are united by the main thing: Russia came to the LNG market very late, considering this technology as a whim and something very secondary, which is generally understandable: more technologically advanced at all levels, more complex and much more incomprehensible to top management , which understands only one thing: pump, send through the pipe and rustle the proceeds. That is why, even against the backdrop of the global LNG boom, Russia spoke quite contemptuously about this segment and repeated the same mantra: we will see how they go bankrupt. to everything that does not relate to the ""pipe"", the attitude was approximately the same. To shale technologies, for example. Back in the 13th year, Miller condescendingly gave ""shale"" a year at most. It is not surprising that with such an expert level the gas industry has reached a catastrophe, burying tens of billions in idle projects , which, on top of everything else, have to be supported by endless wars,"" he notes. Nesmiyan emphasizes that the technological backwardness in Russia's natural resources industries and in the LNG technology segment is ""egregious"". According to him, the Arctic conditions for the implementation of the project are critically dependent on Western corporations that have the necessary technologies and left the Russian market after the start of the war with Ukraine. Russia's only hope is China, but now it is in no hurry to help in Moscow. “Now the Chinese are also thinking. And LNG is perhaps the only chance to somehow survive under the sanctions, since a tanker is a tanker. And if it is caulked on the one hand, then on the other hand, sooner or later, it will be necessary to tighten the valve , ""the expert notes. Earlier it was reported that LNG is a real alternative to Russian gas , and its use allows accelerating the process of forming energy independence from the Russian Federation. It is also known that Europe uses the available opportunities to reduce the level of consumption of Russian gas.",f89484917008fa367a5f8c2cdbae436ab633258d,True,False,,,,,0,1653239288,,0,{},i9l0tzt,False,t3_uvdzvc,False,True,t3_uvdzvc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uvdzvc/due_to_the_sanctions_five_chinese_companies_are/i9l0tzt/,1653239306,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653210488.0,

Let's compare the policies Trump implemented versus that of Mussolini:

Referring to the economics of John Maynard Keynes as ""useful introduction to fascist economics"", Mussolini spent Italy into a structural deficit that grew exponentially.[18] In Mussolini’s first year as Prime Minister in 1922, Italy's national debt stood at 93 billion lire. By 1934, Italian historian Gaetano Salvemini, estimated Italy's national debt had risen to 149 billion lire.[19] In 1943, The New York Times put Italy’s national debt as 406 billion lire.[20]

*A former school teacher, Mussolini’s spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini ""instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivaled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed"".[21] As for the scope and spending on social welfare programs, Italian fascism ""compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive"".[22] When New York city politician Grover Aloysius Whalen asked Mussolini about the meaning behind Italian fascism in 1939, the reply was: ""It is like your New Deal!"".[23]*

*By 1925, the Fascist government had ""embarked upon an elaborate program"" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance.[24] As for public works, the Mussolini's administration ""devoted 400 million lire of public monies"" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922.*",c74cb2c42c46fd80458cd20e38d2833abc8da139,True,False,,,,,0,1653239267,,0,{},i9l0s83,False,t3_uucx6x,False,True,t1_i9g9z0n,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uucx6x/worlds_leading_specialist_on_totalitarianism/i9l0s83/,1653239282,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653210467.0,

&gt;Yet in many ways, the dossier proved prescient. The Mueller probe found that Russia had been making efforts to meddle in the 2016 campaign, and that Trump campaign members and surrogates had promoted and retweeted Russian-produced political content alleging voter fraud and criminal activity on the part of Hillary Clinton. Investigators determined there had been ""numerous links -- i.e. contacts -- between Trump campaign officials and individuals having ties to the Russian government."" And, proof emerged that the Trump Organization had been discussing a real estate deal in Moscow during the campaign.

&gt;All were findings that had been signaled, at least broadly, in Steele's work.

I'd add to this that while the pee tape (which really wouldn't be shocking at all at this point) is denied by all who knew Trump including Michael Cohen, Cohen has since acknowledged that Trump has watched ""with delight"" [a golden shower at a Vegas sex club](https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-cohen-new-book-trump-golden-showers-vegas-club-2020-8) at least once.

2230,[],False,,IrrationalPoise,,,[],,,,text,t2_hhvep9n5,False,False,"Well, she's sort of right but also half wrong. If she had a full solar system she could run her lights AC and everything off of it, as long as the sun was shining. With a state of the art home energy storage system she'd get whole home power for two to three hours off of it. More realistically since no one does whole home power off of the shelf she'd be able to keep her fridge running and have lights and outlets on in her kitchen for 6 to 8 hours. Technically she could have full off grid power from battery but it would be insanely expensive, and she'd have to buy EV batteries have someone wire them up for her and take a lot of risks with the system. I don't think a city or a utility system would sign off on her doing that, and I think her homeowner's insurance would have something to say about it too. She'd also have to pay for everything out of pocket because there is no leasing/financing option for something like this.

So to answer your question about her she could pay or finance $200k for a solar system, and run her AC and lights off solar during the day, but at night she'd be running grid power. Since Florida isn't really wind power friendly that means fossil fuels or nuclear energy. If she wanted to throw down $500k or so she could get a fully off grid system, but she'd have to be entirely off grid and she'd be assuming all maintenance costs and risks of running a custom system.

There's other reasons she might not believe in renewables too. A lot of time solar companies will charge for and install significantly more solar panels than are needed. This is to maximize the money homeowners get from selling energy, and help pay off the system. Sometimes they don't communicate that very well leaving buyers with the impression they got scammed. Also there are shady solar companies that install panels, get people on the hook to pay for them, and then never pull permits or arrange to turn them on leaving them paying for fines and a system they can't use. A lot of time they also screw up people's roofs during the installation. One of my coworkers parents had that happen to them, and her dad swears up and down that all solar is a scam now. 

Probably one of the biggest problems with renewables right now is that most of the people who advocate for them don't really have a grasp of their limitations. As a consequence politicians don't really craft realistic policies around them, and we're stuck with what are stop gap methods that leave us producing more carbon than we need to with the tech we actually have in hand.  The reason I'm on about air source heat pumps and electric forced air heating is that this is existing and relatively cheap technology that we can put in place quickly that would substantially reduce carbon emissions compared to burning natural gas for heat.

Renewable advocates have a habit of dismissing anyone who tries to point out shortcomings with renewable or problems in the industry as a climate change denier which means that efforts to address those shortcomings are often late or lacking.",599b9545c61ecbfc1ac790e7df5ff0925cc7d4c4,True,False,,,,,0,1653238225,,0,{},i9ky8aw,False,t3_uuna5h,False,True,t1_i9kkvs1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uuna5h/germany_and_italy_approved_russian_gas_payments/i9ky8aw/,1653238243,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653209425.0,

This is a guy who's about the same age as me. He grew up in the Soviet Union in the 80's and was pretty young when it dissolved. His mother is half Ukrainian and has a Ukrainian last name. He has friends and relatives in Ukraine and has traveled and lived all over the West, including a semester at Stanford here in my own California. He's educated in economics and built a good life for himself, and his career until recently was in building power stations. 

Now he has a wife and kids and everything around him is crumbling. He risks going to jail if he even says the word ""War."" He streams every day, carefully dancing just up to the line, and talks about what's happening in Russia and how it's impacting industry, the economy, people's behavior, and so on. 

It was really clear that he was unhappy with the war from the start, but Bucha was a real turning point. He seemed devastated. 

He can be pretty funny once you know how to read between the lines, like when the Moskva was sunk he did a stream about it, asking how, as a taxpayer, he should feel about the utter incompetence and the loss of all that money. 

He did one recently about how he thinks the tide of public opinion in Russia is starting to turn and he's hearing more references to ""1984"" everywhere.

Is he a coward for not openly opposing the war? Maybe, but if I was the sole support for my partner and kids and stood to lose everything by standing alone against it, I might make the same choice. He's trying to do what he can from the inside by getting the word out to the West about what's going on inside of Russia.

Once you hear all those stories about Bucha, raped babies, wifes saying on phone how they would torture Ukrainian children and cut off their ears it's really hard to not grow bitter and hateful. 

What I do is that I always tell myself those are the WORST examples of people they can bring up, and as terrible those are, they are not all like that. But those stories get a lot of attention now, because they make for ""good"" news and they are good propaganda.

The amount of pillaging, murder and rape experienced throughout all the occupied areas also points towards a more widespread, more representative problem, so while it's ""not every Russian"" it definitely is ""plenty Russians"", even if not most. But I always tell myself that those people are heavily indoctrinated, brainwashed, extremely poor, extremely uneducated, and probably have suffered a lot of hardship in their lives, where nobody, often not even the own family, came to their help or could been relied on. They come from a tough place. 

While that doesn't really excuse anything, and doesn't mean they can change or I want to come even close to them, it kind of shifts a lot of the blame to the Russian elite, their leadership, but also their cultural figures, which let that nation degrade so much (which probably was a process started by... who knows, Tzar Alexander? Maybe even before!). 

It is those few cases of brave Russians speaking up, that one story I read where a Russian soldier refused to shoot civilians, helped a Ukrainian girl escape (she lost her mother in the process) while he got shot by his own comrades for doing so, which let me hope that even Russians actually CAN be born with basic human empathy and kindness, critical thinking and CAN actually resist all those toxic influences.

This is why if I were to meet a Russian now, I would EXPECT him to be one of the bad ones (although I think the chance of him being one of those potential rapist murderers still being very slim), but I would HOPE he would be one of the good ones.

And that hope is what I cling to, because it allows me to actually notice that he's one of the good ones. If I only expect him to be terrible it would be a classic prejudice, and I would be no better in my sense of superiority than the bad Russians.",895cae958373206ba8484ab152c076289bc64dbd,True,False,,,,,0,1653237416,,0,{},i9kw8wm,False,t3_uv7q7u,False,True,t1_i9krri1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv7q7u/young_urban_russians_attend_a_concert_in_st/i9kw8wm/,1653237432,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653208616.0,

By this token, every Russian combatant should be sentenced for their participation in the campaign. But the pilot in question is not being tried for participation in the campaign. Ukraine implicitly accepts that Russian servicemen are combatants as defined by the Geneva Conventions and they treat POWs as POWs. Compare that to how the US did not recognize islamic militants as such and denied them POW status.

What is uncommon is that: (1).  this is generally the way rivals behave not allies and (2). Erdogan's demands are so absurd as to be non-starters.

Likely outcomes are that either NATO gives in to one or two of the more acceptable demands which they probably would have anyways, but now it is more difficult to give in to Turkey, US puts the screws to Erdogan and gets him to back down, or that NATO creates NATO 2.0 which is a separate organization from NATO that functions alongside NATO but includes Sweden/Finland but not Turkey.

Morally, well, *everything* Russia does in Ukraine is immoral. But that's not the topic at hand. We're discussing whether–regardless of morality—the pilot still had the right to kill the farmer with a pitchfork.

I'm not saying the man has never changed his mind. On the contrary he was flippantly saying Ukraine would be easy last year. I'm saying that it's a false narrative to think that just because he said Ukraine wouldn't be easy now, that Ukrainian forces are decently trained and motivated, and that global isolation is bad, that this means he thinks Russia can't or won't win. 

He clearly does think Russia can win and has thought so since long before these media outlets declared he'd 'changed his mind'.

I read his article from February. The difference is that I'm the only one here who seems to have read literally _anything else_ he's written. Anyway, that article predicted well the international response to Ukraine. That just means he has a better idea of how the rest of the world thinks than the Kremlin does, which I don't dispute. 

But he absolutely did **not** say it ""wouldn't be worth it"" to invade and has in fact never questioned the invasion itself, which would be crossing a clear red line in what's allowed in Russia.

&gt; and two ""video clips"" of two different appearences on their 60 minute

He's been on the show many times, before the war as well. The clips that got the biggest circulation was one where he explained why mobilization wouldn't be the 'quick fix' the other propagandists were acting like, which is again consistent with his view that the war is not _easy_. The other was him complaining about international isolation and how 'saber-rattling' was stupid and so on, which is the one that got the most attention. That's the ""one clip"" I'm talking about. 

Then people invented this 'he changed his mind' narrative when they saw yet another clip where he was talking about the supposed destruction of American M777 howitzers. But that was something he'd railed about on his Telegram well before the first clips even got attention. It was no change of position at all. 

This article is saying this:

&gt;By Thursday, Khodaryonok had changed his tune. Instead of criticizing Russian logistical failures, he bragged about Russia's military might and condemned western-made weapons.

What I'm saying all you need to do is take one look at his Telegram channel or what he writes for Gazeta.ru and realize that he does this all day, every day. There's no change of mind here at all.

So what I’m getting from everyone’s info is that Fracking is expensive and buying foreign oil is better than using up your own oil supply so the fracking rigs don’t stay working BUT when oil prices in the countries we buy from get out of hand the fracking comes back online and provides cheap oil which ultimately forces offshore oil companies to step up production massively in order to bring the value of their own oil down to compete with our cheap fracking oil.  At that point Fracking goes “offline” again because prices have normalized.

As for Putin being backed into a corner - no shit, he ‘could’ use a nuke. And if he were, he would be pressing the ‘self-destruct ruZZia’ button. Everyone knows this, and they know that they cannot win, especially with the condition of their military and economy currently. The moment they use a tactical nuke, they’ve crossed a new boundary that they know NATO will respond with incredible force. A force unrivaled to anything ruZZia wishes it could do.

There is no way around it - tactical nuke = absolute end of ruZZia as they/we know it. They doubted that the west would be united in supporting Ukraine in February.

This is the thing that discussions on this sub keep missing. Putin is not an omnipotent despot. He has an entire clique of supporters so robust they've gotten their own nickname (the siloviki). All of them have gotten wealthy and powerful by supporting him. All of them have *everything* to lose, from their dachas to their families, if he presses the button. Because they all know that if there's a nuclear exchange, the US will absolutely, unquestionably turn them and everything they love into radioactive dust. There's not an edge case where survival of the leadership is a possibility here. Even if they hide in a bunker first, those things aren't designed to survive a direct hit in the megaton range. The ""we will target and kill your leadership in a retaliatory strike"" thing is part of the deterrent. It engages that self preservation instinct because you *know* that the other guy has nothing to lose and will dedicate a dozen warheads for you, personally, out of spite at that point.

&gt; Throughout all of this, the threat of nuclear conflict has remained low. Even when Lavrov said it was ""considerable"" it still officially remained low.

Lavrov and the rest have been pretty clear on their messaging. When asked a direct question about it by someone who isn't a Russian media personality, their response is always the same: we have a doctrine, we're sticking to the doctrine. That doctrine rules out first strike unless some specific conditions can be met. Ukraine can't meet any of them (it can't pose an existential threat, it likely can't jeopardize their arsenal, etc.). The only one that's even vaguely murky is Crimea. If there's ever to be a deployment in this war, it's going to be if Sevastopol is under threat. 

&gt; Ukraine, in the future, may end up being viewed as ""Russia's Iraq/Afghanistan"".

Russia's Afghanistan was Afghanistan. They clearly intended this to be their Iraq with a lightning conventional victory. It has turned into an absolute bloodbath. They had suffered more total casualties than Coalition forces (through the entire conflict!) by like week three or  something. 

To put their losses into perspective, go watch their parade in Moscow this month. The total number of soldiers that patrolled through the city streets, a parade so long it feels functionally endless? That's less than their combat losses in Ukraine. It's turned into an incomprehensibly bloody, grinding conventional war compared to the wars of maneuver we've come to expect from the 21st century.",3a83bce60c52354cf0f52304205a83532f1a5ba6,True,False,,,,,0,1653235638,,0,{},i9ks1js,False,t3_uv4nb3,False,True,t1_i9kkgg7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv4nb3/sen_mitt_romney_suggests_nato_could_engage_in/i9ks1js/,1653235651,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653206838.0,

This is a situation that’s fast approaching in Ukraine, especially if a Ukrainian offensive traps a substantial portion of Russian forces by cutting off their supply and retreat lines. Russia could very well use a nuclear weapon at that point to force a negotiated settlement. That’s a very real scenario that the U.S., NATO, and the EU should all be discussing on a contingency basis so they have a plan if it happens. Is it likely? Probably not, yet. Is it possible? Absolutely, and not like a 1-2% chance either, more like 20-30% and it will jump much higher, very quickly, if Ukraine makes an offensive push that threatens to cut off Russian forces. 

The people calling it fear-mongering or Russian propaganda are usually the same ones who demanded a no fly zone or castigated the U.S. for not sending Polish planes a month or two ago. So far, this situation has been managed really well at a slow burn that’s avoided exploding, which is exactly where it needs to be. It’s a great opportunity for the U.S. and the E.U. to weaken Russia if they can do it without it leading to open war. What happens to Ukraine and the Ukrainians at the end is really of no consequence from a political or strategic standpoint, any more than the fate of Afghanistan mattered once the Soviets were bled white there. The Ukrainians would do well to remember that or they’re going to feel bitterly betrayed when they’re cut loose at the end of all this. It’s an alliance of convenience currently and when it’s no longer convenient then it’ll no longer be an alliance.

I definitively can't answer this, but maybe some mentions why this effect could be bigger than it seems at first glance:  


1) Covid-Deaths are likely spread more among elderly and/or sick people.

The war-deaths (on Russian side) overproportionally affect young and physically probably healthy people. Possible workforce.

2) While Covid-deaths might affect a gender more than the other (I don't know any statistics, could be equal as well), the deaths here again affect 99.9% only males (my assumption). That could have a stronger effect on population development, than compared to 50/50 deaths.

3) Not war-deaths, but as an additional factor the brain-drain that is happening adds directly on top of the effects here.

&gt;The Azov movement was established in May 2014 during the Donbas crisis to sustain Ukrainian control over Eastern Ukraine. Initially known as the “Black Corps,” it was a paramilitary unit of radical nationalists. Scholars suggested that the name “Black Corps” was itself a reference to the official German Schutzstaffel (SS) periodical published in 1935-1944 (Das Schwarze Korps). Some members, including the unit’s leader Andriy Biletsky, espoused nationalist socialists views.

....

&gt;One possible pool of such hotheads were the “ultras”—soccer hooligans who had a semblance of an interpersonal network, were seasoned in street clashes with opposing gangs, and united by a kind of a collective identity. As one senior member of Azov told me in a 2020 interview, “When I went to the East, I had no political opinions, I was a tough ‘ultras’ guy neither afraid of to be beaten nor reluctant to smash one’s head—and I kind-a felt this was the sort of people who were needed.”


....


&gt;Another pool of volunteers was the rightists. Products of the culture of militancy, often hardened in clandestine training camps since the late 2000s, they were washed in a particular organizational culture with recognizable Nazi paraphernalia (a swastika, a sun wheel, a Black Sun, and a Wolfsangel). In this, they were similar to other anti-liberal counter-cultural rightists active all over Europe and the United States. Another and a more original component of their symbolic repertoire traces back to the 1930s and the legacy of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. This organization waged guerrilla warfare against the Soviets, Poles, and Germans. To complicate the matters even further, the group entered into a tactical alliance with Nazi Germany but turned against Germans in 1941. Besides, between 1945 and 1960 the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists cooperated sporadically with the American and British governments. This complicated and bloody legacy from a complicated and bloody era is open to conflicting interpretations: Were they “freedom-fighters”? Some admirers think so. “Fascist terrorists”? Others take that view. Ukrainian rightists obviously prefer the first interpretation. Leftists take a different view.

&gt;Ukrainian ultras and rightists merged in 2014. Some established the Black Corps—as a counterpart Russia’s “little green men” who were instrumental in annexing Crimea and destabilizing the Donbas. At the moment of inception, there were no more than 50 members, but they were growing. The successful defense of Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, was the Black Corps’s moment in the sun. To commemorate the victory, the group changed its name to Azov Battalion. And they began to grow even faster, their reputation as fearsome defenders of Ukraine bringing in torrents of new recruits.",e6c560a1b86a33c1c662c52f7efdd2c6f8914b6f,True,False,,,,,0,1653234096,,0,{},i9kogxx,False,t3_uv9d2v,False,True,t1_i9knadx,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv9d2v/numerous_neonazis_are_fighting_for_russia_in/i9kogxx/,1653234110,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653205296.0,

It's not as if Putin's government will punish them, so why not, right? Hell, instead they'll pin some medals on their chests, like after Bucha.

As I said, once your horde has been ejected, and the forensic teams do their business, there will be a reckoning.

Unlike after WW2 when your troops raped their way to Berlin, the West won't be encumbered by Cold War politics.

Western propaganda is an interesting beast, because it invades every facet of our media, and almost always subtle. It's hard to pin on any specific person or organization, because so many are involved. The upcoming Top Gun movie is a great example.

When the first Top Gun came out, military recruiters posted up outside of theaters, and military recruitment increased 500% that year. The American military has been very financially involved in many war movies ever since then.

The invasion of Iraq was unjustly justified on our news outlets, as were many of our wars and conflicts. Gulf of Tonkin seems really fishy, in particular.

It's really hard to know what's going on in a place in the other side of the planet. All you have to go on is what other people have to say. People with their own agendas, people lacking in the honesty department.

I will reiterate once more, since you seem to be taking a combative stance - I am with you. Nothing the US does or doesn't do can be used to justify another nation's actions. Russia's aggression cannot stand.

I just also think that when this is over, we need to take a serious look at some of our striking similarities to Russia. Imperialism is alive and well in both countries. Propaganda shapes the opinions in both. Both countries are divided by ethnic lines. Both consider themselves above other nations.

Read the article with an actual honest mind and you will see that all the times the journalist takes a quote to illustrate his point the quote has little to do with what he claims.

&gt;One big concern is that a Ukrainian win could destabilize Russia, making it even more unpredictable and putting a normalization of energy links further out of reach. 

Listened to this exact speech, Macron never mentioned energy in it. Russian energy is basically irrelevant to french energy mix so abandoning russian energy never was a problem for France. This is a severe twisting of Macron's speech to make energy something relevant to this.

&gt;“We are not at war with Russia,” Macron said in an address at the European Parliament in Strasbourg last week, stressing that Europe’s “duty is to stand with Ukraine to achieve a ceasefire, then build peace.”

It's as vanilla as it comes as far as speeches go, of course this war will eventually end up with a ceasefire and hopefullly some peace building, nowhere is territorial concessions mentioned. Somehow the ""stand with Ukraine"" part never gets mentioned.

&gt;Macron also declared that, after peace was achieved, Europe would have to construct “new balances of security” — the kind of phrase that sets off alarm bells in Central and Eastern European countries, where it is seen as code for rewarding Putin with a say over what happens on their territory.

More ""reading between the lines to try and build up an argument out of nothing"". Does anyone want to build imbalances of security after the war? 

&gt;Scholz struck a similar note during a lengthy telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. After the call, Scholz said via Twitter that he had pushed three points with Putin, the first of which was: “There must be a ceasefire in Ukraine as quickly as possible.”

&gt;A demand that Russia immediately retreat and withdraw all its forces from Ukrainian territory was notably not among the three points. In an interview over the weekend with German news outlet T-Online, Scholz, who delayed sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine, said Germany would continue to support sanctions against Russia, while repeating his call for a diplomatic solution. 

Ah okey, so now from one Tweet where Scholz did not specifically say Russia should leave we understand that he wants Russia to stay despite him saying repeatedly in other media that Russia should leave? Wouldn't it more honest to just assume it was implied since he made his position repeatedly known in the past? Not for this journalist apparently.

&gt;Even as they stress their support for Ukraine, the fact that the leaders of the EU’s three largest countries have adopted nearly identical talking points on peace negotiations just as Kyiv has the upper hand in its fight suggests the trio is trying to pressure Ukrainian leaders into negotiations.

What pressure? Give concrete facts or shut up with the inflammatory rhethoric mate, no one is pressuring Ukraine with shit.

Same with a full declaration of war, and full mobilisation of the army, that's liable to turn on him extremely quickly. Putin's a monster but he's not an idiot.

Putin may be (potentially) suicidal, ok with the whole world coming down with him, but that doesnt mean the rest of the leaders are. If they've not stepped in and killed him yet, that has a chance of meaning ""Ending the world over this one unnecessary conflict"" isn't in the Kremlin's deck. They've been suggesting that for a while, not just Russia but other areas of intelligence have been too. Even when Putin was threatening the world with them, when he said he had his squad on ""Special alert"" no irregular activity were going on in ANY of his facilities. 

I understand why people are scared, we're basically facing ""Cold War 2"" but running around, inducing anxiety where there needn't be any isn't healthy and it doesn't help anything. Russia has had every opportunity to escalate the conflict, to leave nuclear craters across the world and Ukraine. Shit at one point he had control of not just 1, but 2 separate nuclear power plants. He could've easily done some damage with that, but he didn't. He used the threat of it for a while, but after he just let them get back to what they were doing.

Throughout all of this, the threat of nuclear conflict has remained low. Even when Lavrov said it was ""considerable"" it still officially remained low. Russia's toned down the bombastic threats recently, and the quiet is more nerve racking, I understand, I completely understand. But panicking will not solve anything. 

Ukraine, in the future, may end up being viewed as ""Russia's Iraq/Afghanistan"".

The ideas suggested here are: 

* Set a global price cap for russian oil (say, $80/bbl or $60/bbl) and tell everyone in the world that they can buy russian oil for that price, but if they pay any more the US will sanction them for buying russian oil (i.e., secondary sanctions)

* Establish escrow accounts in the US for 3rd country oil payments to Russia that Russia can only access for food and healthcare purchases, again enforced by secondary sanctions

In both cases, both Russia and the 3rd-country buyers would have to willingly abide by the sanctions (Russia would have to keep pumping oil, the 3rd country would have to agree to American terms). It really is a very bold policy idea: essentially an American blockade of Russian oil financing, enforceable by American sanctions.

Because Russias own troops are literally verified as having outbreaks of insubordination- there troops refusing to fight.

Plus, Russia doesn't have the supply lines and capability to produce even remotely close to their given, verifiable losses. Verifiable being, we have satellite footage where we can see actual losses. Its not just speculation - we've seen it. And Russia doesn't have the ability to produce at that scale. Ukraine losses exist, easily, sure. But they have a lot of foreign aid coming through that gives them the arms they can't produce. 

Russias only chance at anything is nuclear, and im not sure I buy that Russian top brass are all dumb enough (except in the public eye where we get their screaming and crying messages) to believe they could ever win. Sure, many other people wouldn't in a nuclear exchange (though we don't 100% know the results of all that, the nuclear winter theory isn't exactly well tested for good reason, or may be propaganda itself). But a nuclear exchange? Russia VS. NATO? And we don't know how well maintained those bombs are furthering a reduction in their potential? It's just not good. Yeah, russia goes nuclear and wipes out countries. Russia wouldn't be more than a crater after that. Thats just reality, it wouldn't survive. There is absolutely no avenue Russia 'wins' this engagement. Only way is if they go nuclear and the west doesn't respond, which im not sure is an actual option as I don't think radiation spillover will be appreciated, nor will every nuclear country agree to just let russia have thst one if they wipe out an entire country.",a3b61bdf0e4406b3770fe73a299c8e1fc2bf1321,True,False,,,,,0,1653231776,,0,{},i9kj94e,False,t3_uus9a8,False,True,t1_i9ijei1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uus9a8/there_is_no_longer_any_political_justification/i9kj94e/,1653231788,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653202976.0,

2904,[],False,,CoastSeaMountainLake,,,[],,,,text,t2_10vv34,False,False,"Agreed. My expectations would be:

- The first use of a tactical nuke would instantly shut down all trade with the west. Like, ALL of it, including natural gas. No government, even the German one, could justify pumping millions of Euros into a country that might very well become a nuclear adversary very quickly.

- Ukraine isn't a NATO member, so there would be no immediate military retaliation. Hoping for a NATO nuclear response is wishful thinking.

- However, I _would_ expect to see an instant offer of NATO troop deployments in Ukraine, which Zelenskyy would agree to. Not on the front lines, but setting up bases, support infrastructure, near major cities. So then, with NATO troops in Ukraine, a _second_ nuke would very likely be interpreted as an attack on NATO troops, and trigger article 5.

- Even if article 5 is triggered, this does not mean instant Global Thermonuclear War (tm). The NATO doctrine used to be ""Flexible Response"" last time I looked (which admittedly was some time ago).

- ""Flexible Response"" means that NATO can respond to a nuclear attack with non-nuclear means of similar magnitude. Like: ""Oh, you are using a tactical nuke? How about we are launching an operation that destroys ALL of your airfields and planes within 1000km?""

- If Russia was to use a strategic nuke to level a major city, all bets are off. The casualties would be off the charts.

- So basically: The first nuke is free, but the future prosperity of Russia would be destroyed for multiple generations. The second nuke will make NATO troops active participants in the war.

- There is also the option that individual NATO countries will supply a security guarantee to Ukraine after the first nuke, outside of NATO involvement. The one thing that I am pretty sure of, is that Russia using a nuke will elicit a dramatic response of _some_ kind.",213991ca1c80aab1f7c28ae6d7698ca6a27b1024,True,False,,,,,0,1653231729,,0,{},i9kj5f6,False,t3_uv4nb3,False,True,t1_i9jd1ie,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv4nb3/sen_mitt_romney_suggests_nato_could_engage_in/i9kj5f6/,1653231742,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653202929.0,

For all his talk of not taking 'informational sedatives' his public writing on Gazeta.ru and his Telegram channel (polkovnik_hodarenok) is entirely that. It's all pro-Russian propaganda. Either he's poking fun at Ukraine receiving old and obsolete weapons (but when Russia uses them he makes posts like ""What's wrong with the Mosin-Nagant? It's a quite good rifle""), or if he admits the weapons to be good (e.g. the M777s) he thinks Russia will destroy them before reaching the front, so they don't matter anyway. Mostly he tries to discredit Ukrainian propaganda, often on weak grounds (""Those are destroyed BMP-1s, we don't use those anymore, only Ukraine does!"" - even though Russia obviously does use them)

It's embarrassing that so many supposedly serious media outlets just looked at one clip of him saying some common-sense stuff and decided he's a rational critic. Sure, he's less delusional than most people on ""60 минут"" but god knows that's not saying much..

The variant of hypersonic missile Russia and China have been publicising have been in US arsenals for many years. 

I am not from the USA, just want to point out that you seem confused on what the US recently tested and succeeded in finally using.

Essentially Russia is well behind the game. This doesn't actually matter though. As you've seen, hypersonic missles don't win wars. 

It's a good question though, how much is Ukraine willing to endure to capture Crimea? Ultimately though, if they decide to proceed, Russia will continue to prop up the Ruble until their financial reserves are exhausted. Eventually Russia will be in massive economic turmoil, piles of dead Russian men (although at 19 they are still children), swathes of hardware destroyed, droves of educated Russians fleeing, questionable ability to sustain geopolitical cohersion (is that you I hear; Georgia, Chechi, Belarus, Moldova?) and weakened Russia-China co-operation. 

Russia must realise this is the cheapest war the west has ever ""fought"", no coalition soldiers dying, replacing their own military allies stocks with competent weapon systems and 1 of their 2 biggest geopolitical threats oppressed for the next 1-2 decades. This is all achieved with probably 5% of their military budget per annum. 

Let's not even mention the potential implications for Putin as the Russian society tastes his failure. 

Look I am just an arm chair general... but atleast my local McDonald's is still open. 

The Ukrainians will suffer, but that's Russia's fault. Now Russia will feel the wrath of the Ukranian people and the world will support them, because evil can not be allowed to flourish.

Probably. But I don't want to push it.

&gt;If russia loses the war they will just lie to their people and say they won.

They could have done that already. They could simply proposed to have UN peacekeepers in Donbas and then withdraw entirely. If they did that just before they withdrew from the Kiev region they might not even have needed to include Crimea. Now they might have to agree to peacekeepers in both Donbas and Crimea and withdraw from both. 

Then they could say they ""FORCED"" Ukraine to agree to peacekeepers, declare that they had protected Russians in those area, and therefore they won. Done! Easy peasy.

I can NOT be the only person who thought about this solution, somebody involved in negotiations must have had similar ideas. So why didn't that happen?

Because this isn't about how it looks like to Russians. PUTIN would know that he actually lost. So that's unacceptable to him.

In his world he really is better than everyone else, he is completely unable of making mistakes, basically, he is a god. Failure is unacceptable unless it can be blamed on somebody else, and if you destroy the world, then you kinda won.

These kinds of leaders, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mugabe, Idi Amin, Putin they are all like this. Hitler continued the war LONG after it was absolutely obvious he could not win. Japan's leadership declared they would fight until every single Japanese person was dead, etc, etc. Death is preferable to failure, and the more people you bring with you in death, the better.

So there are three possible outcomes:

1. Putin can pretend he won.
2. Putin is removed from power.
3. Nuclear war. 

That's it, those are the options. We can't remove Putin from power, so all we can do is prevent him from winning until he either dies of natural causes or is assassinated by the military. That's the strategy here. Because we don't want to push Russia towards only having the nuclear war option, because we can't be sure that the military would stop Putin.

Litium ion is at about 0.25

Also, as said, with kerosene you get lighter during the flight, so the average weight is about half.

So, batteries need to get better by about factor 100. Ok, 50, gas turbines aren't too efficient, but if you switch to electric drive you also need to power some other stuff (like the ac) separately which offsets that a bit. . 

Also, let's do a bit of math. Hope I don't do too many mistakes. 
A 747 has a tank volume of 170.000l kerosene, thats 1.7million kwh of energy. Now, turnaround times for airplanes are 1.5h tops.

Let's assume again you only need half for electric planes and an hour actual charge time. Thats  a 850MW charger we're looking at. You need one latest - gen nuclear plant for every two planes you want to charge at the same time.

That's just not feasible.
So, no batteries for large jets in the near future, back to liquid/gaseous fuels.

Then were at the point where we can rebuild the whole infrastructure and scrap most planes and use h2... Or we add an extra step to the fuel production and combine h2 with co2 and energy to get carbon neutral kerosene.

I think, that solution to this could be simple. A solution, which would render propoganda inefective WITHOUT censorship. I think that YT (and twitter, fb etc) should put a warning label on videos and commenters, which spread propoganda and/or engage in psyhological warfare (like rusbots and wumaos do).

*****
&gt; Several U.S. media outlets claim that the U.S. wants to assist Ukraine with modern anti-ship missiles to counter the Russian naval blockade, either directly or through a European ally that can facilitate the transfer.

&gt; While reports suggest that there may be some technical challenges in deploying Harpoon missiles to Ukraine&amp;#039;s coasts, because Harpoon is mostly used at sea, it is well known that the United States Naval Air Systems Command has awarded Boeing a $498 million Harpoon Coastal Defense System contract for Taiwan in March 2022.

&gt; Although difficulties in training personnel about the Harpoon Weapon System in terms of tactical use of the missile and maintenance may be considered, technical challenges in deploying land-based Harpoon Systems do not appear convincing.

*****
&gt; Concern is mounting over Ukrainian fighters who became Russia&amp;#039;s prisoners after a brutal three-month siege in Mariupol.

&gt; Russian forces have claimed full control of the Azovstal steel plant, which was the final stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol for weeks.

&gt; The Russian defence ministry released video footage of Ukrainian soldiers being detained after announcing that its forces had removed the last holdouts from the steel plant&amp;#039;s miles of underground tunnels.

There’s protocols in place that call for an automatic attack in **any** case of a detected launch, not only against nuclear powers. That’s because in the time it takes to find out the target it may already be to late, and it could be changing trajectory mid flight.
It would require soldiers refusing their orders (which they are informed of and will, don’t worry) to stop it. If not, mutual annihilation is unavoidable.

There’s a reason why no nuclear weapons were used in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan (SU invasion) or any other proxy conflict. All mentioned ones would have been prime targets.

The only possible way around it is dropping by plane. Something like a low-yield tactical nuclear device could be used, but I personally believe the risk would far outweigh the gain. Your own troops could not be supplied either. It would just effectively make a large no man’s land no side could cross or be easily beaten back by counter attacks. Like a larger scale WW1.

Norway is probably one of the richest countries on earth. A net earner. By joining EU they would increase their tax burden while getting nothing in return.

Norway will never join under the current power structure.

You still are only commenting my post, however I have yet to find an argument that disproves my comment. 

EU is great for poorer countries, for it brings ""free money from EU"" and ""access to the market"". EU would be great for Ukraine for about 12 years, and should be treated as a trial membership. After that, the membership should be canceled.

One day European Union, as an organization, will fall apart, as no organization or political alliances are forever. I hope that the lessons will be learned from that.

They just make things up. They say the Ukrainians did bucha to themselves. They destroy an entire city with indiscriminate artillery and deliberately target hospitals etc and they just blame the Ukrainians.

But for all his talk of not taking 'informational sedatives' his public writing on Gazeta.ru and his Telegram channel is entirely that. It's all pro-Russian propaganda. Either he's poking fun at Ukraine receiving old and obsolete weapons (but when Russia does he makes posts like ""What's wrong with the Mosin-Nagant? It's a quite good rifle""), or if he admits the weapons to be good (e.g. the M777s) he thinks Russia will destroy them before reaching the front anyway. Mostly he tries to discredit Ukrainian propaganda, often on weak grounds (""Those are destroyed BMP-1s, we don't use those anymore, only Ukraine does!"" - even though they obviously do)

It's embarrassing that so many supposedly serious media outlets just looked at one clip of him saying some common-sense stuff and decided he's a rational critic. Sure, he's less delusional than most people on ""60 минут"" but god knows that's not saying much..

Also, it's fucking retarded(R word used cause it's warranted here) to believe what your enemy says regarding nuclear war. I get that Americans like to live in delusion that all Russians are dumb as fuck, but they're not that dumb. 

Before both countries adapted mutually assured destruction, there were many attempts to create treaty conditions where both country agree to only using nukes on most targets and all. They don't work because they don't trust each other to comply.

And, nuclear wars are started when the losing side in traditional warfare gets desperate. So, US either beats Russia and Russia nukes first in desperation, or US beats russia and when they get too desperate US nukes preemptively. In both cases, you get nuclear war.

US and Russia fighting for each other's territory inevitably results in nuclear war. We have known this since cold war. That's the whole fucking reason the war remained cold and proxy wars came into picture.

On the morning of Sunday, May 22, in the temporarily seized Energodar of the Zaporizhia region, local guerrillas set off an explosion in the house where the ""head of the military administration"" of the occupiers - collaborator Andriy Shevchyk - lives.

This was announced by the mayor of Energodar Dmitry Orlov.

The explosion took place in a house on Kurchatov Street. It is reported that 48-year-old Andriy Shevchyk lives there. He was a deputy from the ""OPZZH"", and then sided with the occupiers and created a ""people's council"".

""All the circumstances of the incident are being clarified, but we have accurate confirmation that the self-proclaimed head of the People's Administration Shevchyk and his bodyguards were injured in the blast. They were hospitalized with injuries of varying severity,"" he said.

Orlov stressed that none of the residents of the entrance was injured during the explosion. 

""From this we can make an obvious conclusion that we were waiting for the collaborator and hit accurately and aimfully,"" Orlov added.

According to an UNIAN correspondent, the Russians  abducted  the chief of the fire and rescue detachment in occupied Energodar.

Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe.  
  
Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the crude explosive, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin’s military.  
  
Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European warnings that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing.  
  
Barrel bombs – crude explosives packed in to a drum and dropped from a helicopter – were used to devastating effect throughout the Syrian war. The regime was also regularly accused of filling canisters with chlorine and dropping them on opposition held towns and cities, causing hundreds of deaths and sparking widespread alarm.  
  
With no anti-aircraft weapons, the anti-Assad opposition had little to counter the Syrian military’s air supremacy, which was a big factor in the regime clawing back parts of the country after 10 years of war.  
  
The situation is very different in Ukraine, however, where Ukrainian troops armed with lethal ground to air missiles can bring down Russian jets and helicopters, stalling advances and exposing ground forces to withering artillery fire.  
  
“This is probably why we haven’t seen them cross the border,” said one European official. “We know the capacity is there, but if they use it, they lose; we will know who’s done it, and they will likely be killed anyway.”  
  
The barrel bomb specialists were at the vanguard of the forces the Syrian government sent to Russia to support Putin, whose backing had been instrumental in securing Assad regime’s grip on power.  
  
The officials believe between 800 and 1,000 Syrian troops have so far volunteered to travel to Russia, where the Kremlin has promised them salaries of between $1,500-$4,000 – up to 20 times the amounts they would receive in Syria, where an economic collapse has ravaged the local currency’s value.  
  
The Syrian government has established four main recruiting centres for the Russian deployment, in Damascus, Latakia, Hama and Homs. Recruits are deployed under contract with the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organisation, which has played a leading role in hiring mercenaries to support Russia’s foreign adventures.  
  
Wagner has been prominent in Libya and eastern Syria supporting Russia’s interests. However, it has sometimes had a frayed relationship with the Kremlin. In early 2018, its forces were engaged in a brutal battle with US and Kurdish forces in the Syrian province of Deir Azzour, in which more than 140 mercenaries were killed, mainly by US artillery. European officials say that the Russian government had given a green light for the attack.  
  
“It seems they had gotten too big for their boots,” an official said. “We know for a fact that the Kremlin cut them loose.”  
  
Ever since though, Wagner has been central to Russia’s actions. Its forces were among the first deployed into Ukraine and are accused of committing atrocities in Bucha, where up to 1,000 people were massacred over a few days in early April.  
  
A relative of a Syrian army lieutenant who signed up to fight in Ukraine denied his uncle was a mercenary. “They are going there as a regular army unit,” he said. “He is traveling with a full platoon. Only four of them didn’t want to go. Putin did a lot for us, and we can help him now.”  
  
In late April, the Ukrainian government claimed that up to 25 Libyan or Syrian fighters had been killed in the town of Popasna, though this was denied by both Syrian officials and opposition members.  
  
“I asked my uncle that,” said the relative who refused to be named. “He said it’s not them, but it might be Libyans. He insists that not one of them has crossed the border.”

Which is a possible scenario. Outside of a full article 5 mobilization NATO member countries are still free to engage in whatever war they want, but they have to convince others to join them on it. And in said situation thing get muddy pretty damn quick. 

 I.e. when the US went to war in Iraq, they had to convince a select coalition of other nations to join them. If Iraq had responded by attacking America, there is a lot of debate about how NATO would have responded, since after all America was an aggressor in said scenario. 

Regardless, it's possible that naval doctrine won't even involve our carrier groups in the Black Sea. Could put them in too great of risk from nuclear anti-ship missiles or torpedoes. 

One way or another we would decimate Russia's forces in Ukraine. But It can easily escalate beyond that, not that we would have a choice at that point. Like others pointed out, you can't allow a nuclear bully free reign. 

On a final note I can't imagine Turkey not getting involved regardless of how it played out.",e65a8393c776a2abb25a82858d427bf3d6b7e042,True,False,,,,,0,1653222653,,0,{},i9k1if3,False,t3_uv4nb3,False,True,t1_i9jypls,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv4nb3/sen_mitt_romney_suggests_nato_could_engage_in/i9k1if3/,1653222667,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653193853.0,

The Soviet Union lost like 8 million soldiers in WW2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union ), and that war was defining for the Russian identity, how they wage war and how they win them. 30k indeed is a disappointing special operation, but nothing which will invoke the feeling in Russians that they have lost a big chunk of their army. Six figure losses might be needed for that.

1) this doesn’t say “will not and cannot” (I’m quoting you from above) which is what I was responding to.
2) it specifies a “decisive military victory”….so….your latest comment is also inaccurate; if you are not open to think about all ways of ending this war….shame on you, people are fucking dying. And that sucks. 
3) regarding it being an un-winnable war…this is an opinion about something incredibly uncertain. But it’s worth having discussions like this to foster dialogue about what should be happening.
4) Plus, isn’t this even a greater reason for the US to make explicit end state goals? You are glossing over what I think the real point of the article….literally who cares if the NY Times has doubts about whether the war is winnable; the larger point is that the American public is incredibly fickle with who they support overseas.

Numerous Russian right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis have apparently joined Russia's attack on Ukraine. This emerges from a confidential report by the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), which SPIEGEL was able to see. The seven-page document was sent to several federal ministries last week.

According to the BND, the ""Russian Imperial League"" and the group ""Rusich"" are ""at least two groups with right-wing extremist sentiment"" fighting against the Ukrainian army. In addition, Moscow is using at least one right-wing extremist ""individual for its own purposes,"" according to the paper. The cooperation with these groups leads ""the alleged reason for war, the so-called 'denazification' of Ukraine, to absurdity,"" write the analysts of the German foreign intelligence service.

The document gives no information about the number of right-wing extremist fighters. However, groupings and units are named.

Accordingly, the »Russian Imperial Legion« (RIL), the paramilitary arm of the right-wing extremist group »Russian Imperial Movements«, has already intervened in the fighting. After the group had already fought on the Russian side in Ukraine's Donbass in 2014 and 2015, just a day after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, RIL boss Denis Garieyev wrote on Telegram: »There is no doubt that we are talking for the liquidation of the separatist entity Ukraine.«

After Gariev had called on the ""legionnaires"" to be patient at the beginning of March, RIL shortly afterwards announced its decision to engage in combat operations. According to the BND document, ""mainly people with military experience"" and graduates of the organization's own training center ""Partizan"" in Saint Petersburg were recruited as fighters. It is unclear ""whether this decision was made at the request of or in consultation with the Russian leadership,"" the BND analysts continue.

As the BND reports, Gariyev's deputy died in fighting in Ukraine. Gariyev himself was flown out injured, and at least two other right-wing extremists were seriously wounded.

The ""Rusich"" group is also said to be involved in the fighting. In many places it is attributed to the notorious Russian mercenary group »Wagner« and was also deployed in Donbass in 2014 and 2015.

According to the BND report, Rusich had been ""known for her particular brutality"" ever since. She had a reputation for ""never taking prisoners."" Parts of the unit would probably also have fought in Syria.

Rusich is said to have become part of the hostilities on Ukrainian territory by the beginning of April at the latest, the German secret service officials write.

One of the two Rusich founders is considered a sadist ""since he killed a puppy in an appearance on social media,"" says the document. To prove the right-wing extremist background of the organization, the BND analysts attached pictures of the Rusich founders Alexej M. and Jan P. to their report: One picture shows M. with a swastika flag, another shows P. with the Hitler salute in front of a campfire.

In addition, the right-wing extremist Alexander M. from Donetsk tried to recruit volunteers for the war via Telegram in April: it was decided to set up a battalion to support pro-Russian and Russian forces. M. himself had fought on the Russian side in Donbass in the past. He is known to a larger audience in Russia as a military correspondent for the Russian state television station »Channel One«.",df903874084565a2896458a940b99bb314c3245d,True,False,,,,,0,1653220380,,0,{},i9jy58l,True,t3_uv9d2v,False,True,t3_uv9d2v,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv9d2v/numerous_neonazis_are_fighting_for_russia_in/i9jy58l/,1653220391,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653191580.0,

Growing up in Europe in the 1980s, you'd surely know that one or other country invading East or West *Berlin* would have been enough to start a nuclear war, let alone invading hundreds of miles worth of actual Russian territory. Also in the 1980s, the major threat of initiating a nuclear strike was considered to be the USA - because the Soviet Union's conventional army was widely considered to be far superior at the time.

The media censorship of the gulf war and Iraq invasion are a fact. The US military didnt want a free media reporting like during the Vietnam war.

""The media coverage of the 1991 Gulf War was entirely different[1]. What the US citizens could see and hear in this case were materials meticulously prepared by the army personnel, showing successful actions of anti-Iraqi coalition, including direct footage from missiles launched against enemy targets. The propaganda of success was at its most efficient at the time of the Desert Storm operation. This paper will contend that the US military attitude towards the media during the Gulf War was a product of its experience in Vietnam. A number of arguments will be presented in support of this thesis. Firstly, it will be argued that Vietnam was an obvious experience to learn how to handle the media from as it was the most recent US military intervention before the Gulf. Secondly, during the Gulf War, strict censorship was imposed on the correspondents, which was in stark contrast to the situation during the Vietnam War. Thirdly, it will be demonstrated that the treatment of the media by army officials was also radically different from the style of ignorance evident during the Vietnam conflict.""

Let's look at likely consequences.  


Russia uses a nuke in Ukraine - NATO has 2 choices - to respond or not to respond. If they don't respond then Russia knows it is free to use nuclear weapons in future against any non-nuclear state *and so do all the other nuclear nations!* In fact the nations that don't have nukes will realise they absolutely NEED to have them now and it will spark a world wide rush to procure them.    


So basically NATO MUST respond... but how? If as Romney suggests, NATO goes into Ukraine and wipes out the Russian conventional forces what do you think Russia's response would be? Sit back and let it happen? They've already used one nuke - they've made the threat to use nukes against NATO if NATO gets involved. They are certainly going to use nukes against NATO forces in Ukraine and probably the surrounding bases. To this NATO must respond in kind ... it's a full on nuclear conflict.  


If Russia uses a nuke, NATO must take control of the decisions that follow, NOT Putin. That means they either do nothing and accept that Putin has called their bluff, or they launch everything in an attempt to eradicate the Russian nuclear capability - small chance of success, but the best of a set of awful options.  


My bet is they'd do nothing except announce further sanctions.",a58b43bc02bd21094911a87a672f89428e9839cd,True,False,,,,,0,1653218908,,0,{},i9jw53v,False,t3_uv4nb3,False,False,t3_uv4nb3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv4nb3/sen_mitt_romney_suggests_nato_could_engage_in/i9jw53v/,1653218919,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653190108.0,

The middle aged and especially the old ones are the problem. They grew up in Soviet and Cold War times, they draw their information mostly from state TV and they have that feeling of entitlement, Russian superiority, imperialism and a deep distrust towards the west deeply engrained in them. Putin (or any other Russian leader) has their support, and they are the majority.

Sure, if they got convinced that they have been lied to by Russian propaganda (which already is a monumental task), some of them, the more pragmatic ones, would realise the war is not worth it. But that would mostly be a form of cost benefit calculation, and not actual, moral qualms. If Russia somehow would get a top notch military in a few years a lot of those would probably sway back and support Russian aggression all the way to Lissabon.

After years and years of propaganda, indoctrination, echo chambers and that education system, I think the amount of Russians who really do believe that Russians are no better than anybody else, don't have any special rights over other people and that Russia itself as a country and culture are not only not better than the rest, but actually considerably worse. That is a hard pill to swallow and can seriously harm ones self image, and the view on the lifes they have lived so far.

As a whole I think we can write off the Russian nation as an ally. They will require a profound shock in order to  bring up the will to question their past and change their future (self).

Putin’s catastrophic war has exposed Russia as a third-rate power

May 22, 2022 - by Nani Geek - Leave a Comment

Once this decapitation strategy had failed, the Russian offensive rapidly became bogged down in Kyiv’s wooded hinterland. After a month of increasingly heavy casualties, the invaders withdrew to the border to lick their wounds.

What they left behind, however, were corpses, mass graves and other evidence of crimes against humanity. The evidence of atrocities first found in Bucha and then in almost every town or village liberated since has opened the eyes of the world to horrors that will dominate the memory of this war.

Perhaps the most brutal fighting of all has taken place in the Siege of Mariupol: an epic struggle lasting more than 80 days that culminated in a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks.

Conspicuous in this siege was the Azov Battalion or Regiment, a unit in the Ukrainian National Guard with neo-Nazi origins and insignia. The Azov plays an outsize role in Russian propaganda, in order to justify Putin’s claim that his aim is the “denazification” of Ukraine.

Yet the undeniable courage of the defenders of Mariupol, by contrast with the ruthlessness of the besieging Russians — who refused to allow civilians to leave or to treat soldiers as prisoners of war — has turned this into yet another propaganda victory for Ukraine.

The fate of Mariupol’s pre-war population of more than 400,000 is still unclear — hundreds have been deported to an area near North Korea — but at least 20,000 civilians died in this once-prosperous port, now reduced to rubble. Its name, however, will be cherished by Ukrainians because by holding out for so long, it tied up Russian forces that might otherwise have tipped the balance in the battle of Donbas which began six weeks ago.

Having damaged but failed to take the high-tech hub of Kharkiv, once the “Silicon Valley” of Ukraine, the depleted Russian hordes are now concentrating their efforts on capturing the remaining Donbas region.

The aim is to hold a rigged referendum in Kherson to add a third puppet “republic” to the separatist enclaves of Luhansk and Donetsk. However, the catastrophe that has now befallen the occupied areas of Donbas is indescribable.",8b7bc68ebee5b98392c1f1bb3f9f62a77bd9f7d9,True,False,,,,,0,1653216254,,0,{},i9jsuwy,True,t3_uv8e3v,False,True,t3_uv8e3v,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv8e3v/putins_catastrophic_war_has_exposed_russia_as_a/i9jsuwy/,1653216271,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653187454.0,

The Hitler Stalingrad Speech was an address made by Adolf Hitler to senior members of the Nazi Party on November 8, 1942. The speech took place at the Löwenbräukeller in Stiglmaierplatz in Munich during the height of the Battle of Stalingrad.

codename of the Soviet Red Army's 19–23 November 1942 strategic operation on the Eastern Front of World War II which led to the encirclement of Axis forces in the vicinity of Stalingrad: the German Sixth Army, the Third and Fourth Romanian armies, and portions of the German Fourth Panzer Army. 

The Red Army took advantage of the German army's poor preparations for winter, and the fact that its forces in the southern Soviet Union were overstretched near Stalingrad, using weaker Romanian troops to guard their flanks; the offensive's starting points were established along the section of the front directly opposite Romanian forces.

He’s not signing any treaties right now, the war is still very much raging in Russian occupied spaces, he’s not throwing in the towel. One of the biggest things that Ukraine has to consider in this situation is whether or not retaking occupied areas in the Donbas or Crimea are worth potentially exhausting their military over. The Russians were incredibly fucking stupid and committed pretty much all of their trained forces and most effective equipment to this fight and got most of it wiped out in a little over two months. That’s unfortunate for Russia and likely means that they won’t be able to wage another war of aggression for some time while they try to recover what they’ve lost. However, if Ukraine goes all in on trying to recapture areas where separatists and Russians and have been able to fortify &amp; build defenses for 8 years, and will likely have large parts of the civilian population working against them then their military is potentially facing catastrophic losses as well. No one else is going to be sending people in to bolster flagging troop numbers to retake those areas. And if Ukraine is left without reliable, trained personnel then the situation would be *much* worse for them than it is right now and could leave to door open for Russia to come back in with their million-man untrained conscript horde they keep threatening to use. Ukraine is fighting for it’s territorial integrity, yes, but it is also fighting for the future of it’s people. Completely annihilating a couple of generations of Ukrainian men and leaving themselves weakened to future invasion might not be seen as worth it in order to retake areas that have been trying to secede from Ukraine for the better part of a decade.

Most of the Ukraine war subs are pro-Ukraine, and that's to be expected as the free world is overwhelmingly pro-Ukraine, and Russia is restricting access to the outside world. Neither side is providing entirely accurate information, and that's to be expected, propaganda goes hand in hand with warfare. The Russian government hasn't released any data on Russian casualties since March, and those data claim 1,351 Russians have died. Are we to believe no Russians have died since mid March? 

So sure, on here the information is definitely very much skewed towards a pro-Ukraine perspective, that's to be expected. But we're not exactly getting reliable information from Russia either.

There is no way to get reliable real-time information from this war, what's coming out in videos etc is being heavily censored by both sides. If you rely on the western media your info is likely to be several days if not up to a week out of date because those guys like to see at least two independent reliable sources before they report.

So I think the only objective way to look at this is to take everything you hear that's real time (ie within three old) with a grain of salt, sometimes it's going to be accurate, often it's not.

This is a sentence that is meant to add to the discussion, but actually says basically nothing that is not 100% obvious and generic.

No, but it does need to be smart about it.  Moreover, it is in Ukraine's interest to conform to western norms if they want to join western bodies such as the EU and NATO.

Also they don't behave like people expect. Often they take opposing positions on a topic, often not even the pro-Russian position. They are often trying to put wedges into divisions which there are already in Western societies (which might or not might be related to Russia at all), or just divert from particular topics and stop debates about them, etc., more often than pushing pro-Kremln talking points.

If you are able to look at it from the outside you'll understand how the capitalist way of thinking is just as pervasive as communism. To put it bluntly, if you were growing in a Nazi environment, you would probably see it as the norm. 

Media control. Do I really have to explain this point?
Again, oversimplifying: do you think that privately owned media, where the owners are always the richest elite, is a free media? 
Examples of my country, Italy. 
The biggest editorial group GEDI, owned by Agnelli, owners of FIAT/Chrysler. They also own armaments factories, and their media outlets push for sending weapons to Ukraine and bashes pacifists.
Formerly prime minister Berlusconi, owner of 3 national television channels, many daily journals and an empire built through his connection to the mafia supported by the CIA against left wing parties. 
This is all supported by evidence in trials. 
We have had for at least 50 years a division of CIA who had journalists on their payroll through offshore societies aimed at controlling media against left wing parties. And this same thing happened all over western Europe. Oh maybe I have to mention that the most famous antimafia judges were blown up in two different attacks in 1992 as they were investigating the link between mafia, Italian government and CIA, and a CIA operative was among the ones who pushed the switch to activate the explosives. I could go on for 1000 pages. So, free media? 

About the violence, again it's a long list. 
I can't go in depth so I will just mention some and you can do your own research on Wikipedia. 
And I suggest you read the book about NATO stay-behind operations by the historian Daniele Ganser. 
Mossadeq in Iran. Years of lead in Italy. The many South America coups. Arming Afghans islamists against Russia. Arming Chechen against Russia again. In recent years, Venezuela and the attempted Guaido coup. 2014 maidan coup in Ukraine.

&gt;  
&gt;You claimed „many nations“ have sent non-Soviet tanks and AA systems, yet you can’t name any beyond maybe Stormers.

I never claimed nations had sent non soviet tanks or AA systems. I merely stated many countries had sent heavy equipment, you decided that should exclusively be tanks and AA. Once again mis-quoting and mis-representing what I said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm not saying Germany didnt send alot of small arms, but that was only really relevant at the beginning of the war when there was an expectation that the war would devolve into an insurgency. Now things have changed and the aid needs to change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Has Russia suddenly changed to a strategy based on air supremacy? Cause honestly I don’t see that, it’s still tanks, artillery and boots on the ground.

The only reason Russia DOESN'T have air supremacy is because of these systems, and partners like Poland and the US providing the Ukranian airforce with more helicopters and spare parts for their fighters. Without them it would be just like the Donbas in 2014 where Russian air power decimated the Ukranian military. The fact you make this statement shows how little you actually know about this conflict tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not really a Myth though is it? When was the last package of arms delivered by Berlin?  
&gt;  
&gt;No clue, but let me repeat myself, fourth largest donor.

Let me repeat myself, fourth largest in line items not battlefield impact or usefulness

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not about just trade. It is a well accepted phenomenon that Germany has a soft attitutude towards Russia. Theres even a name for it ""Putinversteher"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany tried to find a diplomatic solution. That failed, but I think it’s a good thing to try and prevent tens of thousands of deaths.

The sad reality is, that whilst I welcome the idea of nobody dying you simply cannot actually really negotiate with Russia.

&gt;I am sure things like an ex chancellor being on the board of a major Russian energy company is just coincidence. The fact that the guy has now lost part of his state priviledges should tell you that something is afoot there also.  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s „afoot“? A guy who lost power 17 years ago is a piece of shit. End of story.

He sure is. Not hard to see the foundations laid by him have been carried forward by Merkel and now Scholz. You don't get a call from Putin and offered a job unless you do something for him.

Russian tactical nukes will aim at priority military threats in Europe and possibly Asia (airports, armies, fleets, nuclear facilities etc.). The USA will avoid this first wave, it would be aimed against Europe, especially against Eastern and Central part.

Then comes the second wave, strategic nukes. This one directly aims at any nuclear capabilities of your opponent, but would be also extremely deadly for civilians. UK, France and USA are priority targets.

Third wave would be launching whatever's left at that point against capital cities, economic centers, harbors etc. The goal is to obliterate anything that will allow your counterparty to recover. That goes for both America and Europe.

All this would happen in one hour max. The difference between America (USA+Canada) and Europe is that America is relatively large, and ""a lot of people"" would be able to survive because of it.

Supply and demand on foreign currency - when your import from all countries drops by 70%+, you just don't need the foreign currency, so it becomes cheaper. Also, the European nations never agreed to buy anything in rubles. They are still transferring USD to Russia as payment, but via a convoluted scheme Russia came up with to avoid this money getting stuck on frozen accounts.

Also, the Russian ruble is no longer a convertible currency, so it doesn't really matter what price the Russian Central Bank puts on it. The USSR currency also had an official exchange rate that was completely meaningless.

There were additional ingredients such as the 1929 stock market crash without which Hitler likely would never have been able to rise as high as he did.

I think that the introduction of real actual democracy in Russia as well as elsewhere has to start at the grassroots level. Let it build slowly upwards, partially replacing a technocratic management structure put in place exclusively on merit and kept in check by chartered accountants. When democrarically elected political leadership are introduced at the local, regional, provincial and national levels step-by-step, the technocrats take a step back into a civil servant position.

The problem is with the president. With a technocratic government this is mostly a ceremonial position, and the question is if this is not the best solution.

NATO is explicitly a military alliance, so when weighting potential memberships, it becomes important to account how much of a liability the applicants are. How likely are they to draw rest of the pact in a war. Finland has not been to war in 80 years now while Sweden has not been in over 100 years. Turkey on the other hand never really enjoyed prolonged period of stability after WW1 and has been involved in multiple conflicts both internally and elsewhere including violent coups / attempted coups. Most recently in 2016.

Turkey joining NATO was a feel good story about west making allies in east. With western involvement in Iraq and Syria coming to end their value as host for bases becomes less important in contrast to how much of a liability they are.",4b25d84e6818bab2dca0793c536aa95fa82e0295,True,False,,,,,0,1653210567,,0,{},i9jmjxc,False,t3_uuvp2p,False,True,t1_i9j07ud,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uuvp2p/erdogan_sets_conditions_for_sweden_finland_nato/i9jmjxc/,1653210582,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653181767.0,

The irony of that statement is that pretty much the entire world and half the population of the US knew what would happen and told the US government and the right multiple times. Millions of people protested knowing EXACTLY what would happen but those in power didn't listen. Republican adventurism and profit won the day.


&gt;It’s easy to look back with retrospect but, we are talking about Putin and Russia the same way they spoke about the USSR back them, they’re an existential threat to democracy. I find hypocrisy in people supporting arming Ukraine but pretending they would’ve known at the time that Vietnam / Iraq were a bad idea

This isn't even remotely accurate. There's no similarity between any of these conflicts and what's happening in Ukraine. If anything the US played the role of the russians in this conflict, in vietnam. It ignored the popular direction of the country and propped up pretenders. It bombed the country into the stone age, it massacred tens of thousands of ordinary people, destroyed everything, wrecked cambodia for decades just to add to it. Soldiers even raped and murdered civilians on many occasions. Vietnam was the loss of the US soul, which took decades to get back. 

The Ukraine war is simple by comparison, and it's only thanks to ongoing US soul searching that it can be part of this with a reasonable conscience.",cdeaf0e05b3260400337f9e8549e3584f880acd9,True,False,,,,,0,1653210389,,0,{},i9jmd0u,False,t3_uuuubu,False,True,t1_i9jkqlm,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uuuubu/the_defence_of_mariupol_seems_to_be_unprecedented/i9jmd0u/,1653210401,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653181589.0,

&gt; As the West rallies behind Ukraine, Polish President Andrzej Duda arrived in Ukraine on an unannounced visit and will address the country&amp;#039;s parliament on Sunday, his office said.

&gt; With Russia blocking Ukraine&amp;#039;s sea ports, Poland has become a major gateway for Western humanitarian aid and weapons going into Ukraine and has been helping Ukraine get its grain and other agricultural products to world markets.

&gt; Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported Saturday that Russia destroyed a Ukrainian special-operations base near Odesa, Ukraine&amp;#039;s main Black Sea port, as well as a significant cache of Western-supplied weapons in northern Ukraine&amp;#039;s Zhytomyr region.

&gt; Belarusians are among those who have answered a call by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for foreign fighters to go to Ukraine and join the International Legion for the Territorial Defense of Ukraine.

&gt; Russian troops used Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine early in the war, and Lukashenko has publicly stood by longtime ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, describing him as his &amp;quot;Big brother.&amp;quot; Russia, for its part, has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up Lukashenko&amp;#039;s Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans.

&gt; For many of the Belarusians, their base is Poland, a country along NATO&amp;#039;s eastern flank that borders Belarus and Ukraine and which became a haven for pro-democracy Belarusian dissidents before becoming one for war refugees from Ukraine.

As for the ""very few exceptions"" part about France being very willing to be occupied by Germany,  you should just educate yourself tbh. 25 years before 1940, France hosted the biggest war the world had known. A huge part of the homeland was turned into a burnt no man's land, and in the battle of Verdun, the French army suffered 400 000 casualties (163 000 killed). In a single battle. The whole war costed millions of lives. To this day, you can go to any French village and find the monument near the church with dozens of names. Those are people killed in WW1. In my grandparents village, a family has 18 names on it. Do you really think they were ""fine with very few exceptions"" when they lost to Germany 20 years later?",111a9d5e6c99f859c6854cd4d886b3590f34325e,True,False,,,,,0,1653209860,,0,{},i9jls1x,False,t3_uupm0b,False,False,t1_i9hnhgh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uupm0b/amazingly_the_appeasers_macron_scholz_dragi/i9jls1x/,1653209872,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653181060.0,

The main argument isn't neccessarily how many M777 Howitzers Ukraine has in the field at this moment, but the fact that they are going to keep getting more, while Russia's supply of howitzers decreases over time with effective counter-battery fire. In a ironic twist of fate, Ukraine can afford to take losses in material, whereas Russia cannot, since the West (and especially the US) is pretty much bankrolling Ukraine's war effort. 

Also the Oryx website, while useful to confirm Russian losses, nonetheless lags behind, there is significant evidence to support that Russia is experiencing a shortage of capable Reconnaissance UAV's in theatre, and again, unlike Ukraine it is less capable of replacing those losses, due to the extensive economic sanctions that have been placed on Russia. This points to the Russians having suffered a high attrition rate for their UAV forces, and will lead to further degradation of their reconnaissance capabilities at the conflict progresses, also forcing them to be more selective in their use of UAV's, similar to how Ukraine adapted its use of Bayraktar drones from the early days of the conflict to its more selective usage at present due to having suffered their own high attrition rate of that platform.

You claimed „many nations“ have sent non-Soviet tanks and AA systems, yet you can’t name any beyond *maybe* Stormers.

&gt; I'm not saying Germany didnt send alot of small arms, but that was only really relevant at the beginning of the war when there was an expectation that the war would devolve into an insurgency. Now things have changed and the aid needs to change.

Has Russia suddenly changed to a strategy based on air supremacy? Cause honestly I don’t see that, it’s still tanks, artillery and boots on the ground. 

&gt; Not really a Myth though is it? When was the last package of arms delivered by Berlin?

No clue, but let me repeat myself, fourth largest donor. 

&gt; It's not about just trade. It is a well accepted phenomenon that Germany has a soft attitutude towards Russia. Theres even a name for it ""Putinversteher"". 

Germany tried to find a diplomatic solution. That failed, but I think it’s a good thing to try and prevent tens of thousands of deaths. 

&gt; I am sure things like an ex chancellor being on the board of a major Russian energy company is just coincidence. The fact that the guy has now lost part of his state priviledges should tell you that something is afoot there also.

What’s „afoot“? A guy who lost power 17 years ago is a piece of shit. End of story.

&gt; Germany has endorsed an oil embargo which also giving permission for their energy companies to open Rouble accounts, to allow the conversion of the Euro payments into Roubles, which circumvents and undermines any sort of sanctions or embargo.

&gt; Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv.On 10 May, Belarus&amp;#039;s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a &amp;quot;Southern threat&amp;quot; from Ukraine and Nato.

&gt; Belarus has been conducting military drills its border with Ukraine since early May.Belarusian President, Aleksandr Lukashenko, has been Russia&amp;#039;s closest ally in its war in Ukraine.

&gt; In their analysis of the threat from Belarus, the UK&amp;#039;s Ministry of Defence said last week that the presence of Belarusian forces on the border would probably prevent Ukraine from deploying support operations on its Donbas front.

There is another prong to the analysis: Egypt has a long standing very sizable military relationship with the U.S. The Arab Spring saw the fall of Egypt's traditional military government (Israel-neutral, pro-West) in favor of the election of the Muslim Brotherhood (Islamist, anti-West). That government tried to unilaterally draft and eventually impose a new constitution on Egypt (that presumably would have been theocratic). The (U.S. funded) military removed that government from power following mass protests, and the current government resembles the traditional one.

The idea of Egypt's (current and historical) government condemning the U.S. on behalf of a non-local, non-critical, third government is farfetched, to say the least.

However I will say that prior to the vote in his country Macron had some moronic right wing takes with the clear goal to snatch victory from Le Pen and directly after it he has been very much pro Ukraine again. I think he realised that Le Pen in power could have been the nail in the coffin for the EU as a whole so he threw everything against it.

Scholz had an absolute moronic first response probably due to fear of a nuclear attack as Germany would 100% be a target before alot of other countries. However most dumb takes from our politicians have stopped for a month+ now and they are very clearly pro Ukraine recognised borders now.


Overall this is the first war in along time that directly affects Europe so alot of people were simply afraid. Politicians are probably still human. I assume Americas response is much easier as they have a massive water mass between them and the conflict. Like no one blames India for being pro Russian due to how close they are to them either.

&gt;Underestimating embodied knowledge creates a blind spot that leads to the West’s nonurgent response of pacifism and peace negotiations, while people of Ukraine insist on being given more military aid instead.  

What response of pacifism is she talking about? What does she mean with ""nonurgent""? AFAIK this was the fastest response the EU ever delivered.  

&gt;This is exactly where ‘westplaining’, a toxic tendency of Western experts to ignore local knowledge while explaining Eastern European contexts, fails in its arrogance and privilege.  

Citations needed.  

&gt; The construction of the myth of ‘great Russian culture’ is an example of this tendency, cultivated through syllabi and research publications, in which Russian authors often exist as if slightly suspended from the context of imperialism.

&gt; Russia’s war against Ukraine, just like other struggles of people around the world, is not something that happens far away, to the ‘others’ we study, or in the texts we read.

In the not so distant past, the US and its NATO allies fought a Cold War with the Soviet Union that lead to it’s breakup freeing Ukraine along with the other countries in the eastern bloc. 

Fast forward to today, Biden just signed a bill for $40 Billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Before that he was warning the world of imminent Russian invasion while threatening Putin of severe repercussions if he invaded as seemed likely and then rallied the rest of the world to make good on those threats. The west along with most of the UN member countries loudly condemned Russia, kicked them out of the worldwide financial markets, ended trade with them to completely destroy Russia’s entire economy crippling their ability to pay for their ongoing invasion of Ukraine. 

If not for Biden and NATO, Ukraine would be part of Russia already! And that’s not enough? 

The US &amp; NATO risks nuclear WW3 with an unstable autocrat in order to support a nascent democracy. And that’s not good enough?!?! 

Oh but that’s not good enough, you want all the people of the west to ignore their own problems like double digit inflation, unaffordable housing/gas/healthcare/food, crashing markets and stagnant wages to only care about a country most couldn’t find on a map?

Can Russia replace those systems faster than Ukraine?

&gt;They can no longer repair aircraft or tanks. That's why they are sending tanks to slovakia and aircraft to Piland.

Would they *need* to?  If they're able to get damaged equipment out of the country, presumably they can get *repaired* equipment back in.  So what's the point here?

&gt;No other EU country is willing to give up their soviet aircraft or armoured vehicles and none are being produced.

What about equipment not created in a country that hasn't existed for 30 years?

“While there are deep partisan divides in views of the administration’s response to the crisis, views on U.S. support to Ukraine are less divided.

Gathered the main news for the night of May 22.


**""Voluntary Squads"" in Mariupol**

In the temporarily occupied Mariupol, the Russian occupiers are creating so-called volunteer squads to patrol the city with the Russian military and the DNR People's Militia.

The real purpose of this is probably to intensify ""search operations"": the occupiers are beginning to look not only for activists, but also for public utilities, teachers and other professionals. Also in this way, the Russians are making ""soft"" preparations for mobilization.

**Zelensky on the situation in Donbass**

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the situation in eastern Ukraine remains extremely difficult as Russian troops try to attack Slavyansk and Severodonetsk. According to him, during May 21, the military situation did not change significantly, but ""it was really difficult.""

**Destruction of the bridge in Luhansk region**

In the Luhansk region, on May 21, the Russian occupiers destroyed the Pavlograd Bridge, which connected Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. This will significantly complicate the evacuation and delivery of humanitarian goods. However, there is a connection between the cities.

The head of the OVA said that  ""they have already taken revenge for the bridge"" : the National Guard destroyed enemy equipment that destroyed the Pavlograd bridge on May 21 and shelled Severodonetsk.

**Successes of partisans in Zaporozhye**

Zaporizhzhya OVA reported that the Defense Forces of the Zaporizhzhya Territory, together with representatives of the Resistance Movement, were destroying equipment of the Russian occupiers.

Thus, near Melitopol, the occupiers' radar stations were destroyed, which cut off communications and conducted reconnaissance. In addition, thanks to concerted action with the guerrillas, Ukrainian riflemen destroyed several artillery systems of the Russian army.

**New bodies found in Kyiv region**

The bodies of two other civilians killed by the Russian military were found in the Bucha district of Kyiv region : an elderly woman was killed in a shelling in her own yard in late February, and her 27-year-old grandson was killed by occupiers in early March.

Kyiv Region Police have already identified and inspected 1,290 bodies of people who died during hostilities in the region. Law enforcement officers continue to investigate the war crimes of the occupiers.

**The occupiers moved a civilian car**

In the temporarily occupied Melitopol of the Zaporozhye region, the Russian occupiers, ""having fun"" on the road, moved a car, as a result of which the water was trapped in the cabin. Now the victim is in hospital.

**Destroyed ""Sunsepeki"", ""Hyacinth"" and ""Peony""**

During May 21, the strike aircraft of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces destroyed at least 12 units of military equipment of the occupiers, including two heavy flamethrower systems such as Solntsepek.

And the defenders of the south covered the checkpoint of the occupiers in the Kherson region with fire, as a result of which the enemy lost control of the units. Ukrainian fighters also destroyed a large-caliber Hyacinth gun, a Peony self-propelled gun and other enemy equipment.

**Detention in Latvia**

Latvian law enforcement officers detained in Riga a man who on May 20 after the action ""For liberation from the Soviet heritage"" inflicted bodily injuries on a young man with a Ukrainian flag. Now the perpetrator faces up to 5 years in prison. Law enforcement officers must assess whether the crime is related to incitement to national, ethnic or social hatred.

The American Institute for War Studies (ISW) suggests that Russian occupation forces may be preparing for an offensive in southern Ukraine to capture the rest of the Kherson region and advance toward Zaporizhia.",5bed3e8edcb511db56276f768ea4c7f6e4764c38,True,False,,,,,0,1653199212,,0,{},i9j9nsv,True,t3_uv4qqt,False,True,t3_uv4qqt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv4qqt/successes_of_partisans_in_zaporizhia_and_creation/i9j9nsv/,1653199222,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653170412.0,

Ukraine has a lot more men, but this is less of an advantage than it seems. These troops are very raw, sure they can use a gun and dig a trench and take orders.

So what do you do with them, of course they can be put in less lethal roles, but there is a limit to those. It took the British over 18 months to take volunteers into useable soldiers in WW2.

An artillery mis-match in effective range, is not something they can plan around. Even without these special rounds, the effective range of the M777 is better than Russian artillery. 


This war has essentially become an artillery war. The side that can put more shells at the enemy from further away will have a major advantage. 


&amp;nbsp;




&gt;I’m confused why my downvoters think that Howitzers are going to be the end all be all of the Russian invasion?

Them having better artillery will be a HUGE factor. Probably even the single biggest one. There isn't anything Russia can really do about this artillery mis-match. You say they can plan, what plan do you think they could make? They have no major air operation capabilities. They can't get air superiority, they definitely can't do shit with their tanks. What will Russia do knowing that Excalibur rounds are in the field of combat? 



&amp;nbsp;

The impact this has on morale has the potential to be far more detrimental than any other potential outcome from Russia knowing about these Excalibur rounds. Think of all the Russian artillery crews, who will know that the range of their guns doesn't go nearly as far as their enemies? That shit will not be good for morale. 



&amp;nbsp;


This is why a lot of weapons get announced like this.

If you say ""We will give this region greater autonomy"", that usually falls along the lines of ""Here, we usually control these taxes and the budget for road maintenance - now you can decide for yourself how those taxes get spent/what roads get fixed or how it gets approached"". 

This has a few positives, at the cost of not being able to negotiate with the full government behind you - specifically concerning issues that affect locals differently to the rest of the population. For example, the UK gives a significant amount of autonomy to the countries under its banner - it allows Wales, N Ireland and Scotland to enact local laws for their own citizens. If I follow on that road example, it lets them ignore the ""national"" signage rules regarding English signs and mandate that all signs must be in English and Welsh - or to mandate that Irish must be taught in schools, despite Westminster not making it a nation-wide law.

It represents a decentralised approach to government over an area, not a transfer of territory or allegiance.

The TDF unit was not able to hold it's position in Prylipka and the bridge just west of the city over the river.   It may be given how close this is to Rubizhne that the author is generalizing the location.  Rubizhne along with Ternova, Vesele and some illages further west were subject of Russian shelling but I believe they are all still ""nominally"" in Ukraine hands.

It should be noted its not like there is a solid line of troops from each side facing off against each other vs say the Donbas lines.  Ukraine pushes and patrols but to my best knowledge they are not garrisoning most of these very small towns although they did have a presence in Rubizhne.  I could imagine they might have a presence in Ternova but I have not read anything to that effect either way.

I would suggest it is a dynamic situation.  Since quite a bit of the Ukrainian presence is TDF they are patrolling and assisting the local population.  My understanding is Russian forces are rather on the light side as well but they do have a notable artillery presence on their side of the border.   Artillery barrages will constantly raise a fear of attack, which it is suggested is exactly the outcome Russia is striving to obtain so as to stick Ukraine forces to the area.  Russia does not want Ukraine to move units around to assist say in the Donbas.

That won't help Russia as the reinforcements Ukraine is sending to the southeast are units that up to the start of the war were only partially mobilized or reserve units, and which have been busy spinning up to full capacity, such as the 4th Armored.

I am very rusty in North African politics, but Egypt is a big net importer of food (lots of nations are). I would guess That Russia promised Egypt that the war would be over soon when Egypt pointed out Russia was invading their food supply. That never happened, so to appease them Russia loaded a ship up with grain and sent it to an Egyptian port, likely selling it for way below market... But only if the Egyptian government came out and supported the war/denounced the West.

Normally this is an easy deal. Nations make this deal all the time. BUT these are not 'normal' times, and they are made worse by the issue that the deal doesn't actually *solve* Egypt's problem.... And honestly it isn't even a half assed band-aid. Russia assumed it would be business as usual when they threatened-then-bribed Egypt. 

But this time not only is Russia incapable of making things better, they aren't even able to make them worse. The offer was always an insulting one, but this time the threat that came with it had no teeth.

You could stand to learn the difference in English between where to put a comma and where to put a period.  Your message isn't unclear, but it's not really proper either.

To wit:  


""Crazy Russian journalist filmed the location of Russian military hardware in Ukraine, ranting the propaganda malarkey whilst he was at it.  After the video was shot, a Ukrainian missile landed on the hardware he was talking about.  Dude (sic) disclosed 'classified' information about the Russian Regime.""

or, if you want to reword things slightly

""Crazy Russian jouranlist filmed the location of Russian military hardware in Ukraine.  He ranted the propaganda malarkey whilst he was at it.  After the video was shot, a Ukrainian missile landed on the hardware he was talking about. The dude disclosed 'classified' information about the Russian Regime.""

Sentence fragments can look like complete sentences to someone not versed in English, but if a fragment exists only to help people understand the following sentence, like ""after the video was shot"" does, it should have a comma after it rather than a period, as it's part of that following sentence rather than its own thing.  

Similarly, when someone does two things, and you describe the second action with a fragment (first he ""appeared,"" then he ""ranted,"" you either need to use a pronoun for the second sentence, or combine them with a comma so it's clear that it's the guy in the subject who's doing both things.

5502,[],False,,zebsdee,,,[],,,,text,t2_9um0yw2,False,True,"&gt;Russian forces failed to capture Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and are making but fitful progress in the east, but the economic carnage of the war and Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports could pose its own existential threat if the country’s partners and multilateral institutions are unable to make up the shortfall.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Ukrainian government officials estimate the country needs an additional $5 billion each month to cover essential services and pay soldiers’ salaries as tax revenues have nosedived since the beginning of the war in late February. The physical damage wrought by Moscow’s campaign is estimated to have already reached $94 billion, with reconstruction projected to be upward of half a trillion dollars.   
  
The World Bank has projected that the Ukrainian economy is set to shrink by as much as 45 percent this year. In contrast, the Russian economy, which has been hit with unprecedented Western economic sanctions and a rapid withdrawal of nearly 1,000 Western companies, is set to contract by about 11 percent.  
  
“Eventually, Ukraine will need massive support and private investment for reconstruction and recovery, akin to the task of rebuilding in Europe after 1945,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a speech in Brussels on Tuesday. “What’s clear is that the bilateral and multilateral support announced so far will not be sufficient to address Ukraine’s needs, even in the short term.”  
  
With U.S. officials warning that Russia is settling in for a protracted conflict, Ukraine’s need for economic aid is only set to grow as it seeks to stave off the macroeconomic turmoil that could undermine its performance on the battlefield.  
  
“In order to win the war, you have to have a strong economy because a strong economy means more time to think about the war, better manufacturing, better supply lines, better logistics, better human capital,” said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, who previously served as Ukraine’s minister of economic development.  
  
So far, Western countries and international financial institutions have ponied up. In early March, the International Monetary Fund approved a $1.4 billion emergency loan, and the World Bank approved a financial package of $723 million in grants and loans. On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed an additional $9.5 billion in loans to help the Ukrainian government keep basic services afloat and to establish a “rebuild Ukraine” platform to help with the country’s postwar reconstruction. On Friday, finance ministers from G-7 nations pledged $20 billion to support the Ukrainian economy, and the U.S. Senate this week passed a $40 billion military and humanitarian aid package to support the war effort, $7.5 billion of which was earmarked for the Ukrainian economy.  
  
The trick will be sustaining this level of support as the war casts a long shadow over the global economy and economists begin to sound the alarm of recession risk. “Fatigue is coming on Ukraine, and Russia is counting on that,” warned Laurynas Kasciunas, chair of the Lithuanian parliament’s committee on national security and defense. Russia’s goal is to “target not only civilian infrastructure but all capabilities of the Ukrainian economy,” he added.   
  
Ukraine entered the war on a strong economic footing, buoyed by a strong harvest, high currency reserves, and a low debt-to-GDP ratio. That plus some nimble policymaking enabled the country to weather the initial shock of the war, which has, to date, forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes, with 6 million of them leaving the country. “They have done a remarkable job,” said a U.S. Treasury official speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Biden administration.  
  
In the first weeks of the war, the government slashed taxes to 2 percent in a bid to help businesses stay afloat as well as eliminated value-added taxes and customs duties on imports to expedite the flow of humanitarian and military aid into the country while capital controls were used to stabilize the currency. Throughout the war, the country’s banking system has continued to operate, as has the internet in much of the country. Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said a recent survey of the organization’s members found that 41 percent were fully operational, whereas 88 percent were continuing to pay full salaries to staff. A fifth of the chamber’s members said they had sustained some kind of war damage while 7 percent had at least one employee killed in the conflict.  
  
As the war has dragged on, the costs to the Ukrainian economy have continued to mount, setting off a cascade of economic and logistical challenges. Inflation has spiraled while gasoline is in short supply throughout the country as Ukraine’s ports and its largest oil refinery have been targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine’s ports handled as much as 70 percent of the country’s imports and exports before the war, and Moscow’s ongoing blockade in the Black Sea presents the single biggest threat to Ukraine’s economy.   
  
“The outcome of this war hinges on the ability of Ukraine to restore its economy, and the only way to do that is to break the Russian blockade,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and executive chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank.  
  
Efforts by Europeans and the United States to shift exports north via road and rail links can’t compete in volume with what Ukraine’s ports used to handle, exporting 5 million tons of grain a month from entrepôts like Odesa, Ukraine, before the war. Russia and Ukraine account for around 30 percent of the world’s wheat supplies, and the war has contributed to a “perfect storm,” compounding food insecurity for millions of people around the world. “We truly are in an unprecedented crisis,” David Beasley, head of the United Nations’ World Food Program, warned at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.   
  
Beyond the immediate support required to keep the Ukrainian government afloat, the U.S. Treasury official outlined two further types of support the country is likely to need in the future. In the medium term, Ukraine will need substantial international support to begin rebuilding critical infrastructure damaged in the war, support local governments in caring for returning refugees and displaced residents, and allow economic activity to begin to ramp up. The third phase is the long-term reconstruction of the country, which is hard to price just yet.   
  
“That is the number we can’t really quantify right now. It could be in the hundreds of billions,” the Treasury official said.",a41ededfb46c028aa5a407adcb4a56e5274fedc7,True,False,,,,,0,1653188044,,0,{},i9it194,True,t3_uv224o,False,True,t3_uv224o,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv224o/ukraines_other_front_line_russia_has_flailed_on/i9it194/,1653188056,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653159244.0,

Christ gave two commandments, love your neighbor as yourself, and to love God first and foremost.

Sin is sin and that's between them and God, not to answer to man about, unless it disrupts man's fundamental right to live and be safe. I.e. judgement for theft, murder, etc.

See, these old testament junkies don't understand that the new testament was supposed to stand in place for the law of the old testament, but it still seems that many regard it as current law, rather than accepting the commandments that Jesus gave us. Just like how Christ says that where two or three are gathered, that's where God can be found - and yet we still think megachurches are the move.

In Buryatia and other peripheral, non-Russian regions, local activists are cleverly subverting the Kremlin’s severe censorship by creating anti-war posters in their native languages, such as Buryat, Kalmyk, and Chuvash.

When academics ‘westplain’ Russia’s war against Ukraine, they reinforce a culture of detachment. We must not ignore the embodied knowledge of war, writes Darya Tsymbalyuk.

When the escalation of the war against Ukraine started, I felt constantly nauseous, no matter if I stood still or walked, ate something or skipped food. Our bodies are vessels of knowledge. Safety and security are bodily experiences; they are experienced differently when you are in Ukraine, and even when you are from Ukraine but living abroad. Representation matters because knowledge is embodied, and different bodies carry different memories and different perceptions. Underestimating embodied knowledge creates a blind spot that leads to the West’s nonurgent response of pacifism and peace negotiations, while people of Ukraine insist on being given more military aid instead. This is exactly where ‘westplaining’, a toxic tendency of Western experts to ignore local knowledge while explaining Eastern European contexts, fails in its arrogance and privilege.

This is exactly where ‘westplaining’, a toxic tendency of Western experts to ignore local knowledge while explaining Eastern European contexts, fails in its arrogance and privilege. The embodied memory is also what both the West and Russia overlooked in their calculations of the fall of Kyiv. Ukraine is a country that has a bodily memory of civic resistance that achieved its goals (heartbreakingly, at the cost of many lives) — the revolution of 2013–2014. That memory of mobilization and solidarity lives within our bodies, and that is what drove the country to immediately unite in a current volunteering effort.

Not so sure Ukraine was baited in Kharkov. it is very strategically important area and if anything perhaps Russia did underestimate the Ukrainians and this will have a serious knock on effect if supply lines can be cut to Izium.

Down in Donbass, I agree Ukrainians have been taking heavy losses and losing ground and I am going out on a limb here, but is this where the Ukrainians have baited the Russians?  Severdonetsk looks bad etc, but and I hope I am right.   It appears to me the Russians are consolidating there forcers here and we have not seen much use of the M177s etc, ok token gestures.   Personally I think the Ukrainians are creating their own battle of Kursk only this time Von Manstein is on the Ukrainian side with freedom of movement.

Take out the armor and with it a huge amount of Russia's capacity will be depleted. at a 3-1 ratio of 1 dead 3 wounded Russia is losing nearly a BTG a day. Men are going to have to be rotated and getting many back to the front will be difficult.

In relation to losses I do not agree now is the time to do percentages.  At present Ukraine has 700,000 under arms.  Fact, you cannot join the territorial defense units now, there is a waiting list.  Biggest problem now is logistics and weapons.

Even if Ukraine is losing the same amount of men this only makes their resolve stronger while it has the opposite effect on the invader.

Agreed ther are many armchair generals and thank ..... I am not leading the Ukrainian Army or they would have lost already, but the guys who are leading are doing an incredible job in my limited opinion.

The U.S. Army is weighing options for fast-tracking the delivery of M1 Abrams tanks to Poland to boost the NATO nation’s armor capabilities and replace old tanks donated to Ukraine for use in the war against Russia. Through new pathways opened by Congress, including the recently revived Lend-Lease program, Poland could take possession of U.S.-built armor years ahead of current schedules, the Army’s chief weapon buyer told lawmakers yesterday.


Having already donated about 240 Soviet-era T-72 tanks to Ukraine, Poland needs U.S. tanks sooner than 2025 to “backfill” its armor capabilities, Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said during a May 17 hearing of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Air and Land Systems. The Polish government signed a foreign military sales deal in April with the U.S. to buy the 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks for $4.75 billion, but under the current schedule those tanks won’t show up in Poland until late 2024 or early 2025, Turner added. His district includes the Army's Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, also known as the Lima Army Tank Plant, where these tanks are made.



“In terms of acceleration, there are options,” Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisitions, Logistics, and Technology Doug Bush told Turner and other members of the House Armed Services Committee in response. “It could involve, for example, prioritizing deliveries to them a little bit ahead of the U.S. Army or other allies. Those are dials we can turn. The Army is normally not the one to decide that. That would normally be [the Office of the Secretary of Defense]. But that is one option.”

Bush said the Army could deliver the tanks and other vehicles through the recently-passed Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act. That law provides explicit authority for transfers of U.S. arms to Ukraine, but also mentions helping other ""Eastern European countries impacted by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine,"" which would include neighboring Poland. The stated goal of that assistance would be “to help bolster those countries' defense capabilities and protect their civilian populations from potential invasion or ongoing aggression by the armed forces of the Government of the Russian Federation,"" the legislation states. You can read all about this new Lend-Lease program here.

Using the new Lend-Lease act is one of several ways the Army is trying to “think creatively about how we could provide them with tanks in the interim,” Bush added. “Those are very nascent conversations, though, so I would have to come back to you with more detail in the classified space or to give you the whole story.”

In the meantime, U.S. troops are preparing to train their Polish counterparts to operate and maintain the tanks before the vehicles arrive in Europe, Bush said. That should give Poland a leg up on getting the M1s into the field when they do show up. 

“Another thing we're doing to try to enhance cooperation with Poland is, in the meantime, establishing a training activity with them to allow for at least initial familiarization training with U.S. soldiers on Abrams tanks in Poland,” Bush said. “Those efforts are underway … to try to get them a head start on the people-side of operating an Abrams tank and doing logistics.”



Poland sent at least 240 of its T-72s to Ukraine, enough to equip two brigades as the country battles an ongoing open-field Russian onslaught in the east, The Wall Street Journal reported in late April. That transfer did not totally deplete its armor capabilities, however. The Polish Army operates hundreds of several variants of the more-modern Leopard 2 tanks it received from Germany beginning in 2002. It also has domestically modernized T-72 derivatives called the PT-91 Twardy in service.",a0640e41fef48330f73ac6145c048d5264ecd03c,True,False,,,,,0,1653183789,,0,{},i9ila96,True,t3_uv0vbd,False,True,t3_uv0vbd,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uv0vbd/us_army_could_use_new_lendlease_act_to_speed_m1/i9ila96/,1653183805,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653154989.0,

If they use WMDs in Ukraine, it won't matter if Putin *believes* in the reality of Western retribution.

And you are taking Putin's public pronouncements about his tragically miscalculated understanding of Russia's geopolitical relationship with the rest of the world as just bare fact? He is wrong constantly. His ""come at me bro"" attitude says little about Russia's actual ability to throw or *take* a punch.

Its become sooo cliche to compare this with WWII, but Putin banking on the West's previously soft acts diplomacy to continue under *any* condition is pure Hitlerian fantasy.

Russian leadership dramatically underestimated both Ukraine and Western unity with this invasion, and citing their own words of bluster about ""*not caring*"" doesn't do anything to suggest they can *actually* overcome the sort of consequences they are imagining in such silly statements as Putins'. Even in Russia, most competent technocrats disagree with him, but are silenced with threats of prison or murder.

We should be scared of Russian leadership's further miscalculations, but we shouldn't for one moment be afraid that they will actually *achieve* what they aim to achieve because they are largely operating according to a sort of ahistorical fantasy only made digestible through the sort of shared misery and propaganda generated from the fall of the USSR. They are simply fighting a war on false pretenses, with fantasy hopes, obsolete weapons, false patriotism, and a broken economy that can only generate rubles for oil while making almost nothing with added-value.

WMDs are just an even worse dead-end for them.

And cool it with the ad hominem.

1) Repair critical infrastructure.  
2) Pay compensation&amp;medical bills to injured soldiers and families of fallen soldiers  
3) Repair destroyed homes or pay for resettlement  
4) Repair destroyed businesses which are commercially viable on their own.

This will absorb foreign aid and investment. Post war Ukraine will be short of money because there is so damn much destruction to repair.

There were several proposals to complete a second AN-225 even before the war which fell through because it was deemed not worth the trouble. 

I think people underestimate the effort going into developing/updating an aircraft design, preparing the tools&amp;processes to build it and then certify it so you are actually allowed to use it for commercial operations. The estimations for An-225 completion costs range from several hundreds of millions to 1B+.   
This assumes Antonov, which hasn't built anything bigger than a regional jet for decades, has the necessary engineering capability ready after the war. 

The Russian Wikipedia article is interesting in this regard: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BD-225

&amp;#x200B;

 A more prudent endeavour would be to restart production of an updated AN-124:  
i) AN-124 has a more reasonable size that would make it attractive for more customers, both civilian and military, making a small series production possible  
ii) It is an aircraft optimised for internal cargo transport, while the An-225 is optimised for external cargo transport (a nowadays unused feature)  
iii) Some technology updates would get the An-124 pretty close to An-225 capabilities 

This being said, I hope I am wrong. Maybe the combination of an unfinished fuselage with the tail and wings and engines from the wreck and some foreign financial help will do the job.

My grandma holds 24 Soviet patents, most relating to the Soviet forklift. She basically redesigned the whole thing in the 70s. Why did it need the redesign, you ask? Well, it's because of it's weight distribution. It had a tendency to tip forward and push the blades into the floor. Why is that an issue? Because the only application of the forklift was to load and unload trains cars that had a plywood floor, and the pre-70s model would rip up those floors. The model that was manufactured with my grandma's enhancements had a better distributed weight and did not rip up train car floors.  

Here's the interesting part - the only place pallets and forklift were used were in the port to train loading and unloading process. In the entirety of the USSR, and apparently now in Russia. That's it. 

With the influx of Western companies, there was certainly a more developed commercial logistical system, but that never made its way to the military.

Young Russians are the most likely to self-identify as Russian nationalists, much more so than older Russians, by a hefty margin - 16% vs 10% \[2\]. Older Russians are mainly afraid of ethnonationalism because it's punishable and cling to Soviet official multiculturalism.

It's not a random selection. Those are all the most prominent nationalist movements who organised the Russian Marches, and the propagandists are the bulk of prominent Russian propagandists.

There are quite a lot of ethnonationalist left-wing parties around the world. A classic example would be Economic Freedom Fighters in South Africa. South Korean left-wingers are ethnonationalist in contrast to the conservatives. Don't see the relevance here though. Russian ethnonationalists are mainly against the war, Russian multiculturalist imperialists are pro-war.

This is true. This is 100% true. 

**BUT**

That is in an organization where you spend:

* 25% of your time at admin unfucking your pay
* every Thursday (or whatever) doing family day or whatever
* no Fridays, ever, flying or training
* so many three and four-days fucking around
* half the time wondering why all of maintenance is in leadership training
* 25% of your time at dental/medical
* 5% of your time doing mandatory cyber awareness training
* two hours at lunch every day
* 30% of your time waiting
* org day at the lake having a shitty day

and so on and so on and so on.

I am completely aware of the pace at which training occurs in the US military. I am also aware of the pace at which it COULD occur, and sometimes does when needs are urgent. 

So it is true that being processed through the bloated machinery that is military training at an FRS takes six months.
