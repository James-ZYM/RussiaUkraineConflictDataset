[],False,,TopSpin247,,,,,,"To me, the SAD symbolizes abundance, efficiency, and instant gratification. I do see many examples of low quality fast food places (McDonalds, Pizza Hut) becoming high end restaurants when exported oversees. 

The most plausible explanation for why our food is so addictive and cauters so well to so many different cultures is that the American food industry has been extremely efficient at isolating key chemicals that makes food ""good"" and re-packaging them in higher concentrations. For example, humans like sweet tasting berries and bananas, so we learned to isolate pure frustoce and sucrose to repackage them into candies, cakes, and desserts. Why eat an apple when you can have Fruit Loops with much higher concentrations of sugar? The corn industry took over America in the 50s and 60s, and nowawadays high fructose corn syrup is in about half our items in the grocery store. And we learned to do this much cheaper than actually growing the original whole foods themselves.

Unfortunately, both in the US and abroad, kids are becoming addicted to them in larger numbers and local cuisines cannot compete with SAD foods extremely high in saturated fats, sodium, and simple sugars. Just go into any McDonalds overseas (Japan, Germany, China, even France) and you'll see an abundance of kids in them.

[],False,,the_lonely_creeper,,,,,,"I'm sorry, what? Then why the hell is Europe moving heaven and earth to help Ukraine in this war? Seriously! At least try to refute my argument, rather than dismiss it!

But fine, since you don't seem to understand: War in Europe, is the single worst thing that can happen, as far as the EU is concerned. Its entire foundation is based on preventing that. That gives Ukraine political significance, as a start.

Now then, you have the second issue: The EU is composed of lots of small states (seriously, most countries in the EU have less than 10 million people). Those have very good reason to ensure ""Great Powers"" (or even overambitious dictators of Erdogan's type) don't get to play games of this sort on the continent, especially without the EU agreeing (and that means those small countries as well).

This creates a second interest for the EU in Ukraine.

A third one can be found in the matter of legitimacy: The EU, for better or worse, has ambitions. One of them, is to be one of the three top blocks on the world, alongside Russia and China. Ukraine originally had its revolution, exactly because Ukrainians want to join the EU. Exactly how would it look to the world, if the EU simply sat back and didn't help them? 

Well, about as fine as the US leaving some Canada to fend for itself, I'm pretty sure. This means the EU has even more interests in Ukraine.

Another is the ambition to unite the whole of Europe, democratically. Again: That requires at the very least a democratic and independent Ukraine, if not a democratic Russia. So yet another interest in favour of Ukraine.

And all this without considering any cultural or economic issues, or how the European Public is massively pro-Ukrainians, since Russia has broken a very big taboo with this invasion.

Now, here's the thing: Let's assume Ukraine is annexed. What does that mean? Well, it means the EU has a hostile neighbour to its East, and needs to prepare. Furthermore, it's now locked in a power struggle, in order to overthrow the Russian regime and establish a new independent Ukraine. 

Even more, Russia is suddenly the new Nazi Germany (not the USSR), especially if more massacres happen. And well, while the USSR inspired many in its day, Nazi Germany was never known for much more than terror and violence.

Basically, whichever way you spin it, Russia will be considered hostile for Europe, until those in charge of Russia, change.",0d27cd89380ee102ee969a36e8ea18d0d44a9615,True,False,,,,,0,1653257929,,0,{},i9m5spu,False,t3_uug7cj,False,True,t1_i9kx4bx,/r/geopolitics/comments/uug7cj/can_nato_survive_a_future_withdrawal_by_the/i9m5spu/,1653257943,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653229129.0,[],text,t2_5szcne1w,False,False,

The West - especially the US State Dept and Victoria Nuland - championed the pro-EU factions. They spent $5B on what they called ""strengthening democracy"", but all that money went to Western Ukraine to bolster the pro-EU side. The US didn't send a dime to Donbas to strengthen their democracy. So it would be like if China came to the US and donated $160B to Republicans. 

And when this ended with a violent coup that overthrew the *fairly elected* (according to OSCE monitors) President, the West cheered. And when people started protesting their government being overthrown in such a manner, they were denounced as terrorists. Instead of working out a compromise, nationalist volunteers formed army units to smash heads and bring this new ""democracy"" at the point of a gun. 

It didn't have to be this way. Even back in 2010, Russia had suggested that maybe the EU could compromise - that Ukraine could work toward EU membership but still retain its trade ties with Russia - trade ties that were very deep with Donbaa. EU said **NO*"" - Ukraine would have to choose one way or the other. EU *or* Russia. 

That was a despicable choice to impose on a country that was already so deeply split. A country that had been built upon compromise was ripped apart. But when ""our"" side wins, we don't give a damn about democracy. We anoint them ""moderate rebels"" even as they burn dozens of protesters alive in Odessa. 

EuroMaidan was never about democracy - it was about one faction of a country using force and terror to impose its will on their fellow citizens. There's no democracy movement in history that had literal nazis as it's vanguard, yet we act like they're the deluded ones.

Obviously the most powerful nation in a chaotic region will affect more change than a similarly (or more) powerful nation will in a stable region.
  
When North America did resemble the chaos of 1947 South Asia, the US did the same. They began as a smattering of disunited individual colonies on the east coast, overthrew the British militarily, federated together, colonized their way to the west coast, bought Louisiana from the French and Alaska from the Russians at a heavy discount, fought the Mexicans and gained what is today Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, fought and won a civil war, annexed Hawaii, and subsumed the Spaniards in Cuba and the Phillipines.

an invasion to capture land.

the udssr's invasion in afghanistan or americas invasion of iraq both had not the objective to capture land.

&gt;When did i even say about trade. 

how the west treated putins first invasion of ukraine or georgia shows that they were not acting hostile towards russia.

&gt;The gun pointed at Putin's head was Ukraine joining NATO.

ukraine joining nato (wich it wouldnt have done since france and germany vetoed that) was not a threat to russia.

&gt;Why did US blockade Cuba if everyone is free to choose their alliances?

because cuba is not part of the helsinki accords.

&gt;Why did many puppet governments were installed by both sides in Cold War? 

because these countrys were not part of the helsinki accords

&gt;Why does US threatens everyone with sanctions if they do something friendly with a country they don't like?

russia was free to impose sanctions on ukraine. who you trade with and who you dont trade with, thats up to you to choose.

&gt;Why did they impose sanctions on Turkey?

because the us does not want turkey to reveal weaknesses in the us new fighter jets to russia

&gt;Why are they threatening india with the same if everyone is free to choose?

same reason why russia would attack european soldiers helping ukraine.

&gt;I am not saying bsy of pigs was right i am saying USA did this cause they felt threatened and Russia is now doing this cause they feel threatened.  Bay of pigs happened cause Cuba had Soviet nukes and personal. This war is happening cause it's not the same but nearly similar things. Russia fears that US troops and nukes will be on Ukrainian soil and then their game will be over.

bay of pig invasion was not done because the us felt threatened by cuba, it was years before the cuba missile crisis and cuba had neither sovjet nukes nor sovjet soldier on its turf when it happened.

if anything, the invasion secured the position of castro and was the reason why castro allowed the sovjets to deploy nukes on cuban soil.

the war in ukraine is not happening because the us could station nukes in ukraine. there is little to no difference in stationing nukes in ukraine vs. stationing nukes in the baltics or poland.

the war in ukraine is happening for several reasons. 

gas fields in ukraine, putin wants to capture to secure his near monopoly on gas in europa.

capturing a young and well educated population to combat russias demographic problem

reestablishing the russian empire and thus making him self untouchable when he retires and the next dictator takes over.

capturing a land bridge to the krim.

&amp;#x200B;

the idea that the us would actually invade russia is, quite frankly, idiotic.

while the us could defeat russias conventional forces handidly, any threat big enough to destroy russia it self would be met with nukelar weapons. the us knows that, russia knows that. as such, both know that they wont invade each other.

2. Since you bring up Cuba, the Cuban Missile crisis only happened because each side brought their ballistic missiles too close to each others territory, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum, with Russia as a signatory, to give up its nuclear weapons under a guarantee that, and I quote here, ""The Russian Federation, reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine"". 

Ukraine never had any intention of hosting nuclear weaponry on its territory. Russia already shares a land border with 4 NATO states so its not about fear of encroachment either.

2. The US has no reason to invade Mexico in the event of hostilities. War is expensive and closing its southern border to Mexican goods and people cuts 80% of its foreign trade. The USA has embargoed trade from China recently who is an even larger exporter of goods to the US with little negative consequences to their economy so doing so to Mexico wouldn't hurt any more.

The Russians might help alleviate this situation if their *end game* is agreed to:  They keep Crimea, the Kherson area (to the east), the Mariupol land bridge and what they have conquered so far in Donbas.

The Russians have suffered terribly in combat and likely realize their expansionism is done, except for some minor advances in Donbas they are now attempting.  Russia will not attempt to advance to Odessa or substantially threaten the rest of Ukraine at his point.  Norway and Sweden can link to NATO -- the Russians are not going to start combat in those regions.  

The Russians know a huge amount of weaponry and political heft is now arrayed against them.

Ukraine, flush with weapons, can ramp up an offensive and possibly reclaim a lot of the land the Russians have taken.  But the Russians can start firing missiles at Kyiv again, and such conflict will stall grain production and shipments needed in other parts of the world.    Further, increased conflict would  kill a lot of civilians, both Russian and Ukrainian nationality, who live in land that Ukraine will try to re-conquer.  Ukrainians will have to do the same thing the Russians have been doing,  attacking towns and villages with snipers hunkered down.  That equals a large death toll all around.

*Prediction:* The Russians will soon let it be known they are open to a cease-fire...both sides halting where they are.  This could facilitate restoration of some agriculture.  The Russians might not push for an immediate agreement, they are comfortable with  *frozen conflicts* (e.g., North and South Korea).

[],False,,Aniket2297,,,,,,"Firstly a disclosure, i am an Indian, so take that in your consideration reading it.

So Honestly speaking, No. The indian geopolitics wasn't correct per se as India didn't predict or could have predicted what was going to happen, and even in its say geopolitical positioning it didn't came out any more advantageous than other nations, to understand lets analyse the events.

The invasion started on Feb 24, it was shocking to many as people didn't expect russia to invade and when they did almost for the whole week or so, everyone expected Ukrainians to fall quite fast, and for a large scale russian victory. 

In this scenario, taking from the reasonable persons perspective any national leader which had close ties and interests with russia would have avoided being overtly in support of russia, which India did, but it also would be openly saying for peaceful resolution of conflict and territorial integrity being sacroscant, which again they did, These statements arent novel or unique, these were common statements coming out of almost all major non-european nations, This establishes that at least the statements themselves were not any far seeing statements or observations.

Secondly, hardly anyone expected Ukrainians to fight as hard and as long as they are doing right now. Even in say an alternate scenario, where russia steamrolls over half of ukraine and takes kyiv, they would have faces sanctions yes but they could also have controlled ports and other commodities exports, which they could have sold even under threat of sanctions to other nations, which they frankly are still doing right now. It would have been kinda like crimea in 2014, but larger sanctions though overall russians could still have traded. But in the current scenario, neither russians possess or hold much assets or resources in ukraine nor ukrainains themselves have time or energy to grow or trade resources for the global markets at this point.  


Lastly, while understanding and realising that ukrainians are going to fight as long as it takes, there were not many who understood the impact of sanctions and the cycle of underlying and honestly pre-existing supply chain constraints it would play into become such a level of shock to global trade. If we assume even for a second that Indian geopolitical positioning predicted the current impact, then we must look for some benefit to India with that in current scenario, which apart from getting some cheap oil and some potash are quite limited. So not much gained here, also what is gained can be debated whether were gained by geopolitical reasoning or just is taking advantage of cheap sanctioned russian oil and commodities.  


Most importantly, though i do understand the intentions and the perspective from which the OP has made the post, i would generally always avoid giving anyone may it be a person, an institution or even a nation the benefit of ***ex post facto.*** Especially where no such evidence of their analysis or reasonings existed beforehand i.e, at the start of invasion or even some weeks after it.  As if there were any such information about the impacts of the invasion and sanctions which were such well thought out in their geopolitics, the proposals such as exporting wheat to other nations would not even have been discussed, a ban on wheat, cotton recently and other such exports would have taken place much before and India would have went on a spree to prepare for alternate supplies as soon as the results started becoming clear,   


Adding on, **""India was one of the few countries to not outright condemn or condone Russian actions.""** Yes, this did not and would not have helped India much as it wouldn't have changed russian mind or even ukrainian mind about the war, and to actually for developing world to benefit in any way either peaceful pre war status or a complete russian victory would have been useful. So, i am very skeptical, that how Indian stance if even repeated by every country in the world would have helped anyone? Would russians stop their invasion because of this, NO. would ukrainains stop fighting, No (they fought for weeks without even getting much western support). So in such a situation what benefit did India or any other developing country copying indian geopolitical reasoning could have enjoyed?",a1475568f0fb11cd75865323c2c1cd50984ee1f7,True,False,,,,,0,1653206292,,0,{},i9jhwl3,False,t3_uup1d7,False,True,t3_uup1d7,/r/geopolitics/comments/uup1d7/indian_geopolitics_was_correct_developing_world/i9jhwl3/,1653206304,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653177492.0,[],text,t2_8l1bpq5d,False,False,

I guess ideally Russia would have had some hand-holding from market economies as they made this transition, but nobody stepped forward to take on such a role - a Marshall Plan 2.0 or along such lines.  

And that I think was an opportunity lost. Yeltsin's approval rating was ~5% before his re-election, but the West was firmly committed to seeing Yeltsin continue this rudderless course. Yeltsin broke every election law in the book to win re-election, and the West just ignored this. The IMF even offered Yeltsin a $10B loan, which he used to double pensions and effectively buy votes. 

So Russia set itself on this disastrous trajectory that was either going to go back to the Communists or end up with a strong-man tsar figure like Putin. It's been a catastrophe all around.
