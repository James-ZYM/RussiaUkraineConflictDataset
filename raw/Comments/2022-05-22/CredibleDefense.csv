Not to rain on your parade, but you should know that - for obvious reason - the entirety of China's heavy port machinery industry is located on their shoreline and thus wouldn't be available to rebuild their shipyard since they would be lost to the initial strike. 

For example, Sany builds their port machinery in the very exposed port of Zuhai, ZPMC in Shanghai, etc...

And I'm sure they can find some good reasons, especially if the belief makes them seem more heroic, more valid, increases their relevancy, and increases their budgets. 

I think it's the same reason that rather competent US Army officers, veterans of WW1, thought ground forces were obsolete because of Air Power, specifically the power of Strategic Bombing. That's been around since the 1920s, it's why the USAF got to become its own branch, and is still getting the biggest budget. I mean that's insane right? How many times has Strategic Bombing been tried at this point and failed, and it's proponents still believe it like it's a religion. There are still plenty of senior field grade officers especially in the USAF that fully believe that, probably a few generals too if you get them drunk enough. But that's why the USAF funding has always been so high, they convinced enough Americans and especially in Congress how important Air Power is, the power of Strategic Bombing, that they went from a side show of the Army to the dominant branch of service.

Or how many modern US Army officers think about fighting a limited war against Russia, basically thinking they and NATO could fight them like Ukraine is fighting them now, a fully conventional ""special military operation"" invasion of NATO involving only part of the active US Army BCTs with no need for mobilization. And most of all, without it going nuclear. Because everything Big Army has been pushing since the mid 2010s, that's what it amounts to. That too is absolutely batshit insane, worse than Strategic Bombing (because they don't think that'll even be ordered conventionally), and yet even the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs (one of it's biggest propoents) thinks a likely scenario that the US Army needs to prepare for. One they label as their worst case scenario they can't afford to not focus on, worth ignoring most everything else for (sound similar to anybody else?). And guess what mission pays better than COIN and peacekeeping ops? Guess what mission means more units and more equipment and more money into the defense industry machine? Guess what emergency scenario replaces the 70-80s era Big Five? 

So let's talk Marine Corps.

The Marine brass going along with this theory gets to feel super innovative and progressive, because they're doing things so revolutionary well beyond anyone else in the world that they appear like rogue Silicon Valley CEOs, so if they pull it off they will be lauded as geniuses. No, military geniuses, even more important clarification for prideful officers.

The USMC brass get to fulfill the National Defense Strategy that mentions a threat of Chinese expansion into the Pacific that the US Navy can't currently stop. So the Marines can be the hero for that. How many times has that happened, when it was the USMC saving America and not just helping? Who cares if the theoretically way they plan to contain the Chinese doesn't work now? They have eight years to figure that out.

Focusing on China means the USMC doesn't get stuck playing Second Army anymore, which might suit those who are tired of fighting wars like Iraq and Afghanistan. While many Marines pride themselves on a history of being a Small War specialist since the Banana Wars, many others hate those wars (just like inside Big Army). The China focus allows them to tell DOD ""no, we're to busy focusing on China"" when they're called. Wait! That last accusation is just slander! [Is it? ](https://news.usni.org/2022/04/26/marines-couldnt-meet-request-to-surge-to-europe-due-to-strain-on-amphibious-fleet). Now that's not directly because of Force Design 2030 but it's budget related and that's going to keep happening as the Marines divest their older global expeditionary role Berger doesn't care about anymore

So take egotistical wanna military geniuses obsessed with job security doing a mission that gets them out of shitty conflicts, that makes them the big hero. Is that it for motivation? Nope.

The [USMC budget](https://www.statista.com/statistics/239290/budget-of-the-us-navy-and-the-us-marine-corps/) in 2017 was $23 billion. In 2018 when Force Design 2030 was published it increased to $27 billion. Nice bump, right? Then in 2019 it went to $43 billion. Wow. And it now hovers around $47 billion for the last three years.

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;On April 14, 2022, the Ukrainians sank the Russian cruiser Moskva with a pair of Neptune anti-ship missiles. And that success posed an urgent question to the world’s major militaries: Has another age of warfare just begun? After 20 years spent fighting the post-9/11 wars, the United States military’s attention is again focused on a peer-level adversary. 

This kind of speculation and discussion seems to take place over and over again when in reality nothing actually changes.

Recall that when the US apparently shrugged off it's Vietnam-era experience and waged the First Gulf War. The literature was awash with discussions about ""revolutions in military affairs"", about ""shock and awe"", a renewed appreciation for the ""manuverist theory of warfare"", among others.

Then came the Second Gulf War and the experiences of the First Gulf War was then reinforced. Again, discussions abounded about ""wars in the information age"", the ""system of systems"" concept of the war machine, the ""theory of network centric warfare"" and ""force transformation"" (especially with the setting up of the Office of Force Transformation).

Then came the aftermath of the 2nd Gulff War when the US military machine was put on the back foot by a vicious and unrelenting insurgency and a renewed interest in COIN resurfaced. Again, there was talk about how the US military (but also militaries globally) had to be flexible enough to address a wide range of operational scenarios ranging from conventional war to NBC warfare to MOOTW, among others. Journals on war, defence and security were awash with these discussions and speculations like the one thethe quote represents and the article tries to instigate.

And now, with the advent of the so-called AI and LAWS, this ""change or transformation"" in and of war is taking place.

This debate does not end and usually it is pointless. The same conceptual apparatus is invoked; the same analytical techniques are employed.

For those who may think (and it won't be invalid to think so) that I am shooting from the hip and being unfair here, I can assure you that I can back up each of my assertions with numerous references.

It's not that I mind these discussions, but when I see titles like the one this article begins with, it's mildly irritating.",e034b661ca5b3fbd6f066f5df2e5bb6a0157ca06,True,False,,,,,0,1653263516,,0,{},i9mgojj,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,False,t3_uvb8zf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9mgojj/,1653263528,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653234716.0,
[],False,,Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho,,,[],,,,text,t2_16tm24,False,False,"&gt;We don't actually know if Russia would use nukes. They just threaten it. Ukraine isn't important enough to the US or NATO to take that chance. Given Taiwan's importance to China, I think China would react differently.

The cost of a nuclear war in infinite, therefore, nothing is important enough to take the chance.

&gt;Sure they're not the same, but at the end of the day one country is still using nuclear weapons against another. Even if it's against military targets, that's an escalation which carries risks. You assume the US would be willing to take that risk over Taiwan.

Ideally, the threat would deter an attack from happening. If that fails, ideally our conventional forces beat China's. If even that fails, having a back up capable of blocking a Chinese conventional invasion is incredibly useful. By having tactical nuclear weapons as a final back up, and digging in to the first island chain early, it means that even if China eventually has double the economy of the US, they can be blocked from translating that into global millitary power. 

Again, look at what Russia has done. Even though their conventional army is incapable of standing up to their western rivals, by leveraging nuclear weapons they can make themselves and their allied states, like Belarus, almost untouchable. 

Ideally, we maintain perpetual military, economic and technological superiority, but that can't be guaranteed. So as a back up, using existing alliances  in key regions, like the first island chain, and nuclear weapons to make it virtually impossible to be displaced from those regions, is a needed back up plan.

&gt;I have three questions if you don't mind. What would blocking an invasion attempt with tactical nukes look like in practice? 

If conventional forces fail to succeed on their own, it would take the form of threats, followed by demonstrations of nukes hoping to deter further attacks. If that fails and china still attempts to invade, use against landing sites.

&gt;Why not use conventional weapons, which can achieve the same goals with less risk of escalation? I'm no expert on nuclear weapons, but have you thought about nuclear fallout being carried into China (or other countries) by wind? IIRC there was a statement by NATO a while back saying that nuclear fallout entering NATO member territory would be considered an attack on NATO itself, or something like that.

During the first half of the Cold War, you could see mushroom clouds from nuclear tests in Las Vegas (and those where strategic weapons). Fallout is a concern, but it is often exaggerated in pop culture. If nukes blanketed hundreds of square miles in lethal fallout, all of the south west would be uninhabitable. 

&gt;This is why I don't think the US would be willing to use tactical nukes for Taiwan. They'd want the war to stay limited to Taiwan. They'd want the odds of the US itself being in danger to remain as small as possible. Using nukes, even small ones, would therefor be counterintuitive. Tactical nukes have never been used in combat for this reason. The risk of escalation is higher, even if they're smaller nukes. And again, conventional weapons can achieve the same goals with less risk. The argument for tactical nukes does not make sense to me, and I understand why the US got rid of most of them.

If the conventional weapons succeeded, the tactical nukes would be unneeded.",61c60de093464fc175763d0f53939e1e0d27f787,True,False,,,,,0,1653263373,,0,{},i9mgery,False,t3_uuzzq8,False,True,t1_i9m5fn5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuzzq8/china_is_telegraphing_its_military_intent_time_to/i9mgery/,1653263388,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653234573.0,

To suggest that this is something that is being implemented into the Chinese military right now, or even something that will be picked up at all is just taking a stab in the dark, let alone all of the conclusions that the authors at EurAsian Times have somehow reached.

Those societies are centralized, intricate machines that rely on the perfect interaction of millions of moving parts to produce a high standard of living, and where any malfunction leads to hardship for all. Because of that, we do not share our ancestors' casual attitudes towards political violence and are much easier to police and rule. As a result modern states are far more centralized than pre-modern ones, and are able to oppress the population to a far greater extent before armed rebellion happens.

Yeah but that goes both ways, the moment the spark ignites it's much more difficult to put down the fire than before. Any crime or atrocity against the population is instantly being shared among millions and millions of people, amplifying any perceived injustice against them. More than a century of direct and indirect russification of the Ukrainian population and general favorability towards Russia has been wiped away in mere months of this war, even the most rabidly pro-Russia regions turned hostile against Russia, because they see the injustice, the crimes done by soldiers. If Russia was able to somehow magically conquer Ukraine in 3 days without much bloodshed they would probably accept occupation and annexation, at least the pro-Russia regions, but now those sympathies are gone and are never coming back. 

In a different time the situation would not be similar. The population would know about the war but not the extent of the crimes, at least not as quickly, and it would be met with skepticism by those inclined to believe Russia because it would be essentially a hearsay. I don't think it's any coincidence that the greatest era of deimperialization has closely coincided with the speed of which the information can be shared and methods have vastly increased too. Same goes with increased rights (on average) for people around the world.

The US would be okay in terms of being able to keep people fed, somewhat employed, but attempting to blockade China from a distance like what you are suggesting means that: Taiwan, South Korea, Japan all get cut off because the PLAN can still operate within that bubble.

China can actually sustain itself in the short term, especially if it builds up its reserves.  With help from Russia and the rest of the stans they're probably relatively sufficient.

But lets go further.

Why wouldn't China align itself with Russia and the stans, ally with Iran, and threaten the Middle East with its overwhelming land forces?

That also happens to be the most expensive ATGM. Note the ""as little as"" part. 

&gt;That's patently false, though. Infantry are always vulnerable when they're in an operation. Artillery, missiles, bullets, knives, shrapnel, fire, smoke, gas, etc. They're just incredibly useful for as vulnerable as they are and highly versatile.

Infantry is not always vulnerable, certainly not when it's concealed and you don't know it's there. 

&gt;An SPG doesn't have the advanced optics or gunnery systems a tank has for direct fire nor is it as fast or as armored. You aren't going to be launching offensive operations with an SPG as a spearhead.

The reason direct fire was necessary was because of the delay in communication between a spotter and a battery and the inherent inaccuracy of artillery. Both of these problems are now solved. That is why I question the need for direct fire. 

We can see this in other ways aswell. There are few assault guns nowadays, though they were a mainstay in WW2. That's largely due to the increased ability of artillery to respond quickly and accurately. 

In any case, tanks have always had their usefulness determined by a combination of firepower, armor and mobility. However, the development of shaped charges in combination with guided missiles made the armor part just fall flat. 

Firepower is still good, albeit less important relatively for the reasons given above, and mobility is excellent. But the lack of defense means that the usefulness of a tank is highly questionable. 

&gt;Ah yes, and you just happen to know better than all the other nations of the world? You know better than the Belgians and the Canadians who planned to scrap their tanks only to cancel those plans after operational experience in Afghanistan?

Yep. This is quite common actually. During the 30s, every large nation was still building battleships. When the Japanese actually started the war, they then kept theirs in Truk for two years because they didn't know what to do with them.

For the same reason we can't intervene in Ukraine, or invade Belarus, we can make it so China can't invade Taiwan.

We don't actually know if Russia would use nukes. They just threaten it. Ukraine isn't important enough to the US or NATO to take that chance. Given Taiwan's importance to China, I think China would react differently.

&gt;Threatening to instantly nuke cities is not a credible threat, since that would trigger MAD and be suicide. But, threatening to use tactical nukes to block an invasion attempt is an extremely credible threat, since the targets are purely military and defensive in nature, the chances of escalating to MAD are very low.

Sure they're not the same, but at the end of the day one country is still using nuclear weapons against another. Even if it's against military targets, that's an escalation which carries risks. You assume the US would be willing to take that risk over Taiwan.

I have three questions if you don't mind. What would blocking an invasion attempt with tactical nukes look like in practice? Why not use conventional weapons, which can achieve the same goals with less risk of escalation? I'm no expert on nuclear weapons, but have you thought about nuclear fallout being carried into China (or other countries) by wind? IIRC there was a statement by NATO a while back saying that nuclear fallout entering NATO member territory would be considered an attack on NATO itself, or something like that.

This is why I don't think the US would be willing to use tactical nukes for Taiwan. They'd want the war to stay limited to Taiwan. They'd want the odds of the US itself being in danger to remain as small as possible. Using nukes, even small ones, would therefor be counterintuitive. Tactical nukes have never been used in combat for this reason. The risk of escalation is higher, even if they're smaller nukes. And again, conventional weapons can achieve the same goals with less risk.

That's not true. An Abrams ""only"" costs $6.2 million and the FGM-148 Javelin alone costs about $175k. And you'll want extra missiles, at least 2 men as part of a team, transport if they need to displace, plus all the standard infantry gear, plus the cost to get them to the battle space. At any rate, my point is to suggest an ATGM team is as expensive of as an MBT but to point out that it isn't free to equip, train and deploy one and they are less useful than a tank in terms of versatility. They aren't an offensive weapon, for example.

&gt; Your argument here is that infantry is vulnerable, just like tanks. But infantry is only vulnerable if not in a concealed or covered position. 

That's patently false, though. Infantry are always vulnerable when they're in an operation. Artillery, missiles, bullets, knives, shrapnel, fire, smoke, gas, etc. They're just incredibly useful for as vulnerable as they are and highly versatile.

&gt; This is something you don't need a tank for, as in, you can get the same maneuverability and firepower without the armor. 

You're not appreciating my full statement. A tank provides a battlefield usefulness no other single unit provides. An SPG or MGS can provide accurate, direct fire support and move fast but wheeled vehicles don't do well in the same types of rough terrain a tank does. A tank can physically crush obstacles in its path. A wheeled vehicle cannot.

Light armor also isn't as survivable. Armor is still effective, especially against kinetic weapons like a sabot. Against lighter AT weapons armor is also very effective. In one engagement during the invasion of Iraq a Challenger II survived 14 hits from RPGs and 1 Milan. There is no light armor vehicle that can do that. Even with APS the ability to stop incoming fire is limited by the magazines of those systems. An enemy tank can skewer a Stryker or Marder with ease.

An SPG doesn't have the advanced optics or gunnery systems a tank has for direct fire nor is it as fast or as armored. You aren't going to be launching offensive operations with an SPG as a spearhead.

Tube artillery is indirect fire. It can be used as a direct fire platform but it's incredibly vulnerable in that roll compared to a tank and it doesn't have as much versatility. In order to get support from tube artillery you have to identify the enemy, call for support, and then received support, and call for BDA and adjustments as necessary. A tank just has to see the enemy and engage them. The whole point of a tank vs tube artillery is the ability to rapidly and accurately deliver direct fire on a target.

&gt;  Though I'd question the need for that given advancements in precision guided weapons. 

I already addressed this. A missile takes time cover distance. A round from a tank is faster. An Abrams with a good crew can send as many 5-7 rounds downrange as far as 5kms before a missile can cross the same distance. This matters when you may have only seconds to target a rapidly moving target. A tank can pop out of cover, fire 2 or 3 rounds, and disappear back behind it before an ATGM can even get a lock. The only counter as fast as that is another tank.

&gt; You can only do that if you know where the target is.

Which is why the tank is one part of a combined arms doctrine. Infantry, air support, ISR, drones, etc. They all help the tank and others find the enemy first. The tank itself has advanced optics to aid in situational awareness and targeting. In at least one instance during the Gulf War a US Army Abrams tank shot an Iraqi tank through a sand dune because it could see its exhaust through thermal optics.

&gt; Monetary cost definitely matters, otherwise Germans would only be rolling around in Maus tanks. Cost × effectiveness is the relevant metric. 

I'm not sure if you're serious. The Maus tank in addition to being expensive was resource-intensive for a nation without many resources and a big target for air power when the Germans had basically no air force left. Cost is always a factor but it's more expensive to lose a war than to buy a tank. Again, the Ukrainians would spend any amount of money to win the war. Comparatively a tank is not very expensive.

&gt; Tanks have been obsolete for decades, it's just that nobody has acted on it yet.

Ah yes, and you just happen to know better than all the other nations of the world? You know better than the Belgians and the Canadians who planned to scrap their tanks only to cancel those plans after operational experience in Afghanistan? Or you know better than Ukraine and Poland who are both eager to acquire new tanks to face Russia? These nations that have invested heavily in understanding war, strategy and their defense goals all just don't realize that tanks are and have been obsolete despite decades of useful service?

&gt; I cannot speak to this engagement, but you should not extrapolate based on one engagement.

Given the lack of modern tank vs modern ATGM engagements we unfortunately have to use this data point to extrapolate a lot of facts. It's not as though this happened a long time ago, either (the Ark Royal was sunk in WWII, the battle of Wadi Saluki happened in 2006). The Israeli tanks had the absolute worst tactical situation they could imagine: no maneuvering room, no artillery support, basically no infantry support, 20+ Kornet ATGMs aimed at them and as many as 100 missiles shot at them.

Most of your post is great but I have to quibble about this bit. It's an unfortunately common myth that needs to die. Pre-modern people were not stupid, gullible half-grown children who obeyed their lords unquestioningly and had no idea what was happening outside their village. If anything they were far more political than we are today. There was no such thing as ""not being into politics"" before the industrial revolution - you *had* to be involved in local councils or you'd get the short end of whatever stick was being drawn that day, whether it was who had to repair the fence to who got to use the common lands now that the grass had gone bad. Communities similarly negotiated hundreds of informal agreements with other communities, and with their rulers.

Far from being fought by ""small elite groups"", pre-modern wars were often total, genocidal struggles between different communities. Up to 80% of North Germany's population died in the Thirty Years' War, while genetic evidence indicates that well near every man in Central Asia was killed or expelled during the Mongol invasion (Mongolian content in Kipchak DNA increased from 40% to 70% - in other words, a near total replacement of the male population by the invader within a single generation). During Caesar's invasion of Gaul, conservative estimates place mortality and enslavement of the Gallic population at 20-25%. And these are just three of hundreds of examples. 

While war and IR analysts are divided about the causes of the American defeat in Afghanistan, anthropologists studying Afghanistan are almost unanimous in believing that what Thomas Barfield describes as the ""pre-modern mindset"" of Afghan people was key in the defeat. Afghanistan is one of the few societies today that continues to operate as most did in the Middle Ages - a ""land of arranged marriages"" where every village is a political actor, and are willing to use violence if they aren't ""cut into the deal"". If anything, modern ""informed"" societies are easy to subdue. Those societies are centralized, intricate machines that rely on the perfect interaction of millions of moving parts to produce a high standard of living, and where any malfunction leads to hardship for all. Because of that, we do not share our ancestors' casual attitudes towards political violence and are much easier to police and rule.",3584bc249fc55fe5589c93d99fd0dd89e6d89a04,True,False,,,,,0,1653256381,,0,{},i9m2lf2,False,t3_uunvqj,False,True,t1_i9h6g7w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uunvqj/dmitri_trenin_moscows_defeat_in_ukraine_would/i9m2lf2/,1653256398,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653227581.0,

No one's putting them in a vaccum. We're saying that tanks are vulnerable to drones ON THE BATTLEFIELD. 

Your counter argument is essentially ""Use a bunch of different tech from different branches/forces to keep anyone from shooting the tank"" and that is NOT REALISTIC in the slightest. 

&gt; When the tank is approaching an area they cannot see well and would likely be a good place for ATGMs to hide, the infantry goes in first to scout it out and locate the enemy so that air and artillery can clear them out and the tanks can advance. Friendly drones, ISR, thermal optics, etc also help recon these areas.

The range on a Javelin is 2km. The formula for determining the area of a circle is pi*r*r. Plug 2km in as the radius, and that's over 12 square kilometers of land in which an enemy can hide and still hit your tank. How many infantry do you plan on sending with this tank? How many infantry to search 12 square km of land? 

While you think on that, realize that the switchblade has a 30km range. Good luck finding those Switchblade operators in over 2600 square kilometers.

And you’ll excuse me if your opinion carries no weight. 




As to the KIA ratios, I’m genuinely not sure why you’re including missile strikes (most of which have NOT targeted human assets, but civilian and military infrastructure which is unmanned) and Mariupol in our conversation on Donbas. Putting aside the fact that most missile strikes in the past month have been focused on Lviv and Odesa, let’s look at the issue in depth:

We know with a high degree of certainty that Russia (according to Russian media) has launched no more than 2.1k missiles. We also know from Kirby and NATO that these missiles have a failure rate that is extremely high. Some of the precision missiles have a failure rate north of 50%. We also know that at least 25-50% of missiles have been shot down, especially in Kyiv and Lviv. We just saw over 5 cruise missiles being shot down over Lviv in the past few days. Secondly, we also know Ukrainian SOP has changed drastically since the start of the war. Barracks are abandoned, troops don’t bunch up anymore, and there’s markedly better OISNT discipline. In terms of artillery, for every artillery hit from Russia, there’s a counter hit from Ukraine. Then we have to address the areas of Ukrainian strength. ATGMs blasting tank after tank. Ammo depot after ammo depot being blown up. Precision kills on generals and other top leadership. 

&gt; Ukraine suffering additional 3k permanent losses in captured soldiers

It’s hard to have good faith discussions with someone who is still sticking to this talking point. Even Russian sources had Mariupol at roughly ~4-5k troops in the second week of the invasion. If you want me to accept Russian PoW numbers from Mariupol seriously, then I’ll also take Ukrainian claims of 6k Russians **KIA** in Mariupol seriously. 

This is before we even consider the massive Russian casualties at the Moskva, Hostomel, Berdyansk and Bilohorivka.",cb1a61169af1119605b4815c84c1ef6a53284ca7,True,False,,,,,0,1653254754,,0,{},i9lz6iu,False,t3_uv9iy3,False,True,t1_i9ljd21,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uv9iy3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_22_2022/i9lz6iu/,1653254765,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653225954.0,

An ATGM crew costs far less - as little as 1% the cost of an MBT. 

&gt;And yet almost 200 years later we are still using infantry. Technology made the tactics obsolete, so the tactics change. The weapon system - infantry - were not made obsolete.

Your argument here is that infantry is vulnerable, just like tanks. But infantry is only vulnerable if not in a concealed or covered position. 

&gt;Accurate, fast and direct fire on demand with a high degree of maneuverability. 

This is something you don't need a tank for, as in, you can get the same maneuverability and firepower without the armor. 

&gt; Tube artillery isn't as fast nor can it provide direct fire

I'm not sure what you mean by not as fast and it can definitely provide direct fire. Though I'd question the need for that given advancements in precision guided weapons. 

&gt;and lighter vehicles have lighter armor which means reduced survivability.

Does it? Reduced survivability against what? 

&gt;A good Abrams crew can fire 3-5 rounds in a minute, maybe 7 or more if they're going all out and can accept the fatigue. That's 7 or more accurate, effective hits inside of 60 seconds. 

Same as an SPG then. Except the rounds are twice as large and the SPG is never exposed. 

&gt;An ATGM cannot do the same. That Abrams can get out several rounds before the missile can reach it. A platoon of 4 tanks, each putting out 3-5 rounds a minute can potentially hit 12-20 targets in a minute, and then displace to a different battle position before an ATGM can reach them. 

You can only do that if you know where the target is. If you can accurately identify every infantryman within a 5km radius, you probably don't need tanks anymore. 

&gt;The monetary cost isn't as important as the effect it has on the battlefield. I highly doubt Ukraine would put a monetary value on defeating a Russian invasion, and going by results Russia doesn't seem to put a monetary value on it either.

Monetary cost definitely matters, otherwise Germans would only be rolling around in Maus tanks. Cost × effectiveness is the relevant metric. 

&gt;At any rate, you're missing my point. Ukraine has 10s of thousands of ATGMs at their disposal but has not inflicted 10s of thousands of casualties with them. Therefore, ATGMs aren't the silver bullet they're being portrayed as. Not saying they aren't effective, but they aren't the game changer people are implying. They've been around for decades.

Yep. Tanks have been obsolete for decades, it's just that nobody has acted on it yet. Same as the Maxim gun made massed infantry and cavalry obsolete in the 1880s, but it took until WW1 for this to be realized. 

&gt;Again, in Lebanon 20+ ATGMs shooting 50+ missiles hit 11 out of 24 Israeli tanks and penetrated only 3 despite the defenders having every advantage and the attackers having every disadvantage a tank could have.

I cannot speak to this engagement, but you should not extrapolate based on one engagement. The Ark Royal (?) was sunk by a battleship.

Sigh. You're the one that thinks ""drones"" is a deep counterargument. I'll break it down to you, Barny style.

Yes, in a vacuum tanks are vulnerable to missiles and drones. That's why you don't put the tank in a vacuum.

When the tank is approaching an area they cannot see well and would likely be a good place for ATGMs to hide, the infantry goes in first to scout it out and locate the enemy so that air and artillery can clear them out and the tanks can advance. Friendly drones, ISR, thermal optics, etc also help recon these areas.

If tanks take ATGM fire they can use their maneuverability and smoke screens to avoid the missiles, get into cover and call in air or artillery.

On a larger scale, destroying the source of the threat is the best tactic. If the threat is drones, destroying their control center is the best defense. If the threat is enemy air power, destroying their airfield is the best defense. This is done, typically, with planes and missiles.

You're using the example of Russian forces that don't cooperate well with each other and haven't adequately destroyed the enemy's C3, airfields and logistics depots to prove your theory.

Defenses against drones, including loitering munitions, already exist. They will be improved and enhanced to get the desired effect - which is not an elimination of the threat but a reduction to acceptable levels. On an individual basis, active defense systems and EW systems will provide defense for tanks - but more importantly the timeless defense systems of not being seen, acquired, hit or penetrated will be a more reliable defense system. If your primary means of stopping an attack is for the armor to stop it then you have a bad system. The primary means has always been seeing the enemy first. The secondary defense has been not getting seen first. APS and armor are the very last resort. The first defense is never ""get shot and survive it"".

Other weapon systems will provide the most effective defense against drones: air defense artillery like CIWS, interceptors like Iron Dome, aircraft, drone swarms of our own, cyber warfare, smoke screens, decoys, electronic warfare, etc. This isn't a field no one has considered before, and it doesn't change warfare. It's an additional component of it that we adapt to and integrate just like we did with ATGMs.

Combined arms is the integration of different military arms to support one another. That's why it is the answer to the question of ""Drones?"" You have different weapon systems and different branches that cooperate and coordinate to achieve a result, in this case the defense against drone swarms and ATGMs.",4cda7c30988b4d6206a174f9000171e3ee7b9168,True,False,,,,,0,1653251129,,0,{},i9lrb74,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9lnd3y,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9lrb74/,1653251146,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653222329.0,

 Drones are the supreme weapon of war in the air, and at sea. We call drones used in those domains ""missiles"". Drones dominate utterly in those arenas.

I mean this says it all. This is the piece that erodes your whole argument. I, and others here, and people who are heavily invested in discussion of weapons and tactics have talked about nothing but how the Russian military has absolutely humiliated itself with its performance in Ukraine and the reasons why.

People like you that don't care to or can't comprehend it and you base your whole argument around DRONES DRONES DRONES because in one war where one side has had the benefit of the entire world's moral and material support while the other side has made every military blunder they possible could and has had every economic countermeasure applied to it that can be the side getting the unlimited free high-tech weaponry is winning.

Tanks are important. They provide capabilities no other unit on the battlefield provides. ATGMs have existed alongside tanks for decades. We know how to fight them. This is not new. What is new is a nation using second-rate MBTs of which their most advanced have the types of technology that other nations have had standard for decades invading a country that is getting regular shipments of the most advanced weapons on Earth.

There is no other unit on the battlefield that can replace a tank.

Drones are a piece of technology that has existed for a long time. The ideas your putting forward have existed for a long time. We're seeing their first application in warfare and those lessons will be learned. The countermeasures for drones already exist. They will be modified and improved as the threat increases. Right now the threat of loitering munitions doesn't really exist. The only ones with the loitering munitions are also the only ones with the defenses.

And I'll say again, you need to stop pretending that this exists in a vacuum. That tank you're talking about being so vulnerable to drones isn't going to be alone. They're going to have air support, fire support, infantry support, recon and ISR, air defense systems, active kill systems, maneuverability, armor and crew protection features. When drone swarms become a realistic threat to modern MBTs those tanks will be defended by drone swarms of their own.

So does training and equipping an ATGM team and getting them into a place where they can be effective.

&gt; You mean infantry standing out in the open, in formation? Yeah, that's obsolete.

And yet almost 200 years later we are still using infantry. Technology made the tactics obsolete, so the tactics change. The weapon system - infantry - were not made obsolete.

&gt; Like what?

Accurate, fast and direct fire on demand with a high degree of maneuverability. Tanks are still the go-to offensive unit on the battlefield able to move quickly and deliver firepower. Tube artillery isn't as fast nor can it provide direct fire, shoulder launched direct fire like a SMAW or Carl Gustav or RPG is short ranged, 25mm autocannons aren't enough firepower or as versatile, wheeled vehicles can't negotiate the same terrain tracked vehicles can, and lighter vehicles have lighter armor which means reduced survivability.

A good Abrams crew can fire 3-5 rounds in a minute, maybe 7 or more if they're going all out and can accept the fatigue. That's 7 or more accurate, effective hits inside of 60 seconds. An ATGM cannot do the same. That Abrams can get out several rounds before the missile can reach it. A platoon of 4 tanks, each putting out 3-5 rounds a minute can potentially hit 12-20 targets in a minute, and then displace to a different battle position before an ATGM can reach them. The variety of ammunition types tanks carry means they can provide direct fire support in a variety of situations - they can hit buildings, bunkers, compounds, light armor, heavy armor and large groups of infantry, even helicopters. The only thing that can adequately defend against that type of threat is another tank.

&gt; How much do these 3k APCs cost compared to the ATGMs?

The monetary cost isn't as important as the effect it has on the battlefield. I highly doubt Ukraine would put a monetary value on defeating a Russian invasion, and going by results Russia doesn't seem to put a monetary value on it either.

At any rate, you're missing my point. Ukraine has 10s of thousands of ATGMs at their disposal but has not inflicted 10s of thousands of casualties with them. Therefore, ATGMs aren't the silver bullet they're being portrayed as. Not saying they aren't effective, but they aren't the game changer people are implying. They've been around for decades.

&gt; An ATGM crew is actually much better at defending. It can attack from a concealed position without being identified at all.

Well yes. ATGMs excel at defense. In fact, they can only really be used effectively in defense. They require too much time in acquiring a target and flight to the target. A tank is a very stable platform that can fire accurately while on the move. On the defense it can attack from a concealed position and then displace before the enemy can respond. It's situational. Granted, I'm talking about the most optimistic situation where everything is perfect for the defender and nothing is perfect for the attacker. A platoon of tanks can scrub a company of enemy AFVs and then displace to a different position before an ATGM team can hit them back. Multiple ATGM teams cannot do the same.

Again, in Lebanon 20+ ATGMs shooting 50+ missiles hit 11 out of 24 Israeli tanks and penetrated only 3 despite the defenders having every advantage and the attackers having every disadvantage a tank could have.",866e10a0f30bb89cd5e56fa05810c67ba0ed5c45,True,False,,,,,0,1653247769,,0,{},i9ljzm6,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9lerns,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9ljzm6/,1653247783,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653218969.0,

Some of them have hit infrastructure, but many were used to target barracks and other troop concentration areas.

Russia also (still) enjoys a significant advantage in the number of artillery tubes in a war where most of the losses are caused by artillery. It also seems to have more ammunition at its disposal.

Wrong. Here he is from April 27th:

“In hindsight, and I’ve argued this repeatedly, Ukraine probably won this war in the first four days. I’m sure that win or lose, short of mobilization, this is the last offensive action. The Russians have suffered too high an attrition to be able to complete their envelopments. The Russian military is a **spent force**. They are trying to scrape together units and are now glued together…fragments. The overall disposition of the Russian forces isn’t very good and they don’t have a great correlation of forces.”

And this was before the 700k Ukrainian number came out. In that entire segment, he never talked about the relative force numbers. Purely that Russia had suffered losses that were too high in the first three weeks for them to carry out their largest objectives. 

You can argue whether he’s right or wrong, and he’s certainly only one voice amongst many, but let’s not misrepresent what the guy said.

Perhaps all those dead tank husks in Ukraine are more useful than I think? 

&gt; The defenses already exist: ADS to shoot them down, EW to disable or distract them, and just plain old not getting spotted.

ADS already doesn't work. I mean, you get what, 4-5 shots? They can't fire in the same direction twice. They can't protect the top of the tank. They can't discriminate between drones with warheads and cheap decoys. 

Ewar doesn't work either. The Switchblade has an autonomous mode. You can't stop it by disabling communications when its fire and forget. 

Not getting spotted seems difficult when you're a god damn tank, being hunted down by an army cheap drones that are just amazing at spotting tanks. 

NOTE: In the interests of time, I'm going to skip replying to some of what you wrote to kind of home in on the most absurd points you made. 

&gt; u haven't addressed any of the other points I've brought up, such as other AFVs being vulnerable to the exact same systems, helicopters being vulnerable to MANPADS and drones, infantry being more vulnerable to all of the above. You may as well ask why we keep tube artillery around when drone swarms are just going to kamikaze the battery. Why do we keep ATGMs when drone swarms are just going to track the missile back to the launcher and attack? Why do we bother with fighter jets when drone swarms are going to be ripping planes out of the sky, like that scene in Star Wars when Anakin flies the Jedi starfighter in the Battle of Coruscant?

&gt; AFVs being vulnerable to the exact same systems,

This is clearly not a point that in any way defends the obsolesence of the tank. 

This is a point you make when you want to show that what is being claimed is impossible because it would be too disruptive. That's what you're doing here. 

You're painting a picture where drones can't be as capable as claimed because then they would disrupt current military orthodoxy too much. You couldn't use AFVs. You couldn't use trucks. You can't, as you say, use helicopters or even infantry. 

The fact that its disruptive, or effective against other systems (and I agree that it is) does not change the fundamental argument that its rendering tanks obsolete. 

You don't get to tell the battlefield that it can't change all the things. You are correct in that drones are going to revolutionize warfare, and a lot of stuff is going to become really vulnerable. The utility of a lot of stuff is going to come into question, but that does not create a valid argument that none of this is happening. 

Now in addition to the argument that ""its impossible because its too disruptive"", it looks like you're also creating absurd strawmen. 

You start with artillery, and move on to drones killing fighters. 

But your strawman leads me to an important point, that might help you understand what's actually happening right now. 

Air warfare is ALREADY DOMINATED BY DRONES and has been for decades. We just call the drones that dominate the air ""missiles"". The drone revolution has already happened in the air. Its done, the drones won. Air warfare is entirely about drones. Drones that shoot down planes, drones that shoot down other drones. Drones that are hypersonic and attempt to outrun the drones hunting them. Drones that fly low to the ground or water and then accelerate at the last moment to surprise an attacker. Drones that engage in ewar. Drones that refuel other drones (often manned, we call those planes). 

Drones dominate the air. 

Where drones haven't won, because they have been too expensive to be practical, is in small scale land based engagements. They haven't yet won against infantry and tanks, but that's what's happening now. We're seeing the drone tech that currently dominates the skies get minimized, and applied to smaller scale land engagements where previously drones were too expensive to use.",cd8be0ff7fede6f326903c132c5cbebcc3855e88,True,False,,,,,0,1653246356,,0,{},i9lgw8b,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9ldjkz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9lgw8b/,1653246374,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653217556.0,

The problems with the Russian military run so deep it's impossible to say there is one thing they are lacking. Their whole approach to combined arms is so garbage in the first place.

For one, their weapon systems are almost comically mismatched. They hyped up future systems and concepts so much but their troops lack basics like NODs, optics and proper IFAKs. They have to use unsecure commercial radios because their military communications rely on 5G networks that don't exist in Ukraine right now. This isn't even addressing their logistics issues.

Put plainly, the wide open plains of Ukraine would be perfect tank country. But the Russians have managed to fuck even that up. They've sent waves of armored vehicles to urban areas without proper recon, without sending infantry ahead to screen it, and without proper support elements. And lo and behold they get clobbered by entrenched defenders with ATGMs.

The Russians have almost no combined arms doctrine, in effect. They can't call on fires immediately or accurately, and they aren't good enough at aerial operations to use CAS effectively. So yeah they're losing tanks in droves. Those same tanks also lack optics that are standard on western MBTs so their situational awareness is even lower. And the famous ammunition storage design makes the turret a deathtrap. You have the most modern ATGMs in the world flooding Ukraine for free going up against Russian tanks that are just OK at best.

&gt; Not that easy if the enemy also has an air force, artillery, etc.

Well yes, that's all a part of the combined arms doctrine. It's like a grandiose rock-paper-scissors. That said, it's not as though Ukraine has been super competent with their combined arms. They've had the distinct benefit of getting tons of free aid consisting of the most modern weapon systems in the west and the US has been providing free intel and being on the defensive has been good for morale and logistics and obviated the need to conduct any large scale maneuver operations.

Their air force hasn't honestly done much. It's been limited to small operations like interceptions and some limited CAS because the Russian ADS and air force does outmatch it. Their only saving grace has been that the Russians are so incompetent they can't handle large air operations and don't have enough PGMs to deal the Ukrainian air force a killing blow.

Drones and Switchblades aren't some kind of wunderwaffen. Drones, suicide drones and automated drones have been around, conceptually, for decades. Hell, the 1995 movie Screamers was all about loitering munitions in a future war. Their existence doesn't change the usefulness of a tank, nor the defenses necessary to shut them down. The defenses already exist: ADS to shoot them down, EW to disable or distract them, and just plain old not getting spotted.

&gt; Next gen Javelins and NLAWs are likely to use drone spotters.

As are the next generation of MBTs and infantry. Again, not a new concept and doesn't require novel solutions. Improvements to existing technology can provide defense. And technology is not a solution to certain constant. Not getting seen in the first place, not getting acquired in the first place, not getting hit in the first place, and not getting penetrated in the first place are all adequate defenses.

The drone can be jammed, shot down or eliminated. The missile can be destroyed in flight, shape charges deflected, sensors distracted. The ATGM can be hit by small arms, artillery or air support.

&gt; Combined Arms is a jargon based magic wand that people are using in place of a good argument. It needs to die.

Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't a good argument. This whole time you've been pretending as though the tanks exist in a vacuum, as does the ATGM. They don't. They never will. Loitering munitions need to be deployed, they need to be unimpeded, they need to be getting accurate sensor data, and they need to be supplied to the conflict zone. It's cool that loitering munitions exist in something other than the next Call of Duty game but it isn't exactly revolutionary technology. It's a missile that hangs out.

&gt; Using various military systems together does not negate the utility of drone systems.

And your conception of drone systems doesn't negate the importance of combined arms warfare in the survivability of tanks or any other weapon system. You're constantly pretending like it's going to be drone vs tank. It isn't. It's going to be force vs force. Drones are not a panacea to combined arms. They are another system that will integrate. You haven't addressed any of the other points I've brought up, such as other AFVs being vulnerable to the exact same systems, helicopters being vulnerable to MANPADS and drones, infantry being more vulnerable to all of the above. You may as well ask why we keep tube artillery around when drone swarms are just going to kamikaze the battery. Why do we keep ATGMs when drone swarms are just going to track the missile back to the launcher and attack? Why do we bother with fighter jets when drone swarms are going to be ripping planes out of the sky, like that scene in Star Wars when Anakin flies the Jedi starfighter in the Battle of Coruscant?

And that was early, 1970s stealth technology. The F-22's stealth suite is considerably more advanced.

However, the Chinese claim seems to concern the F-22's heat signature, not its low-observable qualities.

&gt; According to the South China Morning Post, a Chinese military specialist previously stated that “a ground-to-air hypersonic missile could catch up and destroy an F-22 (Raptor) in seconds if it fired a missile or dropped a bomb from short range”.

Again, it bears repeating that China doesn't have a spare F-22 to test this claim. And while I'm not an expert on the F-22, the F-22 does have thermal signature reduction capabilities. From Wiki:

&gt; The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzles reduce infrared emissions of the exhaust plume to mitigate the threat of infrared homing (""heat seeking"") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.

And

&gt; Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special topcoat and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.

""Making bad conclusions from bad data"" is basically the summary of most commentary about this war so far.

&gt;The Moskva reportedly may not have had it's ciws active (wtf? You're at war), 

There is no indication such a thing was true. But *Moskva* was in such poor material condition (a readiness report from early this year showed that all three air defense systems had massive problems and could not be described to be in fighting condition).

&gt; and if it didn't have it's ciws turned on when it was supposedly eyeballing a bayraktar,

This story is bupkus speculation based on *claims* of such a drone being involved, but no proof. The story also speculated that the reason was the TOP DOME fire control radar was slewed towards the drone—but photos of the ship immediately before she sank indicates neither it or any of the other FCRs were slewed away from stowed position.

&gt; I have serious doubts about the crew's competence when it comes to damage control.

Damage control has never been viewed as one of their strong suits—not that the Russian surface fleet has many of those in the first place.

&gt; My question has been, would the usn or another NATO navy have lost the ship under similar circumstances?

The *Mason* engagements in 2016 indicate that a DDG would be much more capable of defending itself in such a situation—at the very least it would have attempted to engage the threats.

&gt; Certainly eating a missile and ending up with a major topside fire would result in mission kill, but sinking? The stark, McCain, and Sam Roberts experiences all suggest that the USN's focus on damage control mean they may have survived.

Conceivably. You can't make surefire assumptions based on this, there are too many variables, but USN surface warships tend to be built much more robust than many foreign navies and with considerably greater focus on damage control built into the design, which is just as important as the any training.",3c28b882a639fd33485c500073c32aac2d1b43ab,True,False,,,,,0,1653244059,,0,{},i9lbtdg,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9kl7uk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9lbtdg/,1653244076,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653215259.0,

I've had a lot of these discussions, and I've seen these terms thrown around in place of anything approaching a sane argument more than once... by people that should know better. 

You can't have a sane, serious discussion on this topic without addressing the hand-wavy bullshit that is presented in place of an argument and buttressed by being valid military jargon. 

&gt; Combined arms would include using infantry as a screen to identify possible ATGM teams and engage them, using close air support/ISR to include UAS, UCAV, UAV, etc to identify said ATGM teams and provide targeting/location data to indirect fire platforms (tube artillery/MLRS), infantry or the armor unit itself.

This is a more sophisticated sounding version of ""we fight so good the enemy can't shoot a Javelin at our tanks"". 

You clearly can't do this. If you *could* do this, you wouldn't need the tank. 

If we were really capable of wiping out any enemy units capable of firing a ATGM at our tanks, then the tank itself would be completely unnecessary. This is an unrealistic fantasy.

You could also use this argument to claim any platform is not obsolete. 

You could say ""We can still use mounted calvary, which is needed to break through enemy swordsman, by using infantry as a screen to identify possible anti-calvary teams and engage them, using close air support/ISR to include UAS, UCAV, UAV, etc to identify said anti-calvary units and provide targeting/location data to indirect fire platforms (tube artillery/MLRS), infantry or the armor unit itself.""

There, now we can start equipping units with horses and sabres, secure in their continued relevance. When you use the ""combined arms"" magic wand to grant any unit invulnerability, anything's possible. 

This IS NOT a serious argument. You can't start from a position of ""Our units are invincible due to combined arms"" and argue from there. 

&gt;The US is heavily investing/has heavily invested in counter-drone tech as part of its growing EW capabilities, especially for infantry units.

That's COIN tech. It works against commercial drones. Its great if you want to stop someone from strapping a grenade to a commercial drone and flying it into a group of your soldiers, its completely useless against drones designed for war by a near peer adversary. 

&gt; As for autonomous units that don’t require communication that’s where systems like the Trophy APS come into play. A loitering munition like a Switchblade is no different from a top-attack ATGM at that point (the Switchblade 600 uses the same warhead as a Javelin), and can be targeted and interdicted by more advanced APS systems like Trophy once in range.

How many shots does a Trophy have. What angles does it protect from? Can it protect from a drone flying in directly overhead? If two switchblades try to hit it from the same vector a few second apart can it get them both? What about decoys? Can you build a very cheap drone system without a warhead, have it fly towards a Trophy protected tank, and have Trophy determine that its not a threat? 

APS tech is a band aid. APS will get more sophisticated I'm sure, but its highly likely to lag behind drone tech. 

Drones are a platform, and you can iterate on them rapidly. We're seeing that happen in real time with that Pheonix Ghost. By the time you put an APS system onto a tank its likely that the enemy will already have a drone that can defeat it. 

Barring some kind of laser based miracle tech, APS systems aren't going to solve this problem.",f73c118054eb9e22487a6d97259ef6f6b1b39fa9,True,False,,,,,0,1653242053,,0,{},i9l799y,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9l1jvy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9l799y/,1653242064,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653213253.0,

[],False,,proquo,,,[],,,,text,t2_dma3j,False,False,"&gt; A tank company cannot keep a several mile radius clear...

That's called Combined Arms. If a tank just rushed through miles without having any type of support to recon and clear the area of potential threats it would be sacrificing [all but the best](https://taskandpurpose.com/mandatory-fun/integrated-survivability-onion/) pieces of protection. Tanks aren't unique in their vulnerabilities. Trucks, IFVs, APCs and Helicopters are all vulnerable to modern man-portable missiles. Are they equally obsolete? Or do they have very distinct capabilities that make them valuable?

The solution to the threat of ATGM teams is better recon and infantry to clear out ambush positions, and supporting fires to destroy ATGM teams that are less mobile than the tanks they're trying to destroy. At Wadi Saluki the Israeli infantry failed to clear the heights and the artillery refused to fire without knowing the positions of their infantry for fear of friendly fire. Good recon, such as with your own drones and aircraft and with advance infantry teams, and good support fires from artillery, mortars and air support significantly dampen the enemy's ability to utilize their ATGMs.

&gt; The capabilities of the tank are irrelevant if they can't survive, and that is the fundamental question here

But they're extremely survivable. The situation in Ukraine is greatly skewing the reality in favor of ATGMs. The Russians have utterly failed to execute any proper combined arms operations and lack several critical pieces of equipment for modern nations. Most of their own tanks lack advanced thermal optics and their infantry lack night fighting equipment, just as an example. Most wars don't also involve one side being flooded with the most modern ATGMs in the world for free.

Tanks can use their mobility and optics as defense mechanisms. Smoke launchers are a highly effective defense mechanism - how many videos are there of a tank deploying smoke and being destroyed by an ATGM? APS systems are highly effective - as far as we know no single Israeli tank equipped with Trophy have been hit by a missile. No Russian tank has APS whereas APS are a key upgrade of the next generation of Abrams SEP.

Even tanks that are hit aren't necessarily penetrated - one Challenger II survived 14 RPG hits and 1 Milan hit in a single engagement. At Wadi Saluki despite 50-100 Kornet missiles being fired at Israeli tanks and 11 hit, only 3 were penetrated.

And tanks that get penetrated aren't necessarily destroyed - 1 Merkava penetrated in the rear at Wadi Saluki had an ammo detonation, but was returned to the battle with a reserve crew.

And understand that I use the example of Wadi Saluki because it's one of the only examples of a modern armored force going up against a large number of modern ATGMs, some 20 Kornet launchers and as many as 100 missiles launched. The situation was about as dire as it could get for a tanker: the geography greatly limited maneuverability and forced the tanks to be packed in close, the enemy had full advanced warning that the IDF were coming, the IDF infantry failed to clear the heights, artillery fires were denied, and no Israeli tank popped smoke. And yet only 11 tanks were hit, only 3 penetrated, and only 8 crewmen killed. Tanks are very survivable.

The Russian tanks we're seeing destroyed in Ukraine are being hit by the most modern systems while themselves not having the most modern optics or defenses, and also being subject to really bad tactics. I won't even discuss the tanks being destroyed in the Middle East because we should all be aware that those tanks are not modern and are not being employed anything resembling properly.

ATGMS represent a major battlefield threat but tanks cannot be replaced in capabilities and as long as that is the case tanks will have a battlefield role.

&gt; You think anti-drone systems are going to keep up with that? 

It's going to be a constant arms race but vulnerabilities don't outmatch capabilities. Infantry are the most vulnerable weapon system on the battlefield - literally everything kills them. But nothing else can do what infantry can do so we keep using them. Helicopters are incredibly vulnerable. As far back as 2003 we saw the Iraqis repel a helicopter assault by the most modern attack helicopters of the day, and we see numerous helicopters being shot down in Ukraine. Is anyone going to seriously suggest helicopters are obsolete?

APS/ADS systems and EW/Cyberwarfare are going to be the answers to drone swarms. Even in Ukraine we haven't seen the Russians making much use of their well-advertised drone technology due to improvements in Ukrainian cyber war capabilities. Ukrainian success in drone warfare is owed to A) getting a ton of help from other nations that have more advanced capabilities they do not have and B) Russian incompetence allowing advanced ADS to get slapped by drones.

Are tanks going to be around forever? Maybe, maybe not. When something that comes along that can do their job as well or better with less vulnerability I'm sure we will see tanks retire.

&gt; That's why the tank is dead. Its easy to kill them

But it's really not and they aren't. Tank crews are far more able to survive tanks being penetrated than we are acknowledging and tanks are harder to penetrate than we realize. But let's assume that hit = kill. You still have to find the tank before it finds you, and you have to acquire the tank before it moves out of there, and the ATGM has to hit the tank before it gets into cover. Certain weapon systems like Javelin have a very high success rate but are very unique. They aren't proliferated enough to be a game changer for all tank warfare and they still have the same vulnerabilities as every other ATGM (but their significant capabilities make them worthwhile, see?). A tank that pops smoke, reverses out of their position or gets behind cover has a much higher likelihood of survival than you think. And this is presuming that those tanks don't have good recon from friendly drones, aircraft or infantry that are actively searching for threats.

And even with all of that, the most important aspect is what tanks can do on the battlefield. Why do you think Poland is actively supporting Ukraine and watching the effects of their weapons on Russian tanks and are still investing in more advanced tanks? Tanks deliver fast and accurate direct fires with a high degree of maneuverability and better survivability than any other vehicle on the battlefield. An M1A2 Abrams can deliver multiple rounds accurately in a minute. It can fire several rounds accurately, then rapidly displace before an ATGM team can respond. Only another tank can respond to that.",f39b5d70d05f9adeac511611ef14e941cf3025d8,True,False,,,,,0,1653240258,,0,{},i9l348f,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9kt5mw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9l348f/,1653240277,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653211458.0,

2) Combined arms would include using infantry as a screen to identify possible ATGM teams and engage them, using close air support/ISR to include UAS, UCAV, UAV, etc to identify said ATGM teams and provide targeting/location data to indirect fire platforms (tube artillery/MLRS), infantry or the armor unit itself. 

In doing so, you greatly reduce the vulnerability of any of your assets in combat. The tank suddenly isn’t driving blindly down a city or rural road, as we’ve often seen in Ukraine, nor is the infantry unsupported as it would in turn be accompanied by the armor you seem to so willingly brush off as archaic. 

As for electronic warfare, look no further than the RQ-11 Raven, which can be used as a jamming device to disrupt comms between a drone and its operator. They’ve already been used in combat by USASOC. 

The US is heavily investing/has heavily invested in counter-drone tech as part of its growing EW capabilities, especially for infantry units.

As for autonomous units that don’t require communication that’s where systems like the Trophy APS come into play. A loitering munition like a Switchblade is no different from a top-attack ATGM at that point (the Switchblade 600 uses the same warhead as a Javelin), and can be targeted and interdicted by more advanced APA systems like Trophy once in range.

 (i.e. an American platoon) can destroy an enemy tank company in seconds  
 and displace before they can be targeted and fired on in turn. This is   
not a capability that is made obsolete by the existence of ATGMs that   
cannot kill as fast or defend from such an attack as quickly. An ATGM   
still has to find, lock onto and travel to a tank to destroy it.

I don't think this is realistic - at all.   


A tank company cannot keep a several mile radius clear of guys that might be carrying an ATGM, or clear of drones that might be hunting tanks in the area. Also, how did it get to its objective? Did it already move through many, many miles of terrain where it could have been ambushed and had several tanks destoryed? I assume we're not saying that they just teleported to their destination, so they had to go through some terrain where they might have been targeted and destroyed by ATGMs.   


The capabilities of the tank are irrelevant if they can't survive, and that is the fundamental question here. It doesn't matter that direct fire is preferable to rockets if the tanks get obliterated.   


You know, the switchblades, they're like gen 1 drone systems. There's gonna be gen 2 drone systems, and many improvements from gen 2 systems as well. In addition, the improvements to drone tech... they're gonna come fast, much faster than improvements to tanks. You can cheaply iterate on drones in a way that you can't with tanks. You're gonna see software improvements. You're gonna see drone swarms where 95% of the swarm is inactive at any given time... waiting to strike targets together in a storm. You're gonna see drones that shoot, drones that scan, drones that map the interiors of structures and find enemy combatants.   


You think anti-drone systems are going to keep up with that?   


If you're able to build a system that can just automatically shoot any number of hostile targets down in an area of a few KMs in just seconds, then such a system should also effectively render infantry obsolete. If you can just instantly put down any number of hostiles in an area in an instant... why wouldn't such a system work against infantry?   


Drone tech has a simple, clear path to iterate and improve in a way that isn't that technologically challenging. Drone counters need to essentially be the perfect weapon of war... able to instantly asses an area, identify all hostiles and kill them while not killing any friendlies.

Hampton roads was the first fight between ironclads yes but the major Navies of the world already understood their importance. HMS Warrior was the pivotal event. All Hampton roads did was confirm what everyone already knew. 


Pearl Harbor did not signal the end of the battleship. In fact it proved nothing that the strike on Taranto a year early hadn't already shown. The Japanese were just paying attention. The battle that actually showed the battleship was obsolete was Midway. And not because a bunch of them were sunk, actually a lot of aircraft carriers were. But because the combat took place at such a long range that the battleships didn't get to participate and sat on the sidelines serving as AA platforms. 


In the same vein, the sinking of Moskva is not a revelation. Beyond perhaps further confirmation that Russia's awful maintenance and crew quality extends to not just the army and airforce but their navy as well. Neptune is a competent enough missile, basically an update to a Soviet design and comparable the America's venerable Harpoon. But that's not the state of the art. LRASM is. And the problems and challenges associated with sea skimming AshMs are well known and long standing. 

Ask the British about the threat of sea skimming missiles. Moskva and her defenses were, at the time of sinking, still contemporary to what the British had in the Falklands. 

In 2016 Houthis rebels fired multiple Chinese C-802 missiles at USS Mason and Arleigh Burke class destroyer. C-802 is actually loosely based on the Harpoon so comparable to it and Neptune. Mason was able to shoot down or decoy all of them. A modern warship, in good repair with an alert and competent crew is not at great risk from these class of weapons.

Imagine if the United States did not embargo Japan in 1940 after Japan took over Vichy French's Indochina. Would Japan had attacked Pearl? Let's say United States told Japan to withdraw from Indochina, even China proper, but not Manchuria, Japan's leadership will still be on the precipice of either/or, and not attack is still a serious consideration.

The weird thing about Japanese militarism in the lead up the World War 2 is that all Japanese victories(there was a string of them) were accidental in that the leadership in Tokyo was powerless and in the dark with lower level officers and field generals starting the shit. Starting from the purposeful and not accidental Russo-Japanese War, the next strings of Japanese incursions in mainland Asia(mostly China) were largely done by officers on the ground with Tokyo being kept in the dark, sometimes reacted furiously after the fact, but acquiesces when Japan wins and such moves proved popular with the populace.  

The string of attacks on American, British/Commonwealth, and Dutch targets in a Pacific War broke that string(French Indochina was more of an invitation) and was a naval engagement, so you don't have hotheaded army officers starting stuff since a fleet poises to start stuff is pretty hard to hide from Tokyo. So while it is true that the IJN was preparing extensively, the train in and of itself was not the threshold for Japan's attack on Pearl Habor. And Japan's training drew on the British attack in Taranto where Britain and Italy were already well at war, but the Italians favored keeping their navy in port to avoid a decisive battle and the British had plans ready from 1938 due to the Munich crisis. Attacking ships in port is just part of the training since you do find ships in port, even when conflict is expected(aka Taranto), so I don't buy the telegraph signal, but I do think China is cover its bases.

Okay, so we have this issue here, where people have begun treating certain military jargon also as thought stopping cliches.   


A thought stopping cliche is a term that is meant to end further thought into a subject. Examples would be ""Its common sense"".   


So you (and others, its not just you) are using certain terms almost as thought stopping cliches. Its become something that's ingrained in defense culture I think.   


The first such term you use, is ""combined arms"".   


What do you mean, what do you really mean when you say ""You use proper combined arms to avoid the burned out husk""?   


I think what you really mean is ""we fight so good that the enemy can't shoot a Javelin at our tanks"", but if you had said that, you'd have sounded like a fool, so you didn't say that. Instead you used the term ""combined arms"". You use that because its sophisticated military jargon. It shows that you know such jargon, and it injects experience and knowledge into your argument.   


It sounds really convincing. Its a really high tier military concept.   


But the way you're using it, what you really mean is ""we fight so good that the enemy can't shoot a javelin at our tanks"".   


And that... as I pointed out already... is absurd.   


Another such term is ""Electronic Warfare"".   


And that one's even more ridiculous. The Switchblade is fully autonomous (or at least can be operated in a fully autonomous mode). It doesn't even need to communicate, so how the fuck is ewar going to matter?   


Also drone communication doesn't have to be done via RC controllers. They can use modern military communication systems in drones. The term ""Electronic Warfare"" has become some vague D&amp;D counter to drone tech in too many people's minds. There is no silver bullet. Electronic Warfare will not stop the drones and rockets and whatnot from killing tanks. It just won't.   


So your argument here, where it sounds really technical and sophisticated, it sounds \*experienced\*... its essentially saying that ""we fight so good that the enemy can't shoot a javaelin at our tanks"" and ""we have a magic bullet called Electronic Warfare"".   


And that isn't a good argument. It just isn't.   


Note: You and perhaps others will probably think I'm being a dick here, and I'm really not trying to be, I'm just trying to cut through the jargony bullshit that I believe tends to hamper these discussions.

APS and armor are last resort defenses for tanks. If vulnerabilities made systems obsolete then infantry would have been eliminated a long time ago for being vulnerable to every weapon system in existence.

Tanks are vulnerable to ATGMs and drones, sure, but they also provide capabilities you don't get out of other systems. APCs/IFVs are also very vulnerable to those same systems and more but no one in their right mind talks about retiring them because they still provide extremely useful capabilities.

We're also allowing ourselves to be incredibly biased by Ukrainian success. Ignoring the Russian inability to execute competent combined arms warfare just look at the numbers: Ukraine has received 30k ATGMs in addition to the domestically produced systems, Russia has not lost 30k armored vehicles. In fact they've only lost about a tenth of that and not all to ATGMs. Therefore it's easy to determine that there is at least some missiles that never hit or destroyed their targets. This would track with the only other real data we have on mass ATGM attacks on armor: Israeli forces being fired on by dozens of Kornets at Wadi Saluki for a loss of 11 tanks.

The capabilities that a tank brings to the battlefield aren't yet matched by other systems which is why they've long endured. A tank can fire faster than a missile team. A cannon round will reach its target before a missile does. A tank can fire and maneuver better than a missile team. A tank is a stable system that can fire while attacking.

A platoon of tanks with good coordination, good optics and good training (i.e. an American platoon) can destroy an enemy tank company in seconds and displace before they can be targeted and fired on in turn. This is not a capability that is made obsolete by the existence of ATGMs that cannot kill as fast or defend from such an attack as quickly.

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,[],,,,text,t2_dg31a,False,False,"&gt; ANYWHERE YOU turn in Moscow, it's easy to find members of the Russian elite who wonder why the West thinks that war in Ukraine is the Kremlin’s preferred course of action. Even if the Russian army managed to force Kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties, the damage to Russia’s national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex Crimea and to stir conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region. The fact that Russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war.
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to Ukraine, people in Moscow and the West can be forgiven for assuming that the Kremlin’s policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons. What actually drives the Kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to President Vladimir Putin, as well as those of the Russian leader himself. Emboldened by perceptions of the West’s terminal decline, no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with America and Europe. In fact, the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider Mr Putin’s war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country’s foreign policy.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent years members of this group have become very vocal. Messrs Patrushev and Naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and Russia’s international role. According to them, the American-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of Western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance, multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities. A new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values. A feisty, resurgent Russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order, along with a rising China. Given the state of affairs in Western countries, the pair contend, it's only natural that they seek to contain Russia and to install pro-Western regimes in former Soviet republics. The West’s ultimate goal of a colour revolution in Russia itself would lead to the country’s conclusive collapse.
&gt; 
&gt; Washington sees unfinished business in Russia’s persistence and success, according to Mr Putin’s entourage. As America’s power wanes, its methods are becoming more aggressive. This is why the West cannot be trusted. The best way to ensure the safety of Russia’s existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep America off balance.
&gt; 
&gt; Seen this way, Ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle. The stakes could not be higher. Should Moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence, Russia’s endurance as a great power will itself be under threat. On a personal level, the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of Soviet nostalgia, great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the Russian Orthodox faith. The fact that the new elite in Kyiv glorifies the Ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at Moscow is a huge personal affront.
&gt; 
&gt; Why then are the people around Putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions? In their eyes, the sanctions that the West imposed to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas were intended largely to check Russia’s rise. America and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another, they were just looking for an excuse. Since 2014 such views have solidified. Messrs Patrushev, Bortnikov and Naryshkin all find themselves on the US Treasury’s blacklist already, along with many other members of Mr Putin’s inner circle. There is no way back for them to the West’s creature comforts. They are destined to end their lives in Fortress Russia, with their assets and their relatives alongside them.
&gt; 
&gt; As for sanctions by sector, including those that President Joe Biden’s team plans to impose should Russia invade Ukraine, these may end up largely strengthening the hard men’s grip on the national economy. Import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies, including through Rostec. The massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of Mr Putin’s from his KGB days in East Germany, Sergey Chemezov. In a similar vein, a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned Russia has led to spectacular growth in Russian agribusiness. The sector is overseen by Mr Patrushev’s elder son Dmitry, who is Mr Putin’s agriculture minister.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which, unsurprisingly enough, are also filled with KGB veterans. If anything, further sanctions wouldn’t just fail to hurt Mr Putin’s war cabinet, they would secure its members' place as the top beneficiaries of Russia’s deepening economic autarky. The same logic is true of domestic politics: as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege, the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime. That further cements the hard men’s grip on the country.
&gt; 
&gt; After two years of covid-induced self-isolation for Kremlin bosses, there is a clear tendency toward tunnel vision and a dearth of checks and balances. Russia’s interests are increasingly becoming conflated with the personal interests of the people at the very top of the system.

No doubt this conflict is showing the potential of defensive firepower competently and enthusiastically applied... But is it really proof that offensive platforms are obsolete, when said offensive platforms have been so incompetently employed?

The Moskva reportedly may not have had it's ciws active (wtf? You're at war), and if it didn't have it's ciws turned on when it was supposedly eyeballing a bayraktar, I have serious doubts about the crew's competence when it comes to damage control. My question has been, would the usn or another NATO navy have lost the ship under similar circumstances? Certainly eating a missile and ending up with a major topside fire would result in mission kill, but sinking? The stark, McCain, and Sam Roberts experiences all suggest that the USN's focus on damage control mean they may have survived.

Extend similar questions about the employment of armor in offensive operations. Would a NATO military have sent poorly supported armored columns in deep penetration decapitation attacks aimed at Kyiv?

From a 🇬🇧 POV, the last serious naval war was the Falklands conflict, and a lot of lessons were learned in spring 1982. Some ships survived Exocet missile strikes, some were lost like *Moskva*. The difference was less to do with the initial blast damage, and more to do with crew damage control and recoverability. Lessons learned since form a huge amount of RN survivability doctrine. 

I'm not convinced the Russian Navy has applied any of those lessons. The missiles are actually quite small, they hit the superstructure without damaging watertight integrity, so they don't directly sink the ship - they do start fires and create injuries and chaos.

It only happens once in a while and you have to read a number of duds before you hit gold, this article was a bit of gold for me. The article itself is surprisingly short as most of space in the PDF are citations and intro-outro pages, without that it would likely be no longer than an a news paper article. So I recommend reading the article and not just the summary.

Before I read this article I would have thought that estimating the logistics of invasion and the military balance across the strait was a straight forward task of looking at naval ships, and especially amphibious landing ships. But the author here makes a convincing case that this is not how the Chinese leadership have organized their forces, or how they have planned to act against Taiwan. That this is so official and well organized is really telling as this was not an improvisation or temporary measure until more LPDs were built. The use of massive amounts of civilian vessels and their civilian crews is very much a serious and long term undertaking. 

To me this is another clue that the official Chinese military budget is grossly undeclared, as these civilian ships and their crews would likely be a massive amount of money to plan, build, train, and sustain. Yet they are not listed as official military assets. 

----------------------

Summary:

Most analysts looking at the Chinese military threat to Taiwan conclude that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is incapable of invading the island because it lacks the landing ships to transport adequate quantities of troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. This report challenges that conventional wisdom, arguing that the PLA intends to meet these requirements by requisitioning civilian vessels operated by members of China’s maritime militia (海上民兵). Since the early 2000s, the Chinese government and military have taken steps to strengthen the national defense mobilization system to ensure the military has ample quantities of trained militia forces to support a cross-strait invasion. Despite ongoing challenges—including poor data management, inconsistent training quality, and gaps in the regulatory system—and uncertainties associated with foreign-flagged Chinese ships, this concept of operations could prove good enough to enable a large-scale amphibious assault. 

——————————

Quotes:

&gt; * …the PLA does not regard civilian shipping as a stopgap measure until more PLAN amphibious shipping can be built, but as a central feature of its preferred approach. 

&gt; * …most observers assess that the PLA would need to land 300,000 or more troops on Taiwan in total and that the PLAN amphibious fleet can only land around one division, roughly 20,000 troops, in a single lift.3 

&gt; * Skeptics will argue that this is more proof that the PLA itself does not take the invasion option seriously. The contrary view presented here is that the PLA does take these requirements seriously, but that it intends to rely on maritime militia support for large-scale combat operations, and specifically for a Taiwan invasion campaign. 

&gt; * Kennedy and Erickson have written at length on the militia’s peacetime mission to assert China’s maritime claims, centered on fishing boats that may or may not do any actual fishing. The militia forces discussed here are very different, encompassing large-capacity commercial vessels including container ships, general cargo ships, bulk carriers, tankers, roll-on-roll-off (RO-RO) ferries, barges, semisubmersibles, ocean-going tugboats, passenger ships, “engineering ships,” and others, as well as smaller vessels.13 Authors from the Army Military Transportation University noted in 2015 that the force consisted of over 5,000 ships organized into 89 militia transportation units, 53 waterway engineering units, and 143 units with other specializations.14 

&gt; * *Engineering support.* Maritime militia forces will not be passively waiting for first echelon units to open damaged ports. Tugboats, barges, salvage ships, crane ships, and dredgers will join the effort to clear obstacles, open channels, and repair docks and other facilities.28 

&gt; * *Deception and concealment.* One major advantage the PLAN derives from having hundreds of militia ships in the battlespace is the ability to hide its most valuable platforms among the radar clutter. 

&gt; * China touted its first civilian RO-RO ship built to military specifications in 1997

&gt; * A remarkably frank assessment of PLA failures in the Battle of Jinmen, 1949, cited abysmal command and control of civilian shipping among the major causes of the fiasco, a lesson the PLA should take to heart in future island landing operations.53 

&gt; * *Foreign-flag ships.* Like the rest of the global shipping industry, an ever-growing portion of the Chinese-funded commercial fleet uses flags of convenience.60 A 2018 article by officers from the Army Military Transportation University and the CMC Logistics Support Department assessed that 62.5 percent by tonnage of the shipping capacity controlled by Chinese entities in 2015 flew foreign flags.61 The authors were confident that China could justify requisitioning these ships in an emergency, despite the lack of any specific legal provision to do so, but that registering them, getting them ready for mobilization, and getting them trained properly would be a particular challenge for the NDMC and Transportation Mobilization Department at each level. 

&gt; * The PLA has spent over two decades developing the bureaucratic apparatus, laws, and regulations to organize, train, and manage this force. This author finds nothing in PLA writings on this subject to suggest this is a temporary measure, filling the gap until the Navy expands its own fleet of transports and auxiliary ships. Rather, this seems to be how Chinese leaders, civilian and military, think the PLA should function, leveraging the enormous resources of China’s civilian economy to support military operation 

&gt; * Capturing enough ports and keeping them open will almost certainly be the main challenge. If first echelon forces succeed at that, the rest of the operation has a reasonable chance of success, at least in this author’s opinion. Either way, an attempted invasion of Taiwan would not only be one of the most ambitious landing operations in history, it also undoubtedly would represent the largest ever mobilization of civilian shipping to support military operations, far outstripping Dunkirk in the number of civilian vessels and the Falklands War in tonnage. The militia logistics backbone is vital to the success of a Taiwan invasion.

_____

&gt; * In March 2020, the Marine commandant, General David Berger, published “Force Design 2030.” This controversial paper announced a significant restructuring based on the belief that “the Marine Corps is not organized, trained, equipped or postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment.” That “future operating environment” is an imagined war with China in the South Pacific—but in many ways, that hypothetical conflict resembles the real war in Ukraine.

&gt; * Berger’s strategic vision is also first-of-its-kind; in the event of a war with China, it imagines a 21st-century island-hopping campaign in which bands of 60 to 70 highly trained, lethally equipped Marines would infiltrate onto islands in the South Pacific to target the Chinese navy with advanced missile systems and other long-range weapons. The war at sea, in Berger’s vision, would be decided by a slew of Moskva-like engagements.

&gt; * Admiral James Stavridis, who spent much of his 40-plus-year Navy career in the South China Sea, is a believer in Berger’s vision. “The Army of tomorrow will look like the Marine Corps of today,” Stavridis told me. “What General Berger is doing is critical.” A truism among Marines is that the Corps must be at its most ready when America is at its least. In the 1930s, the Marine Corps pioneered the amphibious doctrine that would pave the way not only for the island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific, but also the amphibious landings that allowed the Army to liberate Europe

&gt; * Before the First World War, in the opening years of the 20th century, many militaries adhered to the cult of the offense, a then-stale belief that well-trained, determined troops would always carry the day over a defending force. In the Napoleonic Wars 100 years before, this had often proved true. But up against the 20th century’s breech-loading rifles and machine guns, the offense had become the weaker form of warfare. Tragically, it took the Marne, the Somme, and countless other bayonet charges into the teeth of chattering machine guns for the generals of that era to accept that their understanding of warfare was dated.

&gt; * “Our country can afford to have the Marine Corps overinvested in a new type of warfare that never comes to pass,” Moulton explained. “What our country cannot afford is to have the Marine Corps underinvested in a new type of warfare that does come to pass.”

&gt; * Events in Ukraine seem to validate Berger’s anti-platform-centric view of warfare, in much the same way that World War I validated those who had argued that defense had become stronger than offense. Of course, no form of warfare maintains primacy forever.

&gt; * One of the most famous countermeasures developed after the end of the First World War was France’s Maginot Line, a physical shrine to the primacy of defense. What the French failed to account for was that in two short decades, certain developments—more advanced tanks, aircraft, and combined-arms doctrine—had once again swung the balance, allowing offense to reassume its role as the dominant form of warfare. The result was a German blitzkrieg in June 1940 that simply maneuvered around the Maginot Line.",efcab1dd1f6e253d64444d05f870d33bd5583c33,True,False,,,,,0,1653227264,,0,{},i9k9qku,True,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t3_uvb8zf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9k9qku/,1653227275,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653198464.0,

From there they are well placed to move down the Dniper on either bank- The conservative move would be the west bank to cut off Kherson, but that would leave the division force many miles from a working bridge to get back to the fighting, if the Russians blow the Kherson bridge. 
Alternatively,they could move down on the east bank from Zaporizhzhi, either on the bank itself (taking back the nuke plant) or straight down to Myrne, cutting the Crimea land connection, then rolling west to trap a pocket- bt that might be too ambitious as there would be alot of flank to protect.

So the author points out that practicing to hit ships in port is a signal of intent to strike ships when conflict is not expected by China's opponent. And the outlines in the desert clearly show that this opponent is the US, because the targets are US ships.

It wouldn't be complete until at least next year as you can't just build river crossings/bridges or underpasses over/under major roads etc at the drop of a hat (at least one year and thats lots of parallel major structures actively constructed in the same time). Rolling stock also is just not available on that short notice in the quantities we're talking about (this is probably 3+ years and I'm being very optimistic about lots of manufacturers just ignoring other clients).

That number factors in imports as well. All trade would likely be disrupted if the US chose the proverbially nuclear option and escalated to a true blockade.

As far as Chinese opponents in a land war, their options are pretty constrained by geography. Nobody is fighting a full scale modern ground war over the Tibetan Plauteu and Himalayas. Fighting a Central Asian war across the Taklamakan and far from the Han heartland would be a challenge, and no other great powers have an interest in the region, Russia withstanding. Southeast Asia turns into another unwinnable guerilla war that the US absolutely won't commit troops to for obvious political reasons. China has very little capacity to project major military power far from it's borders. That basically leaves the Gobi Desert,  the Northeastern Plain, and the Korean Penisula. Two of those essentially borderlands with Russia. 

South Korea may be the one exception to my statement. Still, the US position in Korea is likely not tenable against modern China. Especially if China is the agressor and the naval war isn't over.

They fumbled all opportunities of making Ukraine a Russian ally, by supporting crappy corrupt governments that were overthrown. There were many ways of bringing Ukraine into Russian influence, but after Crimeea this was no longer possible. This brings some similarity to the Suez Crisis, when Britain and France had many opportunities to softly turn Egypt into a partner and have influence in the Arab world, but squandered it through arrogance.

Russia has pumped massive amounts of money into Ukraine in the hopes of creating pro-Russian enclaves. Just like the Americans did in Afghanistan. And just like Afghanistan, those enclaves took the money and started shooting back at them when the time came.

They went to China for support and finally got a hollow declaration of friendship that doesn't really promise anything. Yes, China is most likely helping Russia, but it's doing so as long as it completely is in theiilr benefit (cheap gas and oil probably). And I doubt that support is really that big to begin with. By weakening Russia, China is securing access to cheap resources and removing a potential regional rival.

And finally, just like Suez, they launch an illegal war with no UN support, little to no preparation and are shocked to discover that people are welcoming them with bullets instead of flowers. Did Putin really think his army would have waltzed into Kiev? After he insulted, threatened and annexed parts of Ukraine? And even if that happened, what then? Occupy and rebuilt the country just like the US tried for 20 years in Afghanistan and ended up with a humiliating retreat in the end?

[],False,,Actual-Gap-9800,,,[],,,,text,t2_36fiath0,False,False,"I understand 3rd MarDiv-if anyone- needs to restructure. But my question is what if we need to do another Incheon? The capability to do an amphibious joint forcible entry with a self-contained combined arms force is a huge tool in America's box. I'm confident in saying that we would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Unless I'm totally mistaken, the strengths of a combined arms force will generally make up for any weaknesses it may have. 

Tanks aren't obsolete- the M1 Abrams just wasn't the right tank for the USMC at this point in time. The Corps would still benefit from having some sort of mobile protected firepower that can smash a hole in the enemy's line or help out in an urban firefight- even if they switched to say a upgunned ifv from a tank. Maybe a 50mm cannon with airburst rounds, paired with Fletcher rocket launchers, smoke launchers, a mk47 40mm gmg with airburst rounds, 50 cal on the roof, 240 coax, rubber tracks, airdrop capability, scalable armor, amphibuous mobility, mine plow mount, grunt phone, and ability to launch 81 or 60mm mortars or a miclic from a crew compartment in the rear would be a do it all upgunned ifv that is not as heavy or resource intensive as an actual tank. Maybe have ""MPF companies"" or have 1 Combat Assault Battalion per Division. Majority land vehicles should be wheeled for motorized ops, with a smaller amount of slower moving, more logistically intensive tanks. 

I am a fan of the hunter killer concept though, especially when you consider the fact that the usmc expects to be operating in smaller groups in peer enemies' WEZ's. With that being said, I think it's time the usmc had their own commando course for conventional grunts. Providing high quality training that can turn line infantry into basically commandos capable of basic raids and reconnaissance behind enemy lines will gel nicely with smaller, more dispersed teams, and the emphasis on signature reduction. SOTG could handle making and teaching a Marine Commando Course, and it could be highly prized for career advancement, but not mandatory. While brilliance in infantry basics is good, this Marine commando course must focus on actual commando skills like raiding and demolitions, and not just be a reaffirmation of light infantry tactics. The amount of knowledge taught in the course must expand an individual Marines skillet, and not just reinforce concept that are already taught. The goal is to create force multipliers than can go back to their units and teach commando tactics to Marines that haven't been to the school yet. Maybe a 2 month long course would be good. 

We also need to bring back 1st LAAD Bn in Okinawa, as well as 3rd CEB as soon as possible. 3rd MLR is going to need short range manuals air coverage organic to each infantry battalion, as well as a greater amount of engineering support than the combat assault company can provide. I'm for attaching 1371's as well as 7212's to infantry battalions. When the engineers or stinger gunners pcs back to a CEB or LAAD Bn, they knowledge they bring with them from the infantry will be invaluable to propagating the spread of combat effectiveness through the division. With that being said, I still think it's a good idea to bring back assaultmen too. 

This might be a stretch, but I think maybe we should get rid of the m777's and replace them with m119s. I know the 105's can't shoot as far, nor do they have as much punch as the 155s do, but they are far more maneuverable than the 105s are. The prime mover could be a jltv instead of a 7 ton, they take up less space on ship, the range of any helo airlifting Marine artillery will be increased, and so on. Maybe there is a way to create supercharged propellant and ram jet assisted precision guided 105mm rounds like they're developing in 155mm. I wouldn't go with a barrel extension though, as you'd want to save as much weight and space as possible. The Hawkeye mobile 105mm howitzer looks interesting too, but I am suspicious of its usefulness as an ad-hoc traditional cannon if the vehicles engine fails. Then again, towed artillery peices do need prime movers. Maybe there's a way to make a cannon that can be operated standalone or attached to a hmmwv/ jltv? 

In addition, Force Recon should focus on green side reconnaissance and work on getting the in-extremis hostage rescue mission back so that they have something to do in between spying for the division. While it may not be sexy, Recon's true contribution to the rest of the Marine Corps is greenside amphibious reconnaissance. Recon first, raids second. I would even go so far as to say thay Recon should have their own RAVEN Exercise for Division forces, and that they integrate pathfinder and air assault training into BRC and RTLC if it isn't already. The skills taught at Ranger School and RSLC can be optional for Recon Marines, and instead of relying on the Army to teach a critical reconnaissance skill, pathfinder should be incorporated into BRC, RTLC, and other advanced Recon training to ensure the USMC retains such a critical combined arms capability. US Army Pathfinder School is only 3 weeks long.  Furthermore, they should also be allowed to attend MARSOF courses at the MRTC, and to augment MARSOC on an individual basis as well. In regards to BRC drops, allow Marines that fail BRC to retain the 03 MOS. In regards to recruiting, always allow Marines to volunteer in SOI, and always allow Marines to volunteer for the nearest Recon battalions indoc one thursday out of every month- including Radio Reconnaissance Marines. Throw them a bone in regards to recruiting, retention, AND operations and suddenly you've fixed the issues the recon community faces, as well as provided them with regular opportunities to enhance their skills and share their knowledge with both conventional and special forces. 

The Marine Corps should bring back Small Craft Companies, and I would even consider them creating small craft battalions and shrinking acv battalions to acv companies, so that the usmc can grow a stronger internal amphibious capability without relying on the  Navy. The idea is to avoid overtasking the acv to fill too many roles when it is currently underpowered and underarmed, or the logistics required to power them. Modern combat has proven especially deadly for slow, less armored land vehicles, and while the acv is an apc with amphibious capability, it does not have much in the way of armor, speed in the water, or powerful armament. They also create a large drain on fuel. Maybe we could sacrifice a few acvs for smaller, lighter, more nimble small unit riverine crafts, jltv's, and mrzrs instead.",56b6664dba3b87f6bcebb7cb5e8c6c039243e5a9,True,False,,,,,0,1653201187,,0,{},i9jc2fi,False,t3_usdorp,False,True,t3_usdorp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usdorp/on_the_future_of_the_marine_corps_assessing_force/i9jc2fi/,1653201197,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653172387.0,

[],False,,thisvideoiswrong,,,[],,,,text,t2_xw6ki,False,False,"I don't see that there's a close historical parallel to someone actually using a nuke. The whole reason that people have always backed down is the fear that someone might use a nuke, and the inevitable escalation that would follow. With that line crossed, it's extremely unclear where the next line is short of total annihilation. (To say nothing of the damage to the planet, of course.)

I would also say that the proliferation situation would be totally different from the current one. You're right that nukes are currently looking like a good way for a pariah government to avoid getting overthrown, because the fear of the possibility of a nuclear weapon use is stronger than any humanitarian impulses. But after a nuclear weapon is used that fear would be weaker, and the chances that such a state would actually use their weapons in a war would be much higher. Thus nuclear weapons would actually be less valuable to pariah states. On the other hand, for stable states, Taiwan, South Korea, and Iran, for example, the chances of their nuclear-armed enemies actually using nuclear weapons against them would be dramatically higher. Those states would conclude that they desperately need a nuclear deterrent, which they didn't before. And again, rather than these nuclear weapons sitting in storage to be pointed at, which is their primary purpose today, there would be a good chance of them being used during a war, just as Russia would have already done. And that's the big difference, today nuclear weapon use would only be seriously considered if annihilation of the government were already perceived as highly likely, if Russia gets away with using them then it would take dramatically less and could even become routine. And every single use would carry the risk that a difference in perceptions would lead to rapid escalation.",77ef2a7203910dc1e2ba1eeb848e4c1c6b987289,True,False,,,,,0,1653198719,,0,{},i9j927g,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t1_i9ggep1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9j927g/,1653198737,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653169919.0,

Sorry, is there any state on this planet think this isn't Chinese territory? So who is surprised that China conducts drill in Chinese sovereign soil?


&gt;In any event, the missile test range has a clear purpose. 

Hum. So if China making drills inside China shows a clear purpose, then what do military exercise in international water next to China shows? 


&gt;The U.S. should revive bases it abandoned such as Subic Bay in the Philippines, expand bases farther from the First Island Chain—namely Guam, possibly in Australia—and distribute its forces at new bases in Japan and elsewhere, perhaps Vietnam.

So China shooting stuff in like western China is a bad bad thing, but the US putting bases right next to China on Chinese borders such as Vietnam is a good thing?

What's the logic? 

&gt;The U.S. and its allies should also reconsider their resistance to strikes against the Chinese mainland. If the PLA plans to destroy U.S. ships in port—and/or targets U.S. bases throughout the Indo-Pacific—it will gain a decisive strategic advantage over the U.S. as a war expands. A “long war” in this circumstance may favor China, with its more robust ship repair facilities, rather than the U.S. Chinese military doctrine hardly needs encouragement to escalate, but U.S. and allied war plans that rule out striking Chinese land targets and disavow rehearsing for such eventualities encourage the likelihood of escalation in a Pacific conflict.

China lacks the capacity to strike US mainland targets as easily as US could strike, though it would still be difficult for US air assets to degrade Chinese defenses first before they can hit the juicy targets. But I suppose ship based missiles has the capacity to do so. But this brings the question, would a great power respond to a strike on their cities? I think most people's response is yes. I'm with most people. 

Then the only question remains how much does the US want to exchange fire and escalate for Taiwan.",4d760d3faa57f94b274dfbdf1768bca48fd61fc2,True,False,,,,,0,1653187218,,0,{},i9irj31,False,t3_uuzzq8,False,True,t3_uuzzq8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuzzq8/china_is_telegraphing_its_military_intent_time_to/i9irj31/,1653187234,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653158418.0,

&gt; The Russian defence ministry said the images distributed by Ukraine were ""another staged performance by the Kyiv regime"", and Russia's chief investigator on Monday ordered a probe on the basis that Ukraine had spread ""deliberately false information"" about Russian armed forces in Bucha

General David Berger wants Marines to operate in small, self-sufficient, highly mobile and highly lethal teams across remote islands and to have the capability to apply long-range fires against PLAN assets, including surface ships, aircraft, and even submarines.

I think the Chinese government will not hesitate to strike U.S. military bases across the Western Pacific. That's exactly what they're training for.

&gt; We are Russian, American and European experts who are members of the
&gt; Russia-NATO Military Risk Reduction Dialogue in Europe. We express
&gt; our utmost concern over the biggest crisis on the European continent
&gt; since World War II and call for the following urgent action:  


&gt; All parties should immediately and unconditionally agree to a
&gt; ceasefire, take coordinated measures to de-escalate the situation,
&gt; and negotiate a political settlement.  


&gt; Cooperation should be established on the urgent humanitarian
&gt; aspects of the situation in the conflict zones.  


&gt; All the parties concerned must show the highest degree of
&gt; responsibility and restraint in matters relating to nuclear weapons,
&gt; refraining from threatening nuclear rhetoric and actions. Russian-
&gt; American negotiations on strategic stability should resume.  


&gt; Additional measures should be agreed to prevent military incidents
&gt; between the US/NATO and Russia and to establish direct contacts

--------------------

&gt; * A military exercises in the manner it plans to fight. This was true for Russia before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, true of the United States before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and is true of China today. A missile test range the People’s Liberation Army is using in western China demonstrates its combat intentions toward Taiwan. The U.S. should reckon for this, and other information on PLA force posture, in its military planning.

&gt; * Russia’s yearlong force and equipment buildup, and its force structure, signaled its intentions toward Ukraine. Its plan was irrational, but that it “abandoned” its doctrinal principles is not clear. 

&gt; * Russia’s air force was not designed to conduct a broad interdiction campaign akin to the Coalition air campaign in the 1991 Gulf War. The modern Russian air force, the VVS, is, like its Soviet predecessor, designed to control the airspace over the front line, conduct interdiction missions at a limited operational depth, and prioritize ground targets in a tactical, rather than theater-wide, capacity. 

&gt; * Indeed, the American “playbook” was apparent after 1991 and 2003. Build up overland, conduct a long-term air campaign, and use ground forces with speed and violence to collapse enemy cohesion and destroy its capacity. U.S. adversaries took note. The anti-access area denial strategy that is imitated from the Persian Gulf to the West Pacific was born.

&gt; * Public-facing PLA exercises are stage-managed, and the PLA conducted few flexible live-fire exercises before recent military reforms conducted under President Xi Jinping, meaning older exercises offer only a limited window into Chinese military thinking. 

&gt; * However, open-source analysis has identified a major testing range in Xinjiang. Unsurprisingly, the CCP has used Uighur territory as a military test area—providing a clear window into PLA strategy against Taiwan.

&gt; * The first range, identified in October 2021, has two objects, both of which have identical dimensions to U.S. Navy warships: one an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the other a Ford-class carrier, complete with cutaways for the aft flight deck. The second range, identified this month, lies eight miles south of the first. This range replicates a port, including three piers with a surface combatant alongside.

&gt; * Both test sites are part of a larger ballistic missile testing area in the Taklamakan Desert.

&gt; * The PLA hopes to target enemy ships in port, not only at sea during combat.

&gt; * Training missiles to target ships in port therefore has a clear military purpose: The PLA’s rocket forces can target U.S. and allied warships as hostilities commence, hoping to deliver a “knockout punch” against Washington’s Indo-Pacific alliance.

&gt; * First, America must revamp its “superbase” structure, under which it concentrates its military forces in a handful of gargantuan facilities to cut costs.

&gt; * Second, the U.S. should accelerate investment in missile defenses.

&gt; * The U.S. and its allies should also reconsider their resistance to strikes against the Chinese mainland.
