Recently read a book, it is available in English and the Title is Orderly and Humane, by R. M Douglas. It describes the ethnic Cleansing of up to 17 million Germans in East Prussia parts of western Czech republic, Volga Germans and more. Many died, some tortured on there walk back to Germany. The initial welcome was muted, by 47 hunger was still rampant not enough food for just the continental Germans. Günter Grass the famous author remarked when I think of Americans I think of how they made us starve, read about the  Morgenthau Plan. Grass talked eloquently about living on 800 cal per day. The eastern Germans organized but guilt and lethargy prevented them from a major voice in post war period. I was married to a Palestinian Christian and her parents story about still having the key to there home in Haifa 50 years later reminded me of stories reading the book. In most of these stories of ethnic cleansing the world just wants to forget. My Mother was sponsored by relatives in the US and made it to America thank god.

I moved to Europe in mid life lived in Berlin for  year re learning German. I actually found it Easier to gain residency in Switzerland because I was highly skilled in a high demand area.

I will restate it for you. The US Constitution gives the legislature branch power to spend US money on basically anything it wants to spend it on. It does not put any restrictions on foregin aid, military or otherwise. (Heck, the Founding Fathers were acutely aware of the critical role French and other foreign aid played in the American Revolution. Are Rand and you proposing they would have hamstrung their new republic by making foreign military aid verbotten? Not a chance.) The Constitution also gives the executive branch the power to manage the might of the US military in any eay it sees fit within the constraints of legislative approval to wage war, which is a legal gray area not relevant to the current geopolitic.

Neither branch is doing anything remotely unconstitutional right now. Your so-called ""principled statesman"" is falsely wrapping his Neville Chamberlain arguments in a Constitutional wrapper because he knows Fox News viewers and people who don't actually know what's in the Constitution will buy his snake oil.

His only principles are based on whether legislation benefits his electability or his campaign donors. Obviously he has a lot of people fooled though. He seems to have fooled himself into believing that he is responsible for the third branch of the US government. That would be judicial branch, responsible for interpreting the law, if you aren't clear.

To cede a part of Ukraine as an escape tactic. It would've maybe been an option before the bombs hit. But Zelensky and as far as I know, all Ukranians won't cede a part of their land to a tyrant.

Their leaders/personnel won't want to risk their own lives if they see a way out, if the uprising is big enough it could well mean the police and army turn on the government to secure their own futures.

It's really difficult to predict, you can only speculate based on what you'd do. I don't see a way out for the government, the police and army do have a way out; withdraw from Ukraine, install a western leaning military backed government and rebuild from there. All blame can be put on Putin and lower ranked conscripts, power can be consolidated between the currently surviving generals and the civilian population kept in check.

What is ""Russian"" in this sentence - citizen of russian federation, citizen of LDNR, russian in Ukraine, pro-russian ukranian? 

&gt;I dont see any Russian cities in smoking ruins.

Because Russia actually defends them? :) 

Doneck had plenty of dead children and plenty of ruins - and LDNR is being shelled all last 3 months aswell. For them what started in 2014 haven't ended. 

640,000 russian citizens live in LDNR, by the way.

You mean USA that sponsors nazis (after failure of sponsoring AFghanistan) and brings war to Europe, trying to make it be ""till last ukranian""?

&gt;So if you feel so damn strongly about your countries moral responsibilties than advocate for an international tribunal so you can state your case there instead of on Reddit. 

Just a reminder, that for example european human rights court denied all 5588 cases from LDNR. 

Stop living in illusion that NATO countries have working laws. They are calling neonazis under swastika heroes at the moment, give them money and trained them for 8 years. If for you it isn't obvious that something is very wrong in this - it's pointless to talk to you.

&gt;the reason NATO expanded, was the Russians...They wanted to come west

Where did Russia wanted to come - in Czechia 1999 or in Slovenia 2004? 

This is complete nonsense, NATO pushed agressive expansion of military union - that's a fact. 

NATO is imperialist murderers, now they want to expand to pacific ocean region - also Russian threat there? :) That's not defense, that's offense - and NATO didn't have any defense missions, only offense missions.

&gt;All of those countries including Ukraine, Georgia knew that this day would come.

Because they've been hooked by NATO countries. Plenty of money, puppet politicians - remember Nulland leaked phone talks about Maidan, Poroshenko bowing to NATO leaders, Saakashvili eating his tie while talking to US president... 

USA use them as cannon meat to fight Russia (or at least contain russian influence). 

&gt;How many Ukrainian or Georgian invasions of Russia?

Ukraine attacked LDNR, destroyed it's constitution, brought NATO to our borders and so on.

Georgia shelled Osetian-Abkhazian minorities and russian peacekeepers [first](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-russia-report-idUSTRE58T4MO20090930), restarting ethnical war. 

How do you come to discuss these things not knowing ANYTHING about it? That's so... american?

&gt;Russia is doing the world a favor by invading Ukraine and claim that Russia has some authority or right to pull this shit, just like in 2014.

Russia has absolute authority to interfere in this, thanks to article 51 UN about collective safety. 

Just as it's rightful to throw away everything pro-nazi in Ukraine.

&gt;See at least I have the unbiased ability to look at things objectively.

You don't, don't have illusion about that. 

Not a single of your media shows russian/LDNR point of view. Reddit is censored, Twitter is censore, youtube is censored, facebook is censored and so on. 

You are about to end up in demparty pseudoliberal fascist state, which will most likely spread on EU aswell. Good luck with new anti-disinformation comitees. By the way proposed head of this department worked for Zelenskiy in 2019 - pure coincidence, sign of independent elections and so on.

&gt;you probably end up in the back of a van with a hood on you

That's what CNN tells you? Do FBI come for people and drive them away in vans btw? For example if they did something wrong to demparty? :)

You are basically judging us by yourself.

&gt; I am able to speak freely.

Yeah, that's why Julian Assange who spoke against US war crimes gonna get sent to USA and get 175 years of prison.

Because freedom of speech, democracy and fair laws. 

Or Snowden who spoke against giant violation of human rights... 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't make joke of yourself with this phrase, cmon. 

&gt;and admit to the world that Russia is in fact the villain

Because I know the situation well enough and don't think so. 

And definetely not NATO countries should teach me morals, imperialist butchers. Go send some money to people with swastika, I've heard buffallo guy [wore the same](https://i.imgur.com/XIASQom.jpg).

&gt;You have destabilized all of europe and threatened food security for a billion people

No, your destabilizations started before, both in Europe and NA.

No idea why you've decided to make it worse by applying illegal (non-allowed by UN) sanctions on Russia. 

All responsibility for your and others problems is on USA, EU and satellites. 

&gt;all the while killing at least 50K civilians, 400K in camps, and 6 million refugees

Watch less CNN man, it's simply absurd. 

So far in camps are only 6,700 of Ukranian POW from AFU, Azov etc.

&amp;#x200B;

You've pushed NATO to our borders, you funded nazis, you supported LDNR war - you are responsible for any consequences of this conflcit. ANY.

&gt;YOU DID NOT MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE, YOU MADE IT WORSE EXPONENTIALLY.

Who is making a world a better place? USA by helping Azov, Right Sector and C14? Let's ask Doneck miners about that? :)

You are talking self-entitled nonsense.

&gt;You literally point to the spec in your fellow mans eye clouding his vision, while ignoring the rafter in your own.

What about you? 

Didn't you deny NATO guilty in the beginning of your message?

Operation cyclone? Condor? Gladio? Vietnam? Iraq? Syria? Afghanistan? Yugoslavia?
