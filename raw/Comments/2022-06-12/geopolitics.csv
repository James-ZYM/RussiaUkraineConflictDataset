Russia is trying to sell stolen Ukrainian grain to poorer countries and the US has told these countries to not accept stolen the shipments. On one hand the countries don't want to go against the US for fear they will be sanctioned, on the other hand they don't want to starve. The US isn't sanctioning grain shipments and likely won't but something will have to give. Either NATO allows stolen grain to be sold which angers Ukraine, or NATO enforces a Russian grain ban constricting supply. Or they could also just turn a blind eye to it and give a slap on the wrist to countries importing stolen grain.

&gt; The biggest uncertainty is Turkey (IMHO). And frankly, this war has helped Turkey increase its leverage by a fair bit.

How so? I believe Russia will greatly consume Ukraine's southern coastline by the end of this war. Turkey will then have to contend with Russian power projection on the Black Sea.

The CCP naval capacity has exploded over the last 10 years and more so last 5. the PLA navy has 75 amphibious landing ships, which dwarfs everyone else. The US currently has a few larger Marine Assault ships, but the Chinese just rolled out several similar sized ships.  
The Chinese strategy is designed with the US in mind to become involved.  
  
A2AD: Area access and denial. Long range heavy anti-ship systems that's purpose is to keep our carriers and some advanced destroyers out at distance.  
  
Build up of South China Sea to extend their range of control and partially account for the US ""Straights of Malacca"" strategy which is sealing off the narrow waters between Sg/Malaysia/Indonesia from oil shipments from the ME.  
  
Fleets of newer destroyers that while it's safe to say are not up to the US abilities, would still be a threat that would have to be taken out to allow US Fleets and supplies to the East Coast of Taiwan in the event of conflict.  
When? Well, doing Marine landings are not easy and Taiwan has had decades to build networks of forts/bunkers near the shore, tunnels, hidden obstacles to seal off roads if forces landed. The land is also defender friendly with big changes in elevation in many areas just after the shoreline.  
I believe China also wants further energy security prior to the shxt show, pipelines of Russia oil/gas, more connections to Kazakhstan, maybe a firm buddy in the M.E(Iran, Pakistan deep water port possible too).  
More than likely, China would launch the largest missile barrage against every airfield, flat/harden road(Taiwan has some dual purpose roads designed for emergency landings), radar, radio tower and might try to cut undersea internet cables and cyber attack TW.  
IMO: China won't go for it until they are forced (Tw declares independence) internal pressures threaten the CCP and they look for a great national cause or we come up near that D-Day.  
Result:  
If Chinese troops land and are able to get supplies/men to from China, that's it. If Taiwan repulses the main attack, the CCP would most likely be eaten from within by their own commie nationalists.

Beach landings are notoriously hard to plan and implement, and the straights of Taiwan are notoriously rough waters aside from a few seasonal months.

[],False,,TrinityAlpsTraverse,,,[],,,,text,t2_7q6sqy,False,False,"I'd argue that the Japanese slowdown was less about Western intervention and more about structural issues in the Japanese economy.

The biggest issue for Japan, as it will be for China, is that their consumption as a percent of GDP was very low compared to other economies. If you're an economy that's trying to build a industrial manufacturing base, this is a good thing because low consumption by definition means high savings, which allows for the capital investment in building everything you need to have an advanced industrial economy. 

Neither country needed strong domestic consumption because they could export their excess productive to other countries. 

Where Japan got into trouble, and I think where China will as well, is once you reach the ceiling on your economic growth being fueled by exporting manufactured products (I'd argue we're there with China as manufacturing has become a smaller part of their economy over the past decade), you have three options. Either grow by rapidly expanding your total debt to GDP (which China has chosen to do over the past decade), accept a period of slow growth (like Japan did once their economy had no more ability to absorb debt), or greatly increase domestic consumption to provide new demand.

China has made a lot of noise about increasing domestic demand. The problem is that it is very politically difficult. Increasing consumption as a percent of total GDP means you must increase household income, and that would come at the expense of the government and government run companies. To fix the Chinese economy and prevent a long period of slow growth, the very people and entities that would be negatively impacted by the correction have to implement and oversee that correction.

[],False,,TrinityAlpsTraverse,,,[],,,,text,t2_7q6sqy,False,False,"&gt;Of course, any given decade will present serious challenges.  That was true of 2012-2022.  China didn't collapse.  Some predict that by 2032 China's economy will be largest even in nominal GDP\[4\], although with the dampening caused by zero-COVID, those growth predictions might not quite pan out.  Obviously China is not going to keep growing out to infinity, but neither is it likely they'll fold like a house of cards.  If you're going to face difficulties and setbacks, it sure doesn't hurt to do it with all the economic advantages they've amassed.  China is hardly alone in facing the ""demographic crisis"" of an aging population.  Other's are in even worse shape (Japan, Korea) -- no one's talking about those countries collapsing (that I've heard).

I think the biggest challenge China will face in this next decade is how past rapid increases of total debt load and possible unproductive investment impact future GDP growth.

Before the 2000's China grew by filling a keep global need with inexpensive manufacturing labor (and did an amazing job of it). Since then, to fuel continuing GDP growth, China has massively increased their total debt to GDP to fund construction and infrastructure project. If those investments lead to increasing amounts of future economic activity, they're productive and positive investments. The danger with a supply side system like China, where GDP growth is seen as a policy output and not the result of natural economic activity, is that government pressure for growth leads to a very inefficient and unproductive use of capital. 

My guess is that this decade is the decade where that unproductive investment catches up with China and they have a prolonged period of low growth. This won't be anything like a collapse that some of the wilder commentators predict. China will still be a large and important nation. But unproductive investment has a price, and I think that price will be an adjustment period that will take the form of a long period of slow growth.

I don't think this will mean that China will have to entirely scale back its global ambitions. More likely it will mean that China will have to accept being the #2 economic power for a good while longer. And this is nothing to be ashamed of for China, the US took centuries to reach their current level of economic growth.

I would disagree with this.

China has roughly the same demographic mix now as Japan had in the 90s. That was the decade Japan's economy effectively stopped growing. House prices collapsed and still haven't returned to their 90s levels. And since then Government debt has quadrupled relative to GDP, and benefits spending on pensioners has gone through the roof. As a result the quality of life of Japanese citizens has completely stagnated. 

Difference is, Japan was already by that stage an incredibly rich country with one of the highest per capita GDPs on the planet. They can put up with a bit of stagnation because their quality of life was incredibly high relative to everywhere else.

China is not like that. It's citizens earn barely a 5th of what Japan's do. And all of the wealth - what little they have - is funneled into housing partly due to the CCP's stock market controls. If China suffers a similar housing collapse to Japan - not unlikely considering all the empty apartment blocks being built - the fallout will be 100 times greater.

I'm not saying China definitely won't continue to grow, but the risks are there and they are potentially existential for the CCP.",187be91e473735bb425912b5d2702690fc438673,True,False,,,,,0,1655045511,,0,{},ic3cslt,False,t3_v9vmyw,False,True,t1_ic1zbu9,/r/geopolitics/comments/v9vmyw/what_do_you_think_will_happen_to_china_in_the/ic3cslt/,1655045522,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1655016711.0

China has *never* done well as a Naval power and is stuck as a land power (the world’s highest mountains to the south, trackless deserts to the east and Vietnam to the south-east and it bears repeating that invading Vietnam is no small task).  China is in a cage, and historically it stays there/doesn’t get out.  China can export its currency-generating products and import food and fuel only at the whim of, in descending order, America, Japan, Russia, The Philippines, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand.

Regarding jobs being replaced, that may negatively impact taxes collected and may require more tax revenue (that might not be possible to generate) through retraining costs and welfare.

Regarding VAT (and any tax for that matter), there is a limit to how much tax revenue you can generate from an economy. First, there is the demographic decline issue. Less people means less transactions. Less transactions for goods and services means less VAT collected. Second, even ignoring that, raising VAT for example wont neccessarily raise more tax. Every increase in a tax has an impact on economic activity. For example, if you raised VAT to something crazy like 1000%, your economy would die. 1000% x 0 is still 0. On the flip side, lowering VAT to something ridiculous like 0.01% would drive more transactions/purchases because people can afford more, but you'd be taking a smaller cut of a larger pie.

If you'd asked me this question (""... in the next decade?"") in June 2012, I probably would have said, ""Jeez, I don't know, but probably even more influential and powerful than today.""  And that would have been right.

So, being neither an expert, nor a possessor of a crystal ball, for my answer today I'll pick the same thing.  ""Even more influential and powerful than today"".  Which is saying something, because between 2012-&gt;2022, they gained the largest economy (by PPP GDP) ^(\[1\]), were the organizing force for the largest trading block (RCEP), which the US is not part of^(\[2\]), and surpassed USA as the wealthiest country^(\[3\])

Of course, any given decade will present serious challenges.  That was true of 2012-2022.  China didn't collapse.  The prediction now is that that by 2032 China's economy will be largest even in nominal GDP^(\[4\],) although with the dampening caused by zero-COVID, those growth predictions might not quite pan out.  Obviously China is not going to keep growing out to infinity, but neither is it likely they'll fold like a house of cards.  That economic power will enable an increase in diplomatic and military power if China choses to take it, and at least under the current leadership, that's exactly where they're going.

If China attains the ""premier power"" status that USA had after WWII, one wouldn't be surprised if they'd be actively re-casting the world economic order to their own liking -- just as the USA after WWII.  You can already see it happening in Africa^(\[5\]), Latin America^(\[6\]), and wherever the Belt and Road Initiative shows up^(\[7\])

I'm pretty sure I'll burn out on reddit and delete my account before 2032 to come chat about how right or wrong I guessed. :P

When I make posts like this, I sometimes get accused of being a *wumao*.  Therefore I've included western media references for the points I made.  I welcome your disagreement, though!

Russia controls the Black Sea, which means they now control all the grain routes to Asia (maritime and rail) and with the Ukrainian industrial and agricultural lands absorbed into the Russian economic machine, they will control a huge percentage of the world's food supply.

Crimea is crucial for strategic reasons (i.e Sevastopol) so I disagree about it being a net negative. Control over the Black Sea is integral to Russian national security, which is why Crimea has been held tightly by Russia for centuries. 

The anti-Russian hype train is already winding down (people have enough worries domestically to care for too long) and I predict that European gripes with Russia will subside over the years once the Ukraine campaign is over.

[],False,,Artur_Mills,,,[],,,,text,t2_zmeah,False,False,"&gt;We don't think it is one man, but if Putin is defeated so is his ideology

What ideology would replace Putinism thay isnt anti west? The only ""pro-west"" is Yeltsinism, and that highly unpopular in Russia.

&gt;If Putinism is defeated so is the idea of Russia being able to be a lone great power that can compete with the US, China, and EU. 

Thats big assumption and big claim.

&gt;Contrary to Putins propaganda, most Russians do see themselves as decidedly European ethnically and culturally. Which they in fact simply are.

But they see themselves Russian first and not part of the West.

&gt;But the real reason I think Russia long term will side with the EU if Putinism is defeated is that the EU is essentially confederacy that allows the Russians to be active equals in it alongside France and Germany rather than a clear Chinese pet with questionable freedoms.

Germany and France berate Russia, send equipment to Ukraine to kill russian soldiers, sanctions Russia for hundreds of times, part of NATO that Russian fear more than anything. Why would russians betray China that hasnt done anything to them? 

&gt;Russians will never trust China and even now their 'alliance' is more propaganda than reality.
