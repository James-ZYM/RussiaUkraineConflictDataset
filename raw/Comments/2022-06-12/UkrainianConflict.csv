It's the smart move tactically - they already have troops on the other side of the river in the north and south wrapping down to surround the city on the other side.  If they cut the bridges they can trap these troops so they can't resupply and can't escape to fight again later, then once they're done on this side leave a small force to defend and go the long way around to assault the other city from the west with the rest of the troops.  

And the troops in the other city will also be trapped, so basically the Russians will have killed or captured something like 20,000 Ukrainian troops in one battle - which is a big hit when Ukraine is claiming they only have 10,000 dead so far.  I think it was a big mistake for Ukraine not to do an orderly retreat when they had a chance, it slows down the Russians but at a massive cost in lives and these are supposedly the most experienced soldiers.",bc8619971993d492985d5b12a886690ffe9b9312,True,False,,,,,0,1655075448,,0,{},ic54evk,False,t3_vaw60z,False,True,t1_ic50twp,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vaw60z/on_the_morning_of_june_12_russian_army_destroyed/ic54evk/,1655075461,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655046648.0,

The war has been going on for fought 110 days, typically in western militaries, boot camp/basic training is 10 weeks. Logic deduces that massive mobilization probably occurred to full effect several weeks after the war started. Logic would then also go on to the conclusion that around literally right now, meaning a week ago, or in the coming weeks, i am hopeful that thousands of people will now be coming out of basic and headed to the front. This is all speculative, but logic is a very profound system; and I believe that we may be shortly seeing a massive amount of (capable) reinforcements headed to the front - which is where my hopefulness on the massive counter-offensive resides. I have seen the minor pushbacks from the Ukrainians and have been monitoring their gains/losses in maps but only via the BBC. 

I understand what you are getting at with your reservations on whether or not Ukraine can mount a significant counter attack, but I also truly hope that the hypothetical influx of reinforcements (I have no clue if This is actually happening, I just know that if I myself were Zelensky, I would have ordered these preparations to begin on Feb 24th) is going to come soon. However, veterancy and combat experience is an intangible factor that is not lost on me, and I would also harbor a little bit of reserved optimism about any newly created (division? I don’t even know how the Ukrainian military is subdivided) I’ll just use the term division as a unit of about 15k soldiers - meaning active fighters, not rear echelon type or support/logistics - if true mobilization occurred back on Feb 24, reason deduces that there could potentially be tens of newly created divisions ready to go… it would be like Operation Uranus in reverse.

It's either a rather dramatic case of failure to think ahead, or the left hand not talking to the right.  Who can say at this point.

&gt; I personally do not quite understand why they don’t retreat from that area though...

I wish I had a good explanation for it.  We probably won't know the real reason for some time, with the benefit of hindsight and more knowledge of troop movements and deployment strength.  It could be anything from a calculated move to a complete mistake.

&gt; If the Russians are as depleted as most people are saying they are, then it would be logical to assume that it is only a matter of time before Ukraine can mount significant counter offensive operations.

Ukraine has been running a series of smaller counteroffensive operations for some time, over the last few weeks they've liberated a number of villages (I seem to recall reading something like 20 in one day late last week), as well as a [big win in Kherson](https://www.newsweek.com/arestovich-ukraine-russia-zelensky-1712575) recently.  I suspect Ukraine will be taking this slow and methodical, as they can't afford to screw up like the Russians have been doing.  A larger counteroffensive doesn't seem like it would play to their strengths at this time, given how much success they've had running this as using asymmetrical methods, and we already know the Ukrainians are running low on ammo (or so they're reporting, though it could just as easily be a counterintelligence ploy).  

&gt; Has the whole nation been mobilized?

I suspect it has, though mobilization of reserve troops often involves a retraining and refresher time, as you can't just take someone in the reserves from a desk job and drop them straight into combat.  I imagine many of those reservists have been the ones going to training facilities in the west of Ukraine to get brought up to speed on the NATO weapons systems they are being supplied with.",2e875cf2dd81ccfc8558a8b2664aef0266414cbc,True,False,,,,,0,1655073658,,0,{},ic50ukm,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic4wvc2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic50ukm/,1655073674,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655044858.0,

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

""It was his time with the Red Army in what had been Prussia that eventually gave birth to a long poem, published as Prussian Nights in Russian (in Paris) in 1974, in German in 1976, and in English in 1977. The poem is not exactly a celebration of the achievements of the Soviet army; the word “condemnation” is not too strong. The army indiscriminately raped and pillaged its way across Prussia on its march to Berlin. Everything and anything was allowed; this was payback time for what the Nazis had done to Russia. What many of the Red Army soldiers proved was that they were no better than their Nazi counterparts.'

You underestimate Russian state propaganda. He already has much of the country convinced that the war is going just as planned. 

&gt;You think (and other French, German and Italian politicians) that you can give bones to the head of most powerful mafia structure in the history and he will be satisfied.

You really don't understand. It's not about giving him anything. It's about making it look like russia get something out of it. Everyone will know that Russia lost and failed to achieve what they wanted. But Russian state media will spin it differently. 

Putin is a strongman dictator with a big ego. A dictator must appear strong (at home ) more than anything else. 

Look how many Americans still think they won the Vietnam war. They'll say things like : ""we accomplished all our military objectives"" ""We didn't really lose"" ""they lost more soldier than us"" ect ect.

But they still lost. And Vietnam didn't give them anything. USA abandoned the war because it was pointlessly costly in both lives and money. Being a democracy their strategical decision weren't at the wim of a single man's ego. Thus they left. Logically , Russia should do the same. They have nothing to gain from this war. It's pure propaganda. But Putin doesn't want to lose face. 

The goal is to avoid more Ukrainian death.

Not to surrender ukraine's territory. 

To pretend otherwise is to spew Russian propaganda to sow disunity the West.

&gt;Czechoslovakia was given to appease one of the previous tyrants and he walked in Paris within few years.

You clearly don't understand once again despite multiple people telling you this. The goal is not to surrender territory. I repeat. No one is asking ukraine to give territory to Russia. 

Read again what I wrote. It's honestly getting pathetic.

&gt;The only possible saving face is that Putin will be removed and this bullshit will be blamed on him.

This is an unlikely scenario in wich countless ukrainians lives are lost.

The goal of the west should be to save Ukraine. Not ruin Russia. 

We can do both true. However the moment we have to choose between the two.

Because Russia thought it will loose its grip on Ukraine they attacked it. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. It seized Crimea openly and the Donbas covertly. Most of the deaths in the Donbass happened in the first clashes. Do you contest any of this?

Since 2014 the Ukraine army has a frontline with the so called ""separatist"" inside their own territory - which were indirectly run and supported by Russia (as they do with parts of Georgia and Moldovia). If you care to search for it you will find accounts of people how they were thrown out of their homes in Donbass and Luhansk by the Russians. 

The Russians are the aggressors. Thousends of lives could have been spared if they would have decided not to attack in 2014 or to pull out of Ukraine since then or not to start this invasion (and yes that whats it called if you send thousends of soldiers, heavy weapons, tanks, planes, etc. Into a foreign country to occupy it). Millions of people would not have been displaced. 

Russia shelled civillian areas in Ukraine (most prominent example is Mariupol). Russia does not care about civilian casulties. Otherwise they would have stopped by now. So how can you think of them as a saviour? From what? From some 900-5000 Azov people who didn't exist before 2014?

If the Russians are as depleted as most people are saying they are, then it would be logical to assume that it is only a matter of time before Ukraine can mount significant counter offensive operations.

Because ending the war militarily, atleast to me, means either marching all the way to Moscow and beyond which is most likely not going to happen or Ukraine to fall, which I hope doesn't happen.

So to end the war, at some point, Russia and Ukraine will have to negotiate a peace if the war is to end. Beating the russian army, even kicking them out of all Ukrainian territory doesn't automatically end the war if the russians want it to go on.
They can just go to their border, which the Ukraine can't really go over for a number of reasons, and keep the conflict going if they so desire. Might be stupid of them to do that, but unless a sucessful peace negotiation (where we are back at the diplomatic solution) happens, the conflict will go on.

390,[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"&gt; But now I think the US May be top tier...

It's not without reason, and your previous considerations may not have been without cause.  In the wake of 9/11, US intelligence agencies had found that they were relying far too much on signals intelligence, and not enough on the capabilities of people on the ground.  Since then, however, there has been a grand diversification of capabilities as a reaction, and now it would be foolish to underestimate the US's intelligence gathering capabilities.  Between satellite intel, *vast* SIGINT capabilities, in-person operations, and dramatic improvements in counterintelligence doctrine, the US intelligence services across the board are doing all kinds of amazing work that nobody hears about until 10-20 years later.  We can make some educated guesses on the basis of what is occurring in Ukraine about certain aspects of our intelligence gathering capabilities, but once more, we have to chalk some of the knowledge we have up to Russian incompetence.  Follow me here.

So, encrypted comms.  Every military worthy of the name has them.  The US has had it forever, and has ensured that all NATO countries are equipped with encryption that meets a common standard that's a tough nut to crack.  Russia has an encrypted comms system too, but the problem is that it relies on a civilian 3G cell network to function...  which was immediately targeted by the Russians in Ukraine during the opening hours of the war, leading to Russian C&amp;C falling apart as units advancing into Ukraine suddenly found themselves in the dark, so to speak.  They ended up relying on unencrypted shortwave radios to handle their transmissions, which has led to not only ordinary Ukrainians hurling abuse at them from their own radios, and jamming by way of playing the Ukrainian national anthem on repeat, but also some...  [unusual trolling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t873qh/pirates_are_broadcasting_troll_faces_on_russian/)  It would be foolish to think that this has not been used to broadcast misinformation to Russian troops as well, for instance, calling in about unit ambushes that never occurred, calling for artillery strikes upon Russian positions (or mere open fields, just to waste shells), etc.  

&gt; Meaning, was it a continuous line of defenses on either side like in WW1 with defense emplacements?

Unlikely.  Modern warfare is far more mobile than that, and it has been known since roughly WW1 that static defenses are the graveyards of armies.  More likely we're looking at a series of forward observers and highly mobile mechanized recon units, as well as drones both large and small, reporting back to camouflaged artillery units whenever they find something worth blowing up on the other side.  In this kind of fight over open ground, the ""front"" is an ambiguous and fluid thing, entirely dependent upon what assets on either side have been found and destroyed, and how far reinforcement, rebuild, and resupply is.

&gt; I hope that Ukraine is in a controlled retreat mode, conducting a fighting retreat while inflicting as much pain and casualties as possible on the Russians while hopefully sparing their own resources.

That was actually what occurred in the opening days of the fight, a controlled withdrawal leading to the Russians overextending themselves, stretching themselves so thin that their logistics and supply could not keep up, leading to those 40 mile long convoys we saw.  Since 2014 the Ukrainians have been consulting with NATO advisors on how best to counter a Russian invasion, and that was exactly what was needed given the Russian logistics limitations.  NATO has been wargaming this exact scenario for decades, and it shows in how well the Ukrainians pulled it off.

She confirms what you’re saysing and she showed me pictures of beautiful mansions that were stolen by Russians.  God knows where they sent the actual inhabitants. There was one mansion that had two lions on either side of the stairwell. The lions had some historical significance to their local culture but I can’t remember what it was.  However, the Russian inhabitants covered them with boxes. She said that most of the time the Russians remove and destroy them by melting the gold or just destroying if not a profitable material. 

They’re fucking animals and they behave like Nazis while claiming they’re fighting Nazis. 

I think Ukraine allowed 2014 to happen because it was so discreet and it wasn’t perceived as a truly existential threat. In the meantime, they’ve been trained in western tactics and revolutionized their armed forces to where they would run laps around the Soviet military doctrine. Then Putin makes it undeniable that he literally wants to take Ukraine and make it so it’s like they never existed as a people and culture.  The cocksucker even stated this at as a goal. If that doesn’t declare him as a genocidal maniac I don’t know what does.  

I really believe that the Ukrainian mindset has been permanently changed and solidified. Whereas many in the eastern part of the country had shared lineage, linguistics, etc with western Russia, now there is only the understanding that Russia is an invading, genocidal wasteland. Even if the Ukranian conventional military falls due to endless Russian troops/equipment, this enduring mindset means there will be an unrelenting insurgence in the aftermath. 

Russia, for this reason, will never be able to conquer Ukraine. They have turned an otherwise peaceful people, a people who even took the 2014 Russian transgressions without major reactions, into a proud warrior nation that will laugh and joke right before and right after killing Russians. They will show endless compassion to helpless animals and their countrymen alike even if death awaits them. This is the fighting spirit that cannot be forced, paid for or taught - the Russians do not and will never have it in this conflict. This is what analysts do not understand if they simply go off of size/funding of the armies and territory taken when saying who the victor will be.

There’s a sudden pop as a cluster munition bursts over the battlefield, leaving behind a smattering of dark puffs as submunitions rain down on the village’s defenders. It’s followed by another seconds later

The production and use of cluster munitions have been banned by an international treaty that went into effect in 2010, but that doesn’t mean very much: Neither the United States nor Russia — the world’s biggest arms dealers — have signed the accord. Neither has Ukraine. Cluster munitions spread submunitions — small explosives called bomblets — over a wide area, and are intended to kill or maim personnel and destroy vehicles and equipment. Many of the bomblets don’t explode as designed when they hit the ground. Those unexploded bomblets will be found for years afterward.

Sometimes children mistake them for toys.

“Their actions are not as haphazard as before,” Oleksandr Motuzianyk, the spokesman for Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, tells me back in Kyiv when I ask about changing Russian tactics. “They’re using combined arms and air support more effectively.”

The simple fact is that despite its missteps, Russia has taken a lot of land since the invasion started. Ukraine, lacking Russia’s deep reserves of manpower — however unskilled or untrained — cannot recapture it without superlative military technology. Meanwhile, the Russians are pushing ahead: Motuzianyk says their strategy is to encircle troops defending Severodonetsk.

The population of Severodonetsk was more than 100,000 before the invasion in February. Local officials and aid workers estimate that only 12,000 civilians remain, the rest having fled. The entire region has emptied, and daily life has ground to a halt.

The nearby city of Kramatorsk, which held 150,000 inhabitants before the war, is a ghost town. Only a few old people remain; a handful of shops open for a few hours in the daytime to provide food and groceries to the soldiers passing through and the few locals who still remain. A ballistic missile hit a train station there, crowded with refugees, killing 59 people in early April, and wounded more than 100, according to Ukrainian defense officials.

Slovyansk and Kramatorsk are just a few miles apart, and they have become staging areas for the Ukrainian military. They are under constant attack from Russian missiles and rockets: I am awoken throughout the night by resounding booms and constant air raids. One strike takes down the power grid and cellular networks for hours. Multiple strikes in both cities kill civilians, who refuse to leave their homes.
“Do you hear that?” an old man calls to his neighbor, gardening in his yard, as a violent series of explosions echoes through the streets.

“Oh, it’s just thunder,” the gardening man replies. Nearby, a middle-aged woman is pleading with an elderly neighbor to leave. “Where will you go when the Russians get here?”

The Russians have a lot of ground to cover before they can make it as far as Kramatorsk, but the woman has a point.

“The enemy intends to get to the administrative border of Luhansk” with the current offensive, Motuzianyk says. “The enemy intends to take full control of the region.”

But, he adds, “the main tactic remains that of scorched earth.”

“Clearly the Russian leadership demanded changes to Russian tactics to achieve victories, and they are doing what they must to achieve that,” Motuzianyk says. “They are destroying communities and wiping us off the Earth without regard for civilians.”

At a small compound taken over by the airborne scouts, soldiers relax in the yard, grabbing whatever rest they can between missions. I’m standing beside a portly old soldier with a grandfatherly manner, enjoying the sunshine as cottony poplar seeds float densely through the air around us, lending an atmosphere of surreal tranquility as shells and rockets land in the surrounding hills.

The munitions strike so often that you begin to ignore anything that goes “boom,” and only react to things that go “crack,” indicating the explosive has landed unreasonably close.

Fighting here isn’t a new experience for many of the paratroopers, and they are quick to remind me that for them the war began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and sent its soldiers into Donbas to support pro-Russian separatists. Most Ukrainians remain bitter about the relatively weak Western response to those actions, and it’s why they fear the West will once again buckle to Putin’s aggression.

Ukrainians from all walks of life have told me how concerned they are about a repeat of 2014, with the international community acceding to the Russian seizure of their land — despite the blood they are spilling to defend it.

“These guys shouldn’t have had to fight for eight years,” the old soldier grimaces in dismay as he watches the young paratroopers. “They should be at home making babies. But here we are, stuck in this shit.”",c9dafccfaa4685348c698baa8a084b192d5dd9eb,True,False,,,,,0,1655069480,,0,{},ic4s92t,True,t3_vavxyb,False,True,t1_ic4s0eh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vavxyb/theyre_wiping_us_from_earth_evading_russian/ic4s92t/,1655069492,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655040680.0,

We fly through the intersection ahead of the Akatsiya, and its crew doesn’t spare us a glance. They’re intent on their own survival, and making the cover of the tree line.

My concern is not abstract.

In the same area only days later, a team of journalists from The Washington Post is nearly killed when visiting a Ukrainian unit, artillery shells falling just yards from where they are standing. That they survive is pure luck.

Days before that, a French journalist is killed in an artillery strike while filming the evacuation of civilians fleeing the fighting in Severodonetsk, the focal point of the Russian assault.

It isn’t necessarily that one can make all of the right choices and thereby stay safe on a battlefield. Sometimes luck works against you when artillery shells are falling. But it is worse to be caught in some places than others.

He talks in sweeping generalizations as if NATO is one single united hegemon, when it is actually a loose alliance of willing states entered into a defense pact with one another. 

To him the agency of Russia is paramount in its surrounding neighborhood simply by its existence as a large country with a large military.

But what he misses is that every small nation in between the US sphere and the Russian sphere have a sovereign choice. Do they choose the country that wants to invade and oppress them? Or do they choose the country that is happy to leave you alone as long as you participate in their global capitalistic system? 

Fact: USA has never invaded a NATO ally. USSR, the predecessor state to Russian Federation, has many times rolled tanks into Iron Curtain nations to force their will.

Clearly the nations of Europe have chosen the American system, and therefore NATO.

Russia can think it has a 'right' to these nations, but it has done nothing to deserve this entitlement.

&gt;A trip to the front lines reveal Putin’s ’scorched earth‘ strategy and the Ukrainian troops trying to hold on
By Mac William Bishop -------&gt;

&gt;NEAR LYMAN, Ukraine — Crossing the final checkpoint into a battle zone feels like a consecration.

The Ukrainian soldiers manning the last friendly post have a singular focus and intensity that’s lacking behind the lines. They wave us through solemnly, without smiles or chatter. We coast through the invisible barrier separating the “front” from the “rear,” then floor the gas and accelerate forward.

I’m in eastern Ukraine in late May, in a region called Donbas, where the war has become a whirlwind of carnage that is claiming the lives of as many as 100 Ukrainian soldiers a day. The casualties on the Russian side are almost certainly even higher, according to Ukrainian defense officials. I’ve heard conflicting reports about what is happening here, about whether the Ukrainian military is collapsing or the Russians are succeeding in breaking through the defender’s lines, cutting off thousands of soldiers. But it’s clear that Russia is inching forward, each day bringing it closer to its goal of annexing the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk and cementing the region under Moscow’s rule.

Ukraine won’t stop fighting. But it is sacrificing thousands of its finest soldiers and still losing ground. It cannot win the war without game-changing foreign-military assistance: American heavy artillery, Danish anti-ship missiles, German air-defense systems — these are slowly making their way to the battlefield. But can the Ukrainian military hold out long enough for any of it to make a difference?

To truly understand what is going on — to get a sense of morale and see how the soldiers are holding up under Russian assault, I must descend into the inferno, and I need a guide. A Ukrainian paratrooper will lead the way.

I’ve called in favors with the commander of a reconnaissance company in an air-assault brigade, and he links me up with an officer whose elite scout unit is operating near intense fighting outside a town called Lyman, a senior lieutenant who goes by the nom de guerre “Mace.”

Mace is soft-spoken and cordial, lean and fit as an endurance athlete. His face is that of a young man, but the salt-and-pepper hair hidden beneath his field hat and his calm self-possession amid chaos reveal he is a seasoned veteran who saw his share of combat before the current invasion. He takes me to the front in a Škoda station wagon, roaring down country back roads at 100-plus miles an hour, blasting techno as the foliage whips past in a blur.

Mace knows that speed counts here, and he weaves in and out of the anti-tank barricades that are strewn along the roads, gunning the engine as soon as we clear the concrete blocks and berms of dirt. I’m glad he knows which roads are mined. As we careen down a hill toward a crossroads surrounded by a scattering of farmhouses, I see a Ukrainian Akatsiya self-propelled artillery gun dashing toward the T-intersection ahead of us. It looks like we will get there at the same time. I point out the vehicle to Mace wordlessly, and I’m gratified to hear the engine revving instantly.

We are of the same mind. The Akatsiya, alone and moving in the open, is a prime target for the Russians. Likely it’s been “shooting-and-scooting”: If they want to survive, the gun crew has to strike a balance between staying in position long enough to provide effective fire support to friendly ground forces, without lingering so long they get discovered by Russian drones.

The Russians are ceaselessly hunting Ukrainian heavy weapons, and their rockets, artillery, and missiles can strike anywhere here, at any time. The fields beside us are pockmarked with blast impacts, and the tails of dozens of dud rockets stick out of the earth as if planted by some mad farmer.",7d8d48ea2b4c646886bd9d6f41b841affc53ebbc,True,False,,,,,0,1655069329,,0,{},ic4rxt7,True,t3_vavxyb,False,True,t3_vavxyb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vavxyb/theyre_wiping_us_from_earth_evading_russian/ic4rxt7/,1655069348,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655040529.0,

In the past, I had, in layman’s terms, a ranking system for the worlds best intelligence agencies, and through my relatively extensive research, had the US placed around 5th-3rd depending… but the intelligence that has been released to the public from this conflict has changed my perspective here and I have an entirely new found respect for the US intelligence agencies. Previously I had isreal, Russia, and the UK ahead of the US. But now I think the US May be top tier considering the amount of detail they knew about what was going to happen in Ukraine. 

With regards to the front lines.. very interesting what you are saying above. I have been somewhat of a nerd when it comes to warfare history, with my own set of (self proclaimed) expertise being on the eastern front in WW2. But something that I have never been able to fully grasp is what the front like actually looked like. Meaning, was it a continuous line of defenses on either side like in WW1 with defense emplacements? Or was it more like what you describe above for the front line in the east of Ukraine. 

Here is something that I hope is in the works, but this is just speculation and probably hopefulness, but also based on some strategic principles… I hope that Ukraine is in a controlled retreat mode, conducting a fighting retreat while inflicting as much pain and casualties as possible on the Russians while hopefully sparing their own resources. I am hopeful that this is being done in effort to bleed the Russians out, and that by the end of summer, they will have been able to put together enough forces to conduct a massive counter offensive somewhere along the line. It seems like the south is where they would probably find the most success.

He says he has no need of billions of dollars for himself, or for his children, or for any purpose other than hastening the conversion to electric cars, establishing a city on Mars, and his other projects, which he thinks are for the benefit of humanity.

When asked about philanthropy, he mentioned his contributions to medical research and education, which total over $100 million, but he also said that building electric cars, while profitable, is also essentially a humanitarian effort, since it reduces pollution and global warming. Most of his other projects fall into the same category: profitable, but humanitarian in their results.

He also said he intends to give away most of his wealth at the end of his life, much as Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are doing. For now he wants to keep control, since he is convinced that he can do more good with the wealth, than the government or a foundation.

That is what he says, pretty much. You can decide if you believe him.

To answer your other question, am very new to Reddit. I have created several accounts in the past but never ended up doing anything with them. I suppose that the Ukraine conflict was the first topic that actually mattered enough to me to engage some. 
I did say it means nothing to me, but what I mean by stating that is that I try not to let replies bother me, even if they are attacking in nature. I have family that lives in Germany, Hungary, and the UK; as well as some distant relatives in Denmark, and I think even some in Russia. Point being, I do have family members who lived through WW2 (only a few are still around now) and the only reason I was born in the US is because my mom was forcibly removed from her home in Hungary in the 1956 soviet “intervention”. Not that I am proud of this next part, but I also have family in Germany who fought in the war for Germany. I don’t at all support what they were fighting for, but I have an unfortunate hatred of Russia for what they did to my family in 1945 and beyond. 

All this I say to say that I do care about what is happening over there. But I don’t want to be fed lies or some sort of western propaganda.

After that initial attack was snubbed and stalled, it wasn't unreasonable to assume they might fall back to that plan, by trying to occupy eastern territories.

That's because both approaches carried a chance of success. What they are doing now, and their supposed objective of somehow expanding Russia by military aggression... Somehow holding those territories... And through some mental gymnastics seeing themselves better off afterward - that's obviously doomed to fail. It's such a stupid plan, nobody seriously considered that's what they are doing, both because it seemed like underestimating the enemy, and because of all the things Russia might be doing, this isn't particularly dangerous (strategically, obviously it's bad to people getting killed and displaced) or hard to counter.

So if they intend on following through with that plan then great, they will lose pretty badly, and we should be more concerned with what the post-war politics and balance of power will be like - for example, USA not going to war with China. But just because Russia is acting stupid doesn't mean we shouldn't be cautious and not consider some of the more dangerous moves they could make.

All that said, I wouldn't bother too much with what they are saying. Granted those statements have thoroughly undermined any apologists who were working in their favor, it's not like any of those people are going to admit they are wrong and do a 180. And Russia might change their narrative next week and it's not like it's going to tank their credibility any further.",2e0f182d2dba80ee2f0c164c362b14f48a6a00e7,True,False,,,,,0,1655065860,,0,{},ic4klzu,False,t3_vao9kv,False,False,t1_ic3hktq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vao9kv/putin_has_now_made_it_crystal_clear_his_invasion/ic4klzu/,1655065874,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655037060.0,

The tunnel was extremely cheap, built at a cost of $47 million for 1.7 miles. It recently moved 27,000 passengers per day during the SEMA convention.

The tunnel was built in 90 days after groundbreaking, The contract was signed in Many 2019, and the tunnel opened in April 2021.

This is not a stupid project, it is the biggest success story of any transit project in all of America, full stop. There's no other example in the country in decades of anything like this.

I live in San Francisco, so I'll compare with the under-construction Central Subway, which is the same length at 1.7 miles.

This project costs $1.6 billion, about 25x more. Groundbreaking was in 2010, and the contract was signed years before that. It's been nearly fifteen years since the project was launched, but it's not yet open.

You could make similar comparisons with essentially any transit project in America.

Currently, Boring Company is building a 51-station loop in Vegas (separate from the LVCC loop) at no cost to taxpayers, no subsidy of any kind.

When done, the system will deliver trip times just stupidly and incomparably faster than all other transit options, because the trips are point-to-point, taking you directly from your station to your destination station, all in tunnel, with no stops.

Because people hate Elon Musk, they will always latch on to something to demonstrate how something he has done is dumb. Generally, people will compare the capacity of a Boring Company tunnel to something like the New York City Subway, and then laugh about the low capacity of the Tesla Tunnel.

But the New York City Subway is spending $17 billion for an 8.5 mile extension on the Second Avenue Line. If you built this for the LVCC loop, you would be a mad man. It would be the exact wrong choice.

Beyond that, almost no light rail lines in the US get anywhere even remotely close to their total capacity.

An LVCC-style loop could replace almost all of San Francisco's light rail lines. For instance, the 26-station J-Church line has only ~11,000 riders per day. And this is America's second-most-dense city.

Boring Company is not doing anything stupid. They are building the right transit in the right places for a great price, and rapidly delivering progress. It's most all of the other transit projects in America that are utterly bonkers, and that list is a mile long.",8c45b86ef15b2d355e6d0f3b1de09ea53eb5cc2f,True,False,,,,,0,1655062112,,0,{},ic4ckk9,False,t3_vam0ad,False,True,t1_ic41xn8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vam0ad/ukrainian_intelligence_receives_another_batch_of/ic4ckk9/,1655062129,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655033312.0,

1019,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"Andrey, a young car mechanic, was walking through the city of Horlivka in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine with his friend Elena in late March when they were stopped by a military conscription officer who thrust call-up papers into his hands.

Within a week, Andrey, who had no military experience, was on the frontline fighting alongside Russian troops in Moscow’s confrontation with Ukraine. “I don’t know where he is now,” Elena said. “I don’t even know the unit number. He rarely called . . . then there was no longer any contact with him.”

Russia has not introduced mass mobilisation of fighting age men since invading Ukraine on February 24, because it has not officially declared itself at war with its neighbour. But conscription has been in force in Ukraine’s pro-Russia breakaway enclaves, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in the south-eastern Donbas region, since the start of what Moscow calls a “special military operation”. Previously only some men were called for military service, with many exempt.

Russia appears to be relying heavily on conscripts from the breakaway regions in the absence of its own full mobilisation, some analysts say.

In recent weeks, the separatist authorities have reportedly intensified the call-up, with residents saying men with no military experience are regularly plucked from the streets and immediately sent to the front. The escalation, and rising casualty rates, have begun to spark anger even among pro-Russian communities.

Several videos posted online purportedly show the wives of Donetsk and Luhansk conscripts demanding assistance for their husbands and asking why men with no military background are being sent to fight.

“They were not people obliged for military service, so how did they end up there?”, one woman can be heard asking an official who had been intercepted by a group of women in the street. “There wasn’t even a medical check, sick men were taken!” another says.

At least one chat group on the Telegram messaging app shares tips about the location of roving conscription patrols so people can avoid them. Men advise each other to remain at home as much as possible.

A mother living in Donetsk said in an interview that her son had initially avoided conscription because he had previously completed his military service.

“He wasn’t the fighting type,” she said, recalling he would tell her: “Mum, I just can’t kill a person.” But in April, she said, he was picked up off the street, put on a bus and driven to the conscription office, with time only to call his mother and ask her to bring him some personal belongings. “They drove him to the conscription office, changed his clothes, changed his shoes and drove him to the base and then to the fighting,” she said.

He was killed a few weeks later. “I think he probably didn’t kill anyone, in the end,” she added. “He didn’t get the time.”

The centre of the war has shifted to the eastern Donbas since Russia pulled its forces back from northern Ukraine and Kyiv in April to focus on solidifying its occupation of the country’s south-east. Separatist forces have been heavily deployed.

Russia seems to be looking to Donetsk and Luhansk conscripts to make up for some of its own personnel limitations, given it has not mobilised its own population, said Rob Lee, senior fellow at US-based think-tank the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

Russian president Vladimir Putin has portrayed the current stage of the war as a fight for the “liberation” of the Donbas from the “Kyiv regime”. But the high level of casualties among fighters from Luhansk and Donetsk could raise questions about Moscow’s motives, said Lee.

“How much was this about taking care of the Donbas and how much was it, in reality, a case of putting [the breakaway regions] at a lot of risk to achieve a Russian foreign policy goal, at their expense?” he said.

At least two videos have emerged that appear to show separatist military units addressing their leaders and refusing to fight. The videos show apparent commanders blaming their reluctance on the fact many troops are inexperienced conscripts, although the Financial Times was unable to confirm the veracity of the footage.

“More than 90 per cent of the people here have not fought at all . . . it was the first time they had seen a Kalashnikov,” one apparent Donetsk unit leader says.

“For three months we lived like bums with submachine guns, and now they want to throw us back into the meat grinder,” he adds, insisting he and more than 200 other soldiers refused “to go to the slaughter”.

Military briefing: Russia’s barrage hits Ukrainian morale in the Donbas

Russia has sought to minimise the amount of public information about casualties among its own troops in Ukraine. Regional media had previously published details of casualties from their own communities. But last week a Russian court ruled that disclosing any information about the country’s military losses, including names and personal details of soldiers killed in battle, would be considered illegal.

The Russian defence ministry last announced a death toll in late March. At the time the official figure was 1,351, but local activists, who said they had kept an independent tally, maintained the true number was at least two and a half times higher. The UK’s defence ministry puts the current number at up to 20,000.

The number of dead from Donetsk and Luhansk remains unclear. “For me, the fate of these people is the most tragic,” one activist, who asked to remain anonymous, said. “No one remembers them [officially] at all, no one counts them.”

On several Donetsk and Luhansk social media groups, relatives have been driven to search for information about the missing themselves, sharing photos and details of identifying features. Occasionally, handwritten lists are posted with the names of injured soldiers in hospitals.

The posts contain harrowing comments. “He’s dead . . . I served with him,” one man wrote beneath a photo of a missing Donetsk fighter posted by his sister.

“Everybody is getting called up, we’re going to be left without a future,” somebody wrote under the memorial post for a former karate teacher killed last week. “Teachers are dying, sports coaches, tractor drivers,” wrote another. “What will our future look like?

1041,[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"&gt; This vast space has me wondering how the UDF is able to man this lengthy stretch of space with the numbers quoted above.

The answer there has a few different key elements contributing to their ability to do so.  Firstly, going back to the above, we have the situation mentioned earlier about the Russian forces being overarmored and undermanned.  They simply don't have the infantry forces available to hold any ground they take, as armor on its own isn't much help for that role.  Further, the ground itself in this conflict has not been helpful to their armor-heavy forces; recall all the Russian tanks and vehicles stuck in the mud, being abandoned and then captured by the entirely meme-worthy Elite Ukrainian Tractor Brigades^TM .  This had forced the Russians to stick to the roads in a number of areas, dramatically reducing the actual amount of area that any conflicts could take place on, meaning the actual ""front"" was the nation's major roadways, for the most part.  Now, of course, the muddy season is largely past, but with the Russians retreating past the Siverskyi Donets River, this gives the Ukrainians another convenient terrain feature to help narrow down the areas in which fighting can take place in terms of locations where river crossings can occur.  The numerous disastrous attempts by the Russians to cross said river, especially at the same location, are ample enough evidence of both how the Ukrainians are taking advantage of the terrain, and of the Russian leadership's incompetence in attempting the same disastrous crossing again and again and expecting a different result, losing numbers of men and equipment that would constitute complete, full strength BTGs under their ideal circumstances in a full mobilization.  Also, from Google Maps, the P66 highway runs along that river on the Ukrainian side, which would assist in Ukrainian mobility up and down that front as needed, something for which the only analog on the occupied side looks to be more of a frontage road for large swaths of that territory, where it even exists.

Compounding this is the real-time intelligence sharing between US spy agencies and their satellites, and the Ukrainian leadership, giving constant updates on Russian force movements and deployments.  Ukraine doesn't need to hold the whole line, they just have to follow the Russian movements and either react, or hit them where they are weakest.  No sense in deploying men to cover ground that has no Russian presence!  However, again referring back to the Ukrainian irregular forces, the job of sitting in a trench with a rifle and a radio to call in enemy troop activity in an unexpected location can be done by someone with a relatively minimal amount of training, leaving the job of following major troop movements to the trained professional soldiers.",1f94f15c2cda0fcfcc80d36731e65d0e10ad3d76,True,False,,,,,0,1655060782,,0,{},ic49oer,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic3zns6,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic49oer/,1655060800,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655031982.0,

Russian-backed movements in the US that are designed to weaken the American political system include:

* The anti-vax movement. Make Americans sicker.
* Encouraging gun sales and gun violence in the US. (A convicted Russian agent was sleeping with the NRA leadership.)
* Providing stolen oppo research for use against certain presidential and congressional campaigns.
* Using stolen oppo research to blackmail other candidates and holders of congressional (and in the past, presidential) offices. (Fortunately, Joe Biden and Camalla Harris are so squeaky clean that no blackmail against them is possible.)
* Manufacturing fake scandals against those politicians where they have no real blackmail material. (Example: ""Camalla Harris isn't really black."")
* ""Build the Wall."" By whipping up hatred among those who go to ""Build the Wall"" rallies, it blinds people to the fact the US needs the Mexican workers, and the Mexican workers are happy for the jobs. If crossing the border was unfettered, more people would work here for several years and then retire to Mexico, where the cost of living is cheaper, and life is freer (according to Mexicans I have talked to). The Wall campaign is designed to stir up hatred. It has and can have, zero effect on the numbers of guest workers, in the long run.

1) Why we saw what we saw in terms of Russian forces in the early days of the war - no infantry support.

a) Many Russian units depend on conscripts to make up the numbers, and of course the conscripts are in the least technical positions - so in a Russian Battalion Tactical Group, that means primarily the rank-and-file infantry positions, whereas the contractors (professionals) will take the leadership and technical roles.

b) BUT... even just considering contractors, many of the BTGs are understrength. So, an understrength BTG, stripped of its conscripts, goes to Ukraine. An infantry fighting vehicle therefore has 5-6 people in it, of which three stay with the vehicle. So, only 2-3, on average, available to be dismounted infantry, and in some cases, worse than that. So... they have all the armor, all the support vehicles, but few/none of the people who are supposed to actually do the infantry work. Ruh-roh.

c) Yes, there are specialist light infantry units, like the VDV. But specifically the VDV got mauled early in the fighting. The Navy Infantry has done better, but it's also taken it on the chin. So, this has further exacerbated the shortage of infantry.

2) Role of DPR/LNR conscripts - how it explains the disparity between ""Russian"" losses and what the Ukrainians report. And also why ""Russian"" equipment is often totally cr&amp;p - it's DPR/LNR stuff.

a) Full mobilization - up to age 65, no exemptions. Period. People snatched from the streets. Zero training.

b) Evidence even from heavily pro-Russia sources is that these are being used as cannon fodder - extremely high losses. There are reports that they're being used in sacrificial ways - frontal attacks by untrained troops armed with equipment dating to even pre-WWII.

c) Notes that it's strange that Putin is OK with allowing these guys to be under equipped and to die in large numbers, since ostensibly Russia ginned up the DPR/LNR because it was them protecting Russians. But it explains why Ukraine reports the huge number of troops they're facing in the east, and the very high casualties the Ukrainians say they are inflicting upon ""Russian"" troops.

As usual, meticulously argued and with sources provided.

One question I have is why there aren't more reports of DPR/LNR forces surrendering en-masse or even defecting.

No nation should ever try to bother or threat someone else. US is the biggest threat to world peace, they do crazy shit and say ""Why did people react? Now get ready for my wrath"". It's their history, it's been the history of western powers, they always poke their nose in someone else's business, just because they can. Who told them to?

But most of all it will reinforce many of these pre-existing narratives, about how individual states respond to crises, whether they can see a wider interest beyond their short-term concerns, and how much they are prepared to accept hardships for the sake of their values.
&gt;
&gt;Most of all it will confirm a view of Russia as predatory, cynical, and untrustworthy, however unfair this may seem to those who know the best of Russia and its potential to play a constructive role in international affairs. Instead of the cruelties of the Soviet years being allowed to fade from memory they have now been revived in a vivid and painful form and, whatever the peacemakers hope, they will shape attitudes towards Russia for years to come.
&gt;
&gt;When we want to forget embarrassing episodes from the past we talk of the need to draw a line and move on. We seek ‘closure’. But without repentance, closure will not be possible. Can we be confident that the current leadership group in Moscow will abandon its claims on Ukraine or stop it’s instinctive attempts to bully those who refuse to bend to its will? Even assuming we get to the point where they withdraw voluntarily, chastened by a campaign that has gone badly wrong and left the Russian Federation wounded, they are unlikely to apologise.
&gt;
&gt;Because it is a major power, with a large nuclear arsenal, it would be for the best if forms of dialogue and cooperation could be resumed, and Moscow could be convinced that NATO countries are not seeking to pounce upon it and dismember the country. But the past cannot be so easily forgotten. Those who have suffered in the past from Russian behaviour, from the repression of the Soviet years, to the coercion of more recent decades, do not see what has happened over the past few months as aberrant behaviour. They will be urging their allies and partners to keep up their guard. The anger currently directed at Russia, reinforces decades of mistrust. It will be a fact of European affairs for years to come. ​
&gt;
&gt;George Santayana, observed that ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’ But it is precisely because of the regular repetition that it is not forgotten, though it is often recalled with bitterness and without nuance. Marx famously opened The 18th Brumaire by noting how when history repeated itself it did so ‘first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.’ Unfortunately it can come as tragedy the second time as well.",5f95a3a995c519e76c45518562a835759fd41cb5,True,False,,,,,0,1655059529,,0,{},ic46wyc,True,t3_vasffh,False,True,t3_vasffh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vasffh/spirits_of_the_past_the_role_of_history_in_the/ic46wyc/,1655059539,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655030729.0,

Commies didn't like that, that their ideas failed, as they themselves admit, but they didn't wanted to give up, hence they started to evolve and polish and try to refine these backwards ideas, they got into education, and their focus become the abolishment of culture (Antonio Gramsci), then here is your Frankfurt school, Critical Theory, mix some race in there, etc., and primary target group became not working class but students, lower middle class people, here are these subversive Neo Marxists of today.

Also Mearsheimer is fucking wrong and it's not only obvious since Putins admission. NATO was never a threat to Russia because NATO would never want to invade them, and if they did it would be much more realistic and also kinda justified if Russia defended themselves even with nukes. NATO know they shouldn't start something which Russia can end (by ending themselves, too), so they won't attack, and Russia knows this.

However NATO is a threat to Russian expansion, and Putin clearly admitted now he wants to expand and fortify.

Please tell he how Mearsheimer is supposed to be right, and Russia was afraid of a defensive alliance which is only joined by nations on their own decision, and thus was forced to attack in order to protect his country.

When there is also the second explanation around that Russia wants to destroy the Ukrainians and turn Ukraine into a part of Russia and thus Ukraine being part of a strong defensive alliance would make this goal impossible, so Putin was forced to attack before they could join.

It's so much more logical and actually aligns with the facts (NATO is a defensive alliance and has no offensive protocol, countries join NATO voluntarily and are not just annexed, like a certain country practices it, and PUTIN FUCKING SAYING SO), that if you and Mearsheimer keep banging that stupid defense against NATO drum I must assume malicious bias.",ea3b195294824ff912daa1f8bb29677c8c0f1165,True,False,,,,,0,1655058014,,0,{},ic43kwq,False,t3_vao9kv,False,True,t1_ic3v7ie,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vao9kv/putin_has_now_made_it_crystal_clear_his_invasion/ic43kwq/,1655058029,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655029214.0,

Im not sure what the complain here is. There was a schedule for the training of 42 days and now, together with the dutch PZH2000, they will be delivered alongside the trained ukranian crews to Ukraine.


The other heavy weapons, the Gepard SPAA, are again from a privat arms company. Whatever delays happen there arent germanys fault. You dont complain to the german embassy earher if your VW gets delayed do you? You complain to VW.

Every other heavy weapon so far has to be build like the AA rocket system announced rece tly, again a privat arms deal, or upgraded like with the Mars MLR vehicles so it can use all types of ammo.

that I could find. It is from the 10.6.2022 so already two days old.  
And this is what it says:   
Etwas still geworden ist es auch um das (angebliche? tatsächliche?) Vorhaben der spanischen  
Regierung, 40 alte Leopard-2-Kampfpanzer aus deutscher Produktion an die  
Ukraine zu liefern. Diese Meldung einer spanischen Zeitung hatte am  
Pfingstwochenende für große Aufregung gesorgt, denn für diese Lieferung wäre  
eine Zustimmung Berlins nötig. Und würde Berlin zusagen, hätte zum ersten Mal  
ein Nato-Mitglied Kampfpanzer an die Ukraine geliefert.  
Doch wie es  
aus Berliner Regierungskreisen heißt, seien die Spanier seither heftig  
zurückgerudert: Der Plan sei politisch noch nicht final abgestimmt gewesen,  
soll Madrid gestanden haben. War es bloß eine Idee von irgendwem unten in der  
Fachebene? Außerdem hätte die Bundesregierung die Spanier in Telefonaten  
gewarnt, dass dieser Schritt eine Abkehr von der (wenn auch völlig informellen und  
inoffiziellen) Beschlusslage sämtlicher westlichen Bündnispartner wäre, Kiew  
keine Panzer zu liefern. Offensichtlich sei das Vorhaben in Madrid  
durchgesickert, ehe jemand in der spanischen Regierung damit befasst gewesen  
sei, der sich mit dem Thema auskenne, heißt es etwas spöttisch aus der  
Bundesregierung.  
Nach Informationen der Kollegen von »Business Insider«   
soll sich Madrid sogar in Berlin für die Aufregung entschuldigt  
haben. Jetzt sei die Rede höchstens noch von zehn Panzern, und auch diese  
Entscheidung stehe auf der Kippe. Zudem seien die Panzer aus den  
Neunzigerjahren so marode, dass sie erst in vielen Monaten lieferbereit wären.

There has also been some silence about the (alleged? actual?) plan of the Spanish government to deliver 40 old Leopard 2 battle tanks from German production to Ukraine. This report in a Spanish newspaper had caused a great stir over the Whitsun weekend, because Berlin's consent would be necessary for this delivery. And if Berlin were to agree, it would be the first time that a NATO member had delivered battle tanks to Ukraine.

But according to government sources in Berlin, the Spanish have since rowed back sharply: The plan had not yet been finally agreed politically, Madrid is said to have confessed. Was it just an idea from someone down at the technical level? Moreover, the German government had warned the Spaniards in telephone calls that this step would be a departure from the (albeit completely informal and unofficial) decision of all Western allies not to supply Kiev with tanks. Apparently, the plan was leaked to Madrid before anyone in the Spanish government who knew anything about the subject was involved, the German government said somewhat mockingly.

According to the colleagues of ""Business Insider Madrid is even said to have apologised to Berlin for the commotion. Now there is talk of ten tanks at most, and this decision is also on the line. Moreover, the tanks from the nineties are so dilapidated that they will not be ready for delivery for many months.

&amp;#x200B;

It says nothing about it beeing blocked, but that it was the Spanish themself who put a stop to it. 

Frankly it makes me angry that every person in this thread going after Germany because of a single tweet don't bother investing 2 minutes to attempt to verify it. There are a dozen decent translator available nowadays so everyone can if he wants to look it up themself.

The German response is not perfect but attacking an entire country because you are to lazy to invest two minutes and take everything you see in a random tweet as fact is just the sad state of news nowadays.",b51f7295b89693a0af97f2aaffc4e9848145e20b,True,False,,,,,0,1655056965,,0,{},ic41bs1,False,t3_var17q,False,True,t3_var17q,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/var17q/germany_has_blocked_spains_plan_to_send_40/ic41bs1/,1655056980,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655028165.0,

Reporters who say things like this do a huge disservice to the truth. It's implicitly giving credence to the idea that Hitler *really believed* he and Germany were victims. Hitler definitely had many grievances and he convinced the German people of them as a rationale for war, but it's preposterous to think Hitler didn't know what he was doing. He wanted to invade and start small wars, but he needed to convince his population to go along with him, so he claimed to be the victim to the masses. It's beyond shitty reporting to basically say Hitler felt he was the victim - he knew what the fuck he was doing and not calling him out encouraged the West to try to appease him.

On the views regarding Russian military competency, and that is what I was seeking here, was to find an alternative viewpoint from how I view the Russian military. 

Digressing past this now and moving on… I have been sitting here being hyper critical of the support the west has been sending into Ukraine. It is difficult to wrap the mind around just how massive the front line is, I believe it is more than 1,000 miles? When taken into account the salients and pockets that inevitably evolve throughout conflicts. This vast space has me wondering how the UDF is able to man this lengthy stretch of space with the numbers quoted above. I do assume that there has to have been some form of mass mobilization in Ukraine, if not, then I am at loss as to how they have been able to hold their own thus far. Writing from memory, I believe that ukraines reservist force was something close to 1M pre-war. I wonder what percentage of that group has been called to action?

Italy’s Salvini under fire over failed Russia trip  
The Moscow-funded trip was cancelled after widespread criticism in Rome.  
  
Italian right-wing firebrand Matteo Salvini is on the defensive over aborted plans to visit Moscow in late May as part of a trip paid for by the Russian government.  
  
The Russian embassy in Italy said on social media over the weekend that it had purchased Aeroflot tickets for a trip from Istanbul to Moscow for Salvini and his entourage as sanctions against the Russian government over its war on Ukraine made it difficult to make travel bookings from within the EU.  
  
Salvini, once an outspoken admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, claims that he planned to visit Moscow as part of efforts to stop the war. The trip never took place due to widespread criticism from within the Italian government, of which his League party is a part.  
  
“The embassy assisted Matteo Salvini and the people who accompanied him in buying plane tickets they needed in rubles through a Russian travel agency,” Moscow’s embassy in Rome said in a statement. “We don’t see anything illegal in all these actions.”  
  
The embassy said that the costs of the flight tickets had since been refunded.  
  
Salvini has said in recent days that he planned the trip to Moscow “out in the open” and wanted to use the visit to try to stop the war. It has also been reported that Salvini met with Russia’s envoy to Italy shortly after the country’s invasion of Ukraine began.",8c51456d6dbb4d5c1a682ac773e189cf0ada8c68,True,False,,,,,0,1655056088,,0,{},ic3zf41,False,t3_vao859,False,False,t3_vao859,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vao859/italys_salvini_under_fire_over_failed_russia_trip/ic3zf41/,1655056100,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655027288.0,

Also, it gives fuel to the tankies who keep mistaking what he's doing for some sort of communist revival when it just isn't.  What Putin is looking at restoring is the older Tsarist Russian empire the preceded the USSR.

When the USSR ended, Putin was fine with how Russia was transforming from communism to its modern kleptocractic version of capitalism.  He had no problem with THAT.  His anger at Gorbachav was over that new state being JUST Russia alone rather than Russia plus its former empire.  From Putin's bigoted nationalistic view, the USSR didn't have the ""right"" to give away land that had been conquered by Russia long before the USSR even existed.  That was Russia's call, not the fading USSR's call, as Putin saw it.

It's important to remember that when looking at Putin's national expansion views.  He's after some weird ancient Russian Empire, NOT after a revived Soviet Union.  Remember that many of the USSR's member nations had *already been* under Russia's thumb for a few centuries before the USSR was formed.

It's also important to remember that when looking at how Ukrainains are looking at this.  They're not thinking ""Oh No it will be the USSR all over again if we lose"".  They're thinking, ""Oh No it will be the empire of the Tsars all over again if we lose"".

What I said is literally written above for reference. No, I am not upset at all by your response to my comment, I actually really appreciated your other response. I enjoy hearing and learning others’ views and opinions otherwise, what is life even worth? 

No, what my gripe here is that it seems to me, that on the topic of the conflict in Ukraine, at least here on Reddit, it seems that there is a mentality of “you’re either with the Russians, or with the Ukrainians” that is the opine I do take mild offense to. I take offense to that because it appears that voicing any criticism of Ukraine is met with near violent responses, along with baseless accusations of being a fascist or Russian sympathizer. I believe that the most important aspect of critical analysis is that one attempt to remove oneself from their own viewpoint and make attempt at viewing the topic from the opposition. Only then can one truly create a reasonable response and/or argument for or against anything. 

This is what I have witnessed is severely lacking on this “platform” which make no mistake, my criticism is of Reddit itself and the environment it breeds. Essentially a grouping of people who tend to assimilate to whatever the trend of the group leanings are at that time. Differing viewpoints are shunned at best, and lambasted as being ignorant or unintelligent. I’m ranting now as I wish there were a place to truly just have a conversation with others without having to fear reprisal for expressing a viewpoint that differs from the rest of the crowd. 

Back to your last comment though, I am faceless and nameless, and so are you, so none of this really means anything to either of us unless we let it be such.

Don't know what you meant under ""preparing the people"". I don't think that just announcing posible invasion without evacuation would have made a difference. Some people wouldn't even leave from affected ares now, and there were many incidents in the first weeks or month when people just stayed and only started evacuation when there were shells falling nearby or not even after that.

If there was evacuation of border areas, then Russia, while having initiative, would have been able to just stall their invasion for a week or so and with this sow distrust to Ukrainian government. And invade when people started to come back, Ukrainian economy was in shambles and distrust to government was high.

This situation will be studied after for sure and Ukrainians going to issue a assessment to actions made.

My point was more about what they'd be willing to give up. Agreeing to give up Crimea, which is Ukraine's demand, is untenable for a Russian leader, because of how Russians would treat it. Whichever the thing is that's worse, being a pussy or being beaten, for the twisted Russian psyche, giving up Crimea voluntarily would be it.

My point is, the necessary contours of a peace deal Ukraine would agree to are untenable for a Russian leader to accept, who still holds such territory. That's why Ukraine *must* push them out of it.

&gt; I believe that when Russia gets what it wants in the east, it will start negotiations.

It takes two to tango. By your proposal, should Ukraine ""start negotiations"" on Russia's complete surrender now?

&gt; But what if the war of attrition has gone for so long at this point, that Ukraine is completely dependent on weapons deliveries of west?

That's already true as far as artillery ammo is concerned. And artillery has been the prominent feature of the recent history of this conflict.

&gt; Is it Ukrainians decision any more?

As a practical matter, certainly. Ukraine being cut off by the West would have to be simultaneous to be effective. France's hypothetical threat to cut off Ukraine would have to be agreed to by the UK. The single Western country whose unilateral cutoff would be substantial would be the US. Speaking as an American, I encourage Ukraine to publicize such a threat, if made, so we can *burn our politicians to the ground* for trying.

&gt; I'm very afraid that some of the European countries will say ""take the peace, we are not delivering weapons anymore""

Also ""fortunately"", the sort of soft, equivocating, basically-funding-Russia assholes in Europe who are likely to make that demand are only providing a tiny slice of Ukraine's arms. Also, there are obviously countries in Europe who would continue to support even after hypothetically France loses the stomach for it. If I were Poland, for example, I'd be ordering NATO replenishment for ""my"" artillery ammo stocks now, so it's available to provide to Ukraine in such a situation.

In any event, I think right now an absolute majority of Western weapons going to Ukraine are coming from the US, so the question of the effectiveness of a European cutoff is academic.",37ab4b4d8b3b113a6c08c5062921c534e9fc99d5,True,False,,,,,0,1655053784,,0,{},ic3ug3j,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic2dugu,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic3ug3j/,1655053802,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655024984.0,

We are on our third EV now. And we will not go back. Charging is not a problem at all. 

And here are the charge point connected to PlugShare in Ukraine. As you see, it is a bit hard to see Ukraine under all the charge points. https://i.imgur.com/XwDdKmL.jpg

And as others have said, we got enough wall power to charge. I was able to charge 11 kw from my industrial socket in the carport on our first EV (older tesla) (About 2,5 kw from a normal wall socket if needed). But if our house had been on the 400vac based system that is the new normal, I would have been able to do 22 kw. We are now able to charge about 11 kw as we had to install a 230-400 transformer in the garage for the second EV (older Zoe). 

And electricity is easier available then large amounts of petrol or diesel. 
I have ordered 11,5kwp of PV from Tesla, but it does not seem that they are able to deliver, so we are looking at other suppliers.

Translation:  


&gt;As in the past few weeks, only a minority of Germans (22 percent) believe that the war in Ukraine can be won militarily. On the other hand, 73 percent of Germans - across all political camps - believe that the war can ultimately only be ended through negotiations and a diplomatic solution.

This is the root of the problem, and I think it extends up to the chancellor. They are still heavily misinformed and still believe that Russia is that beast from WW2/Cold War, with endless supply of tanks and men. It's again the pacifistic attitude of Germany which is at fault, which so far has prohibited detailed reporting of military aspects, because whenever you talk about such things there is the risk some hardcore pacifists come by and start yelling ""YOU TALK ABOUT THESE WAR THINGS!!! DO YOU LIKE THOSE WAR THINGS??? WAR IS BAD, WE KILLED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN WW2, HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING???""

I don't really watch regular TV any more. But honestly I can't imagine that they would report regularly on Russian failures like Chornobaivka Airport, Severksy Donetsk River Crossing or other things. Tradionally reporting is rather grim and gloomy, so when the Russians attack Severodonetsk it's not about how they got thrown back repeatedly, how they suffered huge losses, how they basically throw everything they have at it and have barely half of it occupied after almost a week. It's all about how the Russians attack there now, artillerly barrages, how long can the Ukrainians hold, etc? 

No wonder people are not sure if this war can be won or if weapon supplies would be good. So far it is not yet common knowledge in Germany how incredibly incompetent the Russian army is, and how well the Ukrainians fight. It's basically still the tone of the first three days of war, basically ""How long until Ukraine falls?"".",df28054c0cf5ec456de5aee1e5782c1fb3005503,True,False,,,,,0,1655050755,,0,{},ic3nv3d,False,t3_vanwpy,False,True,t1_ic3ivx0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vanwpy/german_public_channel_zdf_slams_scholz_for_his/ic3nv3d/,1655050765,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655021955.0,

&gt; ""Nie Wieder!""

&gt; Multiple United States presidents, including Jimmy Carter in 1979, Ronald Reagan in 1984, George H. W. Bush in 1991, Bill Clinton in 1993, and Barack Obama in 2011, have promised that the Holocaust would not happen again, and that action would be forthcoming to stop genocide.[19][9][11] However, genocide occurred during their presidencies: Cambodia in Carter's case, Anfal genocide during Reagan's presidency, Bosnia for Bush and Clinton, Rwanda under Clinton, and Yazidi genocide for Obama.[27][9] Elie Wiesel wrote that if ""never again"" were upheld ""there would be no Cambodia, and no Rwanda and no Darfur and no Bosnia.""[28] Totten argued that the phrase would only recover its gravitas if ""no one but those who are truly serious about preventing another Holocaust"" invoked it.[7]

&gt; [...] The phrase is used commonly in postwar German politics, but it has different meanings. According to one interpretation, because Nazism was a synthesis of preexisting aspects of German political thought and an extreme form of ethnic nationalism, all forms of German nationalism should be rejected. Other politicians argue that the Nazis ""misused"" appeals to patriotism and that a new German identity should be built.[14]

This is more about the USA not living up to their understanding of that phrase. Germans don't use it the same way. Please note: There isn't even a German language version of that wikipedia article.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also on Monday, the same spokesperson said that Berlin was already successfully implementing the “Ringtausch” with the Czech Republic and would deliver 14 Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks and one Leopard tank recovery vehicle to Prague under the swap scheme.

One German official suggested that the row with Warsaw might be linked to the fact that Poland wants better tanks from Germany: While the Leopard 2A4 that the Czech Republic is receiving was built in the late 1980s and has partly been upgraded since, Poland has expressed interest in more modern versions of the tank such as the Leopard 2A6, the official said.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Poland refuses Leopard 2A4s and wants the more modern Leopard 2A6 or Leopard 2A7+, the later one only having around 100 existing in total, all part of the active German Army and all deployed as NATO forces in the Lithuania battle group or NATO Rapid Response Force. Germany literally cant provide tanks to Poland that are a) deployed in NATO Operations or b) not yet produced. All existing german Leopard 2A6s are also currently part of the german army or beeing upgraded/modernized  in factories to Leopard 2A7s and can not be send/sold/donated. Pola ds demand to get Leopard 2A6s would literally mean stripping Germany of half its active tank force immediatly, compromissing all german NATO Commitmeants. This is literally impossible and was without doubt never promised by Germany to Poland. Even if Germany wanted to it literally cant take tanks out of NATO forces to send to Poland because these troops and their weapons are under command of NATO HQ in Bruessel....

The same arms deal that was offered to Poland has been successfully concluded with Czechia before for them sending their T72s to Ukraine. Somehow it worked perfectly with Czechia but Leopard 2A4s arent ""good enough"" for Poland to...replace some cheap soviet T72s?

This is such an obvious attempt by Poland and more accuratly their gouvernmeant party PiS to stire up anti germany sentimeant because their polling numbers arent looking to good and Poland has an election next year. Anti germany sentimeant is literally a core of PiS politics.

1686,[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"&gt;  I’m All for Ukraine winning this, but I despise any and all who depict this as some sort of Incompetent showing by Russia

The thing is, it really *is* an incompetent showing by Russia, and for one foundational reason: Putin declared a ""special military operation"", not **war**.  This means he's limiting himself in what he can bring to bear, by law.  He's got no reserves, and his ability to bring in conscripts is limited to what he can hide.  He's having to beg for mercenary support from Chechnya, and bringing in their own mercenaries from the Wagner Group.  The Russian military absolutely does have the ability to fight a long, drawn-out war, but not a long, drawn-out ""special military operation"".  It was not designed to fight this way, and they have not trained to fight this way; their doctrine assumed full mobilization, not fighting a prolonged conflict at a depleted peacetime strength.  Frankly, their numbers for fighting this fight are too small, the entire Russian ground forces are estimated at only 280,000 allocated to this fight, and that includes all support and logistics personnel...  and Pavel from the BTG's Accounting division isn't exactly a reliable source of infantry combat power.  This is why we are seeing so many of Russia's BMPs with 3 crew and 0 dismounted infantry, they are simply overarmored and undermanned.  This is further compounded by the ratios of conscripts to professional soldiers in their army, as their whole doctrine assumes they will have the numbers of a full mobilization to meet their needs, but with their chronic problems in retaining professionals and their legal inability to bring in conscripts, we're seeing many of those low-skill jobs being taken over by high-skill soldiers.  I mean, even under the best case scenario, Russia's military isn't training Private Conscriptovich on how to operate a $30 million anti-aircraft system, as by the time he learned it inside and out, he'd be just about at the end of his mandated contract of service, and statistically 95% likely not to re-enlist.  They're not going to hand that kind of hardware over to someone living on $30 a month, it would be stripped of important parts within a week, all of those sold off for vodka money.  This gets into the second major reason that this war is a shitshow of Russian incompetence, the huge corruption and graft inherent in their military at all levels, but that's a completely different, and much longer, discussion.

Ukraine, on the other hand, has an army 125,000 strong, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and there were 102,000 national and border guards in addition.  Now, you might look at this and say oh, Russia has more soldiers...  but the problem for Russia in this is that they're fighting on Ukrainian ground, with a population that's helping out their soldiers not only by taking over many of these support and logistics roles, freeing up their soldiers to fight, but also in the many groups of partisans and other irregulars helping by not only chipping away at the enemy in small numbers, but with actual second-line roles.  It doesn't take a great deal of training for a man to sit in a trench with a rifle and watch for movement, but every willing body that does that frees up a trained soldier to flank and go on the offensive.  So, a straight-up comparison of the numbers doesn't give an accurate accounting of the availability of combat personnel given the willingness of the people of Ukraine to assist in this war effort...  and make no mistake, while Russia is fighting a ""special military operation"", Ukraine is fighting a war, and their whole country is in on it.  Analysts’ estimates suggest that since the start of the war the total number of soldiers in their armed forces could have increased to an impressive 500,000...  although this is admittedly a crude estimate, but it shows another problem.  The Ukrainian forces can be replenished, while Russia's forces cannot without actually declaring war.

Now, the Russians have been bolstered a bit by mobilizations from the DPR and LPR, but...  they had a few tens of thousands of actual professional soldiers.  To make up the rest of their numbers, they had to change mobilization criteria to accept people out to 65 years of age, and to get rid of disqualifying factors like...  I dunno, major heart and back problems.  These are the soldiers we are seeing being issued 100+ year old equipment.  Ultimately, they can do some of the jobs the Ukrainian irregulars are doing as I mentioned above, but nowhere near as well, and without any of the motivation, as most of them are being drafted for this.  There are many reports of 50+ year old men going into hiding in the DPR and LPR so as to avoid the draft, so it can be safely said that these forces would likely break and run at the first opportunity...  again, not a reliable source of infantry combat power, and not enough to bolster the Russian forces in the areas where they need it most.",f3c12fc1f5836524ad5abdf61ac4446b4bc194e9,True,False,,,,,0,1655049455,,0,{},ic3l2j1,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic21z2j,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic3l2j1/,1655049469,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655020655.0,

Has nothing to do with the german gouvernmeant. Its entirely an arms purchase by the ukranians fron a german arms company. The only thing involving the german gouvernmeant was allowing the arms deal, which it did over a months ago. Blaming the gouvernmeant for a privat arms company failing is stupid.

&gt;He refused to backfill Leopard tanks to Poland so they could send T-72s to Ukraine.

He did the exact same thing with Czechiam the difference is that Poland regused Leopard 2A4 tanks that are available, which Czechia got, and wants instead Leopard 2A6s and Leopard 2A7s, the later of which only have 100 existing in the world and are all bound in german NATO commitmeants. Its a false attack by the polish gouverbmeabt to create anti german hate for the bext election and can be disproven as fake by using google for 5 minutes and looking at similar arms deals that worked suprisingly. Poland demands tanks that dont exist or that would violate german NATO obligations. This was never promised by germany as it literally isnt in germanys power. Tanks part of NATO gorces are under NATO command and cant be moved without NATO approval.

&gt;He blocked the transfer of Leopards from Spain. 

Spain never made a request to germany about sending tanks in the first place as both Spain and Germany have acknowledged. Also the spanish arent sending the Leopard 2 tanks because they are in a very bad state  spain tried to sell them to Poland in 2018 and after inspection Poland refused the offer because they were not operationable. Spain made an announcemeant, not a promise, of maybe beeing able to deliver Leopard 2s bbut after checking their state of repair corrected it to saying they could only get 10 combat ready at some point. Germany has literally nothing to do with this and since the war started Germany has not blocked a single arms delivery to ukraine by NATO countries.

&gt;Despite being the largest economy in Europe, Germany is #3 in European aid to Ukraine, behind UK and Poland and barely ahead of France.

All the money in the world cant make heavy weapons exist from one day to another...
If you dont have reserves or stockpiled ,you cant just wish them into existance. Which is why Germany has given Ukraine 2 billion € directly and more through the EU to buy arms from other countries because the german army has nothing to spare. This german money was used to, among other things, buy weapons worth 700 Million € from Poland for Ukraine.

&gt;In aid as a % of GDP, they aren’t even in the top ten.

Again, weapons that havent been build cant be send no matter how much money you have in your pocket

&gt;Yet Germany remains Russias biggest gas buyer, even increasing their purchase.

Germany has been decreasing all its fossile ressource imports from russia steadily. If you are referring to the tweet by Ukranian Ambassador Melnyk about supposedly higher imports, the statistic didnt mention that the price for gas, coal and oil between 2021 and 2022 has drastically increased. Also do to covid 2021 was a low intensity year for Oil do to fewer people travelling and more working from home. Saying germany increased imports is insulting and absolutely wrong. The imports have beeb reduced, the price of the imports has increased because the fossile fuel prices drastically increased globally within the last year. And of course it needs the most gas in the EU, it has by far the biggest population and is a major chemical industry hub which uses gas as a base product.



&gt; They have taken no steps to build infrastructure to use alternative sources, such as building a LNG terminal for ships to unload at, as Netherlands is doing

2 LNG terminals are currently beeing build. Gas deals with Qatar have been made for liquid gas sales to germany. Renewables to replace gas consumption have gotten a massive boost. Germany already buys literally every bit of non russian gas available in europe (for years) from Norway,  the UK and the Neatherlands. In the later even forcing the Neatherlands to keep gas production at Groenning going despite earthquakes so germany can buy that gas. Russian share of gas imports to germany is below 40% of total gas imports from around 50% 3 months ago and expected to end in 2024.
Add to that Germany acts as europes gas hub and is exporting more gas to other european countries  then it is importing from Russia. For example Poland is buying russian gas through Germany to fill up their gas storages. The Nearherlands and Denmark do the same.

&gt;In short, Scholz appears to be just kicking the can down the road hoping the war ends before he actually has to take concrete action. That’s weak leadership.

In short, you have not provided a single example of germany breaking its word and have only spread false information on german imports and literal russian propaganda in terms of the spanish Leopard 2s

Europe can push them to reform their government once Putin is gone and help them recover financially.

The funny thing is, the German people truly do want to help, I have no doubt in that. I remember the demonstrations and everything.

But your government does not do enough, and no one can critisize it without being downvoted to hell. Imagine being naive enough to think that Scholz is 100% honest, devoted to Ukraine and doing absolutely everything he can to help.

But everything I say is useless anyway. You Germans love playing the victims and pretending that any critisism directed at you or your goverment is absolutely baseless.

I’d differ in that I refrain from saying anyone is a paid troll, it’s just my opinion that they’re not.

My opinion is it’s a typical Reddit counter jerk and people being a bit lacking in self awareness. They end up basically promoting a “Germany is perfect” narrative, because they dismiss all discussion as disinfo when can we really say no constructive criticism can be made about just Germany only?!!


Fair enough some people have criticised Germany in a rude manner but tbh there’s been a lot of legitimate criticism and there’s much to discuss. But it’s also true people here criticise France, USA etc very bluntly and sometimes uncharitably given USAs enormous contribution. But nobody gets offended and floods every post with USA in the title with “I’m sick of USA bashing” “this is anti USA hatred and disinformation” before anyone has even said anything. With this preemptively closing off the conversation as these are the top comments.

Again it was fairly ridiculous that domestically the weapons transfers are a hot topic in Germany and many Germans are critical of scholz recent actions and it is a legitimate conversation but there are people here calling any nuanced discussion the work of bots.

But still I respect your opinion because truly it’s not possible to know what is organic and inorganic and maybe I’m wrong even about the people complaining about what you say and also even german criticism (to a tiny degree), it’s possible there’s a non zero number of trolls saying a variety of things.

The kids without parents are taken into Russia and put up for adoption. Keep in mind, Russians are told that these poor kids were fleeing Ukraine, perhaps their parents were killed by Ukrainian soldiers.

Its a compelling and heartbreaking story for people who believe the lies.

So what they do, out of the goodness of their heart, is to give the kids a home. They cloth them, feed them, and most will love them. If the child has starts saying how it was the Russians who killed their parents, they will be told they were confused, the state says it was Ukrainians who did it. The adults don't want to believe otherwise.

And of course, the kids are sent to Russian school where they get the Russian version of history. If they want to fit in (which most kids do), they won't rock the boat, they want friends, so they just accept or pretend to accept what they are told.

Some of course will grow up to be good little Russians. Some will grow up and retain a hatred of what was done to them. Some will definitely be ""problem"" children, and quite possibly returned to the state and god only knows what will happen to them.

It is a humanitarian tragedy and war crime what is happening to the kids, but many should go to decent homes and should be treated well, although that is based on my knowledge of what happened in 2014.

Things are a bit different now, sanctions will bite, and this time around, the numbers are greater, and the authorities are quite possibly not being as careful about which people are taking the children. If so, i fear that many will end up under very bad conditions, perhaps with abusive adoptive parents, or much much worse.",553b8cfd3e72d39706a394c4d6a6569d67b24b15,True,False,,,,,0,1655045031,,0,{},ic3bu0i,False,t3_vamf9n,False,True,t3_vamf9n,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vamf9n/russian_treatment_of_ukrainians_no_better_than/ic3bu0i/,1655045043,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655016231.0,

So, my question is; being aware of the very negative repercussions of a Russian victory, WHY is the US not doing more to prevent this? Why is the White House so hesitant to send a higher number and much more effective weapons to Ukraine? Is the answer FEAR?  
If it is fear, which I am sure that it is, then all of you – Lloyd Austin, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Anthony Blinken – should be fired! If it only were so easy. Fear has no place in the White House. Fear is for women, children and weak guys. The US cannot afford to be led by fearful people. Fear will not stop rogue nations from trampling on international laws and international order. Fear in the WH encourages such behavior. Fear won’t help us one bit.

Issues i see:

1) i have seen reports thats russia struggles to supply the demand of crude oil that for example india would Like to buy. So there seems to be not a shortage of demand for russian fossils. Granted, russia won't get the same top notch prizes they get from Europe, but they seem to be able to evade the sanctions to a certain degree at least

2) a Major Factor that has come up in the Last 2 months (and in Last few days even more) is the fatigue of Western interest. Western politician said it 2 months ago, that the Public cant lose interest, so the Support of ukraine can be kept. The issue i See Here is, that the war is stalling (so there are less ""News"" every day) and people become bored of the topic. This is pretty much Common and everyone Here should help to keep his Peer interested in the topic 

3) i dont know how effective russian Propaganda is inside russia. Is it able to rally the citizens? Is russia losing its citizens Goodwill? Thats a Major factor on how long russia can sustain the attack.

Hope all those fears will be proven wrong in the near future, but for now, i wouldnt per se say that time is in ukraines favour.

Obviously If/when more high tech Western arms arrive, the morale for Ukraine keeps been very high, the West keeping the ukrainian economy breathing etc those are Major factors for Ukraine.

So between the first shipment of 5k helmets on 25.02 and the end of the first 30 days an additional 18k helmets were sent.

&gt;No helmets were delivered in the first month after the first 5k were announced. This is the fact.

If thats such a fact im sure you can provide many sources that state that.

could happen if the second delivery was announced one month later after   
the first one was already sent?

There is no ""second"" delivery of 23k helmets. We only know how many helmets were delivered over all during the first month (23k).

&gt; Vladimir Putin is looking to starve the world as he intensifies his war against Ukraine, it has been claimed.

&gt; Timothy Snyder, Levin Professor of History at Yale, has written extensively on Ukraine and has predicted Putin is &amp;quot;Preparing to starve much of the developing world as the next stage in his war in Europe&amp;quot;.

&gt; Professor Snyder said both Stalin and Hitler looked to control Ukrainian grain supply and that the Second World War was &amp;quot;Fought for Ukraine and in considerable measure in Ukraine, between dictators who wanted to control food supplies&amp;quot;.

Even if Putin likes his May 9th parades and so on, he had nowhere near the worship of the military and armed conflict that Hitler had. Hitler wanted war. He wanted glorious military victories. Even if he publicly pretended to not want war and was forced to by outside actors, Hitler was a total warmonger. He was outright annoyed with the Munich Treaty, giving him what he wanted without a fight. It was never a matter of _if_ but _when_ Hitler would start a war. 

War is _not_ and end-in-itself for Putin. Restoring Russian influence and power is. Putin would've been quite happy if the West had decided, Munich-style, to 'give' Ukraine to Putin (an unthinkable thing for most of today's leaders but not Putin, who's stuck in the old imperialist mindset). It's basically what he's been demanding for years. He didn't want a war for its own sake, he wanted Ukraine. If he could change the regime to a friendly one, take some territory and force them into the Union Treaty as Belarus is, he'd probably be happy.  Clearly, he didn't even expect to have to fight a war, although (however poorly) prepared to do so. But he'd have rather continued to build up Russia's military strength rather than fight.

Zelenksyy is right to say that Ukrainian soldiers continue to show courage and heroism in defying all initial predictions. Many gave the Ukrainians little chance against the supposedly superior strength of the Russian weapon.

The courage of the Ukrainians well supported by Western equipment made all the difference.

2309,[],False,,new-bie,,,[],,,,text,t2_mbx42,False,False,"&gt; All warfare is a battle of attrition. The attrition of enemy morale to the point where they are willing to give up, on a tactical level and then on a strategic level, can be done in a number of ways.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Modern warfare is envisioned as a war of maneuver, for both the Russians and the West. For the West, the idea was always based on air power, well drilled infantry and mobile armoured formations, backed by artillery and good communications and supply lines. Standardization of ammunition between NATO members, even ideas of getting tanks to use all kinds of fuel if normal fuel was in short supply.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If you had to what the point of the West's doctrine was, it was maneuver and logistics, at its core.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Russians pioneered deep battle operations. You smash into an enemy formation and then find where it is weak. You punch through the weakness and drive your armoured formations deep into their supply lines and headquarters, backed by artillery, infantry, missiles and rockets. This way you can form pockets of forces which can then be destroyed by elements coming from the rear. That is a big reason for the emphasis by the West on maneuver warfare and decentralized command as well as good logistics and even being able to use whatever fuel you can find.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Because you would get cut off and then have to quickly move, reposition and make your own decisions, with whatever supplies you had.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Russia attempted deep operations in Ukraine, pressing deep into enemy territory and leaving pockets of resistance behind.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But with the advent of widely available portable anti tank technology, drones, more precise artillery and general lack of immediate manpower means that the strategy did not result in those pockets being reduced, but instead those aggressive armoured columns got picked off by mobile infantry elements and precise standoff artillery coordinated by drones. In normal Soviet Doctrine armoured elements drive forward and are followed by a tremendous rush of reinforcements. It's not a human wave attack, it's more like a river rushing around a boulder, except the boulder is then continuously hit by more and more water as the momentum of the water at the front keeps going. In Ukraine the Russians did not actually have the adequate number of following reinforcements to really make this strategy work, even if they wanted to, because warfare is expensive.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now Russia has switched tactics. Focus on small, local engagements. Be methodical, crush each outpost individually, utilize artillery, trenches, tanks for fire support and as a reserve element. Lead with infantry, drones and artillery. Still do those encirclements, but on a slower scale. Create pockets, but do so while keeping security and not being so aggressive. You avoid losses but also minimize victories. The problem is that the other side is also entrenched and so even if your progress is slow, the other side settles, under bombardment, into trench warfare. They get cut off from their forces, run low on ammo fast and either retreat or get surrounded.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; At Azovstal, the Ukrainians chose to stand and fight and obviously lost, despite fortifications. They simply walked out and surrendered, half the fighters being crippled, injured or just having had enough.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Attrition of an enemy's will is not a simple matter of numbers, there is a huge array of psychological factors. So, right now, Severodonetsk, Popasna breakout and Lysychansk defenders are holding on, but they are under bombardment day and night. At some point you just say that you're not doing this anymore and withdraw
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Armoured columns still exist but they are held back to let the artillery work and do its job, employed locally, as support for other elements until the right time.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Primarily the war is turning into a logistics war rather than a war of manpower. There is a lot of manpower to go around for both sides. The problem is training and equipping that manpower. Soldiers with no bullets will not block artillery shells with their bodies, no matter how much you yell ""Slava Ukraini"".

You see the word Marxism and run with anything that gets conjured up by nationalist, anti-left schooling. Shows to go you what cherry picked narratives do to nomenclature. 

First off, Tankies are subsets of authoritarian leftists. Or maybe they are just all authoritarian leftists..I don't know. They aren't really even leftists because they don't actually believe in the end goals. Tankie not an umbrella term for all leftists. In fact, it might be better to call them pseudo-leftists. Many on the left do. The reason? The end goal of leftism isn't establishing China or the Soviet Union, but abolishing such things as state, class, money, and other such unjust hierarchies. Tankies want overt state control. It's a perversion of leftism. 

Second, they are usually Marxist-Leninists, Stalinists, Maoists, Neo-Maoists, or...ugh...National... Bolshevists... I don't understand how you can name a movement National Bolshevism and rarely get called out for using synonyms for Nazi but okay. 

Tankies are not libertarian leftists. Libertarian leftism is decentralized, usually based on community support, mutual aid, and helping people feel safe and self sufficient and happy without the need of a violent state. Libertarian leftism tends to abhor violence, but understand it's necessity when acting for community defense. I'm rambling. This is a complicated subject that most people won't read anyway.

Tldr: Stop confusing Tankie as a general term for the left. Also, Democrats aren't the left. They are center right just about everywhere else in the world. They are basically an equivalent to Germany's CDU, although the Dems are often more to the right of them. We can call them the left in America simply because they are slightly to the left of the far-right populist theocratic, ethnonationalist fascist party.

&gt;When the USA has Don by far the most to help Ukraine. Meanwhile there’s another piston this sub that just mentions Germany and all th top comments are complaining that it’s “Russian disinformation” and “Russian bots” that Germany is being discussed.

Hitler was an anti smoker as well. Does this suddenly make him a good guy or all his other actions irrelevant?

The US doing something goid for ones doesnt cover up all the fucked up shit they did and that influenced eurooes militarys for decades. Only looking about Ukraine in 2022 when talking about military developemeants in europe the last 20 years would be some serious whataboutism.


&gt;And you’re also denying any German appeasement when Merkel denied that Russia was weaponising gas even though they were deliberately creating scarcity by keeping the gas reserves extremely low. All so that she didn’t have to cancel nord stream 2.

NS2 is cancelled and hasnt been used for anythibg. Russia still invaded. Russia blackmailed germany with a pipeline that was never used? Also the gas thibg is capitalism. In germany the gas production is e tirely privat, not state owned. I agree that was a mistake, but that was the market getting abused by russia, not appeasmeant.

&gt;And even scholz before the invasion did the same and refused to criticise Schroder.

People have been critizising Schröder for 2 decadesbut he hadnt done anything illegal....

&gt;It’s absolutely crazy how you can criticise literally every country in this sub but even rant about the Iraq war, being up Libya etc..

Yes, its called looking at geopolitics the last 20 years that lead eurooe to this shitty situation

&gt;But just seeing every single post no discussion on Germany is allowed you have people just circling the wagons calling any person talking must be part of a conspiracy to promote “anti German hatred”.

When they spread fake news based on only reading a news headline and claming germany collaborates with russia or is a russia puppet, then yes. This war is also a social media war and you are falling for russian propaganda here, sorry

&gt;It’s actually ridiculous at this point. I’ve even seen people criticise Ukrainian officials including The ambassador in favour of defending a “Germany perfect” narrative.

Nobody has said germany is perfect, give me a source on that lol. And if you actually read what the ukranian ambassador says or does then you would understand why he is heavily critizised. Ukraine is in a war and uses propaganda and false depictiobs to get more support just like russia, only that their cause is just. Still doesnt mean you have to take every ukranian statemeant as the undeniable truth and look what they want to achieve with it. Its called critical thinking.

&gt;I’m sorry but I can’t take this criticism seriously because people that are defending Germany so hard from even just being discussed openly like any other country, Poland, uk, USA.. they immediately become hysterical and shut down all discussion with ludicrous claim as soon as Germany is mentioned.

Perhaps if Ukrainian could read a history book dating from more than a 100 years, they would understand why we say it. It’s experience we have as a nation.

If you humiliate your neighbor, he’ll come back 20 years later as a nazi. We have had other experiences at that, 1870 war was also a revenge at destroying the Holy Roman Germanic Empire some decades earlier. US did something similar in Iraq, they humiliated the sunnis, the sunnis came back with ISIS.

The smartest thing that Ukraine can do is eliminate Putin and friend with a liberalized Russia. But if Russians are humiliated, they will rebuild their nation for a revenge. And there will be even more blood down the road. And this time they will be ready.

So no, this statement from Ukrainian is not smart. It divides their allies, and target specifically the country that is helping them a lot on a military standpoint (the caesars are tremendously helping, and they have arrived unlike the US aid), on a humanitarian one, on a legal one (we have sent investigators to retrieve proof of war crimes), and on an economic one.

Every post that concerns Germany seems to have all the top comments complain of “anti German bashing” and “hatred” and “Russian disinfo a against Germany”.

I think some people need to wind their neck in a bit. 

There’s been legitimate domestic criticism about delays to German heavy weapons and this has been covered rationally in other posts.

The whole helmet issue is stupid and over blown and I’m not sure where the criticism has come from but Ukraine does have logistical issues on their side, actually dispersing equipment is not always done hands on my the government, it’s often volunteer organisations.

Remember the real victims are Ukraine who are having Ukraine who have had thousands murdered, raped and even kidnapped to Russia.

You are definitely right that just because Ukraine is on the defensive doesn't mean its necessarily going to win.  You are also right that are many examples of battles where the attacker suffered fewer casualties then the defender.  The defense is inherently stronger, but a well executed and supported attack can defeat it.   

With regard to Ukraine, the Russians are basically using an attrition strategy.  They are simply wearing them down with artillery, infantry and tank attacks.  It's effective, but its hard to say how many casualties each side is taking.  In a way, what's going on reminds me a little of the battles of Verdun and the Somme in 1916.  It's not a close comparison, but there are similarities in that both were grinding battles of attrition.  In a larger sense, this war reminds of the WW1 Western Front.  Again not a close comparison, but similar in the sense that both wars have turned into long term battles of attrition.  If we don't give Ukraine more weapons, then it's likely the Russians will simply wear them down and eventually win.",05bc69eb60e19a5a23bd7a66b326889a1602a81c,True,False,,,,,0,1655037745,,0,{},ic2ylju,False,t3_v9uwdn,False,True,t1_ic2l4jj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9uwdn/ukraines_high_casualty_rate_could_bring_war_to/ic2ylju/,1655037758,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655008945.0,

But I really don’t agree with this whole helmets controversy.

I’m pretty sure we’ve already heard confirmation they’ve received some including an image of a soldier whose life was saved by such a helmet from Germany.

Arestovich I support him and think he’s a good man but he is also putting the interests of his country first even if it means playing into certain narratives.

I think he does this well like for example his taunting / coyness after the helicopter raid in Russia by the border.

But for example with the severodonetsk battles early on he said “the invaders have fallen into a trap and they’re now dying like flies” I do accept that there is some strategy involved but the battle has been seriously hard on the Ukrainian forces in terms of losses even if the Russians are experiencing a lot of casualties it’s not so simple as some fantasy battle where the good guys pull off a masterful secret strategy and prevail.

Again I support him but it’s important to remember he’s fighting an information war that is helping ensure ukraines existence.

The helmet issue is meaningless I think as Germany is making moves to finally come through with the howitzers and from there I’m sure more useful equipment will follow..",95420cedead94beeeae8a8cf5ad057563c0e3967,True,False,,,,,0,1655037091,,0,{},ic2xjy2,False,t3_vaic6h,False,True,t1_ic2r8fb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vaic6h/ambassador_ukraine_might_receive_first_howitzers/ic2xjy2/,1655037106,1,True,False,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655008291.0,

Hasan said Russia would not invade repeatedly because he said it was a suicide mission for everyone involved. And he wasn’t necessarily wrong about that, it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that all these things are true:

1.	The Russian people have zero will to put an end to this.
2.	The Ukrainian military is going to have an extremely tough, if not an impossible, battle to retake Mariupol. Which is really what they need, but it’s also what Russia really needs as well.
3.	Russia is going to have Europe over a barrel when winter comes.
4.	Ukraine is going to take decades to rebuild just to where they were, if they ever get back to where they were.
5.	Russia is also going to be in a world of hurt, which unfortunately makes it more likely for them to lash out like a cornered animal.

Hasan’s big point before the invasion is that it would be a clusterfuck of such enormous proportions that even Russia would not undertake it.

If world war II was shown day by day you'd think it was an attritional pointless war on the eastern front with the Soviets having no long term plan.  They would have decried Stalingrad as a pointless battle (took what 6-8) months start to finish for the hard months before the counter offensive.  It seems a lot of the modern experts and historians have been spoiled by lightning fast US successes.  

If you look at even this conflict.  The Ukranians successfully forced withdrawals from 3 of the 5 initial fronts forcing heavy losses each time.  Essentially the Battle of Kyiv, Battle of Sumy, and Battle of Kharkiv were all resolved quickly, historically speaking.  They've already begun the Battle to retake Kherson.  They are taking heavy losses and losing ground slowly in Donbas and Lukhansk.  

Russia doesn't have a huge reserve unless they mobilize and their morale is abysmal.  Ukraine doesn't have the equipment to capitalize on their morale advantage.  If you look at larger scale wars there's plenty of stretches where not a lot of big events are happening but plenty of men are fighting and dying.  They're either holding, waiting for a gathering of troops for a counter or they're part of the end phase of an offensive where they're getting ground down and slowing down.  The point where an attacking force's offensive is exhausted is where you see the big sudden swings if the other side can capitalize.  Think what the Soviets did at Kursk,Americans in early Korean War to the North Koreans, or the Chinese to the Americans in Korea.  

That being said I don't think anyone knows the actual situation on the ground.  We get daily snapshots that the experts use to make broad sweeping claims.  If the Ukranians can't get the equipment to mount a counterattack at the right moment, then the east will be ugly.  If the Russians can't get the manpower and equipment running, they can't really capitalize on their artillery superiority in the east.  Just like the Ukranians used Mariupol to freeze up a large chunk of the Russian military to win Kharkiv, it seems that they're doing the same with the east to retake Kherson.  They seem to have the manpower to fight multiple large-scale battles at once.

Not france, but rather ""the west"" as a whole. 

&gt;Dont u remember that western nations could have stop Hitler but decided that giving part of Czech is not a big deal and would allow for peaceful resolution of the conflict?

You mean buying time for the war industry to be build up? Yeah I remember that. Because no, western nations were not in a position to stop germany at that point. That's the whole reason why hitler ended up invading russia/soviet union when he did. Because every day he'd wait they were getting stronger. But the same thing could be said for all of the allied nations. 

&gt; Russia is literally going full genocide, cities are destroyed. People are mass executed. Ukrainians said that they won't give up.

I'm not denying that. 

&gt; What gives a French leader( who may I remind you Did not wait to become the Head of negotiations....) a right to insult Ukrainian people like this? That their life and land doesn't matter?

What insult? The fact that he said that ""ukraine should give up some land to appease russia"" bs? **Can you actually find for me where he said that?** Like can you look up the actual quote for me please?

Hint: you can't. Because he didn't actually say that. That's my whole point numbnut. People are taking quotes out of context and just throwing shit for the sake of throwing shit. With all the things we can rightfully complain about (scholz' constant lies come to mind here). People seem to have collectively decided to focus on one quote that was completely taken out of context. And the whole ""ukraine should give putin some land so putin can save face"" was never actually said. 

That's my whole point. 

&gt;Macroon is Western link to Putin and he keeps failing to deliver anything. That doesn't mean France and its government is doing bad...but remind how many diplomatic successes can we put on leading peaceful negotiator, Macroon?

**Then why did Zelensky ask macron to be the negotiator here? Because putin refuses to talk to Zelensky directly.**

Everyone knows putin can't be reasoned with anymore. So does macron. But that doesn't mean we should completely cut ties. That just increases the chance of escalation. While keeping the communications open means we can easier keep track of an otherwise secluded leader. **It also helps him believe there's still a way out of it. Which again decreases the chance of escaltion (which is also what was being said in macrons actual quote mind you).**

&gt;Who seemed to care more about how to appease to Russia so western world can continue making money. Somehow piles of bodies of Ukrainian people are not important because.... Putin needs to get something out of it otherwise Western economies are getting hit.

I'm not even sure how to reply to this. Have you already forgotten what the UA looked like in 2014? You know..... before western nations started arming them. Have you seen footage of the initial response to the insurrectionists? **Yes we can say a lot of stuff about companies like thales trying their hardest to work around the sanctions** (and we should)**.** **But then fucking say** ***that*****. Instead of twisting marcons words to the point where he's apparently telling ukraine to just roll over for putin. Even though he never said such a thing.** 

If you have a ton of good arguments, but decide to only use personal attacks you're almost guaranteed to not only not get anywhere. But actually *lose* support.

2619,[],False,,Astalano,,,[],,,,text,t2_ccdj6,False,False,"All warfare is a battle of attrition. The attrition of enemy morale to the point where they are willing to give up, on a tactical level and then on a strategic level, can be done in a number of ways. 

Modern warfare is envisioned as a war of maneuver, for both the Russians and the West. For the West, the idea was always based on air power, well drilled infantry and mobile armoured formations, backed by artillery and good communications and supply lines. Standardization of ammunition between NATO members, even ideas of getting tanks to use all kinds of fuel if normal fuel was in short supply. 

If you had to what the point of the West's doctrine was, it was maneuver and logistics, at its core. 

The Russians pioneered deep battle operations. You smash into an enemy formation and then find where it is weak. You punch through the weakness and drive your armoured formations deep into their supply lines and headquarters, backed by artillery, infantry, missiles and rockets. This way you can form pockets of forces which can then be destroyed by elements coming from the rear. That is a big reason for the emphasis by the West on maneuver warfare and decentralized command as well as good logistics and even being able to use whatever fuel you can find.

Because you would get cut off and then have to quickly move, reposition and make your own decisions, with whatever supplies you had. 

Russia attempted deep operations in Ukraine, pressing deep into enemy territory and leaving pockets of resistance behind. 

But with the advent of widely available portable anti tank technology, drones, more precise artillery and general lack of manpower means that the strategy did not result in those pockets being reduced, but instead those aggressive armoured columns got picked off by mobile infantry elements and precise standoff artillery coordinated by drones. 

**Now** Russia has switched tactics. Focus on small, local engagements. Be methodical, crush each outpost individually, utilize artillery, trenches, tanks for fire support and as a reserve element. Lead with infantry, drones and artillery. Still do those encirclements, but on a slower scale. Create pockets, but do so while keeping security and not being so aggressive. You avoid losses but also minimize victories. The problem is that the other side is also entrenched and so even if your progress is slow, the other side settles, under bombardment, into trench warfare. They get cut off from their forces, run low on ammo fast and either retreat or get surrounded.

At Azovstal, the Ukrainians chose to stand and fight and obviously lost, despite fortifications. They simply walked out and surrendered, half the fighters being crippled, injured or just having had enough. 

Attrition of an enemy's will is not a simple matter of numbers, there is a huge array of psychological factors. So, right now, Severodonetsk, Popasna breakout and Lysychansk defenders are holding on, but they are under bombardment day and night. At some point you just say that you're not doing this anymore and withdraw

Armoured columns still exist but they are held back to let the artillery work and do its job, employed locally, as support for other elements until the right time. 

Primarily the war is turning into a logistics war rather than a war of manpower. There is a lot of manpower to go around for both sides. The problem is training and equipping that manpower. Soldiers with no bullets will not block artillery shells with their bodies, no matter how much you yell ""Slava Ukraini"".",5aed2a45ffc9a09de3a552f0c115887e09a731d0,True,False,,,,,0,1655034626,,0,{},ic2tw3f,False,t3_vajzan,False,True,t3_vajzan,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vajzan/attrition_is_not_a_strategy_it_is_in_fact/ic2tw3f/,1655034642,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655005826.0,

 A commander who resorts to attrition admits his failure to conceive an alternative. He [..] accepts war on the most non-professional terms imaginable. He uses blood in lieu of brains.""
This lesson from the Vietnam war should be heeded by western and Ukraine leaders as well. Right now the war in Ukraine is a blood bath because there is no strategy on both sides and because the West does not supply the Ukraine with weapons in a way that leaves many options.
Claiming to lead a ""war of attrition"" also was generally being used as an excuse for failed offensives or a lack of offensive capability. You also can not win a war by attrition only; you have to perform a successful offensive at some point.
The calculation or ""strategy"" of western leaders right now seems to be to keep both Russia and the Ukraine from winning anytime soon. The Ukraine does neither receive modern aircraft nor battle tanks and no long range missiles or artillery.
Instead we and our leaders watch hundreds Ukrainians and Russians die every day, with no strategy in place how to gain control over events and bring that conflict to an end.
Without one side gaining a significant advantage, the war might go on for many years, and any side can ""win"" such a long lasting war. Russia will not stop until it loses or wins, and Ukraine will not stop until it loses or wins, whatever the definition of losing or winning is.
Also the sanctions do not seem to do anything so far, at least they do not seem to have any significant impact on Russia's capabilities or will to fight, and my guess is they won't - at least not to a degree that matters.
Without the West supplying the Ukraine with the weapons it needs to win, the sanctions are useless and hurt us a lot. Russia's direct costs of war are about 300 Mio. € or $ per day, and the sanctions are estimated to shrink the Russian GDP by 10-20%, 400-800 Mio./day.
Germany alone loses 200 Mio. GDP per day due to higher energy prices, and all NATO-countries together billions every day. I would estimate that the cost of sanctions for the West is about 5-10 times as much as for Russia in absolute terms, and about the same in relative terms.
Our political leaders are wasting a lot of our money and Ukrainian blood with no apparent strategy. Or maybe they have a great strategy and are not sharing it with us, like Russia. Attrition is not a strategy though, but a stupid recipe for a long, expensive blood bath.",2b48107231c75323634661433bd3df955ccfe16f,True,False,,,,,0,1655033258,,0,{},ic2ry88,True,t3_vajzan,False,True,t3_vajzan,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vajzan/attrition_is_not_a_strategy_it_is_in_fact/ic2ry88/,1655033274,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655004458.0,

The deal was that they get the leo2 A4 as a stopgap until the a6 or a7 ones they bought are ready. This was the same deal the Czech government made and is happy with.
Poland told everyone that Germany only wants to give them A4s.
Poland wanted to get new A7 s on top of the ones they ordered

The Greek government said the Ringtausch would work for that but now they want all the vehicles first before delivering.
It seams the trend is that deals are made and then the anti German mood is used to get more out of those deals by trying to pressure Germany with bad headlines.

Spain even apologized to Germany for the issues they caused when newspapers wrote how the whole deal could fail if Scholz doesn't approve the transfer.
There where no 40 tanks ready to be send, the government never expressed the intention openly to do so and Scholz is not the guy who decides everything in Germany.

The Swiss company that makes the Gepard ammo is actually a German company. A few years ago the Swiss government decided that it was illegal to sell any weapon made in Switzerland to a conflict zone.

(And those do not appear to be NATO’s goals.) Similarly, arming Ukraine simply as a pretext to expand NATO would only feed into the Russian narrative.”  
  
This is clearly not what is happening. If the West had wanted Ukrainian markets, it would have been much more open to accepting in, say in the EU. It was also not that present in other aspects. Up to not so long ago, Russia still was Ukraine’s number one trading partner. And, NATO expansion was also never a reason for coming to Ukraine’s defense. Ukraine’s request for NATO membership goes back to 2008 … fourteen years! And, it’s still anyone’s guess if it will ever happen, despite its fantastic performance as a fighter. Finland and Sweden’s recent NATO membership desires came as a surprise to everyone, even to Finland and Sweden. It’s clearly a by-product of mafia aggression.  
  
“…Ukraine could decide to impose greater costs on Russia than would be necessary to re-establish sovereignty because NATO support underwrites the risk associated with a Russian response.”  
  
That’s not going to happen. Ukraine will be happy just to regain its lost territories and to receive just compensation. It is in no position to get any more than that, and it will require a lot of luck to achieve the aforementioned aspects.  
  
“Proxy relationship or not, both NATO and Ukraine must do more than share interests; they must also align them. This is an ongoing challenge, since the costs and benefits of the fighting continually change for each party.”  
  
The costs and benefits are changing; they are getting more expensive, and the benefits are to maintain world order as we’ve known them since the end of WWII. However, the first point to remember is that if the West runs out of steam and gives up, all that had been invested is gone. Gone forever! More, it will raise the price for the near future, for not only mafia land but many other rogue nations will rear their ugly heads and conduct more such aggression to get what mafia land has gotten. This is a Pandora’s Box best left unopened!

&gt; KYIV, June 12 - Russian forces fired cruise missiles to destroy a large depot containing U.S. and European weapons in western Ukraine&amp;#039;s Ternopil region, Interfax reported on Sunday, as street fighting raged in the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk.

&gt; Ukrainian leaders have renewed pleas to Western countries in recent days to speed up deliveries of heavy weapons as Russian forces pound the east of the country with artillery.

&gt; The Interfax report on Sunday said Russian forces had used Kalibr cruise missiles to attack the large depot.

Dont u remember that western nations could have stop Hitler but decided that giving part of Czech is not a big deal and would allow for peaceful resolution of the conflict? 

Russia is literally going full genocide, cities are destroyed. People are mass executed. Ukrainians said that they won't give up. What gives a French leader who may I remind you Did not wait to become the Head of negotiations... And fucked it up royalty.

Macroon is Western link to Putin and he keeps failing to deliver anything.

He also said that we should not push russia (note it says ""russia"" not ""putin"") to the point where they feel the only option is to either use nukes or to roll over to China.

Now all of these seem like very sensible points to me. But it was less than 24 hours before this was somehow turned into France saying that Ukraine should just give up some territory to make putin happy. And the amount of people that roll with it shows how many people here just read the headlines and not the actual article.

For all the big talk about the Russian orcs people here sure are quick to forget that russias entire tactic revolves around turning the Western allies against each other and counting on public interest to die down.

2880,[],False,,GirasoleDE,,,[],,,,text,t2_js5a5,False,False,"&gt;The war in eastern Ukraine is getting worse, while negotiations on the country's European future are taking place in the capital Kiev.
&gt;
&gt;EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (63) arrived there on Saturday. She spoke with President Volodymyr Selenskyj (44) about Ukraine's application for EU membership.
&gt;
&gt;The Commission will publish its recommendation on whether to grant Ukraine candidate status in the next few days. It was von der Leyen's second visit to Kiev since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin invaded the neighbouring country.
&gt;
&gt;And what is the Chancellor doing? Olaf Scholz (63, SPD) travelled through the Western Balkans on Friday and Saturday. Because Scholz thinks: All six countries (Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina) belong in the EU. In this way, Scholz wants to prevent Putin from igniting the region and gaining further influence there.
&gt;
&gt;Western Balkans instead of Ukraine? For weeks there has been harsh criticism that Scholz has NOT travelled to Ukraine since the war began 109 days ago.
&gt;
&gt;But now, according to BILD am SONNTAG, there are concrete travel plans from French and Ukrainian government circles: the Chancellor is planning a joint trip with French President Emmanuel Macron (44) and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi (74) before the G7 summit at the end of June.
&gt;
&gt;Paris and Berlin are said to have been negotiating a joint visit to Kiev for some time. According to BamS information, however, Macron only wanted to go after the French parliamentary elections (which take place tomorrow). The third member of the group, the Italian head of government, is said to have been an idea from France.
&gt;
&gt;Scholz, Macron and Draghi want to send a signal of European unity with their trip.
&gt;
&gt;Von der Leyen has so far advocated Ukraine's accession to the EU. Whether Scholz and Macron will also support Kiev in this is open. Macron brought cooperation without membership into play. Scholz does not want to comment before the EU Commission's recommendation.
&gt;
&gt;The visit of Scholz, Macron and Draghi comes at an explosive time: Ukraine is threatening to lose more territory in the east of the country, and the Russian army is advancing in the Donbass. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition there. It remains to be seen whether Germany, France and Italy will deliver more weapons.
&gt;
&gt;Scholz had previously announced that he would only visit Kiev if there was a reason for doing so: ""I will not join a group of people who come in and out for a short photo opportunity. Instead, when I do, it's always for very specific things.""
&gt;
&gt;The whole of Ukraine is now hoping that Scholz, Macron and Draghi will finally bring help - with more weapons and EU membership.
&gt;
&gt;But the weapons issue is not the only thorny one in the upcoming visit: Scholz and Macron, in particular, are criticised for continuing to maintain contact with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. 
&gt;
&gt;In an interview with BILD, Poland's President Andrzej Duda criticised: ""I am amazed at all these talks that are being held with Putin at the moment by Chancellor Scholz and President Macron. These talks achieve nothing. They only have the effect of legitimising someone who is responsible for crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine."" He continued, ""Did anyone talk like this to Adolf Hitler in World War II?""
&gt;
&gt;The forthcoming visit of no less than three European heads of government will certainly be followed closely throughout Europe...
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, in a video address to the Shangri-La Dialogue, a major annual security summit in Singapore, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj said it was ""too late"" to persuade Russia to end its invasion and that it was now up to the world to ""put Russia in its place"". There was no longer a ""grey area"" when it came to supporting either Ukraine or Russia, he said. ""If you are for peace now, then you support Ukraine. If you support this war, then you have to come to an understanding with the Russian Federation. That's all,"" the Interfax agency quotes Selenskyj as saying.

1) they are incredibly expensive to maintain and you need a certain amount of engineering/Tech knowledge

2) the US lost multiple nuclear bombs by accident. *The fucking US* with a Military budget 5 Times over any other Nation on this planet. Like how likely would a nuclear incident be in a 3rd world Nation

3) Can you make sure, that the democratic process in Ukraine will be a success? Like could you guarantee that in 20 years from now, Ukraine is a democratic pillar of the world instead of a corrupt country (i cant, i cant even guarantee that there won't be another President Like trump in the US).

4) the solution is Not more nuclear weaponary, but defensive treaties Like NATO. Defense pacts. Or providing international organisations with some teeth.

*OLHA HLUSHCHENKO – SUNDAY, 12 JUNE 2022, 07:20*  
  
*The Armed Forces of Ukraine have repulsed Russian attacks in several towns and villages on the Bakhmut front in eastern Ukraine. Over the course of the past 24 hours, they have destroyed Russian military equipment and have killed up to 150 Russian occupying troops.*  
  
*Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook, information as of 06:00 on Sunday, 12 June*  
  
*Details: On the Volyn and Polissia fronts, Russian forces have not undertaken active combat operations. The Belarusian Armed Forces are performing combat engineering tasks to reinforce checkpoints and deploy additional electronic warfare equipment in the areas near Belarusian-Ukrainian border (in Belarus).*  
  
*On the Sivershchyna front, Russian forces have intensified the security of the Ukrainian-Russian border in Bryansk and Kursk oblasts (of Russia), where a heightened level of terrorist threat is still in place. Russian forces are firing on Ukrainian Defence Force positions with mortars in border-adjacent areas of Ukraine. In addition, Russian troops have fired on civilian infrastructure in the areas around Rozhkovychi, Hremiach, Luhivka, and Popivka.*  
  
*On the Kharkiv front, the situation remains unchanged. Russian forces are systematically firing on the positions of Ukrainian units in order to pin the Ukrainian troops down. In addition, Russian troops have fired on civilian infrastructure near Virnopillia, Ukrainka, Petrivka, Chepil, and Khrestyshche. Russian aircraft conducted an airstrike near the village of Mospanove.*  
  
*On the Sloviansk front, Russian forces systematically fired with artillery on the towns and villages of Petrivske, Nova Husarivka, Kurulka, and Dolyna. Russian troops are training to gain a foothold in the village of Bohorodychne, where fighting is continuing.*  
  
*We have launched English Twitter! Follow us!*  
  
*Russian troops did not undertake active combat operations on the Lyman front. Russia has intensified its use of artillery – in particular multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) – in the area around Shypylivka and Dronivka. Russian troops are regrouping.*  
  
*On the Sievierodonetsk front, Russian occupation forces are continuing to storm the city of Sievierodonetsk, but have not been successful. Fighting is continuing in the area near Toshkivka.*  
  
*On the Bakhmut front, Russian troops fired on the Ukrainian positions with mortars and barrel and jet artillery in the areas near Komyshuvakha, Hirske, Mykolaivka, Bilohorivka, and Novoluhanske. Russian aircraft conducted an airstrike near Pokrovske.*  
  
*Ukrainian Armed Forces have repulsed a Russian attack near the town of Vrubivka. Russian forces have also attempted to advance on the village of Mykoalivka, but were decisively repulsed and forced to retreat. The Ukrainian defenders have also successfully repelled a Russian attack on Vasylivka. Russian occupation forces have suffered losses and retreated to the positions they previously occupied.*  
  
*On the Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Novopavlivka, and Zaporizhzhia fronts, Russia did not undertake active combat operations. Russian forces shelled civilian infrastructure in Zhelanne, Avdiivka, Karlivka, Vuhledar, and Orikhiv. On some of these fronts, Russia has deployed additional units.*  
  
*On the Pivdennyi Buh front, Russia has taken up a defensive position and continued to fire on Ukrainian troops with artillery, mortars, and MLRS. Russian forces have delivered counter-battery fire in order to neutralise Ukraine’s fire support systems.*  
  
*Russian occupation forces have cynically fired on the towns and villages in Tverdomedovo, Bereznehuvate, Kobzartsi, Kvitneve, and Luch.*  
  
*Over the course of the past 24 hours, Russian forces have lost 10 tanks, 16 armoured combat vehicles, 7 UAVs, over 10 motor vehicles, and up to 150 military personnel.*",759ad647f2c5f6ff87ca37aba888840531346b08,True,False,,,,,0,1655028509,,0,{},ic2megv,True,t3_vaiv6p,False,True,t3_vaiv6p,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vaiv6p/ukrainian_armed_forces_repel_russian_attack_on/ic2megv/,1655028522,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654999709.0,

If you read the article, you would know that the whole point is that Spain **didn't** put in a request: 

""Kein Wunder also, dass es bislang auch noch keinen Antrag bei der   
Bundesregierung gibt, spanische Panzer in die Ukraine zu liefern.""

""No wonder that there is no request from the spanish government to export the tanks.""

&gt;The news caused quite a stir in Berlin over the Whitsun weekend: according to a report in the daily newspaper ""El Pais"", the Spanish government is said to be thinking about sending up to 40 old Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, which it bought from German industry in the 1990s. Politically, this would be extremely delicate, especially for Germany: it would be the first time that a NATO member would send modern tanks to Ukraine. The pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) to finally follow suit would increase dramatically.However, according to information from German government circles obtained by Business Insider, the alleged offer from Madrid has apparently shrunk considerably. In the meantime, it is only a matter of ten tanks at most, according to people familiar with the matter. And even this number is uncertain, since the vehicles are apparently completely dilapidated and will have to be repaired in the next few months. And anyway, the delivery would first have to be agreed upon within the Spanish government. Spanish officials are said to have admitted this and apologised to the German government for the uproar - and the pressure it put on the chancellor.Read alsoPutin warns Chancellor Scholz and French President Macron against heavy arms deliveriesNo wonder, then, that the German government has not yet submitted an application to supply Spanish tanks to Ukraine. According to so-called end-use clauses in arms contracts, the German government must agree to the resale of German military equipment to third countries. These regulations are intended to prevent German war weapons from being used, for example, in civil wars by dictatorships or by child soldiers.Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

I agree with this, for what it's worth, but the bigger problem media-wise **at the moment** is not Germany, but France.  Scholz has a bad habit of not sending weapons, or delaying, when he could send everything Germany has, and that can make a difference on the ground, in the purely **military** campaign, but he does at least show moral support and makes clear he's on the side of the West.

This is the totally opposite approach to France.  The French Army is doing everything it can to send weapons and training and everything that matters, militarily speaking (the Caesars—pretty good howitzers—are just the beginning) but it has a historical habit of being quiet about things (the sssh-keep-it-a-secret brigade, to the point they're called *La Muette*).  Can't fault that, every country has its own military character, and the French have been doing this since Bonaparte.  But **politically** they're a mess, especially Macron, who loudly and publicly kowtows to Russia and Putin every chance he gets.  This damages the war effort hugely.  

It's like there's a huge disconnect between the Pentagon and the President.  That's what France is going through: the French Pentagon wants to help out as much as it can, Macron tacitly allows this to happen (but I can't see him *supporting* it), but as for Macron, he thinks he's De Gaulle and wants to be top dog diplomatically in Europe.

&gt; _""it will be hard to extricate Russia from the Donbas and Crimea where Russian troops have been dug-in since 2014.""_

&gt; _"" it should be clear for how long and at what expense.""_

All of this has the implicit understanding that Russia is a logical actor that will eventually have had enough territory and will have killed enough children. When they have their fill of dead children then we will just discuss with them, give them a little bit of Ukrainian Sudetenland and they will stop.

Russia will only stop temporarily and to regroup. They will negotiate, but will only accept conditions and situations which they see will give them an advantage in their future planned war for more, up to and including Poland, wars that will bring in Canadian soldiers and lead to many more Ukrainian and Canadian dead. 

There will be no better time than now to fight Russsia. From here on in, with more time given to Russia, things only get worse. The nuclear weapons with which they threatened to destroy the entire countries of Ireland and the UK may actually end up existing. The rail lines that Russia needs to take Kiev will be built. Lukashenko will be forced to accept Russan bases and logistics systems on the Ukrainian border. This article in itself is designed to weaken Ukraine and make them vulnerable.

Trump - he set up the the conditions for a power vacuum in Afghanistan and legitimized Taliban power (and US) weakness. As well, Trump struck a very strong isolationist tone despite taking out an Iranian general in Iraq.

Biden - solidified the perception of US weakness when he haphazardly left (to put it mildly) Afghanistan.

Clinton - It could be argued that had the Bucharest Memorandum not been struck Russia would not have invaded a free nuculear Ukraine. However, it could also be argued that Putin would have made doubly sure that his cronies would be in power in Ukraine. So I am going to give Clinton a pass on this one.

China now has the largest navy in the world in terms of number of ships and is launching three aircraft carriers.

As Ukraine show, you don't build these capabilities in a short period of time but if you do build them sufficiently then you can massively increase the cost of an invasion. It's quite likely that China can be persuaded to take a different route from Russia and end in peaceful coexistence and trade. Achieving that will require massive upgrades in Western military.

There is a very big difference between the two. The first would be stupid whilst the second is inevitable at the point that the war starts to turn and is in fact what's more or less ongoing. First a Russian advance, then a period of stalemate, then a gradual wearing down of the Russian army and finally a slow but total destruction of the Russian forces as Ukraine pushes them back but Putin refuses to allow them to retreat. 

Western weapons _are_ being delivered too slowly, however that's a mix of two things. Failure of total commitment from Germany and the like - N.B. total commitment is lots to ask and whilst some criticism is deserved the level of criticism in this forum is vastly over the top. Secondly, simply the time it takes for effective deployment of weapons. 

We have already seen modern weapons being lost and some of those losses looked like lack of efficient use and training. Ukrainian commanders have been complaining about lack of training and both the M109 and the M777 were out in open fields, with at least one being found by a drone where it could have been hidden. Losing the occasional weapon in this way is absolutely fine and right - lots of learning comes with experience - but it must not happen at scale, which means that Ukrainian soldiers need to be coming to the west and getting trained at a much bigger scale than now.",1f98a9c842a209e6f986b3e0d31fff6c5a0d47af,True,False,,,,,0,1655022768,,0,{},ic2g6va,False,t3_vafrbr,False,True,t1_ic2awk4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vafrbr/putin_the_great_and_his_budget_empire_can_only/ic2g6va/,1655022782,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654993968.0,

For Russian culture its ok to be beaten but you can not be pussy. Hence I believe when they are beaten they will try to negotiate peace.

War of attrition is going on. Russia's main goal seems to be the east parts of Ukraine and the land corridor to Crimea. They withdraw troops from Kyiv because they realized they would not make it. The goals for Russians seems to be changing over time and becoming more realistic for their capabilities.

I believe that when Russia gets what it wants in the east, it will start negotiations. Russia will try to keep the east and the land bridge to Crimea. It can even withdraw from Kherson+Kharkiv areas as a sign of ""good will"". Of course Ukraine will not agree to any territory losses. But what if the war of attrition has gone for so long at this point, that Ukraine is completely dependent on weapons deliveries of west? Is it Ukrainians decision any more? I'm very afraid that some of the European countries will say ""take the peace, we are not delivering weapons anymore""

The US has said they aren't doing that. The US is an open society with freedom of speech which means that if they say they won't do it then it's very difficult for them to hide that they are. This means they aren't providing this. The Ukrainians have to do it themselves with drones which is much slower. 

&gt; The first thing they will take out are the antimissile batteries

It's not that easy. You will take out what you find first; artillery or antimissile or simply heavy weapon. The Russians are not stupid and will dig in and hide their most important assets.

&gt; I suspect they come with volunteer mechanics.

Again, this couldn't be hidden and won't be done. There might be a few Americans who came through the normal volunteering system but that's going to be very very rare. 

&gt; My bet is there will be three times that many systems and enough ammo to take out all the command and control and anti-air batteries by the HIMARs.

Let me spell it out: Americans will die by the millions too. You're not safe behind that ocean. Most ICBMs are targeted not at us but at you.

You can see what western training, intelligence and western weapons can do. Even in small numbers they  change the battlefield.

Russia is no match for the combined conventional NATO forces. None. It will be over in a week. 

But in that truth lies the whole problem. Because that fact means it will result in global nuclear war. And even when the Russian nuclear triad is in the same state as it's conventional forces, half of it will still work. And that half will decimate every western, every US city. 

This is no Iraq. This is no Afghanistan. Total war against Russia can and will only result in a global nuclear conflict in which you (and me) will most probably die. Be it during or be it in the aftermath.

There will be no WWWIV. That's the cold hard truth regarding WWWIII.

That's always true, things are always ""more complex"" and blaming a single factor is dangerous, and it's also true that Germany is not an elected dictatorship, both Schroeder(*) and Merkel had to deal with the their respective parliamentarians and so on. OTOH, when you have a reduction from 2100 to 350, the aim is to leave that final 350 fully effective based on cost reductions and, the Chancellor is commander of the army. Yes, I will blame them. 

Imagine Russia had succeeded in just taking Ukraine in a sudden Blitzkreig push as they had planned. Germany's current defensive situation would be totally inadequate. Imagine that Hungary, at that stage, simply invited the Russians in? Not even Poland's preparation would be anywhere near to adequate. The Chancellors had a job to do - to flag up the weakness of the German army and demand action. Instead they made the idiot-savant Trump seem wise. That's an embarrassment.

That was not decided under her leadership, and it had been impossible for her to turn it back.

&gt;Build new ones.

That is even more impossible, not even the industry wanted to build new nuclear power plants.

&gt;Not build nordstreams.

Merkel didn't build nordstreams, she didn't stop Nordstream 2, which was already agreed on and had started before her. Indeed I agree that was an error.

&gt;Not block 2008 nato integration of Ukraine and Georgia.

In the end like half of NATO didn't want Ukraine and Georgia in NATO, a few more, had - with pressure by the US, probably agreed on a MAP, but never finally on the membership. Germany and few others said that loud, but it had not happened anyway. Ukraine at that time was a highly unstable nation, with extreme corruption, and with alternately having ""pro-Russian"" and ""pro-Western"" leaderships, with putting opposition leaders in jail and so on. Do you think a Ukraine under Yanukovych had been a good addition to NATO?

About realpolitik - Merkel never really did that - she did pretty pragmatic politics, and most based on compromise, in particular related to the EU (but that is the German role already by design). What she did back then, with few exceptions, was celebrated by most nations and people, and much of it was indeed all she could do. It seems much to me now, like people are now searching for a scapegoat.

If you are talking about errors after 2014, I see one big one, but somebody weirdly never mentioned - Obama. He stepped back and let Merkel and Hollande deal with Russia and Ukraine. With a political leadership by the US it might have looked different, and other measures might have been possible.",96f9928cd1c25d121096f8f0f904c33fb3a3f0e7,True,False,,,,,0,1655016325,,0,{},ic28w3q,False,t3_va0r5c,False,False,t1_ic0hzmi,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0r5c/merkel_will_enter_history_as_the_neville/ic28w3q/,1655016338,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654987525.0,

""The information about the blockade of the Azot plant is a lie,"" Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists, said on the Telegram messaging app.  
  
""Our forces are holding an industrial zone of Sievierodonetsk and are destroying the Russian army in the town,"" he wrote.  
  
Sievierodonetsk, a small city in the region, has become the focus of Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine and one of the bloodiest flashpoints in a war now into its fourth month.  
  
Ukraine has said some 800 people were hiding in several bomb shelters underneath the Azot plant, including about 200 employees and 600 residents of Sievierodonetsk.  
  
Rodion Miroshnik, a Russian-backed representative of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, said tonight that some civilians had started to leave.  
  
""There are occasional exchanges of fire. ... They (the Ukrainian defenders) may still be holding several hundred civilians hostage,"" he said in an online post.  
  
Reuters was not immediately able to verify his account.  
  
  
Smoke billows from the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk  
Mr Miroshnik had earlier said 300 to 400 Ukrainian fighters were blockaded on the grounds of the plant along with civilians and had tried to negotiate their passage to Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk's twin city.  
  
Earlier, Russian shelling of the Azot plant caused a strong fire today after a leak of tonnes of oil, the regional governor said.  
  
Speaking on national television, Serhiy Gaidai said non-stop fighting was raging in Sievierodonetsk and that Russian forces controlled most of the city but Ukraine controlled the Azot chemical plant.  
  
Ukraine has appealed for swifter deliveries of heavy weapons from the West to turn the tide of the war, saying Russian forces have at least 10 times more artillery pieces than Ukrainian forces.  
  
Yet even when outgunned, Ukraine's army has proved more resilient than expected in early phases of fighting.  
  
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy struck a defiant note today.  
  
""We are definitely going to prevail in this war that Russia has started,"" he told a conference in Singapore via videolink. ""It is on the battlefields in Ukraine that the future rules of this world are being decided.""  
  
  
Ukrainian artillerymen load a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher near Izyum today  
After Russia was forced to scale back its initial more sweeping campaign goals, Moscow has turned to expanding control in the east, where pro-Russian separatists had already held a swathe of territory since 2014.  
  
The eastern region known as the Donbas includes the provinces of Luhansk, where Sievierodonetsk lies, and Donetsk.  
  
Russian strikes knocked out power supplies in Donetsk's two largest Ukrainian-controlled cities - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk - today, regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote on the Telegram app.  
  
Speaking later on national television, he said the move was part of a deliberate strategy to cut off electricity in towns in Donetsk that remain in Ukrainian hands.  
  
""The enemy understands where he is hitting, and for what purpose,"" he said.  
  
The battle for Sievierodonetsk and its destruction recall weeks of bombardment of the southern port city of Mariupol.  
  
It was reduced to ruins before Russian forces took control of the city last month, with the last Ukrainian defenders surrendering from their redoubt in the Azovstal steel plant.  
  
Also today, authorities in the Moscow-occupied city of Kherson in southern Ukraine handed out Russian passports to local residents for the first time, news agencies reported.  
  
Russia's TASS agency says 23 Kherson residents received a Russian passport at a ceremony through a ""simplified procedure"" facilitated by a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May.

&gt;  
&gt;Advocates of this policy may be mistakenly extrapolating from the enthusiasm with which Russians greeted the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and with which many Crimeans greeted it, too.  
  
But that was a very specific case. Crimea had been a part of Russia until 1954 and most Russians genuinely considered it “theirs”. One cannot say the same of Donbas, let alone Abkhazia.  
  
Already there has been some resentment at the £10 billion of subsidies lavished on Crimea, while subsidies to Chechnya were once controversial enough to spark protests with racist overtones against “feeding the Caucasus” that even the now-imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny supported.  
  
Likewise, it is not clear that these regions would welcome the motherland’s embrace. Even in Crimea, there is a new mood of disillusionment, not least because much of the promised investment there was stolen or wasted.  
&gt;  
&gt;In South Ossetia the previous president, Anatoly Bibilov, favoured a referendum on annexation as it would finally unite the area with North Ossetia, a Russian region, but Alan Gagloyev, who defeated him to win election last month, has backed away from the idea.  
  
As for Belarus, although President Alexander Lukashenko is now in effect dependent on Moscow’s support, he would demand a high price for acceding to any such plan, especially as the days when Putin had the muscle to replace him with a more deferential proxy are probably over.  
  
Not so ‘Great’  
&gt;  
&gt;Nonetheless, Putin has form buying an apparent short-term gain at the cost of long-term pain (arguably, annexing Crimea was an example of this). Besides, given the persistence of rumours about his health, these days he may not care so much about the long term.  
  
He clearly has not yet decided on his next move, but his aspirations to follow in the footsteps of those “Greats” Peter and Ivan may yet lure him toward bolder and ultimately more expensive policies that, ultimately, could prove his undoing.

3594,[],False,,zebsdee,,,[],,,,text,t2_9um0yw2,False,False,"&gt;**Annex ‘people’s republics’**  
They advocate the annexation of the two rebel “people’s republics” in Donbas — whose pliant leaders have already advertised their wish to formally join Russia.  
  
Indeed, recent visits by the deputy head of the Russian presidential administration Sergei Kiryenko — Putin’s main political fixer — and Marat Khusnullin, deputy prime minister for regional development, suggest that plans are under way to annex at least the rebel republics formed in 2014 and possibly also Ukrainian territories conquered since the invasion began in February.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tellingly, on Wednesday, Denis Pushilin, head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic”, reshuffled his cabinet and introduced a number of former Russian officials, while the next day his counterpart in the “Luhansk People’s Republic”, Leonid Pasechnik, appointed the former deputy governor of Russia’s Kurgan region as his deputy prime minister.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are those — and the ambitious Kiryenko may be among them — who want to go further.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pound-shop empire**  
They suggest this is a good time to snatch up other Russian-backed regions and advocate a general annexation — framed as acceding to local requests — of the breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia.  
  
Beyond that, they even toy with the idea of either swallowing up Belarus or, less dramatically, building on the existing treaty between Minsk and Moscow to turn the existing “Union State of Russia and Belarus” into something that looks much more real.  
  
Then, the argument goes, this could all be presented to the Russian people as a reversal of the badly-thought-through fragmentation of the Soviet state at the end of 1991, a fixing of artificial and discriminatory boundaries and a national triumph.  
  
Putin could then be painted as a modern-day Ivan the Great, who defeated the Tatars and “gathered the Russian lands” under Moscow at the end of the 15th century. Yet this would be the pound shop equivalent, snapping up the cheap, the desperate, the bankrupt, the available.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Long-term costs**  
Putin’s propagandists would duly spin this as a victory, of course, but this would be one bought at massive further long-term costs.  
  
Internationally, this would be seen as proof of an insatiable imperialism, a determination to restore the tsarist or Soviet empires. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, called Putin’s Peter the Great remark last week “a recipe for years of war”. Even China might be uncomfortable given its formal commitment to the sovereign rights of nations (under which it claims sovereignty over the “province” of Taiwan).  
&gt;  
&gt;Money would have to be found from Russia’s creaking federal budget for lifting up these new acquisitions to demonstrate some material advantage to the locals. Given that Moscow would have to work through existing elites in these areas, most of whom are thuggish gangsters, much of that investment would simply be stolen.  
  
Administratively, it would also put renewed pressure on a state machine that is already struggling. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, is an ardent advocate of modern “techno-authoritarianism” with unified databases and standardised systems. The complications of mass annexations would undermine his vision of future governance.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are also security challenges: the armed forces of these regions, many of which are really militias, would not necessarily be enthused about going to fight in Ukraine. If anything, Russian military and Federal Security Service (FSB) resources might have to be diverted to them in order to maintain Moscow’s writ on these new possessions.",a6fefec722f24a93438bbc51c5ba6c836be8b29c,True,False,,,,,0,1655014703,,0,{},ic26x64,True,t3_vafrbr,False,True,t1_ic26ro3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vafrbr/putin_the_great_and_his_budget_empire_can_only/ic26x64/,1655014720,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654985903.0,

I'm Lithuanian, my country for example is completely off Russian well basically everything, BUT its not because we had some better morals than Germany or France, we simply had a lot of history with Russia and knew for a long time it cant be trusted, so we prepared, we built electric interconnects with other countries, we built an LNG terminal and LNG tanker ship for gas, we built gas lines with our neighbors like Poland, Latvia and Estonia, witch made it easier for them to get of Russian gas, we have been preparing for this for 20 years.

That's the whole point. I don't understand when people say, ""What's to stop Putin taking xyz country after Ukraine?"" when every country they mention is always in NATO. He can't attack Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway or Turkey, without triggering Article 5 and thus WW3. Presumably the only way that he could do that without it triggering Article 5 is if one of those countries unilaterally decided to attack Russia first and the rest of NATO distanced themselves from it.

Ukraine's great misfortune is that it is not covered by that article, because it's not in NATO, which is why Putin has felt emboldened enough to attack it. Attacking, say, Latvia, is an entirely different thing. I'd say even Putin is not that dumb, but...maybe he is?

At most, these “BTGs” are likely small collections of personnel cobbled together from other units. The Russian military is additionally unlikely to be holding such a significant portion of its force in reserve due to continuing manpower shortages in existing frontline units.

Yeah, I guess it depends on what you mean by 'BTG', even if BTG-equivalent is still being used out of consistency from earlier in the war.

Arguments made in your post would be valid IF they applied to a western nation or military. USSR was not like anything we have ever seen in the western world, the only comparable system would be Mao’s “reforms” as communists put it, in China. The ussr did perform poorly in the first half of the nazi occupation of their so called “great patriotic war” they were not coordinated, and were caught off guard in the initial blitzkrieg the Germans launched at them. Despite what anyone sayS, the real factor here was initiative. Sorta like in chess when you attack with tempo. From 1941-42.5 the Germans had the tempo. They had the ussr on their heels trying to guess where the next offensive would be launched from. 

Many people debate this, but Stalingrad actually was THE turning point of the war. Because it was the focal point of operation Uranus, where literally millions of Soviet reinforcements gathered, they then spearheaded the counter offensive back towards Germany. While at the same time, they had developed new countermeasures that actually ended up exceeding what the Germans had - the T-34. This tank was a point of inflection in the war. It far outclassed the mark IVs the Germans were using as their main battle tank, prompting Germany to start developing heavy tanks like the panther, and eventually the tiger;  but had not the resources to mass produce either of these",facc1fa72a298131154f4485ad4560229077c47b,True,False,,,,,0,1655006588,,0,{},ic1v1jf,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic1bo1h,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic1v1jf/,1655006600,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654977788.0,

I believe that Russia will fortify the regions it has occupied, but as longer range western weapon systems pour in, no Russian will stand firm for the bombardment. 

You mentioned nothing of Russia’s failures, and only spoke of sound and fury for the “losing” side, you’ve betrayed your position as one of the Russian apologists and supporters. 

You obviously will find no fault in your glorious leaders plans or how they’re executed. Putin himself has not been anywhere close to the front, he is a coward, he leads a coward nation and a coward armed force. Zelenskyy demonstrates true leadership, courage and bravery. These are the values of Ukraine that will persevere and overcome Russian aggression, rape, murder, theft and starvation. And when this war is finally won there will be no room for the supporters of the bullshit regime. Russia will have oil, grain, and land, but they will no longer have riches and comforts that they have been allowed by a West that only ever truly wanted Russia to give up serfdom, oppression and cruelty in exchange for joining the rest of the world, it’s too bad you can’t pick better leaders to accomplish this.",f432b5b7a756051c3cef3755509bd99e32b04bf2,True,False,,,,,0,1655006073,,0,{},ic1u75i,False,t3_va9635,False,True,t1_ic1mjxj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va9635/russia_likely_to_seize_all_of_luhansk_in_coming/ic1u75i/,1655006085,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654977273.0,

Also a sense of double standards about how much better Ukrainian refugees are treated than Middle Eastern ones. And a sense of a double standards regarding the Iraq debacle.

In Africa, there is a strong sense that this war is not our problem. Africa has a long history of being caught in the middle of European powers fighting each other, a legacy of colonialism and cold war proxy conflicts and wants to avoid any involvement with either side.

In Latin America, there is a widespread mistrust of American hegemony. Russia complaining about creeping American/European influence play well here.

In Southeast Asia, They are primarily concerned about the threat of China. The Ukraine issue is not an important priority for them. America will be courting their support against China regardless of their position on Ukraine. 

I think the takeaway here is that America and its allies have made serious mistakes over the years that has led to understandable resentment. Yet, the American lead world order is still better than what Russia, China, and/or multipolar anarchy could provide as alternativies.

The realization that it was failing, caused the Russians to withdraw from the North and recommit to Donbas and southern Ukraine. Putin will tell you it was his strategy all along to have thousands of Russians stranded and killed to achieve this, but that just porn for the Russian apologists and backers. 

He committed to an action with a preconceived outcome, that arguably wasn’t supposed to be this violent and bloody, but because of ego, he pursued it further. 

If Taiwan manages to hold off China for 108 days, I would consider that a win for Taiwan as well… until it isn’t 

This war isn’t over yet, and whether Putin sues for peace after capturing enough land, and Zelenskyy capitulates, or whether Ukraine goes on an offensive and captures back territory, this war was an unnecessary one, and one that has so far cost far too many lives, and caused irreparable harm to Russia/Western relations. This war isn’t the end of war with Russia. 

If Putin captures all of Donbas and feels spunky, he’ll head west and try for Odessa and on to Moldova. The West needs to intervene now, and destroy the Russian army in Donbas, or it’ll only be fighting it later further west. 

Ukraine has been giving all they have and if they’ve mislead us in how well they’ve been doing, I don’t fault them. They are not the evil invading garbage, Russia is, and they deserve to pay for it with as many young Russian lives as possible. Eventually Russian mothers and wives will make it very uncomfortable for Russia to continue this war.

4229,[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"&gt; Can't they just slap some ERA even on some of their older tanks?

The 1985 T-62MV variant did pretty much that (though with limited coverage on the sides, and none on the rear), but it's got all the same issues that the basic variant did.  A cramped turret with a huge breechblock meant that tank crews were picked for being of a small stature.  The autoloader was known to sometimes eat the gunner's arms if they were not careful around it, a feature passed on to the T-72s that replaced it.  Said autoloader was also known to eject shell casings rather violently into the cabin sometimes (instead of into the rear ejection port, due to poor alignment), causing burns and serious injury to the crew.  The gun had very crude controls, and firing on the move or on a moving target accurately was tricky even at short range. Second-hit capabilities were limited. It was aggravated by a low rate of fire, very slow traverse for the turret, and limited depression/elevation...  hell, it was impossible to traverse the turret while the driver’s hatch was open, and in a tank with extremely limited situational awareness options, as well as a complete lack of air conditioning, those hatches are usually open.  It was also very slow compared to even other contemporaneous Soviet equipment of the time.  

&gt;  I also meant that newer tanks with better armor could be built, but it would perhaps be barebones in the sense that it wouldn't have the newest sensors because of chip supply issues.

Designing a new tank takes time, to say nothing of development, testing, acceptance, and then tooling facilities for mass production.  We're talking years, here.  It would be more productive to just make stripped-down T-72s...  and sure, that could be done, but without a good sensor suite, it's just another ATGM target, as a lack of situational awareness on even the tanks present in Ukraine today has spelt the death of many a crew.  You're just making cheaper target that makes a cheaper fireball when it goes up, but the crews will take roughly the same time to train.

&gt; I wouldn't underestimate the production capacity they are capable of if they were to put the full resources of the nation to bear on the problem through mobilization.

Production of modern-ish tanks without the modernizations doesn't really result in modern-ish tanks.  While Russia does have a semiconductor industry, retooling that to make the components they'd need for kitting out their existing tanks isn't as easy as, say, retooling a machine shop to switch from making trucks to tanks.  They'd need to build significant industries from the ground up, from collection and refinement of certain materials from the ground all the way to the finished components.  It is not an insignificant undertaking, especially without outside technical and materiel assistance...  something that the USSR had a great deal of back time they underwent such a mobilization as you are suggesting.  Through the Lend-Lease Act, roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945.",bf045952c807ec8678471509a9c1a91523e807ee,True,False,,,,,0,1654998730,,0,{},ic1h700,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic1d2gp,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic1h700/,1654998743,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654969930.0,

The struggle continues in the occupied territories

In the temporarily captured city of Energodar , where the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is located, guerrillas helped two Russian servicemen get to a concert by Yosyp Kobzon. Representatives of the underground told Telegraf about it .

""At night, a couple of orcs from the patrol ended their service in the occupier's army ahead of schedule , "" the guerrillas said.

The guys did not provide any details about the exact location of the liquidation of the Russian occupiers, but there is no doubt about the accuracy of this information. Sources say this is not the first such case in Energodar. After the latest secret ""disappearances"" of patrols, the Russian military has tightened control over the situation on the streets.

""In general, they drink and feel like kings ,"" locals say of the occupiers' behavior.

It should be noted that this is not the first time that Ukrainian guerrillas have been working effectively on the enemy's rear. In particular, according to the adviser to the head of the OP Oleksiy Arestovych, the other day in Kherson unknown patriots blew up a UAZ with a Russian colonel and three other Russian soldiers.

Earlier in Melitopol, which is located deep in the rear of the occupiers, unknown people blew up an armored train on the railway . Due to the actions of Ukrainian guerrillas , there is fear in the ranks of the Russian military .

Sources in the intelligence clarify that one of the tasks of the guerrillas is to create an uncomfortable atmosphere for the occupying forces. ""They (the occupiers - ed.) Have to walk and look around. Better yet, be afraid to go outside at all ,"" explains the GUR officer, whose name the Telegraph will keep secret.",ac8239bc7d34ed739a33cf34d4af095bb792cab9,True,False,,,,,0,1654998309,,0,{},ic1gfax,True,t3_vabm9o,False,True,t3_vabm9o,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vabm9o/in_energodar_partisans_killed_two_russian/ic1gfax/,1654998325,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654969509.0,

They are 100% in an ammo shortage situation and will soon not be able to make use if the majority of artillery pieces that they started this war with, assuming they haven't already reached that point.",1e7bbdfeaab82f4def3731408fe9e0c0f75e7df8,True,False,,,,,0,1654997982,,0,{},ic1ftv3,False,t3_va0yol,False,True,t1_ic0l5rv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0yol/ukraine_pleads_for_weapons_saying_russia_has_much/ic1ftv3/,1654997999,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654969182.0,

Really I wouldn't  blame her entirely though as this was the German strategy since the 90s. Scholz was also keen to move it forward even a few days into the February invasion but thankfully he changed course.

I'm aware of the historical nuance with Germany though. Emphasising diplomacy has been a way to get over the great national shame of the Nazis. Still, part of it was a business decisino for cheap energy and probably the influence of Schroder, the PM before Merkel, who is basically a Russian asset at this point (immediately left to go work for Gazprom, key leader of Nordstream 1/2 and still refuses to leave the employ of Gazprom). 

I am thankful she was no longer in office when they invaded. I don't think she'd have reversed course as Scholz has, she was way too pragmatic and set in her ways. Not that Scholz has been perfect but he's probably been a best case scenario for Ukraine. 

What gets me about Merkel more than anything is her recent commentary where she refuses to admit any fault in her plans. They were a disaster for both Europe and Ukraine as they no doubt played into Putin's calculus to invaded. I'm not convinced that it would have made any actual difference to Putin's plans if things had been different but I think it gave him more confidence to make the decision.",39e596fa64d7e9f269424d24e24a0a7e3ad18dd6,True,False,,,,,0,1654996556,,0,{},ic1d7l5,False,t3_va0r5c,False,False,t3_va0r5c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0r5c/merkel_will_enter_history_as_the_neville/ic1d7l5/,1654996574,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654967756.0,

At least Russia has the excuse of sanctions. The UK? No excuses. Brexit impact so far has been detrimental to at leat £31 billion. That’s conservative estimates.  The banking and financial sector, which basically provided the UK most it’s income and influence has fled the UK. 

Inflation in the UK is set to reach at least 10%. The poor are being told, by Boris Johnson, to take pay cuts, whilst senior management and the mega wealthy continue to line their own pockets by trillions, and increase their monies.

The UK has the second highest energy prices in Europe.  The UK exports huge amounts of oil to the UK which gets sold at lower prices than we pay in the UK.  Oh yes, in the UK, due to the way taxation is set up, we actually get to pay tax on taxes. Meanwhile oil companies in the UK refuse to pass on said tax cuts. Fuel is now just below £2 a litre or over £2 a litre. Each and every week fuel costs are going up.  Come October households area expecting annual fuel costs to go up by at least £800 per annum. Energy suppliers want costs to rise even more - to increase their profits.  

Household Energy Price Index, the UK has the highest residential electricity prices per kilowatt, of 23 countries in Europe and is the fourth highest for gas.

there has been an electricity price rise in most countries but at vastly varying levels.

It ranges from 2% in Romania, 3% in Finland and 5% in Portugal to 54% in Austria. The UK was listed as 21%.

There was even a decline in the Netherlands, Spain and Greece mainly due to government reducing the taxes on household electric bills.

For gas the UK was fourth highest with only Netherlands, Austria and Sweden higher.

The Index noted the UK is reliant on gas and has low storage capacity to cope with rising wholesale prices.

Unlike other countries in Europe, the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas supply. Our single largest source of gas is from the UK Continental Shelf and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway.

“There are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK with Russia and imports from Russia made up less than 4% of total UK gas supply in 2021.”

all of the costs of the energy crisis are falling on to the public, either directly through their bills or indirectly through their taxes. None of these costs are borne by the owners of the private companies: quite the opposite. In the last six months, the value of shares in National Grid and Centrica have leapt 20% above the general trend – it’s a good energy crisis for their shareholders.

In comparison, in France the system remains dominated by EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state. This has enabled the government to directly control prices by imposing a cap of 4% on EDF’s price rises at a cost of €10bn, which has been financed by halving the company’s profits. The private shareholders of EDF have seen the value of their shares fall 25% below the general trend of share prices.",b8db513306ffc543b5ccb371607d253d4a52e5d1,True,False,,,,,0,1654996462,,0,{},ic1d15a,False,t3_v9ut60,False,True,t1_ic089w3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9ut60/the_return_of_banditry_russian_car_industry/ic1d15a/,1654996475,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654967662.0,

The danger for the west is real here for a couple of reasons.

1 - Penny pinching this is directly costing Ukrainian lives.   ie attritioning russia kills Ukrainian soldiers unnecessarily.

2 - Putin will seek a reduction in conflict intensity or a frozen conflict at the conclusion of summer, but Russia will not internally change its footing, ie it will just keep reinforcing and prepare for next war season.   So the west either bites the bullet now, or just faces the exact same problem again in the future, but this time with Russia only having to drive half as far to surround Kyiv, and with a fully prepared army that has learned something about war in Ukraine, and replaced some of its terrible peacetime generals, sorted its logistics, bought more drones etc.   ie delaying a strategic outcome just makes worse strategic outcomes in the future.

You can literally fire a thousands artillery rounds on a defenders trench line and maybe kill or wound just a few soldiers. A lot depends on how well dug in they are and what the spacing between fighting positions is.

OTOH, the attacking soldier trying to reach that position has zero cover.  So while the attacking artillery is causing some casualties to the defenders, the attacking soldiers are suffering much higher casualties as they try to advance across open ground.  Also keep in mind that the defenders also have counter battery radar which they can use to target and destroy the attacking artillery.

It's likely the Russians have more artillery than the Ukrainians do, and they are attempting to simply cause the Ukrainians higher casualties by simply firing thousands and thousands of rounds at them.  This can work, but it takes tons of ammunition, and the attacker has to have a much higher number of guns then the defender has.  If Ukraine continues to get more artillery, it will become more and more difficult for the Russians to maintain their superiority of fire.",ede81cd1bb6e5740a770f4d41a3fc4859fa70038,True,False,,,,,0,1654993327,,0,{},ic17al9,False,t3_v9uwdn,False,True,t1_ic0rah3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9uwdn/ukraines_high_casualty_rate_could_bring_war_to/ic17al9/,1654993344,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654964527.0,

Russian forces continued to conduct ground offensives within the Severodonetsk area, but Ukrainian defenders retain control of the industrial area of the city as of June 11.

Russian forces likely resumed efforts to cut the T1303 Hirske-Lysyschansk highway and launched failed assaults on settlements along the T1302 Bakhmut-Lysychank highway.

The Closure of the nuclear power plants was set in motion by the Coalition of SPD and the Greens in 2001. Nuclear Power was never popular in Germany and always met a lot of resistance. When in 2005 Merkel took over she couldn't stop it because the CDU was in a Coaltion with the SPD. Obviously no new plants were built.

In 2009 she was reelected the new Coalition of the CDU and FDP reversed the decision of the SPD and Greens in 2010 and extended the runtime of the old plants again. In 2011 Fukushima happened knowing the stance of the German people in terms of nuclear energy there was no other option for her as to return to the phasing out of nuclear again. Meanwhile not even the operators want nuclear because it is to costly and way to time intensive to built new ones. The money is better used for renewables.

&gt; Not build nordstreams.
