Not only does Germany import it also reexports natural gas.  Further they could just steal all they want.  At that point Russia either physically disconnects the pipeline, and all their income from it, or they suck it up.  I don't have details of my nation's security related issues and neither do you.  And again you avoid the point...if Russia could afford to cut off the exports then why haven't they.  Your arguments are sophomoric.

Also quickly I want to point out that I mentioned how Germany has learned.  We do that in the West.  We learned in the Gulf war that Iraq's Russian tanks easily exploded from the inside.  Thus the Javelin and NLAW.  Just blows the turrets sky high and 15 pounds.  Russians kearn nothing other than how to worship a frightened dying idiot...or live in fear of him.  Either way it is sad.

But do tell us all as it would be interesting to know where you are and how you come by all this trove of information.  However your afterglow feelings about China argue against that. Canada let a lot of trash immigrate so that's possible too.  But do tell.....

Russia doesn't have LNG compression capabilities to absorb it's gas that goes to Europe.  You can't build a pipeline to Asia as fast as a LNG degasification plant.  Sure Russia can ship it's oil by tanker as long as there are enough tankers but wait ...those sanctions are limiting that.  Oh my.   

Yeah not taking your word on any quotes from anyone.  Nobody in the WORLD, including your allies, will EVER (well nobody living) again bueve the work if a Russian or their supporters.  Poor Ukraine believed you wouldn't invade apparently even after our ""ignorant"" country moved our Embassy out of harms way.  So without a citation not accepting a quote or anything else not backed up with a source from a Russian or their third world supporters.

Geopolitics has almost always been part pragmatism part Realpolitik and part choosing the lesser of evils.  What does it say about Russia that the US would attempt rapprochement with SA mostly for Europe?   It says we'll do anything to see you squirm.  And again the Saudis know there is no future with Russia as you have nothing to offer them.  We've had spats with the middle East before and we'll have them again.  

You keep talking about how great Russia us....you had to start producing cars without airbags because you are so pathetic.  You offer only gas (meaning natural and hot air of boasting) and nothing innovative or modern.  You're economy is headed for a 15% contraction and  back to the 1970's.  

The petrodollar is a mess but we have been pushing for it to come to an end because we are pushing for petroleum to come to an end.  People don't want dollars because SA agreed to sell oil only in dollars!!  That's how it started but the was before the Euro.  A few now feel confident with the Yuan but not nearly as much so as the dollar and Euro.  And Russia's crowning achievement is how you've brought the advanced world together.

Czars sucked, Bolsheviks sucked, USSR sucked, Putin and dictatorship sucked.  I mean you people are rely stupid as you had so many chances to succeed but keep failing.  Maybe it is genetic...or the alcoholism.  

LNG is just trifling more expensive.  And the West controls far more natural gas than Russia currently does.  And with Sweden and Finland now declared and your military decimated by Ukraine you'll not be getting any new reserves from the Arctic.

I live in US and am also very concerned what will happen in US. Sadly, it looks like Biden is going to loose electionS. God, please, please protect us from Trump again, or another clandestine Putin’s supporter and/or idiot. Trump, Tucker Carlson, Fox News (major news network in US), promotes Kremlin’s propaganda almost officially. Would Western countries really took hard decisive steps (TOTAL gas, oil, coal, ALL financial institutions embargo, meaningful large numbers of heavy weapons help), no matter what the cost (granting mutual aid to most affected countries and regions) this war probably would be over already month ago. When sanctions are imposed both side looses. Thing is, cumulative impact of many countries sanctions for Putin are many fold higher for him, than they can be for any single country. Each country faces only fraction of pain, while Putin faces CUMULATIVE pain of them all. 
Look at China. At first they were cautious. Now, when they are not that impressed with West response, it looks like they lean towards idea of taking advantage of timing to take Taiwan. Cost of being weak goes well beyond Ukraine. It can be expected, more willing to appease Putin governments will rise. 
On the example of US and Poland which I know and understand (I don’t understand that well France or Germany) I suspecting the underlying problem of pro Putin politicians worldwide, is Russian global psychological warfare, which successfully subverting large portions of western societies to its nonsense. In US vast majority of Trump’s supporters are simple uneducated people, vastly perceptive to all sorts of conspiracy theories. ALL conspiracy theories have one common massage: your government is evil, they want to take away your freedom and rights, it’s police state run by Military Industrial Complex (or whatever…), start civil disobedience, fight for your rights. It’s easy for Russia, in western world protected by freedom of speech rights, to fuel and lend financial and intellectual expert support (to make lies sound plausible), to conspiracists, through legal official channels, practically untraceable to it. Beside bought, converted, blackmailed politicians, there is also aspect of brainwashed with nonsense people voting for them, which makes those politicians strong. It’s not just conspiracy theories. It’s proxies and trolls pushing rhetorics calculated to demoralize people, undermine core western ideas, split Allies, polarize societies. Flooding discussion threads with fake artificial crowd (to create false impression VAST numbers of people believe or give ear to some nonsense), in hope of taking advantage of human “herd of sheep” instinct etc.

OK that’s enough proof for everyone - you win. No need to supply any details of exactly where they will get the energy from or who will pay for it.

As usual, with world class stupidity, your nation hasn’t realised that Putin can easily sell energy supplies to other customers outside Europe - in fact there’s a very good chance this will happen soon even as your LNG terminals are still in construction. 

The EC President: “If the EU completely cut off Russian oil immediately, she said, Mr Putin might be able to take the oil that he does not sell to the EU to the world market and sell it for more, filling his war chest.”

Umm - yes Central banks are buying Rubles which is why it has strengthened so much. Putin demanded that gas was paid for in the currency and countries were forced to go along with his wishes.

There’s quite a few countries in the world who have found China to be a very reliable ally. The US has sold out virtually all of its friends at some point although its funny yo see you crawling back to the Saudis.

Funnily enough Putin was actually one of the best assets the West had - who knows who will succeed him? More than likely it will be a hardliner.

As for LNG - the fact remains it’s much more expensive than Russian gas, there’s much less of it and it’s much harder to get to Germany - especially when China is likely to outcompete it in the market.

And, no, the EU can’t “do without Russian fuel immediately” - it would be a disaster for European economies.

One consequence of Biden’s idiotic strategy is that the petrodollar is going to come to an abrupt end. When that happens the Dillar stops becoming the world’s reserve currency and will massively inflate as countries get rid of it. Hello hyperinflation and American Civil War.

The Russians have actually increased the money they have taken as they have had to sell less fuel for a greater profit. Interest rates were decrease last weeks and pensions and social provision have been increased significantly. As the rest of the world is dealing with an inflationary crisis Russia has a strengthening currency.

The intervention has been a disaster because it has result in many many needless Ukrainian deaths at a huge expense and usage of military equipment which has largely been captured or destroyed by the Russians.",0218ad0e9599dfd199e7bd5eddd0b4975ee6cf9f,True,False,,,,,0,1655070370,,0,{},ic4u3lr,False,t3_v9pfbx,False,True,t1_ic4tdoq,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v9pfbx/ukraine_is_running_out_of_ammunition_as_prospects/ic4u3lr/,1655070386,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1655041570.0

And yet as they've said in their TED talk - at some point they now raising up someone as a child and how it just dawned on them - Picciolini now seeing life in others.. Now, no longer a so called 'Neo Nazi'..

So.. Perhaps ANYONE can change..

Perhaps all it takes is to just communicate.. With logic, to think about their actions.. To see life in others.. Like maybe someone else other than them actually see's out of their own eyes.. That another person lives just like them.. That any person is so valuable.. Irreplaceable.. That no matter how much evil someone does, perhaps they still can change for the right way..

Christian Picciolini talking about how they were wandering the street when they were young. They saying how lost they were, someone pulled them off the street and gave Picciolini a purpose in life of being a Neo Nazi.. Feeling acceptance..

Perhaps all it takes is to thoroughly communicate logic and caring about each other!

Should be all about apprehending anyone looking to cause harm! And then can go about talking to them to communicate. To talk about thinking about their actions and not be killing and hurting left and right -- to tell them that any person's very life is just like how valuable your own life is! Like to see that maybe someone else is actually seeing out of their own eyes.. Feeling sensation from their skin.. They just inhabit their own body, 'they' just are who they are..

To talk about critical thinking, not mindlessly follow orders, that any persons very life are so important.. 

To just care more about anyone's very life over a piece of perhaps flimsy fabric, material waving in the wind so called 'flag' - its just a flimsy rectangle! It's just a lifeless, inanimate decoration! Can make a flag however design, shape, color you want!

Like.. To realize we can all just life together! Even if they did evil, terrible things, they STILL can change for the right way! And to anyone they've hurt, damage they've caused, regardless can perhaps heal from all this! And maybe, just maybe some day in the future can bring everyone back alive again! Even if all decayed away into the ground, incinerated, broken apart; perhaps all it takes is to even find a fragment of someone's brain neuron neural transmitter to bring them back. Maybe all decayed away, broken apart, but perhaps those atoms, perhaps that material still belongs to them, that's 'them'. How the brain works with neurons which send signals of these special small neural transmitter things to trigger another neuron, the person perhaps traveling throughout their brain as signal from a neuron, perhaps briefly as a neural transmitter. And perhaps can use technology to locate where perhaps someone's remains are located; figure out the past, perhaps via scanning atoms, material off the ground, chemical reactions, what does what, to just see if can figure out the past to perhaps see where someone had died and now where their remains are..

**What about those actively like with shooting a weapon? In a tank** 

All in all, should be not about hurting others, should just detain people, **destroy their weapons**, just to not hurt them! To set an example of the right way. Ie destroy the tracks on the tank, just not anyone inside! Prevent them from going anywhere! Destroy the equipment, weapons, just not hurt anyone! And perhaps apprehend, just do not torture! Just talk! To communicate, so that we may all live together peacefully!

Release fliers all over the place, ie via using these very kinds of drones, drop thousands upon thousands of fliers all over the place to just communicate these very concepts of just logic and critical thinking, caring about each other! Use loudspeakers on drones to speak this information!
