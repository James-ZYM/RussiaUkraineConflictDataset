For years (since the end of the USSR really), the VKS have been complaining about not having enough pilots (and other personel). In 2017, Shoygu was talking about a deficit of 1300 pilots (and complaining of pilots leaving the army after training), but at the time, he said the problem will be solved by the end of 2018 and they were planning on dramatically increasing the number of aviation personnel, up to about 1000 by year for 2018-2022 (see izvestia article [/645337/nikolai-surkov-aleksei-ramm/letchikov-budut-gotovit-tysiachami]), doubts were emitted though as only 150-200 pilots were trained in 2017 but since then the number has really gone up, to around 500/year.

Last year was the biggest graduation ever for the Krasnodar school (which trains all fighter, transport and bomber pilots), with 550 pilots. 300 helicopter pilots were also formed at Syzran (see 1tv [По всей России выпускникам высших авиационных училищ торжественно вручили дипломы from 31/10/2021]
..there are also other schools but much smaller, mostly for non pilot personnel afaik).

TLDR, I don't think Russia is at any risk on that side, they have a record number of ""fresh"" pilots (but with little experience, mostly some flights in Syria).

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Ukraine has rushed all available units into the fight in the East – including a number of poorly trained Territorial Defense Force brigades and volunteer units.

This Twitter post isn't true. UAF are conducting numerous multi brigade offensives elsewhere in Kharkiv and Kherson, both include heavy use of arty too and manpower that isn't TDF tiros. Donbas has priority as the strategic main effort but obviously not enough importance if they're still fighting offensively elsewhere in what would be quiet zones if not for UAF attacks. Quiet zones don't require lots of resupply, especially arty ammo or extra manpower. This is why ""economy of force"" is a principle of war.

Based on the rest of his Twitter posts, I don't think the Rolling Stones reporter knows much about the history of artillery in modern warfare if he thinks it's odd that forward observers (FO) spotting targets can't get rounds on target. Yes, that could be from a strategic, operational, or tactical lack of tubes and ammo, and I'm sure that could be an issue in the Severodonetsk salient campaign. It could also be because of the threat of counter battery and arty refusing missions for fear of revealing their positions, only firing when it's critical. But it also is basically built into the system of how artillery works since modern history, it's the norm.

Before US Army innovations in artillery during WW2, the standard was that infantry divisions had their own artillery regiment (I'll just call that DIVARTY from now on). Typically, they either massed all fires as part of a division operation, with a HEAVILY preplanned fires plan (a simple walking barrage was usually a couple dozen pages long) that was largely focusing on the division main effort (most arty going to support 1x of the 3-4x infantry regiments of the division), or else they might break up DIVARTY and task organize individual arty battalions to support individual infantry regiments, with arty batteries supporting infantry battalions, with the arty battery commanders themselves up forward with the infantry operating as the FOs calling for and adjusting fire for their own firing batteries. So in that situation, when massed, either nobody who wasn't the main effort was getting division artillery. Or if they broke the DIVARTY down so everyone got some, then everyone got less and they still lost the ability to fire at will. 

The US Army changed the processes in WW2 by delegating the calls for fire to dedicated FOs, giving training to all officers to call for fire, mass issuing radios down to the platoon level, and creating fire direction centers (FDC) who operated in every arty battery, battalion, group/regiment, plus having a corps level artillery command that also had it's own FDC. What that meant was a single FO spots a battalion of Germans in the open, and he reports that up the chain for a call for fire. Very quickly that makes its way up to the Corps FDC who decides at that very time it's the priority fire mission and then directs however much of the artillery in the entire corps to fire on it, possibly all of it. 

That is a HUGE win for responsive, massed, and accurate fires, it changed everything. Suddenly anybody who found a good target could get fires even if they weren't the division main effort. Big emphasis on ""good target,"" because that still made all the difference. Whoever reports the best target gets the fires. It's been pretty well known since WW2 and beyond that being a good forward observer wasn't just knowing the call for fire process, having working comms, etc, it was the ability to convincingly bullshit the enemy target description part of the call for fire to guarantee fires. 

Oh, your bde recon company spotted a couple tanks hanging around an intersection and what steel rain ASAP? Then report that as a Russian battalion. Otherwise someone else gets the mission because they're priority, or they save their ammo for better targets because it's not worth firing.

Another thing that controls who gets what is the level, because that decides the number of tubes they control and their daily allotment of ammo. The higher the command level, the more tubes and ammo they control, the more opportunities they have to bring fires on target. This is why centralized DIVARTY is superior to decentralized fires at the battalion or brigade combined arms units, who only have limited artillery just supporting them, with corresponding limited amount of ammo for each. Great if they're all operating distantly from one another, but that's it. Divisions as a command level were very hard to deploy especially for the types of operations that were starting in the mid to late 1990s, which is why so many countries made brigades their main tactical unit (the US led the way and most of the world jumped on board). Many countries went so far as to thin out their command structure by removing the division command altogether. Note, both Russia and Ukraine did that. 

But when Cold War 2.0 started and everyone started thinking ""Near Peer,"" that led the US Army to shift back to divisions, to bring back DIVARTY (where brigade combat teams lose their organic arty back to the division if they operate as a division, so it can be massed and controlled). Even Russia brought back their division command levels too. Guess who didn't? 

Ukraine. They fight as brigades with 3x the artillery in them that a US Army BCT has (too much, they can't resupply that level, which is why the US doesn't do that). AFAIK they have no tactical command level above brigade level, the next level up is a regional command level (only 4x in all of Ukraine) roughly equivalent to division or corps level staff, but instead of having 3-9 brigades to control, some of them are controlling dozens. 

For instance, Operational Command East, based out of Dnipro, controls every UAF brigade and independent battalion in [this operational area](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/OC_East_UGF.svg/1200px-OC_East_UGF.svg.png). 

That's insane, and if still true and they didn't secretly bring back division and corps commands between brigade and operational command, it's a recipe for failure. Like why they are having major logistical issues, why they are shoving barely trained TDF into battles they have no business being involved in, why they can't control their fires properly, etc.",70c8d7eaa007cdff77c1a25327e921e2d767a2c2,True,False,,,,,0,1655077742,,0,{},ic58t9v,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t1_ic4pfqg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic58t9v/,1655077757,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655048942.0

Just some examples:

It's about getting into orbit, without being hit by microscopic pieces of junk with the kinetic force of a cannonball. It would especially hamper the commerical satellite industry since the cost would increase exponentially a long with the increase of microscopic junk.

We've most likely reached the beginning of Kessler syndrome anyways, based on both the increase in sat-sat collisions, debree collisions on telescopes and other large infrastructure such as the ISS.

Anything that will cause fragmentation would be catastrophic for many generations.

A lot of physicists, engineers etc have already noted hat we probably already have reached the starting points of the Kessler Syndrome. It's a slow process, but more and more satellites are colliding, like the Chinese military satellite last year which was only found out about due to an astronomer randomly noticing some oddity in the space debree data on his spare time.

The truth is that, the country that would be enforcing kinetic anti-satellite warfare would be essentially committing a direct (or indirect, given that it might take a few months for the effects to cascade) declaration of war on every country who has military satellites in orbit and an act of terrorism for any country that relies on scientific or commercial satellites in upholding services necessary.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe\_generational\_theory#Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory#Crisis)  
&gt; According to the authors, the Fourth Turning is a Crisis. This is an era of destruction, often involving war or revolution, in which institutional life is destroyed and rebuilt in response to a perceived threat to the nation's survival. After the crisis, civic authority revives, cultural expression redirects towards community purpose, and people begin to locate themselves as members of a larger group.\[41\]  
&gt; The authors say the previous Fourth Turning in the US began with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and climaxed with the end of World War II. The G.I. Generation (which they call a Hero archetype, born 1901 to 1924) came of age during this era. They say their confidence, optimism, and collective outlook epitomized the mood of that era.\[42\] The authors assert the Millennial Generation (which they also describe as a Hero archetype, born 1982 to 2004) show many similar traits to those of the G.I. youth, which they describe as including: rising civic engagement, improving behavior, and collective confidence.  


That was all written in 2007. To me it looks like 2008 was 1929. Going by that timeline things should get real bad and then get real good \[50s\]. Also by this theory it's all the boomers fault.

&gt;...That unfortunately has nothing to do with Russia's artillery shell consumption.

Sadly I have no data on that. I would be very interested if you find any, however. And I will be sure to share if I find some.

&gt;I don't think Severedonetsk is a good place to fight over this much.

Agreed, but I think the issue goes beyond that.

When you look at [Jomini's latest map](https://twitter.com/JominiW/status/1535446548598902785), it becomes apparent that Ukraine has relatively few troops on the East bank of the Siverskyi Donets: some foreign volunteers, the 111th Brigade of the TDF and elements of the 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade - in all, perhaps **7,500 men** at establishment strength.

Most of Ukraine's forces deployed in the salient are already to the West of the river, as seen in this [second map](https://twitter.com/JominiW/status/1535446545574813697). Holding the salient we have, from north to south, **and excluding the aforementioned units on the East bank of the river**:

1. 79th Airborne Assault Brigade
2. 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade (elements)
3. 30th Mechanized Brigade (elements)
4. 81st Air Mobile Brigade (elements)
5. 4th Rapid Response Brigade, National Guard
6. 128th Mountain Assault Brigade (elements)
7. 24th Mechanized Brigade
8. 118th Territorial Defense Brigade
9. 17th Tank Brigade
10. 80th Airborne Assault Brigade (elements)
11. 14th Mechanized Brigade (elements)
12. 109th Territorial Defense Brigade

Needless to say, this is a much larger force than the one holding the city: something like 35,000 men at establishment strength, i.e. \~4.5x the force in Sievierodonetsk. For Ukraine to be taking up to 600 combat losses daily in that sector, it's clear that a large share of the losses must be happening on the flanks of the salient.

Note that with 600 daily losses, in 2 months of fighting a force of \~40,000 men on paper within maneuver units will have taken **100% casualties**.",b292518ff43722b59ca3d27a554e8347e4dccf00,True,False,,,,,0,1655067078,,0,{},ic4n7kn,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t1_ic4jbou,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic4n7kn/,1655067093,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655038278.0

This is already a very high level of mobilization by modern standards. If the U.S. had the same percentage of its population under arms it’s military would be about four times its current size.

&gt;Based on the research of Kofman and Lee, the Russians probably have deployed \~120,000 ground force troops to Ukraine total

This isn't what Kofman and Lee suggests. In a Twitter thread on May 16, Kofman argued that the [125 to 130 Russian-proper BTGs](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219848287674375) deployed to Ukraine had between them [80,000 to 90,000 men](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219851680849926), i.e. an average of 615 - 720 per BTG, rather than up to 1,000. Note that in his [June 2 article](https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/not-built-for-purpose-the-russian-militarys-ill-fated-force-design/) co-written with Lee, Kofman only mentions the lower estimate of 80,000 for 125-130 BTGs.

In the May 16 Twitter thread, Kofman also estimated that the DPR/LPR and the Rosgvardia added a further [20,000 - 25,000 personnel](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219852804935680) in their own maneuver formations.

Thus, per Kofman, the Russian-aligned invasion force numbered 100,000 - 115,000 men within the **battalion-sized combat maneuver units**. But the total force was obviously larger: [up to 190,000 men](https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/594873-reports-up-to-190000-russian-troops-now-along-ukraine-border/) according to the U.S. envoy to the OSCE just prior to the invasion, a figure that explicitly includes Russian Ground Forces, Rosgvardia and DPR/LPR troops.

AFAIK, Kofman never questioned that figure - a figure that's obviously not derived from a BTG count, since it includes Rosgvardia and separatist elements. We also know the U.S. estimate for Russian Ground Forces only - [150,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/nato-says-russia-is-increasing-troop-count-at-ukrainian-border.html) \- just prior to the invasion. Thus, we arrive at the following figures overall:

1. Russia: 80,000 - 90,000 maneuver / 150,000 total ground force
2. Auxiliaries (DPR/LPR, Rosgvardia): 20,000 - 25,000 maneuver / 40,000 total ground force

This suggests that Russia went in with 60,000 - 70,000 personnel in support roles. This figure appears reasonable, given that:

1. Russia organizes its forces under Tank and Combined Arms Armies, all 12 of which were deployed as part of the operation. Each Russian Army has a Logistics Brigade of 2,000 personnel, which suggests that \~24,000 men were deployed in that role for the operation.
2. Russian maneuver divisions and brigades were deployed to Ukraine, serving as higher HQs for their respective BTGs. These formations have their own unit HQ, combat support and service support elements, not all of which were amalgamated within BTGs.
3. Russian Tank and Combined Arms Armies also field separate SSM, Artillery/MRL, Engineer, EW and Air Defense Brigades, of which an unknown number were sent to Ukraine. Looking at Jomini's latest map, for instance, we find the following indirect fires brigades on the north flank of the Sievierodonetsk salient: 120th Artillery, 385th Guards Artillery, 232nd Rocket Artillery and 119th Missile Brigades, which would amount to 3,000 men altogether.

&gt;50,000-70,000 of them have been rendered casualties

This [website](https://minusrus.com/) provides UA estimates of Russian and Russian-aligned combat losses. Unlike the daily updates we have seen previously, it also includes estimates for WIA as well as POW.

For June 10, it indicates:

1. Killed: 31,900
2. Wounded: 95,700
3. Taken prisoner: 1,000

For a total of 128,600 combat losses out of an invasion force of 190,000 men. Given my previous estimate of more than 80,000 - 85,000 Ukrainian combat losses, and given the disaster that was Russia's opening weeks, I find this reasonable - with the proviso that the ""killed"" figure likely includes estimated dead from wounds, whereas the ""wounded"" figure probably only includes those expected to survive.

&gt;That means today there are probably just 50,000--70,000 left

Here I disagree. On May 16 Michael Kofman estimated that Russian reinforcements amounted to [10,000 - 12,000 men](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219855917158400), including mercenaries such as Wagner. This appears to be (1) either a significant undercount and/or (2) Russia has substantially reinforced within the last month.

Thus, on [June 10](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/10/ukraine-ammunition-donbas-russia/) Ukrainian government adviser Oleksandr Danylyuk estimated that over the previous 2 months Russia has significantly reinforced its invasion force. Here's the quote in full:

""*Russia has regenerated its forces to a greater extent than anticipated by many military analysts, bolstering its depleted army by as many as 40,000 to 50,000 men over the past two months, by increasing the age of the reserve force, deploying new forces and refurbishing units that had been decimated, Danylyuk said.*""

Taking the upper bound (50,000) to account for minimal reinforcements also sent in March - early April, we get: 190,000 - 128,600 + 50,000 = **111,400**. To that should be added conscription from the DPR/LPR, which has been undergoing general mobilization since the very beginning of the invasion.

Taking all this into account, I'd estimate Russian-led ground forces participating in the operation to still number **125,000 - 150,000** at this moment, with the share of DPR/LPR auxiliaries conceivably proportionally higher than in late February.

&gt;This means by mid-July the Russian offensive in Ukraine will effectively be over.

I think that's plainly wrong. First, per Ukraine's own reports Russia has been losing an average of [\~600 KIA/WIA/POW](https://minusrus.com/en) per day for the last 3+ weeks. That's 20,000 combat losses per month if we round up. Note that some of these losses are occurring among separatist auxiliaries, so the actual ""Russian"" total is somewhat lower.

Per Ukraine and other sources, Russia is currently massing [40 reserve BTGs](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-june-11) to be sent to Ukraine. These units appear to have been created by stripping officers and contract soldiers from the non-deployable ""3rd conscript battalions"". Assuming they are similarly understrength to Russian BTGs sent to Ukraine in February, this would amount to a force of \~25,000 additional men. Along with DPR/LPR conscripts, that should cover about 2 months of casualties at the current intensity.

But then Russian-led forces also suffered, per Ukraine, close to 100,000 (surviving?) WIA since the beginning of invasion. Unlike Ukrainian losses, those were disproportionately incurred in the first phase of the invasion. With the invasion force suffering significantly lower combat losses, recovered wounded are likely to serve as a major cushion for the force.

To give some numbers, per Ukraine, Russian-aligned forces lost 53,100 ""wounded"" in February - March. Let's assume, generously, that 1/3 are irrecoverable. Russia would still have 35,400 available returnees to allocate back to the front over the coming weeks. Add the 25,000 men in the new BTGs and you arrive at \~60,000. Now add conscripts of the DPR/LPR.

If anything, at their current loss rate I wouldn't be surprised if Russian-led forces make good some of their initial losses over the summer.",d3ed2727cd99c13b9cebd46937bb2138c486eee9,True,False,,,,,0,1655064792,,0,{},ic4ib7m,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t1_ic416hu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic4ib7m/,1655064810,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655035992.0

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"&gt;Would a nation who cannot dominate space, find it in their best interest to deny it to others by making use of it impossible? In the course of human warfare I imagine that someone at some point would have wanted to make the oceans impassable to deny it to their adversaries. Could such a desire by someone, with a relatively unsophisticated missile arsenal, to deny the use of space to anyone else be in the future?

So one thing to keep in mind is a lot of the web discussion on Kessler syndrome tends to overstate the severity somewhat. This is understandable, Gravity was a great film other than hard science accuracy. It's ok for scifi to be science fantasy in my book

But if you go read some more grounded stuff, the general picture I think you'll take away is:

1. Even worst case Kessler syndrome is unlikely to totally deny access to space, just reduce launch windows and available orbits substantially. This is because the impulse delivered to the debris after a collision is constrained by the initial impact, and tends to stay ""banded"" along the original trajectories. So we can move into other planes and altitudes. There will still fundamentally be a ton of room at MEO and higher, and collisions in LEO are the ones that will clear fastest.
2. There's a lot of concepts for how we might clean it up that seem practical the more people look at them. A sibling comments mentions one of the most cool imo, which is using a pulsed laser to gently nudge objects to deorbit, but there's quite a few others. I'd say the odds are good the world figures out mitigations after such an event, even if they are painful to implement in terms of time and money.

So it would be a disaster, but not quite the ""end of humanity in space for centuries"" style event some people are immediately leaping to.

As far as using as an asymmetric threat, like NK tries to deny access to everyone, I think that's less approachable on a physical basis than most are assuming, and is of questionable value anyhow. The big space powers are going to be the ones both the hardest to deny orbital assets, just because of the sheer number they have, but also because their economies and space programs are mature enough to implement avoidance and mitigation strategies that the smaller space powers simply couldn't afford.",d92de81fca5eda9fd04d20a3717f438e7a2691e7,True,False,,,,,0,1655064422,,0,{},ic4hisa,False,t3_vaqp4u,False,True,t1_ic3x35f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vaqp4u/physics_of_war_in_space_how_orbital_dynamics/ic4hisa/,1655064441,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655035622.0

Additionally their forces are concentrated in a smaller front with shorter supply lines -- easier to deliver if you're going to 5 areas instead of 25 -- and they're supplying a lot fewer troops and tubes then they started with, which also simplifies the issue. 

High explosive arty isn't new, and the RF has the ability to make those en masse.  Circuit boards for PGMs?  Not so much.  

&gt; Is 50000 really realistic?

Let's do some basic ""back of the envelope"" math.  

So your Russian BTG has three batteries each with six 2S19 152-millimeter self-propelled howitzers.   3 batteries x 6 guns = 18 guns in the BTG.  Lotta boom.   

The total number of BTGs in all of Russia is estimated at around ~150 (ballpark of 140-170), with about ~90 fighting in Ukraine.  We're assuming full-strength TO/E units here, I'm sure some units are quite short in men or matériel.   

18 guns x 90 BTGs in Ukraine = 1620 howitzers pointed at Ukraine.  

50000 rounds a day / 1620 guns = 30.8, call it 31 rounds fired per gun, per day.  

Assuming a fire rate of 1-2 rounds per minute -- which is sustainable; rapid fire could be as high as ~7-8 rounds / min -- all of the howitzers would fire off 50k rounds in a little over 30 minutes.  Presumably some aren't shooting at all, and some are firing all day long.  

And that's just the 2S19 self-propelled guns; throw in the towed arty, MLRS, etc. and that 50000 round number doesn't seem crazy.  Is it sustainable?

Even assuming that the citizenships were valid, the invasion clearly violated international law, which arguably allows countries to intervene militarily in foreign countries in a limited fashion to evacuate citizens in a difficult situation, but certainly does not allow one country to carve large chunks of territory off of another country under the pretext of protecting its own citizens. 

What's especially fucked up is the Abkhazians conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Georgians in 1989 as the USSR was starting to break up, so to the extent that the local population preferred Russia over Georgia, it was largely because the something like 50% of the pre-1989 population was killed or driven out.

We must have the courage to strategically rethink Europe’s future.

*Andrew A. Michta is dean of the College of International and Security Studies at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies. He’s a former professor of national security affairs tat he U.S. Naval War College and a former senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis.*

In its fourth month, the war in Ukraine has increasingly become a war of attrition, grinding down both Ukrainian and Russian forces, resulting in even more indiscriminate killing of civilians by Russian shelling and the destruction of the country’s infrastructure.  
  
Among Western European politicians and national security experts, there’s now a rising chorus on the need for an immediate ceasefire, with several European governments fearing that unless there’s a halt in fighting, the war might escalate to a point where Russian President Putin will resort to chemical or nuclear weapons. Hence, the palpable diffidence, particularly in France and Germany, about providing heavy weapons to Ukraine, especially those that would allow it to turn the tables on Russia and liberate captured territory.

However, the rising ceasefire chorus in the West also exposes a paucity of strategic imagination as to what Europe could look like if Kyiv were given sufficient weapons and support to defeat the Russian army in the field.  
  
This lack of imagination, more than all other factors, explains the reticent trajectory of French and German support for Ukraine, which allows Kyiv to continue to fight but offers no clear path to victory.  
  
There are similar voices in the United States, arguing that supporting Ukraine detracts from domestic priorities. While other well-meaning critics of U.S. support for Ukraine say we’re merely prolonging its pain, and that the power differential between the two warring countries ultimately means there can only be a Russian victory.  
  
But in reality, all this talk is steeped in residual Cold War-era thinking, with the Russian Federation seen as an extension of the former Soviet Union in terms of its military capabilities. This “don’t poke the bear” mentality reflects the West’s lingering fear of Russia, which, in turn, has created a strong impulse to self-deter, especially now that the past three decades of de facto disarmament have left most of Europe with no real military capabilities to draw on in a crisis. So, we are witnessing endless second-guessing about which weapons shouldn’t be sent to Ukraine to ensure our assistance isn’t seen as “escalatory.”

Despite this, during the past three months, the West, and especially the U.S., has steadily increased its military assistance to Ukraine, making Russia pay dearly for Putin’s folly. And the structure of the latest U.S. aid package is a recognition that this will be a long, drawn-out war.   
  
Still, until Ukrainians can get sufficient capabilities to suppress Russian long-range artillery and missiles, this will remain an unfair fight, with a predictable end. Putin’s forces will continue to grind forward — now holding a corridor along the Black Sea in the south of Ukraine — while slowly but relentlessly expanding in the Donbas. 

Every nation has a breaking point, and in a war of attrition such as this one, those with more resources and capabilities ultimately prevail. But it doesn’t have to be this way — superior motivation, training and especially Western equipment can offset Russia’s numerical advantages.  
  
Let’s first consider the consequences of Ukraine’s defeat. At this stage, any ceasefire would allow Putin to hold on to conquered territory, and the remaining Ukrainian rump state — bereft of its industrial basin in the east and with Russia’s continued Black Sea blockade — would be unable to sustain itself economically. More importantly, in a few years, Putin would regroup, rebuild his military and be able to launch another round of conquest to seize all of Ukraine — especially if the ceasefire deal included lifting sanctions on Western imports critical to his weapons production.

  
In such a future “third war,” would the Ukrainian people still possess enough determination and fortitude to fight back, and would the West be ready to once again provide requisite weapons and supplies? There’s no way to answer these questions in any meaningful way, but it’s reasonable to assume that having effectively lost this war, the Ukrainian nation would find its power position further diminished.   
  
Right now, the greatest obstacle to the West providing all-out military and economic support to Ukraine is our inability to imagine a new power configuration in Eastern Europe — one that would rest on the NATO’s Baltic-to-Black Sea intermarium corridor of countries closely aligned with the U.S. And as Finland and Sweden gear up to enter NATO, Europe is on the cusp of a potentially transformative geopolitical reconfiguration, much like at the end of World War I.  
  
The defense of Ukraine is not only about national sovereignty and territorial integrity — historically, the two foundational principles of democratic governance — but ultimately about pushing Russia out of Europe, thereby ending three centuries of its imperial drive. The independence of Ukraine, and by extension of Belarus — for, once Ukraine has defended its sovereignty and territorial integrity, Minsk wouldn’t remain in Moscow’s orbit for long — would end Russia’s claim to being a key “Eurasian power in Europe.”  
  
As such, for the first time in the modern era, it would force Moscow to come to terms with what it takes, economically and politically, to become a “normal” nation-state. 

At a geostrategic level, the emergence of a free, independent and successful Ukraine aligned with the West would also end the two-frontier crisis that the Sino-Russian alliance has sought to create for the U.S. Securing Europe’s Eastern flank by relying on countries that see their continued close alliance with America as vital to their security, and are ready to do their share to shore up defenses, the U.S. would then be free to focus on the upcoming contest with China in the Indo-Pacific, rendering the so-called “pivot to Asia” debate largely moot.   
  
Last but not least, the defeat of the Russian military in Ukraine would pave the way for a fundamental reconfiguration of the power distribution in Europe, shifting the center of gravity from the Franco-German tandem to a Central European constellation to include Germany, Poland, the Scandinavians, the Baltics and, most of all, Ukraine.  
  
With its vast array of natural resources and as one of the richest agricultural lands on earth, a rebuilt Ukraine — restored not as a post-Soviet state but as a thriving democratic polity and closely integrated into Europe’s economy — would fundamentally change the power dynamics both in Europe and globally.  
  
This war, which has been forced upon Ukraine and the West by Putin’s neo-imperial plan, has already changed Europe. It has presented the democratic West with the kind of opportunity that comes but once in four or five generations — with the chance to remake the Continent’s geopolitical map.

While I’m tempted to dismiss this like I do the takes of most so-called “realists” on this conflict, I think I’ll address it point by point instead to illustrate just how much of an incoherent and morally bankrupt philosophy it is.

1) I’d like to see the author articulate how a political settlement forced upon Ukraine by a Russian invasion would serve to reduce tensions with Russian-speaking Ukranians.

2) Both the United States and the EU have tried over and over again to incorporate Russia into the European security order. The simple fact is that the Russian government (correctly) sees the European security order as a threat to its imperialist and irredentist ambitions. Contrary to what the Kremlin’s apologists might assert, institutions like NATO grow by mutual agreement. Russia will never be part of the European security architecture until it wants to be.

3) “Russian values” in the context of what differentiates it from the rest of Europe are autocracy, corruption, homophobia, and opposition to the West. Not exactly fertile ground for European integration.

4) Many so-called “realists” cite the need for cooperation with Russia on issues of vital importance where there is agreement. Always absent from this claim are any examples of what these issues might be.

5) The 2014 Donbas invasion brought about massive internal displacement and a hardening of views that has rendered these claims of a stark West-East divide in Ukraine woefully out of date. Differences remain of course, but the Ukrainian nation is more cohesive than ever before, and Russia has only itself to blame.

Now, moving on to the actual proposed settlement. Ukraine is supposed to cede vast swathes of territory that thousands of their countrymen have died defending based on little more than a promise from Vladimir Putin that their fates would be settled equitably decades in the future? I’m rapidly becoming convinced that these people call themselves “realists” ironically, because the idea that such a settlement would ever even be discussed is so far beyond the pale that it beggars belief.",41c4a37441ea4b97af45c84d69f6a1d9b36f4e00,True,False,,,,,0,1655058794,,0,{},ic459rq,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t1_ic41fx3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic459rq/,1655058807,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655029994.0

Ukrainian nationalists should also welcome it since it would give them two decades in which to build a broad base of support within Ukraine for their view that Russians and Ukrainians have nothing in common and to propagate this view through cultural ties and exports to Novorossiya. Moreover, they will be able to do so among a much more homogenous Ukrainian population, with the blessing and financial support of the West.  
  
Finally, there is the not inconsiderable security advantage that Europe and the world would derive from establishing a framework in which Russia and the West can compete in ways that would be potentially mutually beneficial, rather than assuredly mutually destructive.                
  
It will be objected that such a settlement rewards Russian aggression. In an imperfect world, however, the morality of punishing Russia (without, mind you, ensuring its withdrawal) must be weighed against the morality of allowing further suffering in Ukraine, especially when the alternative not only stops the bloodshed but also offers a mechanism whereby, under more auspicious conditions, Ukraine could potentially regain its territories. Time, however, is of the essence. The longer settlement negotiations are delayed, the more territory that Ukraine is likely to lose to Novorossiya.  
  
Another likely objection will no doubt be that Russian officials cannot ever be trusted to keep their word. Those who feel this way have a ready-made objection to any form of negotiations, and not just with Russia. The only thing we would point out is that by putting the status referendum a good way off into the future, the means of its implementation will be negotiated not by those who unleashed this war, but by a post-Putin Russian leadership. The type of relationship we will have with those future Russian leaders is still very much in the West’s hands to determine.",1addb4e5b0010f2143c675833c6fda0f890850a5,True,False,,,,,0,1655057027,,0,{},ic41gip,False,t3_vakgxc,False,False,t1_ic41fx3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic41gip/,1655057042,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655028227.0

A lasting settlement must recognize that this conflict will not end with the withdrawal of Russian troops.

He was a U.S. Fulbright Scholar to Ukraine in 2013-2014, and is the author of the forthcoming book, The Tragedy of Ukraine.*

Current Western strategy in Ukraine is not conducive to peace because it does not deal with some essential aspects of the current conflict. It does not deal with the rights of Russian speakers in Ukraine, and it does not address the thirty-year failure to set up a pan-European security system that includes Russia. Both are issues of primary importance to Russia. The relationship between them may not be obvious to many in the West, but for Russia, they illustrate a mindset of promoting Western interests and values at the expense of Russia’s.

It is precisely because of this mindset that the West was caught flat-footed when Russia suddenly seized the initiative to assert its interests through military means. This has left the West in a quandary, with few palatable options. Its preferred means of coercion—economic sanctions—are bound to become less and less effective over time, just as they have been in other countries, which have always found workable substitutes to reduce dependence on the West. Russia’s importance in providing the world with essential commodities, such as oil, gas, grains, and fertilizer, gives it even more economic clout.  
  
At the same time, the political isolation that the West has sought to impose, while it has a certain public relations appeal, further limits the West’s ability to get Russia to cooperate on other issues of vital importance, and forces Russia into new alliances that will invariably be anti-Western. Henry Kissinger has recently argued that institutionalizing such animosity would be historically unprecedented and should be avoided at all costs.    
  
Meanwhile, despite the rhetoric from Kyiv, the war has not brought Ukraine any closer to a resolution of its own internal conflicts. The rise of Ukrainian patriotic fervor is quite real, yet it often reflects the same regional disparities that have divided Ukraine since its independence. No matter how the military conflict ends, therefore, old resentments are likely to resurface, with Russian-speakers once again being blamed for their supposedly divided loyalties. As the popular Ukrainian journalist Mikhail Dubinyanski recently put it, “it took but a moment for the front lines to stabilize, for the traditional internal hate to re-emerge.”  
  
A lasting settlement must recognize that this conflict will not end with the withdrawal of Russian troops. A settlement must, therefore, address three vital aspects of the conflict simultaneously, or it will not last. First, the competition between Russia and the West over Ukraine, which is clearly not going to end after the fighting stops. Second, the conflict between Russian and Ukrainian elites over their respective national and cultural differences, which is only going to intensify after the war. Third, the conflict between Ukraine’s western and eastern halves, which current patriotic enthusiasm has temporarily masked.

Our proposal does not seek to end these conflicts, which are endemic, but rather to shift the competition from the military arena, with its concomitant dangers of escalation, to the arenas of economic well-being and soft power. In essence, this is the kind of competition that the West was engaged in with the Soviet Union during the heyday of détente after it decided that coexistence was preferable to mutually assured destruction.   
  
In exchange for the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of its forces, Russia would be obliged to not annex the regions it currently occupies and agree to hold a status referendum there under international supervision, some ten to twenty years from now. Ukraine, for its part, would accept its temporary loss of control over Novorossiya (the regions of Donbass, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, and Nikolayev), with the proviso that their status will be ultimately determined by the referendum outcome. 

In addition, NATO would formally pledge not to consider Ukraine for membership. In deference to Ukraine, however, there would be no formal pledge of Ukrainian neutrality. This would permit Ukraine to receive a wide variety of defensive military assistance and training from other countries, short of permanent foreign bases and weapons systems capable of striking Russian territory. Ukraine’s security concerns would be further allayed by a formal pledge by Russia that it will not object to European Union (EU) membership for Ukraine, opening the door to the multi-year assistance with investments and reforms that Ukraine will desperately need to recover.  
  
Russian security, meanwhile, would be bolstered by international recognition of Novorossiya (some of the mechanisms used to defuse the dispute over the Free Territory of Trieste and Saarland might apply). A demilitarized zone on both sides of the Russian-Ukrainian border could be created and security further enhanced by the commitment of several key states to ensure the borders of both Ukraine and Novorossiya.   
  
**Sweeteners for Ukraine**  
  
\- A Ukrainian state that is able to pursue the post-2014 nationalist agenda. To obtain Western security guarantees, Russia will have to give up its goal of fully de-Nazifying Ukraine.  
  
\- The firm prospect of EU membership in the foreseeable future. Russia may draw some scant comfort, however, from the fact that the regime that will be built in Ukraine will then be Europe’s headache (as some are beginning to realize).   
  
\- Multi-year aid and defensive weapons assistance for Ukraine.  
  
\- The possibility that regions now lost could eventually rejoin Ukraine if Kyiv provides them with appealing reasons to do so. This will, of course, depend on the policies that Kyiv adopts toward those regions, but Ukrainian authorities will have the better part of two decades, and significant Western assistance, to make their case.  
  
**Sweeteners for Russia**  
  
\- The loss of Ukrainian territory—Crimea permanently, Novorossiya perhaps only temporarily.  
  
\- No NATO membership for Ukraine.  
  
\- Western sanctions lifted on Russia, Belarus, and Novorossiya. One can reasonably assume that the regions within Novorossiya will be more naturally drawn to Russia. The EU should therefore not repeat the mistake that it made in 2013 of forcing Ukrainians to choose between European and Eurasian economic integration. This time around, everything should be done to create a free trade zone that encourages these regions to become a vital bridge linking both.  
  
\- Finally, there is the possibility of Novorossiya eventually choosing to join Russia, should it prove to be more appealing and successful than Ukraine. No doubt, the West will do everything in its power over the next ten to twenty years to ensure that this is not the case.",1e28cd899283c866c49a77712ebcbe6852a72263,True,False,,,,,0,1655057019,,0,{},ic41fx3,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t3_vakgxc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic41fx3/,1655057034,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655028219.0

They were intelligence driven, usually done at 2-4 am when most people are deep in REM sleep. Squirters were those that heard/saw us coming, usually spotting our vehicles or helicopters on the insertion, and were hauling ass outside the immediate area that would get cordoned off because we didn't chase beyond the cordon.

Imagine seeing a movie where DEA driving into a trailer park at 3-4 am and seeing a bunch of dudes in biker outfits running away from the exact trailer they already suspected was a meth lab. Those are squirters, them running away while the raid is happening makes it a reasonable suspicion that they are guilty of something, which is why they are escaping.

The question is what to do with them? If that trailer actually is a meth lab then the very people the DEA wanted to arrest might have escaped, so they must also run those squirters down as well as hit the target house,, arrest them, and question then later. However, what if the intel was wrong and it's not a meth lab, just a trailer with a couple bikers living in it who have warrants over alimony payments. If they only arrest them, the DEA can let them go. Also, the DEA won't know that until they hit the target building and search it. But by that point the squirters might have made it beyond the cordon. That's why cops can't shoot them for running away. 

But we weren't cops. The dangers we faced we insanely worse than what DEA faces. We can't go chasing down squirters because we could literally run into a large ambush the next block over. We can't just rush to tackle people to handcuff them because a lot of our targets wore belts or vests filled with Semtex and ball bearings because they weren't going to allow themselves to be captured alive. Because of the different tactical situations, we were given more freedom that allowed us more discretion because we were more results orientated, and didn't have the options to make mistakes and lose targets that we might not have a chance to get again. And we didn't need to worry about lawyers bitching about everything we did, suing us, injunctions, etc. 

We might have a split second seeing a military aged male jumping the courtyard wall of the building our intel says is the bed down location of an Al Qaeda in Iraq suicide bomb cell leader. Let him run away and escape? Shoot him?

Would a nation who cannot dominate space, find it in their best interest to deny it to others by making use of it impossible? In the course of human warfare I imagine that someone at some point would have wanted to make the oceans impassable to deny it to their adversaries. Could such a desire by someone, with a relatively unsophisticated missile arsenal, to deny the use of space to anyone else be in the future?

I found the accompanying video to be very helpful to understand the concepts being talked about. If nothing else watch the video:

----------------------

&gt; * To describe how physics would constrain space-to- space engagements, this paper describes five key concepts: satellites move quickly, satellites move predictably, space is big, timing is everything, and satellites maneuver slowly. Building upon these concepts are explanations of how competing spacecraft can engage each other kinetically,3 as well as contrast how electronic warfare, directed energy, and cyberattacks might play in a space fight. Finally, these basics are further illuminated via a discussion of how debris created by these engagements can affect later engagements. 

&gt; * A satellite is designed with a specific ∆V budget that acts as the satellite’s fuel gauge. Just as a pilot will know how far they can fly on a tank of gas by looking at the fuel gauge, a satellite operator will plan satellite maneuvers based on how much ∆V is left in the satellite’s budget. Importantly, unlike an airplane that can be refueled, once a satellite is launched, it currently does not have the ability to increase its ∆V budget. 

&gt; * This means a LEO fight will be complicated because of the large number of satellites that are moving very quickly and are spread over many orbital planes. However, as explained in this section, even satellites in LEO maneuver slowly. A “quick-strike” rendezvous attack in LEO would require a very large ∆V budget for the attacking satellite—and would not be quick. 

&gt; * The Indian test is similar to the U.S. test, with very short-lived debris clouds for both events due to their low intercept altitudes (less than 300 km or 190 mi.). In contrast, in 2007, the Chinese intercept of FY-1C, a nonoperational Chinese weather satellite, occurred at an intercept altitude of 856 km (532 mi.) and, therefore, created debris likely remaining in orbit for decades.20 

&gt; * If an adversary threatens a satellite by being in the same plane, there are few good options for the target. Kinetically destroying the adversary satellite may create debris that then threatens the very satellite being protected. Furthermore, other spacecraft will have to fly through the debris cloud. Debate continues on how many engagements would make space unusable.24

According to the Ukrainian Navy, ""The intensity of Calibre cruise missile strikes has now decreased, while the enemy has begun to hit ground targets with anti-ship missiles, the main purpose of which is to destroy warships and ships.

It is assumed that Russia has used up a significant amount of its modern missile weapons and is forced to use outdated types of missiles, the stocks of which are sufficient for strikes on the territory of Ukraine.""

[This](https://www.refworld.org/docid/5137368a2.html) is an actually comprehensive article on the political officer system. All tactical level political officers are zhidaoyuan - political instructors. Commissars (zhengwei) only exist at the operational (brigade and division) level but their responsibilities don’t change. To quote,

&gt; The three levels of political officers above have basically the same key responsibilities:
&gt; Implementing decisions made by the party committee;
&gt; Instilling party discipline among party members;
Providing political education to the troops within their organization;
&gt; Working with other components of the political work system.

Moreover, “As a general rule, political officers who become unit political leaders or deputies at the company level have not received any formal education or training to become a political officer”.

In other words the PO is the equivalent of the senior NCO and the chaplain of a unit, who doesn’t even get ideological education until he rises to senior command. Moreover, even at that level “They also attend a short or long in-residence course at NDU for division and above officers, but the focus is not on political work”. Frankly, it’s obvious this is the way it works in China, because for a long time China didn’t even have enlisted ranks.

For example he personally likes Putin, thinks he doesn't deserve to be prosecuted for getting ""tripped"" up in this Ukraine business by believing his generals and FSBs lies about how the Ukraine would roll over and the military would be able to overwhelm Ukraine.

Conversely he tried telling countries like Poland they need to get serious and armed, and not with helicopters and shops but a heap of guys with rifles and ""bazookas"".

Well would they really need to do this if Mr Nice Putin is to be believed.

His views on France, German and Italy are depressingly on the ball. Firstly Germany publicly delcaring they wouldn't provide arms to the Ukraine and wouldn't punish Russia by turning off the Nord Stream was a huge green flag for Putin. 

Furthermore he made it clear that the French, Italians, Spanish and Germans were happily ~~sucking~~ taking Russian ~~петух~~ money. Hence why were not sending any substantial offensive weaponry to the Ukraine (several divisions of tanks and artillery). 

Finally he foresees the Allies pulling the rug from underneath the Ukrainian if they end up looking like they'll achieve total victory. 

Apparently no one wants a crippled Russia. 

personally I think he has failed to acknowledge that Putin has ordered the deaths and torture of thousands of people.

[],False,,BigBennP,,,[],,,,text,t2_bf6pl,False,False,"&gt;If weapons came on the scene that neutralized air forces as powerfully as the proliferation of ATGMs has neutralized tanks, then in many ways maybe we really would come to a new iteration of pre-tank World War One-style combat, where artillery rules the battlefield.

I would put forward a slightly different paradigm.  We're witnessing another shift in the ebb and flow of cavalry operations that has existed for Millennia.  

Dating back into prehistory, horses were useful in warfare. A man on horseback could move faster, sat higher up, and was (most of the time) more effective in a fight.   

but training a horse to charge into a crowded mass of men is hard, and without stirrups, a charge with lances didn't really exist yet.  so most mounted warriors fought with bows and arrows or hand weapons from horseback.  Charits were invented that gave archers a more stable mounted platform.   

At some point, some technological advances, the invention of the stirrup and better armor made mounted knights into a force that were considered the pinnacle of fighting capability.  The knights were prized and infantry were thought to be for lower intensity fighting and for mopping up. 

But tactics changed.  Crossbows in Italy, Pikes in Italy and Switzerland, and longbows in England evolved to fight men on horseback wearing heavy armor.  Cavalry once again became a balanced part of a fighting force, capable of moving fast and hitting hard, but not the pinnacle of combat prowress.   ""Heavy cavalry"" - armored knights capable of breaking lines still existed to a degree, but declined as their uses became very specific, and light cavalry mostly remained. 

Muskets were invented and used, but slow reload times meant a cavalry charge was still effective as cavalry could close the distance before a second volley went off.  Bayonets turned muskets into short spears to use against a cavalry charge. But the formations necessary made infantry vulnerable to artillery.  So in the napoleonic age, Cavalry was very useful, but only in specific tactical circumstances.

In WWI advances in artillery and automatic weapons meant that men and horses in general were far less survivable.  The British envisioned the first tanks as mobile pillboxes. Able to break enemy lines and bring fire to bear, and they were enormously successful.  But it only took a year, 1916 to 1917 before the Germans adapted, learning to use their existing 37mm and 77mm field guns in direct fire to destroy tanks, and developed new weapons like the 13mm mauser anti-tank rifle, usable by a 2 man crew, and commanders learned that tanks needed to be accompanied by infantry to look out for and suppress anti-tank weapons.  Tanks were thought of as mobile guns for infantry support mostly.

Between the World Wars, Clausewitz, Rommel, Patton and others started thinking of tanks not as lumbering mobile pillboxes, but as the new heavy cavalry. Mobile, heavily armored forces Able to charge and strike before enemies could field the heavy weaposn necessary to defeat them. And they were right.  The ideas they invented have remained the core of armored doctrine since WWII and heavy tanks have remained some of the first line fighting forces of any nation able to field them. 

The war in Ukraine is showing that the pendulum has shifted back a bit.   Smart man-portable ATGM's are a bit more expensive than pikes and crossbows, but they serve the same purpose.   

When a 25 year old mercenary from Venice or Milan with six months of training and a ratcheting crossbow could defeat a knight with a lifetime of training and wearing thousands of dollars of armor, and riding a trained warhorse,   commanders stopped being so cavalier about unsupported heavy cavalry charges.  That's about where we are now.",97b04be3f95d60db002d081c13c7c8898e6a2b79,True,False,,,,,0,1655035479,,0,{},ic2v432,False,t3_v9w3cj,False,True,t1_ic2e0lo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9w3cj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_11_2022/ic2v432/,1655035496,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655006679.0

All of these numbers are from the BTGs lacking men, primarily in infantry privates and truck drivers. Kofman and Lee associate much of Russia's problems to this, and not a lack of NCO leadership or ""the tank is dead"". 

It's not particularly clear what the 190,000 number put out by some Western intel agencies at the beginning of the invasion really meant. Kofman believes it might have been the total number of Russian army personnel gathered for the entire invasion, maintenance workers and supply sergeants and all.

Neither Kofman or Lee have talked directly about what Putin and the Kremlin were thinking prior to the invasion, and I'm not smart enough to guess at that. They certainly knew they weren't going into this at full strength by failing to formally declare war, but they might not have understood just how much of their army only existed on paper.

This is just one data point, one opinion by a single pair of experts. Kofman and Lee could be wrong. But given the capabilities of American intel, if these numbers are true they would know it. And if the Americans know it, Ukraine knows it. It forms in my mind at least the most logical explanation for why Ukraine is keeping some of their best troops under murderous artillery fire for weeks on end when they could retreat. 

You make a good point about Perun's video.

[],False,,NecessaryAd7226,,,[],,,,text,t2_nl8tgrnl,False,False,"I have been wondering about Ukraine's current capabilities to shift forces from one front to another. For example, some people have wondered about the reasoning behind Ukraine's decision to attack around Kherson and to hold at Severodonetsk. I think that it is possible that Ukraine currently does not have the logistical ability to shift substantial forces from one front to another, and so it is possible that Ukraine is attacking around Kherson instead of reinforcing the Donbass front not because they actually would prefer to do that, but because they are not able to shift substantial forces from the Kherson front to the Donbass front. If that is the case, then it makes sense that they would rather do something with their forces on the Kherson front rather than just have them sit there. And it is also possible that they have not retreated from Severodonetsk not because they would not prefer to, but because they understand that an attempted retreat there might turn into a rout. In other words, it is possible that Ukraine's current planning is restricted by having limited ability to move forces one way or another. Ukraine may be currently building up powerful reserves that are not ready yet, meanwhile their forces that are currently engaged in combat on various fronts cannot really shift far one way or the other because there is not the logistical capacity to make that happen.

I have no idea what Ukraine's current ability to shift forces from one front to another is like, but I know that historically, such shifts are generally very difficult and take time even in the best of conditions. I also have no idea what the current status of Ukraine's combat-ready reserves is like. I imagine that it is likely that currently Ukraine is in a position where their combat-ready forces are all engaged on various fronts and it is not really feasible to reposition them to other fronts, meanwhile there is a campaign to build new forces but it is not quite done yet. Hence perhaps an attempt to attack at Kherson with the forces available there because why not, you might as well do something with those forces where they currently are while lacking the ability to reposition them elsewhere. And also the attempt to hold in the Donbass salient - maybe the fact is just that there is no master plan to hold that salient, it is just that those forces cannot be withdrawn one way or another without it probably leading to even more losses than would happen in the case of a determined attempt to hold the present ground in the salient by all means necessary.

Admittedly a good portion of that is me personally crunching the numbers. Around a month ago [Kofman](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219837013385216) put out a twitter thread laying out his basic theories on Russian force structure, later expanding on it into a full [article](https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/not-built-for-purpose-the-russian-militarys-ill-fated-force-design/) with Lee. Their basic premise is that Russia only invaded Ukraine with 98,000 (!) ground troops, there have been about 110,000-127,000 deployed total, and they've lost 10,000-12,000 dead with a \~3.5 dead:wounded ratio. Using that you can figure out the number of Russian soldiers remaining and the like, as [I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8vxpw4/?context=3) at the time. 

That was a month ago of course, and more recently Kofman has been putting out 15,000 as an upper bound on Russian dead (it was in one of the War on the Rocks podcasts, I wish I could remember which one), so I updated those figures to 10,000-15,000 dead.

Based on the research of Kofman and Lee, the Russians probably have deployed ~120,000 ground force troops to Ukraine total, and 50,000-70,000 of them have been rendered casualties. That means today there are probably just 50,000--70,000 left, most of them in artillery/air defense etc. Whatever the exact number is, it's clear that the current Russian force is incapable of making large scale advances even after concentrating so many troops in the Donbass they're struggling to hold onto Kherson and Zaporizhia.

I previously thought the most recent callup would amount to around 50,000 troops, but it's becoming increasingly clear that it will have less than 20,000. Russia only managed this by cannibalizing its training battalions, which means it will be many months before it can field replacements trained to even a fraction of that quality. Given Russia seems to losing ~100 men a day, and the ~1:3.5 killed:wounded ratio given by Kofman and Lee, Russia will have exhausted those reserves in less than a month and a half. Up that to 150 killed a day (pretty likely if they're attempting to push through Ukrainian defenses) and they'll be back to where they started in less than a month. Maybe even worse off, given widespread refusals the fight in the Russian forces.

This means by mid-July the Russian offensive in Ukraine will effectively be over. That sets a pretty strong timeline on everything. Ukraine has strong defensive terrain available in Severodonetsk/Lysychans'k, then at Slovyansk/Kramatorsk, but afterwords it's mostly open ground all the way to the Dnipro river. If Russia manages to establish a defensive line on or near the southern Dnipro it will be exponentially harder for Ukraine to retake the eastern territories, no matter what forces they have.

So everything depends on the defenses in the Donbass holding out for a month. We can't know everything the Ukrainian army is thinking, but it appears they don't believe that Slovyansk/Kramatorsk can hold out against the full month of Russian attacks... but maybe it can hold for half a month if the Russians spend 2-3 weeks taking Severodonetsk/Lysychans'k.

In essence: The whole ""900,000 reservists"" claim from before the war started is a complete error, and that Zelensky's statement of 700,000 mobilized and ""fighting"" is...a bit padded.

[The official Ukrainian whitebook for 2019-2020 deals with the subject of conscription and reservists,](https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/files/whitebook/WB_2019_2020_eng.pdf) with the relevant info between pages 76 and 86.

Basically, that claim about 900,000 reservists was sourced from the ISS, just isn't correct and the real number that Zelensky would have been able to draw on for *trained manpower* was something more like 400-500,000 upon mobilizing (from the reserves to the active forces).

Again, much more of this is explained in the comment I linked, and backed up with the MoD whitebook.

Ukraine does not actually have the manpower levels necessary to endure anything from 600 casualties a day in it or higher, if the Russian strategy is ""Sit back and hope the artillery kills them all"" while using everyone that's not a Russian soldier to try and press the attack, without consequences for later stages in the war (which is to say, liberating the territories, but any other strategy will be needlessly harder too).

From Zelensky's and the MoD's statements on the KIA and WIA rates, the numbers they're giving for Russian personnel kills which has been solidly around 150 a day now when comparing their [May 28th numbers](https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/general-staff-russia-has-lost-30000-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24/) to their [June 10th numbers](https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/general-staff-russia-has-lost-31900-troops-in-ukraine-since-feb-24/).

We can confidently assume this is considerably higher than the real count, and it's entirely possible that the grind-rate has almost evened out between the two.

While I don't believe Russia will still be able to further conduct (successful) offensives in the next few months that would get them much anywhere than they already have, this presents serious problems for Ukraine if they're planning to take back the territories using a ""long war"" approach; grinding the Russians down, while taking minimal losses, and building up your army for later.

I'm starting to agree wholeheartedly with the ""pull back to Lysychansk"" side for what Ukraine should do. Fighting it out in Severedonetsk just doesn't make strategic sense if they want to be able take all of these territories back with the manpower pool they have right now.",f02e677211b6b7fd73d90d500f125646f403b8ad,True,False,,,,,0,1655002871,,0,{},ic1oqhp,False,t3_v9w3cj,False,True,t3_v9w3cj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9w3cj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_11_2022/ic1oqhp/,1655002885,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654974071.0

I wonder if it occurs to Zelensky that he could be dealing with Donald Trump again in a few years, and however the war ends they will still need huge outside help by that time.

[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"&gt;I keep seeing various numbers for reserves thrown around:

I'll try making sense of them in this post.

&gt;Ukraine had 900,000 reservists at the beginning of the war.

This figure is sourced from [the IISS](https://www.iiss.org/publications/the-military-balance), which states that in early 2022 Ukraine had 900,000 reservists throughout all services (""*Joint*""). It defines reservists as people having had ""*Military service within 5 years*"", which would currently be 2017 - 2021.

The problem is that this is plainly wrong. Ukraine's latest [MoD White Book](https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/files/whitebook/WB_2019_2020_eng.pdf) plainly states (p. 76) that it conscripted ""*over 30 thousand citizens*"" in 2020, of which only ""*about 16.5 thousand*"" were sent to the Armed Forces - the balance serving in the National Guard, Border Guard and State Special Transport Service.

On p. 78, we even have the precise number of soldiers conscripted as well as released by year, from 2017 to 2020 (only for the Armed Forces proper): 70,000 were inducted during those 4 years, whereas 47,300 were released from active duty. Note how the text specifies that conscripts cannot be deployed to the JFO area, which, *ipso facto*, means that none of them could have had combat experience before the February invasion.

Note that Ukraine also inducted ""37.9 thousand people"" under contract in 2020 (p. 76), as Ukraine was trying to build a professional military prior to the full-scale Russian invasion.

Combining conscripts as well as retiring contractuals, we'd get a figure of, perhaps, a little over 100,000 discharged from the active force between 2017 and 2020. Incidentally, Ukraine's TDF as well as reinforcement reserves grew by 83,700 personnel between 2017 and 2020 (p. 85).

Thus, it is obvious that the figure of 900,000 reservists is a mistake on the part of the IISS. Sadly, it appears to have become ""common knowledge""... Something which now provides people with a false impression that Ukraine has an effectively unlimited amount of trained manpower.

&gt;Zelensky said 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers are participating in the war (he said ""fighting"" specifically).

He did say that, but the figure is impossible. The most generous interpretation I can provide is that Zelenskyy is doing creative accounting:

1. Total size of the active Ukrainian Armed Forces, pre-war: 196,600
2. Territorial Defene Forces: 144,300
3. Reinforcement Reserve: 84,500
4. Ukraine National Guard: 60,000
5. Ukraine Border Guard: 42,000

This amounts to 527,400 personnel. Throw in volunteers, both foreign and domestic, as well as green conscripts currently undergoing training and maybe also those projected to be called-up within the next quarter and you **might** arrive at an overall figure of 700,000 personnel, including the wounded in hospital, the PoW awaiting trial in the DPR as well as the dead - and even then the total is probably something closer to 651,000, but *rounded up*.

&gt;These two things are precisely why a lot of people think Ukraine can just take these losses and brush them off.

Indeed. But once you start digging in you realize that all those big figures are either (1) misinterpreted and/or (2) outright fantasies. And then it becomes apparent that current Ukrainian attrition is barely sustainable, and realistically forecloses any possibility of Ukraine amassing any operational reserve for a major summer counteroffensive...

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Before the war, analysts cited large exercises like Zapad as proof that the Russian military had evolved yet,

Large scale exercises are near useless training opportunities below the company level, even with live fire exercises, as they're always too sterile, scripted, and overplanned. 

But they're great tools for command and staff at battalion level and above, to learn aspects of operations they normally never get to practice such as planning and executing movement including railhead ops, logistics, comms, etc. To prevent the exercise turning into a very visible clusterfuck means some level of competency that translates over to war. 

This is also why the US Army has been pushing for more large scale exercises too, so they can practice those things. Historically we stopped because the Cold War ended and then the GWOT. When Cold War 2.0 started enough legitimate complaints were made that the old school lessons that field grades especially need to know were lost, and they knew it and wanted the chance to relearn them. All while the Russians were already doing those same large scale training exercises on the regular, with Western foreign observers in attendance being impressed. 

However, it seems that the Russian training was overly scripted, to especially small unit combined arms training, making it unrealistic, so not only a waste of training for them it was actually hurting them.

In reality, I think that it probably goes both ways. Deliberate regime efforts have moved the window somewhat, but to some extent also the regime has always been trying to position itself roughly where the pre-existing window was

AFAIK, putin did move the window a lot, after 2014. Up to that point, he positioned himself as very centrist, making him essential for the balance of power. However, he realised the hawks to his right were so extreme, he could throw the doves to his left under the bus and they'd still prefer him to the lunatics to his right.
