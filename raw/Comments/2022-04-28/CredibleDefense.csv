In terms of disagreeing, Kofman also says things that differ from Lester Grau, who was actually former US Army infantry officer as well as Russian focused Foreign Area Officer, who upon retirement has been doing intensive research and publishing open source on recent Soviet military history and current Russian military ops since the mid 90s. If you've ever read anything written in English about the Soviet Afghan War or the Chechen Wars, chances are he either wrote it or they're quoting him. So who's right? Kofman or Grau?

In terms of BTG organization, function, manning, I'm basically quoting Grau. For example:

""The BTG serves as a means of keeping elements of a larger formation (such as a brigade or regiment) immediately ready for combat, as these formations are typically not fully manned and their equipment may not be up to the same readiness standards. As recently as the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Russia had difficulty deploying and massing combat power. BTGs permit Russia to maintain better trained, rapidly deployable units as rapid reaction forces to buy time for the full mobilisation and deployment of brigades and divisions in the event of an unforeseen, rapidly developing, large-scale conflict.""

https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/getting-know-russian-battalion-tactical-group

In terms of small unit stuff, I'm going off what I read from Grau and the battle order website that describes motor rifle squad platoon and company, which sources Grau and actual Russian military manuals. 

https://www.battleorder.org/rus-bmp-platoon

Go Google Kofman, read up how much he's gone into the nitty gritty of unit organization. I've searched because in the last month plus I read/listened to nearly everything he's every been involved in. But I don't find anything. Because he seems to be more big picture. Nothing wrong with that, his job and audience doesn't require it. Grau's does, he is who Americans (including military) go to when trying to learn the minutia of especially ground forces. Not the tech shit, but organization, doctrine, training, culture, etc.

We announced earlier we were planning on leaving but we had been saying that since December 2009. Saying and actually executing are two totally different things because the latter involves planning, coordination, etc. We didn't warn our NATO allies, nor the Afghans, nor American citizens in the country. We gave no warning because we didn't follow a plan, as there was no plan, as when JSC and CENTCOM and Afghan Cdr asked for time to create one once Joe said ""we're leaving"" his response was no plan, we're leaving now. I personally think he just didn't want arguments and months of hassle and wanted it done with. Okay, fine, but he made his decision and has to accept the repercussions.

That shitshow lack of planning and horrific decision making absolutely caused the collapse. Caught totally by surprise the Afghan senior govt had no clue it was even going to happen when it did BECAUSE NOBODY TOLD THEM. They literally found out watching the news. That triggered panic as word spread. You're on a sub called credible defense. You should know what happens when panic happens during military operations, especially when the Taliban who knew it was coming and had actually planned for the occasion to launch an offensive when they got the news. It triggered a rout. As that happened and it was clear Kabul couldn't be defended (as communication and order collapsed) the senior leadership booked out and everything collapsed at that point.

Most ANA conventional units had no ability to hold ground but it was believed ANASOC could and would fight but they needed air support, for fires, transportation, resupply. The US was providing a lot of it and coordinating ALL OF IT. Even with Afghan helicopters and fixed wing aircraft of their own they couldn't pick up overnight to take over, which was the only option after the US pulled out without warning our allies.

So...for one.... about 2/3rds of that weight is inert metal. The xplosives in ammunition are typically around 1/3rd of their weight. So there is probably something like 6,000t on explosives there.

But that is not all.....

Its split between what looks to me like 30 warehouse/bunkers. So you'd expect each to have roughly 200t of explosives.

A nuclear bomb is so devastating as all those kt/mt of explosive go off in the same millisecond in a sphere the size of a basketball. That makes a big kaboom.

But something like this ammo dump would go off in 30 seperate locations.....and even each of those smaller 200t sites over the course of hours and days as rounds cook off bit by bit.

Thats a lot of smaller kabooms spread over a much longer period.

""20,000t of ammunition, containing 6,000t of explosives, spread over 30 ammo bunkers, and cooking off over hours/days"" does not equal ""one 20kt nuclear explosion"".

Even going back to your nukemap link and adjusting it to be 0.2kt (equivalent to one bunker going off in an instant)....gives only 20 injuries, and no deaths and I suspect most of those are caused by the radiation radius which touches some nearby houses (which doesn't apply here).

The blast and thermal damage (from the site centre at least) don't reach the houses..... except the ""light blast damage"" area (in grey) and the description for the kind of damage that can do is ""break glass windows"". And, agaim, this is assuming a whole warehous goes in an instant rather than cooking off for hours.

I wouldn't exactly like to live in one of those houses only 400m or so from the nearest warehouse/bunker, it certainly could still be unhealthy, even deadly, to those who live closest.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,[],,,,text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False,"&gt;My commercial GPS equipment allows 0.005m v &amp; h accuracy. Even a cheap phone gets you 5m, do you need anything better?

&gt;Commercial grade handheld GPS units are able to obtain coordinates with a horizontal accuracy of approximately 3 meters if the unit can receive a wide area augmentation system (WAAS) signal; otherwise, the accuracy is approximately 10 meters. This type of GPS handheld unit provides elevation data with poor accuracy.

I'd imagine its the vertical accuracy that may be the bigger problem. Not so much an issue for navigating a city, but a lot of an issue when lobbing a shell through a 3D space trying to hit a target. If its significantly worse than 3m...lets say 10m.... that'd put a shell a long way off target all on its own without the horizontal inaccuracy.

I'm also not sure you'd get the additional WAAS signal you need to get it down to 3m out in the middle of the UA countryside. I'd suspect there you are talking being out somewhere around 10m horizontal + &gt;10m vertical error range with commerical GPS.

I'm not sure how your commercial equipment has an 1/2 cm accuracy, because I think thats beyond the capabiities of even the military grade systems. 

&gt;How is it possible to be less accurate? The solutions are the same movement equations you learn in middle school, as long as you can detect the rounds the calculations are the same.

Because you have to detect their position at least twice, preferably more often, with extremely high accuracy, and for really, really, really tiny radar targets moving very, very fast in potentially a very noisy environment. This isn't a trivial engineering challenge.

The better you can do so, the more accurate the location you can give for the originating point. I've seen it reported that the russian stuff is less accurate than the US kit and I've seen no reason to disbelieve this. Almost everything the russians have seems to be less accurate than the latest US kit, and the M777 and their fire control radars are the latest gen NATO versions.

&gt;Again, why this assumption? An networked automatic weather station in less than $100 and available at every hardware or garden shop, why would they not have access to similar? 

They do....by ""manually recorded"" I meant using such a station and enterring those values into the firing calculator at the (non-networked) fire control unit. Probably a better station than the commerical one you have given that it'd be specialised for the task.

Although perhaps I over-egged it a bit here. I suspect they've got this bit networked to the fire control station by now, at least in their latest kit, would seem to be the easiest bit to do. 

Despite that.... the russian towed artillery is not an integrated networked solution as the US system is. Nor can it use US military GPS or have access to US higher-gen radar accuracy. And the solutions from their Fire Control vehicles still have to be radioed to the gunners who have to use analogue dials and bubbles to get the gun level and set the gun to the solution the fire control center radios to them.

The US use a totally digitally integrated system for all of this now connecting the gun to the radar, computing the solution, and pointing the gun to the solution automatically (and with better inputs).

That system helped create the absolute best NCOs of the war, since most others did OJT (not a good way in a meat grinder), but it wasn't sustainable for the Germans as it removed leaders from where they needed them and placed them in schools in the rear (which is why nobody else bothered).

The US Army copied the concept of NCO academies from the Germans but that's it. They promote experienced junior enlisted (if one isn't a piece of shit they'll get promoted to sergeant no later than 5 years, usually within 3-4). NCO academies are mandatory but they're a joke, and aren't even MOS specific till the second line level but still a joke. The most crucial phase to train NCOs is as first line leaders, they need to learn both leadership and TTPs related to their job, but that doesn't exist. 

Once past the second line leader role, to Sergeant First Class, the role of the NCO is less about leadership and their job and more about logistics and administration. By the time they reach Master/First Sergeant, they're effectively administrators whose job is ""senior enlisted advisors"" for commanders whose rank is supposed to indicate they understand how enlisted think/operate.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"I listened to it. His breakdown is odd and some of his conclusions I don't agree with. For instance

-  Is the peacetime 70% manning levels in relation to the brigade/regimental level? Because that would not be equal throughout every BTG, it defeats the entire point since the BTG was created to ensure actual fully manned (or as close as possible) combined arms maneuver battalions actually existed. As I mentioned before, in a system like that the first BTG would likely be better manned than a second or third unless they tried equalizing them before going into combat

- His motor rifle description was off, at least from what I've read. BMP and BTR have 3x crew while driving but when they dismount two of the three trucks have the SL dismounting, leaving the gunner to act as deputy VC and taking orders from the PSG who remains in his truck. That means in full strength squad 2x mounted and 6-7 dismounts (squad plus platoon HQ personnel). If their platoons are light it's very likely they do the same thing the US does, start out by not filling junior rifleman positions and then start on assistants to certain crew served weapons, etc. But the idea of every vehicle only having 3x dismounts or less before the war? Other than the occasional terribly manned brigades/regiments, I doubt it was that bad. In terms of no dismounts? That seems pretty crazy.

- He mentions conscripts didn't deploy to Ukraine but we know they did and even Putin publicly admitted this, even kind of apologized in that he said he was going to launch an investigation to find out how the miscommunication had occured. But AFAIK, conscripts aren't used in combat arms slots, so that shouldn't have affected the infantry anyway, unless they used conscripts to fill up the third BTG per brigade/regt and top off the others

Whatever the prewar numbers, they're likely suffering heavy infantry manpower shortages but they'd also be suffering vehicle shortages too, not only from combat losses but also maintenance related. This war is two months old and there is no indication they're rotating units to the operational rear to conduct depot level maintenance, so there are going to be a lot of deadlined vehicles. Are they pushing replacement vehicles to the theater?

The US only purchased a 4-digit number of them to begin with, and neither the US nor other users are likely to give the majority of their stock to Ukraine.

Contrast that with the number of dumb rounds provided to Ukraine by the US alone, which was 183,000 last I heard.  Other countries are also supplying dumb rounds, so the total amount of 155mm used by Ukraine is enormous, probably over a quarter million rounds so far, with many more coming in the future, while there's a low fixed bound on how much M982 can be sent even if we empty the shelves. In percentage terms, extremely little of what's fired is going to be M982.

That's a round you use with a lot of care. I'm not trying to argue that they don't provide a valuable capability! My point is merely that its capability cannot be treated as representative of the artillery - it's a specialized thing. We don't even know that Ukraine is getting the higher range increment 2 shells, and the older ones only have about 23km of range.

The round also requires specialized training, so it isn't like every UA arty crew out there is going to be lobbing at Russian equipment.

&gt;What tends to actually happen is that extra weight and equipment is added independently. We just got access to some cool new thermal optic? Better bring that with us, it could be a real help. There's some new piece of comm equipment that can work when out of radio range? Let's get someone to carry that. All this new equipment gets brought along because it's useful. No platoon sergeant is actually out there and cross-loading each soldier's ruck down to the pound, and getting everyone to some imaginary load limit. Instead, as new equipment becomes available, infantry are naturally saddled with the most useful bits and the weight naturally keeps increasing. Periodically, those weights get so high that there's some clamoring to reduce weight, and that's how you end up with stuff like polymer ammo.



The thing is, it's not the platoon level making those calls, it's force level. There is a standard load out that is expected to be carried which likely has a weight cap. If you reduce the weight in some other area, you free capability in another. 

Like, our IOTVs got significantly light even with just Gen IV, but that still gets eaten up because of the capability. Not to say that it isn't better to have more capabilities from lightweight gear, but the end load is still going to fall in roughly the same place. More ammo, batteries, optics, explosives, clothing, water.

3. This is objectively false and bad history.  The Soviet Union had conscription, but so did everyone else, negating many of the downsides, further, the Soviet Union troops were as well trained as any in the war despite what Hollywood wants people to believe

4. When everyone is using conscripts there is no comparative disadvantages.

5. What would you like?  A copy of the Royal Institute report on Russian use of western technology in their missiles?  A report from a think tank about their tank and airframe production?  The Russian Government themselves came out and admitted they needed import substitution and has asked Russian industry for input on how to replace key components domestically. Is  a Russian admission not enough for you?

6. Depends on the metric you're using and your expectations for their post sanctions economy. It will considerably shrink, especially if you're using GDP/per capita.  

7. I agree, a long war likely requires some form of large scale armed forces expansion.

8. A command economy is neither efficient nor desirable for Russia. None of the ""command"" economies in WW2 fared better than the ones who maintained a more ""normal"" system of supply and demand.  The USA didn't resort to a command economy and they underwent the largest expansion of production of anyone. The changes Russia could do would be rationing (not necessary because the bottlenecks aren't in any consumer goods that I'm aware of), import controls (they're already doing this), currency controls (already doing this), and a few others.  The rest isn't a huge benefit. 

9. I agree. We'll just have to wait and see. 

10. I disagree, I think Russia is mostly already doing everything they can production-wise.

&gt;
&gt;\- Logistics is a problem, but not one that can't be improved. A country that could provide 10-15 million with food and ammunition in 1943 can certainly supply a million soldiers today.


Even more so since (from what I recall) conscripts staff these units heavily. 


&gt;\- Training would be a huge problem. But if you are going to win a war you are better off with 200k professional soldiers plus 1,000k mobilised ones than just with 200k professionals.

This... is mostly true. However, if your logistics is overly burdened supporting your inferior forces, you may just end up starving your truly effective units. And having 100k pros and 200ks effectively supplied is probably worse than 200k pros effectively supplied. 

There is also a morale issue. If you are constantly watching conscript units get eaten up, you may become more hesitant to join them. 


&gt;\- Public supports drops much faster if you lose a war. Without mobilisation Russia (in my opinion) cannot win the war. Well, they can, if they use tactical nukes, which is the only alternative.
&gt;

Russia has probably a ~25% chance of taking the Donbass in the next two months. I doubt they would be able to withstand a counter attack from a full mobilized and western armed Ukraine however.


&gt;\- They don't need new equipment for mobilisation. They have plenty of Soviet-era stocks, which would put them at the level of an average Ukrainian unit.

These are debatable.


&gt;\- I don't think Russia can run out of tanks, artillery or guns in the mid-term no matter how bad the losses in Ukraine are.
&gt;

Russia is actually at a serious risk of running out of it's current active duty armored vehicles *if the current rate of attrition continues*. The large scale corruption and lack of maintenance was visible even on units entering the conflict, and their depot spares are likely much worse. Rusted to hell T-72s probably do more to complicate your own logistics situation than they gain you in effective combat power. 

I could also be wrong on this, but the logic follows.



&gt;\- Are there alternatives? Mercenaries are not going to provide the 200k needed to at least match the Ukrainians.

Before they only had shake and bake junior NCOs who only did two years as normal conscripts, being slightly better recruits chosen to the extra 1-2 months of NCO training (the much better conscripted recruits were sent to academies to become commissioned officers). They had the equivalent of certain company or higher senior NCO positions, mostly administrative, but they were being done by warrant officers who were former conscripts (again, the better conscripts who wanted a career were usually commissioned).

After the New Look the warrant officers were initially turned into senior NCOs with the rank initially dissolved but then brought back to do certain technical jobs. Junior enlisted doing any technically advanced position or involving combat arms would be better paid volunteers serving 2-5 year contracts, and their NCOs were promoted from those on career tracks similar to Western armies.

However, the Russian system is a bit weird. All contract soldiers are technically NCOs because they get paid and treated better than conscripted junior enlisted, but their pay isn't just tied to pay grade rank like most Western armies but also on time in service and position. For example their equivalent of a sergeant doing a squad leader job gets paid more than a sergeant not in a direct leadership position or lesser. Plus there is no ""Up or Out"" so they have the ability to stay as junior NCOs, essentially do a whole career as a squad leader, while continuing to get pay increases based on time in service. The US Army and Marines used to have that option though they didn't get much money but it was removed in the 1980s. 

The Russians definitely put more responsibilities and power on their commissioned officer corps, akin to the US before the 1960s and after, but it's much different now than it was before the New Look reforms, at least in terms of junior officers and NCO relationships. Russian junior officers are still required to do far more than Western junior officers and are considered the actual subject matter experts (their schooling is very long) but their NCO corps was gradually becoming more empowered.

McClellan was focused on preserving his command. His tactic would have worked along with the anaconda tactic to exhaust the south by refusing to attack and forcing the confederates to do at greater losses.

McLellan was wrong about the politics though, the Union would not have been able to sustain that war of attrition politically.

Internet shitposters have been unkind to McLellan because while he was incorrect for political reasons, he was not gun shy or even inherently wrong in a strategic sense.

Grant was far too aggressive in some ways, ordering George Henry Thomas to attack at Nashville when conditions were not ideal.

When the time was right, and Thomas launched his attack, he destroyed the confederate army.

And I mean decisively defeated it in the sort of military operation Clausewitz lusted to see. I mean it was utterly destroyed as a fighting force, and after that defeat, there was no serious Confederate resistance west of the Appalachians. 

McLellan was not a bad general, Grant was a good one, if too aggressive at some moments, but George Henry Thomas never lost a movement or a battle. 

At battles where the rest of the army was defeated, most notably Chickamauga, his units always succeeded at their objectives, including holding off the entire confederate army in a rearguard action. 

He met Jeb Stuart at a skirmish before Manassas and kicked his teeth in.

Thomas is largely not remembered because he was a southerner who fought for the United States. He should be.

To quote him:

&gt;The greatest efforts made by the defeated insurgents since the close of the war have been to promulgate the idea that the cause of liberty, justice, humanity, equality, and all the calendar of the virtues of freedom, suffered violence and wrong when the effort for southern independence failed.

Respectfully, I really think you're wrong on this. I initially was a bit of the mind that it was the wrong move, that more ambiguity would have been better. 

But I have come around to thinking that it was exactly the right statement. 

Ruling out direct combat between Russia and NATO effectively limits russian escalation pathways - it says loud and clear ""We aren't attacking you, don't you fucking dare attack us"". 

It also serves to provide cover for everything we ARE doing to help: Sharing intel, recon, AWACS, training, weapons systems, ammo, etc... 

We're doing everything up to the line of providing in-country combat forces.

2. The country that supplied those troops was supplied with ungodly amounts of aid from the Allies to do it. 

3. Warfare has changed.  In 1945, it might have taken a week to plan, organize, and supply an offensive. Now you have hours or a few days and that requires a requisite number of trucks, trains, and manpower that Russia doesn't have and can't conjure from thin air.  There is a reason they're using dump trucks and school busses as troop transports. 

4. The amount of supplies needed for the kinds of offensives Russia is contemplating have changed since 1940's. Especially Russia with their large, mechanized formations. 

5. It took years to build the capacity to supply those troops in ww2. Russia took twenty years to build that capability.  A capability they did not create before invading Ukraine.

6. I disagree that conscripts automatically become a net bonus regardless of skill/equipment/etc...  I don't think you will find much agreement from any experts on that either.

7. Russia can come to a number of agreements they can sell to the public.  Especially while they have leverage. Conscription+ losing the war + sanctioned is much worse than simply losing.  Russia has options that include both keeping their regime intact and not mobilizing. 

8. I agree, Russia won't be able to win any war in Ukraine without some type of armed forces expansion.

These vast stores that supposedly exist from the Soviet-era likely don't actually exist in a usable form. If Russia had these vast reserves of high-quality equipment it would be visible on the battlefield.

[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"Here you go, I'll just re-post it, I was trying to avoid re-posting huge walls of text that is just my opinion. Basically, conscription doesn't solve the following:

1. Russia has logistics issues due to a lack of poor conditions/vehicles/staff/supply stocks. Conscripts without logistics capability would hurt Russia, not help it. Just a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field does not conquer Ukraine.

2. Equipping conscripts is a huge problem. Russia is being caught with expired rations, stolen cars, 1950's medical equipment, guys rifles from the 1800's (a bit of an exaggeration, but not really), unencrypted radios, trees tied to trucks in improvised slat-armour, knock-off tires, non-functional ballistic vests, and Chinese knock-off motorcycles, etc.. And that's BEFORE a huge mobilization. Mobilization isn't going to fix the problem of being unable to equip and feed all the guys they already sent out, much less a larger army. Trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. This isn't 1918 where a lot of guys just needed a rifle and uniform.

3. The usefulness of all those troops is suspect. Russia's army in Ukraine suffers from a lack of ""TRAINED manpower"", not just ""manpower"". It isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around.

4. Conscripts generally suck. They don't want to be there, they surrender, fight poorly, cause confusion, don't properly follow orders, and die easy. There's a reason countries avoid using them.

5. They might not be able to ever properly equip a large force due to bottlenecks in their military economy. While mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you would need like I talked about in point #2. (and that is a more realistic thing that Russia needs) Serious analytical reports show that Russia is already trying to do that to the best of their ability. Mobilization isn't needed if they can never hope to equip the guys they draft.

6. A lot of the Russian advanced weaponry to fight properly might be finite due to sanctions. There are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion. Apparently they have also been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc.). Russia doesn't have a big economy. They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They might not have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip a huge army properly. It takes years sometimes to build factories and production facilities for some of the stuff they'll need.

7. Timeliness is problematic. You also need to train all these people not just build equipment for them. That takes time (months) and the war might be, mostly, over by then.

8. The economy might be as bigger a problem than soldiers. Mobilization hurts your economy. Public support for war declines when your economy takes a dump and living conditions decline. You also need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war. Right now, Russia's central bank is preparing for a massive decline in the economy. Possibly millions of new unemployed, hundreds if not thousands of businesses in trouble, and dozens of banks at risk of default (which will wipe out everyone's savings or drive up inflation if the central bank tries to bail them out). Never mind what will happen if countries stop buying oil. Mobilization just adds to the problem.

9. Legal issues. Conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan). People don't like being used as cannon fodder and dying for bad reasons.

10. It might be pointless already. As mentioned in other points about equipment, while Russia might have an immediate manpower problem now, the bigger issue is likely a materiel problem in the long-term. Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate. Planes, Tanks, IFVs, Supply Trucks, UAVs, Artillery, SPGs. Stuff they can't replace quickly. Stuff that takes years to produce and you can't fight a modern war without. If Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose them, and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with old AK-74's getting mowed down by USA built Rocket Artillery. Mobilization doesn't solve the materiel problem.

11. It might not be worth the cost given the alternatives. You can activate semi-trained reserves. (Russia is already trying to do this but there have been some reports of issues).

Which ones? 

The point of the BTG system was because brigades and regiments were usually so understrength it was meaningless to think of them as actual tactical units because nobody knew what they possessed without closely examining each. Whereas they all had enough strength to fill at least one battalion tactical group to as close to full strength was possible, with the goal to have two  per bde/rgt with a third filled by reservists and limited bde/regt cadre in time of war/mobilization. 

Grau and others have said before the war most bde/regt were fielding two and in some cases three BTGs. I seriously doubt they were all uniformly manned, especially since Russia uses an unofficial tier system where their better units get the better gear and manpower (like VDV, MP, Guards motor rifle and tank) while other units get the dregs, the last were likely poorly manned. Plus BTGs that were the third and maybe even the second in their bde/regt who were their unit's ""red headed stepchildren."" Probably BTGs pulled from lesser important military districts like the notoriously underfunded Eastern MD. Etc.

Military spending isn't a issue for China, and certainly hasn't been for over a decade. They have the largest nuclear power industry in the world that is continuing to grow, which directly corresponds to their ability to create nuclear weapons. 

&gt; china also has no way to intercept a significant number of state of the art nuclear missiles, nor is it likely to gain this capability in the near to medium future

Nobody has the ability to intercept a traditional ICBM when fired en masse. Nobody will in the near future, or likely ever.

&gt; china also already has a 0% chance of eliminating u.s. or russian second strike capability

China has seven SSBNs in service, with eight more in the pipeline which will give them capabilities close to the US and likely exceeding Russia in the near future. I'm not sure what difference it makes, any mass launch of ICBMs on the US would be detected and the US would return fire before impact. China likely has the same detection capabilities. Second strike is a mostly irrelevant theory that predates early warning systems for ballistic missiles. 

&gt; therefore, at this point, wouldn't further nuke building weaken (however slightly so) the u.s. and russia by creating a financial burden for no additional power

The US has no plans to expand their nuclear arsenal, it is presently shrinking as the current plans are only for 12 Columbia-class SSBNs to replace the existing 14 Ohio-class SSBNs. The Columbia-class will feature 16 tubes for the Trident D5 over the 24 tubes(20, by treaty) of the Ohio-class. The number of warheads will likely remain the same although it could be easily increased as the present fleet only has 4 of 12 possible re-entry vehicles per missile.

And how long is the 2014-2022 NCO corps going to last in this war? I can't imagine very long within combat arms, it's too bloody and junior NCOs at the squad and platoon level have historically taken nearly 1:1 casualties for junior enlisted. 

A long serving professional NCO corps is great in peacetime or conflicts when casualties are light, relying on subject matter experts at small unit operations is obviously a major force multiplier. But how are they replaced in long war meat grinder conflicts? 

They really can't be without a major loss of knowledge and capabilities as they take too long to create. Western militaries take 2-4 years minimum to create the lowest level NCOs and more years as they go up in rank and responsibilities (until reaching senior NCO rank, where they become less useful and knowledgeable).

1. Russia has logistics issues due to a lack of poor conditions/vehicles/staff/supply stocks. Conscripts without logistics capability would hurt Russia, not help it. Just a bunch of dudes starving to death in a field does not conquer Ukraine.

2. Equipping conscripts is a huge problem. Russia is being caught with expired rations, stolen cars, 1950's medical equipment, guys rifles from the 1800's (a bit of an exaggeration, but not really), unencrypted radios, trees tied to trucks in improvised slat-armour, knock-off tires, non-functional ballistic vests, and Chinese knock-off motorcycles, etc..  And that's BEFORE a huge mobilization. Mobilization isn't going to fix the problem of being unable to equip and feed all the guys they already sent out, much less a larger army.  Trying to expand the army might make their front line problems worse in the short term while they try to make their army bigger. This isn't 1918 where a lot of guys just needed a rifle and uniform.

4. The usefulness of all those troops is suspect. Russia's army in Ukraine suffers from a lack of ""TRAINED manpower"", not just ""manpower"". It isn't as helpful as you can imagine to just have a bunch of semi-trained dudes standing around. 

5. Conscripts generally suck.  They don't want to be there, they surrender, fight poorly, cause confusion, don't properly follow orders, and die easy. There's a reason countries avoid using them. 

6. They might not be able to ever properly equip a large force due to bottlenecks in their military economy. While mobilization could also include key military industries to build up the materiel you would need like I talked about in point #2. (and that is a more realistic thing that Russia needs) Serious analytical reports show that Russia is already trying to do that to the best of their ability. Mobilization isn't needed if they can never hope to equip the guys they draft. 

7. A lot of the Russian advanced weaponry to fight properly might be finite due to sanctions. There are also reports that they are having trouble sourcing components for their big ticket items since the 2014 invasion. Apparently they have also been outsourcing a lot of their supplies due to corruption, production, and quality control issues (even basics like MREs, Tires, uniforms, medical supplies, ammunition, etc.). Russia doesn't have a big economy. They're on the same tier as Canada/Italy. They might not have enough money, factories, raw materials, or countries willing to help them equip a huge army properly.  It takes years sometimes to build factories and production facilities for some of the stuff they'll need. 

8. Timeliness is problematic. You also need to train all these people not just build equipment for them. That takes time (months) and the war might be, mostly, over by then.  

9. The economy might be as bigger a problem than soldiers. Mobilization hurts your economy. Public support for war declines when your economy takes a dump and living conditions decline.  You also need your economy running as smoothly as possible to pay for your expensive war. Right now, Russia's central bank is preparing for a massive decline in the economy. Possibly millions of new unemployed, hundreds if not thousands of businesses in trouble, and dozens of banks at risk of default (which will wipe out everyone's savings or drive up inflation if the central bank tries to bail them out). Never mind what will happen if countries stop buying oil. Mobilization just adds to the problem. 

10. Legal issues. Conscription is a legal issue in Russia and has caused them to lose wars in the past (First Chechen war and Afghanistan). People don't like being used as cannon fodder and dying for bad reasons. 

11. It might be pointless already. As mentioned in other points about equipment, while Russia might have an immediate manpower problem now, the bigger issue is likely a materiel problem in the long-term. Russia is losing materiel at a completely unsustainable rate. Planes, Tanks, IFVs, Supply Trucks, UAVs, Artillery, SPGs. Stuff they can't replace quickly. Stuff that takes years to produce and you can't fight a modern war without. If Ukraine keeps getting weapons faster than they lose them, and Russia keeps losing equipment much faster than it can be replaced, all you're going to have is a bunch of dudes with old AK-74's getting mowed down by USA built Rocket Artillery. Mobilization doesn't solve the materiel problem.

12. It might not be worth the cost given the alternatives. You can activate semi-trained reserves. (Russia is already trying to do this but there have been some reports of issues). Or you can try to hire mercenaries (Russia is doing this too but, again, problems.)",2969f5bf3184e612f25d02a3239d16af33ff5c6a,True,False,,,,,0,1651168235,,0,{},i6k6u3q,False,t3_udtbzp,False,False,t1_i6k09f3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6k6u3q/,1651168253,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651139435.0,

A senior U.S. defense official just concluded the first Pentagon background briefing about Ukraine in several days.

It’s Day 63 since Russia invaded.

Some highlights: 
Notable: While the Pentagon does not assess that Russia has seized control of Mariupol, the senior defense official said today that a “significant” number of Russian forces are beginning to shift from the port city to the northwest. 

The shift comes as a small number of Ukrainian forces hold out in Mariupol. The Pentagon has predicted previously that when Mariupol fell, it was likely some Russian forces would join the fight in the Donbas region. 

The forces leaving Mariupol so far have shifted northwest, in Zaporizhzhia oblast, the senior defense official said. That’s roughly south of the major city of Dnipro. 

“They’re continuing to pound Mariupol with strikes, both airstrikes and missile strikes,” the senior U.S. defense official said. “You don’t do that if you think it belongs to you.” 

As of Thursday, the Pentagon assesses that Russia has about 92 battalion tactical groups in the war. 

That’s up several more from last week, as Putin’s forces continue to reset units after their earlier failures and put them back in the war. 

The senior defense official said that there appears to be about 20 additional battalion tactical groups that are outside Ukraine, but nearby. Their operational status is not yet clear. 

The new numbers highlight a condensation of Russian units after they got sliced up earlier in the war.

There were originally more than 130 battalion tactical groups arrayed at the border. There appear to be somewhere close to 110 left. 

In the Donbas region, Russia has so far had “slow,” “uneven” and “incremental” progress, the senior defense official says.

Ukrainian forces also have pushed them back in some areas, he adds. 
Russian forces are now moving only a couple of kilometers per day, in what appears to be a concerted effort to not outrun their supply lines, the senior defense official said.

That’s a notable change after Russians did so early in the war &amp; then failed repeatedly. 
As of today, the Pentagon assesses that more than 1,900 missiles have been launched at Ukraine in 63 days, the senior defense official says. The majority are now landing in Mariupol and in the Donbas region. 

As of today, the Pentagon assesses that 60 percent of the 90, 155mm howitzers it has committed to Ukraine so far have arrived in country (roughly 54).

That’s up from about half of the 90 yesterday. 
Training of Ukrainian forces on several systems continues outside Ukraine, senior defense official says. That includes not only the howitzer, but Q-64 short-range air defense radar and the M113 armored personnel carrier. 

Meanwhile, @SecDef is meeting today at the Pentagon with his Canadian counterpart, @AnitaAnandMP. Canada this week said it will provide M777 howitzers and some long-range, precision Excalibur rounds that can be used in them to Ukraine.",79f39672b2e5ee07632c5247cbadc679c5b5a56f,True,False,,,,,0,1651166517,,0,{},i6k2j65,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t3_udtbzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6k2j65/,1651166535,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651137717.0,

How does history prove that? Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nobody's ever been given an actual launch order originating from their country's lawful nuclear authority. Nuclear countries understand that it's not an easy order to carry out, which is why they put a lot of effort into training and conditioning their nuclear weapons operators to carry out an actual lawful launch order without question or delay. 

If Curtis LeMay had successfully browbeaten Kennedy into a first strike on the Soviet Union, there's no indication that SAC bomber crews would have refused en masse, despite the orders coming at the behest of a bloodthirsty lunatic.

History only shows that nuclear weapons systems tend to be fairly resilient to glitches, mishaps, and errors of judgment.

Quotes:

&gt; * Logistics over-the-shore, or LOTS, is essentially about benefiting from a wider array of options when existing facilities are limited or unavailable—being able to load and unload ships outside of fixed ports.

&gt; * In Vietnam, during the Cambodian Campaign of 1970, port constraints nearly derailed operations after restrictions prevented ammunition download in Newport, Saigon.

&gt; * ...US forces in Iraq used commercial ports to download huge quantities of supplies. In the first Gulf War, US and coalition forces used Saudi Arabia to build up combat power in the region over the course of five months. Ahead of Operation Iraqi Freedom, forces used Kuwait to build up combat power in the region, again for about five months. 

&gt; * This demonstrates again the American preference for building up sustainment in relative safety before launching a grand offensive to achieve victory.

&gt; * Benefiting from hindsight in both cases, the preparation time far exceeded the time required to accomplish the operational mission; such a permissive timeline was critical to mass requisite logistics.

&gt; * American forces have largely enjoyed relatively robust, multimodal, and unthreatened logistic lines of communication at the operational level in its recent operations, while expeditionary logistics—particularly from the sea—have atrophied. 

&gt; * While the precise weapon system used to sink the Russian ship has not been confirmed, the incident illustrates a reality that the US military must face—that of long-range attacks on logistics nodes. 

&gt; * To manage this risk, the Army needs to commit to an approach that maximizes survivability and flexibility and not cling to the assumption that guaranteed sufficient contracted port support will exist. 

&gt; * In reality, this flexible and survivable logistics approach is just a natural continuation of modernization efforts directed by the 2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2022 version recently delivered to Congress.

The conventional narrative of Rwanda's post-conflict development is challenged by today's guest, journalist and author, Michela Wrong.

&gt;From the get go, everything started going through the known place *ass*. At the start of March the brigade moved towards Rubezhnoe. Advanced from north. As witnesses described, on one of the forest roads at the approach to the town the column stopped and sent forward reconnaissance. Reconnaissance discovered two Ukrainian strong points. Ukrainians were not suspecting anything. For 40 minutes at the brigade they were deciding what to do. In this time, Ukrainians spotted the column and opened heavy fire from mortars and artillery. In this attack, the military personnel of our battalion halved without entering combat. Further I'll be writing about my own battalion, since I'm not familiar with actions of others. 
&gt;
&gt;At the time, myself together with Vit'ka and Irishman were in Luhansk trying to join the war, I wrote about this here. The Irishman through his acquaintances in hospital was claiming some monstrous numbers of 200's and 300's, but I didn't believe back then. As I realised later, we couldn't leave because those who were meant to transfer us were busy delivering 300's and identifying 200's. Later, at the battalion location, light wounded who were coming back confirmed the losses. 
&gt;
&gt;After this defeat the battalion dismounted and laid down. Frost, snow, we laid down under shelling for three days. Starting fires was forbidden. Frostbitten in large numbers were added to the existing losses. Basically, by the time of the assault, only about a third of personnel was left in the battalion. 
&gt;
&gt;Next, with support of brigade artillery there was an assault of the northern part of town with 5-9 storeys buildings. 
&gt;
&gt;Ukrainians didn't defend them and fairly quickly fell back to prepared positions in the private residential areas. At the end of March, Chechens housed in these buildings and posted staged videos about them 'heroically' cleaning up the 5-storey houses that were cleared two days before them. 
&gt;
&gt;Yet what began next was a complete f*ckery. As a strong point the Ukrainians used concrete garages - those are in the right part of the image 3. Higlighted with red are the quarters they were defending. 
&gt;
&gt;They prepared positions superbly. South of the position was a low ground protecting from artillery. It was connected to communication pathways. At the ends of the streets leading north through the village were concrete pillboxes. In the village quarters 'fire bags' were organised beforehand - those were cleared crossfire sectors with machine gun points in basements and prepared sniper positions. And in those 'fire bags' were carefully laid pathways with smashed-through sheds and fences. Fighters attempting reconnaissance by force go through yards so as to avoid going through streets that are shot-through. They don't know who made these pathways - possibly our own. And through these pathways they came under cross-fire of machine guns and snipers. Groups perished without even realising they were being shot at. 
Look at the chaos of housing development. In yards nothing at all is visible - everything is blocked with fences and houses. 
&gt;
&gt;A group entered one of those 'bags'. Immediately nine 200's. The commander was without a scratch. He came back, took more people, and went to pick up the 200's the same path. Had three more killed. And so - for a week. In the end, there were twenty 200's that couldn't be picked up for several weeks. An order to 'pull out 200's' became equivalent to 'go and die'.",ab01c43ae42e34d8e8eba2199433715943791a46,True,False,,,,,0,1651163171,,0,{},i6ju7bw,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t3_udtbzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6ju7bw/,1651163183,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651134371.0,

1. The Russian offensive in the Donbas is looking pretty ho-hum so far. Russia in general is doing bad. The media worldwide has been pushing a narrative that Russia is trying to accomplish something quickly. As such, people are getting nervous that since Russia can't get any battlefield successes, they'll use a nuke, a narrative that has been slung around a lot. People like Fiona Hill feed into this narrative and are experts, ergo increasing fears.
2. Putin made a speech yesterday for the first time since February really tossing around the nuclear threat. Lavrov made a comment about World War III the day before that got amplified in the Western media at pretty much every level (I heard it on my local news). This got amplified far more than Peskov or Medvedev's statements from last week about restrained nuclear usage. As such, nukes got forced to the forefront of the national conscious again and people start talking more about them again. Nuclear threats sell papers, after all, or get clicks or whatever.
3. Inflammatory rhetoric on Russian state media seems to be stepping up regarding nukes. Yesterday's ""We'll all die but at least we go to heaven"" comments were so absurd that they made a splash on the internet worldwide but also amplified the fears about nuclear war.
4. There is this new rumor going around that ""intelligence people"" are getting more concerned about nukes which could mean just about anything from ""I wrote this analysis that says nukes are more likely now than at the start"" to ""we overheard Putin and friends talking about firing nukes in private"". It's getting picked up and rolled around on various social media platforms and therefore is amplifying fears.
5. Nuclear fears just get more attention than anything else. Russia knows this is a potential lever they have to rattle Western public opinion, so they're pressing that lever a fair amount and making sure everyone hears it.

I'm a nuclear paranoid person. Very paranoid, like losing sleep thinking about it all the time paranoid. But I've not seen anything in the last few days that has made me feel like it's significantly more likely than before. I also haven't seen anything that indicates a strategic nuclear exchange is more likely. I worry primarily about a tactical nuke and there are plenty of options Russia could walk with before tactical nukes and plenty of reasons even a tactical nuke would not be worth it.",8418b4d8f7269f30a610c1f3109fbb97317ec740,True,False,,,,,0,1651162286,,0,{},i6js1a4,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t1_i6j0nkw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6js1a4/,1651162305,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651133486.0,

Standard shells would be outranged by Russian 152mm shells. RAP rounds (rocket assisted or base bleed assisted) would be around the same range. Only Ecalibur would outrange them but they are super expensive ($112k a round, rather than $400 a round for standard shells).

However, the M777 are a lot lighter and ""tear up/tear down"" much quicker making them more mobile and survivable, and thats a decent advantage.

They are also way more accurate, especially when paired with US counter battery radar. As I have come to understand it you need ""your position, the enemy's position and the weather conditions"" to compute an accurate artillery shot.... then you need to point the gun where the calculations tell you to in direction, elevation etc.

The M777s are computerised and use US Military grade GPS (accurate to a meter) to automatically get their own position. The US counter-battery radars are also networked to them, giving them instantaneous access to very accurate enemy artillery positions, and they are also networked to weather sensors and meterological reports giving them accurate weather data.

Basically.... the computers get all that accurate data....crunch it.... and then use the results and the crew point the cannon where it needs to point using accurate electronic sensors/digital readouts on the cannon that measure its angle/height etc.

On the other side..... Russian artillery has access only to commercial GPS for its location, or worse ""a paper map"" making its own position less accurate..... Access only to russian counter battery radar, which is less accurate, for the enemies location.... Access only to manually recorded meterological data.... and when you get all that out a human has to enter it into a computer and manually compute the firing solution.... and, finally, they have to turn analog dials and use analog bubble-levels etc to setup the artillery piece in the required configuration to point it where the sums say it needs to point (which is introduces more inaccuracy).

Basically, the M777's can setup faster.... shoot quicker and more accurately due to the computerisation.... then tear down faster.... then run away from return fire faster as its lighter.

What do we really know about how demoralized Russian troops are or how depleted the average motor rifle infantry company is? 

Early on in the war, especially around the Kyiv-Sumy front, SIGINT picked up and released to the public a very limited and highly edited amount of cell phone calls that talked about poor morale. There was also some videos showing Russian POWs interrogation confessions, but in all honesty those should not be trusted as truthful. What do we have now? I seriously doubt their morale is good, but do we have specifics? More so, do we know how that's affecting operations? Are they delaying when ordering to attack? Making half heated gestures and pulling back as soon as they make contact? Are units that take ground immediately retreating after counterattacks? All those are signs of units who bad morale but I've personally not heard much about issues like those.

We know the Russians got hit very hard with casualties, and like always the infantry always catches the most by far. But we don't know specifics. Despite not knowing the breakdown or how the Russians are responding, is that what you mean by lack of infantry ability? Or are you talking about having too few dismounts as part of their overall TO&amp;E? Or do you mean a lack of skill in something specific?

In regards to the last, it's my opinion that the type of fighting happening now in the Donbas is why investing heavily in quality infantry to fight this type of war is a mistake, it's a wasted investment. 

Only in a perfect situation will really good infantry dominate the fight, but the reality is Murphy's Law is the norm, and the best can and will run into unexpected difficulties nonstop and get chewed the fuck up as a result no better than mediocre infantry. Historically that's why the US never made an effort to over train our infantry, there was no point trying to make cannon fodder elite (I say that having spent 11 years in USMC and US Army as an infantryman). 

That's why it's imperative never to force SOF to perform conventional operations (especially attacks) unless it's an emergency because it's a waste. That's panned out historically, military forces go through all that time, effort, money selecting elite troops and training them to high standard and use them in a mission that's the same as a normal grunt unit and the SOF get chewed up badly. Maybe slightly slower than normal infantry, often at the same rate, with maybe a slightly higher kill ratio's, but even that's not assured if, for example, an SOF unit advances into an unexpected minefield, gets plastered with artillery and then directly fired on by a force they weren't told was present (aka, a normal day in this type of fighting).",0425abe13afd007e43c728962b98f70c966b83d0,True,False,,,,,0,1651161906,,0,{},i6jr3lp,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t1_i6jhmh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6jr3lp/,1651161922,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651133106.0,

*Biden seeks $33 billion for Ukraine, a massive jump in funding*

https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-looks-congress-oligarchs-more-cash-help-ukraine-2022-04-28/

President Joe Biden asked Congress on Thursday for $33 billion to support Ukraine - a dramatic escalation of U.S. funding for the war against Russia - as well as new legal tools to siphon assets from Russian oligarchs.

The vast funding request includes over $20 billion for weapons, ammunition and other military assistance, as well as $8.5 billion in direct economic assistance to the government and $3 billion in humanitarian and food security aid.

""We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,"" Biden said at the White House. ""The cost of this fight - it's not cheap - but caving to aggression is going to be more costly.""

Biden is also seeking the ability to seize more money from Russian oligarchs to pay for the war effort.

His proposal would have lawmakers hand his administration new capabilities, letting U.S. officials seize more oligarchs' assets, give the cash from those seizures to Ukraine and further criminalize sanctions dodging, the White House said.

The steps include letting the Justice Department use the strict U.S. racketeering law once deployed against the mafia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, to build cases against people who evade sanctions.

Biden also wants to give prosecutors more time to build such cases by extending the statute of limitations on money laundering prosecutions to 10 years, instead of five. He would also make it a criminal act to hold money knowingly taken from corrupt dealings with Russia, according to a summary of the proposals.

The measures are part of U.S. efforts to isolate and punish Russia for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, as well as to help Kyiv recover from a war that has reduced cities to rubble and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.

The new request represents the full amount U.S. officials expect to need through September, the end of the fiscal year.

U.S. military aid to Ukraine alone has topped $3 billion since Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and remove fascists in Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.

The United States and its European allies have frozen $30 billion of assets held by wealthy individuals with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, including yachts, helicopters, real estate and art, the Biden administration has said.

Members of Congress from both parties have been supportive of efforts to boost Ukraine. The House of Representatives on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly in favor of a largely symbolic bill to urging Biden to sell off Russian frozen assets.

But Republican congressional aides said after receiving the supplemental proposal that, while they generally supported aid to Ukraine, efforts to combine it with the fresh funding Biden also wants for the COVID-19 response could make it difficult to pass.",778dc6d3bdaf90bbfcd963271d2c8cda99957db8,True,False,,,,,0,1651161170,,0,{},i6jp9v8,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t1_i6jh38p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6jp9v8/,1651161185,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651132370.0,

&amp;#x200B;

The area south of Izyum:

fierce fighting continues along the entire perimeter of the Russian bridgehead. There are tactical advances everywhere.

According to incoming reports, the most fierce battles are taking place on the right flank - in the area of ​​the village of Velikaya Kamyshevakha (and, possibly, directly in the village), as well as ""on the edge"" of the offensive - in the center of the bridgehead - in the area (possibly - and on the territory) of the village of Novaya Dmitrovka .

After taking the indicated n.p. our troops will approach directly the Barvenkovo-Slavyansk highway and create a threat of its interception (which will not be easy, since the settlements along this highway merge into an almost continuous agglomeration).

It should be noted that the battles are continuous ""viscous"" character. The enemy has enough manpower to - despite the lengthening of the front line in this area - nowhere to allow Russian troops to make deep breakthroughs.

At the same time, the enemy continues to withdraw his forces from the bridgehead he still has on the left bank of the Seversky Donets - from the Liman-Yampol region and the Severodonetsk ledge, leaving the most advanced positions to the east between Severodonetsk and Popasna (in which fierce fighting continued).

It is assumed that the enemy will soon (today or tomorrow) leave Liman and withdraw his troops to strengthen the flanks of the group - near Barvenkovo ​​and Slavyansk.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the DPR were unable to prevent this and surround the enemy units.

In general, the enemy defends competently, stubbornly, controls the situation and his troops.

There is no panic in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is absolutely clear that their command is betting on WINING TIME AND INflicting MAXIMUM LOSS ON THE STRIKING UNITS OF THE RF AF (LDNR AF) - due to the unhurried surrender of the territory.

Ahead of the Russian troops in this direction is the huge Slavic-Kramatorsk agglomeration, which was prepared in advance for a long defense.

Its Armed Forces will definitely not surrender until the last opportunity - defending, if necessary, as a ""besieged fortress"". (In this regard, the fate of the remnants of the Mariupol garrison is of great importance - they should not be released or interned in any case - otherwise the garrison of Slavyansk-Kramatorsk will defend just as long and stubbornly, if not longer and more stubbornly).

However, this ""fortress"" will still have to be surrounded, which is very difficult to do with the available limited forces and at such a low pace - at which the enemy freely withdraws his units and prepares new defense units in advance.

In the south - in the area of ​​Gulyai-Pole and Orekhov - the situation has not changed significantly. ""Southern part of ticks"" stalled.

In the central section - near Donetsk - the situation as a whole is unchanged. There is a lull in most areas, the fighting is only in the area north of Avdiivka, where the DPR Armed Forces have had minor tactical successes.

**The general conclusion, unfortunately, is bleak: the attack of the Russian group on the encirclement and encirclement of the Donetsk group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which did not come as a surprise, met with fierce resistance and almost certainly will not lead to a complete encirclement and defeat of the enemy. additional tank corps in order to abruptly break through the front and connect deep in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ""Cannes"" just didn't work out.**

**In the** ***best*** **case, the enemy will “squeeze out” from the Donbass for many weeks and even - it is possible - for several months, with heavy losses (mutual, of course). That will allow him to create, train and massively introduce strategic reserves into battle in any chosen area without much haste by the summer. And also - to crush Transnistria, gathering sufficient forces for this and not risking defeat near Donetsk during the operation.**",61b8b2fba904809c7b728380667cdda3096b0048,True,False,,,,,0,1651161115,,0,{},i6jp509,False,t3_udtbzp,False,True,t3_udtbzp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udtbzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_28_2022/i6jp509/,1651161133,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651132315.0,

The Mexican cartel situation is... a perfect example of this sort of mentality. Wish I'd thought of that.

&gt; if the nerds are the ones bringing in the money, why keep the old boss? Not nostalgia. Not loyalty.

That's exactly what the FSB fears. The Nerds are smarter than they are and will never be loyal to them, because on a fundamental level they don't deserve loyalty, and nor do the institutions built by the Russian state.

This is different from an American context where one can have loyalty to the country, it's constitution, and its institutions while absolutely opposing the party in power, attempting to preserve those institutions through a time of political idiocy.

&gt;And you look at western democracies that don't have to worry about coups coming from the military and think wouldn't this be a nicer way to live? But when they are so baked into the authoritarian mindset, how do you even change that?

If you're Russian, glorify the history of Novgorod, and decry the tryants of the past as traitors to Russia's rightful future as one of the great nations of the world.

You get the flag waving Vatniks with that sort of language, while also making a space for liberals. You teach about Novgorod in schools, and that all Russian citizens are heirs of the Novgorodian democratic tradition. And in doing so, you are building Russian democracy on Russian ideals.

This sort of thing can only come from within.

And then you professionalize your NCOs and eliminate the hazing, replacing it with actually effective military training so that you've got a real military that is also taught that they are the protectors of Russia's future.

These sort of cultural changes can move very quickly if you tap the right notes.

You commission movies and television shows about Novgorod, and the democratic heritage that is Russia's birthright, denied to the Russian people by Tyrants.

You just need to make sure everyone has food. 

You can't eat political and social reforms.

&gt;Basically abandon every ideal that makes you Nazis and it literally took burning the country down around them to make them do that.

For too long the progress made at the tail end of the Cold War has been slipping away, while risk of nuclear and conventional arms have been increasing over the last twenty years. 

The last Russian missile test that happened a few days ago shows that arms control can and does work, and the benefits to avoiding crises are immense. 

-------------

Quotes:

&gt; * Here’s the good news. The fact that Russia notified the United States in advance of the missile test is actually a powerful reminder of the importance of arms control between adversaries. 

&gt; * The bad news is that this type of arms control is now hanging by a thread between the United States and Russia, and virtually nonexistent between the United States and China.

&gt; * WHAT DID RUSSIA TEST, EXACTLY?
&gt; * Russia has been developing the multi-warhead Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for several years, claiming that it can penetrate any adversary’s defenses. Although this week’s test used only mock warheads, the missile’s ability to carry hypersonic glide vehicles has led Putin to characterize it as “unique.” And a senior Russian official described the missile as a “superweapon.”

&gt; * This week, the arms control regime worked exactly as designed. 

&gt; * This “nonevent” — the crisis that did not happen when the Russians tested a nuclear missile amid a major conventional war against U.S.-backed Ukraine — is a prime example of the continuing value of global arms control efforts.

&gt; * Arms control doesn’t require close or cordial political relations. 

&gt; *  For the United States and Russia, these elements of mutual interest have long included avoiding misinterpretations of the other’s test launches.

&gt; * Officials in Beijing have repeatedly indicated little interest in pursuing an arms control treaty. China has also been highly reticent to engage even in more limited forms of risk reduction, such as regular high-level dialogue between political leaders, or military-to-military communications in the increasingly crowded waters of the western Pacific.

You can bet I was branded a traitor before I ever knew the consequences of disagreeing, it followed me like a scarlet letter for years.

I can only imagine the professors I knew trying to do mental gymnastics to explain how the current war in Ukraine is all the fault of the evil US, and Russia is in not ultimately responsible for its actions. Surely the military aid is only one more sign of the dastardly US military machine sent to oppress innocent Russians for their assault on imperialist sympathizers in Ukraine. 

For any academic to have submitted a research paper, or even the idea of a paper, on Russian or Soviet imperialism/colonialism would have been career suicide.

A twitter thread about the blindspot in academia about Russian colonialism, and imperialism.

Russia's war on Ukraine made me think more about the importance of Russian imperialism. 

So I turned to a leading journal to understand current scholarship and debates. I was genuinely amazed by what I found🧵 1/

I looked through over 20 years (!) of titles in the Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History, and guess what? There was not a single research article written about Russia or the USSR in that whole time. 2/

There were seven review articles that mentioned Russia or the Soviet Union, but that was it.

This shows a huge blind spot in Western Engagement with Russian empire and seems staggering. There were articles from all parts of the globe (colonisers and colonised), but no Russia. 3/

No wonder many left wing types in W. Europe still fail to include Russia on their mental maps of European imperialism. 

I know there are excellent scholars working on the history of 🇷🇺 empire, but why aren't these discussions part of the broader field of Colonial studies? 4/

Maybe I'm looking in the wrong journal? Also, I gave up after looking through 20 years of titles. Who knows how many more years I would need to look through to find an article on Russian imperialism 🤷‍♂️ end/

H/t to @MaximEristavi and others who have been highlighting this issue.

There are, or course, superb platforms that do discuss Russian imperialism such as @abimperio (h/t @DrKevorkO)

The point though is that this scholarship seems divorced from discussions in the wider discipline of Colonial studies.",e04700fd412eccd3bddc0893456f3478be18a5a1,True,False,,,,,0,1651154376,,0,{},i6j8vn5,False,t3_ublttg,False,True,t3_ublttg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6j8vn5/,1651154392,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651125576.0,

&gt; [Google Translate] Today, at about 8 am, the self-liquidation of the railway bridge in Akimovka, Melitopol district, took place

&gt;According to the speaker of the Odesa OVA Bratchuk, the occupiers supplied weapons and fuel from Crimea through this bridge.

This appears to be the only railway route from Crimea to the whole Southern front between Zaporhitzia and the Donbas..... with the single exception of a long line that has to go Crimea-&gt;Kherson-&gt;**Snihurivka**&gt;Back across the dnieper at Nova Kakhova then back all the way to the east again.... this alternative line is very, very close to what appears to be the front in Kherson Oblast. Ukraine took villages around Snihurivka yesterday and are reportedly assaulting this town, putting this line well within cutting/artillery range.

Looks like rail supply to the southern Donbas front is now only really viable from the Donetsk direction. At least until they rebuild the bridge.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,[],,,,text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False,"&gt; Is it really surprising that they’re making progress in the Donbass? 

Not the original commenter but, no. Its not surprising.

By all acounts russia amassed 22 BTGS north of Izyium. Depending on previous attrition thats probably in the region of 10-15,000 troops and 150-200 tanks.

They are applyng them over a front that is a few km wide.

You'd expect that kind of concentration of force to make gains, period.

The question here is.... 

1) How much gain are they making ? (seemingly small gains and slowly. No big sweeping breakthroughs).

2) What are they losing to make those gains ? (in fairness, this is almost entirely unknown... although they have reportedly withdrawn 2 Izyium BTGs due to losses)

3) At whatever point that push grinds to a halt due to attrition/logistics can UA push it back ? (again, unknown).

Like I said in a comment a day or two ago, we will be hearing bad news for about 2 more weeks, I'd expect Ru forces to continue making gains for that long, but likely *only* 2 more weeks. 

Then we're likely to start hearing good news for about 2 weeks after that as at least some of those gains get pushed back.

Where it settles after that back and forth is anyones guess, but I'd say right now it isn't looking great for Russia. They pushed on at least 6 axis.  2 appear to have made 0 gains (Huliapole, Sverodonetsk), 2 appear to have made gains in the single km number (Popasna, Marinke), and 2 (Izyium, Kremimna) appear to have made gains in low double-digit kms.... in a week.

I also expect that after the attrition of those 4 weeks (2 weeks out, ad 2 weeks back), they'll be limited in what they can do in terms of any further offensives. 

But....no..... Making small gains in the first weeks when ammassing large forces for big offensives is not surprising at all.",ee2e4db56751ab404b862d1d18eaad9bfb835686,True,False,,,,,0,1651151998,,0,{},i6j3jxs,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6iub9e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6j3jxs/,1651152012,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651123198.0,

No. They're all just russian tanks to me, except maybe the T-90 as that does look significantly different.

But only a small part of their force are T-80's or T-90s as you can see in their casualty figures, which are tallied by people much better at tank identification than me. &lt;1% of tank casualties are T-80 command variants, circa 10% are T-80s of any description, and  about 3% are T-90s.

Yes, but I'm seeing this in every video of russian tanks I see.....with approx 1% or so being T-80 command tanks....and 2-3% or so being T-90s..... the rest don't have thermal imaging except on the gunners site and those formations are clearly not all T-90s/command tanks.

As going back to ""sensors"", they don't have any apart from good NVG from their respective eras. Which is dated to hell at this point, unless they're on of the lucky few to get the newer NVG periscopes. If you can't identify what tanks have those features, and being that you stated: 

&gt; I was thnking mainly the thermal imaging when I said ""sensors"". My understanding was that the russian tanks only had thermal imaging on the gunners sight with the possible exception of the T-90's

Tells me you don't. 

&gt; You can see the russians don't do any of this in the videos the russians share.

While Russian tactics as of what can be determined so far are objectively terrible, but if you don't know how they operate to start with or how to identify them then your *observations* on their tank tactics are unfounded and just more misinformation being spread around.",d103942b73ac8820d946fb631627773828c090dc,True,False,,,,,0,1651132503,,0,{},i6ibtoj,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6i96vi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6ibtoj/,1651132518,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651103703.0,

Just that, regardless of how many crew members they have, they aren't using very basic situational awareness/defensive tank tactics. Can just be lack of training rather than lack of manpower.

&gt;Not at all correct. The T-80 command variants as built have thermal... attached to the TC cupola. T-72B3 and T-80BVM have the Sonsa-U thermal gunsight, for which the TC has own screen, along with a thumbstick for tranversing/elevating the turret and fire controls on the T-72.

OK, so with the exception of the rare (1 in 10) command variants of the rare (seemingly 1 in 10) T-80s..... the thermal sight looks where the gun is pointed (even if the commander can see that image as well as the gunner). That was kinda my point.

Its nice that the TC can move the gun around with a thumbstick to look at stuff through the thermal sight, but they are using their thumbsticks to look at ""the arse of the tank in front"".

&gt;There is no need to rotate the turret for the gunner to independently locate targets across the frontal arc, it would do very little good since the gunner's primary sight only has a 8 degree horizontal FOV and 8x magnification. The gunner is to use his periscopes, and the TC(in the T-64, 72, 80, and 90) uses his rotating cupola to locate targets and to provide a overview of the situation.

OK, so it seems rotating the gun isn't needed to have the gunners eyes being used... although it would be useful for those thermal images and for immediate response to threats.

&gt;Again, this would mean that all the older T-72s, from T-72B 1989 and earlier, for which plenty have been destroyed have no reasonable way to fire the main gun(or the coaxial). Or that they're manned and the newest Russian tanks are using a two man crew. Probably because this twitter thread(which you didn't even bother to link) was written by someone who has no idea how Soviet-era tanks work.

Yes, I didn't link it.... because I wasn't as sure as he was they had 2 man crews. As I said at the start, the thing I took from it was them not adopting the standard tank situational awareness tactics (regardless of crew size).

None of what I said has any bearing to 2 man crews. You can see the russians don't do any of this in the videos the russians share.

QUESTION 1:  What made this parade necessary for Kim Jong Un? Why now?

QUESTION 2: In his speech, Kim Jong Un said the “trend of global military forces development” and “quickly changing types of war” requires his country to modernize rapidly. Yet, the parade didn’t seem to feature many novel capabilities. Why?

QUESTION 3: Are there any tacit messages aimed at the South Korean president-elect? What do you think the incoming South Korean administration’s takeaway will be from this parade?

QUESTION 4: Kim Jong Un says his country’s nuclear weapons cannot be limited to “preventing war” when the North’s fundamental interests are threatened, adding that they would then have a “secondary mission.” What do you think is the significance of this statement, and how can we expect the U.S., ROK and other stakeholders to react?",308dbb64773bd8e887c6e164cbef7fe5b387b4d2,True,False,,,,,0,1651126350,,0,{},i6i4dxx,True,t3_udo9k4,False,True,t3_udo9k4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udo9k4/expert_roundup_whats_the_message_behind_kim_jong/i6i4dxx/,1651126367,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651097550.0,

So the result is a barrel that actually gets hotter as the pressure of the round is giving off the same heat. Perhaps I am wrong though, I am only going on what I read elsewhere.

Brass cases absorb heat by cooling the gas. It's wasted energy, it's not actually cooling the gun. With a polymer case, that energy stays in the gas. Meaning that for the same powder load, polymer reaches a slightly higher pressure. 

In an ideal world, the entire barrel would be an insulator too and all of the powder's energy would stay in the gas.",12f0411392f0a5b9c3e1a247880606d7830c84b6,True,False,,,,,0,1651124311,,0,{},i6i1lsd,False,t3_udie9a,False,True,t1_i6h3zsn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udie9a/50_cal_lightweight_ammunition_innovation_to/i6i1lsd/,1651124321,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651095511.0,

Air assets like Tomahawks? lol

""Mech assets"" like tank and IFV and APC use cannons and ATGMs to kill tanks. Abrams uses 120mm main gun. To kill tanks the Bradley IFV uses TOW, the SHORAD Stryker uses Hellfire, and newly fielded Stryker ICV have CROW use Javelin too. Arty used to use DPICM and now has better toys. MLRS used to use smart cluster munitions with similar bomblets as DPICM and those fixed wing can drop too, on top of Mavericks and JDAMs. Apache AWT use Hellfire ATGM, as do certain drones.

Jesus Christ...US doesn't use NLAWs. SMAW were used by USMC for bunker busting. TOWs are mounted on vehicles and ours haven't been wire guided in decades. Javelins are primary AT weapon on certain vehicles and used by dismounts and aren't prioritized to attack moving targets (if you had a clue how they lock onto targets you'd know why).

Unless our enemy has an abundance of anti drone air defenses and then we're screwed if we put all our eggs in one basket. That's how the arms race works, and why you diversify weapons.

&gt;The US should carefully consider how many Javelins it needs and almost certainly will, but I think it's clear it can give more without sacrificing its security, let alone other weapon stockpiles.

Granted, it *does* represent a reduction in the organic firepower of a U.S. infantry force (one of the reasons U.S. forces are feared), but this infantry firepower is but one aspect of our combat capability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Concentrated artillery is likely enabling limited Russian advances in eastern Ukraine, though Russian forces continue to struggle to break through prepared Ukrainian defenses.  
Russian forces funneled additional reinforcements and tactical missile units into the Izyum front and made minor advances. Russian forces are likely attempting to bypass Ukrainian forces on the road to Barvinkove by advancing directly west before pivoting southwards in the coming days.  
Heavy Russian bombardment and continued assaults failed to make headway against Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol’s Azovstal plant, even as Russian forces reportedly prepared to stage a press tour in the occupied areas of the city on April 28.  
Russian forces around Kherson are likely preparing for a renewed push to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in the coming days but Ukrainian counterattacks continue to disrupt Russian operations in the area.  
Russian occupation forces continued preparations to announce the creation of a Russian proxy “Kherson People’s Republic” (KNR) amid widespread Ukrainian resistance.  
The Kremlin may be preparing to either bring Transnistria into the war in Ukraine or destabilize Moldova itself to put additional pressure on NATO.

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces attacking southeast from Izyum, west from Kreminna and Popasna, and north from Donetsk City will likely made steady but tactical gains against Ukrainian defenders.  
Russian forces will likely attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate but may conduct costly assaults on remaining Ukrainian defenders to claim a propaganda victory.  
Russian forces are likely preparing to conduct renewed offensive operations to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in the coming days.

Presumably some kind of popular movement if they're the impetus behind the change but more realistically it would look like alignment with a faction which develops independently of them in some other part of Russian society, possibly within the siloviki or the military. If they did replace putin it wouldn't be with an oligarchic regime it would more likely just be a slightly empowered oligarch class supporting a regime more favourable to their interests.

&gt; Removing Putin - were there even a path for such an action - wouldn't remove the sanctions. Giving up on Ukraine, probably inclusive of Crimea, and capitulating to the West more generally might. But that would be anathema to the siloviki, as well as to all Russian nationalists.

I 100% guarantee that Russia could today come to the negotiating table offering autonomy for donetsk/luhansk and amnesty for LPR/DPR soldiers but fully controlled by Ukraine and for Ukraine to ignore Crimea (as in, neither recognise nor invade crimea) and they'd get it it they played their hand right at the negotiating table and most of the sanctions would disappear. It might massively fan up Russian ultranationalism but if the government is able to coast out the first couple of months and restore confidence in Russian markets then working people will very quickly forget to be upset.

There are already reports of such things in Kherson and Melitopol.
&gt;...
&gt;     Chechnya is controlled by Putin's lapdog, Kadyrov. And for however much his militia is one of TikTok propaganda, he certainly won't let his personal fiefdom go down that easily. The man operates a dictatorship within a dictatorship in Chechnya.
&gt; 
&gt;     Georgia's military is too weak to launch an offensive to retake Abkhazia and South Ossetia, even with a distracted Russia. Russia would need to be fundamentally compromised as a state for Georgia to even have a hope in hell of doing this.
&gt; 
&gt;     As much as I hate Assad, the Syrian Opposition has lost; they are slowly being strangled away in the rump quasi-state they still hold. The only angle here may be Rojava/the SDF, but their main objective is the liberation of Kurdish lands, geographically limiting them in scope, plus, Turkey has permanently impacted themselves along Syria's border with Turkey (thanks to a certain US President's short-sighted move...), severely complicating the matter.

Soooo wait a second. In one part you say that Russia can't occupy Ukraine because it'll piss them off, yet later on you say Russia is successful at occupying other places. So which is it? Does the heavy hand work or not? What makes Ukraine different than Chechnya or Georgia or Syria? I know they are small, but Russia still has 3.5X the population of Ukraine, so I don't think we can just rely and say ""Well Ukraine is bigger."" Russia can still institute the same tactics they used elsewhere to subdue the population. 

&gt; You're going to drag us into World War III or, God forbid, nuclear war. These acts will serve to severely provoke Russia. Military next to Russia, fighter jets flying an inch next to Russian airspace, deploying missiles close to Russia, these all provide plausible causus belli for Russia. Heck, the last one is literally the backdrop to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Is it hypocritical? Yes. But when lives are on the line we can't wantonly toy with Russia like this.

&gt; One mistake, Russia shoots down a NATO plane, or sinks a NATO ship and we have another Gulf of Tonkin incident and we're going past a point of no return I don't think any of us can ever truly calculate the repercussions of. Trust me, I am no fan of Russia, but we need to be careful on how we escalate things: we are already doing massive indirect damage to Russia through arming Ukraine and our sanctions, but anything that is seen as fundamentally threatening the integrity of the Russian state would be a dramatic escalation. 

I don't think there is a choice at this point. There is no ""appeasement"" with Russia right now. The way Putin has approached every appeasement is to get more. So you can't appease them. And that's unfortunate. Because if you appease them, Russia will become more powerful and then you will be stuck with a stronger enemy. A stronger enemy that becomes more belligerent and more confrontational. One that will require confrontation later. 

Basically, standard deescalation techniques do not work. How do you approach the problem then?

At this point, containment seems to be the best solution. Contain the war to Ukraine. But even then, Russia may see the containment as a threat to their goals of controlling the world using violence. And that's an escalation. And that's unfortunate.

The reality is the only way this conflict starts to deescalate is Russia has to chose to deescalate. And when they do that, the USA/NATO/Ukraine respond by also deescalating. And so far, Russia has not given any indication that they will. 

So the strategies outlined above are to slowly escalate the conflict and show Russia that the USA/NATO/Ukraine will not let them win this war. In which case, Russia has to find another out. We're actually at a critical moment where Russia can chose to either to deescalate or go to full mobilization. Once Russia goes full mobilization, it'll be extremely hard for Putin to deescalate the confrontation and back down. And it seems like he's going to make that decision in the next couple of weeks. 

It's a complicated problem that we have smart people trying to figure out.

I find this unlikely. To do so would just lead Putin to use nukes on NATO countries.

I think that an interpretation of this could very well be that stocks of Javelins are part of the US ability ""...to maintain the capacity to resist force..."". And there may be other weapons that can fill the role, but these are the weapons that have been readied for that role, and to have them disappear absolutely does degrade your capabilities until they are replaced, by the same or equivalents. 

I swear I read about Taiwanese ATGMs to resist an invasion force on this subreddit. The link I sent was definitely the wrong one and I cannot remember the right one. It is a real issue in any case, the US definitely sees Javelins as part of an asymmetric strategy to defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression. You can read about that anywhere.

I also agree with the US sending Javelins to Ukraine, there is a cost but I think that it is worth it. I am simply trying to explain to people that the concerns raised by the experts are very real and not to be dismissed out of hand or without understanding the implications. 

If you can see no reason at all to think twice then you are not understanding the issue in its entirety. I have a hunch though that what you are trying to say is that the evidence and trade offs tell you that sending Javelins to Ukraine is the better choice. I agree but I can also see what CSIS is referring to.

There are always some temporarily down, waiting on parts or mechanics to fix, or permanently out of commission and crew waiting on a new one, which might take time. Even if they were all present before the war started they would quickly lose some from break downs, getting stuck in mud and abandoned, crashes or rollovers, enemy fire, etc. Some might be recoverable/fixable, others would be total losses with replacements uncertain. 

Nor would each have 8x per squad as almost no unit is ever 100% in manpower. Nor would squads ever be uniformly understrength, some squads might be full strength and some worse off than others. It's the platoon leaders to try to balance out their squads without overly upsetting cohesion, with the company commander getting involved if any one platoon is that much worse than others. 

A squad without a working APC has the possibility to stay in the rear waiting for it to be fixed or getting a replacement, riding on top of another vehicle, cross-loading into other vehicles with room inside, or being used to balance out other squads in their platoon or another in their company.

When breaking up squads because too few personnel and unrelated to other factors, IMO a Russian squad doing mech/motorized ops needs the 2x crew and of the paper strength 6x dismounts by my estimation they can get away with 4x dismounts without affecting doctrine and still having decent combat power and tactical flexibility, with the SL, machine gunner, RPG gunner/grenadier, and grenadier/senior rifleman w/ under barrel GL. Missing can be the assistant MG and assistant grenadier, as extra PKP and RPG-7 ammo can be distributed between the rest of the dismounts, and the rifleman position, which is redundant. Can it do with less? Probably can get away with the just 3x with the SL carrying the GL and limited to no spare ammo for PKP and RPG, but it'll have trouble doing just fire or manuever and can't really do fire and manuever. I don't think 3x is optimal other than emergencies, but 2x isn't really useful unless they really don't expect to dismount, which is so rare it's irresponsible to plan for in most tactical scenarios.

If they have only 2x dismounts, do they get broken up? It depends who is left. Let's say their vehicle is running perfectly with a good crew, and the 2x dismounts left are the SL and a competent PKP gunner. Fuck breaking them up, give them some extra bodies from better manned squads. But let's say that squad is undermanned because they took an AT-4 hit outside Kherson, their vehicle suffered a m-kill and was taken to the rear to get fixed, the SL and VC were evacuated as casualties, and 2x dismounts were wounded, leaving driver and 3x junior dismounts: that squad should be broken up regardless if the platoon leader wants more maneuver elements, unless some outside unit can give him replacements for his losses (harder because SL and VC have to be experienced and competent).

In terms of added maneuver elements using understrength subunits, the benefit is their doctrine and TTPs are based on paper strength 3x squads/APCs per platoon, 3x platoons per company, etc. But the downside to that is that the commander can't do doctrinal shit because the understrength units are too weak. 

Realistically, manning is always mission dependent, but in a war like this it's safer to amalgamate units to ensure that a squad is a squad, because when the chain of command gives them an assignment they're doing it assuming they're combat effective. That is especially true on the attack during maneuver warfare. You don't want to be a brigade commander committing the company you had in reserve during an emergency only to find out after it fails that it was only a slightly reinforced platoon in terms of actual strength to begin with, who can barely operate away from their vehicles because too few dismounts.",2b8aaf7b8ef04e2cd14293b4d297f7c3e982d14d,True,False,,,,,0,1651110914,,0,{},i6hbw0j,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6gyv0c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6hbw0j/,1651110930,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651082114.0,

First, ""security guarantees"" is an interesting phrase. It can mean two things. It can mean a guarantee to *defend* a third country against an attacker, in which case we call it a defense treaty. Or, it can mean a guarantee (such as in the Budapest Memorandum regarding Ukraine) not to seek to threaten a country via military or economic means - in which case we call it a security guarantee.

Second, I know of no law which requires the U.S. to maintain the ability to defend China, or maintain stockpiles of any specific weapon. There is the Taiwan Relations Act, which obligates the U.S. as:

*""that the United States shall provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character and shall maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan""*

which means that the U.S. must sell Taiwan defensive arms and maintain its own ability to project power to the area. It certainly doesn't mandate that the US maintains stockpiles of one weapon or another, nor does it say those weapons be javelins or similar. Many different weapons can fill the same role of killing tanks.

Third, your cited post doesn't support you. The article linked stresses the use of antiship missiles to destroy invading Chinese forces in the littoral, or up to 100 miles offshore. Literally nowhere is antitank missiles mentioned.

I'm sorry, man. I'm just not seeing a credible threat in the foreseeable future that the Javelin is critical to defending against - by the time one rolls around, we will likely have replaced them.

There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about 'tactical' nuclear weapons, their potential use, 'lower nuclear threshold,' etc. That's my strong impression from the kinds of questions that I've been getting. I don't claim to have all answers, but here is my take 1/ 
'
Tactical' is a misnomer, of course. Nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon. It's not the yield or the range of the delivery vehicle that counts. It's the mission. 'Tactical' normally means a weapon that is used to achieve a 'tactical' military goal 2/ 

Say, to stop an advancing tank column or to attack an aircraft carrier group. 'Strategic' would mean a weapon/mission that is intended to change the strategic outcome of a war. (It is a bit more complicated, but I hope my colleagues will forgive me) 3/ 

In that sense, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were definitely strategic, although they were rather small by today's standards. Yes, some weapons are 'better' for some missions - one would not use an ICBM to attack tank columns ... 4/ 

... and one would not try a take out an ICBM silo with a 8-kt warhead (this is the low-yield Trident warhead). But the line is rather blurry. To complicate things, some weapons are called strategic because they are covered by strategic arms reduction treaties, like New START 5/ 

Yes, Russia has nuclear weapons that 'tactical' in the New START sense. Some of them are probably fairly low-yield - @nukestrat and @mattkorda suggest that some are in the 10-kt region. And some are delivered by short-range missiles or aircraft. See thebulletin.org/premium/2022-0… 5/ 

https://thebulletin.org/premium/2022-02/nuclear-notebook-how-many-nuclear-weapons-does-russia-have-in-2022/#.YmmXCOfgeRM.twitter
The thing is, it doesn't matter. First, there are no conceivable military missions for those 'tactical' nuclear weapons in this war. There are no tank columns or aircraft carriers to attack. There is no way Russia can obtain a military advantage by using nuclear weapons 6/ 

Any use of nuclear weapons would be strategic (strictly speaking, this may not be the case in all conflicts, but it's certainly the case in this war). Either in the Hiroshima/Nagasaki sense - directly attacking cities to break the opponent or as a show of resolve to do so 7/ 

It wouldn't matter if such a strike is delivered by a (nominally 'tactical') Iskander missile or, say, by a long-range ALCM launched from a (nominally 'strategic') Tu-95MS bomber. And what certainly wouldn't matter is the weapon's yield 8/ 

The idea that a low-yield weapon is somehow easier to use probably comes from the notion that if you want to take out, say, an airfield then you might hesitate to do with a nuclear weapon if weapons in your arsenal are so powerful that they will destroy the town nearby 9/ 

But this logic assumes that there is a valid military mission there to begin with, that taking out that airfield will improve your military position. It might indeed, but probably not dramatically so. It's just one airfield. There are others 10/ 

To achieve a militarily significant result you would have to use a lot of weapons against a lot of targets. Would you want to chase each artillery battery with a nuclear warhead? This is what it might take 11/ 

Not that this scenario is entirely inconceivable, but I would think that the threshold for this kind of use of nuclear weapons is very high. One alternative would be to attack the infrastructure - command centers, transportation nodes, etc. 12/ 

But these are not, strictly speaking, 'tactical' targets and going after them would amount to attacking civilians. And it would still take a fair number of weapons (which also miss, malfunction, etc. - see recent attack on Odessa) 13/ 

Which brings me back to my point - the only way nuclear weapons could be used in this war is to kill a lot of people or to show resolve to do so 14/ 

I hope that all this means that the threshold for a use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine is truly very high. As it should be. The fact that some weapons are 'tactical' and/or have a low yield does not necessarily make them more 'usable' in the context of this war 15/ 

But that does not mean that we are out of the woods yet. A very high threshold may end up not being high enough. And there are other pathways that could bring us to a nuclear confrontation. As I said before, it will take caution, courage, and wisdom to avoid getting there 16/16",f815a4641699cd781910d52b30a411cba2c06bfb,True,False,,,,,0,1651110853,,0,{},i6hbrea,False,t3_ublttg,False,True,t3_ublttg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6hbrea/,1651110864,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651082053.0,

Hey, I can talk about this

Current big infantry AR HUD project (that you *could* be talking about) is IVAS. They've done some testing with both the Stryker and Bradley, hooking into the existing DVE blocks as well as the commander and gunner sights on both and feeding them to the infantry in the back. What I wonder is if this is just a static, stationary video, or something greater where they do some processing so that looking around the cabin lets you see the image through the armor spatially aligned with your rear view, which would make it much more ergonomic to use.

[],False,,AluminumSoldier,,,[],,,,text,t2_oy54s,False,False,"I don’t think that the use of a nuclear weapon would win the war for Putin. I think it represents a catastrophic escalation of the war that could result in any number of potential scenarios, some of them quite negative for human civilization as we know know it, to say the least. However, as Russia’s conventional forces fail to do the job, it will increasingly become the most “effective” option available to the Russians. If all your other tools won’t work or break, and you’re left with only a hammer, your problems start looking an awfully lot like nails. 


We have one case in all of human history (well, two, but identical context) in which nuclear weapons were used. Their use compelled Imperial Japan, one of the most fanatical belligerents of World War II, to surrender before an invasion of their homeland took place. It’s tough to make meaningful extrapolations from one case, but I don’t think we should underestimate the devastating power of nuclear weapons on people, cities, and morale. They dwarf the scope of everything we have seen thus far in this war. Would Ukraine surrender after their theoretical use? Would the West stop sending weapons? Would their use allow Russia to achieve victory through conventional means? I don’t know, but I can imagine a world in which Russian leadership believes the answer to all of those questions is “yes.”


I also don’t believe that the Russians will settle for a limited victory or stalemate if they can avoid it. Much of the analysis of the war suggests that Putin decided to act *now* because of a fear that Ukrainian military capabilities might obtain parity with Russia’s in the future. Delaying much longer, especially now, with the West committing to arming Ukraine much more decisively than before, will only see that parity grow. For the Ukrainians’ part, a stalemate or limited agreement would only allow the Russians to dig in and to terrorize/terraform the population of the occupied land. I believe that as long as they have the equipment, they will resist allowing the front to ossify. 


But we are deeply in the land of speculation now, and the arguments you and others have made have given me a lot to think about regarding Russia’s options and potential for escalation.

&gt; * PM Ammo is also pursuing the development of a collapsible lightweight ammo can…Coupled with the lighter ammo and links, this would achieve an overall weight savings of a fully loaded can (100 round belt) from 35 to approximately 26 lbs. 

The lightening of just one can of ammo by some nine pounds is significant. More ammo can be carried by truck, trailer, air lift and individual marines. The article goes into the math of it and has a few examples.

This polymer ammunition casing is something that seems to be getting more and more mature all the time. And the benefits seem to be manifold. 

The new US Army selection of the Sig 6.8 round could be an interesting use of the polymer as well. The bottom of the case is stainless to deal with the 80,000 pounds of pressure of the new round, and I wonder if the rest of the case that is still brass could be made out of polymer. 

One issue I have about the article is that they state that 'the polymer acts as an insulator rather than a conductor; thus it will extend the barrel life of the weapon.' If I recall the traditional brass case acts as a heat sink to absorb some of the heat in the barrel, and then wicks that heat away when it is ejected. So the result is a barrel that actually gets hotter as the pressure of the round is giving off the same heat. Perhaps I am wrong though, I am only going on what I read elsewhere. 

This is a short article but it is written and published by legit sources, and the tech involved is something that we are probably going to see in our lifetimes. I think that it in the future it will be something that we will remember back to having read years ago and will be glad we did.",6d1423bf48dfafe29b537fc539797dbb99f20c40,True,False,,,,,0,1651107291,,0,{},i6h3zsn,True,t3_udie9a,False,False,t3_udie9a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/udie9a/50_cal_lightweight_ammunition_innovation_to/i6h3zsn/,1651107301,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651078491.0,

Whether it is a likely or potential threat is irrelevant, the US has made security guarantees and it must maintain the ability to back up those security guarantees. If the US was maintaining a stockpile of X amount of them then this is the amount that was deemed necessary to satisfy its security requirements. These numbers are not pulled out of a hat.

There are US laws that say that the US must maintain the ability to defend China, and I honestly don't know if Javelins apply with the way the law is written.

It seems like a weird decision to forward deploy cruise missiles, given their 500km range is one of their most valuable features. I'm guessing they want to reduce time to target and thus AA risk to the missiles, and they perceive the increased risk of destruction on the ground as worthwhile. I also suspect it's meant as a temporary check against the new Ukrainian artillery, which should out range the Russian guns, but which should be out ranged by the Iskanders in turn. Checking a Ukrainian counterattack from Kharkiv would buy time for the paratroopers to lead an advance on Kramatorsk and thus to complete the encirclement of the JFO. 

Yet the ability to complete the encirclement by no means guarantees they can hold the entire Izyum-Donetsk arc, nor hold it for long, nor that they can effectively interdict and disrupt the Ukrainian ground lines of communication for however long they do manage to hold it. It also seriously risks having substantial numbers of their limited remaining supply of elite paratroopers cut off, either at some point along a failed advance toward Kramatorsk or possibly in the city itself if they actually do capture it.

In particular the BTG formation has these flaws:
&gt;Shortages in ready maneuver forces, especially infantry, significantly limit Russian maneuver capabilities. BTGs
cannot simultaneously mass for offensive operations and maintain flank and rear security, and they struggle to
concentrate artillery against attacks on multiple simultaneous axes.
 Command-and-control (C2) limitations require the BTG commander to concentrate mission-command and
intelligence assets to direct-fires and EW shaping efforts and strikes. These assets are employed selectively to
substitute for offensive maneuvers, are not available across the entire BTG’s battlespace and can be
overloaded by aggressive dispersion and displacement tactics.
 BTGs cannot quickly regenerate combat power without cannibalizing other units in theater or garrison. Once
teams and units are degraded by casualties, they will rapidly lose effectiveness until completely reconstituted.
In the face of a credible threat, maneuver and support assets will likely be withdrawn and conserved for future
use.",33728c5335cdfdd341116b60c9f4164756d509c8,True,False,,,,,0,1651104304,,0,{},i6gxi5f,False,t3_ud1voz,False,False,t1_i6gm19o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gxi5f/,1651104317,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651075504.0,
