Corruption, Russia is a heavily corrupt country. Some soldiers and equipment were simply on paper, most of its hardware were still a relics of the the Soviet armory. The billions Putin invested in them, were skimmed off by colonels and generals. 

Russia overwhelmingly underestimated Ukraine. The military command and Putin, genuinely believed they were going to be welcomed by the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian army would collapse immediately. 

Because of this they didn’t plan “invasion, they planned “a special military operation”. Don’t think Germany invading Poland 1939, think U.S special forces assassinating bin laden, in and out special operation. 

The original plan was to overrun Ukraine and topple zelesnky in 4 days, then replace him with a puppet. Who would completely give them all of their concessions. 

Russian army is also mostly conscripts. People that don’t want to be there. Not to mention that the Russian army has a terrible hazing tradition, called “desdovchina” that lowers morale even more. Some Russian soldiers didn’t even know they were invading Ukraine. Morale further lowered. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedovshchina

The Ukrainians army was also theoretically better trained, less corrupt and had more experience.  Ukraine had 200,000 active soldiers, more than Russia’s 150,000 invading force. Ukraine also had more than 900,000 reserve soldiers. Many of which served stints in the Donbas war. 300,000 of which are initial veterans of the battles of 2014, which gives them great combat experience.  Russia only had 20,000 or so soldiers with combat experience from Syria, mainly special forces. 

The Ukrainian army was also trained by the U.S, U.K and Canadian armed forces. Ukrainian special forces received green beret training. Many younger Ukrainian officers were sent to attend western military academies.

Zelensky was much stronger leader than Putin thought. He rallied western nations to sanction Russia to its fullest extent. Before that, they were divided. Which was what Putin expected.

Also, the last eight years the Ukrainians prepared themselves for this with the help from the West. The Russians didn't modernize shit.

""failed offensives near Kyiv, Donbass, Kharkov, Mariupol, and so on?"" A limited contingent of 20-25 thousand soldiers operated near Kyiv and he could not have guarded Kiev. Perhaps initially there was one goal, but it changed, but these forces made it possible to tie up a large grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near the capital. The ring was also gradually shrinking and I don’t really understand why it failed here. Mariupl was already taken and all that was left was to smoke out the Azov battalion. Under the Donbass there is the largest group of forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, about 100,000 soldiers, and they are now being squeezed into a ring, but this is not a quick process to minimize losses, they mainly use artillery. Again, you must understand that the strategy that Russia has chosen is not very profitable, it is to preserve the local residents as much as possible and to minimize attacks on cities (Mariupl did not storm it) Therefore, Kharkov was not stormed, since it had a huge number of local residents

For example, Until recently I was in an Anti-Tank platoon so familiar with the Javelin. We were told that Russia had developed a defence system that would blind a Jav operator if he locked onto an enemy tank. Pretty worrying stuff. The Russians even showed off the defence system on some tanks during a parade.  Have you seen any blind Ukrainian Jav operators?   So either the technology doesn’t exist, or it does and Russia cant afford to equip it on any vehicles. 

They are also using conscripts and the standards of training across the board looks pretty bad. There’s plenty of videos of Russian units getting ambushed and just doing really stupid things, like the one with the APCs that dump their troops right in the middle of the kill zone and they get gunned down.  I will say there has been a lot of these stupid moves on both sides, but you expect it from Ukraine as they have a lot of volunteer soldiers. You don’t expect it from a professional army like the Russians. 

Ontop of this, the Russian supply system apparently works the opposite way from how it works in the West. Here you get given your mission and request the equipment YOU feel you need to co gear. Your request goes up the chain, gets signed off and away you go provided it’s available. From what we have seen the Russian supply system works the other way. You get what you are given and sent off to do your mission and it seems that doesn’t work as well.  We have also seen some major supply issues. Loads of videos of Russian vehicles running out of fuel which is frankly embarrassing. It happens and supply lines get jacked up during war, But you shouldn’t have your multi million dollar main battle tanks broken down at the side of the road because they ran out of fuel.",b2da7efcbaaa7f38fbc21d8f489fc3f5d876947c,True,False,,,,,0,1651158849,,0,{},i6jjktx,False,t3_uduw7n,False,True,t3_uduw7n,/r/war/comments/uduw7n/how_is_russia_failing_to_invade_ukraine_if_they/i6jjktx/,1651158862,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651130049.0,

Now the situation in Iwo Jima was different - and MUCH more difficult as it is an island.  Mariupol was easily accessible by the Ukrainians and thus easier to modify - plus advances in machinery since 1944 are considerable.

The Alliance did not use military force to change borders in the former Yugoslavia. From 1992-1995, NATO conducted several military operations in Bosnia, including enforcing a no-fly-zone and providing air support for UN peacekeepers. These activities were mandated by the United Nations Security Council, of which Russia is a member. NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions in 1995 helped pave the way for the Dayton peace agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia that had killed over 100,000 people. From 1996 onwards, NATO led multinational peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, which included troops from Russia. The European Union took over that mission in 2004.  
The NATO-led operation in Libya in 2011 was launched under the authority of two UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), 1970 and 1973, neither of which was opposed by Russia. UNSCR 1973 authorized the international community ""to take all necessary measures"" to ""protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack"". This is what NATO did, with the political and military support of regional states and members of the Arab League.  
NATO's operation in Kosovo in 1999 followed over a year of intense diplomatic efforts by the UN and the Contact Group, of which Russia was a member, to end the conflict. The UN Security Council repeatedly branded the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and the mounting number of refugees as a threat to international peace and security. NATO's mission helped to end large-scale and sustained violations of human rights and the killing of civilians. KFOR, NATO's ongoing peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, has a UNSC mandate (UNSCR 1244) and is supported by both Belgrade and Pristina.""",77eba21267e6e8e743bc206504210fa685dfcd99,True,False,,,,,0,1651151797,,0,{},i6j34gl,False,t3_udc5qb,False,True,t1_i6iy3i1,/r/war/comments/udc5qb/russia_is_a_terrorist_country/i6j34gl/,1651151809,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651122997.0,

Freedom of speech doesn't stop anyone from saying his or her version of reality, so of course you'll get a lot of so called propaganda, but also a lot of alternative outlets that gather and express a more divergent political perspective on the current war. Corporate media, in all its flaws, is the vehicle of a multitude of different voices, giving birth to a cacophony of points of view among which you can find any possible perspective on the current conflict.


Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Russia, where all media outlets are subservient to the government and freedom of speech is a dream that cannot exist.

Missile Defense systems are pretty well known, THAAD and the SM-3. The problem is those programs. So to attempt to take out 2,000 Russian warheads warheads would only cost $24 billion, but you're probably going to want more than one shot per incoming nuke, even if you had a 90% interception rate that's still 200 dead cities in the U.S. and Europe.

So say you go with 2 missile defense missiles per warhead, that's $48 billion dollars,  you have another problem though, decoys, every single ICBM and SLBM is going to be loaded with decoys so if each of the 543 ICBM's and SLBM's contain 10 decoys, you're going to need 2 missiles for each of those decoys since there is no way to tell the difference between a real warhead and a decoy. So at $12 million per missile you're going to need about a $115 billion for just missiles, that doesn't include the sea based anti-ballistic missile equiped destroyers or ground based missile defense complexes..

Then you learn each missile will deploy miles of chaff in space to greatly reducing the ability to track something the size of a large trashcan in space moving at mach 20.

It becomes pretty difficult to have an effective nuclear missile defense system.",908c4fb041a12507495e9b9b81f2fcb5af6ce455,True,False,,,,,0,1651113888,,0,{},i6himce,False,t3_ud5i24,False,True,t1_i6g153a,/r/war/comments/ud5i24/putin_threatens_response_strikes_against_west/i6himce/,1651113903,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651085088.0,

U.S. nuclear weapons missiles (ICBM's and SLBM's) we're created in the 1970's and 1980's, we have done some slight upgrades to replace components that were hard to continue producing due to the age of the missiles.

It is highly likely that Russia and China have aquired every detail of our current weapon systems. This gives them the ability to replicate and test our command and control systems as well as our missiles to look for remotely exploitable vulnerabilities. Should they find a major flaw in those systems it could take years or possibly decades to fix those problems.

Everyone who has practical knowledge designing and building new nuclear weapons has long since retired or died. All of the lessons learned and experience gained  in the 70's and 80's is left to the documentation, much of it is going to be scanned from paper. There is no one left if you have questions about that documentation.

The brain drain in the U.S. nuclear weapons field has been pretty extreme, we[ lost the ability to produce some of the nuclear warhead components](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/05/fogbank-america-forgot-how-make-nuclear-bombs/), that is a pretty serious problem.

[],False,,McFryin,,,[],,,,text,t2_o4tog,False,False,"Nothing new there. It's just another ICBM, most of them travel at hypersonic speeds anyway. The difference would be if this missile has the ability to maneuver during flight, which would make it harder to intercept than a traditional ICBM which has a predetermined arched trajectory.  It's an MIRV (Multiple Independently Targetable Re-Entry Vehicles), which have been around since the 60's and we both have those. It can carry 15 warheads and a total yield of around 50 megatons, compared to the Minuteman III which has a max payload of 1.425 megatons.

But what does that change really? We have nuclear weapons on multiple Submarines capable of striking anywhere on the globe within 15 minutes of being given the order. We have hundreds and hundreds of ICBM silos that can be launched within 5 minutes of being given the order. We have nuclear bombers at the ready 24/7. We are still in a Launch On Warning ""LOW"" posture, which is indistinguishable from being constantly poised for a ""first strike"", and we've been in that posture since like 1959 or something. Our retaliatory strike would be in the air and on the way long before their first strike hit us, even with this new missile.

Nothing has changed, it's just a new missile. If you live in a large metropolitan area, a capitol city, an area that has a significant impact on your countries economy, an area with a lot of missile silos (ND SD MT etc) or a military base, you've had a nuclear missile aimed basically directly at you this entire time. Both the United States and Russia have had the capacity to totally annihilate each other (and the rest of the world) many times over since the 60's, but nobody has pushed the button. There're reasons for that, mostly the complete and total destruction of ones country is enough of a threat to keep ya away from that button. Also Russia has a history of using it's nuclear arsenal as a threat when it's in a conflict, and they are always bluffing, they have a policy of ""escalate to de-escalate"", and threatening nuclear weapons is like the only way they have to scare the rest of the world.

So like I said, nothing's changed, just a new missile. In the end it will all come out the same, total destruction of two countries and a large amount of land.
