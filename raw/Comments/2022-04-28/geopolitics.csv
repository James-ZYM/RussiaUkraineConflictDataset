Many of the continent’s modern territories were resultant of the carve-up the Europeans did, disrespecting the existing tribal and cultural differences in the territories. As a result, many of the African nations, upon independence, were left with little infrastructure for governance and a solid institution to rule themselves without falling into “strongman” politics.

If I look at the Sri Lankan Tamil crisis as an example of how two distinct cultural groups cannot coexist without going through some form of strife in order to facilitate in conflict resolution (basically, *might is right*) in the context of trying to figure out what a national narrative is supposed to be like after independence, the problem is maginified in Africa, where nations like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria and Mali had to fight against armed minorities whose backers are from other countries or supra-national entities that are looking to find opportunities &amp; extract concessions, often to benefit the “strongman” leaders there.

Okay. Yanukovych fled on 22 February 2014. That same night, Putin issued the orders to the Russian military. The following day, dubious ""demonstrations"" were held in Sevastopol. Five days after Yanukovych fled, the ""Little Green Men"" from Russia showed up in Crimea. 

The US certainly didn't provide huge quantities of arms and training to Yanukovych. And the time between when he fled and when the Russians invaded Ukraine the first time is too small a window for anything meaningful to have happened in that space. You seem to be trying to blame the US for Russia's actions again. 

&gt;  There is a wide spectrum between fully aligned, trade partnerships, levels of armament, foreign bases, neutrality.

You're right. There's a mutual defense pact in the Caribbean that doesn't involve America. Estonia/Latvia have been on Russia's border as NATO members for quite some time now. Russia's issue is that it sees NATO as preventing it from bullying the nations it wants to bully. Because of that, Russia feels like it must oppose NATO. 

Here's the catch-22 of European nations: they know Russia will not honor its treaty obligations and they also know that refusing to be part of a broader coalition means Russia is more likely to lean on them. Therefore, the strategic decisions available to Eastern European states are: (1) join NATO and/or the EU) or (2) become subservient to Russia. That's a raw deal and it's no wonder the EU has been continuosly expanding and incorporating even ostensibly neutral states. 

&gt; Crimea is about as important to Russia as the Panama canal to the US, it's worth fighting about and the West totally knew that. Still we played games of brinkmanship, now we denounce Russia as imperialist.

I mean, invading another country because they won't do what you want is generally an imperialist action. I have noticed a recurring trend in your post that, so I have to ask -- do you believe countries should practice imperialism? Beacuse you're arguing from imperialism in a lot of your post.

Anyway: Russia got concessions in Crimea. They would've gotten more if they had negotiated for them. But there was no time between Yanukovych fleeing and the Russian invasion for any diplomacy to happen. This wasn't brinkmanship. This was Russia losing their puppet and deciding they needed to remind Ukraine who had the bigger gun.

&gt; I agree the US can fight on two fronts, I would doubt they could win though.

I think you *massively* underestimate the staggering conventional military power the US wields. Pick any two nations. America can beat them in a straight up fight. It might not be easy or pretty, and occupation is almost certainly off the table, but a conventional victory is absolutely in the cards. The spending alone should make that obvious. 

&gt; Maybe without that unipolar doctrine and all the cold war thinking we would have more peace. Why does the US get to have national interests all around the world but no one else even gets a much smaller sphere of influence?

The US is certainly guilty of imperialism, but you don't have to look very far to find clear examples of the US engaging other nations as peers rather than states to be bullied into submission. The US suffers from a problem with oversimplifying foreign policy and always having to have a big bad evil guy to scheme against, but it's certainly a lot more even-handed than Russia is. 

&gt; No one would defend the Nazi ideas as self determination even they were exactly rooted there.

I really hate to break it to you, but Russian ultranationalism (or whatever you want to call the Siloviki) is functionally identical to fascism. 

https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html

Russia checks every box here. Feel free to dig into some of the things the Patriarch said about the current war if you're skeptical about the religious item. The rest should be self-evident.

&gt; China is constantly pressured on their internal no politics and Taiwan, where is the respect for self determination now?

I'm unsure why you're going so deep on whataboutism here, but the argument of self-determination says Taiwan should be independent. The Taiwanese are so circumspect about it because they don't want to be invaded. If they wanted to be part of China, they'd say so. 

&gt; What do you think would happen if Germany were to deviate from current NATO policy and insist on peace talks with Russia?

We've already seen Germany catch static from *European* states for being soft, for not being willing to support Ukraine when it matters, and so forth. Poland will castigate Germany if they start talking about unfavorable peace deals.

&gt; What Ukraine did was turn off the water to Crimea and send 80% of their troops to fight (mostly Russian) separatists. 

Why should Ukraine supply water to a part of their country that the Russians have annexed? They're under no obligation to do so. Just like Russia is under no obligation to sell gas to Ukraine. I understand why Russia felt pressured to seek a restoration of that water supply, but, and maybe I'm crazy on this point, it seems like expecting Ukraine to continue supplying occupied Crimea is kinda silly. And letting separatists run amok is even sillier. 

&gt; They sent the Azov batallion some consider Neonazi.

The fascist elements of the Azov battalion are problematic. Given the casualties sustained in the fighting, and that the Azov battalion was flooded with other troops after its incorporation, I seriously doubt there's very many of those fascists left. Ukraine was in an all-hands situation and took help from a group that they're probably going to purge after the war. 

&gt; If Russia was mostly concerned with the elections they would have invaded Kiev, not Crimea. I think that was a move to secure Sevastopol.

2014 was a stepping stone. Crimea secured them Sevastopol and the naval base, yes. It also secured them Russian nationals and Donetsk/Luhansk have given them an opportunity to engage in passportization, which they've already sort of pointed at in their revised war goals a few weeks back. 

Back in 2014, with very little preparation, the Russians took what they could. A full blown invasionof Kyiv was probably not in the cards.

Did you just compare a metric for an authoritarian and a democratic state? Might just applaud Saudi Arabia for no poverty I guess.

Yes, and right now the domestic policy says don't burden your populace during inflation and and don't disarm your defence when China is on the border. Hence the Foreign policy. Wonder why is it so hard to understand for people who speak English as a native language.

&gt;Multipolarity leads to global wars.

Needs citation. 

&gt;I'd rather the Pax Annihilatus continue than slide back into millions of troops fighting millions of troops.

Looks like WW2 did a number on west even when it didn't acknowledge the colonies' sacrifices. Well India will just figure out not to get involved and secure its interests which aren't too many. West need not worry. 

&gt;Have you ever listened to the Blueprint for Armageddon? You're just drafting new plans for the same buildings we've already built and demolished at least twice.

Well, we can choose different buildings each time if that's your concern. At least a poor Syrian's mud hut won't get obliterated twice. This is the goal here. 

In all seriousness you need to come out of those podcasts and see the world beyond west and iPhones. There's much more at play here. None of that Armageddon nonsense makes sense outside western hemisphere. Maybe you are too used to wars. Its time to halt them.

&gt;When it comes to geopolitics might makes right, whether that's hard or soft power.

Correct. Let's cut the morality and ethics argument right here. 

&gt;It would be Indias interests to play ball now for reciprocal ball playing later.

Wow, that's some serious engagement right there. West is in a crisis right now, India isn't. India will reciprocate later. Agree to a deal now. Sounds good? After all we did see west's cooperation during 2020 China border skirmishes. EU was discussing a trade deal with China at the same time. That is some reciprocity.

India will decide what is in its interests. West can just follow and work around them. 

&gt;but I don't see it.

You are seeing it as we speak. And you will see more as others will keep showing what is up with the global order. 

&gt;In the end a choice will be forced because the West will force it, for good or ill.

Agreed. Might is right. Let's see it. This is what we have all been asking. Let's go. 

&gt;Just look at how this operation is going for Russia. How long will they be around to partner with?

I am not in Ukraine right now so can't say much. Russian economy is coming back up. And May 9 is coming fast. As per west's first week' analysis, Zelensky would sitting in Putin's chair by now. Wonder why that didn't happen. 

I would suggest wait a few weeks before claiming a verdict. There's a lot more fog of war around.

&gt;Who will sell oil to India when they are sanctioned?

India buys &lt;1% of its need from Russia. Why is this sticking in west's eyes? Should I bring out EU numbers or do you have it already? Why is that acceptable? At this rate you should be asking head's of each German politician across the board. Why is that not int he papers?

&gt;What Nixon did with Pakistan is a shame, travesty, etc. Definitely should have sided with India there. I'm not someone who thinks the west can do no wrong, but we can't change the past.

Israelis are prosecuting Nazis and that was 1945. Bangladesh independence war was 1971. If my calculation is right we are much close to 1971 than1945. 

I wonder what exactly is the `past` here? For India it is still the present and it is likely to be the case for a forseeable future. The west may have given up on active colonialism but it still engages with countries the same way(Might is right, right?). When asked for a rightful place the country is suddenly being told of having delusions. And dangling the same wealth that they stole from those nations which made them poor in the first place. What a joke!!

West may have given up on active colonialism but it still inherits the same wealth. The same wealth that it dares to dangle in front of poor states. Those nations are not going to forget that. Every single of these headlines makes the west's `past` those countries' `present`. 

I am glad Nixon sided with Pakistan and sent a Nuclear fleet to have another nuclear holocaust. It freed up India's hands for at least a 100 years, at least. That is 2071.

In terms of further Ukrainian territorial losses, I see those taking place in the east. Russia is slowly but steadily advancing there right now. I see the rest of Luhansk falling into Russian hands, perhaps with Ukrainian troops encircled there. Encircling Ukrainian troops may not be a boon for Russia's offensive, however, and IMO it is far from clear that the Russians would possess the ability to effectively reduce and successfully invest any pocket they may create in the coming weeks. However, if Ukrainian units are cut off and destroyed piecemeal, then this could be a strategy that bears fruit for the Russians. I'm sure you'll agree with me here, but I don't see the Russians being able to seize any more significant urban centers, like Zaporozhia, Dnipro or Mykolaiv in some kind of coup de main, like they did with Kherson.

It is the west which is committing one blunder after another for past 75 years in search of that delusion. And when that dream starts shaking people are going to get rattled, evidence of which we have seen across the board for past few months of foreign dignitaries visits, the condescending headlines from blue eyed people and lets not forget those racist videos of Ukrainians treating Indian students. India has a lot on its plate. Let's stop with the sanctions' threat and move forward. India needs Russia. US will need Russia for any anti-China alliance. Just hope that there is such a scenario open in the end. Or at least let India create that scenario for you. 


The world would do much better with multi polarity. Everybody gets to bully everybody or nobody gets to do that. This is where India is going. The west is welcome to join in or keep projecting grandeur. The choice is entirely theirs.

The US should easily be doing far better than it is now considering the oath it has made to defend human rights and democracy. Just simply saying, ""Well at least our human rights is better than China""  hardly helps because China has made no oath to uphold human rights really.

""On August 1, 2018, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared an outbreak of Ebola in the country’s war-torn northeast. It was Congo’s tenth recorded outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever, but the first in an active conflict zone. Determined to avoid a repeat of the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014, when outside help was too little, too late, donors threw caution to the wind and pumped more than $700 million into northeastern Congo to fight the disease over the next 20 months. To protect their staff members, the World Health Organization and its partners put both Congolese security forces and local militia members on their payrolls. This created perverse incentives: although the combatants had reason to refrain from attacking aid workers, they also had an interest in prolonging the epidemic so they could keep profiting from it. Between August 2018 and June 2020, when the Ebola epidemic was finally declared over, some militiamen and members of the government security forces stoked violence and instability so that the disease would continue to spread and the international aid agencies would continue to pay them. A well-meaning effort to contain the disease ended up doing the exact opposite.   
This is the face of many African conflicts today. Whereas most armed groups on the continent once aimed to topple governments or secede and found new countries, those who take up arms these days are more likely to do so as a means of bargaining over resources. Some government officials in Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, and elsewhere have sought to prolong and even instigate conflicts, so long as they did not threaten their survival, and rebel groups in these and other countries have often challenged governments as a way of extracting payouts and other concessions. Although battles for state power haven’t disappeared altogether—the Ethiopian civil war is one such conflict—war in many African countries has become an economic bargaining tool, a way of life, and even a mode of governance.   
This fundamental change in the nature of conflict on the continent presents a quandary for outside actors, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations, which often partner with African governments to fight terrorism or stem migration. If some African governments are not genuinely committed to stability or, even worse, are actively fueling instability, foreign partners risk becoming complicit in the violence by supporting them without demanding better governance and accountability in return.

While this conflict has taught me to keep an, ahem, *open mind* when it comes to the extent of Russia's mismanagement of the war, I don't necessarily see Ukraine's victory lying in a straight up offensive that pushes the Russians out of their territory. With the exception of maybe Kherson, I don't see UA taking the large captured/destroyed urban centers back any time soon - unless the Russians abandon it.

But I think you hit the nail on the head when you say:

&gt;The most likely win for Ukraine here is a breakdown in Russian unit cohesion that would allow for a Grozny-1996-esque running urban battle with Russian troops, where Ukrainian infiltrators are able to isolate and pin down separate groups of Russian soldiers in a given city and force a Russian withdrawal.

This is I how I foresee the conflict becoming unsustainable for the Russians. Like I said, in the short and medium term Russia can hold on. But long term? I don't see a path that allows them to acheive their presumed objectives in Ukraine.

&gt;That’s my two sense… geopolitically over the next 5 years though, I agree with the meat of your comment. I just think that it is going to get much worse, and the Ukrainians are going to lose much more territory, first.

I wanna push back on that timeline a little. I think 5 years is far too generous here. I think we're talking 2, maybe 3 years -- if that.

Great powers attack other nations for their own interests. US has done that, Russia has done that, China will in the future.

Or Comm. China cornered as they are not able to conquer Taiwan. How nice will you feel if France burns Russia to the ground in the future with nukes because they couldn't conquer Russia, because russia resists it or because they are supplied by China.

You want to set a precedence that nuclear powered nations should be allowed to conquer anyone they wish. I can't comprehend that.

Yeah they are just threatening to use nukes creating a nuclear exchange and subsequently a nuclear winter. All because their war of conquest is thwarted by western supplies. Maybe US shouldn't have given supplies to USSR then. Or USSR shouldn't have given supplies to its ideological brethren.

They only dissolved this puppet government after they reached the less than satisfactory Moscow peace treaty.

[],False,,aiboaibo1,,,,,,"After Maidan the US started arming and training Ukrainian troops. While the memorandum only mentions economic pressure, the color revolution playbook and Victoria Nuland's influence can't really be seen as neutral.

On the other hand one could even argue that US sanctions against NordStream were economic help after the gas crisis..

I don't blame US or Russia for all the low key soft power meddling. 

I think any state sufficiently peaceful can be acceptable as security buffer. There is a wide spectrum between fully aligned, trade partnerships, levels of armament, foreign bases, neutrality. Geography matters as well, in a cold war scenario tank columns pretty much dictate warfare that follows large tracts of drivable Terrain for pincer movements, hence the Fulda Gap. Tank invasions through Finland or Austria into the Russian heartlands were fairly unlikely.

In short in my view the entire NATO expansion so far was below threshold, Russia would or could not start a war about it. While Poland has an equally long border there is still Belarus.
Ukraine is much closer and sitting on resources, industrial capacity, rivers and black sea access.

Crimea is about as important to Russia as the Panama canal to the US, it's worth fighting about and the West totally knew that. Still we played games of brinkmanship, now we denounce Russia as imperialist.

You mentioned the peacekeepers in Transnistria. These are also below a war threshold and not an occupation. Still they are a strategic asset now and are dragging Moldawia into the war. Unless peace missions are under the UN umbrella they are mostly political.. see the Coalition of the Willing, hardly a peace or humanitarian mission.
I'd rather focus on the larger war and it's sources though.

I agree in Kazakhstan, the region is fairly stable. Some independent economy, not too pro west, not too aligned with any country. Kleptocracy and autocratic but this time no one is screaming murder about it. Just saying if they suddenly became fully pro west buying US arms or a color revolution someone would probably do something about it.


I agree the US can fight on two fronts, I would doubt they could win though. At some point it's allies might ask why those wars are even necessary if they could have a multipolar world instead. Why should other countries be the kingmaker for the US and send their sons to die? Maybe without that unipolar doctrine and all the cold war thinking we would have more peace. Why does the US get to have national interests all around the world but no one else even gets a much smaller sphere of influence? Insert all the rhetorics about freedom, democracy, free trade here that Brecht already made fun of before WW2.

Self determination has limits in an aligned world. No one would defend the Nazi ideas as self determination even they were exactly rooted there. Neither does the US accept self determination in Panama or Cuba. China is constantly pressured on their internal no politics and Taiwan, where is the respect for self determination now? Where is that respect in Nuland's actions? That talk of self determination only comes up whenever it is in US interests.

The wall was because the economy failed badly. Without the block politics that prevented reunification the GDR would have ceased to exist at that point with half a million people fleeing per year. Still western Germany was only allowed to become a state with a far right government full of former Nazis because they were anti communist. SPD was spied on and strictly hand picked. Germany was and is a controlled democracy. Occupation lasted up to reunification for a reason, boots on the ground. 

What do you think would happen if Germany were to deviate from current NATO policy and insist on peace talks with Russia? I think we will soon see a lot of blame for being too soft.

The Maidan story is complicated. Of course there were both Western stooges as well as Russian ones. What Ukraine did was turn off the water to Crimea and send 80% of their troops to fight (mostly Russian) separatists. They sent the Azov batallion some consider Neonazi. If Russia was mostly concerned with the elections they would have invaded Kiev, not Crimea. I think that was a move to secure Sevastopol.
The snipers may have been instigators, not sure what the point should have been though, maybe an attempt to damage the prowestern factions. If so it backfired spectacularly if it kicked of a proxy war.

I agree with a lot you say and especially with the assessment on nukes. Using just one for shock value is not going to happen. It would be a scenario where Russia is cornered and has to finish the war or bleed out. They might target a heavy weapons delivery train at some point along with some bridge and assign blame to the West for forcing their hand. At the same time they would offer negotiation about some Djnepr border.. One of the few end games I could think of right now.

If ""American exceptionalism""is irksome, why is there a ""world domination game"" now and who else is playing? On one hand US made sure to become a superpower and talks about all-spectrum dominance, includes (putatively unarmed) space now, wages economic warfare even against allies and asks for fealty, quote ""be with us or against us"". Why is there even a NATO now that the RF is no longer a military powerhouse? I could quote a lot of Chomsky and others here. 

The days where the west was founded with Roosevelt visions and some moral high ground are long gone.

As evidenced by the lack of Javelins in ukraines most recent aid package from the US, the Americans likely are unable to send many more light infantry antitank weapons to Ukraine without endangering their own military posture. And the Ukrainian army is mostly light infantry. Furthermore, it takes nearly a year to ramp up production to 6k missiles/year (currently, it is at 1k/year). I don’t know similar figures for other types of antitank systems, but if the javelin numbers are anything to go off of, it doesn’t look great. There is a real chance here that the Ukrainians run out of antitank weapons that work best with their light infantry tactics before the Russians run out of tanks.

Instead, the Ukrainians are going to be forced to train troops on more advanced/high tech weapons and vehicle systems provided by western allies. Although there is a brighter outlook here (the US has thousands of armored vehicles that are sitting unneeded in stockpile that are still in continuous production with no worries about a shortage), it takes time to train Ukrainian crews on these systems, time Ukraine might not have. Arguably, even if the Ukrainians are supplied with more tanks and other vehicles to make up for lack of MANPADs, there is no guarantee that this will significantly shift the fight in ukraines favor- its army is a light infantry-first force, and successfully utilizing the weapons the west gives them to actually retake territory may require a systematic restructuring of Ukrainian military that the Ukrainian military is not capable of in the near future.

Overall I’m in agreement with your analysis that Russian losses are going to result in the Russian military being essentially a spent force by midsummer. In the short term, I think there’s a fair amount in your comment to push back on. Ukraine’s ability to retake territory already seized by Russia, specifically urban centers like Kherson, Mariupol and Izyum, is likely limited as long as Russian command and control stays intact… and the Russians have been working on fixing a lot of the organizational and command structure failures that plagued them in the beginning of the campaign. The most likely win for Ukraine here is a breakdown in Russian unit cohesion that would allow for a Grozny-1996-esque running urban battle with Russian troops, where Ukrainian infiltrators are able to isolate and pin down separate groups of Russian soldiers in a given city and force a Russian withdrawal. I deem this unlikely in the short term.

There’s also the question of supplies. Although the Russians are running low on missile stockpiles, the Ukrainians are running very low on antitank weapons. The US has already given nearly 1/3 of its stockpile of Javelins to Ukraine, and as evidenced by the lack of Javelins in the most recent military aid package, the U.S. probably can’t send any more. Instead, the Ukrainians will have to train troops on more high-tech weapons systems provided by western allies, which takes time and may be less impactful than we would hope. There’s a real chance on the table that Ukraine runs out of antitank weapons/the overall ability to blunt Russia’s advantage in armor before the Russians run out of tanks and other armored vehicles to throw into the fight. 

One area I think you hit spot on was the Russian losses in experienced elite troops. Although thousands of conscripts have died, thousands of kontraktniks that form the core of the Russian army’s junior officer corps are also likely dead or wounded. This is severely debilitating to any force. Furthermore, the decimation of elite units, and/or the reallocation of elite units to shore up failing offensives elsewhere (like the shifting of Russian naval infantry from an assault on Odesa to fighting in Mariupol), likely severely inhibits Russia’s ability to conduct complex combined arms operations against yet-untaken Ukrainian cities. (Not that they were ever able to successfully execute complex combined arms operations anyways).
