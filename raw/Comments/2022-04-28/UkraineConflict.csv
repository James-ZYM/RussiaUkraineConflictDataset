The US-built THAAD is supposed to fill that role but if we're being honest, it's unclear how effective it is against modern ICBMs. There are also, afaik, no installations in Europe. Just APAC and in the US.

Then there's Aegis which could theoretically kill an ICBM but it was built more as a short to medium range ballistic missile interceptor which it's arguably fairly effective at. But if the missile has split into 10+ reentry vehicles, the chances of intercepting all of them is pretty low, basically not going to happen. 

Then we finally have the Patriot missile system which, relative to THAAD and Aegis, is a short-range interceptor.

[],False,,kwagenknight,,,[],,,,text,t2_opzwo,False,False,"&gt;The bill is the latest from Congress, which is steadily churning out resolutions and resources to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and help the country and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fight back. The Biden administration announced Thursday it will seek another $30 billion from Congress in military and humanitarian aid, on top of the nearly $14 billion Congress approved last month to help Ukraine fight the war.

&gt;The measure would update the 1941 legislation Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law to help allies fight Nazi Germany. At the time, the then-U.S. president ushered the Lend-Lease Act through Congress, responding to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s appeal for aid, even as America initially remained neutral in the war, according to the U.S. National Archives.

Biden is expected to sign the bill into law, giving the administration greater leeway to send military equipment to Ukraine and neighboring allies in Eastern Europe.

“It is a real moment in history that we are back on this House floor supporting lend-lease,” said Rep. French Hill, R-Ark.

The congressman said he hoped the “Churchillian idea” would end delays in shipping aid to Ukraine, much the way the original law sped help to Britain fighting Adolf Hitler’s Germany in World War II.

“Today we find ourselves in a very similar situation with Putin systematically bombing and shelling the peaceful villages and cities of Ukraine,” he said.

&gt;Lawmakers in both parties, Republicans and Democrats, have argued that the U.S. is not moving swiftly enough to help the Ukrainians. Countless members of Congress have trekked to the region to see first-hand the devastation, meet with their counterparts in Ukraine and do what they can to offer help with resettling the flood of more than 5 million refugees.

The measure approved by the U.S. Congress would update the 1941 law specifically for the Ukrainian conflict, lifting some reimbursement requirements and allowing military equipment to leant or leased for more than five years.

While the updated legislation had backing from both parties in the House and Senate, it stalled in Congress along with other Ukraine-focused bills. Democratic lawmakers tended to defer to the president of their party to take the lead on foreign policy, especially as Biden worked to build support from allies abroad.

Then, swiftly and without fanfare, the Senate quietly approved the bill from Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, earlier this month on a voice vote without objections.",c3b3314296ec3e489efec08e087cc015a32aac58,True,False,,,,,0,1651181332,,0,{},i6l3tv0,True,t3_ue5oku,False,True,t3_ue5oku,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ue5oku/us_government_passes_military_lendlease_program/i6l3tv0/,1651181347,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1651152532.0

Sponsors may also be responsible for finding safe and appropriate housing and supporting newcomers to ensure health needs are met, kids are enrolled in school, and that employment is secured, among other factors that will ensure that the sponsored beneficiary finds safety and sanctuary here in the U.S.

While not required, sponsorship is often most successful when groups of individuals –through friends, work, faith, community or other networks – come together to pool their resources to sponsor families and share the joy and responsibilities of helping newly arrived individuals and families thrive in their new communities. There is the hope, and expectation, that groups of individuals can share resources, including financial ones, to support the beneficiary.

What exactly that means under the letter of the law is a bit ambiguous unfortunately but signing up with Welcome.US they will eventually get a hold of you and you can talk to them. It seems they are starting with helping people who have beneficiaries (Ukrainians) that need help filling out the forms and starting the process and when that slows down will start getting a hold of those that signed up on their site to sponsor that dont know anyone.

*****
&gt; WARSAW/SOFIA/KYIV, April 28 - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of lightning-fast retaliation if countries interfere in Ukraine as European leaders accused Russia of &amp;quot;Blackmail&amp;quot; over its cuts to gas supplies.

&gt; While Russia presses its military assault in eastern and southern Ukraine, its economic battle with the West threatens gas supplies to Europe and is battering the Russian economy as it struggles with the worst crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.

&gt; Sanctions are taking a heavy toll on Russia, with its economy ministry indicating in a document the economy could shrink by as much as 12.4% this year.

**Proverbs 6:12-19**

12 
A worthless person, a wicked man
goes around speaking dishonestly,
13 
winking his eyes, signaling with his feet,
and gesturing with his fingers.
14 
He always plots evil with perversity in his heart;
he stirs up trouble.
15 
Therefore calamity will strike him suddenly;
he will be shattered instantly, beyond recovery.

16 
The Lord hates six things;
in fact, seven are detestable to him:
17 
arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,
hands that shed innocent blood,
18 
a heart that plots wicked schemes,
feet eager to run to evil,
19 
a lying witness who gives false testimony,
and one who stirs up trouble among brothers.",29109bff0bb1b1278999374ad19be52e8c7929ae,True,False,,,,,0,1651173402,,0,{},i6kjoci,False,t3_udrjmi,False,True,t3_udrjmi,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/udrjmi/brief_summary_of_russian_propaganda_world_war_iii/i6kjoci/,1651173416,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1651144602.0

Because if they did, 99% of Russians would be dead before their first missile hit North America.  Whatever Russian pushes the launch button has set a 3:00 timer for a self-imposed genocide.  

Why 3:00 min?  That's how long it takes for the missiles from the U.S. Ohio subs off Russia's coasts to hit their targets.  The U.S. has 14 Ohio SSBNs, each Ohio has 24 missiles, each missile has 12 warheads each 30x more powerful that Hiroshima.  14 x 24 x 12 = 4,032 warheads.  That's enough to even cover the urt camps of reindeer herders.

I don't make this point to argue nuclear war is winnable.  In fact, the opposite.  There is no situation where Russia improves its position through a first strike.

You also can't paint with a broad brush and say none of the Russian soldiers feel guilty. I've heard interviews with American vets who gunned down what they thought were enemy combatants in Iraq only to discover they were just unarmed farmers who got lost. These dudes feel incredibly guilty about what they did, but at the time they were just following orders and trying to survive.

This invasion also reminds me a lot of the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. We were told we were going over there to stop terrorists, find WMDs and institute democracy. This how we sold this war to our citiclzens. But in reality there were no WMDs and we were really trying to secure American oil access. The Bush administration caused that war for American gain.

No, that's where you're wrong (and I've already proven that - you can look at the difference between the price per barrel of Urals oil vs the rest of the international market). Russian oil might be *influenced* by the international price, but it isn't beholden to it - they've got a lot of supply but a lot less demand, so **of course** their price is going to be lower. They need to entice those few nations who will buy their oil to actually do so in enough quantity to offset the demand that was eliminated by the sanctions.

[],False,,EvidentlyEmpirical,,,[],,,,text,t2_3wnskkvu,False,False,"&gt;The international price is set by global supply

Only when you have assets that can be sold globally. Russian oil *cannot be sold globally*. The world's biggest markets, outside China and India, will not buy their oil. European ports will not offload Russian oil. That makes Russian oil *worthless* in those nations.

&gt; if nobody is buying from Russia, guess what happens? That’s right the price goes up for everybody.

Yeah because supply is restricted. THAT SAID, it doesn't make a different for Russian oil because the customer base is restricted, they're in essence a separate commodity due to their limited customer base.

Maybe this will make more sense to you if we look at supply chains: Oil has an entire supply chain that comes along with it. From the stations pumping it out of the ground to the refineries to storage to shipping, it's not a simple or short process. Do you remember what happened during early Covid when demand crashed? Prices dropped and storage got over-full. The demand for Russian oil has crashed... but to avoid screwing their entire supply chain *again* Russia needs to sell. China and India can, therefore, dictate whatever price they want to Russia, and *Russia has to comply* because otherwise they run out of storage and their entire supply chain grinds to a screeching halt.

&gt;Where you are correct is that NATO is stronger currently in terms of nations desire to join. This was inevitable after tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border and, as far as Russia is concerned, is likely a price worth paying.

I'd believe that if they weren't threatening Finland and Sweden with ""consequences"" if they join NATO.

&gt;Firstly, NATO had to be strengthened after America ran away in the middle of the night in Afghanistan

Lies, once again - The US withdrew as per treaty, signed by Trump in February 2020. The only thing surprising about any of that was how quickly the Afghan army crumbled, but the fact that we were leaving was a matter of international law and well known.

&gt;without informing their allies

I'm *pretty sure* said allies knew about the treaty. Once again, you're just making up lies in a desperate bid to hold on to some legitimacy.

&gt;That means NATO countries are going to be be significantly weakened economically since they will be be picking up the bill even yo maintain their current defensive posture (which is poor and would be smashed by the Russians)

Bullshit - Russians are getting smashed by Ukrainians, who only have (up until very recently) NATO-issue man portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles. You're vastly overestimating Russia's ability to conduct a war... for reference, please see their GDP: it's *smaller than ITALY*. They don't have the *money* to produce or support a modern warfighting force of the size necessary to actually compete with Europe... and by all accounts they've spent &gt;70% of their cruise missiles just *trying* to take out Ukraine! Cruise missiles *they can't replace* btw, because nobody will sell them the electronics.

&gt;which will add an additional threat to its border

You're just as stupid as the Russian leadership then: NATO is a defensive alliance. Article 5 doesn't trigger if a nation initiates hostilities. Example: if Finland joins NATO, and then invades Russia, they do it on their own. NATO is, therefore, not a threat to Russia unless Russia is seeking to initiate military action.

&gt;The rest of your point are naive propaganda talking points. Wake up.

LOL suuuuuure, says the guy parroting Kremlin talking points while conveniently ignoring the fact that *Nations who are winning don't need to threaten others with nukes*. Oh, maybe you didn't know: [Russia threatened to nuke your own country just yesterday](https://www.google.com/search?q=russia+threatens+UK+nukes)...  oh wait, I think I know what's going on!  You don't actually know what winning looks like!!  Hmmm... good example...  OH! I know - 2003 invasion of Iraq: The US found Russian GPS jammers out and about in Iraq. Did we threaten Russia? Nope, just carried on with the mission, because *we were winning*. Or maybe the time when US forces [wiped out a Russian advance on their position in Somalia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html) (and before you say ""those were just mercenaries"", they're state sponsored mercenaries - they're a state military force under a different name)? We didn't threaten Russia, just let them stew in the embarrassment of their defeat and carried on...  because 200-300 dead enemy combatants vs. 40 US ground troops and their combined arms counter-attack speaks for itself.

Maybe you'd respond better to a [pop culture reference instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sJY7BTIuPY) - Any man who must say ""we're winning, we're winning!

The international price is set by global supply, if nobody is buying from Russia, guess what happens? That’s right the price goes up for everybody. How are you too dumb to understand this? This actually works out better for Russia because (assuming that there are at least some customers which there always will be) they make more money and hang onto more of their gas - in the same way the Saudis are doing with their oil at higher prices. Can’t you read your own posts and put two and two together?

Where you are correct is that NATO is stronger currently in terms of nations desire to join. This was inevitable after tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border and, as far as Russia is concerned, is likely a price worth paying.

Firstly, NATO had to be strengthened after America ran away in the middle of the night in Afghanistan without informing their allies (and causing their emergency withdrawal) - a lot of nations were asking what the point of NATO was.

Now, however, it’s clear that america is going to pivot to Asia to confront China. That means NATO countries are going to be be significantly weakened economically since they will be be picking up the bill even yo maintain their current defensive posture (which is poor and would be smashed by the Russians). Therefore, as far as Russia is concerned, there will be no increased military threat but significant costs to hostile countries.

The main issue that will concern the Tussians is accession of new countries - eg Finland and  Sweden - which will add an additional threat to its border but we have yet to see how that will play out.

The rest of your point are naive propaganda talking points.

&gt; Since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, the country has faced an unprecedented barrage of hacking activity.

&gt; DDoS attacks make up the bulk of the action, but researchers have spotted ransomware that&amp;#039;s designed to target Russia and have been hunting for bugs in Russian systems, which could lead to more sophisticated attacks.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is very rare to see the ransomware that targets Russia specifically,&amp;quot; Finkelstein says, adding that Check Point is working on new research that shows how Russia has been targeted throughout the war.

In its place, a memorial dedicated to veterans of the War in Donbas was planned.\[6\]\[7\] The Director of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance Volodymyr Viatrovych stated in February 2018, that ""a sculptural group"" of the monument should be removed according to the decommunization laws.\[8\]  
  
For the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, the arch was temporarily painted as a rainbow and renamed the Arch of Diversity. It doubled as the symbol of the Kyiv Pride parade, and was illuminated as a rainbow at night.\[9\]\[10\]  
  
In 2018, human rights activists put a temporary sticker on the arch that looked like a crack. This was a sign of support for political prisoners who are illegally detained in Russia and annexed Crimea. According to the organizers, the action aims to draw attention to the fate of Ukrainian citizens, as well as to urge everyone to make as much effort as possible to free political prisoners in Russia.\[11\]  
  
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 25 April 2022, mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, announced the dismantling of the sculptural part of the monument as having lost its ideological meaning.\[12\] The next day, during the dismantling of a bronze sculptural group, the head of a figure symbolizing a Russian fell off.\[13\]\[14\] The second sculptural composition made of red granite will be taken apart later. The arch itself is planned to be renamed and highlighted with the color of the Ukrainian flag.\[15\] Klitschko proposed to the Kyiv City Council to rename the arch of the People's Friendship Arch into the Arch of Freedom of the Ukrainian People (Ukrainian: Арку свободи українського народу).\[2\] One of the designers of the monument, Serhiy Myrhorodsky, agreed with the dismantling of the monument.\[1\]  
  
The People's Friendship Arch was one of 60 monuments that the Kyiv City Council planned (in April 2022) to remove.\[16\]
