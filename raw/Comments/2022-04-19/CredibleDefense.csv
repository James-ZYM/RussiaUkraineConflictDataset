Boeing and the U.S. Air Force have agreed on a plan to fix the KC-46 Pegasus air refueling tanker's Remote Vision System, which has been experiencing technical difficulties for years. The Remote Vision System will be replaced by an upgraded version, RVS 2.0, starting in 2024. Under the fixed price contract for the KC-46 Pegasus, Boeing is responsible for cost overruns. Boeing has already paid $5.4 billion out of its own pocket for cost overruns related to the KC-46 Pegasus program.

""Under certain lighting conditions, the imagery captured by the original RVS can be distorted or difficult to see, running the risk of the boom accidentally scraping the receiving aircraft. This problem was deemed a category I deficiency, or one of the most serious issues remaining with the aircraft.""

The RVS is a fundamentally different system than the one used in the legacy KC-10A Extenders and KC-135 Stratotankers. In these legacy tankers, the boom operator supervises the refueling operation through a glass window looking at the boom and the aircraft being refueled. The KC-46 Pegasus' Remote Vision System is a technologically advanced system that replaces the glass window by high definition screens feeding the boom operator images taken by cameras on the back of the aircraft.",d514f02b51dcd86c929348d2912fed5826277871,True,False,,,,,0,1650412769,,0,{},i5ey7zm,True,t3_u7j07m,False,True,t3_u7j07m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7j07m/us_air_force_boeing_lock_down_design_for_kc46/i5ey7zm/,1650412783,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650383969.0,

&gt; Intentions are notoriously difficult to assess, so to illuminate those intentions, Doshi looks for evidence of grand strategy in authoritative texts, national security institutions, and state behavior. Doshi offers a notable emphasis on primary Chinese sources, and he supplements these with detailed case studies, each involving hypothesis testing and consideration of alternative explanations for PRC behavior. 

&gt; Doshi argues that two variables -the power gap between a rising power and established hegemonies and the threat that the rising power perceives from the hegemonies-intersect to determine the rising power’s strategy.

&gt; …after the normalization of relations, China accommodated the United States; after the fall of the Soviet Union, Beijing perceived a greater threat from Washington and thus moved to a blunting strategy; and after the 2008 financial crisis demonstrated US weakness, China moved to building its own order and institutions. Now it is beginning to shift to dominance and global expansion. 

&gt; Militarily, Doshi finds authoritative Chinese texts concerned about the striking similarity of China’s force structure to that of now defeated Iraq and urging investment in *shashoujian* (assassin’s mace) capabilities. These include a strong focus on anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities as opposed to power-projection capabilities. 

&gt; Doshi correctly notes that a PRC aircraft carrier would have limited deterrent value against the US; instead, as Chinese scholars note, it would be more useful for coercing certain “trouble-making countries”. As Doshi stresses, China’s desire to avoid a countervailing coalition forming against it is predicated on not projecting a threatening image…. Despite this positive spin, no one is buying it. …and they are clearly seen as a tool of dominance.",f2ef72b2a7bee514a00d2737ec8ffbe9e2bd837d,True,False,,,,,0,1650412454,,0,{},i5exi5s,True,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5exdqc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5exi5s/,1650412467,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650383654.0,

Or, they could just... not? Here's the thing, threatening is easy for Russia. They threaten somebody, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But ultimately, if their borders are secure (they are, and will be), whether anybody takes their threats seriously doesn't really matter - the threat is their only real option for force projection after this, and ultimately it just means they'll get their way less. Because actually nuking anyone would *guarantee* they're fucked in every way imaginable short of war, probably by the whole world, which will devastate their ability to redevelop conventional forces and regain a credible threat. So, if they nuke Ukraine they'll have to be ready to keep nuking in perpetuity, because their military isn't coming back. 


&gt;And they can't exactly nuke a NATO country, which leaves... Ukraine. Where better to make a show of force that you're pretty sure won't bring down the whole house?

There are actually two processes that work against Russians, that you can see in census data:

* many minorities have a lot higher fertility rates than native Russians (that was true even in Soviet times)
* since fall of the Soviet Union, native Russians generally move to Russian cities, abandoning both provincial villages and minority regions

This grinds my gears immensely. In what backwards-ass universe does the US/UK not want the Russian military destroyed NOW and Putin deposed NOW???

The idea that they are somehow ""holding back"" is frankly ludicrous. The longer this goes on, the greater the economic damage to Western democracies, meaning current leaders could get voted out. The longer is goes on, the more likely people like LePen or Orban get voted in, cracks appear in the sanctions regime, etc. And a longer war means rising reconstruction costs for Ukraine.

Let me explain where this idiotic ""the West wants to drag it out"" theory comes from. It is nothing more than a flavor of the ""Ukraine should surrender now to get it over with"" crowd. Some people aren't quite gutless enough to draw that conclusion, but are still searching in their typical edgelord fashion for a way to make the West's military assistance look morally compromised.

After maidan revolution, pro Russians, imo led by Russian agents, revolted in eastern/south Ukraine. When conflict started, Ukraine military and police were unable, unwilling to do anything about it. President wasn't elected, so she didn't have much power. That allowed rebels to take decent amount of territory (Slovyansk, Mariupol for example I remember being taken).

Who fought them were civilians pissed off about pro-russian separatists (how Azov and other battalions were born iirc). Armed themselves and started fighting. When Poroshenko got elected, he was all about taking lost land. Separatists didn't have much chance against UA, some disguised spetsnaz and mysterious lost equipment from Russia were not enough. 

Russia moved in without any hiding, slapped Ukraine and made them sign Minsk agreement. Neither separatists, nor Ukraine were happy about it. Unlike Russians claim, Ukraine were actually staying off offensive and didn't attack them, but I think were preparing to do it at some point.

It's a false dichotomy. They either are having a good time, or they plan to invade Taiwan. It's a poor argument.

Then there are the factual things. For one, there is no craft of the PLAAF at ROC airspace let alone combat craft. As I have demonstrated earlier, you don't even have a rudimentary understanding of cross-strait relationships yet decided yourself expert enough to make grand claims. The PLAAF crosses international airspace which ROCAF designate as their AIDZ. That is not their air space.

The SCS islands bases are very far from Taiwan. This isn't to say that air crafts won't be coming out of these bases in a cross-strait conflict, you just have to demonstrate why China would do that when there are countless bases in China that are closer. 

As for thousands of missiles on the coast, it's just like the US is having a good time sailing up and down the Chinese coast a hundred km out, the Chinese are fine placing missiles in their border and having a good time.

The Red Cross' book on [Customary International Humanitarian Law](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf) goes into some detail on the subject in chapter 33.

&gt; Additional Protocol I defines a mercenary as a person who:

&gt; a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict,

&gt; b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;

&gt; c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;

&gt; d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict not a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict,

&gt; e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict, and

&gt; f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.

&gt; This definition is very restrictive because it requires that all six conditions be cumulatively fulfilled. In addition, the definition requires evidence that a person accused of being a mercenary is ""motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain"" and is promised ""material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combantants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces"".

&gt; ...

&gt; Lastly, it should be recalled that members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict who are not nationals of that party and who do not fulfill all six conditions of the definition of a mercenary in Article 47 or Additional Protocol I are entitled to prisoner-of-war status. It is important to note in this respect that nationality is not a condition for prisoner-of-war status according to long-standing practice and to Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention.",4e2d12deff652eb2b0b85d5f523db241a1e6a3b3,True,False,,,,,0,1650401947,,0,{},i5e80ls,False,t3_u73gmx,False,True,t1_i5c50pk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u73gmx/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_19_2022/i5e80ls/,1650401964,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650373147.0,

An example of this was only sending military personnel that had specifically volunteered to fight in the rebelling regions. 

now that Russia has invaded those limits would be off. If for whatever reason Russia gave up on the Donbass offensive like they did with Kyiv then I think that the UA military would move into the area and fight the separatists like they would the Russian military.

The sepratists had been getting much support from the russian militaru and we have seen the lackluster equipment that some of their soldiers get / get used as cannon fodder so we could assume what kind of resistance theyre capable of.

Although I do think that it is a good idea to plan and think about all possibilities. I also think that seriously planning for and preparing for limited uses of nuclear weapons is inherently destabilizing as it can make the psychological barrier to using nuclear weapons that much lower.

This collection of documents is from the National Security Archive, a non profit. Which is different from and not related to the National Security Agency. Just to be clear.

---------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Archive

The National Security Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-governmental, non-profit research and archival institution located on the campus of the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1985 to check rising government secrecy, the National Security Archive is an investigative journalism center, open government advocate, international affairs research institute, and the largest repository of declassified U.S. documents outside the federal government.[1] The National Security Archive has spurred the declassification of more than 10 million pages of government documents by being the leading non-profit user of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), filing a total of more than 50,000 FOIA and declassification requests in its over 30 years of history.

-------------

&gt; When Jimmy Carter became president in January 1977, he inherited nuclear weapons targeting policies from his predecessors, who had sought ways to give U.S. presidents alternatives to the terrifyingly massive and rigid pre-planned options of the Single Integrated Operational Plan [SIOP]. 

---------

&gt; Presidential Directive 59 (PD-59)... aimed at giving U.S. Presidents more flexibility in planning for and executing a nuclear war

---------------

&gt; A key element of PD-59 was to use high-tech intelligence to find nuclear weapons targets in battlefield situations, strike the targets, and then assess the damage-a ""look-shoot-look"" capability.

------------

&gt; Highly classified for years, PD 59 was signed during a period of heightened Cold War tensions owing to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, greater instability in the Middle East, and earlier strains over China policy, human rights, the Horn of Africa, and Euromissiles.

-------------

&gt; The drafters of PD 59 accepted controversial ideas that the Soviets had a concept of victory in nuclear war and already had limited nuclear options. Marshall Shulman, the Secretary of State's top adviser on Soviet affairs, had not seen PD-59 but questioned these ideas in a memorandum to Secretary Muskie: ""We may be placing more weight on the Soviet [military] literature than is warranted."" If the Soviets perused U.S. military writing, it could ""easily convince them that we have such options and such beliefs."" Post-Cold War studies suggest that Shulman was correct because the Soviet leadership realized that neither side could win a nuclear war and had little confidence in the Soviet Union's ability to survive a nuclear conflict.

----------

&gt; The architects of PD-59 envisioned the possibility of protracted nuclear war that avoided escalation to all-out conflict. According to Odom's memorandum, ""rapid escalation"" was not likely because national leaders would realize how ""vulnerable we are and how scarce our nuclear weapons are."" They would not want to ""waste"" them on non-military targets and ""days and weeks will pass as we try to locate worthy targets.""

-----------

&gt; The press coverage cited ""shudders"" among former government officials such as Herbert Scoville who worried that the search for ""less fearsome options for using nuclear weapons would reduce the inhibitions for employing them."" Moreover, Federation of American Scientists Director Jeremy Stone asked ""Who would be there to turn off the war if we nuked Soviet command centers?""",5007e257038ed1b99250f1367b23977b0cac81e6,True,False,,,,,0,1650400041,,0,{},i5e2x06,True,t3_u7e36l,False,True,t3_u7e36l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7e36l/controversial_nuclear_targeting_directive_pd59_of/i5e2x06/,1650400055,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650371241.0,

One of the articles I read said they were intended to fight near rail-heads so intentionally can only self supply for a few days (6?) of operations before needing resupply.

This article (5 years old): https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2017/spring/2Fiore17.pdf mentions that (logistics) as being one of the points of weakness for BTG's that should be exploited by opponents.

Suppose you are planning a defensive campaign (in this case Ukraine) and you are certain that a town of yours (Mariupol) will become surrounded. You are interested in keeping a force there to tie down enemies, although you have little to no hope of rescuing these troops.

How many troops should you leave behind?

And I am interested if anyone has done any kind of generalized analysis for this and what are the conclusions (theoretical)?

Putting it simply, in the short term, the more men you leave behind, the more the enemy has to use to contain them. However more men will eat more foot, need more water, more supplies, more ammunition, and when eventually broken - mean more POWs.

If you leave too little, the defense just collapses too quickly and is unable to pose a sufficient resistance to tie down enemy forces.

So by looking at the two extremes (leave ""everyone"" behind and leave ""no-one"" behind), it is clear that the optimal number is somewhere in between.

Is there any theory about this?

I understand it is probably too wide of a question with a lot of ""it depends"". Optimally you would want to defend a city with ""a platoon for a house, a company for a quarter"". But that only holds for situations where you can maintain and supply these troops and not become surrounded.

It depends on how much manpower and equipment do you have available in general, how strategically important the town is, how long do you need to maintain a control over it, or how long do you need to keep it contested etc.

Thankfully the bulk of the world's militaries are unlikely to do such, but it's a contingency that still certainly is on the table thinking wise.

A point on technology: use of chemical agents in WW1 isn't a complete model for modern weapons. In particular nerve agents in the Sarin family can blanket an area without much risk of it blowing back into friendly forces.

Bioweapons are only useful to militaries so much as they're predictable and controllable. This is why most of the conspiracy theory pandemic X is secretly a bioweapon stuff is such transparent nonsense. We already know very potent bio weapons that have much more ideal properties for military use: anthrax spores.

Again, the bulk of the world has decided that bio weapons are a step too far. Most have drawn down inventories and re-oriented remaining research on defensive measures.

That said, it remains a disturbing possibility that an organization with relatively modest resources might gain access to these weapons, with less inhibition to use them. The Aum cult in Japan proved that a group with a few million in the bank and enough determination could make a basic version of Sarin.

What makes this situation even more dangerous is that using tactical nukes on certain railroad and highway junctions would likely help stem the flow of weapons into Ukraine from Poland, in a way that is basically impossible to replicate with conventional bombs.  


So now we have the motive: stop the Javelin shipments and turn the tide, the means:  low yield nukes on the Western border, which also conveniently far enough that it doesn't risk radiation reaching Russia proper and the opportunity: Russia has been escalating use of cruise missiles and strategic bombers in the Western Ukraine so they can likely get few nukes through.  


We even have historical precedent - McArthur in Korea wanted to respond to Chinese intervention by nuking their staging areas and cities close to N.Korea border... thankfully Truman had the presence of mind to reject that option.

Operationally, what happens if the major supply hubs, roads, rail stations and lines in Western Ukraine leading from Lyiv eastwards get hit with persistent nerve agents?

Same here... I think we have this interesting blind spot in the West, in that we consider certain things unthinkable or uncomfortable to think about, and so we decide to ignore them rather than actually consider the possibilities, no matter how frightening they are.   


I didn't think Russia will go for full scale invasion, and fwiw I still think that was a terrible miscalculation by Putin. But he said more or less explicitly that he will in the December 2021 ultimatum, we ignored him and called it a bluff and he did it.  


Now Russia's main problem in Ukraine is western arm shipments. Take away Javelins and the outcome of the Russian initial push is maybe different. Few days ago Russia formally protested these shipments and said continuing would lead to ""unpredictable consequences"". What if Putin is actually considering the unthinkable? Since most of the shipments come through Poland, few low yield tactical nukes at key junctions and railroads would 90%+ prevent any future shipments. Remember that McArthur actually called for something very similar back in Korea so it's not completely in a real of fantasy.   


How do we estimate the chances of that happening? What is too risky?

Unfortunately,  since a settlement wasn't reached, both sides simply chose to try their luck on this next round and return to the negotiation table after that's done.  

Realistically, for Ukraine that was probably the better option, since if they loose this campaign they can still settle for what was on the table back then, giving up the donbass for an end to the war. 

For Russia, winning this campaign is their only viable (although not guaranteed) way to get kyiv to give up the donbass.

From what I saw, they didn't follow their doctrine. They didn't mass, they didn't rely on fires, they didn't follow proper march formations, they didn't do combined arms, they didn't do basically anything. Etc. And it's not surprising, they were told the Ukrainians wouldn't resist, which means it was just an uncontested drive to various objectives and then the war is over. 

The issue then wasn't bypassing heavy resistance it was that they didn't have a plan at all to deal with resistance from the platoon to CAA level. It just wasn't really a factor in their strategic plan because some moron decided the Ukrainians wouldn't fight and framed the whole plan on that premise. 

&gt;Which is where I am claiming the similarity with their original strategy, especially in the North.

They didn't create breakthroughs in the north since the Ukrainians didn't resist at the borders. They fired a bit of artillery or dropped a few bombs on the outposts and guard posts on the border and then drove in heading to strategic objectives, namely Ukraine city center. 

At that point they were basically doing a pursuit. And it's doctrine to everyone to avoid resistance. However the issue was they hadn't actually made a breakthrough, the Ukrainians hadn't even started their defense yet let alone committed their reserve, which is one prerequisite for any successful breakthrough, the enemy reserve can't respond. So the Russian advance was done haphazardly, with very lackadaisical security because they didn't know where the Ukrainians were, didn't have a plan to find them, weren't trying to do movements to contact, were just out for a drive. 

Now compare that to now and they're doing a bread and butter attack against fixed defenses. Starts out with a massive artillery strike immediately followed by armored attacks that achieve breakthroughs at outpost lines and probably the first and maybe second lines of the Ukrainian MLR and are now pushing deeper. They pretty much know the Ukraine OOB from intel, or at least as good as they're capable. They have forces set up to conduct the breakthrough, others for exploitation, they're following their various mathematical formulas for how many units and how much fires for each objective. They'd spent the last month prepping supplies. They'll have gotten their comms situation as fixed as it can get without everyone having digital radios. Command and control actually knows what they're doing.

1.) Russia takes over all of Ukraine -- this was the initial goal and clearly failed.

2.) Russia forces Ukraine to surrender and de-militarize -- this was the second goal and seems very unlikely to happen.

3.) Russia cripples Ukraine by landlocking it and taking as much territory as it can -- this is still in the realm of possibility, but seems unlikely.

4.) Russia gets a land bridge linking Russia, Donbass, and Crimea -- this is where we are now and seems fairly likely.

5.) Russia is pushed back to its initial holdings in Donbass and Crimea -- this is at least theoretically possible and would take us back to where the lines were at the start of the conflict.

6.) Ukraine liberates at least Donbass and possibly Crimea.

For one thing, it's one of the only options open to an artillery-first military with low morale and coordination. But it is also quite intentional and meant to serve several strategic purposes: to impose immediate costs in wounded and displaced persons, lost infrastructure and emergency services. To impose increasing long-term costs to affect the bargaining landscape. To put pressure on the defending forces to act. And to simply kill your enemies.

Chemical weapons might be a poor tool against a well trained, well equipped, military but they are well suited to those other purposes.

So I would hazard that chemical weapon use only makes sense for Russia if desperation does reach a boiling point *while* there were still population centres within reach against which it hoped violence would accomplish those things.

But that combination seems unlikely. The most likely cause of true desperation I can see is if controlled territory looks like it might end up at a pre-war state. Whether 2022 or, more severely, 2014. In that case, there wouldn't be suitable Ukrainian population centres to target.

Conceivably, I suppose, if the perception in Russia was that the repercussions from the outside world *literally* couldn't get any worse, then perhaps desperation might lead to chemical weapon use on the battlefield for whatever good it might do.

Either way, I think that this ignores two things

1. Tanks typically don't operate alone in offensive operations, and will engage in mutually supportive fire if one of them comes under attack (somewhat lessening the burden of patrolling on infantry support)

We've also seen Spetsnaz operations go horribly awry in the past and a lack of operation nuance that suggests inferior training to western standards.   Although we've seen special forces claims from Russia and wild assessments from some analysts, high-quality Russian SFOs might be much fewer in number and much less well-equipped as claimed.  We've seen that before with tanks, planes, IFVs, Missiles, etc.. from Russia.  Russia builds a few examples, claims parity, and then never builds sufficient quantity to be useful. There might be a couple dozen SFOs in Russia of high quality, but they seem to be inferior to NATO ones.

Since agriculture has been industrialized, halting its importation of petroleum from the Middle East would significantly impact crop yields. Probably THE most vulnerable agricultural import China has. 56% of those imports come from OPEC.

&gt; As a relatively land-scarce country (per capita arable land is less than one-fifth of that in the United States), during the first decade following its WTO accession, land-intensive bulk commodities, such as soybeans, sorghum, and cotton drove China’s agricultural imports. China has been producing most of the meat it consumes, and this dietary change has drawn more of the country’s land into feed production. However, domestic feed supplies have been unable to keep up with soaring demand, and imports of soybeans and other feed ingredients expanded rapidly.

&gt; In contrast, imports of consumer-oriented products continued expanding, led by meat, dairy, and horticultural products. Rising demand, slow growth in domestic supply, and growing costs of feed, labor, and land are pushing domestic meat and dairy prices higher, which makes imported meats more competitive in China.3 More recently, ASF has disrupted the domestic pork supply and led to price increases in all types of animal proteins and an overall sharp rise in food prices in 2019, further fueling protein imports. China is the world’s largest pork market with imports of $6.4 billion in 2019. The EU and the United States are the top suppliers, with market share of 63 percent and 16 percent in trade value, respectively.

&gt; President Xi Jinping has made food security a priority for the world’s second-biggest economy, an effort to meet the soaring demand that’s pushed imports of corn, soybeans and wheat to record levels, making Beijing increasingly vulnerable to trade tensions and supply shocks. At the same time, climate change-induced disasters have caused widespread crop damage and shrunk the amount of arable land, making it harder to boost local production.

&gt;Over the past several decades, China’s grain consumption has more than tripled from 125 million metric tons (tonnes, t) in 1975 to 420 million tonnes in 2018.1 Considerable investments in agriculture have enabled China’s farmers to produce high volumes of staple crops, allowing the country to achieve a roughly one-to-one ratio of production and consumption of grains. India has achieved a similar one-to-one ratio of grain production and consumption, but it has also positioned itself as the world’s leading exporter of rice. In 2018-2019, India exported nearly 9.8 million tonnes of rice – roughly 22.5 percent of the global total. China by comparison was the sixth-largest exporter over the same period, accounting for just 6.3 percent of global exports.

In regards to imports

&gt;With regard to meat products, China has witnessed an astronomical increase in consumption. In 1975, China consumed a mere 7 million tonnes of meat.2 That figure had grown to 86.5 million tonnes by 2018, making it the largest meat consumer in the world At 55.2 million tonnes consumed, pork was China’s top meat source in 2018 by a wide margin. On a per capita basis, China consumed 48.9 kilograms (kg) of meat per person in 2018 – roughly half as much as the US (99 kg per capita) and Australia (93 kg), but slightly higher than Japan (43 kg).

&gt;China has become increasingly reliant on imports to account for changing consumption habits. Between 2003 and 2017, China’s food imports grew from just $14 billion to $104.6 billion. While food exports nearly tripled from $20.2 billion to $59.6 billion over the same period, China increasingly finds itself running a food trade deficit.

Most of the imports are for meat products.

I do not expect the Russians to be able to make much forward progress at all, but even if they nominally control territory from Izyum to Kramatosk down south to their current front around Donestk, that does not translate into actually cutting the JFO off if supplies can still get through.

There is also some possibility that the current Ukrainian salient from Kharikiv may soon reach striking distance of the Russian GLOCs supplying Izyum via Kuplyansk, which is something of a bottleneck for roads and railways from Russia leading to Izyum. Per ISW, the Ukrainians are currently something like 45km away from there, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that they may soon be able to interdict supplies and reinforcements to the massed Russian troops there. And there are less well substantiated reports of fighting around Starovirivka, which is only 17km from Kuplyansk, so it may be even sooner than expected. In any case, Russia will need to reallocate troops to protect that flank, which will detract from their already questionable ability to make progress from Izyum.

I suspect the Russians chose not to pull units back for reconstitution and instead moved them to Izyum primarily to make it seem like the center of gravity for their offensive when in fact they plan on letting those troops more or less hang out there shelling whatever Ukrainians they can and attracting attention. Their ""real"" push will be along a number of small salients from ""unexpected"" parts of the front, such as Kreminna or Horlivka. There will be a series of probes and feints to try to find weak spots in the Ukrainian lines all along the front, then a quick hard push along whatever opportunities for breakthrough present themselves. I think that's what we've seen with the attacks on Kreminna, Rubizhne, Marinka, and Popasna yesterday. The sudden arrival of Russian tanks in Zarichne likely represents an example of one such probe via the Kreminna breakthrough.

I expect we will see the Ukrainians cutting off and destroying some of these salients. Possibly all. Meanwhile, they will be maneuvering to cut off the extremely large group of demoralized, battered units in Izyum, possibly prompting a mass surrender that would be absolutely devastating for the Russians. Possibly a knockout blow. I don't think that is likely but even interdicting supplies enough to force a withdrawal would be a huge win.

It all comes down to whether the Ukrainians can be approximately as effective on the offensive as they have been on the defensive. They'll be playing a game of whackamole against a bunch of small Russian probes, which if left alone have the potential to turn into a full blown encirclement but which also present excellent opportunities to bleed the Russians with counterattacks against exposed salients. Offense is of course a taller order, especially given their lack of heavy weaponry.

If there is nothing that is more obvious to anyone viewing the Ukraine war objectively is that it has effectively become a proxy war between Russia and US/NATO. The reason why Ukraine is doing so well now as compared to 2014 or Georgia is simply because of all the military hardware, intelligence, economic sanctions and support from the richest country in the world --the US-- and the richest economic bloc in the world --the EU. As neorealists have said, Ukraine was led down a primrose path by US/NATO with the belief that they could enter NATO while all agreeing behind closed doors that this would never happen. They led Ukraine to vehemently come to every peace negotiation absolutely refusing to follow Minsk and refusing to be independent and not join NATO. 

Now clearly Zelensky is under tremendous pressure by these external forces and right-wing competitors to not give an inch to Russia, resulting in the breaking apart of peace negotiations and the desire to use all the military hardware provided by the West to fight the Russians to the last Ukrainian. The longer the war continues the more people die and the more Ukraine will be turned into rubble. But instead of avoiding the war or ending it as soon as possible avoiding more death and destruction, these ideologists are willing to sacrifice Ukraine in this proxy war simply to degrade Russia. Meanwhile, we can see all the absolute ruin the cities of Ukraine are in and the entire generation of people that will have died. Even if we stopped the war today, how long would it take Ukraine to rebuild to prewar standards? If the war last another 3 months? Another 6 months?

Taiwanese people should value their own interests above others. Absolutely the goal is not to see the deaths of thousands of Taiwanese people and the cities of Taiwanese turned into rubble. Whether a war would help degrade China so that it becomes much weaker than the US should be of no concern to Taiwan. But, it looks like the West is pushing Taiwan to ignore China's redlines just as they did with Russia's redlines. This is not what is right or wrong, but instead great power politics. Great powers do would not allow redlines to be ignored just as Cuba had no right to independently host Soviet missiles. Similar goes with the US using the Monroe doctrine to use military force so no other great power could establish dominance in the Western hemisphere. If Mexico or Canada wanted to host Russian troops and weapons, the US would not allow that to happen by force. Russia is that much larger than Ukraine and appears to be willing to sacrifice their economy and lives of thousands of Russians to defend their redline issues. I would expect the same with China.

This article does have some of that, and it tells of some of the non-military incidents from that time period as well. It is not a very detailed look at the military actions, but I suppose if it did then it would be a very long piece, and probably not free either. 

Some people who comment on the forum may know about the details then are listed in the paper, but this was an interesting overview for someone for whom the details of that time period are little more shaky. 

The article does not go into the levels of uniformed Russian military personnel in the country either. And I thought that was a missed opportunity when discussing the shootdown of MH-17 for example. 

The aspect of the war that it does cover is that of the use of force and escalation. The reluctance of both sides to kill and engage directly was surprising given the state of the war as I write this. If I can be so bold as to speculate myself, I think that this shows that this was not a war of the people, and there was very little hate before this. For everyone involved in the early days it very much seemed that people were pushed into a lethal conflict that they did not want or believe in. 

------------

&gt; The initial unwillingness of the Ukrainian army to use force in Crimea and against non-uniformed targets in Donbas may well have encouraged the separatists to escalate the situation. This in turn prodded the volunteers to take to arms. Yet by early 2015, a unit of the Azov volunteer battalion was pinned down by incoming small-caliber mortar fire in Shyrokyne. Suddenly, they witnessed two huge but harmless geysers of water in the nearby Sea of Azov. One of the Azovites was puzzled by the event. Either the adversaries could not shoot, or they missed on purpose. Three years later, the volunteer unexpectedly encountered a Russian volunteer artillerist, who had fought with the separatists in Shyrokyne. The artillerist explained that it was common to shoot the opening barrages to the side of enemy forces in populated areas to give civilians an opportunity to seek shelter. After this, fire could be retargeted more accurately. As the fire against the Azov unit likely came from a 240 mm mortar, there was no shelter in Shyrokyne that could have withstood a direct hit. Resultingly, the fire was never redirected.122

&gt;“Challenges to Security in Space — 2022,” is DIA’s second iteration of an unclassified intelligence product that examines the space and counterspace capabilities of the militaries of America’s nearest competitors. This volume details the space defense and military goals — including strategy, plans and intentions — of China and Russia and, to a limited extent, Iran and North Korea. It builds on the original 2019 report, with updates on threats to the U.S. space posture and details operational risks associated with the growing amounts of orbital debris including fragmentation from collisions and battery explosions.

2. Minor Russian victory. Russia achieves breakthrough but does not encircle. Ukraine retreats in good order and forms a new line in Dnipro/Zaporizhzhia.

3. Draw. Russia achieves breakthrough, but is stopped cold. However, Ukraine expends significant resources stopping the offensive and has spent their reserves. Russia has nothing to show for their latest 'all-in' but Ukraine has no forces available to launch offensives to take back land. 

4. Ukrainian victory. Ukraine stops the offensive, and counterattacks either in this front or around Kherson. Russian BTGs are spent and cannot stop UKR attacks or reinforce pressured sectors.

The White House walked back the statement and said that the US was not changing it's openly stated policy of (ironically enough) strategic ambiguity.  That is to say, the US has very deliberately NOT made a commitment to defend Taiwan, but it has also very deliberately NOT said it won't defend Taiwan.  Further, the President is empowered by law to be able to defend Taiwan without asking Congresses permission, but also does not have an obligation to defend Taiwan.

This is a very different policy than what the US has with Ukraine.  The US was very clear that it had no defense treaty with Ukraine and would not move to defend Ukraine.  

So what does it mean that Biden said that the US would come to Taiwan's defense and then later reverted back to strategic ambiguity?   There are a few possibilities.  Biden could be going senile, was simply confused, and gave an incorrect or thoughtless answer that means nothing. Or, Biden could be going senile and was just speaking from the heart forgetting US policy of not announcing that the US will defend Taiwan, accidentally revealing real US policy that he forget was supposed to be secret. Or, Biden intentionally said that he would defend Taiwan and then walked back the comment a little as a deliberate threat to China, and this is more deliberate and continued and renewed strategic ambiguity from America that could be a bluff or not on Biden's real position.

""brown rice will store only 7 to 10 years after you put some labor into it, about 12 at the outside, and parboiled white rice will store 20 to 25 years in ideal conditions and has most of the nutrition of brown (other than the bran fiber and a big dose of EFA and magnesium and some other minerals, of course...plus being a little lacking to me in flavor and texture). I just like brown (and red and purple) rice much better than parboiled white rice. And my beans aren't good for more than 7 to 10 years, either, so brown rice that stores 7 to 10 years is all I really need. And I have it. Plus the way I prep it to get a long storage life also gives me low-arsenic rice.""",05840f1bc5d3e1027a2d564cd8d584da41173616,True,False,,,,,0,1650327128,,0,{},i59zghu,False,t3_u6fhxx,False,True,t1_i59w36h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6fhxx/recent_assessments_have_called_for_taiwan_to/i59zghu/,1650327145,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650298328.0,
