Surely the Allies had some idea, but it appears that the extent and severity of this persecution were underestimated in its scope, brutal and inhuman conditions, and the cold calculation &amp; efficiency needed by people to even create and maintain such a thing. 

Your point is a good one regarding Stalin getting off the hook for technically being among the Allies who won the war when in reality the only reason they went against Germany was because Germany broke the pact and invaded them.

If people don’t go to work? Do you really think the police will come to your house and coerce you with a weapon at your head to function? I can absolutely understand that you believe all this „demonstrate“ shit  will not work - and in a totalitarian dictatorship it will not work - repercussions are mostly too big for the single person and people fear this - it’s ok. But stop functioning in the society and if enough people do it - the state is no more. Gandhi showed the world how effective passive resistance is. But the world forgot about it. In Addition there are other signs of resistance - like FSB leaks and so on. I don’t think an outside invasion is the ONLY way to stop Putin and his cronies - but I think also it’s the most likely version. 
And I don’t think that especially you are a coward. Don’t do your work. Sabotage everything - like Schindler did it. RuZZia today has to fall and become something new - a start from the scratch.
