Correction: Why was Crimea annexed before anything else? Not because of material pursuits, but because of abstract forces. History and identity, which is also why the Crimeans welcomed Russian annexation. 

Long story short, Crimea evokes a strong sense of national pride for Russians as it represents in some ways the Stalingrad of the early Russian empire. And while the peninsula is strategically important, it is not strategically necessary. 

There may have been a point where the prospect of having a monopoly over Europe's oil imports was enough to warrant an invasion. Yet even those with ideological blinders know that this point has since passed, and with it, any **material justification** for prolonging the war in Ukraine.

&gt;The Black Sea justification is opaquely false,

So why did they annex Crimea before anything else then?

Both navally and legally, whoever holds Crimea controls the Black Sea. Most of the oil under the Black Sea is within the Exclusive Economic Zone of whichever government holds Crimea. Russia would be confined to a tiny slice of it without much oil reserves, and vulnerable to blockage not just by Turkey and Spain but Ukraine too. With Crimea, Russia has unfettered access to all the oil reserves in the Black Sea.

&gt;Why would Russia desire Ukrainian oil and gas when it knows it cannot exploit them for the next several decades?

Again, because it doesn't want to be cut off from the European oil market. With pipelines in an EU-aligned Ukraine, that becomes an option.

&gt;NATO is a defensive organization.

Bombing Libya -- was that ""defensive?""

A quick and decisive action that captures Kyiv and decapitates leadership could have netted him a quick win and minor consequences (especially because Biden has been pretty weak vis-à-vis Russia.)

If the west isn't as fragmented as it's been played up to being, if Ukraine actually does want to distance itself from Russia and grow closer to Europe and the west, if the Ukrainian armed forces aren't as weak as Putin thinks they are, so many potential problems. 

So the only conclusion you can draw is that Putin doesn't maintain his faculties, because this is just bad mission planning and execution.

The US would try to get Brazil to align on them.  If they do, it'll just be a regular economic war, like between the US and his allies.

If Brazil tries to assert himself as an independant Great Power or a Great Power aligned with China, things will be messier.

Despite the reaction that the US have shown regarding the russian aggression of Ukraine, they also want to keep their influence over America.

The US would try to contain Brazil through diplomatic and economic means.  Any military action would be very unlikely. As any significant US involvment in a war, may be an opportunity for China to seize Taiwan.

However, you may see some proxy wars, if the two countries fight for influence over the countries in the area. But that stay unlikely for now.

&amp;#x200B;

What may be likely during Brazil emergence as a Great Power, is a closer alliance with South Africa and India at first. That bloc could become powerful enough, to speak on equal terms with China and US.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it depends strongly on when it happens.  Main reasons of conflicts between the US and Russian and China, is that the US is the current world hegemon and a world super power.
