When they are assaulting a city, it's a 4 to 1 manpower ratio, not a force ratio. How do you measure the force ratio? This is what a paper written by the [National Defense University on the Battle of Grozny](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA394517.pdf) (Go to Page 3)

&gt;  
Since the battle for a city continues non-stop, the Russians learned that they needed fresh troops and adequate reserves. Soviet doctrine called for a 4:1 advantage in troops for urban combat. Some 60,000 Russians and 12,000 Chechens fought in Grozny, yet the Russian's 5:1 advantage was sometimes not enough, because they had to guard every building that they took.

The paper provides a good explanation of the lessons learned during the Battle oF Grozny. Right now the Russians don't have the manpower to encircle all the major cities, let alone take them.

I provided you with a source of Soviet/Russian doctrine on Urban warfare. It pretty much falls in line with the Battle of Mosul (2016) and Battle of Marawi, Philippines (2016). Even in the [Battle of Fallujah the US had a 4 to 1 troop advantage against insurgents.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Fallujah)

To make your arguments convincing you have to figure out how much artillery they have around Kyiv for example. What is the rate of replenishment etc?  If you spent a day you could calculate how many artillery the Russian have surrounding each major city 

Here is an [article on Russian logistics](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/)

&gt;The Russian army makes heavy use of tube and rocket artillery fire, and rocket ammunition is very bulky. Although each army is different, there are usually 56 to 90 multiple launch rocket system launchers in an army. Replenishing each launcher takes up the entire bed of the truck. If the combined arms army fired a single volley, it would require 56 to 90 trucks just to replenish rocket ammunition. That is about a half of a dry cargo truck force in the material-technical support brigade just to replace one volley of rockets. There is also between six to nine tube artillery battalions, nine air defense artillery battalions, 12 mechanized and recon battalions, three to five tank battalions, mortars, anti-tank missiles, and small arms ammunition — not to mention, food, engineering, medical supplies, and so on. Those requirements are harder to estimate, but the potential resupply requirements are substantial. The Russian army force needs a lot of trucks just for ammunition and dry cargo replenishment.  


Russia has 10 Combined Arms Armies in Ukraine. That is 500-900 Rocket Launchers in the whole campaign.  Just say there are 180 of these things surrounding Kyiv.  You might launch 1 salvo a day if you are lucky.  

That is why you don't see the type of rocket barrages you saw in World War 2 by the Soviet military where they would field hundreds if not thousands of so-called [Stalin's organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher) to saturate a city. In the Seelow Heights (1945) they had 3300 rocket launchers.  Berlin in 1945 had the same population of Kyiv today.

You can work yourself whether 500-900 rocket launchers is enough for the whole campaign.

I forgot, but there's one more: put European boots on Western Ukraine, wherever there aren't Russian ground troops. Give them air cover from bases inside Ukraine. Make it publicly known to the Russians that fighting, if breaking out, will be limited to troops and forces inside Ukraine and this will not activate Article 5.

Which Head of State of NATO states and SACEUR have the guts to do that, though. 

Stalin and the Red Army was accused of deliberately standing on the Vistula river, holding back and watching the Polish insurgents being liquidated by the German troops during the Warsaw uprising. Now, there were technical, tactical, and operational reasons why, but no doubts, Stalin would have wanted the Polish resistance gone anyway; better it be done by Germans and Soviet bullets. I've seen analyst (Phil Karber) now accusing NATO of standing and watching the Ukrainian resistance ground down and Phil suggested the strategy above. I took the liberty of adding a couple of details.

https://youtu.be/4tX9q9JhCW8

He made the points of if NATO does nothing more than handing the Ukrainians a few crates of weapons and ammo, they are no better than the British and French watching the Poles getting destroyed (did France and Britain attack Germany on the offence in 1939 after Hitler declare war on Poland?), the British and Americans saying ""we didn't know the Jews were getting killed"", or the Reds watching the Polish resistance crushed. 

Personally, it's understandable why NATO states do not want to intervene directly like that. Yes, and they are not better. If you don't support that, you are also no better (unless you plan to be a foreign volunteer in Ukraine, which go ahead). NATO states having an open door policy to Ukrainian refugees will be a little bit better; nobody accepted Jewish refugees fleeing from Germany. 

That's my considerations and reasonings. You don't like it and think that it's helping Putin with ethnic cleansing? Fine. Put NATO troops into Ukraine, then we talk. Alternatively, nuclear war. There aren't many options.

Where did I mention U.S. briefings? I find U.S. intelligence to be the most credible source on the belligerents' respective losses in this conflict - and U.S. intelligence contradicts Ukrainian claims.

Thus, the latest Ukrainian tally speaks of 14,000 Russian KIA, whereas the latest U.S. range numbers 6,000 - 8,000 KIA.

&gt;The US claims are almost comically wide (4,000 to 6,000 Russian soldiers killed and 4,000 to 21,000 injured).

They're not. You're conflating various claims, made over different timeframes.

The latest range is: 6,000 KIA and 14,000 WIA (20,000 total) to 8,000 KIA and 21,000 WIA (29,000 total).

&gt;What purpose would Ukraine and the US have to lie about such huge ranges?

For Ukraine, same as Russia: morale.

As for the U.S., they're probably not lying.

&gt;And why would we assume Russia's intelligence in Ukraine is better than Ukraine's when Russia can't even communicate between themselves securely?

Did I mention that Russian intelligence was better than Ukraine's? No. I stated that both sides probably resort to ""creative accounting"" in equal measure.

They're bombing/shelling cities and killing thousands of civilians. Why would nuking be beyond them? Simply pour out another propaganda story about how this was actually a NATO nuke, or the Ukrainians nuked themselves once their secret Nazi nuclear program was discovered.

A country with an economy smaller than Canada's is never going to be able to seriously occupy and pacify a country with a population larger than Canada's. A country with an economy smaller than Canada's and no budding tech sector has no hope of a future on the cutting edge. Invading Ukraine doesn't help with any of this.

I've been kind of taken by the idea that the takeover of Ukraine was never really about the stated fears of NATO proximity, in the years prior to this current war Russia seemed able to get away with everything and the most the West did was impose marginally effective sanctions.  It's not imaginable that NATO nations would sign up for an invasion of Russia.

The real goal was enlarging the Russian economic sphere to increase Russia's overall economic security in a world where giant corporations and giant economies are the real dominant power factor.  Russia's real fear wasn't NATO tanks but economic colonization and exploitation from the East and the West, with a population generally too poor and too small to produce a viable competing economic package of developed industries, especially those capable of competitive exports.
 
&gt; Russia has always wanted to be a superpower and it almost never has been one by any measure. If they could just come to grips with the fact that they are a sort of large-ish middle power, they could carve out a niche in the world and their people could be happy and prosper. For centuries this has been the Russian problem.

Way more than anyone is ever comfortable admitting, retiring tenured employees have a bad habit of coming back part time as ""consultants"" billing 3x their old rate.

Russia has been pushing their intelligent people away for years because they're a threat to the state. If some engineering firm gets economically powerful, it's a threat to the powers that be.

I mean, it's not that far fetched at all, there were papers written about foreign fighters in various situations, and I've found my idea multiple times in these - using them as canon fodder, no equipment, but also the issue that there statistically are more war crimes committed by these kind of fighter compared to professional soldiers.

This is way more far fetched, but I'd still bring up volunteers on Bosnian side in the nineties.

If this is representative of the quality of advice available to the CCP the cold war may be easier for America to win than we think.

&gt; However, the blitzkrieg failed, and Russia is unable to support a protracted war and its associated high costs.

This is almost certainly not true. One area where Russia is very self-sufficient is in military hardware and munitions. Russia has a huge volume of kit in storage (much of which will need to be refurbished), a huge operational inventory, and millions of trained reservists due to its conscription system. Its ability to sustain a prolonged conflict is behind only that of the US and China.

&gt; The Russo-Ukrainian war may escalate beyond the scope and region of Ukraine, and may even include the possibility of a nuclear strike.

Absolutely insane take. The propaganda angle in Russia is we are liberating/denazifying Ukraine. There is majority support for the invasion according to anonymous polls but there would be zero support for nuking Ukraine.

&gt; Even if Russia manages to seize Ukraine in a desperate gamble, it is still a political hot potato.

Yesn't. Ukrainians will definitely continue fighting, but Ukraine is part of the Eurasian steppe and not good for insurgency. Every previous attempt by Ukrainians to win a guerrilla struggle against Russia has failed.

&gt; After Putin’s blitzkrieg failed, the hope of Russia’s victory is slim

This is pretty much the opposite of what most experts are telling us, which is that the invasion has gone badly but Ukraine will succumb to Russia's mass eventually. China has historically had very little respect for Soviet/Russian armies and forces since its decentralized, guerrilla-rooted doctrine is completely the opposite: in the 1980s and 90s the PLA thought the Soviets would perform as badly as the Arabs.

&gt; If Putin were to be ousted from power due to civil strife, coup d’état, or another reason, Russia would be even less likely to confront the West. It would surely succumb to the West, or even be further dismembered, and Russia’s status as a great power would come to an end.

The idea Russia will be dismembered is absolutely wild. 80% of Russia is ethnic Russian - what would it even disintegrate into? A democratic post-war Russia, if one emerges (more likely it will just lick its wounds and brood as always), will still be bitter towards the West for making it give up Crimea, Donetsk, etc. - inevitably to be included in any deal lifting sanctions.

&gt; The United States would regain leadership in the Western world, and the West would become more united. At present, public opinion believes that the Ukrainian war signifies a complete collapse of U.S. hegemony, but the war would in fact bring France and Germany, both of which wanted to break away from the U.S., back into the NATO defense framework, destroying Europe’s dream to achieve independent diplomacy and self-defense. Germany would greatly increase its military budget; Switzerland, Sweden, and other countries would abandon their neutrality. With Nord Stream 2 put on hold indefinitely, Europe’s reliance on US natural gas will inevitably increase. The US and Europe would form a closer community of shared future, and American leadership in the Western world will rebound.

*Europe* is getting more cohesive and united, but most Europeans are actually disappointed at the lukewarm stance the US has been taking throughout this crisis. The Biden administration has been very careful about the kind of help it sends to Ukraine and is getting outshined by a lot of European middle powers - its reputation as Europe's protector has been damaged, not improved.

&gt; The unity of the Western world under the Iron Curtain will have a siphon effect on other countries: the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy will be consolidated, and other countries like Japan will stick even closer to the U.S., which will form an unprecedentedly broad democratic united front.

If anything this crisis has proven there are three ""democratic worlds"" - Europe, the US, and democratic Asia. Only the first has done everything it can to help Ukraine, the other two are dragging their feet. At the end of the day neither most Americans nor Japanese, Koreans, etc. think of Europeans as the same people as them. 

&gt; Europe will further cut itself off from China; Japan will become the anti-China vanguard; South Korea will further fall to the U.S.; Taiwan will join the anti-China chorus, and the rest of the world will have to choose sides under herd mentality. China will not only be militarily encircled by the U.S., NATO, the QUAD, and AUKUS, but also be challenged by Western values and systems.

Where has this guy been the past 10 years? That's all already happened. Since China was the only country that was never successfully occupied by the West, it has a government completely alien to everyone else's. If Hu's opinion is at all representative of the foreign office's, they seem to be selling the leadership this kool aid that a meritocratic dictatorship can make itself popular in a world full of democracies and kleptocratic dictatorships. The condition Hu describes has been the case before Ukraine and will be the case after unless China becomes a democracy.

&gt; Given that China has always advocated respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, it can avoid further isolation only by standing with the majority of the countries in the world. This position is also conducive to the settlement of the Taiwan issue.

How could it possibly do that?

&gt; There are already voices in the U.S. that Europe is important, but China is more so, and the primary goal of the U.S. is to contain China from becoming the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific region. Under such circumstances, China’s top priority is to make appropriate strategic adjustments accordingly, to change the hostile American attitudes towards China, and to save itself from isolation.

Contradictory even within the same paragraph. If the US is moving against China to stop it from becoming the dominant power, how will embargoing Russia change that? The US's ""Pivot to Asia"" long preceded the present China-US war of words and happened at a time when China was not front in center in American public attention.

&gt; As a result, China will surely win widespread international praise for maintaining world peace, which may help China prevent isolation but also find an opportunity to improve its relations with the United States and the West.

Unlikely. Everyone will just say ""they took too long to act"" or ""they are still selling Russia goods under the table"", while now the Russian government (both Putin's and any government that succeeds him) will see China as a backstabber. This would result in a military buildup on the Sino-Russian border and the need to divert valuable military resources there. China's friendship with Russia isn't because Russia is useful, it's because the alternative is Sino-Russian confrontation and a loss of the overland gas supply which is vital in any war with the US navy.

&gt;. All nations attempt to use the international world order to their own benefit 

Cool.

Now remember there are those who actively work for its value and to promote them. And there are those who very aggressively work against them while taking advantage. 

&gt;Even the chief guarantor of the international order (the US) ignores / overrides it **from time to time.**

 **from time to time.**

And will have its citizens die to help defend others from time to time. 

Spends more on international aid by far than any other country. 

Is the keystone security guarantor for the worlds democracies. 

Is the heart of a collaborative alliance of collective security and ensuring that the worlds oceans are free for trade. 

People like you who see the system as transactional cannot grasp the core values. You see moderate rule breaking as proof there are no rules. Only see your self interest and only see those opposing it in light of your self interest. You cannot grasp the altruism of a world of open economies, collective security and agreed rules. 

You see hypocrisy to exploit for your national interest. 

Never the huge investment that the believers in the system made and make to make it work. 

Putin is the lamp to shine on others true view of the system.

As the basic grunt won't get red dots or any other kind of optics I'd argue an AK-47 will be perfectly fine, it's a reliable weapon in these climates, it's reasonably strong against kevlar while not being a total overkill. I could imagine that some would prefer the bigger caliber, as, depending on the surroundings, soldiers complained that the 5,56 was to weak, to easily get of target by small obstructions,..
So, AK-47 isn't what I'd imagine as a worst case, not even close. When the foreign volunteers will be sent into meat grinders with mosin nagants I will be alarmed.

To not spam, I'll only quote the last part. 

China has empty real estate, that's true, but here's what they don't tell you. The successful ones started more or less the same way as the unsuccessful ones. If you are looking to bat 100, you are not going to be able to. In the end, it's just going to be nothing, instead of some successes. 

Also, a lot of those places are now retirement cities. Low cost of living, new infrastructure, and China can even import medical and domestic helpers. That's still low now, but give it time. Those people can buy an apartment too, since it's cheap with all new infrastructure.

It's just what's happening now, and with time, I believe more and more will be worked out. 

I will also mention, those cheap labor, lead to increase spending in education, infrastructure, health and much more. While it's true, America did its part in making China today, but much like WW1, where America got its weapons, organization and experience from its allies, by 1918, it's an American army. 

&gt;in order to legitimize beefing up their own power, it doesn't strike me as the kind of move a country getting closer to China would make. Meantime Australia is getting those nuclear subs, and India certainly doesn't seem to be growing any closer. Do they have -any- proper friends in the region, outside their puppet mafia state of NK?

I think the window is narrowing for US to do anything against China. That's my opinion though, based on my own readings and experiences. 

I think people confuse weak with getting closer. Think Olympics China and Korea. If China cannot compete with Korea at all, and had no chance of even being in the Olympics, would Koreans ""hate"" China?

If China cannot compete with the US, and ended up with more gold, would US even care that Ellieen Gu was competing for China? 

That's not friendship, that's weakness. 

As to other regional buildups, they exist, but even combined, it is nothing in front of China. Even the world combined is at most slightly more than China. That's including the US. China is going all in on this. Its naval ship yard is being expanded once again. It just finished a new facility to build multiple Nuclear Subs at the same time. Y-20B(domestic engine) are being fielded and much much more. 

&gt;ockading a country like Taiwan or Japan. But their own supply lines are extremely vulnerable, and they are surrounded by countries that are not friendly to them.

Long yes, but 20 years is also not that long. It's already been 40 since the real start of China's reforms. 

China's supply line is safe. US won't even blockade Russia, but for China it will? Blockade is an act of war. It's a step neither China nor America wants to take. Too unpredictable. 

There's a reason, I only mentioned ships and planes, not organization or experience. While those are expanding, I don't see them playing a major role, because the real war will be fought in the conference rooms. 

It's what's in the water that matters. It's what's in the air. What America can do is not what it can actually do to China, but what it's perceived as can do. 

Once the carrier balance is close to non existent, it will be an entirely different story. 

&gt;d 10-15 years of power, what would make him change course now? And if he continues on this path for another 10 years, do you think the Chinese are going to be worse or better off?

The thing with right now, is that it's right now. Soft power is one thing, but it can only exist with hard power. Korea didn't export its culture until much later, while the middle east a land rich with culture is only exporting oil. 

I also got another view of wolf warrior diplomacy. China has tried being patient and got bombed in Belgrade. India will also soon find out, no one cares, unless you make a fuss. Once China is taken seriously, it can tone down its actions, but until then, if it doesn't forcibly insert itself everywhere, it won't be invited anywhere.

G7 and G8 never involved China. But whatever gets created after this will. Unless it's just a who loves America more club, then China probably won't be invited to that. 

Chinese opinion is now being taken more and more into account, with more power, it will be more and more seriously. There's a reason America and China will sit for meetings and no one invited India.",1459f7c7df0cac964dcd0f075105f1009ec76384,True,False,,,,,0,1647549791,,0,{},i12fbcd,False,t3_tfz32g,False,True,t1_i1256v7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfz32g/possible_outcomes_of_the_russoukrainian_war_and/i12fbcd/,1647549808,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647520991.0,

This is close to an existential crisis for the west. Not that it threatens their existence, but that it calls to the reason the current world order was built. If China wants to die on Putins hill, then so be it. 

A system was designed during WWII that includes the UN and the system that borders should be unchangeable by war.

Post war collective security and a growing system of international trade was added. There was an open invitation to anyone who signed up to the rules. 

Post Cold War the core system was extended to ex Eastern Europe while countries like China were very actively courted into the economic system. 

The US lost patience in 2016. Europe has kind of gotten there with the Chinas diplomacy over the past few years.

Time will tell.  The Chinese are currently making a big gamble.  They've essentially borrowed themselves into superpower status, and it remains to be seen if they can continue their current trajectory without having the bottom fall out beneath them.  They've taken advantage of Western naivety for just long enough for the rest of the world to catch on – in America we have an issue with assuming 'friendly' relations are 'good' relations.  (Not to mention the idea that once something starts growing, it never stops...)  The Chinese have capitalized on that and subsequently managed one of the biggest growth spurts in history.  But they may be running out of gas.  Demographics catches up eventually, and thirty years of one child policy has left them dangerously low in replacement rate.  Numbers amongst working age has been declining since 2012.  Meantime some of their biggest drivers of growth – real estate and investment – have been getting hammered this year.  Is it the end for the Chinese economy?  Probably not.  But when you've got some 90 million uninhabited homes in a country where millions of recently graduated kids can't find jobs, millions of young men will never be able to get married (simply not enough women), and people are seeing their life's savings wiped out with the tumbling real estate market, you may have some issues with trying to catch up long enough to buck the status quo.  
As I understand it, the CCP realizes that they have a narrowing window of opportunity to grab and hold the power they have – some say they're banking on the AI revolution/4th industrial revolution to pay big dividends – and their bellicose rumblings and massive shipbuilding projects serve to shore up both their internal perception of self, and external face.  Hard power bulks up public support at home.  Will the Chinese having 7 carriers to sling around the Pacific change the Japanese calculus on who to side with?  Again, time will tell.  Right now it's probably too early.  But... if they continue with their aggressively forceful  
style of diplomacy, I'm not sure I see it happening.  It could've been argued the Japanese and Asia as a whole were trending closer toward China in the 90s-early 00s (even Australia had a go at trying to 'be asian', but got slapped back by everybody else for being too white...), but it seems those days are over.  When Japan is openly discussing rewriting their constitution – or at least, 'reinterpreting' it – in order to legitimize beefing up their own power, it doesn't strike me as the kind of move a country getting closer to China would make.  Meantime Australia is getting those nuclear subs, and India certainly doesn't seem to be growing any closer.  Do they have -any- proper friends in the region, outside their puppet mafia state of NK?   
America's relative power may be weaker due to the vast number of nations that have experienced such a wealth of growth and modernization since the end of WW2, but China has a long, long road ahead of it if they really want to tilt the balance of power.  When you rely on so many imports to survive – coal, oil, food, raw materials – and your trade lanes pass by a whole host of countries either unfriendly, or at other times downright hostile to you – it's a tough proposition to both project power and protect what you have at home.  It's not all about the number of carriers, though doubtless the CCP wants people to believe that. China will have to be able to cover itself from its own coastal waters, all the way to the middle east.  So far as I know they have no friendly ports between capable of supplying a supercarrier.  What happens when the oil stops flowing, the food stops coming and you suddenly have 1.4 billion people to feed?  It's all well and good to talk about China blockading a country like Taiwan or Japan.  But their own supply lines are extremely vulnerable, and they are surrounded by countries that are not friendly to them.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they want anything like a war.  That's how they lose.  And to be completely honest, I struggle to see a productive path for them moving forward.  They blew the whole idea of a 'soft power' win when they starting acting like an angsty teen on the world stage.  They can't win a hard power conflict with no friends.  And right now, the talk is largely about getting away from China, not closer.  Things can change... but when you've got one dictator running things, with probably another good 10-15 years of power, what would make him change course now?  And if he continues on this path for another 10 years, do you think the Chinese are going to be worse or better off?",2f28373717a8463830267044d5ac8d2600d05a1f,True,False,,,,,0,1647545959,,0,{},i1256v7,False,t3_tfz32g,False,True,t1_i117bvb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfz32g/possible_outcomes_of_the_russoukrainian_war_and/i1256v7/,1647545976,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647517159.0,

[Many](https://freedomhouse.org/countries/nations-transit/scores) authoritarian countries have become democracies or are in the process. The USSR only fell 30 years ago, and many countries are still dealing with the fallout of US intervention and the dictators our government installed/supported *cough* Pinochet *cough.* It takes time. Some of the best democracies and constitutions will come from examining the constitutions of other nations and improving on those. We are seeing feminist constitutions being written by historically marginalized and brutalized populations in the Middle East. We have young Chileans participating in the writing of their new constitution. Hell, some of the most progressive, democratic, and anti-corruption state constitutions ever were written, in part, by former enslaved individuals during Reconstruction. If that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is. 

It's the old democracies, like the US, who are at risk for backsliding. Americans have taken for granted what our ancestors fought for (and stole. I am aware of the oversimplification here regarding metacolonialism), and the politicization of US history since its inception has been complicit in that.

I'm honestly surprised their headstones don't say ""fuck Tories"" because their writings and documented rantings expressed this sentiment repeatedly. I can hike from my grandma's house to the cemetery to visit her, and then walk the property me and my cousins inherited that was granted to our ancestors buried in the cemetery for fighting in the wars!

Poison was seen as ""against the rules"" for a long while in the west. The Hague Convention outlawed them and through in gasses as part of it (1899) Post WWI there was a renewed general ban on poisoned gasses and biological weapons as part of the reaction to the horror of war and the long standing view that poison was not acceptable. Tear gasses are in as they were used as a mix with other chemical weapons to try to get the troops to take off their gasmasks. Obviously not a thing for modern gas masks but the over all provision that all gasses and liquids that are not used to explode are to be considered chemical weapons to prevent people trying to get around it so maloderants are in the banned grouping. 

Thermobarics are just explosives that use oxygen from the atmosphere rather than oxidiser mixed with the explosives.

So circulators work just as described above. A signal input on one port will exit strongly on the next port, but not the other ones. The analogy a lot of people use is the circulator is like a glass of water where you've used a spoon to spin the water into a vortex. If you dropped something in the water, it'd have an easy time moving in the direction of rotation, and a difficult time moving against it.

In a circulator something analogous is happening. There's a magnetic field running vertically through the device from two permanent magnets, and this causes something similar to the rotating water when radio waves are input to the ports of the device.

""But the first shipment did arrive, and initial training was conducted by a contractor from Lockheed before the training program was taken over by the Security Assistance Training Management Organization (SATMO). This little-known organization has Warrant Officers, Master Gunners, and others on staff specifically to train foreign partner forces. Working with the Ukrainian military for six years, SATMO delivered an additional 200,000 pounds of lethal military aid to Ukraine in late 2021.

As the Russians learned that Ukraine now had Javelins, their T-72 tanks in Donbas became less aggressive, and pulled further back from the frontlines, the U.S. military official said.

Eventually, the Multinational Training Group-Ukraine was established in the Western part of the country, where battalions and then entire brigades were trained by the U.S. Military on a quarterly basis. Part of that training also included learning how to use the Javelin.

The U.S. Military source that Connecting Vets spoke to stated that the intelligence community was concerned about Russian troops on Ukraine's borders starting in the summer of 2021 and that the Javelins themselves were likely taken out of the storage facility and issued to units that fall. With war breaking out in late February, initial reports indicate a weak Russian performance during the opening salvo of their campaign.

However, the numbers of tanks killed by Ukrainian soldiers, with the Javelin or other anti-tank weapons, are difficult to take seriously. Mostly appearing on social media, these numbers are likely to be exaggerated by the Ukrainians and downplayed by the Russians. The usual fog of war makes it even more difficult to ascertain accurate numbers.

However, a U.S. Special Operations official monitoring the conflict in Ukraine told Connecting Vets that he had seen estimates of 280 Russian armored vehicles taken out by the Javelin as of this writing, out of 300 total missiles fired.""",e349fda45aae5db656714dbfcb4428a715beacb8,True,False,,,,,0,1647539132,,0,{},i11ne68,False,t3_tgatgj,False,True,t1_i1170p3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgatgj/ukraine_megathread_march_17/i11ne68/,1647539146,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647510332.0,

&gt; Many factors contributed to the development and implementation of the SIOT concept. Much credit goes to the Sri Lankan serving officers’ ability to be self critical. Long hours of soul searching and sharing the stories of combat failure from the earlier days of the conflict led to “prudent analysis.” In recognition of the sacrifice of fallen comrades, officers and men rededicated themselves to the difficult task of combat innovation. They developed a training program that mixed the Sri Lankan infantry’s conventional past with the hard-won lessons of years of unconventional warfare. The innovative concept of creating small SIOTs drew from the special forces experience as well as capitalizing on simple villagers’ inherent field skills.

The reason that I am reposting this excellent article is the lessons from it keep twirling around in my head due to the war in Ukraine. I get the impression that small dispersed forces are being very effective for the Ukrainians as well. 

The small mobile teams of well trained and lead infantry were far more effective than traditional large forces in Sri Lanka. These tactics were greatly enhanced by night vision, suppressed small arms, and effective calling of fires (artillery). Add the now famous ATGM and MANPAD weaponry to this mix and you might have an effective way to fight a superior foe in Ukraine.",a001c2cbef6c3a88858313f6c188d45f3d48ab14,True,False,,,,,0,1647538684,,0,{},i11m8ak,True,t3_tgfbgg,False,True,t3_tgfbgg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgfbgg/infantry_innovations_sri_lankas_experience_with/i11m8ak/,1647538696,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647509884.0,

Leningrad was repeatedly cut off from outside help. It was able to receive outside aid on multiple occasions, but if anything that speaks to a larger truth...

&gt; The truth of the matter is - big cities cannot endure prolonged sieges if they are completely cut off.

...that big cities are very hard to completely cut off. Russia, for instance, probably doesn't have the forces to maintain an effective siege of Kyiv (at least with the forces currently committed to the Kyiv region). They can't even cut off Kharkiv right now, and even if they do, it will take them weeks more to mass enough forces to make that siege effective.

&gt; You cannot preposition 1.5 million tonnes of food in Kyiv expecting a one-year siege.

You don't have to. I don't know where you get this idea that the Ukrainians have to prepare enough food to feed the entire city. They need enough to feed the *defenders*. Either the Russians allow civilians to flee the city, or they create the exact sort of conditions that result in the erosion of their red line.

&gt; If you think NATO is going to supply Kharkiv with air deliveries and Russia is just going to stand and watch I don't think we agree on what Putin has warned would be his red line.

I think we probably do agree on what Putin's red line is, but if you think that a constant IO campaign (especially one that highlights civilian suffering), time, and a giant heaping of nuance can't erode that red line, I think you're mistaken. What does Putin do when a giant convoy of Red Cross aid vehicles is parked outside a siege, being prevented from entering by Russian troops, and there is constant news coverage on-the-ground from the convoy and more showing the civilian suffering in the city? What does he do when a chartered cargo plane stuffed with aid and NGO reps announces it will be flying into Kharkiv? Does he shoot that down?

&gt; The Russian need to hurry is entirely a product of Western imagination.

The Russians have lost multiple brigades worth of equipment and probably taken multiple brigades worth of casualties. They cannot afford to continue losing forces at this rate, or even half this rate for another six months. Time is clearly their enemy here.

I guess, we can just see. If Mariupol is still providing organized resistance in another couple weeks, we can surmise that they made extensive preparations to endure a siege.",7fe5f3455489b80a8f78df723f9f44bcf2b3aa59,True,False,,,,,0,1647538336,,0,{},i11lbmk,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0zytjy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i11lbmk/,1647538351,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647509536.0,

That's disputable. The main problem for the Russians are pockets of regular military resistance, centred on medium-sized cities, that generate raiding parties striking at Russian supply lines. If they mop up those pockets, the situation can improve.

[],False,,elmonoenano,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ecxx,False,False,"People make a kind of category error when they think about international law. They try to think of it the same way that they think about stuff like the criminal code or something like Clean Water Act. But that's not how international law works. International law is between sovereigns. It's not imposed, it's accepted. B/c of that it works more like a contract. Where a set number of parties agree to things and dictate penalties under the contract.

To get more and more people to agree to something, you can either use persuasion or you can use force. Usually there's a combination. But it takes time. The other big problem is that people think of international law time frames like they think of national law time frames and they don't work like that either. Slavery is a good example for all of this.

In 1807 you have this agreement between the moral side of the anti-slavery argument and the foreign policy side in England and the British outlaw the slave trade. Their navy is powerful enough to do something about it and they start raiding slave trader's ships (who are usually their enemies ships, or at least their enemies allies). Then the US bans importation of slaves in 1808 and getting in on the action benefits the domestic slave trade in Virginia, a very powerful political constituency in the US at the time. So now the US's moral backers, abolitionists, and their commercial interests, domestic slave traders, can serve their interests and hold themselves out as making a big moral decision. They can now adopt the custom and back the English ban. Then France finally gets around to banning slavery after Napoleon and they don't have anything to lose and they're trying to be a standard bearer of human rights so they get in on it. Pretty soon if you want to claim any philosophical association with the Enlightenment you have to be in on this ban and you start making treaties. By 1841 if you want to be a modern world power you are joining the Treaty For the Suppression of the African Slave Trade. 

So through a combination of moral concerns, self interest, custom, self perception, and coercion you end with a treaty.

That treaty is expanded on, there's another moral shift against slavery as a whole throughout the world by the end of the 19th century so that even countries like Brazil no longer want a part of the trade. Finally in the 1960s, almost every country in the world has signed onto a treaty banning slavery. It took 160 years, but international law pretty effectively banned slavery. There are still exceptions mostly where a country's government has broken down. But for the most part arguments about slavery in countries with a functioning government is about whether or not something is oppressive enough to count or an argument about corruption.

So we want to emphasize norms to get other countries to go along with treaties that force commitments and can have penalties for violating the norm. And once a small norm is in place, work can be done to expand the norm.

International law doesn't work on short time frames and it works by consensus so thinking of it in the terms of criminal law or environmental regulations or something like that is just a category error.",c1e1e1bb81f908ec034015ad57312558b1451067,True,False,,,,,0,1647535794,,0,{},i11eo7r,False,t3_tgatgj,False,True,t1_i10xwb5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgatgj/ukraine_megathread_march_17/i11eo7r/,1647535811,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647506994.0,

This war does not meet the definition of a proxy war. It was not instigated by the US/NATO.

Nor is it being sustained to bleed the Russians. If Zelenskyy accepted a peace deal with Putin today, there is zero chance the US would impede it. The problem with a peace deal is Putin, he doesn't want one, can't take one, and is too untrustworthy to strike one.

Another way to phrase this is that Zelenskyy and his government ask the world to vastly widen the scope of the war by having the US/NATO get directly involved with hope and presumption that it will end the war.

Zelenskyy actions are completely understandable, but there is a big difference between asking ""to end it"" and asking ""widen it, so that it might end."" The only way Zelenskyy can end this war on his own is surrender to point's Putin demands.

Yes.

2. You are really overestimating the effects of propaganda. To follow your own example - yes, let's look at Americans. Even in our most dramatic and contested elections, a huge portion of Americans are apolitical - they don't watch Fox news, don't vote and just go about their lives.

Ukraine knows this. They know that the US and NATO need them to be the proxy country in this conflict. The world wants them to grind the Russian military machine down, even though the costs to Ukraine will be immense.

Zelenskyy and his government beg the world to end this now. It puts the West in a tricky position, where they want to support Ukraine but they also want to break the Russian military.

US alliances are strengthened, but the problem is the US itself is not strengthened. 

The lead in every category for the US is decreasing, China is adding more of every type of ship and aircraft. It's reasonable, the US is not going to go to 15 carriers, that would be insane. However, China can go to 10 carriers itself. 

Once a tipping point has been reached, then it's interesting. Would Japan and Taiwan be more or less interested in this alliances once China has something like 7 carriers. 

Then, the equation for them is China can destroy their entire fleet and blockade them before America has enough time to mobilize a large enough force to maybe do something. Because by then, just the seventh fleet would not be enough. 

Even for the US, would America want its seventh fleet be under threat and potentially lose it before it even has a chance to form into a combined fleet? Hard to say.

Slavery was made illegal when its immorality was accepted. 

&gt;I gotta ask why people put so much emphasis on a state action being illegal. 

A large portion of the states on Earth are subject to disputed claims of territory having belonged to someone else or having regional majorities of a differing ethnic group to the majority and often with that ethnicity being the majority in a near by country.

In short the worlds borders are hotly disputed. So the moral injection not to start changing them by external force is one many if not most nations feel strongly about. 

For the same reasons that the same crime under differing circumstances will have differing penalties in law, the circumstances of something being illegal in international relations will produce differing senses of how grievous a violation of law it is. 

This is totally unprovoked.

Purely about a land grab and perhaps the elimination of an entire state from the United Nations. 

The post WWII settlement, not simply the ""liberal order"" but one the Marxist regimes happily signed up too and almost all new nations have accepted is that borders are not great, but its better than the anarchy of force to get what you want.

This should be obvious. Has been widely discussed so one questions why it is being brought up 3 weeks into the war as if it was some great revelation that no one had thought of. 

Id encourage you to accept my answer and do some reading on your own.

The Ukrainians are currently containing them with 1x Air Assault, 2x Mechanized and 1x Territorial Defense Brigades, with a total of 18x maneuver battalions.

**Coming north from Belarus east of the Dnipro and from the general Kursk area inside Russia**, the Russian [41st Combined Arms, 2nd Guards Combined Arms, and 1st Guards Tank Armies](https://twitter.com/JominiW/status/1504330630573789188/photo/1) have between them 48x BTGs. They have the longest supply lines of all, with the main Sumy-Kyiv axis stretching for over 300 km. This is the area where Ukrainian light infantry ambushes have had most of their successes.

The Ukrainians are defending with various groupings:

\-Defending Kyiv's eastern approaches: 1x Territorial Defense and 1x Air Assault Brigades, with 9x maneuver battalions

\-Chernihiv-Nizhyn area (cut off): 1x Tank and 1x Territorial Defense Brigades, with 10x maneuver battalions

\-Harassing the Russians along the Kyiv-Sumy highway: 1x Motorized Infantry Brigade, with 4x maneuver battalions (one of which appears to be cut off in Konotop)

\-Sumy area (cut off): 1x Territorial Defense Brigade, with 6x maneuver battalions

\-Defending the highway to Kharkiv south of Okhtyrka: 1x Mechanized Brigade, with 4x maneuver battalions

For a total of 33x maneuver battalions, almost half of which (17x) are currently cut off behind the main Russian advance. The Russians are allocating large forces to eliminate those isolated Ukrainian units: 24x BTGs, or precisely half of their forces. A further 6x BTGs seem to be patrolling the main highways.

The Russian forces in the Kyiv suburbs amount to merely 7x BTGs, and are wholly insufficient to mount an offensive there - which is why they are on the defensive.

[],False,,BigNavy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fk7n,False,False,"Javelin (or any anti-armor weapon) would be pretty effective against modern warships. US, Russian, and PLAN vessels are basically unarmored - as several have posited, it would be fairly easy to mission kill a warship if you got a 'lucky' hit against their primary weapons system, primary sensors, maybe even their C2 spaces or systems. It is basically impossible to armor antennas. Although phased array radars can still be fairly effective even with part of the array destroyed - my understanding is that Slava-class cruisers have a partially phased array i.e. a height-finding radar similar to the SPS-48.

But talking about the actual tactical employment is where things get interesting. Javelin has an (Open Source) maximum range of 4,000 meters, maybe stretching out to 5,000 meters under some really exceptional circumstances. That's about 5,500 yards. That's not even good for an ante at sea - in open waters, the horizon for a decently sized ship is 11nm or so, or about 22,000 yards. Almost all main batteries are effective at the limits of the horizon too - that means you have to move 16,000 yards or so either unobserved OR under main battery fire from the ship. Or you have to hope that your target closes your position...even in an amphibious assault situation, the amphibious ships and capital ships involved won't close the beach that closely. To be honest, that has a lot more to do with a lot of OTHER threats close to shore - everything from mortar fire and artillery to direct fire from armor. A Javelin is basically a coin flip on what it would try to attack on a warship - a main battle tank has significantly more ability to 'target' the parts of the ship that might cause a mission kill.

And then there's the real threat - they aren't as cheap or as widely available as Javelins, but modern anti-ship missiles are *really* nasty fired from shore, at close range. The C802 is an Iranian copy of a Chinese copy of a 50 year old design - but it has a ship killing warhead and has been effectively fired along a VISUAL BEARING with no I&amp;W or EW warning ([Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Hanit) did it successfully, [Al-Shabab had either some technical issues or was soft-killed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-ship/u-s-navy-ship-targeted-in-failed-missile-attack-from-yemen-u-s-idUSKCN12A082) against a warship [but did pretty well against an unarmed transport vessel](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/5404/hsv-2-swift-destroyed-off-yemeni-coast-by-anti-ship-missile)).

Javelin would be very effective fighting off amphibious assault vehicles trying to wade ashore or small vessels that are transferring logistical support ashore (barges, shallowbottomed boats, etc.).

As an aside - anti-ship cruise missiles in the West are not usually sold/advertised as shore batteries (most commonly sold for employment on surface ships, airplanes, or submarines), but they're all drastically simpler than Patriot - hitting an airplane with a missile is really hard from a physics perspective, but firing a missile and letting it hunt down the biggest hunk of metal it sees is pretty easy. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody hadn't slipped some coastal batteries of Harpoons or Exocets or something comparable in all the arms shipments to Ukraine.

It is how all modern software is developed at every major tech company.

Yes, the US did not try capitulating to Russia to buy peace in Ukraine. Are you really arguing that the US should have destroyed NATO to appease Russia?

&gt;My God, you have to be on the spectrum somewhere. No, ""meet half way"" does not mean kicking Poland and the Baltics out of NATO. ""Meet half way"" means signing a piece of paper that says Ukraine won't join NATO.

Signing a piece of paper that Ukraine won't join NATO was not even 1% of the Russian demands, let alone half way. Half way would have included kicking the Baltics and Romania out of NATO. You're confused, go read the Russian demands and come back.

And there are 10 times that where ATGM's are far far more scarce.

In a world where Russia is a competent and well funded military it would be high priority to develop APS that can help with top-attack. They really don't seem to be that, though.

So no evidence that Russian APS for armata is ineffective. 

&gt;These guys are packing so much hardware that the tank surviving not just one, but two strikes wasn't enough.

While what you say is true take note that:

1. requiring multiple hits enables the defenders to return fire, as well as call in support. This may not have happened in this case, but it will happen in others.
2. Expending munition, while munition is plentiful, it's not infinite, especially not on the battle fronts. The situation is different from one area to the next, For instance it's virtually impossible to resupply Mariople, difficult to resupply Kharkiev, and some areas in Donbass, but not so much to the North center. Even areas that have access to safe supporting logistic lines, that still requires time and effort.
3. Both issues are compounded when facing larger formation with multiple targets. This is a lone tank, but there are many cases when there's a convoy of 4-5.

&gt;shockingly high probability of killing any armored vehicle they encounter out to 1km for $25,000.

Javeline cost $80k. While Skif is much cheaper it's also les effective. Perhaps you were talking about the NLAW, it's effective range isn't close to 1km and costs about $31k.

&gt;I suppose we'll see, but in the world of missile defence attacking has always been easier than defending because if all else fails, it's almost always cheaper to just throw more missiles at the problem than the defender can scale his countermeasures.

Kind of true, but the tank APS isn't really comparable to other missile defense which uses it's own, more costly missiles for interception. Against units that engage in combined arms, with tracking radars, you're not going to get multiple hits per system. APS tanks are equipped with radars that pinpoint the launch point. Tanks can return fire (even automatically) before a second missile can be fired. Not to mention other assets such as drones with thermal to close on the attacker.

I do agree that the limited conflict between Israel and Hamas is not a great indication for how the use of APS would go down in a large scale conflict.

Lastly, I'm not arguing that any weapon could have saved the Russians here, their problems are mostly grounded in tactics and poor motivation.",ae6834a1526a998637bef122dc44d02f44555c5f,True,False,,,,,0,1647525421,,0,{},i10opwm,False,t3_te9067,False,True,t1_i10jyen,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te9067/how_would_a_russian_push_against_nato_look/i10opwm/,1647525432,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647496621.0,

Okay, got it. Let's drop the pretense then of being a ""supporter of liberal democracy, human rights and the rules based international order.""

&gt; I regularly attack my own government for shitting all over [international law]. That also means that when my own government starts using international law to beat others with I can happily state that we have no moral authority to do so, because we ourselves do not care about it until it's convenient. the whole thing is a laughable web of hypocrisy and double standards, and until such time as the 'rules' are actually applied evenly i will continue to not sit here foaming at the mouth with faux outrage that someone else has broken them.

&gt; Something you may not know about me is that i fucking hate misinformation. I hate politicians lying to the public. The one thing i care most about is accurate and nuanced reporting/ understanding of events, not bullshit convenient narratives.

So, basically you'll attack your government and those of other democracies for ""shitting all over [international law], but when an autocracy like Russia launches a conquest of its democratic neighbor, despite condemnation by the UN general assembly and the International Court of Justice, apparently going out of their way to commit war crimes and target the civilian population, we should all just keep quiet because hey, we're not that great either and [hypocrisy would be the greatest war crime of all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljaP2etvDc4).

What a completely garbage standard. Nothing the US, or the UK, or any other Western power has done since at least WWII is anything like comparable to what Russia is doing in Ukraine. Are you going to bring up Iraq here, as if [toppling Hussein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp4U3garYSs) based on flawed intelligence is anything like trying to topple Zelensky? You're such a ""supporter of liberal democracy, human rights and the rules based international order"" that you'll protect them from any stain of hypocrisy by fiercely opposing any attempt to actually defend them, and excusing those who trample on them without shame. After all, any attempt to paint Putin's actions as outrageous would be *misinformation* because, what? The members of NATO and the EU haven't adequately repented for their own sins?

&gt; Have a guess what the easiest and most effective form of deterrance was? Hint: give no reason for the conflict in the first place.

So, the easiest and most effective term of deterrence is appeasement? That's a hot take.

&gt; You know the russians tried to join nato right? [...] The us of course refused because it didn't want to give up its strategic position in europe.

&gt; If egypt applied to join nato they would be rightly rejected based on political and diplomatic justifications, regardless how much 'they wanted to join and they're a sovereign country'.

So, yeah, thanks for answering your own point. After 1991 I think most of the West felt very hopeful for Russia, and hoped it would be set on a trajectory towards alignment with the rest of Europe and maybe even NATO membership one day. But its political dysfunction started almost immediately, and its turn away from that trajectory soon followed. I would *love* to see a changed Russia welcomed into the EU and NATO. Maybe someday it will still be possible.

In combat you don't have the luxury of choosing which weapon to use, you use the one you have/can deploy quickest. No ATGM team out there carries around multiple types of weapons so that they can choose from a variety.

Yes, they do. There are dozens of images and videos over on /r/combatfootage of literally *every single man in the squad* carrying an ATGM. Everything from RPGs to Laws, NLAWs, Javelins, etc all in a mishmash in every team. That's the level of weapons proliferation we're currently seeing. 


&gt;I like to shit on Russian equipment as much as the next guy (really, check my post history on Pantsyr, S-300 and my doubt against kids being sure that S-500 is the bestest without it ever seen combat), but we can't be sure the system has not evolved at all since the early 2000's.

In a world where Russia is a competent and well funded military it would be high priority to develop APS that can help with top-attack. They really don't seem to be that, though. 

&gt;Frankly, we haven't seen how most of the engagements go. But even so, some are engaged from the front, and it's not just front armor that's improved. Side and back armor also matters. A perfect example was posted today. life is not as simple as one hit one kill.

I agree, but this is also kind of proving my first point. These guys are packing so much hardware that the tank surviving not just one, but two strikes wasn't enough. They just kept on hitting it until there was smoke spewing out of the fighting compartment. We now live in a world in which a 12Kg tube can be carried by every man and give them a shockingly high probability of killing any armored vehicle they encounter out to 1km for $25,000. 

&gt;Not just frontal armor, see example above, and that's some upgrade from an old tank. Plenty of modern tanks took hits of RPG's or equivalent to the sides and fought on.

Old RPG 7s and the like, yes. They'll still track tanks, but again, older AT weapons still serve absolutely fine when they're used intelligently to engage things that *aren't* top of the line tanks. We're watching a war unfold where infantry dictate the terms of engagement because the vehicles can't even leave the roads.

&gt;In the general sense not as much, more akin to the development of anti ship missiles, to which warships indeed adapted with countermeasures, passive and active. Israel has already demonstrated that an APS can deal with the ATGM threat. In 2014, at least dozens of attempts to hit one of the Trophy equipped Israeli tanks were made, including with modern ATGM's such as Kornet. In an urban fighting environment, none successful. That is not to say that APS cannot be overcome, but it cannot be discounted either. That's coupled with deploying the tanks in a combined arms approach competently, and using passive protection measures such as smoke.

I suppose we'll see, but in the world of missile defence attacking has always been easier than defending because if all else fails, it's almost always cheaper to just throw more missiles at the problem than the defender can scale his countermeasures.",456424ad605b6411e1d32035070b12cb29fba0c9,True,False,,,,,0,1647523233,,0,{},i10jyen,False,t3_te9067,False,True,t1_i0zwpbj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te9067/how_would_a_russian_push_against_nato_look/i10jyen/,1647523245,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647494433.0,

I think what is more realistic is something like Ukraine accepting that Crimea is de facto Russian (though probably not outright recognition), and an agreement to maintain water supplies to Crimea; the separatist regions are either reintegrated into Ukraine but with significant autonomy, or become 'independent' statelets; and finally, that Ukraine agrees not to join NATO (but crucially, no such agreement on EU membership).

&gt;• Strategic and political forces are driving China’s departure from a minimalist nuclear posture. For most of its modern history, China maintained a small nuclear stockpile mainly suitable for minimal retaliation against an adversary’s nuclear attack. General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jin- ping’s ambitions for great power status, combined with military objectives beyond minimal retaliation, have likely motivated the recent buildup of China’s nuclear arsenal.

&gt;	• At minimum, China’s nuclear buildup enhances its current re- taliatory strategy by better enabling its nuclear forces to deter or respond in kind to a nuclear attack. Chinese leaders may worry that innovations in other nuclear weapon states have undermined their nuclear deterrent, requiring them to make changes in order to keep up.

&gt;• The scale of China’s nuclear buildup, however, suggests it could also be intended to support a new strategy of limited nucle- ar first use. Such a strategy would enable Chinese leaders to leverage their nuclear forces to accomplish Chinese political objectives beyond survival, such as coercing another state or deterring U.S. intervention in a war over Taiwan.",7e586bf9eeda468fc4cc5e15bb489bbd7264d0f6,True,False,,,,,0,1647511373,,0,{},i100vks,False,t3_tg3k5e,False,True,t1_i0ztqye,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tg3k5e/a_closer_look_at_chinas_missile_silo_construction/i100vks/,1647511387,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647482573.0,

It absolutely is, but not just for the reasons you cite.

&gt; Sarajevo would have fallen within a month were it not for foreign intervention.

This is largely because Sarajevo was not prepared to endure a siege. There was no years' long prelude to the siege, and certainly no military strategy predicated on conducting urban warfare.

&gt; Who is going to force Russia to allow such deliveries to Kharkiv and Kyiv? 

Let me first say that it seems very unlikely to me that Russia has the capability to encircle and besiege Kyiv at all at this point. Kharkiv is still not encircled either, and although the Russians may be able to encircle and besiege it, it will likely be several more weeks before they are in a position to do so.

&gt; Or to Mariupol?

Perhaps, no one forces Russia to accept deliveries into Mariupol. That being said, we still don't know how well-stocked Mariupol is. Even forces in an unprepared city/position, like Leningrad or the Alcazar (1936), were able to hold out for months. With a force that has a doctrine based around retreating to cities and operating around prepositioned caches, it's reasonable to believe that force might endure for upwards of a year without outside support.

Beyond that though, I think you're failing to recognize the play here. Ukraine has two outs here:

1. A no-fly zone might be an escalation that Russia wouldn't tolerate, but it will be hard-pressed to deny a humanitarian intervention. NATO could quite reasonably assert that they have the ability to provide humanitarian aid to besieged cities, and Russia would be hard-pressed to shoot down cargo planes packed with NGO personnel, food, and medical aid.

2. Ukraine's broader play is just to stall for time. They aren't trying to win some years' long fight with Russia. They know that if this conflict drags on for even a full year it would be viewed as an unmitigated disaster for Russia. Even just three weeks in, it's pretty clear that Russian leadership sees it as a disaster and has reached the point where they're even suggesting armed neutrality as an option in negotiations. Each week that passes that Russia hasn't definitively won the war is a week they have effectively lost. Time is their enemy here, and so a doctrine that emphasizes delaying Russia's objectives as much as possible is a reasonable path to victory.",903404224136b847ace98667886f032809b976ca,True,False,,,,,0,1647507822,,0,{},i0zwpko,False,t3_tfotud,False,False,t1_i0zvnmg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0zwpko/,1647507835,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647479022.0,

Don't know where this notion is coming from, video games? In combat you don't have the luxury of choosing which weapon to use, you use the one you have/can deploy quickest. No ATGM team out there carries around multiple types of weapons so that they can choose from a variety.

&gt;Russian APS is just a continuation of Soviet APS which has been used in combat and does exactly that - it killed a shitload of their own troops

I like to shit on Russian equipment as much as the next guy (really, check my post history on Pantsyr, S-300 and my doubt against kids being sure that S-500 is the bestest without it ever seen combat), but we can't be sure the system has not evolved at all since the early 2000's.

&gt;Sure, but most of these vehicles aren't being engaged from the front

Frankly, we haven't seen how most of the engagements go. But even so, some are engaged from the front, and it's not just front armor that's improved. Side and back armor also matters. [A perfect example was posted today](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tfw5nr/russian_tank_attacked_in_city_stabilized_zoom/). life is not as simple as one hit one kill. 

&gt;second and third rate anti-tank munitions like LAWs and Recoilless rifles aren't able to penetrate the frontal armor of the newest MBTs

Not just frontal armor, see example above, and that's some upgrade from an old tank. Plenty of modern tanks took hits of RPG's or equivalent to the sides and fought on.

&gt;I just don't see how it's viable for them to operate in an environment in which a 7Kg weapon that costs 2% of the price of the vehicle can engage and destroy them from &gt;2km away.  
&gt;  
&gt;I love my history, and everything about this is incredibly reminiscent of the dawn of the torpedo and the ultimate struggle and failure of heavily armored warships to adapt.  


In the general sense not as much, more akin to the development of anti ship missiles, to which warships indeed adapted with countermeasures, passive and active. Israel has already demonstrated that an APS can deal with the ATGM threat. In 2014, at least dozens of attempts to hit one of the Trophy equipped Israeli tanks were made, including with modern ATGM's such as Kornet. In an urban fighting environment, none successful. That is not to say that APS cannot be overcome, but it cannot be discounted either. That's coupled with deploying the tanks in a combined arms approach competently, and using passive protection measures such as smoke.",04d95f8075968ebeca8d2045cd0f007e7310e625,True,False,,,,,0,1647507816,,0,{},i0zwpbj,False,t3_te9067,False,True,t1_i0vqp2a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te9067/how_would_a_russian_push_against_nato_look/i0zwpbj/,1647507828,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647479016.0,

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; What is the basis for that assessment?

This is really just informed from two sources, both are admittedly limited in value, but taken together and in light of how relatively static that front is and has been, they seem to be consistent with reality.

1. A couple days ago the [Ukrainian General Staff provided a sort of general info dump](https://t.me/lumsrc/1452) on their assessment of the action taking place on each of the various fronts. Obviously, the take they provide will be limited in scope, but it does give some idea of the relative importance and threat of each front. For the Donetsk area, the impression given was largely ""business as usual"". The very fact that they treat the entire SE Ukraine as just one large action, distinct from their reporting on Mariupol is kind of telling as to the intensity of each fight.

2. The relative lack of other reporting of fighting on those fronts, as compared to more high intensity areas. It could be that Russian EW has simply done a better job of shutting down Ukrainian cellphones and such in the Donetsk/Luhansk area, but it seems unlikely that Ukraine would fail to seize any sort of IO opportunity in a high intensity region when they have otherwise prioritized their IO campaign.

More broadly then that, I also kind of object to the notion that fighting along that front has been of a more maneuver warfare character. There might not be major cities being fought over, but the small towns that do exist along that front are likely to be some of the best fortified in Ukraine. The fighting is still taking place primarily along the region's main mobility corridors, and that means it's also still most taking place in and on the outskirts of semi-urban areas.

&gt; The logistical constraints appear to be a much greater factor in the north than in the JFO sector.

It's not so much that the Russians have less logistical constraints in the JFO sector, it's just the case that they were able to capture some of the critical logistical infrastructure they need. Capturing Berdyansk and Melitopol provided them critical rail hubs and the ability to utilize some limited sealift.

Russia's logistical problems are also not entirely the fault of their logisticians. I am convinced they have had a near total collapse of their military engineering capabilities, meaning that the critical engineer task of enabling expeditionary logistics isn't being serviced. By that I mean, when a logistics guy isn't able to actually drive their truck to the front because they lack the roads or bridges to do so, that's the engineer's fault not the truck drivers fault. In the north and SW, this failure has been more apparent. In the SE, it appears that their logisticians are benefiting from some level of competent assured mobility support. The very fact that we haven't seen all sorts of destroyed convoys coming up from Crimea is a good testament to that.

&gt; The BTG count includes the VDV and Naval Infantry, though.

Not disagreeing here, but I'd honestly love it if you could point me to any reference for this. I've been struggling to find anything that supports this one way or the other. My impression was that the BTG count was based on ground forces moved into position in advance of the invasion. I would be really curious to know how the VDV count was assessed given their much greater operational range.

&gt; Save for the IFVs/APCs, those are very similar holdings.

Again, there's a vast difference in quality there. The Ukrainian MBTs aren't just a little lesser in number, they are also typically much older and/or less advanced than their Russian counterparts. A large part of the Ukrainian MBTs, for instance, are just upgraded T-64 tanks. Similarly, the Russians are fielding BMP-3 IFVs vs BMP-2 IFVs and BTR-80's vs BTR-60's.

There certainly are some obsolete and older model vehicles in the Russian forces, but just looking at the [losses on both sides](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) we can get a decent idea of each sides force composition.

And that's what the Russian terror tactics partly bank on. They can terrorise the population under the plausible deniability of saying ""the Ukrainian army had positions there"" and in most cases it's impossible to verify either one way or another, as Russians have the incentive to claim one thing and Ukrainians the incentive to claim something else. That's how the Russians attempted to pre-justify bombing the theatre in Mariupol saying that ""Azov has an HQ in its basement"".

And it becomes worse once we start talking probability in terms of decision making. What if someone misidentifies the buildings they take fire from? What if the area had a military patrol and it left, but the enemy hasn't seen them leaving? What if there's an observation post that even the civiliqns aren't aware of? I think the classic and ultimate example here is from Iraq or Afghanistan of ""how sure must you be that the kid is holding an actual rifle"". What's the point where a soldier must actively risk their life, and lives of his friend, just in case it isn't a rifle etc.

This is one of the big reasons why evacuation of civilians should be a priority prior to a war, as modern, post industrial, warfare doesn't make a clear distinction between battlefields and civilian infra. Apartment buildings, theatres, restaurants and schools can occupy tactically significant positions (we have video of a hospital being used as a fighting position even in this war).

None of this makes bombing of civilian targets morally right, or lessen the amount and significance of the human suffering, but I'm trying to highlight the general problems of fighting in an urban area amongst civilians, especially when the war you're fighting is a war of conventional force on force.

And even if in some cases there is plausible deniability and impossibility to prove either sides claims correct, these questions do not make the Russian invasion of Ukraine itself any less illegal.

&gt; Although China has so far rejected limits on its nuclear forces by arguing that “Countries with the largest nuclear arsenals [Russia and the United States] have special and primary responsibilities in nuclear disarmament,” the size of the Chinese missile silo program – combined with the other elements of China’s nuclear modernization – could bring China into that category in the not too distant future. With approximately 300 apparent silos under construction  – a number that exceeds the number of ICBM silos operated by Russia – and an additional 100-plus road-mobile ICBM launchers, China’s total ICBM force could potentially exceed that of either Russia and the United States in the foreseeable future.",09009d97f1c7d3a1f0115d33d988b904af604197,True,False,,,,,0,1647498072,,0,{},i0zl2yb,True,t3_tg3k5e,False,True,t3_tg3k5e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tg3k5e/a_closer_look_at_chinas_missile_silo_construction/i0zl2yb/,1647498088,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647469272.0,

That's not clear to me. 20th and 8th CAAs, + the right wing of 58th CAA, have between them \~28 BTGs, which amount to 1/4 of the formations that have entered Ukraine (110 of 117 assigned BTGs).

&gt;The fighting there still seems to be relatively low intensity versus the fighting along Ukraine's high speed corridors.

What is the basis for that assessment?

&gt;That makes sense too since we know that Russia already has logistical difficulties that largely constrain them to the roads.

The logistical constraints appear to be a much greater factor in the north than in the JFO sector.

&gt;Russia committed at least 117 BTGs to this fighting (not to mention additional VDV, Naval Infantry, and paramilitary forces)

The BTG count includes the VDV and Naval Infantry, though.

AFAICT, the initial Russian force breakdown is:

\-Maneuver elements: 117x BTGs = 105,300 personnel

\-Higher HQ and ""tail"" units = 44,700 personnel

\-Rosgvardia and separatist forces (including ""tail"") = 40,000 personnel

&gt;those forces alone outnumber the Ukrainians in terms of armor (that's 1170 MBTs and 4680 AFVs/IFVs/APCs by BTG TO&amp;E)

I get:

\-MBTs: 1,170

\-IFVs/APCs: 3,510

\-Artillery: 702

\-MRLs: 702

Compare with active Ukrainian holdings (not including stored equipment) of:

\-MBTs: 987

\-IFVs/APCs: 2,196

\-Artillery: 1,236

\-MRLs: 360

Save for the IFVs/APCs, those are very similar holdings. Obviously not all Ukrainian assets are engaged against Russian forces, and this doesn't include the holdings of the Rosgvardia and the separatists, but I don't think the material overmatch of the invasion force is overwhelming.",b61ff4aa3af336ffe1cdd438be60e2b4e37bd54a,True,False,,,,,0,1647496619,,0,{},i0zj4hf,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0zf5fq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0zj4hf/,1647496634,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647467819.0,

I don’t know shit but my general feel is that there isn’t a path to victory for Ukraine. 


Assuming we had a peace deal relatively soon say in the next 2 weeks it will favor the Russians as the current assumption of peace talks that the Russians will eventually win. I would guess:

Ukraine cannot enter defensive pacts or house non Russian troops on its territory but maintains a military. Russia gets Crimea, the republics, and a corridor to Crimea. Remaining Ukrainian oblasts gain the more rights over the central government to do things like hold plebiscites to join Russia or be independent. 

Ukraine possibly has its military capped at 100k maybe

General war crimes amnesty just like Minsk with a possible cut out for more notorious Ukrainian national guard units to be tried.

Turnover of all nato supplied hardware. 

New elections called in Ukraine with Russian observers. (Might not be in the deal but will happen)

I doubt we will see a peace deal soon.

I think the East is all over but the crying. After the Russians hope When that happens Kiev will fall soon, the Odessa will be over run quickly and Ukraine will either surrender or fall back far enough that what they control in only the far west Lviv area and effectively are a rump state that soon capitulates without a Lviv fight . If they can hold Kiev open and contest Odessa enough a Ukrainian victory probably doesn’t look like a win but essentially a line of contact ceasefire where the Russians hold what they have and everyone gears up for round 2 just like North Korea and South Korea.

For as long as the conflict lasts.

Arming proxies with all manners of weaponry to fight their rival may be the biggest constant in the US-USSR/Russia relationship post-WWII.

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; That's true in the north and east, but along the JFO frontline this appears to be incorrect.

The JFO frontline also appears to have the least concentration of regular Russian forces. The fighting there still seems to be relatively low intensity versus the fighting along Ukraine's high speed corridors. That makes sense too since we know that Russia already has logistical difficulties that largely constrain them to the roads.

&gt; How true is it that the Russians have vast force overmatch in Ukraine, though?

It is true. 

Russia committed at least 117 BTGs to this fighting (not to mention additional VDV, Naval Infantry, and paramilitary forces), and those forces alone outnumber the Ukrainians in terms of armor (that's 1170 MBTs and 4680 AFVs/IFVs/APCs by BTG TO&amp;E). The bigger difference comes in the expected quality of those forces too. On paper, at least, the Russians were fielding a significantly more modern force than the Ukrainians. We have seen more T-72's than was perhaps expected in this fighting, but if you were the Ukrainians, you would have probably been prudent to expect that equipment facing yours would have been of significantly better quality.

The overmatch gets worse when you consider airpower and fires. On paper, VKS completely outmatched the Ukrainian air force. Hardly anyone seemed to believe the Russians wouldn't have achieved air supremacy, or at least air superiority, by this point in the fighting.

Russia's fires capability also benefits from not just more and newer artillery, but their missile forces are vastly more capable than anything Ukraine has.

The only potential advantage Ukraine had was that they could conceivably mobilize a larger force than the Russians, so long as they had time for a general mobilization and the Russians weren't prepared to do the same. This would mean fighting a heavily mechanized force with primarily poorly-trained light infantry though. There's only one environment where poorly-trained light infantry can reasonably hope to fight a mechanized force with air and fire superiority, and it helps that the forces being mobilized would largely be concentrated in those same areas by default. It seems reasonable that this has been Ukraine's strategy from the get-go.",cc2273ce160231b59d12774cb4b7ad19d002c94d,True,False,,,,,0,1647493902,,0,{},i0zf5fq,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0ybu3u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0zf5fq/,1647493914,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647465102.0,

Economy's arguably more problematic from a geopolitical perspective than sheer population -- you can wield power like China if you're big and rich even if most of your people are poor, or you can punch above your weight if you're small and rich because you can allocate more to defense and aid.

That's not quite correct. The Russian figure of \~190,000 men is only for **ground forces**, whereas the total manpower of the active Ukrainian **Armed Forces** amounts to \~200,000 men (and not \~250,000 - see IISS ""*The Military Balance*"", 2022 edition).

Ukraine's ground component amounts to 151,600 men, and unlike Russia this includes higher command structures, higher rear services, training establishments, etc. This also includes a few major formations kept in Western Ukraine to guard against surprises coming from Belarus or Transnistria.

At the onset of the invasion, Ukraine probably had \~100,000 men in its in-theater ground component, facing off against a force almost twice its size. That force, however, was committed piecemeal, which blunted the initial shock and provided the UA with opportunities for small-unit ambushes.

Ukraine has since initiated mobilization, and its Territorial Defense Brigades have bolstered eastern Ukraine with tens of thousands of additional light infantry. More Territorial Defense units are currently mobilizing behind the front. These units, however, lack motorization and heavy weapons, and can really only be used in static - ideally urban - warfare.

If Russia succeeds at cutting off the forces of the JFO, it will eliminate a significant portion of Ukraine's conventional military power.",8a2f81f7f893f83b38c28e5927ee9a85cb202f44,True,False,,,,,0,1647488828,,0,{},i0z655n,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0ynseu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0z655n/,1647488843,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647460028.0,

For a start, these weren't organic rebellions. They were instigated and organized by Russia, supported with Russian irregulars and materiel, and on several occasions sustained through direct interventions by the Russian military.

Then, there's the fact that much of the area claimed by these ""rebels"" wasn't actually controlled by them until Russia's invasion. That includes lands that until recently contained *millions* of Ukrainian citizens and cities like Mariupol.

[],False,,prometheus2508,,,[],,,,text,t2_7rb27,False,False,"It's...sort of hard to answer specifically. From an air combat radar perspective, minimum detection ranges are pushed further out the longer a specific ""pulse"" is transmitted (assuming your transmitter and receiver is the same object). This is because the receiver has to be decoupled from the antenna to not get burned out by the massive power the transmitter has relative to the receiver's sensitivity. With round trip time, of the leading edge of a pulse going out and coming back, you can calculate a minimum range.

So that means that any technique has to exist in ""chunks"" and a receiver only has to detect those chunks in whole. They would probably be on the order of milliseconds. So ""listening time"" isn't really a concern. Processing power is of concern, but it's going to be dependent on what you want to do with the signal. Simply recording it is important if you want to take that info back home for analysis. Being able to ID, process, and do any kind of EW technique would definitely require some computational beef, but this can be mitigated if the platform knows *roughly* what it's looking for.

But there are Electronic Protection techniques that can be used to place limits on what can be done with ""accurate"" detections of an LPI waveform. Again, this is generically speaking. LPI could simply be reducing transmit power to some minimum required power, preventing a third party from ""hearing"" simply based on physics, and processing power isn't going to crack that nut.",b9b868f8b6e52123bfe07f2f016e3577655134c7,True,False,,,,,0,1647483113,,0,{},i0yubq8,False,t3_tfnt4a,False,True,t1_i0ysl4f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfnt4a/how_do_you_intercept_lpi_radar_and_radio/i0yubq8/,1647483126,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647454313.0,

\-WIA: 14,000 - 21,000

\-POW: 500 - 600 (different source used: [Zelensky himself](https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/zelensky-says-500-600-russian-soldiers-taken-prisoner/), albeit from 4 days ago)

They are also sending [additional reserves](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/273677714945314) from the Far East.

&gt;	WASHINGTON — In 36 days of fighting on Iwo Jima during World War II, nearly 7,000 Marines were killed. Now, 20 days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia invaded Ukraine, his military has already lost more soldiers, according to American intelligence estimates.

&gt;	The conservative side of the estimate, at more than 7,000 Russian troop deaths, is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.

&gt;	It is a staggering number amassed in just three weeks of fighting, American officials say, with implications for the combat effectiveness of Russian units, including soldiers in tank formations. Pentagon officials say a 10 percent casualty rate, including dead and wounded, for a single unit renders it unable to carry out combat-related tasks.

&gt;	With more than 150,000 Russian troops now involved in the war in Ukraine, Russian casualties, when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level. And the Russian military has also lost at least three generals in the fight, according to Ukrainian, NATO and Russian officials.
