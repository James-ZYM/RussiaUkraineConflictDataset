I guess your experience in operational conduct of enforcing a no fly zone is extensive and your understanding of Russian political culture is very extensive. I guess you have sat down with Putin and understand what his end state goals are and how he expects to achieve it or should I say expected to.

Or in fact the factors that may still see involvement?
You do understand the different COA in regards to no fly zones I assume?
You do know that many factors impact on decisions yeah not just oh my god nukes?
You do know that even the best laid plans go out the window at H hour or first contact?
You do understand things like MAP (military appreciation process )? I assume you have spent years studying military tactics and those of what has been perceived the greatest threat the Russian military well until recently when the shift went towards counter terror etc? 
I really hope you haven’t pinned all your knowledge to a text book that explains what happens in the event a nuclear war could or would occur?
I really hope you not so narrow minded that you believe Putins plan was to take as much as he can or just Ukraine even and if someone gets involved I’ll start firing nuclear weapons because it’s a sure thing that a nuclear response would occur and dam the world? You don’t just come up with one theory and call it quits do you?
Surely you don’t believe Putin thought his BS would deter NATO forces involvement or for that matter he didn’t think they would be far more involved by now or immediately?
Surely his statements in regards to their already involvement being an act of war was good enough to trigger nuclear war but no only that pesky no fly zone they do that and attempt to enforce it in anyway and that’s it I’ll fire?
The only fool here is you sitting back stating one COA or response to a possible action by way of worst case scenario or as you put it Rhetoric fear munger. You are such the scientist and superior tactician. 
Or should I say a possible Ally propagandist of Russia?
Well your one track thought process is doing more good for them than it is for the rest of the world.
For you to sit back and assume those who don’t share your opinions don’t understand the implications or what a global nuclear war would result in.

And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.

,[],False,,idealatry,,,[],,,,text,t2_wt4n1,False,False,"I think Vladimir Putin is an authoritarian and if not a fascist, certainly smells like one. He committed an abysmal international crime by invading Ukraine, and there is no moral justification whatsoever for that.

BUT, we have to be realistic. The reason this happened was because Russia viewed Ukrainian NATO membership as an existentially threatening issue.  After Ukraine applied in 2008 and the US forced other NATO members to say Ukraine would be admitted, this caused a series of events, including an enormous protest, an alleged coup, Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the whole Donbas conflict. These things are not unrelated, and there's plenty of smart people who understand this is the driving factor that caused the conflict. 

So we can do one of two things.

We can either stand on principle, fold our arms across our chest, and say ""come hell or high-water, I am doing this,"" which will have no meaningful change in NATO's own policy to now refuse Ukrainian admission (which has been true since 2014), and it will tell Vladimir Putin that Ukraine will remain defiant and he will be compelled to wreck the country.

Or, we can be realistic, and understand that NATO admission is literally impossible at this point, and we can say Ukraine should be a neutral state like Finland or Austria. Or in other words, exactly how independent Ukraine was before 2014 (minus some territories). 

By the way, if you haven't researched it, you should understand the FULL events of Euromaidan, and how that led to an ethnic-based civil conflict which led us to the present conflict. This helps explains Putin's rhetoric to some degree. And it shows you, most importantly that ...

Putin is not Adolph Hitler. 

He's not. I'm sorry, but he's really not. The comparisons fail for many reasons, but two of the biggest ones off the top of my head are: Hitler had an army of 16 million and the most advanced economy in the world, and Putin has less than one million men and a failing economy. Furthermore Russia grows weaker by the year as their fatal demographic plunge remains terminal and shows no signs of abating. In other words Russia is fucked now or later. Putin's rhetoric is also quite different than Hitler's, and it seems his motivations in Ukraine are largely driven by NATO, EU, and Donbas issues -- NOT exterminating an ethnic group. You mentioned his use of the word ""purify"" but he does not mean that in an ethnic sense, he's talking to Russians who are resisting Putin's authoritarian rule and he's saying he wants to ""purify"" Russia by getting rid of Western ideals.

Saying Putin is Hitler is an extremely dangerous thing to do, because I believe it's the US media trying to drive everyone into a rage and convincing everyone that a compromise is not possible -- but in fact there is every reason to believe it is possible.",fc4b92b82a4923001f56539694cc94907cf4e49b,True,False,,,,,0,1647552087,,0,{},i12laig,False,t3_tfocc0,False,True,t1_i12da06,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tfocc0/why_we_hate_politicians_all_talk_no_action/i12laig/,1647552102,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647523287.0,,,,

,[],False,,idealatry,,,[],,,,text,t2_wt4n1,False,False,"Well, contrary to the US narrative, I actually don't think Putin is a madman. He's an authoritarian and he is now a war criminal (he joins a long list of recent US leaders in that regard), but I think his aims were fairly rational.

It all stems from the 2008 decision to admit Ukraine to NATO, and following that the 2014 Maidan protest, which was a coup in Putin's eyes and arguably a coup in reality. That's when he annexed Crimea to save Russian control Sevastopol Naval base, the following war in Donbas, etc. It all comes from the same thing. So I really think that means there's room to negotiate a reasonable end to this conflict. I think it could have been negotiated even earlier BEFORE the conflict, but spilled milk and all that.

The problem is, as far as I can tell, one major component to a peace deal would be the US blessing on it. And unfortunately, it's so political toxic to suggest anyone make a deal with Putin that domestic politics makes it seem impossible. That's incredibly frustrating to me personally because I've been screaming and tearing. my hair out about how we need to stop treating Putin like Hitler and make a fucking deal with this jackass. Like him or not, we have to live on the same planet. We have to coexist. And I want Ukraine to exist in that reality as well.

Regarding Hitler with nuclear weapons -- well, that has crossed my mind more than a few times during this crisis. What if a totalitarian leader decides to hold the world hostage with nukes?I don't know any way to stop that other than getting serious about nuclear non-proliferation (a piece that we abandoned under Trump when we dropped out of the Intermediate Range nuclear missile treaty, over Putin's objections). I think we need to make a push for non-proliferation during peacetime, obviously it's impossible in times of crisis. Also I think having better relations and being more open and honest with the world is a good thing.

At the same time, the CCP also has an obsessive wish for China to be seen favorably by the international community. They expend a tremendous amount of effort in ""soft power"", trying to convince the world that their crimes are fictional and that China under CCP rule is a wonderful country to be admired by all.

But, as far as nuclear war goes, I think we have to make a few assumptions: a madman (at work) or an ENORMOUS dickhead (at best) has control over a fairly vast nuclear arsenal.

We have to concede that there are things Putin could do short of attacking US soil or that of formally allied countries that would warrant a military (non-nuclear) response.

Sir, we must do more to help Ukraine! Since when do we negotiate with terrorists like Putin? Is that the American way? Our war of words will do nothing to stop the actual war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have the spirit of our founding fathers running through their brave hearts. Great men like General George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, their fight for our freedom, liberty and independence echos the struggle of Ukraine. In our War for independence we would not have been able to achieve victory without the assistance of the French. We need to be ""the French"" for Ukraine right now. If Putin is not stopped he will continue his bloody war beyond Ukraine just as he has in his past. Ukraine must be defended and Putin must be stopped. The balance of the free word is at stake, we are the only nation with the people and the power to do what need to be done to stop this. Yet we sit idly by doing nothing of consequence. The United States, our allies and our way of life is at stake. Just because Russian tanks are not in Poland or Portland right now does not mean that we are safe. We must utilize our military power to end this bloodshed. Please Urge President Biden and your fellow Congress men and women that action is necessary. Our enemies our empowered by our displayed weakness on the world stage by letting a war criminal run rampant and cowering at his pathetic threats and demands. We do no negotiate with terrorists.

&gt;What do these two stories (that we know of) teach us? The entire narrative of rockets that would ""fly automatically"" is a myth. It's a bluff aimed to maximise the nuclear deterrence effect. No sane commandment would ever do this considering how unreliable these systems are  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, there is a reason to believe that several independent mechanisms prevent some hothead from just launching rockets because he feels like that. That would explain why in 1962 decision to launch torpedoes was blocked both by military and political higher-ups

Ok, these are **utterly foolish** conclusions. Ridiculous. Reckless. 

This guy took two examples of where we came one officer's decision away from launching a nuclear war and his conclusion was ""nobody would ever do it."" That is fucking dumb, man. He neglects to mention that in the Arkhipov case, two others humans actually DID vote to launch the nuclear strike! In the other case, we have one human who didn't. So cumulatively, we have when it came down to launching a retaliatory strike, a total of 2 people out of 4 (a pathetic sample size for a study, to be sure) which is a 50% chance! 

I'm constantly appalled at the current narrative that many internet people seem to be pushing that we should actually attack Russia because they would not do a counter strike because of bullshit arguments like the above ones.

Even taking account that there is reasonable suspicion about the validity of opinionated polls; I’d still agree a bunch of people would in fact want some kind of direct intervention regardless of the inevitable chaos. 

War is self evidently the worst option available, to say Nuclear war would call about the end of existence is far too optimistic. It would simply plunge us into a new era of unimaginable suffering, and (much like 1984) the preexisting states would have never existed to the forthcoming generations. They would never be able to comprehend why they live in such a world, or why the way it is. That is my personal perception of the outcome of a nuclear war.

&gt; pressing on the emotional gas pedal 

Most definitely, it genuinely is quite worrying how many people are jumping on emotive impulses, I mean unsurprising but still worrying. Because as i'm sure you'll be aware this is kinda side show at the moment. It's still the early stages, I can't imagine the war will go on long, but it can get so much more nastier than this. Imagine how people are gonna react when we start getting the kind of stories and images that came out of Syria, what the emotional impulse going to be then?  


There was a podcast I was listening to recently by Modern War Institute (pretty sure it was their last one on No Fly Zones), 

  
https://castbox.fm/episode/Understanding-No-Fly-Zones-id2493454-id475105594?country=gb  
and I can't remember all the exact numbers but essentially there was polling done in USA recently, and it found that a majority of Americans absolutely did not want boots on the ground in Ukraine, but a similar majority did want a No Fly Zone enforced....

&gt;Ok champion you have done well I mean **other than sound like a lunatic** with a one tracked mind you have done well. 

Well so says you but we've already established you don't know what you're talking about so.  


&gt;Can I suggest something

Sure

&gt; instead of getting so wound up and jumping down peoples throats that you stay calm and attempt to explain your findings, opinions and knowledge?

Well I did explain it, thoroughly, you instead decided to set the tone ""champ"", and I responded in kind, and rather than address those points, you've long since abandoned it in favour of your perceived moral high ground on the conduct of debate. Eg  


&gt; People maybe far more receiving of you. 

I genuinely, do not, give a shit, for your perceived grievance. You started off repeating rhetoric that you clearly don't understand, and you did patronisingly, without even a shred of self awareness or irony. You're clearly an idiot. And I genuinely don't give a fuck for idiots.  


&gt; Also never judge someone you don’t know they may have something to offer no matter how small

lol hahaha, look at you boy trying to attempt wisdom. GTFO here you clown XD  


&gt;Because guess what and this may surprise you the way you have carried on makes you come across like an authoritarian dictator who is so caught up in their own importance taking pleasure in making them self feel good belittling others.

HAHAHA oh you are definitely emasculated arnt you. Just, pure lols at your emotive exaggerations. Pretty clear whos getting a bit upset over this. Just fuck off already and read an article or two rather than just headlines and memes.

errr Im getting more confident he'll use a WMD in Ukraine, he's completely and utterly fucked it up. Chemical seems likely, the precedent has already been set in Syria, maybe dirty bomb or a nuke but I think that's highly unlikely. And it would only be targeted at Ukraine, certainly not a NATO country.

&gt;And why is a no fly zone the catalyst for that?

Because a no fly zone is literally what it says it is. You fly, you die. NATO countries, shooting down Russian jets... Theres no ambiguity left anymore, NATO countries are warring with Russia. Once that point is reached it's only a matter of time before Nukes start getting exchanged.

&gt;And just because I don’t get on reddit and spew my opinions on here like a novel of expertise like yourself does not mean I haven’t put any thought into it.

Well the fact that you're using the highly parroted line:

I mean, I have only seen two types of people say this, specific politicians who have an interest in saying this, and general people who obviously dont understand what say, a nuclear winter is, or say strategies like, Mutually Assured Destruction.

I mean lets be honest, sorry, the fact you're even asking **why does No Fly Zone mean nuclear exchange** sorry. Anyone who understands this knows this means nuclear war. It was literally the same conversation that was being had over Syria almost a decade ago, You know why we didnt enforce a no fly zone over Syria?

Yea... in NON NATO countries........ has the penny dropped yet?  


&gt;I point at China and North Korea as examples of how you can subjugate a large population. 

Of course you can look at plenty examples throughout history, but the nuance you're avoiding here is utilizing that subjugated population to do something like.... invade a country. People can be subjugated through fear nut when you start forcing them to lay down their lives for you.... well.... you might start getting the kind of stalled effects we're witnessing right now...  


&gt;China took Tibet 

Yea they did, not with an all out war though...   


&gt;and **attempted** to take Vietnam.

Yea....  and how did that go?  


&gt;They are very vocal in their desire to take the ROC as well as building military presences on the territory of other nations.

Ok but Ive yet to see how this is relevant to what we're talking about.  


&gt;We can put our head in the sand or **we can do something.** 

And we are, providing weapons, logistics, relief, intelligence, accepting refugees, economic sanctions.... I mean, theres certainly more debate to be had about whether they go far enough.... OR TOO FAR.  


But enforcing a no fly zone is LITERALLY ENTERING THE WAR..... I feel like there's a massive elephant in the room that you're having contemplating the size of.  


You're literally saying, out of fear Putin will do something ie ""conquer the world"", something he has never stated and something that has never been done, and lets be honest, something that is clearly fantasy. Out of fear of that fantasy..... lets literally end the human species.... I mean. Again, sorry if this is the first war you've looked at, but get ready for it to be far, far nastier than this. We're still in the childplay stages.  


&gt;what exactly will be different **next time?**

lol *next time*, again, welcome to history, this isnt the first time this kind of thing has happened and it certainly wont be the last.  


&gt;Why would he stop if it’s working?

...Because it's not working? Where are you getting your info? You do realise militarily Puting looks pretty fucked here don't you? I mean sure theyve got lots of firepower, can still flatten the country, but they clearly CAN'T take it!

Have you paid attention to any major city battles in history?  Putin has clearly, completely and utterly fucked this up. So if he can't even take major cities in Ukraine, what fucking chance does he have of conquering ""the world"".   


&gt;My question for you is at what point would it be viable to try to stop Russia?

At no point.  


&gt; If they decide tomorrow to just nuke the Ukraine to dust and roll in would it still not be viable to intervene?

Nope.  


All up for providing support of every variety, supporting refugees, applying economic punishments and any variety of restrictions on Russia.

Hard to tell  


&gt;Look at China and North Korea. It’s more than possible to subjugate a country and fold it in.

Into what major wars have these populations been rallied?   


Saying something like ""look at China and North Korea"" when their societies are so opaque. Noone really knows what going on internally with these populations.   


&gt;Just because a view is simplistic does not make it wrong.

What view is this you're talking about?  


&gt;Russia did **the same** in Chechnya and a great deal of them now fight on Russia’s side.

the same as what? as what they're doing in Ukraine? No not really, Georgia is a far better comparison.  


&gt;Russia has nukes yes but so do we, if you allow fear of nukes to prevent you from doing any sort of intervention than we can basically surrender to China and Russia now.

That was literally what we were doing for the past 80 fucking years to avoid nuclear war.... what, exactly, is different now?  


&gt; Because eventually it will be the same scenario over and over. If your unwilling now you will be unwilling then.

Which is why Russia took over the world decades ago... Sorry but it seems to me an AWFUL amount of people paying attention to this topic, know nothing of history, infact no nothing of war, despite the plenty of examples just in the last few years over our lifetime. You do realise this is the EXACT same issue as was in Syria? Of course the war is completely different but the issue around No Fly Zone is the same. There were chemical weapons and bombing campaigns that eclipse what is currently happening in Ukraine, we still didnt enforce a no fly zone there..... because it means WW3 for fucks sake....  


&gt;The very concept of saying you will not intervene because of the nuclear threat is what allows these invasions to happen.

It literally isnt which is why Russia has never attacked a NATO country... again you're talking like you've just entered this topic thats been well discussed for decades.  


&gt;MAD only works if both sides are honest and willing to use them.

No it only works if you're dealing with rational actors.  


&gt;As soon as one side says they won’t it stops being a deterrent. 

Whos said that, noone said that? We're talking about initiating a no fly zone, IE, if this isnt clear to you, FIRING THE FIRST SHOTS IN WW3. Ukraine is NOT a NATO country...

Im pretty sure they know exactly what they would use them for.

Even if they had more planes than pilots that would be good. Better cycling of planes for maintenance schedules, more airframes than pilots means your trained pilots can fly more on reliable jets. 

1:1 pilots to jets is horrible for endurance. Any mechanical failure that grounds a plane becomes a reduction in force. Even mechanical upkeep is a problem because you cant standby a pilot without a matching airworthy craft. 

More planes than pilots decouples the scheduling of service cycles and pilots.",dc62702d879602c8b9370b3e4cf9086b1eda762d,True,False,,,,,0,1647483166,,0,{},i0yufox,False,t3_tfocc0,False,True,t1_i0x2jfy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tfocc0/why_we_hate_politicians_all_talk_no_action/i0yufox/,1647483177,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647454366.0,,,,

They don’t want to deal with the currency conversions when Russia is looking to restrict currency exchanges. They don’t want to violate international sanctions.

&gt; The misinformation, on Russian Embassy Twitter, Facebook and Telegram accounts, circulated even after Twitter Inc(TWTR.N) and Meta Platform&amp;#039;s Facebook took down posts from the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom for breaking their rules against denying violent events, an Israeli watchdog found.

&gt; The posts on official Russian social media accounts claimed reports of the bombing were a hoax.
