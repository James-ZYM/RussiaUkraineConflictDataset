The first step in the Uniting for Ukraine process is for the U.S.-based supporter to file a Form I-134(OP post link above), Declaration of Financial Support, with USCIS. The supporter will then be vetted by the U.S. government to ensure that they are able to financially support the individual whom they agree to support.

##What to Expect After the Form I-134 is Filed

After the supporter files the Form I-134 with USCIS, we will review the form and supporting evidence to ensure that the supporter has sufficient financial resources to support the Ukrainian beneficiary for the duration of the parole period and conduct background checks on the supporter. We will determine whether the Form I-134 is sufficient, and we may request additional evidence to make our determination. If approved, Ukrainian beneficiaries will receive an email from USCIS with instructions on how to set up an account with myUSCIS and other next steps. Individuals should check their emails including spam and junk folders for important messages from USCIS.

##If the Form I-134 is Sufficient

If we confirm the Form I-134 is sufficient, the Ukrainian beneficiary will receive an email from USCIS with instructions on how to set up an account with myUSCIS and other next steps.  The Ukrainian beneficiary will be required to confirm their biographic information on myUSCIS and attest to completion of all requirements including:               

An attestation to certify understanding of the family relationship requirements for children under 18 for Uniting for Ukraine.
An attestation that you have completed vaccine requirements or are eligible for an exception to vaccine requirements for Measles, Polio, and the first dose of an FDA approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccine or a WHO-Emergency use listed (EUL) COVID-19 vaccine.
Upon arrival to the United States, the beneficiary will need to attest to receiving a medical screening for tuberculosis, including an Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) test, within 14 days.
More information on vaccine requirements can be found on the preview of the vaccine attestation page. 
If the Form I-134 is Insufficient

If we are unable to confirm the Form I-134 is sufficient, that decision is final. The Ukrainian beneficiary will receive an email from USCIS notifying them that the Form I-134 filed on their behalf was determined to be insufficient. The Ukrainian beneficiary will not be considered for parole under Uniting for Ukraine based on the insufficient Form I-134. However, the supporter may file a new Form I-134 on behalf of the same or another Ukrainian beneficiary, or a different supporter may file a Form I-134 on behalf of the beneficiary

Authorization to travel to the United States

Once the Ukrainian beneficiary has confirmed their biographic information and attested to completing all other requirements, their case will be further processed. Ukrainians will receive an email instructing them to check their myUSCIS account for the result of their authorization to travel. If the individual has been authorized to travel to the United States to seek parole pursuant to the Uniting for Ukraine process, they will be responsible to arrange and fund their own travel. This authorization is valid for a period of 90 days.",4c598d793e95e52d06569d9623044e442d04db1b,True,False,,,,,0,1650923945,,0,{},i66r1wk,True,t3_ubwmh0,False,True,t3_ubwmh0,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ubwmh0/if_you_are_american_you_can_afford_to_sponsor_a/i66r1wk/,1650923957,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650895145.0,

*****
&gt; The parliaments of Latvia and Estonia have voted unanimously to recognise Russian actions in Ukraine as &amp;#039;genocide&amp;#039;.

&gt; The move is likely to increase tensions even further between Russia and the Baltic states following Russia&amp;#039;s illegal invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February, which is now in its third month and shows no sign of coming to an end.

&gt; The move by the parliaments comes not long after US President Joe Biden used the term genocide to refer to actions in Ukraine.
