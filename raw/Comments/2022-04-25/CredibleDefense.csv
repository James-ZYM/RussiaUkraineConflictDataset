They won’t mass mobilize to defend Crimea they will mobilize for a perceived grander threat to Russia as a whole. One of the things that Russian society is very scared of is the threat to the nation (*not the state*). This is why their are huge surges in the popularity of Putin following the 2nd Chechen war, and the annexation of crimea. Support for the annexation was not apparent before the Maidan revolution however after it was. This is because the maidan revolution presented a radical change to the geopolitical support of Russia. Many Russians were in fact very wary of a pro EU Ukraine not for political reason but because of the long ingrained belief of existential threat inherited from the “great Patriotic war” and the Cold War that followed. While many believe in a large apolitical, cynical population this is a largely western perception. I have a friend who studied Russian Language and IR in st Petersburg and operates as a mediator between Russian and western businesses. He often alludes to the idea while a lot of Russian civilians are not supportive of the regime many are still incredibly nationalistic and defensive. It is a society that has long held the belief of repressed grandeur often at the hands of the west.

The mobilization I think of is not one of mobilizing an army but of mobilizing a civilian population to support the war. Think of the UK during the blitz. This mobilization does not mean a better equipped or stronger army but a society that is more willing to accept escalation of conflict in the face of a larger threat. This present a problem for the west in the same way the German civilian population did in WW2. The German army was largely crushed and outmatched by 1943 but the population still allowed it to sustain a war effort that lead to the destruction of Europe during its defeat. A more weary population would have pressured a peace treaty much earlier during the especially with the US and UK if it hadn’t had such a strong degree of psychological mobilization.",a1f7e5613b5fd3a1b4877e5c7f2af8625767c713,True,False,,,,,0,1650930485,,0,{},i67636m,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,True,t1_i673bjy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i67636m/,1650930501,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650901685.0

I mean, it's possible the visual disturbance could have come from a reload, though the firing tubes are on a separate module to the optics and they are gyro stabilised. Causing that much wobble for that long from a reload seems a little unlikely. 

Moving the entire platform on undulating ground, coupled with engagement magnification seems more probable for the disturbance in my estimation. 

Could be wrong through. 

As for the distance travelled relocating, again, without knowing the engagement range and cover they were firing from, I can't really estimate how far they moved. 



&gt; think the fact that we saw total paralysis as a response to 4 missile hits 

I don't think we saw enough to determine that with any degree of certainty. The RCWS pivots to some degree between targets, somewhat obstructing FOV of the previous target engaged. Add in the fact that the targets were in cover and ascertaining actions on becomes difficult. 

As for threat detection systems, acoustic or otherwise, yes, some modern platforms are equipped with them. Some are not. It all depends on what was being engaged and how proficient the fielded system was, if any were present. 

Based on previous videos of engagements  between Russian and Ukranian forces, the Russian Usage of mechanised and armoured units is, to be frank, odd and their actions on appear a little anaemic with minimum extrication and at times no movement at all. 

It could, however, be exactly as you described.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces resumed ground attacks against Mariupol’s Azovstal Steel Plant in the last 24 hours. Russian officers may assess they will be unable to starve out the remaining defenders by May 9 (a possible self-imposed deadline to complete the capture of Mariupol). Russian forces will likely take high casualties if they resume major ground assaults to clear the facility.  
Russian forces are accelerating efforts to secure occupied Mariupol but will likely face widespread Ukrainian resistance.  
Continued Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine took little to no additional territory in the past 24 hours.  
Prudent tactical Ukrainian counterattacks around Izyum are likely impeding Russian efforts to complete even tactical encirclements of Ukrainian forces.  
Russian forces are preparing for renewed attacks to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine after minor losses in the past 48 hours.  
Russian forces likely conducted a false flag attack in Transnistria (Russia’s illegally occupied territory in Moldova) to amplify Russian claims of anti-Russian sentiment in Moldova, but Transnistrian forces remain unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate items to watch**

That would depend on the terms of the deal. If it was a good deal for Ukraine they probably wouldn't need pressuring.

Interests do clearly diverge though. For instance, Ukraine has an interest in starting a shooting war between the U.S. and Russia as soon as possible (and asked for one repeatedly in the form of a no-fly zone); the U.S. has an interest in avoiding that.

The only scenario where I think the U.S. **might** pressure the Ukrainians to go to the table is somewhere far down the road where, very hypothetically here, Ukraine has retaken the invaded lands and wants to invade Crimea, but the U.S. believes Russia will use nuclear weapons to defend Crimea.

Germany and Japan both had decades long occupations and a total rebuilding of their entire political system from the ground-up by their occupiers (for the better I think you could safely say). WW2 is kind of unusual as far as conflicts go - most don't end with total destruction and decades long occupation. Japan is also.. interesting to say the least - hasn't the LDP essentially run the country since 1955 almost continuously? Bit of an odd democracy if you ask me but then again my familiarity with Japanese politics is poor. 

South Korea is actually an interesting point. South Korea post-war was a dictatorship for roughly two decades post-war and while Park's rulership was not exactly the authoritarian hellscape to the north, I don't think you can argue that SK was a model of post-war governance. Israel also shows some interesting characteristics of how the pressures of war can warp domestic politics and produce pressures that lead to unfavourable outcomes. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds here, but my point is basically that democracies have difficulty surviving conflicts. France post WW2 is a great example (although to be fair, French politics always looks terrible to outsiders). Post WW1 Germany, pst-war Vietnam and Cambodia, and even to an extent America during the GWOT all exhibit the interplay between political institutions and war. It's not necessarily a direct path of war = dictatorship and bad outcomes, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find an example of a war that *strengthened* democracy. 

&gt;How many of those had internal struggles or an ethnically/religiously un cohesive populations (balkans, Arab states, conflicts in Africa)?

The nature of conflict is such that it tends to arise in areas with precisely those characteristics. I would argue that Ukraine is less united than one might get a picture of from Western media. The war may actually erase those divides (as often is the case) but it is a system with a *lot* of corruption, factionalism, wealth inequality, and is no stranger to political violence.

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,[],,,,text,t2_dg31a,False,False,"Speaking of Transnistria, Strelkov posted this two days ago. He fought in Transnistria, so he must have some local sources:  

&gt;
According to private sources - Romania is making covert preparations for war. A large number of Romanian soldiers and officers are introduced into Moldova under the guise of ""Moldovan military"". In particular, a considerable number of Moldovan officers are replaced by Romanian army officers (at all key positions) at all headquarters and the commandant companies of military units (fulfilling the functions of the military police) - the personnel are replaced by Romanians in their entirety.  

&gt;The warehouses of the military uniforms and boots (especially the latter), NATO army rations and other auxiliary military equipment are hastily created and filled from the outside in the territory of Moldova. But not weapons. The sources assume that there is no need for arms delivery, because when the Romanian army takes over Moldova, it ""will come with all its own"", and the mobilization of the Moldovans, most likely, either is not planned at all, or will be of auxiliary nature.  

 And today:  
&gt; 
&gt; Information about the joint preparation of the Romanian-Ukrainian coalition for the ""zachistka"" of Transnistria has received additional confirmation.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to the Moldovan army units, staffed by the Romanian personnel, mentioned in my previous post on this subject - there is information about the preparation of entire military units on the territory of Romania proper and already disguised in Moldovan military uniforms. There is also information about the concentration of Ukrainian units and subunits on the border with Transnistria.
&gt; ""The interest"" of the Ukrainian military command is not only a ""political and propagandistic flick on the nose of the Kremlin"", but also has quite practical purposes: the seizure of the ammunition storage base in Kolbasna, which still contains a fairly large amount of ammunition for Soviet-made artillery systems.
&gt; 
&gt; The Moldovan authorities and military are openly afraid of the war and do not even particularly hide their fear. But if (or rather, when) the command comes, absolutely no one will ask them.
&gt; 
&gt; The Transnistrian army has no chances to maintain itself without outside support in case of attack from both sides (which is exactly what is planned and Nazi Governor of Odessa region Marchenko has already hinted at) - not by a long shot. And the Russian Armed Forces are unable to help Transnistria with anything, except, perhaps, a number of missile launches at infrastructure facilities.

For oil thats just not true.

Oil comes in tankers, and terminals don't care where the tankers set off from. Replacing Russian oil is the easy bit. I'd expect europe to have russian oil imports down to a relative trickle in about 12m or so. 

Gas, you have a better point concerning, thats expensive to bring by tanker and usually requires pipelines. They take much longer to arrange than sending your tankers south to the Saudi's/west to the Americans rather than East to Russia.

However, even here I'd expect Russian exports to drop drastically in a year or two.... circa 50%..... and the pipeline issue cuts both ways. Russia can't easily send that anywhere else for sale either. I expect it'll take a few years longer to choke off the remainder, but even so they're going to lose a lot of that volume over 12m.

Its very unclear to me that (regardless of any other sanctions) whether the russian economy can sustain the export losses it can expect in the next 12m.

Losing all that oil and gas revenue is going to put them on the brink, even if they are still receiving 50% or so of pre-war EU sales.

Even today, they are losing huge chunks of oil revenue from the fact that Urals went from selling with -$1-2 of Brent spot price.....to today -$34 of Brent spot price.... as traders decline to buy it (even with no oil sanctions).

Russian breakeven is around $65 and although Brent price is $102 Urals now trades at $68. They'e barely making money on what they're selling now, at volume. 

God knows what happens to Ru revenues when its being sold just a few dollars ahead of costs.... and they lose 80-90%+ of their european sales.",467c0e0dfd8e148bc94dc91af64c876b6b7c054e,True,False,,,,,0,1650921671,,0,{},i66linw,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,True,t1_i66cwag,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i66linw/,1650921689,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650892871.0

&gt;In the separatist-held areas, opinion was more splintered. Forty-nine percent said they wanted to be part of the Russian Federation, with a roughly equal proportion saying they wanted to be a special autonomous region or just an ordinary part of Russia. On both sides of the line of contact, fewer than 10 percent supported independence. Almost 1 in 5 respondents — on both sides of the line of control — said they did not know.

Worth noting is that poll results vary drastically based on whether the phone call was from a Russian or Ukrainian phone number:

&gt;While the Ukrainian and Russian pollsters found similar opinions in areas controlled by the Ukrainian government, in the breakaway area, pollsters calling from Russia found higher support (70 percent) for joining Donbas with Russia than did the pollsters calling from Ukraine (16 percent).

Russia remains the 3rd largest oil producer in the world (if I'm not mistaken) and removing Russian production from European markets is going to be a decades long process that manifests in complex ways throughout Europe (German industrial reliance on Russian energy, for example).

Since you don’t care if the waves are bouncing back like the broadcaster does, ranges on them are much larger. More advanced (were talking like 1960-70s tech here) receivers can help you classify based on type based on the power and frequency of the radars being used. 

Then it’s a matter of waiting and watching and plotting. A smart AD commander will not have every radar powered every minute of every day. In fact the smart commander will run only his AWACS and a very limited number of ground radars for normal operation. But, Russia struggles with AWACS. Anyway if you leave the same radar powered all day every day, a single HARM could throw the entire network into temporary disarray. So the solution is some combination of powering up and down different radars, as well as moving radars physically around the region. Here’s where it gets fun tho: no military can ever be purely random. Orders have to be cut, plans have to be developed, procedure have to be followed to the letter. If you’re smart and patient, and especially if you’re enemy is lazy, you can tract movements and patterns to figure try and anticipate the enemy’s plans and where they might station AD next. Maybe they have five or six prepared positions and every day the radars move in a Star pattern through the positions. Neat. Clean. Understandable. Military. But after a week your enemy has figured out the keys to the castle.

I know that the navy still revolves around carrier groups, but I have some questions about this. I feel like the US has used carriers more as portable airfields than vehicles of naval warfare — has an F-18 ever fired at a ship? When WWII started, battleships could hit targets from 20 miles away. On the other hand, naval aviators could hit targets 200 miles away. Hence, aircraft carriers became the foundation of the navy. But today, cruise missiles can hit targets from, what, 1000 miles away? Are aircraft carriers still the best weapon against destroyers and cruisers? How could carriers take out targets whose missiles have such great range? For that matter, would destroyers fire at one another, and victory would come down to your radar and missiles' range?

I'm also curious about the role of submarines. It's my understanding that even diesel-powered and battery-powered submarines are very elusive. How much damage could they do to a carrier group before being sunk? In Desert Storm, the US showed how sophisticated modern aircraft could obliterate a peer at almost now cost to itself.

&gt; Russia has used about 70% of its arsenal of high-precision missiles, although the country is able to produce them independently.

&gt;""They have about 30% of what they started the war with. There is also the question: who is operating these missiles? After all, the resource that can work with these missiles is also limited. Our intelligence suggests this is about 30 to 40 people. After all, Ukraine is working not only to shoot down and destroy missiles, but also to identify persons who can program these missiles. Therefore, I won't be surprised if not only hardware but also so-called software runs out in Russia,""Grozev said.

&gt;The enemy also lost 873 main battle tanks, 2,238 armored combat vehicles, 408 artillery systems, 147 MLR systems, 69 air defense systems, 179 aircraft, 154 helicopters, 1,557 motor vehicles, eight ships/cutters, 76 fuel tankers, 191 operational and tactical-level UAVs, 28 units of special equipment, and four tactical missile launchers.


this article claims they've used 70% of their original amount, quoting the lead investigator of Bellingcat which I guess is considered credible

I read another claim that their factories have had to resort to surviving off only being able to manufacture double digits missiles per year so replacement rate isnt going to be that significant

as for when they run out who can say, Russia might reassess how they're going to want to use their small remaining amount. I recall hearing a month or more ago that it was the first day Kyiv had been able to completely stop all cruise missiles from hitting it. Since then some have gotten through.

All I know is it is very likely the attack was a deliberate attack. Reason, it happened at two locations at the same time. 

I've been to a lot of these industrial targets. How hard is it to hit these places? Well, oil facilities are particularly vulnerable as they go up in flames even in the USA with a safety culture. That said, to do it, my thoughts are it would require an insider in order to do it covertly. That insider would be a security guard, an engineer, or one of the blue-collared workers there. They would know the system and the weak points and the security schedule. So they'll know how to get in covertly and secretly. 

As far as protecting those big industrial targets, they are very very hard to protect. It can be done (as shown in the middle east), but it requires 100s of well trained and disciplined security professionals along with effective security equipment. Because it is a 24/7 job. And any lapse in security can be used as a way to attack.

After seeing the military in action, I highly highly doubt that they have any well-trained security professionals there. The ones they do have are probably at extremely high-valued places (Putin's bunker). The ones at industrial places are probably mall rent-a-cop level. So I'd expect 1-5 security guards who are drunk half the time and nodding off in the middle of the night. And then the work force as well can sort of double up as security. Which, at night time, is a skeleton crew - probably 5-10 people. 

The way I'd do it, if I was a saboteur and I had an insider and 5-10 people at my disposal, is I'd slip in at the middle of the night with a ""maintenance crew"" with valid badges and such. Then I'd have them plant bombs with timers to go off in 1-2 hours after planted. I'd plant the bombs at weak points in the infrastructure that would cause the most damage. I might even prep the area by opening valves. If it is possible to do that covertly without raising suspicion. Then slip out of the area with local traffic. Ideally, I'd like my saboteurs to be from out of town. I'd also take my insider out of the area unless they are able to stand up to interrogation. 

Another note, sometimes it is possible to use insiders without them even knowing. There are many many ways to do this. Especially lonely maintenance workers (talk to them at the bar - typical human intelligence) and satellite images with people who know these types of industrial facilities. It's a little harder to do, but definitely not outside the capability of a good intelligence officer. Would Russia have the people to figure out what really happened? Well, that's a good question. Especially if they get a fire every day for the next month. Their counterintelligence forces are probably already at the breaking point. 

We're lacking in details, so we have absolutely no idea how this occurred. Did they kill the security guards? Was it an inside job? Was in a drone from far away? Who was behind it if it was sabotage?

[],False,,Apprehensive_Sir_243,,,[],,,,text,t2_e99g1w2o,False,False,"&gt; NATO has no mandate to respond to other countries using nukes in third countries. Why would it declare war on Russia because of that?

If Russia starts using nukes in Ukraine, what sort of message do you think that sends to the world? Every single state will want to arm themselves with nukes to deter nuclear first-strikes. NATO wants to avoid nuclear proliferation because the more states that have access to nuclear arms, the more likely an irrational actor gets access to them and triggers a nuclear war.

&gt;It's like Bismarck's famous dictum of committing suicide in fear of death - to prevent a nuclear war NATO would engage in a war almost certain to become nuclear.

Yes, I agree it's counter-intuitive.

&gt;It's Russia's stated doctrine that it would go nuclear if a decisive defeat of its army is likely. A NATO conventional attack meets that condition and then some.

If Russia uses nukes in Ukraine, then NATO has to accept one of two realities:

1. Either there is no response from NATO. This signals to the world that using nuclear weapons (e.g. China on Taiwan) is acceptable and will be met with no pushback. This also signals to smaller countries that they will need to develop their own nuclear arms at almost any cost for deterrence. In the short-term, any risk of nuclear war is avoided but in the long-term, the risk of nuclear goes up.

2. NATO responds either with a tit-for-response or conventionally. In the short-term, there is a risk of nuclear war but assuming Russia doesn't start a nuclear war (more so than just using tactical nukes in Ukraine), the risk of nuclear war in the long-term goes down.

NATO will have to decide to either call Russia's bluff to avoid long-term nuclear proliferation or do nothing and expect more nukes in the future.",2404980d795eacdd71d3623bdbb2a26bc02f49e3,True,False,,,,,0,1650908769,,0,{},i65om6m,False,t3_ub4lh6,False,True,t1_i65m9p2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ub4lh6/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/i65om6m/,1650908784,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650879969.0

Yes but it wouldn't be over Ukraine but rather over Russia's usage of nuclear weapons and NATO's interests in nonproliferation and avoiding nuclear war in the long-term.

&gt;The way Russia would respond to the sinking of its fleet is not difficult to imagine.

Ultimately, NATO can decide how far they want to respond conventionally to nukes and that might exclude the sinking of its fleet.

But let us entertain the idea that NATO decides to sink their fleet. What is Russia going to do? They're already using nukes. I talked about the fear of a nuclear war in another comment:

Quotes from the Article: 

&gt; * The VDV - Russia’s airborne force - spearheaded the the invasion. In December, specialist units of the VDV had war-gamed their role in the repression of Ukrainian civil society…alongside…the…(FSB). The VDV assault units received the plan three days before the invasion and started excitedly talking in anticipation of their daring operation. VDV commanders started discussing their primary objective at Hostomel in clear. When the landed, therefore, they were met with Ukrainian artillery and a coordinated counterattack, quickly being driven from the airport. 

&gt; * The Russian motor rifle and Rosgvardia troops had received their orders less than 24 hours before the invasion. As a consequence they did not fight a methodical campaign of breakthrough and exploitation by successive echelons as their doctrine dictated, nor where they supported by sufficient artillery as is considered essential. 

&gt; * With little opportunity to prepare , psychologically or practically, many Russian units broke when they met serious resistance. 

&gt; * As a senior adviser to… commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, noted, ‘anti-tank missiles slowed the Russians down, but what killed them was our artillery. That was what broke their units’.

&gt; * Attacks throughout the depth of the advance also made the Russians unwilling to push sensitive EW and air-defense systems into Ukraine in case they were captured. So long as these systems were across the Ukrainian border, they could not jam the EMS on bearings to suppress the Ukrainians without also severing access to Russian forward elements. This was highly problematic at a time when Russian commanders were trying to unscramble the confusion that was engulfing their forward units. This had two consequences; the electronic suppression of Ukrainian radar and communications lifted after the first week, and senior Russian officers began to be drawn forwards, where like everything else in the Russian Army they became targets for snipers and artillery strikes. 

&gt; * Shelling inflicted heavy casualties on Ukrainian units while the volume of 30-mm cannon fire proved devastating in the close fight. …’the Russian equipment works as effectively as we feared, but it was incompletely employed’. 


&gt; * When it comes to prestige weapons like the Iskander-M short -range ballistic missile, there is a limit to the proportion of the stockpile Russia can expend against Ukraine without undermining its defense plans against NATO, China, and others. Without an assured supply chain to manufacture more, the Russians are having to retain a large proportion of the stockpile, which would restrict their ability to strike Ukraine in the coming months. But here the Russian military industry faces a problem, for Russia’s latest weapons are heavily dependent upon critical specialist components manufactured abroad. 

&gt; * The authors physically inspected one of these computers recovered from a crashed 9M727 during field work in April. The computer must be remarkably robust… Of the seven socket attachment points allowing data to be moved through the heat shield, one is of Soviet-era design and manufactured in Russia. The remaining six are all products of US companies. …The circuit boards themselves are sourced from the US.

&gt; * The pattern is universal. Almost all of Russia’s modern military hardware is dependent upon complex electronics imported from the US, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Israel, China and further afield. 

&gt; * While the 9th Directorate… prepared for the occupation of Ukraine from July 2021, the 11th Unit…responsible for Moldova, was assessing plans for the next round of operations… In November 2020, the FSB’s strategic objective in Moldova was to bring about ‘The full restoration of the strategic partnership between Moldova and the Russian Federation. 

&gt; * Tragically - as in Ukraine - the perception of declining influence appears to be pushing the Russians to take greater risks.",f9714d84eadd406c8cefe2cf085daf07e76795cc,True,False,,,,,0,1650906739,,0,{},i65ja0x,True,t3_ubpxth,False,True,t3_ubpxth,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubpxth/operation_z_the_death_throes_of_an_imperial/i65ja0x/,1650906752,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650877939.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;The UK assess that ""approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed"" fighting in Ukraine so far, Defence Secretary @BWallaceMP tells MPs

To put that KIA number in perspective for tallying the wounded in action: http://www.dupuyinstitute.org/blog/2016/10/27/wounded-to-killed-ratios/

At a guess, the Russians aren't backwards enough they can't keep KIA down to a 3:1 ratio of WIA to KIA, which comes to 45,000 WIA. 

Let's say half of them can return to duty. That's a rough guideline based on Vietnam War [as seen here](https://learning-media.allogy.com/api/v1/pdf/59ca4340-e2f2-4a1d-92d9-ee0398092628/contents). So that would mean 27,000 WIA are out of the war for good, on top of the 15,000 KIA, 42,000 total. If we look at the high number of Russian troops deployed to Ukraine , 200,000, that represents 21% of the total ARE GONE. 

However, total numbers are deceiving since not every Russian troop in Ukraine is combat arms, who are the ones who took most of the casualties. Whatever their true tooth to tail ratio it's very unlikely to be lower than 1:1 grunt for support troop, probably 1:2 but for conservative sake let's say half are combat arms and not a third or less (it's about 10% combat troops in the US military). So of 200,000 total troops then the max number of combat troops is 100,000. And since casualties will have dramatically affected those, say 75% of the 42,000 lost, that means as many as 31,500 combat troops out of 100,000, or 31.5% ARE GONE

Not to mention psychological casualties.*

Not to mention MIA presumed dead. 

Not to mention captured, which are thousands. 

Not to mention non-combat losses from sickness, accidents, desertions, which could equal or exceed combat casualties.



*Almost nobody is talking about PTSD but historically in this sort of war a significant part of the combat troops (and even some rear area troops under regular attack) will become psych casualties requiring temporary or permanent removal from their duties. Whatever the number is now, and it'll be high, it'll only grow higher as personnel remain in combat without a break. The threat will have been made much worse since the ferocity of this war was unexpected to the average Russian soldier who likely wasn't even told they were invading until the day of, and then told it would be a cake walk; they did not possess the hardened mindset necessary to mentally accept they were going into a meat grinder so it would be that much more shocking. The Russian brass can either accept the condition is real and try to treat it properly, or ignore it and treat it as a discipline/morale problem; either way they're going to have to deal with it and it's going to affect the entire current force.",6afb369c926780ffb5f26894ea7cd0b517834373,True,False,,,,,0,1650903752,,0,{},i65beqt,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,True,t1_i653uv9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i65beqt/,1650903766,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650874952.0

The UK assess that ""approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed"" fighting in Ukraine so far, Defence Secretary @BWallaceMP tells MPs


Russia has  lost lots of equipment, destroyed or captured. @BWallaceMP says a number of sources suggest this includes: - Over 2,000 armoured vehicles, including at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers &amp; 560 infantry fighting vehicles - 60 helicopters and fighter jets

The UK Defence Secretary says Russia committed over 120 Battalion Tactical Groups to its war in Ukraine - about 65% of its entire ground combat strength. Two months later, the UK assesses more than 25% of that force has been ""rendered not combat effective"".

""Ukraine - Mr Speaker - is an inspiration to us all,"" @BWallaceMP says. ""Their brave people have never stopped fighting for their lands. They have endured indiscriminate bombardments, war crimes and overwhelming military aggression.""

The Defence Secretary continues:  ""But they [Ukraine's people] have stood firm, galvanised the international community and beaten back the Army of Russia in the north and the north east."" 
He then talks about next phase of war in the east &amp; the need to keep giving Ukraine weapons


Weapons UK has given to Ukraine to fight Russia so far:
- More than 5,000 anti-tank missiles
- 5 air defence systems with 100+ missiles
- 1,360 anti-structural munitions
- 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives
- Starstreak high/low velocity anti-air missiles (in Ukraine for 3+ weeks)

Also, the UK PM @BorisJohnson has announced a further £100mln worth of ""high grade military equipment"", 120 armoured vehicles, sourcing anti-ship missiles &amp; ""high-tech loitering munitions for precision strikes"", UK Defence Secretary @BWallaceMP says

NEW: UK will give Ukraine a ""small number"" of Stormer vehicles fitted with launchers for anti-air missiles, the Defence Secretary tells MPs in a statement on Ukraine

The UK Defence Secretary calls the next three weeks of Russia's war in Ukraine ""critical"" and says the Ukrainian military needs more long range artillery and ammunition as well as anti-ship missiles. @BWallaceMP says that the UK is going to seek to help if possible.",52921a998edca3c698eafbaa10110f5c75f3ab02,True,False,,,,,0,1650900835,,0,{},i653uv9,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,True,t3_ubjh5n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i653uv9/,1650900849,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650872035.0

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"Is a JDAM really that hard to make? 

When they first came out they seemed an extremely efficient and useful device to modify a dumb bomb into a smart bomb. Which greatly increased the effectiveness of that bomb, protected the civilians and friendlies on the ground, as well as allowing the pilots having to deliver the ordnance to fly higher and safer. The expense and presumed simplicity of the device lead me to believe that they would proliferate widely and that in a few years most peer or near peer adversaries would be fielding them widely. 

But in Ukraine I have not seen the Russians with an equivalent device that they can strap to a conventional dumb bomb. In fact many of the recorded shoot downs of Russian aircraft are happening at low altitude while they drop dumb/conventional munitions.

In the twenty years of the US dropping JDAMs why has this tech not proliferated? It has been famous for a long time and the US use of precision guided munitions (PGMs) has been world famous. With many other militaries changing their tactics and structure of their military forces in response. 

&gt; JDAM bombs are inexpensive compared to alternatives such as cruise missiles. The original cost estimate was $40,000 each for the tail kits; however, after competitive bidding, contracts were signed with McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) for delivery at $18,000 each. Unit costs, in current-year dollars, have since increased to $21,000 in 2004 and $27,000 by 2011.[10] To the cost of the tail kit should be added the costs of the Mk80-series iron bomb, the fuze and proximity sensor which bring the overall weapon cost to about $30,000. For comparison, the newest Tomahawk cruise missile, dubbed the Tactical Tomahawk, costs nearly $730,000.[11][12]

Taking Kyiv and anything West of the Dnieper is completely out of the question after the humiliating withdrawal from Kyiv (no matter how much Russian propaganda and tankies try to copium it). 

Even taking everything East of the Dnieper seems like a stretch. That line just Southeast of Zaporizhzhia running West to East to the Donbas has been stagnant for weeks. And yes the Russians are now ramping up their offensive elsewhere but the Ukrainians have almost certainly reinforced that line to the teeth. 

Russia could overrun the Donbas, get that sham referendum in Kherson going and mint another puppet ""republic"", but at what cost? 

Russia very well may have lost **[two-thirds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1516329324567216129?t=6cf59Bp2NVSIDz6s8JzhvA&amp;s=19)** of their deployed tanks in Ukraine *even before the Donbas phase has begun* (several sources have said that Russia amassed 120 BTGs along Ukraine's borders with Belarus and Russia, and each one typically has 10 tanks, thus the 1200 figure you sometimes see pop up). [Extrapolating their rate of tank loses](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-42/) sets them up to lose their last active tank by the *summer*. 

Russia may very well reach the summit of the Mount Everest of its irredentist dreams, only for them to keel over dead 5 seconds later.

Ukraine isn't just going to sit down and let a low simmering war set in because Russia has nothing left to throw at them. If Russia runs out of tanks, APCs, etc. to throw at Ukraine, Ukraine can and will use that opportunity to push the Russians' advance from this current offensive back, and some more further back, then out of the Donbas and to the borders of the Russian Federation.

And yes, as many critics of something like /u/ Taw's model have pointed out, war isn't linear, but even *immediately* crashing the intensity of the war to 5 tanks/day (which is extremely unlikely, considering, you know, recent events...) only lasts Russia until August. Even cranking it down to 2 tanks lost per day (an insanely low proposition, even for a ""low simmering"" conflict), they can't even make it to the 1 year anniversary of the invasion. 

--- 

Russia has ~10,000 MBTs in ""reserve"" (this figure is probably actually about [6,000](https://youtu.be/eHhgVrKJJoA)) but we all know the vast majority of those are Soviet-era husks rusting away in some long forgotten warehouse in Siberia. And even for whatever tanks are useable, Russia would need to spend time and effort to transport those tanks to the frontlines and reconstitute a new substantive force (consider how many months it took to amass the February 24 invasion force). 

This goes the same for any mass conscription Putin could possibly introduce. Plus any conscript will need to be trained for months, lest they be incompetent buffoons (even moreso than the current Russian forces we've seen) sent into a meat grinder.

And what good is that if you have no tanks (Russia's sole tank manufacturer ceased operations thanks to biting sanctions) or IFVs/APCs to ride into battle? They're going to be about as effective as an African militia charging into battle on a bunch of technicals.

Putin's fired his super soaker on full blast for as long as he could; anything else, even if it is a lot, will be coming in at a trickle. If Putin's so stubborn he refuses to see the writing on the wall and admit defeat, we're going to get to the point where some Volodymyr manning a border post North of Kharkiv is just going to have a daily chore of firing a Javelin or NLAW at the daily 1 tank Russia scrounged up to ""assault"" Kharkiv.",04869f384b727ed89abc42f790acade1e84f86df,True,False,,,,,0,1650898316,,0,{},i64xkue,False,t3_ua3vr7,False,True,t1_i5vyf56,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua3vr7/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_23_2022/i64xkue/,1650898337,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650869516.0

Quotes from the Article: 

&gt; * Russians dislike the idea of full-scale nuclear war as much as we do, but using tactical nuclear strikes or threatening nuclear war is seen as legitimate if it fulfills national objectives that would otherwise not be accomplished. 

&gt; * While the US military has a worldwide presence and can project combat power throughout the globe, the Russian military operates within the country’s borders and is not well structured for expeditionary activities. 

&gt; * …while the Russians would enjoy operating near their borders and in countries of the former Soviet Union that have robust rail and pipe systems that the Russian military could readily use. 

&gt; * In short, a “winnable” conflict for Russia with the United States/Nato likely involves an exceptionally violent but relatively short conflict (I.e., days, weeks, months). A long conflict is not in Russia’s favor. 

&gt; * In the Russian view, the best military decision-making system should not involve an in-depth staff planning process, but should be a system where the commander has situational understanding and rapidly issues orders to perform standard tactics and /or battle drills adjusted for the enemy, terrain, etc., to influence the outcome of the battle. 

&gt; * In practice the Russian system of decision making requires a somewhat rigid system of tactics. 

&gt; * In short, a Russian commander prefers to execute a previously rehearsed mission that fulfills the mission requirements adequately, than attempting to pan and execute a custom designed mission that fulfills the mission perfectly. 

&gt; * Perhaps the biggest difference… is the perception of these (Spetznatz) forces as elites. 

&gt; * This broad usage of the term means that “spetznatz” cannot be thought of as equating to the Western concept of special forces operation forces. (SOF). 

&gt; * Currently the Russian VDV is manned with approximately 80 percent contract personnel; a far higher percentage than the GRU Spetznatz.",35071340ef8ded9a8ec135f57072ec280ec69edf,True,False,,,,,0,1650897907,,0,{},i64wkhp,True,t3_ubmncn,False,True,t3_ubmncn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubmncn/recommendations_for_intelligence_staffs/i64wkhp/,1650897925,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650869107.0

Taking Kyiv and anything West of the Dnieper is completely out of the question after the humiliating withdrawal from Kyiv (no matter how much Russian propaganda and tankies try to copium it). 

Even taking everything East of the Dnieper seems like a stretch. That line just Southeast of Zaporizhzhia running West to East to the Donbas has been stagnant for weeks. And yes the Russians are now ramping up their offensive elsewhere but the Ukrainians have almost certainly reinforced that line to the teeth. 

Russia could overrun the Donbas, get that sham referendum in Kherson going and mint another puppet ""republic"", but at what cost? 

Russia very well may have lost **[two-thirds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1516329324567216129?t=6cf59Bp2NVSIDz6s8JzhvA&amp;s=19)** of their deployed tanks in Ukraine *even before the Donbas phase has begun* (several sources have said Russia amassed 120 BTGs along Ukraine's borders with Belarus and Russia, and each one typically has 10 tanks, thus the 1200 figure you sometimes see pop up). [Extrapolating their rate of tank loses](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-42/) sets them up to lose their last active tank by *summer*. 

It would be a Pyrrhic victory. Russia may very well reach the summit of the Mount Everest of its irredentist dream, only for them to die on this hill 5 seconds later. 

Ukraine isn't just going to sit down and let a low simmering war set in because Russia has nothing left to throw at them. If Russia runs out of tanks, APCs, etc. to throw at Ukraine, Ukraine can and will use that opportunity to push the Russians' advance from this current offensive back, and some more further back, then out of the Donbas and to the borders of the Russian Federation.

And yes, as many critics of something like /u/ Taw's model have pointed out, war isn't linear, but even *immediately* crashing the intensity of the war to 5 tanks/day (which is extremely unlikely, considering, you know, recent events...) only lasts Russia until August. Even cranking it down to 2 tanks lost per day (an insanely low proposition, even for a ""low simmering"" conflict), they can't even make it to the 1 year anniversary of the invasion. 

--- 

Russia has ~10,000 MBTs in ""reserve"" (this figure is probably actually about [6,000](https://youtu.be/eHhgVrKJJoA)) but we all know the vast majority of those are Soviet-era husks rusting away in some long forgotten warehouse in Siberia.

Traditionally, it's extremely difficult to rotate troops off the front lines in the middle of an offensive unless one has a much larger number of available troops as those committed to battle, which Ukraine doesn't have. The French at Verdun is an example of it happening but that was a very localized battle and unique circumstances. It's actually a fault of a unit strength system that relies on being rotation for reconstitution because relieving units is very tough in the best of times and doesn't happen during the worst because there are never enough units (you need at least 1:1 in reserve, if 2:1 reserve to line to make it work). No decent commander stuck in an emergency is going to give up a combat effective unit that they can still get use out of just to give them a break, even if keeping them on the line destroys them for later use (Russians made the same decision to commit the units who had been in Kyiv and Sumy to the Donbas without a real break).

As the season gets warmer this situation will actually get worse, as the mud season prohibits excessive cross country movements so right now the limited number of defenders are able to mass at obvious roads and trails. Later on when the mud dries fully, Eastern Ukraine turns into some of the best tank country in the world, and the Ukrainians will need to commit even more troops to stop future Russian offensives (if they can even launch them by that point), they'll have to spread their lines out to cover much more frontage while keeping depth if they do want to be effective.

This has not been possible since the active war began on the 24th of February. Replacement units have been busy elsewhere and rotating an entire unit in the active fighting phase is just really challenging both tactically as well as logistically.

You would of course have reserves of different level. A company would hopefully have a platoon in reserve, which would be rotated out. Brigade would have a battalion worth of reserves further in the back and that would be rotated as well.

It is difficult to say what the original source had in mind in particular. Has his unit (platoon?) not had a chance to leave the actual trenches on the front, or did he mean they have not been taken to a deeper reserve or that they (the brigade) have not been rotated out entirely.

Desperate was the wrong word to use. However as the OP states the Australian Army is really only administratively and nominally a part of the ADF and is in fact an expeditionary force. The Army doesn't currently have the ability to drive a large hostile force off of the Australian mainland, because the defence policy assumes that the RAN and RAAF can make invasion impossible. While the Chinese probably have as much ambition to conquer parts of the Australian mainland as Japan did, the remotest possibility of an invasion occurring would be seen as unacceptable by the Australian public. There would almost certainly be panic among the population of the population if the ADF was seen to be stretched beyond its capacity.

&gt;Incidentally, I think there's a funny inverse relationship between the actual risk of military invasion, and how much people talk about it.

Define desperate. During WW2, the Japanese basically dismissed ideas of an invasion of Australia outright: it's too big, the supply lines are too long. I imagine China would have the same perspective. Therefore, the worst that Australia would likely face would be being cut off from its allies. 

(Incidentally, I think there's a funny inverse relationship between the actual risk of military invasion, and how much people talk about it.

Obviously, in a war, the Chinese would want to isolate Australia. So having the capacity to do so increases their security. 

I'm not really saying Chinese actions are 'justified', in the sense of being 'morally right', but I think that's a plainly stupid way of evaluating the actions of states. States generally try to improve their security situation. The last time Chinese forces fought US forces was in the 50's. That's within living memory. It's unsurprising that they would consider the US a threat, and also unsurprising that they would see Australia as a part of that threat.

I guess the point is, you might think of the idea of the west as 'bogeyman' is absurd, but for large parts of the world, especially east asia, it's just obvious. In the west, the Korean war is the 'forgotten war', while in Korea, it was the most bloody war in their history. In the west, the fact it was the Australian prime minister who (in extremely racist terms) blocked the inclusion of an anti-racism clause into the charter of the league of nations is a minor footnote. In Japan, it was one of many turning points in their modern history. 

Good diplomacy works through understanding the perspective of the counterparty. Western commentators, through a mix of deep ignorance, arrogance, and self-righteousness, tend to foreclose the possibility of diplomacy by simply lacking the tools to understand how the west is perceived by those parts of the world that are the historical targets of western aggression. I'm not saying it's 'right' (either in the moral or the strategic sense) for China to try and maneuver against western interests in the pacific, I'm just saying it makes a lot of sense. If western foreign policy elites ('the blob') were a bit more clear on that, I expect it would be to everybody's advantage.",827c86fff5768b383881502af06dd8b2db3109e5,True,False,,,,,0,1650867192,,0,{},i63kiqd,False,t3_u8cu2e,False,True,t1_i628dr2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8cu2e/solomon_islandschina_deal_australias_leaders/i63kiqd/,1650867206,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650838392.0

18k Japanese died at Iwo Jima, but also there **were** only 20k Japanese at Iwo Jima.  So the figure of dead at Iwo Jima isn't just ""18k"" but it's also ""basically all of them lmao"".  If 40k Japanese were stationed there the battle would have seen 36k+ dead Japanese.

This is 190k Russians, spread out across several thousand kilometers of open and hostile frontline, and with variable amounts of cover, and almost always on the offense, whereas the Japanese were dug in on the defense.  Plus, Iwo Jima was 5 weeks long and we're on week 8 or 9, and while ww2 era munitions were already pretty ghastly, post-information era gear definitely takes it up a notch.

&gt;I mean, Ukraine doesn't even have CAS, and is starving for artillery which is why the west is sending some now.

Well see here I think there's a misconception a lot of people have, that Ukraine was entering this war with sticks and stones.  Ukraine was armed to the teeth by European standards.  Unfortunately, Ukraine happens to be up against Russia (which despite all of its flaws was sitting on a mountain of gear), so there's an artillery gap, especially 2 months into the war when Ukrainian ammo is apparently getting low.  But like, Ukraine started the war with plenty of heavy gear and artillery, they didn't hold as fiercely as they did thus with their cocks and a Cuisinart.

&gt;Even if we assume every IFV and AFV and APC destroyed

Ok, but... this is also a weird argument to bring up.

Just off Oryx's confirmed count, we're looking at:

319 destroyed tanks/self propelled arty

621 destroyed AFV, IFV, APC, MRAP, IMV

527 destroyed trucks/jeeps/unknown vehicles

Sure, we don't have to assume they were chock full with people every time or that there was 100% loss of life, but considering:

These are only the confirmed losses and are probably significantly lower than the actual ones

Some of the captured/damaged vehicles also involved fatalities

Only a fraction of the casualties in a war are attached to a vehicle

These numbers can absolutely a picture of 10-15k dead.  In fact, a lot of people base their estimates partially off those numbers.  Seems pretty defensible to me.

21k deaths seems a bit inflated for me, but also certainly not ""delusional"" or anything.",ca4cf88d7627326a6150c1428cc57b163372b84e,True,False,,,,,0,1650855609,,0,{},i6311de,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i629txv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i6311de/,1650855624,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650826809.0

[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,True,"1.  I agree that if their plan is to conquer Ukraine and there is no alternative, then they will need to mobilize their entire society. I also agree that the sooner they do so, the better it will be for them. I'm with you there.  As I said in my post though, it might be so late that it doesn't matter. What good is being able to mobilize and sustain a moderately well-equipped army of 500K men two years from now? The major battles in Ukraine will be over by then. That's how long a mobilization on the scale you're talking about might take. Maybe longer.   A society-wide mobilization would inevitably include building the necessary facilities and items and requires a lot of planning.  Maybe it could be done.  This isn't 1945 though. Militaries are more complex, and they likely can't build all the items they need in the near future.  This is a global economy.   As I mentioned, Russia can't just equip a bunch of guys with AKs , they need tanks, artillery, shells, IFVS, etc.. and the items they build need to stand up to a NATO equipped Ukrainian army.  There are reports that Russia is trying to figure out how to conduct import substitution on some key components to their military-industrial complex, so maybe they are already working on this. The Russian economy is under sanctions though and they are missing some key components and feeder equipment. By the time they figure out what they need, what they need to do to build it, and how long it will take, that might be a year from now before they even get started equipping the first sets of people.  It might take another year to acquire/build enough import substituted parts to build the logistics capacity to support an army large enough to overcome Ukraine. I'm not just talking about tanks and missiles, I'm talking about being unable to build the basic shit like military trucks, kevlar vests, etc.. Russia might not be able to do that to a satisfactory capacity while Ukraine is being supplied by the west with better equipment.  Keep in mind, Russia is going to be engaged in combat the whole time this is happening. 

2. I completely agree. 

3. They might not be able to move to a type of war economy. World economies are very integrated these days, even military production.  Example: Russian engines for their Armoured trucks are built in China for a German company.  Do they have an engine manufacturer to replace these engines? If not, can the make an engine manufacturer? How long will it take to get the factory running? How many engines can they produce?   How much money per engine?  Do they have the feeder materials within Russia to build it?  Will the engines be as good? Will they need to alter designs of the truck.  That's just one component, there are HUNDREDS on a vehicle and there are hundreds of different military items that will need to be produced and each one might need a new factory.  Now, obviously some stuff can still be imported from friendly counties, but you still need to find suppliers away from the west, alter designs, etc.. this takes time and money.  Yes, some items like, say, socks can be produced locally, and Russia is a big country, but there are a lot fo complex items that Russia is going to need and they have spent the last 8 years failing to figure out how to build this stuff without the west.

4.  Their leadership has given them orders to continue, regardless of how wise those orders are. We can make fun of them later if they turn out to be bad ideas, but they aren't our decisions to make.

5.  Again, you need support from the people to continue this war, if the economy takes a dump and people are starving, conscription (especially unnecessary conscription) will just add to the problem.  You NEED to keep everyone working anyway if you want to have any chance of equipping your army.

6. We might not see support for the war fall for quite a while.

7. We always assume rational actors operating in smart, reasonable, ways but people make emotional and poor decisions all the time. 

8.  I doubt Ukraine can train, mobilize, and equip that many people so quickly, especially given the need for more advanced role sin tanks and such. 300-350K is much more reasonable. That said, you're right, there's a good chance that, if Russia keeps losing equipment and men much faster than Ukraine they'll eventually get outnumbered and killed they'll likely lose the war.

Nevertheless, it is a valid analysis of the escalatory options. It also, very tellingly, **offers no options for the West if Russia chooses to escalate**.

This situation is a simple consequence of the fact that, from the very start, Russia enjoys the escalatory dominance of the conflict. It can, at any point, choose to escalate further. As the article tacitly but very clearly reveals - this does not hold true for the West. At a certain point, it becomes impossible for the West to counter-escalate.

Let us follow the escalatory spiral so far:

\- Russia invaded Ukraine.

\- Ukraine successfully resisted, derailing some major elements of the Russian invasion.

\- the West counterescalated by providing first light and then heavy weaponry.  


We are at a point where Russia can (not necessarily will) escalate again by choosing one (or both) of the following options.

1) *A military mobilisation*. This would triple or quadruple the invasion army within six months. Hooker offers no way for the West to tackle this. Certainly, we would not provide hundreds of thousands of soldiers necessary.

2) *A nuclearisation of the Ukrainian battlefield*. This would almost certainly lead to a quick collapse of the Ukrainian resistance. Hooker is right in pointing out that in this case Russia stands to lose very little except its already abysmal reputation in the eyes of the West.

It is interesting that even Hooker, by not offering any possible option for Western riposte, tacitly admits that there is none. If Russia decides to climb the escalatory ladder further there is nothing the West can realistically do. We are not going to reply to a nuclearisation of Ukraine with a nuclear attack on Russia. We are not going to send in our troops.

The only thing that remains is to hope that Moscow will not do it.

This is 100% true, but I can't imagine these logistical issues are suddenly going to get easier to solve a few months from now when the Russian army is short on men and facing a larger Ukrainian force. A general mobilization (at least in my mind) wouldn't involve simply shoving AK-74s in the hands of 500,000 conscripts and telling them to start marching west. It means the planning, supply, and creation of logistical support for a much larger army, and the complete mobilization of the Russian economy to support this. A difficult task to be sure, but the longer the delay the harder it will be to accomplish when the time *does* come for it. 
2. By most accounts Russia is suffering from a severe manpower shortage. Something like 1/5 to 1/3 of all Russian troops sent to Ukraine have become casualties. This is a horrendous loss rate that no level of voluntary requirement can sustain. Russian forces are weaker than they were at the start of the war, and Ukrainian forces are getting stronger. This does not bode well for the future.
3. We don't have a good view into the true state of Russian military production, but we know they haven't moved to a full war economy yet. That would be extremely obvious, you'd see civilian factories being retooled towards production of tank/trucks and the like. Every day of delay mean it will be even longer until that equipment arrives at the front.
4. I'll agree Russia's army ""sucks at war"", but if they're not in it to win it they should just go home now. The war might not be over in a few months, or Russia could be losing. In fact that seems the mostly likely outcome unless Russia starts radically changing course.
5. I'd argue it would be better to conscription start now, not let people get the full read of exactly how bad unemployment really is. But that can be argued. And either way the economy is screwed, better not to have lost the war too.
6. This is, I think, the most logical answer. Putin sold this as a ""special military operation"", there might not be as high support for a ""war"".  But there's going to be a heck of a lot less support for a ""special military operation"" that everyone agrees Russia lost.
7. If that's true (and Putin believes it) then it seems inconceivable why Putin isn't trying to look for a negotiated settlement.  
8. A win like that might be worse than a negotiated settlement, but it's a might bit better than taking 3 or 4-to-1 casualties, wrecking your economy and *losing*. Ukraine has already started general mobilization. By the end of summer it will have an army of over 400,000, possibly 600,000. Without a mass conscription that starts *now*, against this Russia will likely have a force of around 100,000. Maybe 200,000 if Putin throws in the April conscript group. Such a mismatch could quite conceivably see Russia pushed out of all of its newly gained territories, the whole Dombas, and possibly even Crimea.",f2f6021bd7af3e9b92380ed2b6bc7bd9c2d63248,True,False,,,,,0,1650852797,,0,{},i62v9p1,False,t3_uat8yp,False,False,t1_i625gij,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i62v9p1/,1650852810,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650823997.0

&gt;It's not a comparision I made because the two conflicts match perfectly. I made the comparison because Iwo Jima is an extreme outlier. It was a huge garrison of suicidal soldiers on a island where retreat was impossible, with no air support or reinforcements, extremely limited medical supplies, and almost no fresh water, in a bloody fight to the death over a 6 week period.

&gt;The intensity of this conflict isn't even close to Iwo Jima, the soldiers aren't suicidal, and there is plenty of room for maneuvering, and Russia has plenty of medical equipment and resources at the front line. But for some reason, people are bending over backwards to overestimate the number of Russian KIA. I mean, Ukraine doesn't even have CAS, and is starving for artillery which is why the west is sending some now. CAS and arty accounts for the majority of KIA in every conflict for the past 120 years.

&gt;Even if we assume every IFV and AFV and APC destroyed so far was filled to the max with russian soldiers, and every destroyed vehicle resulted in 100% loss of life, which are wild assumptions that are observably untrue, we still don't even get close to justifying the figures coming from the Ukrainian government media sources.",25be4300129d4c0d9b04d921a87aad6345083f34,True,False,,,,,0,1650848985,,0,{},i62myu1,False,t3_uat8yp,False,True,t1_i62mb6e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uat8yp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_24_2022/i62myu1/,1650848997,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650820185.0

Unfortunately yes, Russian leadership can't admit defeat.  It risks them losing everything.  They've been telling Russians they are winning.  Admit you've made them a laughing stock and they will kill or replace you.

So they will continue as their entire conuntry/economic crashes around them.  And crash it will.
