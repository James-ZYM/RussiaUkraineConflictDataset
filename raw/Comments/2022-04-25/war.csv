That's just one of the many lies thrown out by the Ruskies to justify their illegal war of aggression and in all fairness, after they sent in agitators to Georgia to create a pretext for invasion and we did nothing. 

After they did exactly the same thing in Crimea and again, we did nothing...

Maybe it's partially our fault for not standing up to Putin sooner because Christ alive.

The Senile old fool tried exactly the same play book sending those same agitators into the Donbass in 2014 after taking Crimea to stoke up those tensions to you guessed it... Justify a peace keeping mission to... De-Nazify.... Or was it occupy or just reduce Ukraine to dust, civilians and all?

I do not believe in this alleged freedom of speech, since in the same USA there is strict censorship on the provision of information.
The most striking example is what happened to Assange and Snowden. if you have revealed the truth but the truth is related to the United States, then you are a criminal. In the EU, the situation is the same, if necessary, I can provide a bunch of examples.
 The same goes for the agenda that prevails in the mainstream, if you go against it, you are stigmatized and a cancellation culture sets in. This can be clearly seen from the BLM protests and the current situation with Ukraine. And it works through media corporations and social networks. So freedom of speech is a relative concept.

It lists ***over 100 sources*** so far, the vast majority of them clearly detail the Azov Battalion's deep and longstanding ties with white supremacists. I challenge you to actually read some of these articles. In fact, I'll go through a few of them right now.

Here is a New York Times article from 2020 coauthored by former FBI agent Ali Soufan who dedicated much of his career to stopping neo-Nazi violence.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/opinion/politics/white-supremacist-terrorism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/opinion/politics/white-supremacist-terrorism.html)

&gt;Defenders of the Ukrainian **Azov Battalion, which the F.B.I. calls ‚Äúa paramilitary unit‚Äù notorious for its ‚Äúassociation with neo-Nazi ideology,‚Äù** accuse us of being part of a Kremlin campaign to ‚Äúdemonize‚Äù the group. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the past several months ‚Äî at congressional hearings, in a report by the Soufan Center, and in a letter to the State Department signed by 40 members of Congress ‚Äî we have **documented the existence of a global network of white supremacist extremists** that stretches across North America, Europe and Australia. White supremacists today are organizing in a similar fashion to jihadist terrorist organizations, like Al Qaeda, in the 1980s and 1990s. They transcend national barriers with recruitment and dissemination of propaganda. And **just as jihadists exploited conflicts in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Syria, so too are white supremacists using the conflict in Ukraine as a laboratory and training ground.**\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Mair, who is serving a life sentence, was himself closely connected with **National Action, a British group that has sought to funnel fighters to Ukraine.** \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**Almost twice as many foreign fighters have traveled to join the civil war in Ukraine than to Afghanistan in the ‚Äô80s** ‚Äî a conflict which birthed Al Qaeda.

This (VERY recent) 2021 article by TIME also includes **an 8 minute video** that I ***highly recommend*** you watch. [https://time.com/5926750/azov-far-right-movement-facebook/](https://time.com/5926750/azov-far-right-movement-facebook/)

&gt;When they finally rendezvoused, Fuller noticed the swastika tattoo on the middle finger of Furholm‚Äôs left hand. It didn‚Äôt surprise him; **the recruiter had made no secret of his neo-Nazi politics. Within the global network of far-right extremists, he served as a point of contact to the Azov movement, the Ukrainian militant group that has trained and inspired white supremacists from around the world**, and which Fuller had come to join. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**Outside Ukraine, Azov occupies a central role in a network of extremist groups stretching from California across Europe to New Zealand, according to law enforcement officials on three continents.** And it acts as a magnet for young men eager for combat experience. Ali Soufan, a security consultant and **former FBI agent who has studied Azov,** estimates that more than 17,000 foreign fighters have come to Ukraine over the past six years from 50 countries. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apart from offering a place for foreign radicals to study the tricks and tools of war, the Azov movement, through its online propaganda, has fueled a global ideology of hate that now inspires more terrorist attacks in the U.S. than Islamic extremism does** and is a growing threat throughout the Western world. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**Among Azov‚Äôs closest American allies has been the Rise Above Movement, or RAM, a far-right gang**, some of whose members have been charged by the FBI with a series of violent attacks in California. The group's leader, Robert Rundo, has said his idea for RAM came from Ukraine's far-right scene. ""This is always my whole inspiration for everything,"" he told a right-wing podcast in September 2017, referring to Azov as ""the future."" ""They really have the culture out there,"" he said. ""They have their own clubs. They have their own bars. They have their own dress style.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The main recruitment center for Azov, known as the Cossack House, stands in the center of Kyiv, a four-story brick building on loan from Ukraine‚Äôs Defense Ministry. In the courtyard is a cinema and a boxing club. The top floor hosts a lecture hall and **a library, full of books by authors who supported German fascism**, like Ezra Pound and Martin Heidegger, or whose works were co-opted by Nazi propaganda, like Friedrich Nietzsche and Ernst J√ºnger. On the ground floor is a shop called Militant Zone, which **sells clothes and key chains with stylized swastikas and other neo-Nazi merchandise.**  
&gt;  
&gt;""It could be described as a small state within a state,"" says **Olena Semenyaka, the head of international outreach for the Azov movement.** On a tour of the Cossack House in 2019, **she told TIME that Azov‚Äôs mission was to form a coalition of far-right groups across the Western world, with the ultimate aim of taking power throughout Europe.**  
&gt;  
&gt;It might seem ironic for this hub of white nationalists to be situated in Ukraine. At one point in 2019, it was the only nation in the world, apart from Israel, to have a Jewish President and a Jewish Prime Minister. Far-right politicians failed to win a single seat in parliament in the most recent elections. **But in the context of the white-supremacist movement globally, Azov has no rivals on two important fronts: its access to weapons and its recruiting power.** \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**From across Europe and the U.S., dozens of fighters came to join Azov that year, many of them bearing tattoos and rap sheets earned in the neo-Nazi underground back home.** The Ukrainian authorities welcomed many of them, and in some cases granted them citizenship. Within the war‚Äôs first year, Biletsky‚Äôs militia was officially absorbed into the National Guard, becoming a regiment within Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces.  
&gt;  
&gt;That status came with an arsenal that no other far-right militia in the world could claim, including crates of explosives and battle gear for up to 1,000 troops.",c1a3a495381465812bbe21a987c98325c6ead555,True,False,,,,,0,1650910062,,0,{},i65s0qu,False,t3_ubkcr1,False,False,t1_i64p7b5,/r/war/comments/ubkcr1/off_topic_russian_bots/i65s0qu/,1650910074,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1650881262.0
