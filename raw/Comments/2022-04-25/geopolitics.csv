[],False,,CoachKoranGodwin,,,,,,"India is the getting FDI it needs, including from the Us. Beyond that it’s getting a lot from Japan and Singapore as well. It’s going to continue getting Russian oil for cheap until the US offers arms worth abandoning Russia for. And FWIW, India is probably closer now than it has been in the past, considering how Russia has gotten closer to China. Even if it doesn’t seem that way, all the noise created around this most recent situation will most certainly have an impact even if from the outside it appears that things are slow moving.

India’s biggest obstacles are a lack of infrastructure and lack of manufacturing, you are correct. However, India doesn’t need an HDI of 0.9 to be powerful and it probably never will get there. If it gets to 0.75 the country will still be a very big deal and that is very much within striking range. I don’t think India will ever not be home to extreme levels of poverty. The question is if it can capture enough of its population with low value added labor and manufacturing to stimulate overall development. I honestly don’t think that is going to be as big an issue as you make it out to be given how centrally located India is in relation to global trade.

Other countries had trouble making the jump from manufacturing to services, but India’s development has been backwards and it’s services sector remains highly competitive while manufacturing is under developed. There’s still massive potential for manufacturing development to occur and lots of time as well.

The brain drain in India is created from a lack of infrastructure and a lack of a true international market for essentially the entire second half of the 20th century. Now what is occurring is that India sends a large amount of students overseas who either return with professional jobs or stay and provide remittances which boost the overall economy. Any other country would suffer if it were exporting this amount of people, but India has continued to produce talented people for this long because it’s higher education system is actually so competitive that companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon head directly to their campuses for recruitment. India’s biggest advantage is it’s sheer human capital, how consistently it has been able to produce it, and how well this human capital integrates into the global economic system. 

Russian IT professionals leaving after wartime sanctions is brain drain, Indian professionals and students leaving and sending remittances aren’t. Especially when there have been consistent replacements for them every step of the way. 

Finally, India doesn’t need to control the Indian Ocean. It just needs to protect its own region and it will inherently have an outsize naval presence on the world stage given its neighborhood, especially if it has good relations with the US and Japan. And seeing how the UK has given the Indian Navy blueprints for its own aircraft carriers I would assume that’s the case. No other country in the region has a naval presence worth even mentioning. Beyond that, it isn’t the size of its navy *now* that matters as much as what the potential and trend lines point towards. Even taking global shipping out of the equation, India’s maritime neighborhood is much less crowded and way more open than say, China or Russia’s. Beyond that it is on good relations with Japan and US to the point of conducing naval operations alongside them. France and the UK which are essentially the next most important global naval powers also have a great relationship with India. 

FWIW, I don’t think India truly needs or wants a navy that’s globally competitive with Japan or the US Navy. Historically only one Indian empire intervened in the Strait Malacca and aside from that it has been isolationist. And I think that’s the ultimate point really. India is probably the most isolationist great power outside of Japan and the US and due to its history of colonization it’s probably going to stick its finger in the eye of everyone who tries to steer it to do its bidding because it’s mostly content with just developing by itself. Remember back when the British ruled India there routinely were famines resulting in tens of millions of deaths. Since then, even while being almost completely cut off from global trade, India has managed to consistently feed all its people. It’s way more independent than people give it credit for, and ironically a lot of that has to do with how underdeveloped it still is.",8f7b05e6cda1082162b19680ed4b3edb563e393b,True,False,,,,,0,1650919415,,0,{},i66fvm2,False,t3_u8meu9,False,False,t1_i66ahtd,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8meu9/washingtons_clumsy_attempts_to_bully_india_must/i66fvm2/,1650919433,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650890615.0,[],text,t2_6v5kgwq,False,False

A significant chunk of Silicon Valley leaders were born and educated in India. The country is third in overall AI research and development and is a key US ally in that field. It’s services sector is highly competitive and it’s manufacturing sector is becoming increasingly so, especially with the rise in costs for Chinese labor. 

Beyond that, it’s geographical position lends it incredible latent naval power. India is basically the only country on Earth that doesn’t even need a blue water navy to unilaterally shut down global sea trade. 70% of all maritime trade goes through the Indian Ocean and Southern India is home to some of the richest and longest lasting civilizations in human history because of that position in maritime trade. All oil coming out of the Persian Gulf towards East Asia and all computer chips coming from East Asia towards Europe have to go through India and with the US becoming completely oil independent after shale we will no longer have as much motivation to protect other people’s oil transport. China, Japan, Korea etc, all have to wait for all of their oil to travel all the way around the Indian Ocean before they can receive it. In the past this worked because the US Navy protected everyone’s shipping to enforce global trade and protect its own economic partners. But if and when the US pulls out, all those countries will suffer while India is still in prime position. 

Another thing is that Indian brain drain is not a thing and never will be.

Look at the people Hitler ended up surrounding with at the end of his life, people who were willing to kill their six children and were arguably more fanatics than Hitler himself.
Of course the situation is not nearly the same, but you get the point I'm making, when governements devolve into full autocracy under a strong charismatic leader, reasonable people, many who even support the government to a certain capacity, are systematically replaced by people who are loyal to the regime and who are even more imbued in all the extreme nationalistic rethoric. This is usually harmful to these autocracies because they usually end up replacing capable people with inoperants who are just loyal (likely one of the causes Russia underperformed in this war).

The concept obviously depends on a lot of factors (e.g. in a dog eat dog scenario (much less likely scenario), raw materials will matter a lot, in a stable competition environment it won't matter as much since you can just trade), but to me high quality education is the biggest multiplier of capability in the long run.

Any country/company/whatever that develops a respectable advantage in certain future techs, can easily monopolize markets. An extreme case of this is that the first country that unlocks higher level AI for example could rush ahead of the curve by many orders of magnitude.

To me military strength matters, but only in the now. That is to say, military tech can go obsolete, so even if you have a powerful onfield military, if you don't have the capability to keep it up-to-date and competitive, it's not actually that powerful as Russia's been showing pretty clearly.

[],False,,OverpricedUser,,,,,,"1. Total BS about imminent attack. Everybody knew that DPR and LPR are Moscow puppets, everybody knew that Russia would love nothing more than to provoke ukrainian attack to give them reason for 'peacekeeping' mission. They did that in Georgia. Ukraine was building military because they knew Russia was preparing for invasion. They have been talking about this war for 8 years. Most people in the west, including me, thought they were a bit paranoid. If everything is genocide, nothing is - this applies to current situation also. Yes, there was ugly war with civilian casualties, but people died on both sides, not just Donbas being shelled constantly by ukrainians. DPR and LPR are also responsible for that war. Russia too.
2. Zelensky was vocal about nukes, because Russia violated Budapest memorandum in 2014, a treaty that Ukraine gave up nukes over security promises. If Ukraine had nukes, would Russia invade?
3. Is NATO a threat to Russia? Or is it Russia being paranoid? Or even if it's a convenient 'boogyman' for state propaganda? Yes, Russia has interests in Ukraine, west does also. Does west use violence to get what they want - sometimes, but is west preparing to attack Russia, overthrow Putin? Really? Russia has nukes, lots of them. I think they can feel pretty secure about themselves if you ask me.
4. Well, there have been plenty of elections since Euromaidan in Ukraine. There was election in 2019 and Zelensky won by a big margin. How can he be illegitimate if he's democraticaly elected. Calling maidan a 'nazi' coup only works in brainwashes russian minds.

There are no territorial disputes with Russia, last I've heard.

It's not about Russia's interests, it's about Russia's methods. If they wanted Ukraine not to join NATO they could have had friendly relationship with them and there would be no need for military alliances. Support for joining NATO grew after Crimea and Donbas. Russia wants Ukraine to be a servant, not a friend, they think it's their territory and can't have 'west' have it - it would be humiliation. So NATO is not a threat for Russia's security, but it's a threat for Russia's aspirations as a superpower and desire to rule the region.",94895b8c21fd7efc26c65e085216074501589374,True,False,,,,,0,1650890817,,0,{},i64goa6,False,t3_t020va,False,False,t1_i5qatb0,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i64goa6/,1650890832,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650862017.0,[],text,t2_2ir0ji8y,False,False

In the same year, political Islam came to power in Iran in a revolution whose influence reverberated beyond that country, thanks partly to the U.S. organization of Islamist resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Around the same time, amid the depths of stagflation and social anomie, the Reagan-Thatcher revolution launched a renewal of the Anglo-American sphere with an emphasis on free markets, which ignited decades of growth and would eventually force the political left back to the center, with the advent of Tony Blair’s New Labour in the United Kingdom and Bill Clinton’s New Democrats in the United States. This remarkable combination—a market-Leninist China, political Islam in power, and a revived West—reshaped the globe more profoundly than anything since the postwar transformations of Germany and Japan and the consolidation of the U.S.-led West.

Let's stop pretending that it's in same position as Germany.",f6d794564ce6ce67194f6933bc417cdc7c870c20,True,False,,,,,0,1650856590,,0,{},i632yn7,False,t3_u8meu9,False,True,t1_i5p8rpw,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8meu9/washingtons_clumsy_attempts_to_bully_india_must/i632yn7/,1650856606,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650827790.0,[],text,t2_2r60xo3y,False,False

A month or two huh?A lot of things you ardently believed a month or two ago aren't true now. Feel free to deny it but I'm talking to you directly and you know that's correct. And you should also consider that what you're saying in this comment you believe every bit as ardently.Bit of an moment for retrospection, innit?

  
A month ago I said the Russians were winning and would win and nothing's changed. Timelines will vary as objectives vary.

  
I noticed that you made this comment almost word for word to another redditor in another thread:

&gt;  
Think about how many predictions you've had to abandon or postpone in the last 2 months. You won't admit it to me, but you know there's been quite a few.You were as ardently sure of them as you are now sure of your current assessments.Bit of an ""oh f\*\*k"" moment, innit?
