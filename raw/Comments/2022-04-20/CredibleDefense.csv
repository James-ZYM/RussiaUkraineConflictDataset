For examples, look at the second battle of Fallujah. 

10,500 US forces (6500 marines, 1500 soldiers and an assorted 3500 navy support personnell)  + iraqi and coalition troops tasked with clearing out 4000 al queda fighters in a city of 275,000 (slightly larger than half the size of mariupol).   Granted 70% to 90% of the population fled in advance of the battle. The ""western"" border of the city is the Euphrates river, and ""downtown"" edges right up to the river with three main bridges spanning the river. 

Coalition forces established a tight cordon around the city with checkpoints on pretty much all major roads.  They used satellite and aerial footage to create grid maps of the city and began artillery and air strikes on identified insurgent targets.      

Marine Recon and Navy Seal snipers were deployed in high points on the outskirts of the city to identify targets and watch for movement of enemy forces. 

As a ""diversion""  on the evening of November 7th, 2004 various units attacked from the west and south. seized the Hospital, the ING Building, the main bridge across the Euphrates River, and some villages across the Euphrates river. 

On the morning of November 8th, two SeaBee Units and marine units occupied power substations and cut power to the northern half of the city.  Two marine regimental combat teams and two US army Battalions from the 7th Armored Cav and the 2nd Mechanized launched an attack from the north into the city center, methodically clearing buildings, block by block. 

Four more army infantry battalions followed them explicitly tasked with clearing and occupying any buildings not cleared in the first wave.  The goal was effectively to have a front line that was ""clear"" so US forces did not have to worry about any attacks from the rear. 

A marine reconnaissance battalion, an army light infantry battalion and 7 three man SEAL teams were tasked with infiltrating the city and interdicting any enemy units fleeing from or moving to the battle line. 

The UK's black watch battalion was assigned to patrol the eastern border of the city and interdict any forces fleeing to the east.   

All during the battle, the US had close air support on hand from a variety of aircraft, as well as 120mm mortars based on the west side of the river and 155mm artillery.   

the main clearing of the city took approximately 1 week of hard fighting, and 54 American soldiers were killed and 425 were wounded.   By the time the city was fully cleared, 95 had been killed and 105 were wounded.",dce49224b258a7218c002cd862ba537c0832b0c6,True,False,,,,,0,1650499134,,0,{},i5juupr,False,t3_u7uuo2,False,True,t1_i5jkzmh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7uuo2/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_20_2022/i5juupr/,1650499148,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650470334.0,

&gt;For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:

&gt;on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

"" when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on""

That will mean NATO troops getting whacked in Ukraine (which is in Europe) is still ground to invoke Article 5. The countries whose forces got whacked can invoke Article 5, BUT:

&gt;With the invocation of Article 5, Allies can provide any form of assistance they deem necessary to respond to a situation. This is an individual obligation on each Ally and each Ally is responsible for determining what it deems necessary in the particular circumstances.

&gt;This assistance is taken forward in concert with other Allies. It is not necessarily military and depends on the material resources of each country. It is therefore left to the judgment of each individual member country to determine how it will contribute. Each country will consult with the other members, bearing in mind that the ultimate aim is to “to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

Say Poland invoke Article 5 when its troops are killed in Ukraine and it invokes Article 5. Well, France can still say ""Yes, we will help you"", and ships 500 helmets because that may be what France determine to be necessary.

&gt; **STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT NATO ENLARGEMENT WAS A MISTAKE, CONFIDENCE LEVEL 10
&gt; Senior Vice President and Director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council**
&gt; 
&gt; NATO enlargement was a process through which like-minded states who shared the values of alliance members and met certain criteria made the sovereign decision to apply for formal membership. The applications of all new members since the end of the Cold War were accepted and ratified by the democratically elected parliaments of every NATO member state. Thus, this alliance is one of real, shared mutual interests and values. The sovereign decision on whether to join an alliance is codified in international law pursuant to every nation-state’s right to pursue reasonable measures for its own self-defense. For most of the enlargement process, the security environment in Europe was relatively benign compared with the Cold War, and, in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even Vladimir Putin commented that he didn’t see a problem with the enlargement of the alliance. Now, with Putin having invaded and occupied portions of sovereign neighboring countries no less than four times in the last 14 years, those countries that joined NATO since the end of the Cold War are very happy that they chose to do so.
&gt; Despite Putin’s rhetoric and propaganda about NATO and its enlargement, he doesn’t really feel threatened by the prospect of a NATO invasion of Russia, which is an absurd notion on its face. Putin is using NATO enlargement as a way to distract from his greatest fear—losing his own, personal grip on power (including his continued theft of billions of dollars from the state) through a democratic revolution by the Russian people. **If Ukraine had continued on its path to become a thriving, Western-oriented democracy, Putin feared that Russians would look at their neighbors next door, see the freedoms and prosperity that Ukrainians enjoyed, and seek the same for themselves.**

My concerns is whether domestic issues might force Xi Jinping to invade Taiwan. Historically, rulers had used wars to distract their people from domestic issues. As mentioned in 11 and 12, China faces many domestic issues such as Covid, lockdowns, the housing bubble collapse, etc. A war would distract the people from these issues and rally them around CCP and Xi Jinping again.

What’s more, this year there will be the 20th National Congress for the CCP. It’s expected that Xi Jinping will be elected to become leader of the party again (he removed term limits, but he still needs to be elected by the CCP elites to lead). However, with the above mentioned domestic issues, some within China may start to question if Xi Jinping is still the strong leader the country needs.

My fear is that if he *perceives* his position being threatened or seriously questioned as a result of these issues, he may decide to invade Taiwan to secure his position, or perhaps to create an emergency so he can’t be removed from power. I wonder though how likely this scenario is…",fd7da49658f9abf9a65e0a56b03495a7ef6dab04,True,False,,,,,0,1650492918,,0,{},i5jgo53,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5eze8m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5jgo53/,1650492931,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650464118.0,

2. As an extra to the above, there should be some videos, might not be of dead, but people fleeing. Don't tell me China can cut it all off or the likes, just look at videos from shanghai coming out of lock down, while Xinjiang is poorer, but smartphones aren't all that expensive either (cheap low quality can still surf Internet and take pictures).

4. How many? Millions like some have claimed? Do you know how many police/guards etc. Would be needed for that? Try looking how many people the US prison system employs.

[],False,,gaiusmariusj,,,[],,,,text,t2_orwh0,False,False,"&gt;I see national identity and the century of humiliation as inextricably tied to face. Is this a wrong way to see it?


Chinese people are human, just because culturally foreign doesn't mean there isn't some basic rules they don't follow. Face is just a bullshit term used by half assed western attempts to magic hand wave Chinese activity, *oh it's their face thing, you know* and then you don't have to explain things anymore as if face is a magic thing different from pride etc.

Without going to detail of what is face/mianzi and what is lizi (concrete things), I just have to point out that the Century of Humiliation has a bit to so with face, like when UK loses a match against Argentina, although I wager the average Chinese feel a lot less associated with the defeat of the Daqing than the avg Brits on losing a match to the Argentina. That is to say for the vast majority of Chinese they aren't going to feel personally connected to the debacle of the Qing.

Then national identity has nothing to do with face. 

&gt;My understanding of the legitimacy of the current Chinese government is that ""it's the economy, stupid"". So long as the Chinese government keeps living standards rising, I would expect CPC to retain power.

Sure, but what made the Chinese accept the economy in the first place? Or better yet, how did the Chinese government in the 70s in utter paranoia about an American invasion turn to the modern Chinese government, a government that is more interested in trade and tech than to defend against an American invasion? Because the Three Joint Communique. That is economy is the foundation only because the previous foundation of safety and security is in **understanding ** or so the Chinese thought. The Chinese government use to be way worse than Iran. They actively export regime changing revolutionary ideology and support for rebels. SEA is not a safe place in the 60s and 70s. There were intense fighting throughout SEA with backing from China to overturn *Western Imperialist*. This only changed with the Three Joint Communique. And the Three Joint Communique is rooted in the understanding of Taiwan. People can argue about semantics about the meaning of the wordings, but let's not kid what the Chinese meant about the danger and sensitivity of Taiwan. You don't have to agree with them, you do have to recognize how they view the world. I think most Americans are incapable of doing so, as most Americans are born in the era of utter American dominance and was always the victor and conqueror, they can't comprehend how states would view other states in a completely different lens. But the US attempt to hold any Chinese soil in any form would be view as an end to the Three Joint Communique, that the US and China have no territorial ambition about each other.

Economics is good, but the economics is based on a certain understanding of security. That the US isn't interested in taking over China or puppeting China. 

It doesn't mean China is going to just invade Taiwan out of the blue, but it certainly does not mean when push comes to shove, the economic side will win out against security.

&gt;National pride can be swallowed, but I have little confidence in predicting that it will be swallowed. China was weak for ages. They haven't been in a position to consider war for pride for many generations.

I like to point out that the reason China was defeated was because both China was weam **and** China fought. 

This is not to say China won't fight back when it's core interests are threatened. China fought the British, the French, the Russian, the Japanese, and the Americans. These were all great powers in the 19th and 20th century. China has the willingness to fight even if it loses, but it isn't going to fight for pride. I don't see why that starts now.

&gt;I would say that most countries in the world have some complaint that their de facto borders are unjust. I don't see grounds to say that China is being singled out on that point. The West is enforcing status quo borders, not trying to return all land to its just holder. I doubt such a thing is even theoretically possible; too many competing claims exist.

This isn't an answer to the Chinese position. 

If you want to resolve Taiwan peaceful you must convince the Chinese. 

In order to convince the Chinese to must answe two of their fundamental questions. 

First, do you think spoil of war in the end of 19th and 20th century is acceptable, as pointed out in the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Declaration?

Second, if it isn't, then why is it the Chinese territory of Taiwan, that was unjustly taken, with no other state claiming it, prevented from the only nation claiming it?

Without answering these 2 questions in its satisfaction you cannot obtain Chinese acquiesce. 

The west cannot enforce its rules unilaterally on China without defeating China, any rules the Chinese must agree to. Like WTO, China will accept its rulings because China agreed to its system.

China agreed to a world system on certain basis. The chief amongst them was national sovereignty and territorial integrity is sacrosanct, and that land taken from China by Japan in the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars will be returned. To say the west would enforce borders of status quo is nonsensical. Who is the west to enforce upon any sovereign states without rules? But if there are rules, why are you not following it?",8a810c5c5490aade3345446158a1a0432e7a1981,True,False,,,,,0,1650490758,,0,{},i5jbi70,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5j7ggz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5jbi70/,1650490771,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650461958.0,

My thinking (I may be wrong) is that one of the reasons the US didn’t directly intervene in the Hong Kong protests in 2019 was because it wanted to maintain a good working relationship with China. However, during war, that would be impossible. So with that reason gone, would US and its allies attempt to fight over Hong Kong too?

After all, geographically Hong Kong is relatively close to Taiwan, and it has ports which US can use. The people of Hong Kong also had terrible experiences with the Chinese government and had something close to a democracy. It would also divert some of the Chinese army from Taiwan too.

&gt;So are you talking about an entire different scenario?

That's entirely possible, I was mostly arguing that compared to Russia, China does far more trade with the US and so would stand to lose more in event of sanctions being imposed. 

As people are pointing out that's true in a vacuum, but combined with the events that would require sanctions to be imposed becomes more complex, since either there's a total war between the US and China, in which case the economy is no longer a priority, or there's a minor clash in which case I'd assume both sides would be keen to make amends in exchange for a return to normal relations.

&gt;Even if we are talking about a short conflict, what's stopping US and China from trading again?

I'd imagine nationalism would play a huge part, depending on the losses of each side, but I do think that trade would eventually resume, and it would be in the interests of both parties to do so.",3f70212706174b0ce8cceedf9a41d45901ab5360,True,False,,,,,0,1650490447,,0,{},i5jarha,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5izczy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5jarha/,1650490458,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650461647.0,

I see national identity and the century of humiliation as inextricably tied to face. Is this a wrong way to see it?

&gt;No modern Chinese government, be them democratic autocratic monarchic or theocratic could change that narrative, thus all of them would face a legitimacy crisis if they fail to defend the Chinese state and its territorial integrity.

My understanding of the legitimacy of the current Chinese government is that ""it's the economy, stupid"". So long as the Chinese government keeps living standards rising, I would expect CPC to retain power.

Of course, I see no reason for CPC to concede Taiwan. It would surely anger the Chinese people to no productive purpose.

&gt; As for the situation at the [front]. 
**Nikolaev-Kherson-Krivoy Rog** front - basically unchanged. Positional battles, artillery and air strikes from both sides.        
**Zaporozhye - Orekhov - Gulyai-Pole** - the same thing, although it is here that the ""pain point"" of the front of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is located in the event that the command of the RF Armed Forces decides to encircle the entire Donetsk group with a breakthrough in the communications linking this group with the Dnieper.
To the **east of Gulyai-Pole**, the Russian Armed Forces and the DPR Armed Forces have little tactical advance.                    
**Mariupol** - stubborn battles continue in the vicinity of Azovstal. When the destruction of the garrison of the ""fortress"" is completed, I definitely still can't judge (previously I gave a forecast ""perhaps by the end of the month""). It is already clear that the timing of the completion of the assault will depend mainly on how quickly the supplies of equipment, ammunition and food from the encircled will run out. In any case, the time and effort spent on the assault cannot be returned.                  
Along the front line from **Vuhledar (under enemy control) to Popasna** - no change. Positional battles and fierce artillery shelling, strikes by the Russian Air Force.
In **Popasnaya**, heavy street fighting continues with the gradual advance of the LPR Armed Forces and the PMCs involved (on which, including the Wagner, the main burden of the fighting now lies there).
**Along the Seversky Donets from Popasnaya to Izyum**, our troops occupy the territory gradually abandoned by the enemy (the Armed Forces of Ukraine competently and quite timely - that is, ahead of time - reduce the front and withdraw their troops from the ""bag"" in order to strengthen the threatened flanks of the group with them). The Armed Forces of the LPR occupied Kremennaya, advanced towards Krasny Liman (Liman) and Yampol. But both of these points still remain with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In Rubizhne and near Severodonetsk, the situation at the front is unchanged.                   
**South of Izyum**, the RF Armed Forces continue their attempts to move south - towards Slavyansk and Barvenkovo. Unfortunately, without much success.                   
**West of Kharkov**, for two days, the enemy undertook a series of counterattacks and managed to push the units of the Russian Guard to the west and south-west of the city, advancing several kilometers and occupying from 3 to 5 settlements. This advance does not yet pose any threat to the communications of the advancing (trying to advance) grouping in the Izyum region, it also has no operational significance, but is used by Ukrainian propaganda to demonstrate military successes. It is worth noting that - unlike the Ukrainian military - Russian troops avoid stubbornly defending the occupied settlements.                        
**North of Kharkov** - no change. Positional clashes, skirmishes.    

This would be somewhat consistent with (an obviously very limited) picture of Russian movements I am painting following other sources. When measuring by distance the only major progress Russian forces have made is towards Lyman where they had captured Kreminna yesterday. A host of [Walter Report](https://twitter.com/walter_report) (a daily open discussion of experts in the field) claims that UAF retreated from their positions there because of overwhelming numbers of Russian armored vehicles (a few dozens) storming the city. [There are also reports](https://twitter.com/AggregateOsint/status/1516486299825418247) of RAF &amp; co's movement east of Izium southwards. [When you look](https://liveuamap.com/) at the area between Izium and Kreminna, there's a pocket Ukrainian forces are probably retreating from since there are no significant objectives there, mostly open fields. It doesn't make much sense to fiercely defend it. This would probably explain relatively rapid Russian advancements in the area.      

There doesn't seem to be any important successes of RAF on the other axes, not sure about situation in the cities, but we can expect probably a slow grind there.

I suspect it would be pretty easy for the USN to prevent any shipping headed for Russia to pass through the Baltic. There's likely nothing the Russian navy could do to stop it. And it would be similarly easy for the US to prevent shipping from getting through the Bering Strait. That sounds like a really *cool* deployment.

A blockade is obviously an act of war, but I don't think it's escalatory enough for Russia to respond with tactical nuclear weapons. What would Putin do? Just start lobbing missiles at NATO bases?

People don't tend to think this way and partisan politics often entangles certain positions morally with grand narratives about what is good or right.

PS the book is from 1997.  From Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

&gt; In Europe:
&gt; 
&gt; Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad Oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term ""Moscow–Berlin axis"".[9]
&gt; France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a ""firm anti-Atlanticist tradition"".[9]
&gt; The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.[9]
&gt; Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".[9]
&gt; Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.[9]
&gt; Latvia and Lithuania should be given a ""special status"" in the Eurasian–Russian sphere, although he later writes that they should be integrated into Russia.[9]
&gt; Belarus and Moldova are to become part of Russia.[9]
&gt; Poland should be granted a ""special status"" in the Eurasian sphere.[9]
&gt; Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia, ""Serbian Bosnia"" and Greece – ""Orthodox collectivist East"" – will unite with ""Moscow the Third Rome"" and reject the ""rational-individualistic West"".[9]
&gt; Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[9]
&gt; In the Middle East and Central Asia:
&gt; 
&gt; The book stresses the ""continental Russian–Islamic alliance"" which lies ""at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy"". The alliance is based on the ""traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization"".
&gt; Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term ""Moscow–Tehran axis"".[9]
&gt; Armenia has a special role: It will serve as a ""strategic base,"" and it is necessary to create ""the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Yerevan-Teheran"". Armenians ""are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds"".[9]
&gt; Azerbaijan could be ""split up"" or given to Iran.[9]
&gt; Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and ""United Ossetia"" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.[9]
&gt; Russia needs to create ""geopolitical shocks"" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.[9]
&gt; The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including ""the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan)"" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan).[9]
&gt; In East and Southeast Asia:
&gt; 
&gt; China, which represents a danger to Russia, ""must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled"". Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking Tibet–Xinjiang–Inner Mongolia–Manchuria as a security belt.[1] Russia should offer China help ""in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia"" as geopolitical compensation.[9]
&gt; Russia should manipulate Japanese politics by offering the Kuril Islands to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.[9]
&gt; Mongolia should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia.[9]
&gt; The book emphasizes that Russia must spread anti-Americanism everywhere: ""the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S.""
&gt; 
&gt; In the United States:
&gt; 
&gt; Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".[9]
&gt; The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.[9]

This very smart Russian sifts through fantasies coming out of the Kremlin, including that somehow Russia can use military might to create another pole where America has made one with economic vitality, freedom, and interconnected economic ties.

""To submerge into the Russian government's mind and keep your sanity is quite hard. And there is a crazy mess of imperial revenge-seeking and Lenin quotes.""

""here the supporters of the 'one pole world' disruption say that Russia won't be alone, because for some unknown reason we'll get support from China, India, and some African countries...""

...

""Today the average Russian lives better than the average Soviet citizen -- he lives longer and in a more spacious apartment, eats well, he doesn't have to spend half of his life in queues. But the Russian government keeps pretending that Russia has lost when it stopped commanding other countries.""

Basically the crux that I think is on point is that Russia doesn't seem to understand that America's hegemony is due to our economic success which is based on things like our strong judiciary, freedom of speech, and fairness dealing with our allies both western partners and trading partners like China. Russia thinks ""why can't we be a center of power like America?"" The reason is Russia has nothing to offer it's neighbors but a military beatdown, and indeed if Russia did share American values then it wouldn't have a reason to be a seperate pole at all, it would be part of the main trading/power world and would be prosperous for it. The whole reason it wants to be a seperate power entity is it can't stomach freedom values like an independent press and rights for its citizens.",5585c082d86ac272e3c90779a0fe447aabc33f02,True,False,,,,,0,1650478460,,0,{},i5ifyzu,False,t3_u7uuo2,False,True,t1_i5i8iar,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7uuo2/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_20_2022/i5ifyzu/,1650478486,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650449660.0,

The truth is there is no such person in any political system and there is no one book to read when trying to tackle a regime. What English book would you recommend to Chinese or Russian students of America? I actually often run this exercise and ask students to come up with *the one book* to understand America they'd recommend to a foreign scholar - some highlights from the past several years include:

* The bible
* America a people's history
* a whole host of naomi klein novels
* The Price of Inequality (to be fair, stiglitz is always popular)
* Kissinger: world order (kissinger is pretty unpopular)
* White Fragility (don't get me started on the discussions about this book)

Anyway my point is if you read each of these books you'd actually probably get a good introduction to one slice of American society - but we typically assume our own societies are more complex than societies we study. The other thing you'll notice is that pretty much everyone will recommend a different book. Yes, some are more valuable than others, but it's very difficult to say that one is key, and over-indexing on one is as silly as saying that the bible will help you unlock the mind of Joe Biden. 

So if you want to understand Putin, how valuable is reading Marx? How valuable is reading Dugin? Medvedev? A Putin biography? I'm not sure. Read everything with a grain of salt and attempt to understand the geopolitical cause it was written for and context it was written in.

&gt;One of my comrades who came back from the frontline for reorganisation asked to briefly and clearly (without going into depths of warfare science) to sum up and express my thoughts that I listed in a discussion with him, revolving around my 'pessimism' towards the success of the 'second stage' of this SMO (Special Military Operation). - He believes someone might find this useful. I think that no one from those making decisions will pay any attention, but I made a promise, so here it is: 
&gt;
&gt;In short, let's evaluate the operational situation: 
&gt;
&gt;1. From our side, after the 'successful completion of the first stage of the operation' (which ended with a large-scale RETREAT from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts), a relocation and concentration of the forces in the Donetsk region of the frontline has occurred. Most likely (and according to the official statements of the political command of RF), this is precisely where they are planning to conduct the 'second stage, and complete the objective of totally clearing the territories of L/DPR of the enemy's formations. Obviously, they count on creating 2-3 offensive groupings with enough manpower, which, with concentrated support of all available aviation and the majority of artillery forces, will 'break through' the Ukrainian forces (which are still for some reason not appreciated highly enough), and destroy them in one large battle. 
&gt;
&gt;2. From the UAF side: the plans of RF AF are very clear to the enemy, and they do not at all consider their defeat inevitable. In fact, the opposite - UAF are planning to defend in their highly fortified positions, relying on old and newly created (RF AF gave them plenty of time for that) positions at assumed directions of the Russian Forces strikes (which are obvious - just look at the map). 
&gt;
&gt;Let's ask a question - can the supremacy of Russian AF in aviation and heavy weaponry guarantee a victory over the enemy (for whom the offensive plans are obvious?), who is prepared for defence, possessing a high moral spirit? My answer is - NO, not guaranteed. 
&gt;
&gt;Why? - My answer: 
&gt;
&gt;The 'supremacy' of Russian AF in aviation and artillery is quite relative. Since the enemy has a well-equipped and numerous military Anti-Aircraft capabilities, which severely limits actions of the tactical aviation capable of supporting its own troops on the battlefield. The enemy holds AN ADVANTAGE in terms of field and artillery reconnaissance (UAVs of various classes on nearly squad level). Their artillery has great weaponry and excellent trained personnel. And fighting against numerous Russian armoured vehicles - UAF (in defence) is quite capable of this due to massive amounts of anti-tank weapons among infantry (ATGM). 
&gt;
&gt;In conditions where Russian troops will have to storm one city agglomeration after another, numbers of troops come to the foreground. And in this regard, neither RF AF nor L/DPR AF have a serious advantage, unfortunately. 
&gt;
&gt;Let's imagine that the first line of defence of UAF south of lzyum and near Huliaipole is broken and our forces begin offensive in convergent directions. 
&gt;
&gt;Can they quickly link up in deep Ukrainian rears, creating two encirclement rings (inner and outer)? With a guarantee that the enemy won't break them immediately and won't create their own 'sailients' for the advancing forces? (Germans did this on multiple occasions in 1942 with our forces). 
&gt;
&gt;I doubt it. Why? - Because for that you need A LOT of detachments aimed not only for breaking through but also for firmly establishing in the territories. You also need a large amount of supply detachments. If the enemy had innumerous forces - you could partially ignore defence of communications. Yet UAF (thanks to mobilisation) have enough forces comparable to our own numbers. Moreover, the enemy has the ability to reduce the frontline and transfer freed forces towards endangered directions - RF does not have complete supremacy in the air simply due to a lack of numbers in attack aviation, and tiny numbers of attack UAVs. At the same time, the frontline near Donetsk can be held by the enemy with relatively small numbers thanks to excellent engineering equipment, developed over years, while our genius politicians were 'chewing Minsk snivel: 
&gt;
&gt;With this in mind, I presume that the general lack of forces will not allow the Russian command to conduct a 'deep envelopment in Dnipro region: They simply don't have enough manpower for this. So the offensive will be carried out in the shortest directions - in the north towards Slovyansk-Kramatorsk (at best, towards Barvenkovo), in the south - on the Uhledar-Kurahovo line. Both mentioned operational lines will inevitably lead our troops to face the large, highly fortified, and well-prepared defensive garrisons in numerous city agglomerations. In fact, the enemy still retains control over roads between them, which they can use to continue supplying their troops. 
&gt;
&gt;So, after a certain time, in this area, the same situation will repeat as in Rubezhnoe-Severodonetsk, Popasnaya, Avdeevka and Maryinka, where united forces are advancing extremely slowly and with huge losses (especially among infantry), or not moving at all (Avdeevka). 
&gt;
&gt;The enemy is more than happy with such a way to conduct combat operations. Why? - Because UAF need 1,5-2 (at best, 3) months to prepare significant reserves - not in the form of constant reinforcements into existing forces (they are already happening, supporting on a very decent level the numbers of troops directly engaged in combat), but in the form of detachments that can be used in other strategic directions, while Russian forces are 'bleeding; storming fortified cities in Donbas. 
&gt;
&gt;In the worst case scenario, we can repeat the situation similar to one that happened for the Wehrmacht during operation 'Citadel: While Germans were slowly gnawing through the deeply reinforced defence of soviet troops, wasting time and their saved reserves, Soviet command concentrated in the north (around Belgorod and Oryol) a large group of own troops not engaged in the battle. When it started a counter-offensive, Germans 'suddenly found out' that there was not enough power to simultaneously continue operation 'Citadel' and defend from counter-offensive of soviet troops. 
&gt;
&gt;The operation had to be ended and battered troops had to be returned to their original positions. And then, more or less orderly retreat (which did not always happen for Germans) behind Dnipro. With this in mind, I would also remind you that the so-called 'ukraine' is finishing its THIRD STAGE OF THE TOTAL MOBILISATION. They have manpower (200-300 thousand people) and equipment (a huge stream of all kinds of weapons from Europe and USA) to not only support a decent number of their own troops at the frontline, but also create new reserves. And create them in 'numbers' (even 100,000 people is around 50 BTGs, including reinforcements and rear infrastructures - so around 10 full-bodied divisions). 
&gt;
&gt;What about us? We are conducting recruitment into various private military organisations, recruiting contractors in enlistment offices, and... and that's all. L/DPR (in terms of mobilisation) are completely drained, and those who are 'still to be caught; will only replenish existing and future losses. Let's say, thanks to private companies we are able to create 10 (even 20) various squads and BTGs. And then? Losses taken in Donbas (storming more fortresses will result in these being VERY HIGH) will need to be compensated somehow. 
&gt;
&gt;In general, HOW can the Russian command in two-three months 'parry' a concentration of fresh UAF forces, for instance, at the borders of Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts? And if they start an offensive - what will we have to defend them? Police, 'alco-Cossacks' (all real Cossacks are already on the frontline), or regional militia? This regional militia has not yet even been created! No one is speaking about this... 
&gt;
&gt;Or did our military 'arranged in advance' with the enemy that they (the enemy) will act strictly within the plans of our Orthodox General Staff? In the first stage of 'SMP' this did not seem to happen at all. With serious losses for the participants. I don't think the second stage will be much different - Ukrainians are definitely not planning to act as 'boys for beating: 
&gt;
&gt;So, drawing a conclusion, I note: 
&gt;
&gt;Without conducting at least a partial mobilisation in RF it is impossible to conduct deep strategic advancing operations in so-called 'ukraine; impossible and extremely dangerous. We need to prepare for a long and difficult war, which will require all human resources, which are now uselessly wasted to have 'another flag over a city council' (Hostomel and Bucha showed how quickly the flags can be changed). 
&gt;
&gt;And yes, I would really like to be mistaken in my predictions for the operation that has started (the 'second stage'). But the grande with which these hedonists that shat themselves on many occasions, these lying babblers, and mediocrities, are presenting it - is not giving me extra optimism. NO CONCLUSIONS from the failures of the first two months - in a strategic sense - have been made.

Imagine a series of wooden bridges that are known to be rickity as fuck, some might support the weight of an armored fighting vehicle crossing but most won't. Is it smart to craft a plan that relies on crossing those bridges? If they're in enemy territory, how do you even know beforehand if they will hold the weight? Nope, the smarter decision is to not use them unless you absolutely have no choice. 

Muddy fields work the same. Nobody in the attacking force will know if a certain field or cross country area is drivable until they reach it and perform route recon, ergo someone drives into first to test it and doesn't get stuck. But that's not even proof that nobody else gets stuck following the same path, let alone moving in wider formations like wedge or line (which is the point of moving off-road, it gives better tactical options). 

So for tactical planning, to knowingly move cross country in areas known to be very muddy can result in catastrophic effects. If they order units to off-road at which point even a small part, (let alone large) get stuck in mud, that'll cause major delays as they perform lengthy recovery operations (possibly under fire), leaving behind the stricken vehicle and crew, or possibly abandon/destroying their own vehicle to ensure the enemy can't get it. If they choose to risk off-roading they either have to accept high losses and have the overall combat strength to get away with it, or they give orders to stay on the roads as much as possible. Which keeps them in column formation with the most limited amount of frontal fires, in an obvious route, that's channelized and easy to defend. With driving down roads being way more dangerous at least it's more consistent, and that allows them to plan for it (like using heavy fires to make up for narrow front).

From the defenders viewpoint, mud is still a hassle but not as bad as they can test the ground around and behind them before the action starts to know what is and isn't drivable. That way they can mass defenses on the areas that are drivable and do economy of force defenses in the areas that aren't. They also will have less issues on roads behind the front lines because they're interior lines of communication and besides air interdiction or artillery H&amp;I fires, they're safer from the threat the attackers face relying primarily on roads.

Oh it definitely is. Why is it not? The sun will still rise over Ameican corn fields if they do abandon NATO. If they don't, there won't be any corn fields for the sun to rise over. You can't just state that something is rational. Comitting national suicide for countries on the other side of the world isn't ever going to be rational unless the implication is that you discourage the other side to not be a hawk. If Russia goes insane and invades a NATO country, it's no longer rational to defend them, because the only rational part was the deterrence. The actual defense is irrational.

&gt; But there is NOTHING automatic about US and NATO launching a war against Russia over sometime Russia did in Ukraine.

This is true. It's also true that the President can abandon NATO on his own if he wishes. It's the rational thing to do if are risk averse and concider US citizens first. We're talking about the certain death of the majority of the population here. International treaties aren't necessarily going to be worth much when stakes are this high.

Russia will be less likely to make the situation happen in the first place, because of implication that the US will retaliate even if it's not rational. For this to actually work, there has to be some kind of proportional response to a nuclear strike in Ukraine by Russia. It's futher beyond the red line than if they televised a holocaust of Ukrainian people for the whole world to see. The use of nuclear weapons against a non nuclear power is literally that much of an escalation, because it shows what they're willing to risk to force others to do what they want. If the ""threat"" to retaliate becomes uncredible, Russia might decide to call the bluff. **A Russia that is crazy enough to use nukes against Ukraine combined with a US craven enough to not retaliate is fairly likely to call the bluff of NATO as well**.

WW1 started because a bunch of countries in Europe had overt military alliances with one another, so one declaration of war triggered others. 

WW2 started because France and UK, who were in a military alliance with Poland, both publicly told Germany if they invaded that would mean war. 

WW3 was thought to be likely started when a NATO member, part of a large military alliance, would be invaded by Warsaw Pact, another large military alliance.

You seeing a fucking pattern here? But there are no military alliances been NATO and Ukraine. In fact, the opposite has been said, before the war and during it: NATO will not militarily intervene.

[],False,,nuclearselly,,,[],,,,text,t2_v479g,False,False,"&gt;There's clearly established red lines that would lead to nuclear escalation

I don't think these red lines are as clear as you suggest.

The best comparison we have for the current conflict, are where the US specifically has threatened or planned to use nuclear weapons in the field against non-nuclear armed opponents.

This nearly occurred in the Korean War, the Vietnam war and was explicitly threatened in the 1991 and 2003 wars with Iraq.

In the first of those 2 situations, nuclear weapons were seen as a way of regaining momentum in a stalled conflict. The latter were coercive threats that were used to persuade Saddam to not use chemical or biological weapons in the field (as had been used in the war with Iran).

In all of the above cases, I think there is an assumption (probably correct) that the US would not have resorted to them. In Korea and Vietnam, the use of nukes was pushed by generals in the field and resisted by the political leadership in the white house.

We can't really make the same assumptions about Russia's 'red lines' for a few of reasons.

1. All of the conflicts I've referred to have been far from the US homeland. Ukraine however is next to Russia, and Crimea especially is considered part of Russia at this point. Would the US have been so hesitant to use nuclear weapons in a stagnated war with Canada for control of the Great Lakes area?
2. Political leadership beholden to an electorate had the final say. Russia does not have this concern.
3. In the case of Saddams Iraq, the US had a comfortable conventional advantage. The fact that Russia has performed so poorly in Ukraine makes me believe nuclear escalation is *more* likely as the Kremlin runs out of options to save face.
4. Civilian casualties are clearly not a concern for Putin. Flattening large areas with conventional weapons is much different from doing the same with a nuke. If your using sub-strategic weapons especially, the direct impacts are going to remain very local and not something the wider international community have much to be directly concerned about.

I still don't think this conflict will turn nuclear. I do see how there is a path for it to turn nuclear, and I don't think the international community will have the ability to stop it from doing so if those in the Kremlin make a choice to do so.",1b840db2ca420819f52fa714e1812320ad7f9342,True,False,,,,,0,1650472221,,0,{},i5hzoyh,False,t3_u7uuo2,False,True,t1_i5hsaol,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7uuo2/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_20_2022/i5hzoyh/,1650472237,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650443421.0,

Specifically, because Russia has viewed Crimea as part of the country for a number of years. This is where we get into the threshold of using nuclear weapons to directly defend your own countries territorial integrity and we have no precedent where a nuclear-armed state has had to face such an issue in the past.

One of the biggest attractions of nuclear weapons is that your territory becomes essentially immune to invasion by conventional forces. And if you can't use nuclear weapons in that situation (where you have no conventional means to repel an attack) it makes little sense to possess them at all.

I don't think Russia would escalate to that level for the portions of Eastern Ukraine it occupies, but Crimea raises the chances significantly.

We also need to remember that Russia has recent doctrine that points to doing exactly this (escalate to de-escalate), and the use of tactical nuclear weapons to directly counter a large conventional military force is not the kind of strategic nuclear threshold that Cold War powers were most fearful of crossing.

Or they do not advance at all (Avdiivka).
The enemy is ""more than satisfied"" with this way of fighting. Why? - Because the Ukrainian Armed Forces need another month or two (three months at most) to prepare large reserves - not in the form of constant reinforcements to the active troops (they do so continuously, maintaining the number of units directly involved in combat at a fairly high level), but in the form of new units and formations that can be engaged in other strategic directions while the Russian forces ""bleed"" by storming the fortified cities of Donbas.

In the worst-case scenario, we could have a repeat of the situation that arose for the Wehrmacht during Operation Citadel (Kursk Bulge). While the Germans, slowly gnawing at the deep-echeloned defense of the Soviet forces, were losing time and using up the accumulated reserves - the Soviet command concentrated to the north (in the area of Belgorod and Orel) a large grouping of their own troops, not involved in the battle. And when it went on the offensive - ""suddenly it became clear"" that Germany had no forces to continue simultaneously the operation ""Citadel"" and to repel counter-offensive of the Soviet troops. The operation had to be rolled back and the exhausted troops had to be returned to their initial positions. And then in general more or less orderly (which the Germans did not manage to do everywhere) - to retreat behind the Dnieper.

In this regard, I remind you that the so-called "" ukraine"" is completing the THIRD STAGE OF GENERAL MOBILIZATION. It has the human resource (200-300 thousand people) and technical capability (a huge flow of various weapons from Europe and the USA) not only to maintain sufficient numbers of its troops at the front, but also to create new reserves. And to create them ""in formidable quantities"" (even 100 thousand people is about 50 battalion tactical groups, including the means of reinforcement and logistics infrastructure - that is about 10 full-strength divisions).

And what about us? We have recruitment to various PMCs, recruitment of contractors to the military recruitment office and... And that's it... LDNR (in terms of mobilization) are "" exhausted "" - and those ""who can still be grabbed"", God willing, will be able to supplement the already suffered and future losses.
Suppose one manages (at the expense of PMCs) to create another 10 (even 20, which is unlikely) units of various kinds and BTGs. And then? The losses incurred in Donbass (during the storming of the next ""fortresses"" they will definitely be VERY HIGH) will also need to be somehow compensated.

In general - HOW can the Russian command in a month or two ""counter"" the concentration of a force of fresh AFU formations, for example, on the borders of Kursk and Belgorod regions? And if they go on the offensive, how will they be repelled? With combined units of the police, with units of the ""alko-cossacks"" (all real Cossacks are already at the front) or the regional militia? The regional militia has not even been created yet!!! No one is even bringing it up...

Or has our military ""agreed in advance"" with the enemy that he (the enemy) will behave strictly within the plans of our glorified General Staff? At the ""first stage of the SMO"" this did not work out at all. With significant losses for the parties involved. And I do not think that the ""second stage"" will be any different - the Ukrainian military is clearly not going to act as ""whipping boys"".

Thus, to summarize, I note:

Without at least partial mobilization in the Russian Federation, deep strategic offensive operations in the so-called ""ukraine"" are both impossible and extremely dangerous. We need to prepare for a long and difficult war, which will require all the human resources that are being squandered now for the sake of ""a flag over another city council"" (how quickly one can ""change the flags"" - Gostomel and Bucha will not let you lie).

And - yes - I would very much like to be wrong in my predictions about the operation that has begun (""the second stage""). But the way in which the hedonists who have already shat themselves (in all spheres) many times, lying chatterboxes and mediocrities ""are presenting it"" it does not inspire me with additional optimism.

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,[],,,,text,t2_dg31a,False,False,"Today's post by Igor Strelkov, pessimistic as ever about Russia's prospects in this war:  

One of my comrades, who returned from the front for reorganization, asked me to briefly and easily (without going into the jungle of military science) summarize and present my thoughts that were expressed in the conversation with him and concerning the reasons for my ""pessimism"" concerning the success of the ""second (""concrete"") stage of the ""SMO"". - He thinks it might be useful to someone. I don't think anyone (of the decision-makers) will pay attention, but I promised and, therefore, I am keeping my promise.

So, briefly assessing the operational situation:

1. From our side: after the ""successful completion of the first phase of the operation"" (which ended with a large-scale retreat from the territory of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions), there is a redeployment and concentration of forces on the Donetsk section of the front. Apparently (and according to the statements of the political leadership of the Russian Federation), it is here that it is planned to implement the ""second stage"" and solve the task of complete purification of the territory of the LDPR from the enemy forces.
Apparently, the calculation is to create two or three sufficiently large strike groups, which, with the concentrated support of all air forces and most of the artillery, will ""grind"" the opposing Ukrainian forces (which are still estimated low for some reason) and defeat them in one big battle.

2. On the part of the AFU: the plans of the command of the RF Armed Forces are well known to the enemy and the enemy does not consider the defeat of its forces inevitable. On the contrary - the AFU intends to defend at its heavily fortified positions with reliance on previously and newly created (the command of the RF Armed Forces has given them enough time) fortified positions in the anticipated strike areas of the Russian troops (and they are obvious - it is enough to look at the map).

Let's ask a question: does the superiority of the Russian Armed Forces in aviation and heavy weapons guarantee a victory over the enemy (for whom the plans of attack are obvious), prepared for defense, having high morale? My answer is NO, it does not.

Why? - The answer is:

The ""superiority"" of the RF Armed Forces in aviation and artillery is very relative. Because the enemy has a well-equipped and numerous air defense system, which seriously limits the effectiveness of tactical aviation that can support its forces on the battlefield. The enemy has an advantage in field and artillery reconnaissance assets (drones of various classes are already practically at platoon level). And its artillery is well-equipped and well-trained personnel. And against the numerous Russian armored vehicles - the AFU (in terms of defense) is quite capable due to the really huge number of anti-tank weapons in the hands of the infantry (ATGM).
When the Russian troops will have to storm one urban agglomeration after another, the number of manpower comes to the fore. Alas, the RF Armed Forces and the LPR Armed Forces do not have a serious advantage in this respect.

For example, after overcoming the first line of AFU defense south of Izyum and near Gulyai-Pole, our troops begin to advance in converging directions.

Can they quickly join deep in the rear of the Ukrainian grouping, creating (""classic"") two rings of encirclement (external and internal)? Is it guaranteed that the enemy will not immediately break through them and create their own ""cauldrons"" for the advancing troops? (The Germans did this more than once in 1942 with our troops).  

I express my doubts. Why? - I answer: because it requires MANY units and formations, not only for breakthrough, but also for firmly securing the territory. And also a large number of supply units. If the enemy had few forces, the protection of communications could be partially ignored. But the AFU (thanks to mobilization) has enough forces - comparable to the number of our troops in the theater. In addition, the enemy has the ability to reduce the front line and redeploy the freed forces to threatening directions - the Russian Federation simply does not have complete air supremacy because of the insufficient number of strike aircraft and negligible number of strike drones. At the same time, the enemy can hold the main front line near Donetsk with relatively small forces at the expense of superior engineering equipment produced over many years while our genius politicians were wasting time on Minsk agreements.  

In this regard, I assume that the general lack of forces will not allow the Russian command to carry out ""deep coverage in the Dnieper (Yekaterinoslav) area. - Therefore the offensive will be conducted ""along the shortest possible lines"" - from the north to Slavyansk-Kramatorsk (maximum - to Barvenkovo), from the south - on the line Ugledar-Kurakhovo. Both of these operational lines inevitably lead our troops to bog down in the heavily fortified and occupied by large, prearranged for the defense continuous urban agglomerations. Moreover - between them the enemy has enough roads, which he can use to supply his troops.",5b039b28d23aeee9e5ad9cd10d99885bfdaccfa3,True,False,,,,,0,1650470569,,0,{},i5hvegu,False,t3_u7uuo2,False,True,t3_u7uuo2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7uuo2/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_20_2022/i5hvegu/,1650470585,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650441769.0,

The funny thing is before the invasion there was actually a fair amount of pro-russia people/ bots who were clearly trolls and they were in a fair number but the mods didn’t ban them, you just kind of learned to downvote them and move on.

But after the invasion the sub kind of swelled back up into activity again and it always felt like people got hysterical, early on in the invasion of you said anything not even negative but just not agreeing with some factual info about what actually is happening you’d be called a “bot”.

I’m very pro Ukrainian and I got called a bot.

There’s too much hopium there too, the comments where people are screaming “go south and take Crimea and after that push as far into Russia as oossible” are just delusional.

There was a comment chain where people were kind of one upping each other someone said I think the Ukrainian casualties are 1:3 then someone responded “more like 1:5”

And then most upvoted someone says “no I feel it’s at least 1:7 but it could easily be 1;10 or more”

The place is positive and it’s great to take a break from places that have actual troll comments but the fact you feel you get distorted reality there is off putting.


Someone there recently was saying “ and the Ukrainians have more tanks than they started the war with”.

Some people there actually believe that. I tried to explain how this is dangerous, that Ukrainians are taking a lot of losses too and the west has been far too slow and too weak with giving heavy equipment or starting training programs.

I was just saying that this narrative going round that I even see some talking heads saying it is going to screw Ukraine in the end.

Because it’s great after bucha we are finally approaching giving what they need and faster but there will come a time that as the war causes inflation or cost of living issue it could get politically difficult. 

I was just explaining that the idea that Ukrainians have more tanks than they started with actually reduced the public pressure to get governments to act and give them heavy equipment. They actually really need a lot for counter offensives.

I was just told to shut the fuck up and also someone called me pro Putin.


Some people there just want to only see good news.

Yep. And people are ignoring all the other planning and considerations the Air Force has to consider

For instance, they have to treat Guam more like an aircraft carrier. Andersen AFB, despite being a big base, still has a finite amount of ramp space.

You can only put so many tankers and bombers on that base before you start interfering with ops. Now add fighters and stuff that might have to operate out of there, and you might now have to start pushing bombers further away or to other locations.

So there's going to be an optimization problem to get the most combat power you can get for the mission set you want.

Plus, add on the readiness rates they've seen - for instance, the B-1 is flat out horrible (I've seen them schedule 3, expecting only 2 to be available on the day of, and maybe getting lucky and getting 1 to be up to actually takeoff that day) and you start seeing why they don't want to even consider putting low readiness aircraft anywhere where they're just paper weights.

It’s incredible that for years he has invaded Ukraine sent regular units into donbass and we actually basically sanctioned the Ukrainians more than the Russians as we didn’t even allow them to buy the anti tank weapons systems needed to beat the Russians, I don’t know how they managed to hold up but according to Karber along with the “great raid” they actually had several other actions where they managed to populate Russian paratroopers graveyards heavily, from the gravestones in Russia l.

I don’t think it was from fear it’s that along with the capture of interests like Germany still pushing for nordstream 2 after Crimea, it was that the west wasn’t united and wanted an excuse not to have to do anything or have any issues.

that’s why they always played up the idea of “provoking” Putin, which ironically pleased Putin by making him feel powerful and he was probably gleeful his bluffing always worked.

He always counted on the west to be predictably ineffective or indifferent.


The very way we even acknowledge the “separatist” areas as legitimately separatist when the Russians literally threatene Ukraine with the insurgency after the EU / maidan issue.

And we have in record girkin  saying that the insurgency would have fizzled out like the protests in Kharkiv or Odessa without his hybrid war actions with Wagner and the security services ( then more spetsnaz and also Russian regular army units).

Putin clearly invaded for years sending in thousands of heavy weapons and ammunition calling it “humanitarian convoys”. We knew all this, military analysts plotted graphs showing the separatist would run low on heavy weapons and stop shelling until they got another “humanitarian convoy”.

Karber has a video with CSIS on this years ago.

I think it simply was an ugly truth that no action was wanted, leaders didn’t want short term issues.


It’s why they didn’t make a huge deal about every thing like they are now or spotlight it.


It led to this bizzare situation where people have drunk our own alternate narrative now understanding why it came about and that it isn’t true.

People seriously didn’t believe the Ukrainians would fight because “they rolled over in Crimea” not understanding they didn’t resist because we literally told them not to, we hung them out to try with the Obama admin saying “ don’t provoke Russia we will negotiate for you” of course delusionally or rather cynically after realising they couldn’t get united support for harder action, they played as if sanctions would somehow deter the land grab.

He sanctions did have an effect but Putin clearly would take Crimea for 10x the financial cost every time if it was handed in a platter bloodlessly and with such a propaganda victory, there was a reason he was crying and smiling afterwards.


I think all this was simply because of the political situation, even now if we had given all these things we have done in April months ago the Ukrainians would have probably collapsed the Russian army.

I think the Putin verstehe type germans and other Europeans wanting to not upset the energy issue influenced the weak reactions.

Because sure we can’t do a no fly zone ever, but we kept ceding the initiative.

Telling Putin we will only do x if you do y. Basically have the green light. Also if we had gone much harder much quicker that would have also smashed his abilities to achieve what he has. But it has often been too little too later.

I hope the west finally realised this, hope we train Ukrainians in the west in hand me down vehicles covertly in the westso that in months time we aren’t saying they need equipment but it’s take too long to train them. We can then roll out the crews with vehicles.

Also hope it’s the same long term for some older  western NATO planes.

And I hope the CIA is helping Ukrainians get some reaper drones crewed by assets to get round the rules while training the Ukrainians in how to use them, this has to be done so quick. It’s just wasting Ukrainian blood otherwise.


All this I’m saying I agree, all this talk about provoking Russia or adopting their language of “separatists” for the planned Russian military outposts they run head to toe is nonsense.

No, there's a technical difference. A reservist is someone who previously served or who has received training previously and is ready to be called to active service at short notice.

[],False,,NGAD_Driver,,,[],,,,text,t2_cuw2uer4,False,False,"&gt;FWIW the 426 gal tanks were planned and partially developed (CAD, wind-tunnel models, etc) but abandoned because they barely increased the jet's range due to the F-35's high fuel fraction (15% range increase on the F-35B; would've been worse on the A and C). Israel's still working on 600 gal tanks that are hoped to perform better, but obviously they're still vapourware for now and I don't think most nations would care to use them anyway if it increases operating costs due to lower fuel efficiency (and tankers are otherwise available).

IIRC, also rapidly ate up the airframe's weight for max takeoff/airborne weight

&gt; I agree overall that F-15EX procurement has its place, but this part implies that they tried and failed to integrate heavy external stores, when there's nothing to suggest as such. Ultimately the loadouts certified for Block 3F were simply just selected for utility and cost / schedule - you're rarely going to need 6x GBU-31s on one plane for example, but 6x GBU-12s / GBU-49s has a use case for CAS / COIN.

[They flew with GBU-31s on the wings](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/commercial-aerospace/article/14229593/f35-military-aircraft-completes-comprehensive-sdd-phase-flight-tests) during SDD - it was absolutely tested, as were other heavier loads on the wings. So it wasn't a preemptive schedule/cost thing, or they never would have even tried.

Moreover, the CAS argument is a poor one. The GBU-12 is an awful weapon to use for CAS. If they really cared about it, they would have integrated the GBU-54 LJDAM, which more or less replaced any GBU-12 usage during the 2010s.


&gt;This argument seems a bit flawed to me though; as far as I'm aware all F-35s ordered at this stage will be Block 4 jets with Tech Refresh 3 (which begins delivery next year with Lot 15, and forms the majority of Block 4's hardware upgrades). Depending on the order vs delivery period (I don't recall how exactly DoD annual budget requests match F-35 production lot orders - ie what lot the jets in the FY23 request are for) jets being ordered for FY23 might even possibly be delivered with the additional Block 4 EW hardware upgrades being delivered with Lot 17 in 2025.

TR3 is running into problems, according to [SECAF](https://www.airforcemag.com/kendall-current-f-35-block-4-issues-earlier-jsf-problems/):

&gt;Now, Kendall said, the Pentagon seems to be in a similar situation: The Air Force should be buying the F-35 that it needs—specifically the Block 4 upgrade with Technology Refresh 3, “which is having problems,” Kendall said.

That's the first time they've admitted they've had issues.

Also, don't forget that there are other non-TR3 hardware mods they've talked about: modifications for aft heavy weapons, and they've only started exploring what they need to do if they want to go with Sidekick, which may require further modifications.

There's been a lot of skepticism in the DOD about the JPO's Block IV timeline, which has already been stretched to the late 2020s, as well as claims of the timeline it'll take to convert older jets to Block IV standard, especially if the bay modifications desired aren't ready yet for a few more years and end up taking longer than expected. 

So they might not even get TR3 next year, or the full suite, and then will require brand new jets to go right back to the factory to get the rest of the hardware delivered.

It's easier at this point to just give up those spots to get our FMS orders to other countries and get them committed now. We have a few hundred Block 3Fs and are still getting quite a few more a year

&gt;I do 100% agree that the F-15EX is useful in this manner, but I do wonder how things would fare if some of the F-15EX budget was put towards accelerating payload certifications on the F-35; by paying for additional test fleet airframes, etc.

Like I've said before - what did they find from during those DT flights? After all, a lot of DT's job is to figure out whether the contractor's claims were valid, find deficiencies, and work w/ the program office to resolve issues and identify issues that can effect OT and the operational world.

So the question people should be asking, especially given all the challenges the airframe suffered during DT, is: How did the flights match the model provided by the contractor? Were they similar to what was claimed, or were they way off? Were there structural issues, similar to what we saw when the C had [excessive vibrations](https://www.defensedaily.com/navy-tackling-f-35c-vibration-problem/navy-usmc/) during catapult launch? 

How about flutter? Did they find issues that reduced the lateral asymmetry limit of the jet? 

Like you wrote above: they did do CAD &amp; wind model testing on lots of things that they wanted. And they flew with the heavier stores during DT. The question is, what issues did they find?

&gt;Overall I just feel like between the F-35A, F-22 and USAF NGAD (for air superiority and strike missions in contested airspace), B-21 (for heavy conventional bombing and carriage of bunker busters), B-52J (hypersonic / oversized weapon carriage) and F-16 / MR-X [the lower-cost ""clean sheet F-16 replacement"" being considered and decided on in 2028] (for homeland defence, etc), the F-15's role will be redundant relatively early in the F-15EX's lifecycle.

F-16 Replacement may or may not happen, so it'd be hard to hedge your bets on an airframe with a program that is still up for discussion. And the F-16 Replacement is to directly contend with the low end missions they once envisioned the F-35 to do, and hopefully also allow for the retirement of the A-10.

The B-52's only been seen carrying their hypersonic weapon tests on the pylons. Maybe they'll only carry a single one of those on the centerline of the F-15EX, but that's still potentially 100+ more aircraft that can carry them. With only ~70 B-52s still in service, and the potential for them to have to be based far away in a conflict in the Pacific (due to their size taking up ramp space where you might want to put other aircraft closer to the front), you might not have as many of them available on station if they have to keep cycling back long distances for re-arming. 

&gt;I know the F-15C/D fleet needs to be retired ASAP (and is planned to go in 2026), but the F-15E fleet is 8 years younger on average, has no current planned retirement date and IIRC has double the original F-15C/D's lifespan to begin with (though granted the GWOT would've dug into that), so it should be feasible to keep them flying through to the mid-2030s.

Yes, they've already said the F-15EX will replace the F-15C units, but they also said they will do missions more like the F-15E. The F-15E already exists with all of the above, and wasn't being replaced by any of the airframes above either, so they've got other visions for the EX - to include possibly replacing the E outright, as some people are thinking.",4a34c6e60df370857d9fdf75d0350409fa9d9e60,True,False,,,,,0,1650467791,,0,{},i5ho8sv,False,t3_u7g1m9,False,True,t1_i5hhcx2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7g1m9/air_forces_math_on_the_f15ex_and_f35_doesnt_add_up/i5ho8sv/,1650467808,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650438991.0,

I heavily chopped up the description into the title:

&gt; Gerry Doyle and Blake Herzinger join Jeffrey to talk about their new book: Carrier Killer: China’s Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles and Theater of Operations in the early 21st Century.

&gt; The group sits down to talk through China’s DF-21D and DF-26 missiles. Do they work? What do they do? What can they actually accomplish? How do navies adapt to the new threat environment? 

&gt; The group talks through the realities and the puffed up hype around these systems, and how they actually impact strategy and naval operations.

The Air Force's analysis?

Who cares about capacity - capacity is what a contractor claims their design could theoretically carry.

What matters is what is [actually](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51603d4e70b4cd8dfbf14decd1c50ce6-lq) cleared to carry - that's what developmental test does. They verify whether the contractor's claims were correct

It doesn't matter if the contractor claims the F-35's pylons can carry 5000 pounds - no one is asking the questions of:

* What happened when they did do that? Did it cause aircraft vibrations that were excessive? Did it cause flutter?
* Did the aircraft model provided by the contractor match the data that they actually found in flight? Was that model close, or way off, resulting in them having to scrap plans to carry more?
* Did they find issues with stores clearance?

[],False,,Dragon029,,,[],,,,text,t2_4wca3,False,True,"&gt; Note how the external fuel tanks were put on there, as if people would think these exist, when these don't even exist and have never been developed. What was that issue about range again? 

FWIW the 426 gal tanks were planned and partially developed (CAD, wind-tunnel models, etc) but abandoned because they barely increased the jet's range due to the F-35's high fuel fraction (15% range increase on the F-35B; would've been worse on the A and C). Israel's still working on 600 gal tanks that are hoped to perform better, but obviously they're still vapourware for now and I don't think most nations would care to use them anyway if it increases operating costs due to lower fuel efficiency (and tankers are otherwise available).

&gt; Note how the big weapons couldn't get get certified for external carriage - none of the big weapons particularly it seems. Why couldn't they certify heavier? What was that about the F-15 being able to carry big external weapons again?

I agree overall that F-15EX procurement has its place, but this part implies that they tried and failed to integrate heavy external stores, when there's nothing to suggest as such. Ultimately the loadouts certified for Block 3F were simply just selected for utility and cost / schedule - you're rarely going to need 6x GBU-31s on one plane for example, but 6x GBU-12s / GBU-49s has a use case for CAS / COIN.

&gt; the Air Force does not believe the F-35 of today can do all the missions of some other platforms (thus, needing these other platforms to remain modernized, capable, and ready), nor does the Air Force believe the F-35 of today is the F-35 they want (hence they'd rather slow production than buy a bunch of jets that need retrofits later), and that the Block IV capabilities are so critical to their use in the future that they'd rather buy fewer non Block IV jets and get capabilities in other areas in the meantime.

This argument seems a bit flawed to me though; as far as I'm aware all F-35s ordered at this stage will be Block 4 jets with Tech Refresh 3 (which begins delivery next year with Lot 15, and forms the majority of Block 4's hardware upgrades). Depending on the order vs delivery period (I don't recall how exactly DoD annual budget requests match F-35 production lot orders - ie what lot the jets in the FY23 request are for) jets being ordered for FY23 might even possibly be delivered with the additional Block 4 EW hardware upgrades being delivered with Lot 17 in 2025.

&gt;What's the F-15EX come with already? Oh, right - certification to carry and employ a LOT of different weapons, including some of the biggest and heaviest weapons in the US inventory that only the F-15E and bombers are cleared to carry.

I do 100% agree that the F-15EX is useful in this manner, but I do wonder how things would fare if some of the F-15EX budget was put towards accelerating payload certifications on the F-35; by paying for additional test fleet airframes, etc.

Overall I just feel like between the F-35A, F-22 and USAF NGAD (for air superiority and strike missions in contested airspace), B-21 (for heavy conventional bombing and carriage of bunker busters), B-52J (hypersonic / oversized weapon carriage) and F-16 / MR-X [the lower-cost ""clean sheet F-16 replacement"" being considered and decided on in 2028] (for homeland defence, etc), the F-15's role will be redundant relatively early in the F-15EX's lifecycle. 

I know the F-15C/D fleet needs to be retired ASAP (and is planned to go in 2026), but the F-15E fleet is 8 years younger on average, has no current planned retirement date and IIRC has double the original F-15C/D's lifespan to begin with (though granted the GWOT would've dug into that), so it should be feasible to keep them flying through to the mid-2030s.

Either way though, what's done is done and at the very least the F-15EX will help keep St Louis busy.",8ca159eccf1d481a582255fa7fb1dd80fa5283ce,True,False,,,,,0,1650465026,,0,{},i5hhcx2,False,t3_u7g1m9,False,True,t1_i5fhvgu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7g1m9/air_forces_math_on_the_f15ex_and_f35_doesnt_add_up/i5hhcx2/,1650465040,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650436226.0,

One potential mechanism to allow intervention with a decreased (but not zero) risk of escalation is for NATO forces to very publicly and clearly telegraph to the Russians that while they will enter Ukraine and shoot back at the Russians if fired upon, all the shootings will only occur by and on forces and aircrafts inside the Ukrainian borders.

His point is that the Marshall Plan worked because it was helped by a lack of internal fracturing around cultural lines. That the singularity of ""German"" culture meant that the plan could focus on rebuilding and expanding infrastructure, and not also needing to focus on explaining why Silesians should be considered people, and that women exist too. 

And that many of the countries in the Middle East were created without regard to cultural histories and traditions, and ended up splitting ethnogroups into different countries (Kurds in Iraq/Iran/Turkey/Syria) or forcing together disparate and hostile cultures into one government (Iraq). And thus, the Marshall plan wouldn't work.

1. Russia feels a historic insecurity about the geographic vulnerabilities of their homeland. The farther out they can build buffer states, the less vulnerable they are. If Ukraine, in whole or in part, were to be annexed or made into a puppet state, it's a gain for Russia's long term strategic security.
2. A LOT of oil was found in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Enough to make Ukraine a serious competitor with Russia for Europe's energy market. This would be a huge blow to Russia, since it's essentially a petrostate. 
3. Previous attacks in the Donbas and Crimea went pretty well; the Ukrainian army didn't do well, and the West complained but didn't do much in the end. 
4. Successful wars have historically boosted Putin's domestic popularity.

So, if you believe your enemy to be vulnerable enough that you can conquer them quickly (point 3) and you stand to gain better economic and geographic security (points 1 &amp; 2) for your nation and bolster your political position (point 4) to boot, then why wouldn't you invade?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are some major holes in all this, but since Putin is in his dictator bubble where no one tells him anything he doesn't want to hear, he wouldn't have known that. He just made his calculations and his ""math"" showed that invading Ukraine could have some huge upsides for the amount of risk involved. 

His actions are not those of a madman. His actions are those of a man who took a calculated risk based on pretty bad information. We shouldn't conclude, therefore, that he's wildly unpredictable and and acts without reason.

Besides, the U.S. doesn't have multiple carriers in the region - it has one, the *Ronald Reagan* (CVN-76), based in Yokosuka.

&gt;What is China going to use, their 50 J-20s?

No. J-20s are interceptors, not maritime attack aircraft. China would use:

\-Ground-based ASBMs: DF-17s, DF-21Ds and DF-26s

\-Maritime bombers: H-6Gs and H-6Js (armed with supersonic YJ-12s)

\-Maritime attack aircraft: JH-7s, JH-7As and J-15s (armed with subsonic YJ-83Ks)

\-Large surface ships: Types 052C (armed with subsonic YJ-62s), Types 052D and 055 (armed with supersonic YJ-18As), as well as modernized Type 051B and imported Russian Sovremenny (armed with supersonic YJ-12As)

\-Nuclear attack submarines: Types 093 and 093A (armed with supersonic YJ-18s)

There's no reason to think so.

Depends on the platform.

&gt;And people fall into the same trap with China as they do with Russia, looking into the numbers and assuming their soldiers will perform the same way Nato troops do.

China isn't Russia, and in the case of the Russo-Ukrainian war it's not as if numbers favor Russia in the first place.

Just to retrain a single Paladin platoon requires not only privates in gun crews learning entirely different vehicles, to include PMCS and use of every single system to include trouble shooting everything, but also NCOs who have to be subject matter experts on everything serving as section leaders, officers serving as platoon leaders.

Exactly. Venable has been rumored to have been heavily lobbied/influenced by Lockheed over the years, due to his repeat puff pieces about it, and this piece really highlights it. How can you use unit cost and assume that is the driving factor? How can you assume the F-35/F-15 mix isn't superior to the all F-35 mix? 

The Chief of Naval Operations of the US Navy has even admitted, in HASC testimony, that in wargaming exercises, they found the fourth + fifth gen mix to be superior to the alternatives.

It's almost as if the Air Force wargames and exercises and plans around these issues.

The old school Air Force mentality - of which Venable was - is so platform-centric that they ignore that war is a team sport.

The West and the US in particular should keep this in mind when it looks at its emphasis on air superiority.

Same is true with the F-16. A year ago you could have built up a perfectly good cadre of pilots. But today there isn’t even the will to send planes, so what good is it? NATO trained Ukraine the best it could, and prepared them to use weapons which seemed they would likely get. But the situation has changed so much it’s easy to say ‘why not x too?!?’

Please, if someone with a real military background wishes to correct me do so, but my recollection is that during the cold war, NATO doctrine was to answer a conventional soviet invasion with nukes, in spite of the fact that doing so would possibly lead to a full nuclear exchange.  We had this doctrine because planners thought that a full soviet conventional invasion would not be stoppable in the Fulda Gap by conventional means.

Unlike the Russian Air Force’s failure to achieve superiority during the initial weeks of the invasion, this should not come as a surprise for long-term Russian military analysts. The Russian Air Force has never prioritised close air support as a mission set, which partly explains the lack of targeting pods and investment in direct-attack PGMs. 

&gt; This was due to the Russian (and Western) assumption that the Russian Army’s preponderance of tanks and heavy artillery would give it the advantage in any ground conflict, provided that its ground-based air defences could keep NATO air forces at bay. It is the failure so far of the Russian Army to exploit its firepower advantage successfully in Ukraine that is the surprise. In this context, however, it is suddenly significant that even with local air superiority, the Russian Air Force is unlikely to be able to tip the balance against the Ukrainian Army in Donbas.

[],False,,Strydwolf,,,[],,,,text,t2_j7zmz,False,False,"Regarding how much time is actually required for training on Western equipment. First of all, the distinction should be made between *re-training* and *training of new personnel*. First is considerably faster than the second, with that being said the second is a process in itself. The major bottleneck is translation of manuals and technical documentation, but this can be done relatively quickly by a crew of professional translators (I myself did more than one adaptation of certain special literature), and also can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing people who are fluent in the language (especially English).

Let's take artillery as an example. This is based on my talks with not only active artillery commanders, but also professional artillery trainers. Re-training is very easy since the laws of ballistics is the same regardless of place of manufacture. 

To retrain artillery battalion from 2A18\36 to M777 (and eq.): 2 weeks maintenance\operation + 1 week fires
To retrain SPG battalion from 2S1\2S3 to M109 (and eq.): 3 weeks maintenance\operation + 1 week fires 

Note that the *number of battalions* you can retrain *in parallel* is only limited by the number of available artillery trainers you've got. We already have trainers that are familiar with the systems, and with some relatively minor help from the allied trainers the process can be organized, streamlined and started within the few weeks from initiation. 
Also note that this is a rather hasty schedule but acceptable in extreme conditions.

Furthermore, to hastily train a new battalion (from scratch, raw recruits pre-selected by affinity, promotion of experienced NCOs\officers for c&amp;c) is possible in two months time. Again, you can train several battalions in parallel. One battalion per freshly formed brigade.
Situation is similar\easier with tanks\APCs.

Key Takeaways

The next phase of the Russian offensive in Ukraine’s east has reportedly begun, largely with artillery and air bombardments supporting a few small-scale ground offensives.

Russian officials and media are likely preparing to declare victory in Mariupol in the coming days, possibly before Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal facility have been fully defeated.

The Russians may be attempting a single wide encirclement of Ukrainian forces from Izyum to Donetsk City or a series of smaller encirclements within that arc. It is too soon to assess the intended Russian scheme of maneuver.

Russian operations continue to proceed hastily, as if President Vladimir Putin has set an arbitrary date by which they must succeed. Putin may have decided that he will announce a Russian success and the completion of the operation on Victory Day, May 9. The haste with which Russian forces are moving may compromise the success of their operations.",3a7afcb8c9c7dfbc9c0d062fa522a66665993d1b,True,False,,,,,0,1650416033,,0,{},i5f5uz0,False,t3_u73gmx,False,True,t3_u73gmx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u73gmx/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_19_2022/i5f5uz0/,1650416050,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650387233.0,

That's not at all what I'm saying. We absolutely should believe they'll use nuclear force if their territory is violated. The red line for use of nuclear force has been, and will continue to be, whether Russia is invaded. Nuking someone preemptively to prove you'll use a nuke if you invade makes no sense, MAD is still very much intact.


&gt;How far would the U.S. be prepared to escalate if it were losing a war to Mexico because Mexico was receiving arms shipped in by foreign powers?

This is a nonsense analogy, so who knows what the geopolitical situation is within it, but the US wouldn't use nukes in anything but response to other nuclear use, or violation of territorial integrity. Neither of which is happening to Russia.

Ultimately about zero serious people think Russia's nuclear deterrence to invasion has changed from this.

I am of the view that #UkraineWar generally reduces the risk of a near-term military conflict over the Taiwan Strait, but new uncertainties are rising too. We need to keep eyes wide open to avoid sleepwalking into a war over Taiwan. A thread🧵: 

1/ The most desirable outcome for China remains peaceful unification. To Beijing, this means to avoid war &amp; use time to further build up material power, including military power. By the time China establishes clear military advantage, Taiwan and US would have to accept reality. 

2/ #UkraineWar puts pressure on this thinking in several ways: Believing the US-led West is using the war to destroy Russia, Beijing becomes more convinced an eventual showdown with the West may only be avoidable if China could change balance of power to its favor quickly enough. 

3/ However, #UkraineWar resuscitates the US/West. US may remain somewhat distracted, but China cannot be as confident as before about its projected surpassing of US in foreseeable future. A less sanguine projection promotes ""long-term pain worse than short-term pain"" thinking. 

4/ More important, China increasingly believes that even though China wants to avoid conflict, the US is becoming more desperate to undermine China by playing the Taiwan card. US efforts to strengthen ties with Taiwan are viewed as indisputable evidence of US strategic hostility. 

5/ Convinced of US' salami slicing strategy to erode China's leverage over Taiwan, Chinese experts argue a resolute response to implement China's red line before it gets further infringed would be necessary, otherwise US provocation would only be emboldened. 

6/ The mutual perception that ""ball is in the other's court"" is the reason for concern. US believes China is challenging status quo; China believes it faces growing US aggression, has less choice, and may sooner or later be forced to act. 

7/ Believing the US is emboldened by its perceived success in crippling Russia over Ukraine, Chinese experts see a greater danger of US going rogue and attempting more radical moves against China to similarly destabilize/destroy China. 

8/ The reported (now postponed) @SpeakerPelosi visit to Taiwan stimulates unprecedentedly tense Chinese discussion of need for very strong response. Many want a much tougher military reaction than before. If it led to war it is not up to us, is the increasingly popular sentiment. 

9/ Under this siege mentality, although China would prefer to have more time to develop better military preparedness, it believes it would have to do with what it has when push comes to shove. 

10/ Some public opinion leaders’ recent calls for the Chinese public to be psychologically prepared for a war over Taiwan may or may not be directed from the top, but it aligns with Mr. Xi's guidance that ""it is unrealistic to always want to live in peace and not want to fight."" 

11/ Chinese leadership may also be relieved to see Putin's war decision did not cause serious domestic instability in Russia. Rather, Russian people mostly rally around the flag and Putin becomes more popular. 

12/ This is important to the Chinese leadership whose top priority is to maintain domestic stability and popularity but faces growing pressure as more people raise questions about government competence in handling Covid, economy, and other pressing domestic problems. 

13/ As for Chinese experts, they watch #UkraineWar as a real-world simulation of a future US-China conflict. There is growing optimism that Russia is not losing despite fighting the entire West. 

14/ From this perspective, Russia turns out not really internationally isolated and its economy may survive sanctions; thus a much more powerful China would have a better chance to endure the consequences of a conflict and emerge victorious. 

15/ There's also the popular belief that a rising power needs to take a decisive move at the right historical juncture to effectively assert itself and establish international respect &amp; status; in fact, this might be the only way to shock the hegemonic West into reconciliation. 

16/ Admittedly, the top leader's view is what matters most but is never clear. Yet, the pressure to resolve the Taiwan issue comes from him. He links it to his goal of national rejuvenation &amp; has displayed interest in developing the capability to resolve the issue forcefully. 

17/ As a result, hawkish views easily set the public narrative by dominating discussion and getting little pushback. As domestic public narrative becomes more unitary, debates are rarely about the wisdom of coercive unification but how. Little room remains for different thinking. 

18/ As more people embrace the dominant view with no thorough debate of its defects and consequences, a self-reinforcing echo chamber can already set the collective machine of the state down a path not necessarily strategically planned or carefully scrutinized by anyone. 

19/ Somewhere down the path, the military option might start to appear appealing to decisionmakers. The machine of the state seems unconsciously drifting toward making the domestic public opinion environment conducive for the leadership to eventually make a consequential move. 

20/ This happens against the broader background where China as a nation is at a critical juncture struggling about if its future rests with seeking to work with the West or more openly countering the West. A military spark over Taiwan could immediately end any remaining debate. 

21/ Both sides need to understand the domestic perceptions underlying the increasing risk of US-China sleepwalking into conflict over Taiwan. Even an inadvertent Taiwan conflict could formally launch the world into two blocs &amp; major power wars. It's hard to overstate the stakes.",789fb8985aabf3b29b0c912b1ee80eb6a9ed702e,True,False,,,,,0,1650413277,,0,{},i5eze8m,True,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t3_u7ixz8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5eze8m/,1650413295,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650384477.0,
