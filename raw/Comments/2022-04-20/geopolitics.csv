Yet, Tehran appears to be coordinating with Moscow and will not do so without Russia's sign-off because Iran has recently agreed to let Russia control who it exports natural gas to and at what price the exported gas will be purchased.  The op-ed proposes that this bilateral coordination between Iran and Russia will enable Moscow to further throttle the inflow of natural gas to the European continent.

The article ends with an explanation of what this means going forward and declares that we are returning to a world of Great Power Politics. Despite this declaration, many factors contribute to an opposing view and the maintenance of a US led world order, such as slowing growth in Russia and China and the possibility of the overthrow of their respective governments.

[],False,,Harmonic_Strategy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cpdderd,False,False,"&gt;If these countries continue to supply Ukraine with weapons, they risk leaving themselves and Europe as a whole vulnerable to invasion should Russia emerge victorious and continue pursuing territorial ambitions (I don't think they'll do that even if they win, but many countries are understandably concerned about the possibility).

Russia's huge military was always reckoned to be ferocious in a fight. They probably would be in a defensive war (even now), but they have been incompetent at warfighting so far. There have been a lot of disasters, to put it simply. The 'special military operation' has produced more casualties for Russia in 2 months than the USA had in 2 decades of fighting in Afghanistan (or likely will soon, reliable numbers are lost in the fog of war). This is against a country with a fraction of the population and wealth of Russia.

The only European countries that border Russia and are not in NATO are Belarus, Finland and Moldova (did I forget any?). Belarus is already a Russian ally. Finland will probably join NATO soon, Russia's invasion changed the longstanding consensus there. Moldova is vulnerable to Russian aggression, but they are already a weak and divided border state. So Russian aggression won't diminish any of their support for Russia, their best case strategy is still the same - Belarus will still support Russia, Finland will now oppose Russia, and Moldova will still try to stay out of it.

For NATO countries the calculus is different. Russia is not going to invade Lithuania or Poland even if they have many fewer antitank weapons deployed (for example). Those countries would not be counted to defend themselves with just their army anyways. The entire NATO alliance would mobilize to defend them, starting with massive air support, rapid response divisions, etc. The resulting fight would be an ugly and catastrophic loss for Russia. Imagine Ukraine now, if they had hundreds of f35's flying from airbases deep in the interior, that alone would turn the tides.

Of course it could always lead to nuclear escalation even despite best efforts on all sides, which is why Russia probably won't attack NATO and also why NATO probably won't intervene directly against Russia. But that's not going to stop the flow of defensive arms to Ukraine. If anything the risk-reward runs the other way, to go all out supporting Ukraine now. Arms inventory buildup doesn't favor Russia either, typically an antitank missile is much cheaper to replace than a tank (especially counting crew training time).",f15717da2105fdae3bdabae7c826efde65483b2f,True,False,,,,,0,1650424029,,0,{},i5fnzle,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i5e4bwx,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i5fnzle/,1650424044,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650395229.0,
