Nope.  That's 100% your strawman.  And such moral judgements (""okay/justified"") are completely irrelevant here anyway.  Scream all you want about injustice; it changes nothing.

Anyone is free to go back up to my original comment in this exchange to see exactly where I called it:

&gt; If you think this is a *moral* argument, then you just have no idea how nation-states and geopolitics work, and you don't know what a humanitarian and anti-war argument looks like (liberal).  You might want to brush up on these things.

I mean, even the U.S. government and the mainstream media very much acknowledged the existence and to a large degree the influence of those neo-Nazis right up until recently when it became very convenient not to.  The U.S. and Ukraine were literally the only nations who opposed a U.N. resolution condemning fascism.  The U.S. even acknowledged it was supporting the neo-Nazis and passed legislation making it illegal for the funding it provided Ukraine to go to them (2015)...and then immediately reversed that decision in 2016 and made it expressly legal to fund neo-Nazis again.  If you're ""checking your notes"" then you need to take WAAAAAAAAAY better notes.

&gt; Russia stoking separatists in Donbas is A-OK?

In other words, you support ""Ukrainian people"" overthrowing their government, but you do NOT support Crimean, Donetskian, and Luhanskian people overthrowing their government locally and declaring independence.  Why the inconsistency?  You support the U.S. providing all kinds of aid including ""lethal aid"" to Ukraine's new Maidan-formed government, but not Russia providing the same kinds of aid to Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk.  Why the inconsistency?

&gt; The Ukrainian people wanted to move towards the EU

Kyiv and western Ukraine wanted this.  People in Crimea, Donbas, and places like Odessa very much didn't.  Your support of established national borders (state oppression) over what people actually want is pretty telling.

&gt; In eastern Ukraine, Russia overtly worked to sow dissent in order to take over

And the U.S. overtly worked to sow dissent in order to move Ukraine toward NATO membership...well, really *de facto* membership and threatened future membership, as it had no chance of becoming a *de jure* NATO member anytime soon.  The U.S. overtly worked to sow dissent in order to move Ukraine *away* from Russian economic relations (not just toward the EU, as the forced choice was either accept subjugation to IMF austerity and trade with the EU while breaking ties with Russia, or continue to trade with Russia and accept Russia's deal of additional subsidies).  I mean, Russia even expressed willingness to negotiate a situation in which the EU, Ukraine, *and* Russia were part of a trade deal, but U.S./NATO/EU wouldn't touch it).

Macron thinks there is a relationship with this man, Putin.  There is no relationship to be salvaged. He is a despot, a war criminal, he is the designer and director of the horror in Ukraine. He sustains his ridiculous lies to the world and his people that he then uses to justify breaching Geneva Conventions, purposefully killing and maiming civilians and holding them hostage, besieged in cities, to die from starvation and cold.  Macron is a fool to think he can negotiate with this barbarian Putin. Putin’s ideology is to negotiate from strength. Macron is negotiating for self interest, for him in terms of re-election and his nation for fuel deals from Russia.

The Germans and French sold out Ukraine in 2014. They were driven by self interest and appeasement in order to secure fuel from Russia. The principle of sovereignty was a side issue.  That’s why Putin is back again. He wasn’t faced with power and force but weakness which he exploited. Macron learned nothing and should not be trusted to negotiate for Europe nor Ukraine.

Negotiating with Putin to end his War is like the police negotiating with a mass murderer who continues killing unless his demands are met and he is exonerated.

Putin **IS** a war criminal, he has planned and directed his forces in an international war crime, the crime of aggression, and has used war crimes, crimes against humanity and probably genocide to achieve his aims.  SO call him a War Criminal.

How can calling him out for what he is be damaging to relationships when Putin as lied to the international community, the UN, and has used his appointed higher ranking officers to lie to the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly.

Yea well aware of this, let me repeat the claim you're willing to stand by, with the exact same emphasis I gave before:  


&gt;**Many** ~~Waffen-SS~~ **Wehrmacht** soldiers in WW2 massacred civilians in their thousands were also 19.

So just do a quick calculation of how many soldiers there were in the Wehrmacht and how many dead that would be?

I'm not downplaying the involvement of the Wehrmacht, I'm well aware they participated en masse in the facilitation and enabling of the Holocaust. but the individual soldier didn't necessarily partake or witness, thousands being massacred.  


&gt;As for my sweeping views on the Russian Military as a whole: there are many options. Deserting. Not signing up. Surrendering. Shooting your own. Refusing to fight. Sabotaging war efforts.

And how the hell do you know how this person met their end? Or the circumstances by which they entered the country? Given all the madness we've been seen so far coming from Russian POW accounts of the cluster fuck that spilled over the border?

&gt;Contextually yes it's very hard, and life threatening to stand up for what is morally right and courageous in this moment.. but those who don't and abet war criminals, shall share the same fate.

That's strange because you didn't find it very hard to skip straight to

As for my sweeping views on the Russian Military as a whole: there are many options. Deserting. Not signing up. Surrendering. Shooting your own. Refusing to fight. Sabotaging war efforts.

Those who have surrendered to Ukrainian forces, or actively donated tanks and trucks have my admiration.

Russians calling for an end of the war and protesting in the streets, despite mass police violence have my admiration.

We also see many examples of refusing to fight and sabotaging infrastructure from the Belarusian Army, who also have my respect and admiration.

No you haven't

&gt; We already have complete information

No we don't, we absolutely dont and this is a moronic statement. 

Russia has been fucking up badly since day one, I know because I've been following it all along and seeing the results since day one. I've been here with everyone else pointing out their fuckups, even making a few guesses. But they're just that, _guesses_.

I also remember on day one a bunch of morons spreading footage from DCS screaming about the Ghost of Kyiv, and how if anyone didn't believe in the Ghost of Kyiv they were a Russiaboo. 

I also, quite vividly, remember watching a 6 year old die on an operating table in HD video. And the medical professionals breaking on video, and I had to take a step back from trying to keep up with everything because I knew this was the tip of the iceberg. Now the rest of the world got upset about kids dying a couple days later round about number 19 when they got a nice magazine cover photo to show the world. I'd been warning, quite helplessly, about what was coming once Ukraine had made it quite clear they were going to fight. The Russians have form in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Syria now and they have no problems with brute force. Thing is, fighting is the right choice. It what I'd do if I were Ukrainian, because fuck being rolled back under the Iron Curtain again. But it also meant Russia was going to try to kill everyone. 

The only thing I've been sure of all along is a massive loss of life and how a looming humanitarian crisis is forming for both Ukraine and the regular people of Russia over the next decade, because I'm not watching this war like a fucking sports game with winners and losers. It's a fucking war. And we won't know the details of why Russia has ballsed up so bad for quite a while yet, because there is such a thing as waiting for complete information before drawing a conclusion. That doesn't change the outcome and it doesn't mean I'm partial to one side.

So, because of that little girl whose life I saw snuffed out, an image that's probably going to stick with me for a long time: you can take that Russiaboo shit you fucking child and shove it so far up your ass you trigger your fucking gag reflex.

Most Helpful I've found:  
Kupiansk Mayor Hennadii Matsehora was elected in 2020 from the Opposition Platform – For Life party. It is/was Ukraine’s largest pro-Russia party formerly led by Viktor Medvedchuk, the Ukrainian Oligarch with deep ties to Putin’s inner circle who claims Vladimir Putin as his child’s godfather. Medvedchuk was arrested in May 2021 and charged with treason for trying to plunder Ukrainian state resources in Crimea and backing the separatists in Donbas. He also owned three major TV stations which were shut down for national security concerns of waging hybrid war on behalf of Russia.  
He was under house arrest until Feb 27, 2022. Three days after Putin invaded Ukraine Medvedchuk escaped house arrest. Around March 8th the Opposition Platform - For Life booted out Medvedchuk out of the party and denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was after sanctions were placed on the party that made it difficult to fund their primarily pro-Kremlin political activities. They were one of the handful of pro-Kremlin political parties suspended after martial law was declared due to the invasion by Russia.  
Medvedchuk was widely believed to be Putin’s handpicked President of Ukraine if the initial invasion of Ukraine succeeded in toppling the government.  
The mayor of Kupiansk belongs to this party of Medvedchuk, and was charged with treason by the Ukrainian government on February 28th, 4 days after the invasion started and one day after Medvedchuk fled. The mayor is charged with assisting Russian troops with food, fuel, housing and transportation. So, I don’t think it’s as simple as “I tried to save lives.” Seems more like he wanted Kupiansk to be Russian. There are a few videos of alleged locals in Kupiansk chasing down an SUV with the Z prominently displayed. Indicating at least a few locals do not agree with the mayor. Considering he is in Ukraine and actively and willingly helped another country that is invading his own, I could see why it could be considered treason.  
Does the SBU have his daughter? Hard to say. Do they have reason to believe she is also “allegedly” committing treason and helping the invaders? Possibly.

Then you saw what was actually happening. You saw Russia attacking a former ally, unprovoked. You probably bought into the Russian propaganda for a while. They're Nazis, you tell yourself; Putin said so. Then you watched more videos of how this war was actually going, all the shelling and bombing of civilian targets. That theatre in Mariupol. You might even still be in denial. ""Mother Russia wouldn't do such a thing!"", you say to yourself as you watch videos of children dying at the hands of Russian aviators and artillerymen.  What about that little girl who was shot through the face by a Russian soldier? What about that mom screaming in agony when her little girl was killed by Russian mortar fire?
