Elliot Ackerman spoke with a retired US Marine fighting with the Ukrainians and discussed his observations from the battlefield.

Here are some of the most important observations:

The  The Tank in Attack Era may be over.  

&gt;""When I mentioned to Jed that I’d fought in Fallujah in 2004, he said that the tactics the Marine Corps used to take that city would never work today in Ukraine. In Fallujah, our infantry worked in close coordination with our premier tank, the M1A2 Abrams. On several occasions, I watched our tanks take direct hits from rocket-propelled grenades (typically older-generation RPG-7s) without so much as a stutter in their forward progress. Today, a Ukrainian defending Kyiv or any other city, armed with a Javelin or an NLAW, would destroy a similarly capable tank.

There is an adage that goes, you fight your doctrine.  American military doctrine is the evolution of the old Prussian doctrine of warfare.  Empower your officers through training and tactics to act with initiative to give you a great advantage in speed and use that ability to act faster than your enemy to defeat them.  Here he gives an example of how Russia's way of fighting war isn't suited for these types of tactics.  

&gt;This brought Jed to the second subject he wanted to discuss: Russian tactics and doctrine. He said he had spent much of the past few weeks in the trenches northwest of Kyiv. “The Russians have no imagination,” he said. “They would shell our positions, attack in large formations, and when their assaults failed, do it all over again. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians would raid the Russian lines in small groups night after night, wearing them down.” Jed’s observation echoed a conversation I’d had the day before with Andriy Zagorodnyuk. After Russia’s invasion of the Donbas in 2014, Zagorodnyuk oversaw a number of reforms to the Ukrainian military that are now bearing fruit, chief among them changes in Ukraine’s military doctrine; then, from 2019 to 2020, he served as minister of defense. Russian doctrine relies on centralized command and control, while mission-style command and control—as the name suggests—relies on the individual initiative of every soldier, from the private to the general, not only to understand the mission but then to use their initiative to adapt to the exigencies of a chaotic and ever-changing battlefield in order to accomplish that mission. Although the Russian military has modernized under Vladimir Putin, it has never embraced the decentralized mission-style command-and-control structure that is the hallmark of NATO militaries, and that the Ukrainians have since adopted.",a0a2f868ad2f056e6a3d73bc3554a1b1b5a9591a,True,False,,,,,0,1648424800,,0,{},i2di3ic,True,t3_tpvwj2,False,True,t3_tpvwj2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tpvwj2/ukraines_threetoone_advantage_what_foreign/i2di3ic/,1648424814,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648396000.0

The hawks in the US administration are pushing for complete victory - removal of russian forces from all of Ukraine's territory (including Crimea), integration of Ukraine into the EU and eventually NATO, continued sanctions against Russia, and the end of its gas and oil exports to Western Europe.

A negotiated end to the conflict with a neutral Ukraine as proposed by moderates and realists would be seen as a strategic loss for the US as they would be in a worse position than they were before the start of the war, with Ukraine drifting closer to the West and NATO advisors already working to integrate its forces into the alliance. 

The political reason is that a negotiated end would expose the Western governments to accusations of weakness for not punishing Putin for his aggression.

The melting of the Arctic is unlikely to affect geopolitics in any substantial way until it's ice free in the winter, let alone needing ice breakers in the summer. Which will likely take many decades, perhaps centuries if it happens at all.

Why? Because the main advantage to Arctic travel would be faster transport from Asia to Europe, and potential new sources of oil. Neither of which would be profitable unless there was reliable and predictable access that wouldn't experience unexpected shutdowns due to weather which could cost billions depending on the investments that would be required.

The Russian section of the Arctic would also force every nation wanting access to be reliant on Russian search and rescue in the vain hope they would be impartial and competent enough to safely insure ship transport through the region. Except Russia's war in Ukraine destroyed any hope of that happening for the foreseeable future. So that's no longer an option.

As for Canada, they're becoming even more dependant on the US as they will no longer have a young consuming generation to support their aging demographics, increasing their need to export more to the US. Along with being geographically blocked from exporting Albertan oil except to US refiners in the south. Meaning Canada will have no leverage to control their artic territory except in partnership with the US. Not that reliable travel through the northwest passage is happening soon either.

While many countries may want to plan decades ahead for possible changes to geopolitics due to climate change, the Arctic is one of the least important in the near term or that important of an impact in the far future.",177b05252e7386b479eb5edbe1d3817d056818c3,True,False,,,,,0,1648368849,,0,{},i2aib5f,False,t3_tp3xfb,False,True,t3_tp3xfb,/r/geopolitics/comments/tp3xfb/hey_guys_im_16_and_this_is_my_first_ever_article/i2aib5f/,1648368860,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648340049.0

In some situations over emphasising the importance of a subject is interesting, but I find a comparison between an international relations theory and a biological system like the brain really misplaced. Don't do this, you're wasting your word count. No need for the faux intellectual interlude. It's not a movie trailer, just get to the point and use words that relate to your subject. You should not spend five paragraphs of preamble talking about cogs, brains, viruses, etc. 

&gt;Saying the quiet part out loud is deeply unpopular, however the simple fact of the matter is that it is in the short term interest of some nations to prevent a slowdown of climate change. Some prime examples of this would be that of Russia, Canada, and Denmark.

You're setting up a conflict here that doesn't exist. Everybody knows that climate change is a balance of short term vs long term interests. This isn't unpopular or new. It's the only reason we're discussing options. 

&gt;It was seen as unnecessary, a frozen hellscape filled with Inuit and polar bears.

You need to stop over emphasising the importance of every single thing you say. It detracts, rather than adds to, the emphasis you're placing. If every single thing you're talking about is the biggest or the most important, nothing is. It just looks like you're overstating everything you're saying, which you are. 

&gt;The newfound usage of previously uninhabited lands could bring about ~~truly gargantuan~~ cultural and social changes. While the ice caps melt to bring about reasonable temperatures closer to the poles, nations closer to the equator and with low sea levels will have to rely on nations like Russia and Canada to absorb an ~~massive~~ influx of migrants.

STOP IT!

&gt;This brings about an obvious existential threat to the existing liberal world order~~, and this realization in many powerful public officials has put the fear of god in them~~. Which is likely the reason for the very sudden shift in policy on climate change. While a few stand to gain in the short term, ~~everyone loses~~ most will lose in the long term.

Look, overall I can't tell what you're trying to say because you're speaking too broadly about too many different things. Some good ideas in there but this isn't actually how you write an article in either a newspaper opinion piece, blog or workplace report. You need to start off each of your paragraphs with a sentence that introduces the concept you're about to talk about. Your best paragraph (heavily edited by me) is this: 

&gt;For hundreds of years the use of the Arctic has been undervalued. The most apparent example of this is the acquisition of Alaska, or “Seward's Folly” as it would be called. William Seward was the main advocate for the purchase, knowing that the territory had a potential for resource wealth and would protect America's northern flank from Eurasian influence. It was seen as a frozen hellscape, populated by scattered Inuit and polar bears. But in 1898, 33 years after the purchase, gold was discovered and there began a great American gold rush. Seward's foresight is plain in retrospect, but his vision of the future looked ridiculous to his contemporaries. 

&gt; Our generation's folly may also lay in the Arctic....etc etc

Sometimes we think our ideas are new or original because we're not actually that familiar with other literature on the topic. I think that's what you have here in your article. And as you're 16 you don't have that pool of thousands of books or articles in the back of your mind, so you probably think that a lot of these talking points are  more original than they really are. You'll develop that over time though. 

But your wordiness and overemphasis of every topic you touch on is something you can fix now. Bring it back down to earth, it's not a debate where you have to make everybody believe this is the most important subject in the world. Because it isn't and everybody knows it's not. Decide what you're talking about, deliver the message in as few words as possible and keep your language choices way more grounded.

Think logically, it makes zero sense for the Russians to shell the humanitarian corridors, as these are the very key to their victory.

It's now known that had the Yes side won, Parizeau would have issued a UDI almost immediately. At that point, whether a UDI is legal/sufficient is immaterial; what matters is whether the government and people of Quebec believe and act as if it is, and whether Ottawa will use physical force to prevent such an interpretation. No one really believed in 1995 that the federal government would use the military to prevent secession. At that point international diplomatic recognition is what counts; France and the Francosphere would have quickly recognized Quebec as a sovereign country (quite possibly the same day as any UDi), and that would be enough to persuade the rest of the world over time.

You're a disgusting person for trying to paint normal people of Chinese ethnicity as essentially colonial exploiters. You use the same language Trump and other anti-immigrant politicians use to demonize immigrants. It'd the same logic and rhetoric used to pass the Chinese Expulsion Act.

Do you really think the food cart owner in Chinatown is trying to bribe the government? Is the laundry mat owned by a person of Chinese ethnicity stealing jobs?

Chinatown is not a self-sufficient town. It's literally a normal suburb that precedes the recent PRC controversies. What a racist you are. In fact, by grouping all people of Chinese ethnicity as Chinese agents, you're doing exactly what the CCP wants.

&gt;Your attitude and Chinese attitudes toward this behavior are the problem

Your racist attitudes of generalizing all people of Chinese ethnicity together is the problem. It's literally the same attitude the CCP has.

&gt;Why are Chinese in Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Indonesia? Fishing, lumber and minerals to send back to China while putting locals out of business. 

The history and existence of people of Chinese ethnicity in some of these countries precede the founding of even the ROC. You try to justify anti-Chinese hate and discriminatory actions toward people of Chinese ethnicity when they've never even been to China. 

You can say what Chinese natural resource companies are doing is wrong and separate out the normal person of Chinese ethnicity who isn't related to them. But you don't. Instead you try to justify the burning of Chinatowns and the killing of people of Chinese ethnicity. Shame on you.

&gt;Let me tell you something -- these people are not as stupid as Chinese like to think they are. There is going to be a backlash and a recalibration in the government back toward local indigenous people. It has already largely happened in Indonesia 

Here you are again justifying the killing of Chinese people. And those killings weren't even related to what the people did.

Just like you Suharto grouped all people of Chinese ethnicity (including those that had been there for decades and prior to the 1911 revolution) as supporters of the PRC and killed literally tens of thousands of people of Chinese ethnicity.

Then in 1998, a similar thing occurs and 2,000 people of Chinese ethnicity are killed in 2 days.

My goodness. I literally said that a danger of this contract is that the government will use Chinese resources to silence civil liberties. What I am refuting is an imaginary threat of a Chinese naval base.

&gt;And RCEP and TPP are going to be game changers in the region because they are going to give smaller nations in southeast Asia collective protection against Chinese exploitation and imperialism,

That makes no sense since China signed on and led the creation and expansion of the RCEP. Looks like you didn't do your basic research again.

It's now known that had the Yes side won, Parizeau would have issued a UDI almost immediately. At that point, whether a UDI is legal/sufficient is immaterial; what matters is whether the government and people of Quebec believe and act as if it is, and whether Ottawa will use physical force to prevent such an interpretation. No one really believed in 1995 that the federal government would use the military to prevent secession. At that point international diplomatic recognition is what counts; France and the Francosphere would have quickly recognized Quebec as a sovereign country (quite possibly the same day as any UDi), and that would be enough to persuade the rest of the world over time. Ottawa, London, and Washington would have come around eventually.

Your attitude and Chinese attitudes toward this behavior are the problem, and that is that they do not see the difference. They see no problem in ripping entire countries off like this because they see these people as beneath them. Why are Chinese in Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Indonesia? Fishing, lumber and minerals to send back to China while putting locals out of business. 

Let me tell you something -- these people are not as stupid as Chinese like to think they are. There is going to be a backlash and a recalibration in the government back toward local indigenous people. It has already largely happened in Indonesia and it is happening right now in Solomon Islands. I honestly don't think Chinese are going to get very far trying to bring troops there and unlike you, I think that that is not because Chinese don't want to but because local people are going to say enough is enough and they are going to do something about the Chinese-backed corruption in their government. The next government in the Solomons is not going to be friendly to Chinese interests.

And RCEP and TPP are going to be game changers in the region because they are going to give smaller nations in southeast Asia collective protection against Chinese exploitation and imperialism, even if they are not signing members. Chinese better enjoy the free reign they have now because when ASEAN becomes the world's fourth largest economy and investment shifts from China to them, it will change Chinese fortunes in the region and give people alternatives to being taken complete advantage of by them.
