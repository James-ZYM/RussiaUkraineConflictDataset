That would be really dumb on China's part. You never want to shock your enemy and give them time to recover. That's what Russia did the Ukarine in 2014, then Ukarine ramped up it's military spending and now is doing a much better job than would have if Russia had just waited in 2022 to invade any part of the Ukarine. 

Most of Taiwan does not think China will actually invade, if they took Kinmen, China would gain relatively little, but also shock Taiwan into massively upgrading it's military budget, and cause the West to massively funnel arms to Taiwan, along with start decoupling critical industries from China even further.",8cb4218dad23af0afe46c837fd70cb5df05b5ea7,True,False,,,,,0,1648425570,,0,{},i2djpsv,True,t3_tpodnr,False,True,t1_i2dd764,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpodnr/what_the_invasion_tells_us_about_a_potential/i2djpsv/,1648425582,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648396770.0

China can also build missiles to protect those ships, and on a larger scale than Taiwan at that.

&gt;But even doubling it would take an absolutely massive amount of resources, resources which are not unlimited.

""Absolutely massive"" doesn't mean anything specific. China's defense spending is already at $434 billion (PPP, 2021) for a mere 1.6% of GDP. China's GDP per capita is still merely 31% of Taiwan's and 28% of the U.S.'s. It has a lot of room to grow, which will allow it to further improve its capabilities.

For comparison's sake, Taiwan's 2021 defense spending amounts to $30 billion - 2.1% of GDP.

Another way to say ""larger army"" is a standing army. When Tripoli pirates were threatening American shipping, it was the Navy and its Marines that intervened in 1805. The Navy is meant to protect our commerce, the Army is for national defense. The Constitutional problem since WWII is Washington convinced itself that everything that happens on the planet deals with American economic interests. If a country votes for a socialist leader, why that threats the US market and must be stopped. In 1965, the 82nd Airborne invaded the Dominican Republic to overturn its democracy, but instituting banana republics is a Marine's job!

&gt; This is an entirely separate issue from the constitutionality of standing armies

It isn't. Congress declares war and raises an army. The President gets command of that army only so that he can carry out Congress's goals. But the office of the President has drifted from being Congress's man of action, to being a Roman Dictator, a rotating Cinncinnatus who wields government power at his whim while ignoring the Senate

&gt; A great deal of that global reach is the Navy

Look up the Combatant Command structure. The whole world is divided into Joint Commands, making the divisions between Army, Navy and Other purely administrative. Operational control doesn't differentiate between branches, which all provide forces for global service. The idea of the Army being for security and the Navy for commerce is lost, as America now considers a threat to its oil and blood to be the same

1. Yes, but keep in mind drones vary widely in size and scope, from Global Hawk types to quadcopters. There is no one single do it all anti drone platform, and Iron Dome type defenses would be vulnerable to having C&amp;C and radar platforms being targeted. Mobile AAA platforms with cannons and short range missiles may fare better due to their relative decentralization.

2. Sounds right.

3. Anti air doesn't prevent the enemy from having air superiority, and I cannot think of one situation from the beginning of aviation's use in warfare in which it has. It can serve as a tool to enact attrition on the enemy and potentially deter, but the only way to gain air superiority is with your own aircraft.

4. Sounds good in theory but would be difficult to pull off in practice.

5. Sounds good.

6. Again sounds good to have less trained people work on simpler tasks.

There are also a few assumptions you have that I think are a bit dubious. The statement that Taiwan's mountains protect it from ballistic missiles is probably not grounded in fact. Also, assuming that ATGMs and MLRS platforms near the beach will be survivable in an environment where the enemy has air superiority is also a bit dubious. Lastly, I hear the statement that China has only a few beaches to land on and that China has only a few months out of the year to conduct a landing a lot, but are there any actual studies that support that statement?",eeeec895159abfee7506329ba2fceba4ce97a85a,True,False,,,,,0,1648420170,,0,{},i2d8krd,False,t3_tpodnr,False,True,t3_tpodnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpodnr/what_the_invasion_tells_us_about_a_potential/i2d8krd/,1648420186,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648391370.0

1. Lack of depth. Ukraine has been able to have depth on order to resupply anti-tank and other weapons from the west. Also, medical and food. In any conflict, Taiwan would essentially be cut off because China has the capabilities to blockade and starve the island of essential supplies. Also, they will be able to cut the island communication from outside by destroying undersea cables and jam satellite info. Taiwan will have a tough time tracking Chinese Units without US help

Furthermore. Taiwan won’t have many places to fall back. China will be able to bombard any city or area that it can’t take and will force Taiwan to starve to death. 

2. I am not sure where you are getting that China wouldn’t be able to land forces by air. Experts have their air borne assault and paratroopers at over 28,000. Their increasing numbers of Y-20 transports help China land a number of aircraft. 

3. China has major advantages over Russian Army. Their military budget is 4 times as big. They are able to field more Systems such as jammers, amount of cruise missiles, EW, and precision guided munitions. 

3. China is a technology powerhouse. And we have seen Russian communication and situational awareness be terrible. Their basic tanks don’t even have GPS system and have had to rely on unencrypted communication. Taiwan won’t have such advantages.

Even if we limit the exercise to just one category, it's a problem: say there were a fighter that could destroy older enemy fighters before they were even aware of its presence. How do you equate the two?

That's what I meant by my original comment about ""cutting-edge."" It's wasteful and fruitless to keep churning out tanks that highly vulnerable to ATGMs, drones, and superior tanks.  Your own source re: a crude ""military PPP"" metric doesn't get into that.  I'm skeptical it distinguishes between apples and oranges, let alone apples and watermelons (e.g., comparing a short-term conscript's training and morale to a career professional's).  

I agree re: Russia not being as bad off (relative to its state pre-invasion) as some of the crazier doom-and-gloom stories out there, in part because other sanctioned regimes have muddled through for decades, like Iran, and because there is some ability to self-produce, cannibalize, or buy on the black market via China and other countries.It seems to me that you jumped on my got-rich-before-old comment, relative to other countries, but ""rich"" is subjective.

Even using your preferred metric, I wouldn't categorize any of these as ""rich"" countries.

True but that's why I said western estimates.

&gt;and had invaded with a significantly larger force.

How would you know? Since they're both likely lying about the size of their forces and exaggerating the size of their enemy's forces.

&gt;The Vietnamese had Soviet equipment, but it was in comparatively limited in quantity. An even casualty ratio in this context is actually very bad, despite the dug in defenses that the Vietnamese had built.

Disagree strongly. You have a veteran military in defensive mountainous positions versus an invading military using second rate troops with poor logistics, equipment, and training. I would expect the invaders to suffer much higher casualties here. I'm baffled you think otherwise. It's like Verdun except one side had to move forward, they should've had much higher casualties.

&gt;I agree with the course of the war mostly, but none of the main initial political objectives were accomplished. Chinese military interventions and conflicts between the end of the Chinese Civil War to the Sino-Vietnamese War all had clear political aims and limited objectives. Attacking Vietnam to ""humiliate/teach them a lesson"" is post-war justification for the lack of any tangible gains.

Except to test/reform the PLA, to further isolate the Vietnamese, and to show that the Soviets wouldn't help them. I'm not sure that it was post-war justification. That sounds like an opinion. They helped the north Vietnamese greatly against the French and Americans, so they must've felt betrayed. It may have been both to force the Vietnamese out of Cambodia as well as revenge/punishment.

&gt;The only positive for Deng as this time is that it discredited the old People's War doctrine that Mao had forced the PLA to adhere to and allowed him to clean out and forcibly retire all the old Mao-aligned generals and put his own in place, and curtailed the PLA's political influence. But that is dependent on the notion that the PLA was going to perform as poorly, which is a weird assumption to base a military invasion of and of the sources I've read, there was no prior indication of how poorly they'd perform. This is one of those post-invasion political justifications for why the primary objectives were not reached.

Hardly a weird assumption. Deng must've known he was using second rate troops with poor training and equipment, the vast majority of them without combat experience, against battle hardened Vietnamese in defensive positions. He didn't know how the PLA would perform, given the circumstances. Either they'd do badly and he'd get his reforms, or they'd do well and he could claim the glory. Maybe he expected it to go badly with enormous casualties but that he would win anyway with sheer numbers.

I agree with the person I linked on askhistorians that it was a short term Vietnamese victory and a long term Chinese victory. They couldn't force the Vietnamese out of Cambodia which was the main objective, but he did achieve other aforementioned objectives, and the war was far more destructive for the Vietnamese side (economic/infrastructure/civilian losses), and they ultimately signed accords mostly on Chinese terms such as giving China territory.",f562c2dbf624789d1fd5d7c12f3fe3057ab2b01a,True,False,,,,,0,1648417203,,0,{},i2d2hka,False,t3_too7ss,False,True,t1_i2bq4rr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/too7ss/ukraine_megathread_march_26/i2d2hka/,1648417220,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648388403.0

[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"&gt;You know what's simplistic is writing a post like yours without acknowledging that PPP is not the be-all and end-all of stats.

GDP at PPP is the single best aggregate measure of economic output currently available.

&gt;We are using different data sources. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD  
  
In USD, China at 10434.8 and Russia at 10126.7 here hence why I said China crossed over in 2020.

The two sources provide virtually identical data. Using the IMF, in 2020 China's GDP per capita at MER was $10,511.34, whereas Russia's was $10,115.35.

The problem lay in using MER instead of PPP.

&gt;Implicit in what you write is that you think PPP is the proper measure

Not implicit. Explicit. PPP **is** the proper measure.

&gt;there are arguments for using nominal as well. Many internationally traded goods cost about the same no matter where you live.

Some internationally traded goods have standardized costs, yes. But (1) not all of them and (2) imported goods amount to a relatively small share of every country's GDP. Thus in 2020 imported goods amounted to only 14.9% of Russia's GDP and 10.4% of China's. See [here](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/rus/#yearly-imports) and [here](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/chn#yearly-imports).

&gt;There is a considerable fudge factor in trying to calculate PPP, btw. E.g., China is notorious for having adulterated/cheapened food including a particularly bad incident where cheapened baby formula killed babies. So locals actually would rather pay more for foreign-made products in many cases, as they are NOT the same.

That's (1) anecdotal and (2) misses that the biggest fudge factor is MER.

To give you an example, due to the ruble's appreciation Russia's nominal GDP jumped from $1,061 billion in 2006 to $1,393 billion in 2007. Do you think Russia's **real** economic output actually grew by 31% year-on-year in 2007? Did Russian workers briefly all become [Stakhanovites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement)?

&gt;Further, since we're talking about military strength, it's a bit odd to hinge your entire argument on PPP

It's not. There have been studies on the topic, some even creating a ""[military basket of goods and services](https://voxeu.org/article/why-military-purchasing-power-parity-matters)"". Everything I've read on the topic shows that even ""civilian"" PPP figures tend to understate defense spending in countries such as China, India or Russia.

&gt;What makes a Big Mac Index work is that you have some assurance of a certain standard, but that's not true for many civilian, let alone military, products.

PPP calculations aren't based on the price of a Big Mac.

&gt;the point is that Russia is poor

""Poor"" is relative. Russia has \~2/3 of the GDP per capita of the EU collectively or, for that matter, Japan.

&gt;and about to get poorer

Correct. Given depressed Russian growth rates, the relative productivity gap should widen even further.

&gt;and its demographics suck.

Russia's demographic trends are similar to those of the West. They're getting there faster, but they'll also stabilize earlier.

&gt;Japan's demos suck too

That's an understatement. Russia's demographics cannot be compared with Japan's. Here's the [latest UN projections](https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/):

2020: Russia 146m (66% of working-age), Japan 126m (59% of working-age)

2060: Russia 133m (58% of working-age), Japan 98m (50% of working-age)

2100: Russia 126m (59% of working-age), Japan 75m (51% of working-age)

&gt;So let's not miss the bigger picture here.

The bigger picture is that Russia's invasion isn't succeeding and that sanctions will depress Russia's catch-up growth for the foreseeable future.

&gt;Michael Kofman: What initially surprised me about the invasion is that it started more as a strategic raid. The Russians clearly believed that in three days they could conduct a regime change and get Ukraine to surrender without fighting. Looking back at it, they did not seriously plan for the kind of military operation that would be required to invade the largest country in Europe and take on a country with a sizable conventional military like Ukraine.

I have said many times this is a coup gone wrong not a military operation gone wrong. I could write substantially on that, but it comes in part from Kofmans assessment. And for me this is the bullseye. 

&gt;we don’t actually know much about Russian casualties, and we know far less about Ukrainian ones, 

This is the single most important thing he says in the article. 

Take it on board. 

&gt;The Russian military probably has one more set of offensives left in it before they’re really exhausted and become combat ineffective,

They are generating forces and building for that. This again is really good and clear information. How are people seeing this as fence sitting. This is pretty direct for analysis, admitting our uncertainties then giving us the most likely scenario.

&gt;you’ll likely see a series of small, staggered attacks and counterattacks that will yield no significant changes in territory.

Personally I differ here and think there will be collapses by both due to lack of critical items. But I think this is a good analysis making clear predictions. Well not predictions giving most likely assessments. What do you want? 

&gt; You can’t predict the churn of battle, but I suspect that they have a couple more weeks left before they’re going to have to make major shifts in this operation.

He is not reading their coded instructions. This is good. In fact this is as good as you will see without making it up. 

&gt;Russian military has really struggled to focus itself on what the hell it is trying to accomplish in the war. Is it the encirclement of the capital, or is it the encirclement of Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of Ukraine and taking Donbas? Is it the march to Odesa, which is the very opposite direction from Donbas? If I only have the forces for one, I really should pick.

I would not differ other than to say Russia is using a horribly under resourced Deep Operation, Kofman is advocating a Schwerpunkt. The difference between bringing 200 000 and 2 million to the battle. 

&gt;Somebody at the top — which is only one person in Russia — is setting political objectives that continue to be unachievable, and they’ve gone from regime change to attaining other political objectives, which are also not achievable with this force based on the performance they’ve had.

Gold. Absolute gold. 

&gt;They have been bringing units in from other parts of the country. We know they’re on the way. We know that they have more units they can flow into this fight. The challenge they’re going to have is that the units they’re bringing in are *probably not going to be as effective*

Good shout. 

&gt;If they choose, they can mobilize the country behind this war and press more people into service and pass special laws that give them access to greater manpower and start using reserve equipment they have in warehouses. And if it then gets into a war of attrition between Russia and Ukraine, it’ll be a much bloodier war. It’ll be dragged out. And that’s where I’m a lot less sanguine about Ukraine’s prospects,

No great insight but its obvious to us all. But the following to this was highlighted against him. 

&gt;BMPs \[Russian armored personnel carriers\] don’t run on money. The sanctions are not going to affect the forces deployed forward right now. That’s the reality of it. As long as Putin feels that he has public support for this war,

Again compare to the widespread talk of the efficacy of sanctions. 

Its a good analysis for its audience. Politically interested but militarily illiterate. 

We are all free to take differing opinions on who we trust and do not. Kofman is there to write long reports of the status of Russian capabilities for those seeking deep level knowledge. He can throw some light on current events, but little more than any seasoned analyst, though he may bring greater knowledge to that. 

What do you want. 

Who is better. 

There is a real live war on and we may be image rich, but we are very very much information deficit. There is some good insight here despite that. 

We all have differing information sources we like. When I listen to Kofman, not so much in this interview, I hear so very insightful things given all the chaos. 

The only ""out there"" takes I take seriously are someone called Kamil Galeev. At this point of a war, unless you are getting decoded transcripts from one sides battle plans, Kofmans view is what you would expect. 

We are detail poor. All opinions have to be on a spectrum of uncertainty. Humans fighting for their lives are incredibly creative and resilient. Understanding that is why analysis of information poor events has to be so couched in uncertainty.",b8016b637fb162a4d421b80952232344a130a246,True,False,,,,,0,1648410205,,0,{},i2cn7up,False,t3_tpij9z,False,True,t1_i2ccoes,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpij9z/ukraine_megathread_march_27/i2cn7up/,1648410216,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648381405.0

In USD, China at 10434.8 and Russia at 10126.7 here hence why I said China crossed over in 2020.

Implicit in what you write is that you think PPP is the proper measure, but there are arguments for using nominal as well. Many internationally traded goods cost about the same no matter where you live.

There is a considerable fudge factor in trying to calculate PPP, btw. E.g., China is notorious for having adulterated/cheapened food including a particularly bad incident where cheapened baby formula killed babies. So locals actually would rather pay more for foreign-made products in many cases, as they are NOT the same.

Further, since we're talking about military strength, it's a bit odd to hinge your entire argument on PPP when it's not clear how much of Russia's military is foreign-made (they had to shut down tank production almost immediately after sanctions, and there are various Western components in their missiles, among other things), and when it's questionable how to equate Russian gear with Western gear.  E.g., we're seeing how incredibly deficient the design of Russian tanks are vs. much better armored Western tanks.

What makes a Big Mac Index work is that you have some assurance of a certain standard, but that's not true for many civilian, let alone military, products.

[],False,,ScipioAsina,,,[],,,,text,t2_a00n5,False,False,"I just finished reading [a somewhat lengthy interview with Michael Kofman, which Politico published earlier this week.](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/03/21/michael-kofman-russia-military-expert-00018906) There aren't many fresh insights here, I think, for those who have been closely following the news and other commentators (or even these daily CredibleDefense threads), but I did come out of it with a better grasp of Kofman's working assumptions. Two statements stood out to me in particular. First, on the relative strength of Ukrainian and Russian forces:

&gt; I can’t guess what their [i.e., the Ukrainians'] losses are, but they’re not in any better shape. So one of two things is likely to happen over the next couple of weeks: We will either see a significant operational pause and some kind of ceasefire that will lead to a settlement, or that pause will introduce a rearming period where Russia will introduce a number of units that they’re bringing up to the border right now. They have more forces, they have more materiel. Their losses are significant, but their rate of attrition as a share of the force is likely not as bad as Ukraine’s. But we don’t know. What matters is less the losses and more the losses as an actual share of the country’s military capacity. So Ukraine may be doing well, but nonetheless they’re still losing significant amounts of materiel and equipment.

That the Ukrainians are ""not in any better shape"" than the Russians seems like a reasonable assumption, but it's still an assumption, and one that I personally feel uncomfortable using as a starting point for analysis. We simply know too little about the current status of Ukrainian forces. And when it comes to morale, tactics, logistics, and leadership, the Ukrainians could very well have an edge over the Russians. And when discussing numbers, we need to factor in, too, the Ukrainian population's hostility toward the Russians and willingness to aid their own forces (e.g., by providing intelligence, tying down Russian troops through protests, simple acts of sabotage, etc.).

The other assumption here is that the Ukrainians are losing more equipment than the Russians, proportionally speaking, since the latter ""have more forces, they have more materiel."" However, this does not seem to take into account the foreign military aid that the Ukrainians have been receiving, nor the possibility that a significant portion of the Russians' reported military capacity might exist only on paper (judging from the maintenance issues that have already afflicted their forces in Ukraine). Economic sanctions, moreover, may make it increasingly difficult for the Russians to replace their losses in equipment. 

Second, concerning the Russian's objectives:

&gt; The initial operation was clearly a failure — that was self-evident a few days in — because of how they tried to put it together. They didn’t tell the troops, and didn’t prepare psychologically or materially, and as a result it was a debacle at the outset. We didn’t see an initial air campaign and we saw a very limited strike campaign. Since then, they’ve tried to put together a real military operation, the thrust of which is going for the capital as the center of gravity, trying to bypass major cities and take critical infrastructure, and try to encircle Ukrainian forces in the Donbas in the eastern part of Ukraine.

And further below:

&gt; It’s not a war about cities, anyway. The whole concept originally was clearly to avoid major cities. Go for key towns that are junctions and hubs and secure ground lines of communication and try to fight towards objectives that allow them to pick up rail links so that they can resupply by rail. That’s why the campaign in the north is so challenging, because you have to truck everything from Belarus down south to Kyiv, and that’s why the campaign in the south was a lot easier. Because once they took Mariupol and Kherson they can direct rail supplies into those cities and then use those supply depots for further operations.

I find it hard to accept that the ""whole concept originally was clearly to avoid major cities,"" given the Russians' offensives against Kharkiv, Mariupol, and Mykolaiv and their apparent interest in taking Odessa. Other things---like the deployment of the Rosgvardia and [the bringing of riot gear](https://twitter.com/michaelh992/status/1500374144130732035) (as well as, supposedly, [parade uniforms](https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1508136947449045000)) also suggest that the Russians expected to quickly occupy major cities. While Kofman might turn out to be correct when the dust finally settles, his statement here strikes me as an attempt to rationalize the Russians' rather disjointed thrusts throughout Ukraine. 

As I said in one of these threads a few days, I've been a little disappointed overall with Kofman's commentary on the conflict, since he's made various pronouncements (though less frequently as of late) and criticized others' opinions without really explaining the underlying evidence, analysis, and methodology that guides his own approach. From this interview, it appears to me that his expertise on the Russians' theoretical capabilities continues to shape his views more than any of the new evidence that has become available since the start of the invasion, which he essentially dismisses as being unrepresentative and one-sided. While I share his caution about information amid the fog of war, I still believe we make tentative assessments from it with proper contextualization. Surely, for example, the staggering numbers of abandoned and captured Russian vehicles documented on Oryx tell us *something* about Russia's ability to wage a large-scaled war (especially in light of reports about the poor state of Russian logistics, morale, and equipment maintenance)?",5acab155e0f05d3e5b50bfe1737ab023b29b794a,True,False,,,,,0,1648405746,,0,{},i2ccoes,False,t3_tpij9z,False,True,t3_tpij9z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpij9z/ukraine_megathread_march_27/i2ccoes/,1648405760,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648376946.0

Patriot, THAAD and the USAF. 

 This lists about 160 000 trucks in US service plus 170 000 Humvees and other light armored utility vehicles.

They read the intelligence differently. One story that went around the lack of a clear theatre commander and the lack of inter front comms signaled to the Ukrainians that this was not serious. 

Also they have wondered who in their right minds campaigns in Rasputitsa. 

&gt;Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, some analysts identified the logistical challenges of the mud season as a likely hindrance to any large-scale invasion in spring.\[8\] When Russia did cross the border, many of its mobile units found themselves stranded in fields and limited to major roads, where resistance and logistical issues significantly slowed the advance towards Kyiv

This is a bit simplistic. Here's GDP per capita figures for 2021:

1. Germany: $58,150
2. Italy: $45,267
3. Japan: $44,935
4. Russia: $30,431

Source is [the IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2021/October). The average for the EU is roughly Italy, thus Russia has \~2/3 of the aggregate EU's level of productivity per capita.

Russia also has far better demographics than Japan, albeit worse human capital.

&gt;In fact, China's GDP-per-person became higher than Russia's circa 2020.

That's incorrect. Again according to the IMF, figures for 2021 are:

1. Russia: $30,431
2. China: $19,090

Relative to Russia, China is currently roughly where Russia is relative to the collective EU. China is however likely to pass Russia in GDP per capita before the end of this decade.

&gt;Previous posters already commented about how Russia's GDP is roughly the same size as Italy or Spain's, despite a much larger population and vastly more natural resources.

Only at market exchange rate (MER), which is not a measure of economic output. At purchasing power parity, Russia is the sixth largest economy in the world, just behind Germany:

I've read Glantz. He never explains how he arrived at that number. It appears to be unsupported guesswork.

&gt;But I also don't think that Germany could have achieved its strategic objectives after 1943.

I agree.

&gt;Even without lend lease the German strategic reserves were running dry

That's incorrect. 1943 was in the fact the year in which the Wehrmacht peaked, manpower-wise.

&gt;their supply lines were overstretched

German supply lines were both shorter and had greater capacity in 1943 than in 1942.

&gt;the political situation in the occupied territories was becoming uncontrollable.

Not really. Apart from the Balkans and the occupied USSR, resistance movements were small and barely registered an impact. And even in the Balkans and the occupied USSR, widescale resistance had a limited negative impact on German operations.

At the end of the day, Germany's position was unsalvageable in 1943 not because of any fundamental issue with the German war effort, but because by then the Anglo-Americans had brought sufficient military power to the European theater to prevent the Germans from amassing enough strength to renew effective offensive action against the Soviets. In turn, the Soviets were too great a threat for the Germans to focus sufficient resources to forestall Anglo-American advances in the Mediterranean.

At the end of the day, WW2 is very simple: it hinged on whether or not the Soviets could survive long enough for the Anglo-Americans to bring their forces to bear.

First, casualty figures are difficult to determine given the poor quality of either official statistics. However, keep in mind that the PLA had significantly better materiel than the Vietnamese did, and held the firepower edge during this time, and had invaded with a significantly larger force. The Vietnamese had Soviet equipment, but it was in comparatively limited in quantity. An even casualty ratio in this context is actually very bad, despite the dug in defenses that the Vietnamese had built.

I agree with the course of the war mostly, but none of the main initial political objectives were accomplished. Chinese military interventions and conflicts between the end of the Chinese Civil War to the Sino-Vietnamese War all had clear political aims and limited objectives. Attacking Vietnam to ""humiliate/teach them a lesson"" is post-war justification for the lack of any tangible gains. Vietnam continued their war and occupation of Cambodia and the Vietnamese remained aligned with the Soviets through the 80s through early 90s when Sino-Soviet rapprochement was actually on the table. Certainly it ""demonstrates to Hanoi that the Soviets wouldn't start a war on their behalf"", but that had little geopolitical impact. It showed the Americans that they were anti-Soviet...maybe, but the Chinese/Deng was the one to ask the US to do this, and the Carter administration had serious discussions about the request. A Chinese invasion of Vietnam was not in any way on their minds, and was done for Chinese, not American, interests in Cambodia 

The only positive for Deng as this time is that it discredited the old People's War doctrine that Mao had forced the PLA to adhere to and allowed him to clean out and forcibly retire all the old Mao-aligned generals and put his own in place, and curtailed the PLA's political influence. But that is dependent on the notion that the PLA was going to perform as poorly, which is a weird assumption to base a military invasion of and of the sources I've read, there was no prior indication of how poorly they'd perform.

And Eastern Europe? And the Fennoscandians? How well do you know their history and politics? Do you think they would be happy to see Putin take a ""win"" from this war, knowing their histories?

I am not making a statement but inviting you to not think of this as ""Putin vs US"" but to take a long hard look and listen to the other very very interested parties. 

And remember when we talk about Eastern Europe, you are talking about a large group of Germans. Their capital was half occupied by the Soviets for 45 years.

A. Shoot, shoot, shoot.  
For any given LER weapons system, Individual Marines or even platoons don't contain enough high PK shots to be worth the logistics sustainment of each effector.  Find a force level which is (afloat or airborne = high tempo, easy resupply) and give them the ability call down the rain.

B.  Mass fires not forces.  
Because if you want to increase attrition using any give effects based model, the fewer on your side being shot by any given salvo, the better.

C.  Maneuver to target, not engage.  
Because the ISR drones can be smaller, cost less and are potentially agnostic, not requiring a specific size/type of associated formation to support.

D.  Separate your targeting from your fires.  
There is a reason why Russian cluster Tochka/Smerch/Grad rounds are coming up half a mile short of valid SA-10/11 site splash.  You have to make sure that your network security for both positioning and targeting is higher for your RISTA than for your fires assets.  Because anything which compromises the one is going to bring ruin to the other.

E.  Contempt of Engagement.  
There is absolutely no reason to be in a two sided fire fight or indeed, engagement of any kind.  Ever.  Anywhere.  It not only chews up your forces (see B) but it creates commitments which eat into your ability to strategically negate the enemy ops plan.  Because you are supporting an in-contact fight which you \_should not be\_.

ARGUMENT:  
We have something like 40,000 special forces, two DIVISION equivalents.  We have a boatload of grunts occupying the higher intensity end of the spectrum.  We have air deliverable units in the 82nd and various Ranger Battalions.

Marines are no longer special.  Because there are better CQB/UCW and APOD/SPOD takers to allow for a main force entry to the theater.

You’re right about it being a bit odd for the Marines, and the typical use case for MRLS being counter battery fire (in part because of the *greater range* that rockets provide over traditional artillery). US does emphasize guided munitions and the HIMARS can use unguided rockets, guided rockets, or a guided missile. This would allow a battery to aid Marines on another island nearby. Perhaps even strike an enemy ship! I’m not too sure how effective that would be, but even harassing fire and some damage can stave off an opponent. Like how WW2 US fighter-bombers weren’t very good at outright destroying tanks, but did force columns of German troops to move at night out of fear of attack. On top of greater success on softer targets too. 

HIMARS is a wheeled platform on a standard truck chassis, fine for rapid deployment over roads. Or over the front of a landing craft. Importantly, it is C-130 capable! It is possible to land some C-130s, fire the rockets, load back up and get back in the air relatively quickly.

Because unlike the Vietnamese, the Soviets could actually threaten China. And like you mentioned, the PLA was severely weakened by the cultural revolution, plus they were fighting battle hardened Vietnamese defending their homeland. If I was a betting man, I'd bet on the battle hardened defenders, but oddly enough both sides actually had a similar number of casualties. Though economic costs and of course civilian losses were much higher for Vietnam. This was worsened by the PLA pillaging and causing destruction on their way out.

Deng didn't plan for a long war/occupation so withdrawal was always going to happen. He saw what happened to other militaries that got stuck in Vietnam. The war lasted just under a month. Some of Deng's objectives were accomplished, some were not.

One of the observations highlighted in the book is how most soldiers in WW2, upwards of 90% at times, shot over the heads of their enemies rather than directly trying to take life. I'd recommend the book as a great read in general, but I think that's one of the most immediate ones: Soldiers aren't going to fight with the same ferocity, and be more reluctant to kill.

Especially in offenses, *élan* is one of the most important things you can foster in a unit. It's something Napoleon identified over 200 years ago. A soldier who is not motivated isn't going to take initiative to rush that trench, be the first to pipe up to clear that home, to lay down relentless fire and storm a city.

Modern militaries invest a *lot* of thought and effort into working around this issue - training drills, building esprit de corps, using a lot of stand-off long-range weaponry - but the average infantryman in combat to the present day doesn't actually kill *anyone*.


So, if you have an army whose indirect/standoff weapons are failing to do the trick, you need to rely on infantrymen advancing under fire, reducing enemy positions, and fighting effectively. Without good training and without good morale, what you get instead is a bunch of guys *pretending* to attack. 

Take a *long* time to get ready to advance, take a *long* time advancing, shoot a whole bunch of bullets in the right compass direction when you're too far away to be effective anyway, shout a lot at your mates, maybe crawl forward a bit if you think it's safe, and that's that.

So to answer the OPs question, while the PR of having so many high ranking officers is not good, and it's impossible to quantify the strategic decision making impact, it's probably ""good"" in the sense that those officers are still trying to win.",41a58df6e43592ec3f2700514968d0c447ea6a60,True,False,,,,,0,1648341322,,0,{},i29akg1,False,t3_tot8d6,False,True,t1_i297bmi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tot8d6/what_sort_of_effect_could_loosing_7_generals_and/i29akg1/,1648341340,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648312522.0

[],False,,dhippo,,,[],,,,text,t2_96jvkbuc,False,False,"It strongly depends on the force we're talking about. I'll focus on russia in my answer, it would be very different if we were talking about the US, for example.

Russias military has kept a very top-down approach to military operations. Junior officers have less autonomy to make choices as they see fit, compared to western militaries. Given the high information density in any modern large-scale combat situation, this creates a kind of leadership bottleneck for russian units. I suspect this is why the russian senior officers moved nearer to the front line in the first place: to provide more efficient leadership. Now if they get killed doing so, the leadership bottleneck becomes even narrower. Note that some senior officers seem to be killed by attacks on their command posts, so other officers from their staff might have been killed, too. 

Another important factor is russias lackluster NCO corps. Compared to western militaries, there are significantly less NCOs per enlisted men. NCOs form the backbone of every armies leadership, this are the guys making the tactical decision at the Squad-level.

Between NCOs and senior officers are the junior officers. Those are in a very bad position right now: Due to the lack of NCOs they need to become more involved into low-level tactical stuff, if a senior officer is killed they need to become more involved into higher-level leadership. They are not trained to do this, especially given the russian top-down aproach. Officer-to-men ratio in the russian military is not great, either.

So my conclusion is: In Units with killed senior officers, the junior officers will be somewhat overwhelmed between the lack of both superior and subordinate leaders. This might effectively paralyze some units and render them incapable of more then static defense operations.",7df73614c93ec81f5c469c44234cbd6427fffa61,True,False,,,,,0,1648339718,,0,{},i297bmi,False,t3_tot8d6,False,False,t3_tot8d6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tot8d6/what_sort_of_effect_could_loosing_7_generals_and/i297bmi/,1648339734,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648310918.0
