None of them are democracies, personal freedoms are very limited and the rule of law is a joke

In Russia's case - well, they've done all that you suggested - and it got them nowhere. Their education system is decent, about on par with Austria or France, as measured by PISA. Their R&amp;D is also respectable - the GDP and population is about equal to Mexico, but the scientific and engineering output isn't even in the same league. The fact they can build their own cars, airplanes or nuclear power plants shows education and organization are not bottlenecks

Reality is that climate matters, geography matters, demography matters. Russian plain is nearly fully landlocked, is the worst inhabited climate in the world, the soil is unproductive and cannot grow industrially useful flora, the inhabited parts are remarkably energy poor, distances vast, natural resources are thousands of kilometers away from where they'd be needed - in places where agriculture cannot sustain population and just building basic infrastructure requires specialized techniques due to permafrost. Due to these objective and immutable factors, Russia cannot play the economic game - transportation and energy costs make them inherently uncompetitive, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.

As far as the US invading Mexico - maybe. It depends on the global environment in this scenario and the level of Chinese presence in Mexico. And yes, I agree that the US would probably pressure Mexico so intensely that an invasion wouldn't be needed. 

I guess my point is this situation is so radically different from the global environment today that it is not a very good comparison to current situations.

&gt;Russia absolutely _was_ a great power, and has the capacity of becoming one again

I strongly disagree. Demographics are going the wrong way, illiberal policies are harming both the economy and public discourse, and the brain drain on their labor force continues to worsen. 

The early USSR had a lot to gain through industrialization because the Russian Empire had so emphatically failed at modernizing. After WWII though, they first slowly and then rapidly fell behind the West in many categories. Even in the 1980s, the USSR was only pretending to still be a superpower.

&gt;every move that the USA has made in Europe since the end of the cold war reflects that understanding.

I think that reads far too much competence into US actions. Stability of Moscow's government was the primary concern of the US throughout the 90s because they feared a breakup of Russia would result in nuclear-armed warlords. This is why they accepted both Yeltsin's and Putin's heavy-handedness against their opposition.

Following that, Russia was mostly considered not to be an issue by the US—which was busy in the Middle East—until the invasion of Georgia in 2008. You can read heavily about the Bush-era policies that enabled this. Even after the Georgia invasion, the Obama administration still attempted to reconcile with Russia before realizing that the situation was hopeless.

Yes NATO has expanded, but NATO avoided permanent troop deployments in Eastern Europe until 2014, has only since the Ukraine war decided to build permanent bases there, and has placed no nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe. The West has sought to belay Russian paranoia by not placing weapons and troops on their borders, but also assuring smaller nations of their security by inviting them into NATO.

This strategy has failed to appease Russia, but all of the current members of NATO are quite happy with their position right now.

This right here. I find it unlikely that they will 'truly' attempt to revert the incoming demographic collapse until it's already too late. They will undoubtably play cheesy commercial propaganda that encourage population growth like Singapore does. And just like Singapore it will likely have almost no effect at all. They just don't have the will to do anything serious until they absolutely have to.

Because taking this seriously would mean admitting that there is in fact an oncoming demographic collapse. And admitting that there's an oncoming demographic collapse is admitting that the one child policy was a colossal blunder caused by the Communist Party. So essentially if the Chinese leadership take actual serious actions to reverse the demographic crisis then they would end up considerably discrediting themselves.
