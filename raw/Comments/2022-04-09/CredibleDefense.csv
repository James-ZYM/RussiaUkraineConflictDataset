Because you only count Russian forces on the frontlines while you count all Ukrainian armed forces. All the Ukrainian units and TDF troops in Western Ukraine or Odesa are not really participating in any way. Meanwhile Russian troops in Ukraine are Russian troops on frontlines, pretty much all of them. Rosgvardia and its death squads handles occupation.

As the Holstomel airfield appeared to have a been a pivotal objective for the Russian forces to not only secure territory on the flank of Kyiv but allow the rapid resupply and insertion of troops, the inability to hold that ground rapidly altered Russian plans and caused a change in strategy the Ukrainian forces could exploit and stall the entire front.

In the south however, the Dnieper river flowing thru the country runs the risk of trapping friendly forces on the wrong side of the river if the attack can not be blunted. It is reasonable to assume that Russian forces staged in Crimea and Donetsk could sweep to Kherson and Dnipro faster than forces could pull back if they can not hold the line, this would cut off a very large percentage of the available forces. As an attack on Odesa was anticipated the Ukrainians trying to hold the southern side of the river could find a huge amount cut off, any reserves flanked on either side and exposed to air support from Crimea, and barrage from the Black Sea. As Kherson and Dnipro are natural choke points, a resistance in depth approach stalls an attack and grants a land bridge to Russian territory but now they have to protect a significantly larger front and for the Russian forces there any counter attacks on Kherson, or Melitopol  lead to being cut off and rapidly encircled. With the attack collapsing in the north and Ukrainian forces moving south i would expect every commander in the southern regions to be highly concerned about their positions abilities to hold direct counter attacks when it is clear the Ukrainians are highly organized and motivated, while Russian forces morale continues to erode as ""an easy, quick victory"" stretches into its second month.",9bc430c84e6ab4f8c7c38c651cd890b91883fcfc,True,False,,,,,0,1649547055,,0,{},i43ifdr,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,False,t1_i41q8jl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i43ifdr/,1649547068,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649518255.0,

[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"I am confused by the following excerpt of the ISW report: ""Russian forces have performed so poorly in this war despite their **large numerical advantage**.""

When I run the numbers, however, I don't see how Russia can have a significant numerical advantage, save perhaps for the first days / week of the conflict.

Thus, at the start of the campaign Russia had \~190,000 ground personnel available, of which a part were the paramilitary Rosgvardia and another part the DPR/LPR separatists. The best estimate I've seen is that Russian military ground forces proper numbered \~150,000 men.

Here is the IISS breakdown for Ukrainian ground forces:

1. Ground Forces: 125,600
2. Air Assault Troops: 20,000
3. Naval Infantry: 6,000
4. Special Operations Forces: 1,000

For a total of 152,600 active regulars.

To them must be added paramilitary formations:

1. National Guard: 60,000
2. Border Guard: 42,000

For a total of 102,000 irregulars, which combined to the aforementioned regular forces gives us a total of 254,600 men available prior to general mobilization. Some of those men, of course, are in HQ / rear / training units, and constitute a somewhat wider category than the \~190,000 Russian troops, but even generous (for Russia) assumptions would indicate that Ukrainian manpower pre-mobilization was at least equal, and probably somewhat larger, than the Russian invasion force.

Presumably, at the beginning of the war some of those units would have covered rear areas (i.e., Western Ukraine), but by now they should almost all be engaged, which is indeed what [OSINT indicates](https://twitter.com/JominiW/status/1511571783576694786/photo/1).

Now let's look at Ukrainian reserves. We have:

1. Operational reserve of the Ground Forces: [50,000](https://www.ukrmilitary.com/2016/05/zminy-vijskovyi-rezerv.html) with yearly refresher training
2. Territorial Defense Forces: 130,000 (of which [110,000 confirmed mobilized](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/04/08/do-lav-teroborony-vstupyly-110-tys-ukrayincziv-bilshe-100-vzhe-mayut-derzhavni-nagorody-brygadnyj-general-yurij-galushkin/) as of April 8th)

Altogether, active regulars, reservists and paramilitaries amount to 434,600 men - say, **\~400,000** if we deduct ""overhead"".

My question: How can it be said that Russia has a ""large numerical advantage"" in those circumstances?",cde3f16c305bb5a6aac3d59653ae5e99d06a5e2f,True,False,,,,,0,1649544339,,0,{},i43cisz,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,True,t1_i435ese,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i43cisz/,1649544355,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649515539.0,

Russia is unlikely to be able to mass combat power for the fight in eastern Ukraine proportionate to the number of troops and battalion tactical groups it sends there.

The Russian military continues to suffer from devastating morale, recruitment, and retention problems that seriously undermine its ability to fight effectively.

The outcome of forthcoming Russian operations in eastern Ukraine remains very much in question.”

However, I don’t think things are necessarily so straightforward.

For one, although the population was Russian speaking, this does not mean that everyone living there identified as an ethnic Russian. There seems to have originally been a 50/50 split between Ukrainians and Russians. Polls I have read (I'm not sure how reliable they are) do not indicate that most people wanted to secede, and wanted federalisation at most. 

Secondly, the protests started only very shortly after Yanukovych was deposed, there was no government to blame at the time. They largely seemed to have erupted from ethnic tensions, and the Crimean annexation. 

Thirdly, the wars have probably changed things considerably, including the expulsion of many pro-Kyiv people, and the economic downturn. 

Finally, the areas have largely become militarised mafia states from what I understand, which Russia has propped up.

Would they still be blaming Ukraine for all this? Quite possibly, Russian media may have still turned them against Ukraine, as well as the experience of the war.

&gt; Over the years, Zaluzhnyy made no secret of his push for greater financing and other public support for the military. But during the war, his main request of political leaders has been to stay out of the way and let the soldiers do their work — and especially not to raise public doubts about the course of the war.

That, to me, speaks volumes to how the Ukrainian government is setup and to how the military has been making such great successes. Zelenskyy has been delegating the military fighting to Zaluzhnyy, because Zalhuzhnyy can make the hard decisions. That frees up Zelenskyy to do the things that he can do best, raise awareness on the international stage and get international political support. Zaluzhnyy can focus on battlefield victories and making the hard calls.

An example of this is Ukraine is letting Mariupol fall while they are taking Kherson. Mariupol is probably surrounded with a lot of really good Russian forces - and getting Mariupol back right now would incur more losses to Ukraine than Russia. Kherson is at the end of a long Russian supply line and is of extreme strategic importance to controlling Southern Ukraine, even though it isn't a politically motivated target.

It is these types of calls that soldiers and generals are better at making than politicians. It's cold, it sucks, and it means the barbarism in Mariupol will continue. But that gives Ukraine the option to liberate Kherson sooner. And getting Kherson back soon will be a way to flank Russia's southern forces and cut off the land bridge between Crimea and Donbass.",6d9455147c3a350aff939f057bfe8e8fd9818248,True,False,,,,,0,1649528955,,0,{},i42d3yu,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,True,t1_i41k5vg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i42d3yu/,1649528967,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649500155.0,

[],False,,Doglatine,,,[],,,,text,t2_a8hrp,False,False,"It's been widely observed that US has consistently underinvested in SPAAGs, long-range static AA, and artillery compared to the Russians (see, e.g., this piece on [artillery](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/terrifying-russian-artillery-outguns-united-states-187309), this discussion on [SAMs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/3dn68n/why_doesnt_the_united_states_have_a_better_sam/)). The simple answer to this is that the West and particularly the US always make air superiority an overriding mission goal, with lots of training and investment going into things like [SEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_Enemy_Air_Defenses). And once you've got air superiority, you don't need SAMs, and the value of massed artillery isn't huge compared to constant Close Air Support.

I can see why this makes sense for near-peer conflicts, but as we've seen in Syria and Ukraine, there are likely to be situations where the US cannot commit air assets directly for political reasons, and has to rely on transfers of weapons, ideally relatively low-tech/asymmetrical ones. Javelins and Stingers have been star performers in this regard, but it's unfortunate that the US didn't, e.g., have Buk equivalents (which have approximately three times the range of a Stinger system) or basic artillery/armour that could be transferred without serious worries about loss of sensitive technology.

Since MAD still applies and proxy wars are likely to persist well into this century, I wonder if this is something future administrations might try to rectify, with a dedicated subset of the budget earmarked for developing and constructing weapons for 'allied support' - lower-tech weapons assets, designed for insurgent forces or asymmetrical conflicts, that are ready to ship out at a moment's notice.",7e7bf040e44f43b1fd153fa746c706228b84fe2e,True,False,,,,,0,1649521166,,0,{},i41ttzi,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,True,t3_tzrr3h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i41ttzi/,1649521181,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649492366.0,

I get that, but I can't reconcile it with the fact that UA govt. seems so wrong-footed by the war. Airforce and SF seem to be ready but the army wasn't even mobilised when RU tanks started rolling into Kherson. I've read somewhere that part of the reason could be Zelenskyy was trying to not give a reason for RU to invade, but that doesn't answer how they couldn't have mobilised some units in secret or mobilised in the west and called it an exercise. 

Basically, I'm surprised how the Ukrainians are both ready enough to masterfully hold off the Kiev axis, but also shocked enough to completely fail on the south bank of the Dneiper.

&gt;""bruised but still incredibly functional"" is a possible answer alongside ""secretly concealing that they are 2 days from total collapse,"" which is somehow always the implied answer here

I can't speak for the rest of the users, but for me it's a simple matter of ""you expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised"". There's also an element that RU forces are still the one with the initiative especially in the Donbass, despite UKR victories. UKR is mostly on the reactive in the east.

&gt;The UA is surely taking loses, but is there really so much fog of war that we can't definitively say that the UA is doing fine

The point that UKR has meagre resources is fact, so any few losses they take is a huge blow, especially when it comes to air assets. Like, 1 pilot death is 5% of your frontline combat ready aviation gone. That's what I meant by my last sentence, not that UKR is definitely not doing fine.

&gt;It is entirely possible, even likely, that the UA is in good shape, has taken less losses than Russia, and with adequate resupply from the West could very well be better set up for a war of attrition.

Yes, but the west needs to be supplying heavier weapons than handheld or old MRAP's they don't need anymore.",a00819a564c65bea7c79011ed42889843787aafa,True,False,,,,,0,1649519717,,0,{},i41q8jl,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,True,t1_i41h4cy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i41q8jl/,1649519731,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649490917.0,

https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/08/ukraines-iron-general-zaluzhnyy-00023901

---------------

&gt; In many ways Zaluzhnyy epitomizes a new generation of Ukrainian officers who cut their teeth in the grinding eight-year war in Donbas and, when not on the front, deployed to training ranges across Europe to drill with NATO forces — experiences that have sanded off many of the authoritarian edges produced by decades of rigid Soviet military training.

&gt; That collaboration with NATO has molded a group of professional-minded officers that aspired to Western standards and helped build a decentralized, empowered, more agile way of warfare than the Russian model, which has floundered in the Ukrainian mud.

----------------

That training and battlefield experience against the Russians and their separatist proxies in Donbas allowed commanders of small, dispersed units to think for themselves, overturning the old Soviet model of top-down leadership that has paralyzed Russian units and forced top generals to venture to the front lines, where several have been killed.

-----------------

&gt; ...adding that flexibility has been a game-changer so far against a Russian onslaught that has fielded “a larger, more capable force — who is all about its rigid plan.”

-------------------

&gt; That combat and the hands-on training by NATO in western Ukraine spawned a new generation of small-unit leaders and noncommissioned officers who can think and act independently. The changes weren’t immediate, but the hard-won knowledge from regular skirmishes quickened a “cultural change at the battalion level on down,” Collins said. “An entire generation understood how to lead, and I think the generals understood that it worked.”

A huge reason why (1) UKR Airforce never stopped flying, (2) the raid at Hosomel failed, (3) Russia was forced to dispatch an emergency convoy to resupply their main attack, which got bogged down by mud and UA SOF.

A good reminder here that, whenever people wildly speculate about the state of the UA, ""bruised but still incredibly functional"" is a possible answer alongside ""secretly concealing that they are 2 days from total collapse,"" which is somehow always the implied answer here.

The UA is clearly the better trained and more disciplined force. They have interior supply lines, real rail connections, and a friendly local population wherever they go. They have higher morale and, unless Russia actually mobilizes, a manpower advantage. 

The UA is surely taking loses, but is there really so much fog of war that we can't definitively say that the UA is doing fine?

The Russian empire never sought a ""buffer zone"" and neither did the USSR before WWII. And the Soviet ""buffer zone"" was not a true buffer at all. You had Yugoslavia, Finland and Austria as neutral states of course but there were hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops in East Germany. The independent Warsaw Pact member states acted as a Soviet-dominated league (or coalition, if you will) against the capitalist world. The fact such a league was established instead of the Soviet Union just annexing these countries was the result of various historical conditions, most importantly the fact it was a bit too much to swallow for a state ravaged by years of total war.

The ""geopolitical"" reasoning of Russia needing ""buffer zones"" for its existential security is simply a red herring and a point of propaganda. The talk about Russia fearing NATO tank columns streaming out of Poland is simply absurd because of nuclear deterrence. If Russia really cared about what it says (also about ""flight times"" of nuclear rockets from NATO territory to Moscow), it would not have withdrawn from Chernihiv, which is as close to Moscow as it gets. This war is being fought not to make Russia more secure, but because a single man perceives himself to be compelled by historical forces to right an obscene wrong of Ukraine not being under Russian control.

&gt;but if the rumours of Russia planning to fabricate referendums in DPR/LPR to join Russia is to be trusted, isn't it counter-productive to this goal?

Still, it is quite probable that DNR/LNR will hold a referendum to join Russia at some point. For now the framing is too convenient of us, Russians, helping our brothers in Donbass to fight a liberation war. This framing of us helping the underdog disappears when these territories become Russia. If Russia manages to get control of Donetsk and Lugansk administrative regions, as the republics' constitutions demand, I'd expect a referendum.

1. Ukraine has been mobilizing since the start of the war, with the claimed 900k reservist and the formation of local TDFs being the focus on this front, I haven't heard much about the other aspect of Ukraine's society being mobilized towards a total war. Any information or news article on this?
2. Have any simplified/emergency production version of standard/quasi-standard equipments (i.e the likes of PPS-43 or PZ4J) being spotted, or if not how likely will they be relevant in this war?
3. Railway was always the backbone for war on the European continent, and the railway department can only complain about now having enough trains, but it seems that the railways had played a less important role in the current war, the Ukrainian Railways even still running scheduled evacuation trains. Can someone explain the relevance of the railways in the current war?
4. The importance of the Antonovskiy bridge at Kherson had be stressed repeatedly, and I understand it's effect of the situation on Southern Ukraine, however I also watched a few video showing that with modern technology and construction equipments, prefab highway-grade bridges can be built within weeks if not days, can someone share some opinions on this aspect?
5. It was being said that Russia, than Soviet Union, and now Russia again was always seeking for a buffer zone towards other major powers on it's west, but if the rumours of Russia planning to fabricate referendums in DPR/LPR to join Russia is to be trusted, isn't it counter-productive to this goal? And further more is there a consensus among Russians on where is the boundary of ""Metropolitan-Russia""?
6. How will Russia react to a ""Destroyers-for-Bases"" type of land-lease agreement bewteen US and Ukraine, both in short-term and long-term?

First paragraph:

&gt; In the weeks prior to the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Marine Corps University hosted a four-day wargame to forecast the war’s course. That wargame proved remarkably prescient, accurately predicting almost all of Russia’s major combat movements in the first week of operations. As the war entered its second month, the Marine Corps War College and the Brute Krulak Center for Innovation and Future Warfare reopened the wargame with the aim of exploring how the future fight might develop, with a particular emphasis on a national resistance scenario in a Russian-occupied Ukraine.",5a5f9257d2ae5d35a199ddb2d3fdc4a7d3583f03,True,False,,,,,0,1649480999,,0,{},i3zzc08,True,t3_tzlz5p,False,True,t3_tzlz5p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzlz5p/wargaming_a_long_war_ukraine_fights_on_the_game/i3zzc08/,1649481012,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649452199.0,

The forest is the highest deposition area from the reactor fire, so literally tiny flecks of the reactor fell on it for days, with radiation high enough to immediately kill the trees. Think days of the famous firefighter suits, and that's what was buried there. 2-3 meters under the surface. Just the right depth for trenches and bunkers.

Backed by U.S. maritime companies and labor, the sponsors presented their “American Offshore Worker Fairness Act” as a measure to hold energy companies and their contractors closer to the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 – also known as the Jones Act, originally built to protect the domestic U.S. maritime industrial base.

“This bipartisan bill closes an egregious Jones Act loophole so that foreign-flagged vessels are held to the same high standards as US-flagged vessels developing our nation’s offshore energy resources, including for offshore wind projects,” Garamendi said March 2 when the amendment was accepted.

In its campaign for the legislation, the Offshore Marine Services Association stressed it would “change the current practice where foreign vessels utilize crewmembers from low-wage countries at day rates no American would or should accept. This unfair practice gives foreign vessels a competitive advantage over U.S. vessels and takes jobs away from American mariners.”

Offshore wind advocates are pushing back hard – and stressing the worldwide shortage of wind turbine installation vessels, which they say could hobble development of the U.S. wind industry for years to come.",f5b27774f5d2c464fda806219412e5bf7249f6e7,True,False,,,,,0,1649474118,,0,{},i3znbuo,False,t3_tzedlv,False,True,t1_i3zhskc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzedlv/in_the_shadow_of_warships_how_foreign_companies/i3znbuo/,1649474128,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649445318.0,

Hope for progress dimmed after Russia’s foreign minister said the Ukrainian side had proposed a new draft deal that deviated from previous versions. Belarus further complicated the situation by demanding to be included in the negotiations.

Until the Russian invasion, the main threat posed by this contamination was its absorption into mosses and trees that can burn in wildfires, disseminating the poisons in smoke, or through birds that eat radioactive, ground-dwelling insects.

“We told them, ‘This is the zone, you cannot go to certain places,’” Ms. Siloshenko said the workers had told the Russians. “They ignored us.”

At one dug-in position, Russian troops had burrowed a bunker from the sandy side of a road embankment and left heaps of trash — food wrappings, discarded boots, a blackened cooking pot — suggesting they had lived in the underground space for an extended time.

Nearby, a bulldozer had scraped away the topsoil to build berms for artillery emplacements and a half-dozen foxholes.

The forest around had recently burned, suggesting a fire had swept over the area during the Russian occupation, adding radioactive smoke to the exposure of the Russian soldiers, along with dust from disturbed ground.

The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, issued a statement Thursday saying the agency had been unable to confirm reports of Russian soldiers sickened by radiation in the zone or to make an independent assessment of the radiation levels at the site. The agency’s automated radiation sensors in Chernobyl have been inoperable for more than a month, he said.

The Ukrainian government’s radiation monitors ceased working the first day of the war, said Kateryna Pavlova, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Chernobyl Zone Management Agency. Readings from satellites, she said, showed slightly elevated radiation in some areas after the Russian occupation.

Armored vehicles that run on treads, rather than wheels, pose the primary risk for radiation safety in a wider area, as they churn up the radioactive soil and spread it into areas of Belarus and Russia as they retreat, Ms. Pavlova said. “The next person who comes along can be contaminated,” she said.

While the five-day cutoff in electricity did not lead to any disasters, it was still cause for enormous anxiety among the plant’s operators, said Sergei Makluk, a shift supervisor interviewed at the nuclear station on Thursday evening.

The backup generators that kicked in require about 18,000 gallons of diesel fuel a day. In the first days, Russian officers assured plant employees that they would have enough fuel, drawn from the supplies being trucked in for armored vehicles in the fighting in the Kyiv suburbs, Mr. Makluk said. But by the fifth day, with the military’s well-documented logistical problems, the officers said they would no longer supply the diesel.

“They said, ‘There’s not enough fuel for the front,’” and that a power cable leading to Belarus should be used to draw electricity from the Belarusian grid to cool the waste pool instead.

Mr. Simyonov, the chief safety engineer, characterized the threat to halt diesel supplies for generators as “blackmail” to force the authorities in Belarus to resolve the problem. However it happened, the electricity was restored in time and the nuclear fuel never came close to overheating.

All in all, the trench digging and other dubious activities posed a far lower risk than the waste pool, and most of that to the Russian soldiers themselves, Mr. Simyonov said, adding wryly: “We invite them back to dig more trenches here, if they want.”",d0da8ea3b09bfe510b2daccd93c5426174c68056,True,False,,,,,0,1649473577,,0,{},i3zma1f,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t1_i3zm99t,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i3zma1f/,1649473591,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649444777.0,

--------------

CHERNOBYL, Ukraine — As the staging ground for an assault on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, one of the most toxic places on earth, was probably not the best choice. But that did not seem to bother the Russian generals who took over the site in the early stages of the war.

“We told them not to do it, that it was dangerous, but they ignored us,” Valeriy Simyonov, the chief safety engineer for the Chernobyl nuclear site, said in an interview.

Apparently undeterred by safety concerns, the Russian forces tramped about the grounds with bulldozers and tanks, digging trenches and bunkers — and exposing themselves to potentially harmful doses of radiation lingering beneath the surface.

In a visit to the recently liberated nuclear station, site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, wind blew swirls of dust along the roads, and scenes of disregard for safety were everywhere, though Ukrainian nuclear officials say no major radiation leak was triggered by Russia’s monthlong military occupation.

At just one site of extensive trenching a few hundred yards outside the town of Chernobyl, the Russian army had dug an elaborate maze of sunken walkways and bunkers. An abandoned armored personnel carrier sat nearby.

The soldiers had apparently camped out for weeks in the radioactive forest. While international nuclear safety experts say they have not confirmed any cases of radiation sickness among the soldiers, the cancers and other potential health problems associated with radiation exposure might not develop until decades later.

Mr. Simyonov said that the Russian military had deployed officers from a nuclear, biological and chemical unit, as well as experts from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear power company, who consulted with the Ukrainian scientists.

But the Russian nuclear experts seemed to hold little sway over the army commanders, he said. The military men seemed more preoccupied with planning the assault on Kyiv and, after that failed, using Chernobyl as an escape route to Belarus for their badly mauled troops.

“They came and did whatever they wanted” in the zone around the station, Mr. Simyonov said. Despite efforts by him and other Ukrainian nuclear engineers and technicians who remained at the site through the occupation, working round-the-clock and unable to leave except for one shift change in late March, the entrenching continued.

The earthworks were not the only instance of recklessness in the treatment of a site so toxic it still holds the potential to spread radiation well beyond Ukraine’s borders.

In a particularly ill-advised action, a Russian soldier from a chemical, biological and nuclear protection unit picked up a source of cobalt-60 at one waste storage site with his bare hands, exposing himself to so much radiation in a few seconds that it went off the scales of a Geiger counter, Mr. Simyonov said. It was not clear what happened to the man, he said.

The most concerning moment, Mr. Simyonov said, came in mid-March, when electrical power was cut to a cooling pool that stores spent nuclear fuel rods that contain many times more radioactive material than was dispersed in the 1986 catastrophe. That raised the concern among Ukrainians of a fire if the water cooling the fuel rods boiled away, exposing them to the air, though that prospect was quickly dismissed by experts. “They’re emphasizing the worst-case scenarios, which are possible but not necessarily plausible,” said Edwin Lyman, a reactor expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The greater risk in a prolonged electricity shut off, experts say, was that hydrogen generated by the spent fuel could accumulate and explode. Bruno Chareyron, laboratory director at CRIIRAD, a French group that monitors radiation risks, cited a 2008 study of the Chernobyl site suggesting this could happen within about 15 days.

Eventually, however, electricity was restored to the plant, allaying any fears.

“We told them not to do it, that it was dangerous, but they ignored us,” said Valeriy Simyonov, left, the chief safety engineer at the Chernobyl nuclear site.

The march to Kyiv on the western bank of the Dnipro River began and ended in Chernobyl for the 31st and 36th Combined Arms Armies of the Russian military, which traveled with an auxiliary of special forces and ethnic Chechen combatants.

The formation surged into Ukraine on Feb. 24, fought for most of a month in the suburbs of Kyiv and then retreated, leaving in its wake incinerated armored vehicles, its own war dead, widespread destruction and evidence of human rights abuses, including hundreds of civilian bodies on the streets in the town of Bucha.

As they retreated from Chernobyl, Russian troops blew up a bridge in the exclusion zone and planted a dense maze of anti-personnel mines, trip wires and booby traps around the defunct station. Two Ukrainian soldiers have stepped on mines in the past week, according to the Ukrainian government agency that manages the site.

In a bizarre final sign of the unit’s misadventures, Ukrainian soldiers found discarded appliances and electronic goods on roads in the Chernobyl zone. These were apparently looted from towns deeper inside Ukraine and cast off for unclear reasons in the final retreat. Reporters found one washing machine on a road shoulder just outside the town of Chernobyl.

The Russians had come in seemingly endless columns on the first day of the war, said Natasha Siloshenko, 45, a cook at a cafeteria serving nuclear workers. She had watched, warily, from a side street.


“There was a sea of vehicles,” she said. “They came in waves through the zone, driving fast toward Kyiv.”

There was little or no combat in the zone, so far as she could tell. The armored columns merely passed through.

The Russian military used Chernobyl as a staging ground for its assault on the town of Bucha, where it suffered a defeat, but not before inflicting mayhem that Ukraine is calling “genocide.”

During the occupation, Russian soldiers searched the apartments of nuclear technicians and engineers, firefighters and support staff in the town of Chernobyl. “They took valuable items” from apartments, she said, but there was little violence.

Workers tried to caution the Russians about radiation risks, to little avail.

The background radiation in most of the 18-mile Exclusion Zone around the nuclear plant, after 36 years, poses scant risks and is about equivalent to a high-altitude airplane flight. But in invisible hot spots, some covering an acre or two, some just a few square yards, radiation can soar to thousands of times normal ambient levels.

A soldier in such a spot would be exposed every hour to what experts consider a safe limit for an entire year, said Mr. Chareyron, the nuclear expert. The most dangerous isotopes in the soil are Cesium 137, Strontium 90 and various isotopes of plutonium. Days or weeks spent in these areas bring a high risk of causing cancer, he said.

Throughout the zone, radioactive particles have settled into the soil to a depth of a few inches to a foot. They pose little threat if left underground, where their half-lives would tick by mostly harmlessly for decades or hundreds of years.

Missile attack. A missile strike at a crowded train station in eastern Ukraine killed at least 50 and wounded nearly 100, according to Ukrainian officials, who blamed Russia for hitting a major evacuation point for those trying to flee before an expected stepped-up offensive.

New efforts to isolate Russia. Russia is facing new punishing measures in response to mounting evidence of atrocities in the suburbs of Kyiv. The European Union approved a ban on Russian coal, while the United Nations suspended Russia from the Human Rights Council. The U.S. Senate voted to strip the country of its preferential trade status with the United States.

&gt;If not, how is that more important than weapons that can be used the day after they arrive?

It's not one or the other

&gt;These can only come in by train \[...\] What items will not be shipped because you have a hundred miles of train bringing in a bunch of tanks? How will the Russians miss the most obvious target of all time?

Or [truck](https://www.soframe.com/sfrmuploads/2016/06/soframe-smc-01.jpg).

&gt;Finally, the Israel in 1973 is in no way comparable to Ukraine in 2022 nor its relations to the West so I won't even deign to tackle that bit.

You haven't actually refuted anything I've said.  You just keep dodging around the topic.

Outside of that, this war is hard to predict. Russia has utterly blindsided people with their incompetence, and it's unknown how fixable the Russian army's problems are or what the timeframe of fixing them is. It's also unknown how good the Ukrainian army can be, how much NATO will arm them is unsure, and how well they'll take to the new equipment.

This war could be over in 3 days or 3 years. The short term is terrible for Russia, so NATO seems to be currently focused on making sure the long term is even worse by stepping up arming the Ukrainians.

The *best* possible case for Russia is that they manage to get their military in order, train up a bunch of reserves, and properly invade. They won't manage to get Kyiv or the west of the country, but they could *possibly* turn it around to get the east of the country and hold onto it long enough that Ukraine starts running low on manpower. Do I think that's likely? *No.* Russia's current record on this invasion is atrocious, and they would need to redo everything with less resources. Beyond that, it would still be bad, cause East Ukraine would turn into some North Korea esque military state living in total poverty and Russia's economy would hit a recession that would take a decade to recover from.

The *best* possible case for Ukraine is that NATO goes big on giving them Tanks, Jets, Artillery, and all the minor equipment and train them to use it all well. Meanwhile, Russia does not manage to get their shit in order. Then, later on, don't know when, Ukraine stages a counteroffensive and pushes out Russia. A lot of people say that Ukraine retaking Donbas and Crimea are impossible, I would change that to say it's impossible in *this* situation. The situation is changing a lot fast, if the war goes on for a while, that could become possible. Beyond that, it formally retakes Crimea and Donbas in the peace, and promptly joins NATO and becomes an EU candidate, next five to ten years have a lot of rebuilding and funding, NATO militaries move into Ukraine, and Russia's economy collapses and takes ten years to recover.

So what's likely? Nobody knows. All the smart predictions leading up to this war have been wrong in all directions. A lot of people were saying that the experts were saying that Russia would win in a few days. They actually weren't saying that, but they were saying that Russia would occupy it and get stuck in a nonstop war there for ten years until they leave. Nobody expected that they flat out *couldn't* take Kyiv. Current expert predictions are all over the place now cause they weren't ready for this.

Ukraine has plenty of motivated people willing to fight, Russia would strongly prefer not to do a full mobilization and instead goes for half measures. Full mobilization with, say, Chinese Lend Lease as a token of 'eternal friendship' and things would be looking a bit different (perhaps not very likely for a number of reasons but today's China is ruled by ideologues, not pragmatists, so I wouldn't entirely rule this option out).

Ukraine has less resources but if the West is serious enough about properly arming them instead of letting the war drag on to the point of UA army's attritioning, perhaps we'll see Ukraine at least regaining most of the land that they lost since February 24th. I'd rather not be too optimistic since it's Ukraine that sees more damage to its economy and infrastructure every day, and without an economy they'll be even more reliant on foreign countries' support, and not just to keep their military going, but to keep the entire country from collapsing. ZNPP alone which provides 25% of the country's electricity is now under Russia's control, failing to regain control of this plant alone could be very costly. It doesn't matter if Russia is unwilling to deploy enough troops to control large swathes of land when most people leave for the EU because who wants to live without electricity in the 21st century?

Historically Russia was often able to recover and learn from their initially grave mistakes even if at a huge cost, are they going to be willing and able to do that today or have they regressed to the point of not return? 

For Ukraine the longer this war lasts, the harder it is going to rebuild. Keep in mind that two months ago Ukraine was competing with Moldova and the Caucasus for the place of the poorest country in Europe. A semi-frozen conflict will not inspire foreign investors' confidence, and many among those who left will also be unwilling to return, so ideally Ukraine manages to defeat Russia, settles on the borders and has other foreign powers agree to be their guarantors of security with the guarantees stronger than the ones from 1994.

If Russia is magically gifted an army that can bring all of Ukraine under their control, the insurgency they'd face would be so well armed that I'm not sure there's a good historical model. The destruction to infrastructure and industry leads to sky high youth unemployment and there isn't really a lot of work for many Ukrainian youth outside of working with the insurgency. I'm thinking back to the UK's reaction to hearing the pIRA managed to buy a single digit number of MANPADS from Libya. It'd be nearly impossible for a puppet government to move around the country safely. Any convoy they were in would be under threat of ATGMs and any aircraft would be at extreme risk of getting hit by MANPADS during takeoff and landing. Maybe one single trip could be done safely, but over time the risk would add up to something unworkable, and that's without considering how many spies a Ukrainian insurgency would have within the puppet government. Russia is bled white and forced to withdraw after the population loses interest in the conflict, possibly claiming the ""denazification"" mission was complete. The economic consequences for Russia are devastating.

Russia is able to encircle and defeat large numbers of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, and bring Ukraine to the negotiating table. Ukrainian public opinion would make concessions very hard to accept, but if the Ukrainian government does accept those conditions, it wouldn't stop irregular Ukrainian forces from fighting, and there's every reason to believe that Ukrainian military hardware would go missing and end up with insurgent forces, whether that's actual Ukrainian policy or individual soldiers making off with them. Russian forces and puppet officials wouldn't see the war really stop for them, but Ukraine would get a chance to rearm and rebuild while sanctions against Russia were still in effect. In all likelihood you'd see Ukrainian forces carrying out attacks and sabotage within Russian borders. Outcome is identical to the first scenario, except Ukraine is given Marshal-plan levels of economic support, bringing them closer to the EU and NATO, and giving them excellent chances of victory should Russia attempt to reescalate.

No matter how this shakes out, I expect NATO to focus on building a new program in the vein of the original intent of the Partnership for Peace program, focused on creating a partial member status in a global NATO-aligned periphery. Instead of article 5, members in this group would get broad training on NATO weapon systems and explicit guarantees of weapon shipments in the event they're invaded by a clearly defined subset of their neighbors. Ukraine didn't actually need large fleets of F-16s that they'd need to maintain when Russia invaded, what they needed was large numbers of F-16 pilots and maintenance crews, enough airframes to keep them current along with assurances that F-16s would be dumped into the country should Russia invade. That same logic applies to a lot of other weapon systems.",c6765d5e069c96fe72e32aa2be38ab298813f708,True,False,,,,,0,1649463886,,0,{},i3z28gz,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t1_i3yuyxb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i3z28gz/,1649463899,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649435086.0,

[],False,,YossarianLivesMatter,,,[],,,,text,t2_10jkeo,False,False,"I believe Russia will push as far as they can go. Ukraine will want to push to regain as much territory as they can. Russia has apparently abandoned its attempt to seize the whole country, but Ukraine hasn't conceded its occupied territories. 


So, I predict a somewhat more drawn out affair now. This likely favors Ukraine, as they are effectively on total war footing while receiving large amounts of foreign aid. Russia on the other hand, has a shocked economy, appears to have fuck all for military production, and is only hesitantly mobilizing. 


So far Ukraine has benefited heavily from their defensive posture. They've played the game very well, between raids on exposed forces and defense of urban centers as fortresses. However, if they want to defeat the Russians, they'll now have to conduct major counteroffenses in the south to dislodge the Russians. Their relative lack of heavy arms and armor is going to hurt them in the push. 


Ultimately, the deciding factor will be the nature of the war. To Ukraine, this is their own national Great Patriotic War to defend their country. They're highly motivated. Russia may have an advantage in material and total armed forces, but morale appears to be low. Even if they're inflicting higher casualties than they're receiving, Russia likely won't be able to replenish their units as readily as Ukraine.


So, my prediction is that Ukraine and Russia grind each other down over the coming weeks or months until Ukraine eventually forces Russia out of whatever territory it believes it should have. In that scenario, Donbas is likely returned to Ukraine, but Crimea is likely conceded. That all said, I'm not an expert, so undoubtedly I'll be wrong on some accounts.
