Oh, the _world_'s response - is variable and varying. All kinds of developments. Here's, for example, one big international corporation doing exactly the ""opposite"" thing: instead of anyhow limiting their operations in Russia, this one is expanding it: https://www.businessinsider.com/retailer-looks-expand-russia-business-as-more-firms-pull-out-2022-3 . 

And this is far not the only one. While some CEOs succumb to the emotional propaganda - others quickly take opening sectors of the market. 

This example to merely show how it's all far not black and white. Weapons - much the same deal. Some buy lots more, but some others may end up out of weapon deals: https://theconversation.com/sanctions-against-russia-will-affect-arms-sales-to-africa-the-risks-and-opportunities-180038 , https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/biden-administration-plans-sell-f-15-fighter-jets-egypt , etc.

I heard some western corporations are already resuming their business in Russia - without publicity, hush-hush way. It may be preferential to China to strike while the West is still largely focused on Ukraine situation - both militarily and economically. Sanctions do not only hurt russian economy - they also hurt western economies no small deal. In such situation, powerful potential sanctions by _China_ - against the West - would be significantly more powerful argument than when Russia was largely a part of normal economic relations with the West.

So it's again not black and white. And it is exactly for _near_ future where i do not see your point being much significant. Because, sure, Taiwan may arm itself to the teeth looking at Ukraine, - but can it do in _near_ future? Nope, it takes significant time to arm up properly.

&gt;Keep in mind Russia has an economy the size of Italy

You're using MER. It's a bad measure. Using PPP, which is the correct measure for economic output, Russia's economy is almost as large as Germany's.

&gt;They might have 1200 planes on paper, but how many of them are actually airworthy right now?

According to the latest edition of *The Military Balance*, and not counting strategic bombers, Russia has 832 combat aircraft within operational units. This includes 132 MiG-31 interceptors which, as interceptors, are probably not used over Ukraine.

This leaves 700 combat aircraft, of which 300 have been deployed around Ukraine according to [RUSI](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/mysterious-case-missing-russian-air-force). According to the latest Western estimates, Russia generates roughly [300 sorties per day](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/apparent-shift-strategy-russians-troops-stop-offensive-kyiv/story?id=83676507)... Which corresponds to 1 daily sortie per aircraft deployed.

For comparison's sake, the U.S.-led coalition during Desert Storm made [116,000 sorties over 43 days](https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2512938/30-years-later-desert-storm-remains-a-powerful-influence-on-air-space-forces/), or 2,700 per day. The coalition had about [2,800 fixed-wing aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War_air_campaign), which also corresponds to 1 daily sortie per aircraft deployed.

Thus, there's no evidence that Russia is underperforming at the level of **sortie generation**.

They need to keep fighting until allied forces arrive (if no ally joins them, they are doomed indeed). And that is very much doable.

* They have many targets that are hard to destroy. If China wanted to destroy the taiwanese army from the air it would take too long to do so. China needs to get boots on the ground in numbers before an allied intervention force is able to engange, so they need to limit initial air strikes to a few days at maximum. That severly limits how much they can hit.
* Taiwan can hide some assets. Mountains are great for this, jungle is great, even urban areas can work.
* I agree that sinking chinese transport craft will not happen in significant numbers. But that's because those landing ships will not play a role in chinas campaign until the battle for control of air and see is mostly won, taiwanese anti ship missiles mostly being spent or destroyed. But taiwanese ani ship capabilities will be valuable in delaying this.
* There are not that many suitable beaches for landing operations and china does not have that many marines. Most of then landings will happen in places that are known beforehand. This creates a bottleneck for china, where even comparatively weak forces can inflict much damage. China will try to mitigate this with air force and navy, but they are not going to stop some nearby infantry unit from firing their anti-tank missiles at the landing forces. 
* Taiwanese supply lines aren't that important. They don't need to supply a large mechanized force deep into foreign territory. They need to maintain the ability to fight back in urbanized ares in their own country. Foreign help won't arrive until an allied naval task force break the chinese blockade, so you have to make do with what you have anyways. Create de-centralised storage, design your units to be self-sufficient for some days, integrate military and civilian logistics and taiwan should be good to go for some time - and that is all it needs.

I disagree with OP that this will be a high-tech war. Of course there will be some high-tech involved - taiwan is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, after all - but if china manages an amphibious landing with sufficient numbers, the fighting will come down to light units operating in urban terrain after some time. I guess taiwan would be able to retain parts of its MLRS, drones, cruise missiles and the like, so it will still be able to hit the invaders where it hurts and urban combat operations suck up troops and take a long time.

They don't have enough foreign currency to pay all their debts in USD or EUR. They will default sooner or later.

They don't have enough suppliers to get all they need, nor does China (or anyone else for that matter) produce the goods that Russia is now banned from importing. Those supply chain shortages are not going to be fixed for years. In terms of payments well see how well their circumvention of sanctions goes but I wouldn't be too optimistic.

There's 2 contradictory points you're holding here. 1) the (true) belief that China can only sealift a few brigades at a time and 2) the belief they would need to build up. If 1 is true then 2 is not.

&gt; No. There is no country that rely on those things. Those things working are a best case scenario, only an idiot planes for a best case scenario.

No country besides North Korea *does* rely on those things. Everyone knows the focal pint in a Taiwan war is the actual landing not decapitation and cyber war.

&gt; There's no guessing. They'll literally be able to see the invasion fleet coming 100km away with a pair of binoclaurs

Considering the horizon is barely 3 miles away, no. And even if that were true, at that distance it would still take longer for ground forces to drive to a new location en masse and reposition than for the invasion fleet to arrive there.

&gt; Opposed amphibous assaults against peer power likely not possible for anyone, even if the US. Those ROROs are worthless for the primary assault. They'd only be useful to supply after the battle is won.

Yet the US and Russia both did them in the past 2 decades.

&gt; I don't know if you're actually being serious, but the point the planes can fly low around the mountains to break line of sight locks from Chinese anti air assets.

Seriously? This is the brilliant plan? It has never been done before. The Serbs in 1999 scored some opportunistic kills by hugging the mountain line then climbing rapidly, but they weren't able to get away through the mountains. That would involve plummeting from the air at at least hundreds of miles per hour during a high speed air to air chase, into jagged terrain, then hoping to get a terrain object between you and the enemy's LDSD radar.

&gt; Yeah, the fact that Russia still doesn't have air superiority, and the dozens of down jets on both sides prove that SAM units are useless, I'm sure they're just flying low because they want to wave to MANPADs aimed at them.

Have you turned your computer off for 2 weeks? Russia has almost total air supremacy right now and there are multiple reports of Russian bombings every day. Air kills have ground to a virtual halt.

&gt; SAM don't work by directly hitting aircraft, you literally don't even know how they work. They fly 4x faster than most aircraft and use fragmenation warheads.

Nowhere did I say that. SAMs are ""fast"" but they almost always arrive at a perpendicular angle to the targeted aircraft. Not only are they shot from below, pilots usually have minutes to conduct evasive maneuvers. This is the worst possible angle for a missile hit and why no SAM system has ever achieved its promised hit rate.

&gt; Design is irrelevant nonsense.

What?

&gt; This is also irrelevant. Unless they've spent so much money on the troops they've learned to walk across water.

Spending is absolutely relevant. The reason Russia has underperformed so badly is underfunded forces always cut corners and have holes. 

&gt; 2006 Lebanon taught us this before all of those conflicts, yet armies still keep doing them.

Yes, they do and experience tragedy as a result. We're in similar position as armies 120 years ago. Technology has made mechanized assaults more difficult, but generals don't want to be bothered to change the book and the alternative (creeping, recon-heavy, firepower-based advances) is decidedly uncool compared to WW2-style breakthrough and maneuver warfare. Just as generals in those days were slow to adopt to the realities of trench warfare.

&gt; It weird that this is what you're getting from this? Those are all conflicts with flat land borders. There will be no armored charging tactics because you CANT charge across water.

It's a stretch to say ""surprise is impossible"", especially since surprise attacks have been pulled off as recently as 2003 (nobody expected the American push through the desert towards Nasiriyah).

And how did we see that build up? SATINT. The same way we'd see this one. There's really no serious person who argues that this wouldn't be extremely obvious months in advance. And I'm sure anyone who was looking at SATINT knew what the US was doing in 2003, however they didn't broadcast it and the US didn't broadcast for obvious reasons.

&gt;A country whose military budget per soldier is five times higher, with a first rate tech industry and military equipment that actually works absolutely can.

No. There is no country that rely on those things. Those things working are a best case scenario, only an idiot planes for a best case scenario.

&gt;If the ROC mines the strait before the PLAAF gains air supremacy and the PLAN shuts down the Taiwan strait - i,e. in the first 30 minutes of the war.

PLAAF is unlikely to every gain air superior, modern SAM system are simply to deadly.

&gt;Yes, and 80% of the West coast where all the people live (and the coast facing China) is completely flat. The mountains are concentrated in Eastern and Central Taiwan where 10% of the population lives.

This is irrelevant. You can see the entire strait from those mountains.

&gt;And take off how? Dispersed airbases have been an idea in ""guerrilla air warfare"" for a while, but to take off planes need runways. Where are you going to get a highway long enough to function as a runway here?

I don't know if you're actually being serious, but the point the planes can fly low around the mountains to break line of sight locks from Chinese anti air assets.

&gt;There's 20. The invasion force will almost certainly be less than 6 brigades in the first wave. They need 3 beaches worth of frontage to land. So Taiwan has a 1/6 chance of guessing the right area.

There's no guessing. They'll literally be able to see the invasion fleet coming 100km away with a pair of binoclaurs

&gt;China has the most landing ships in the world, and the 2nd most LHDs. The gap between the US and China in amphibious capability is roughly a 20 or 30% difference. China also owns the most civilian ""roll on roll off"" ships in the world. ""ROROs"" can be appropriated in wartime to deploy tanks and armored vehicles directly onto beaches.

Opposed amphibous assaults against peer power likely not possible for anyone, even if the US. Those ROROs are worthless for the primary assault. They'd only be useful to supply after the battle is won.

&gt;Yes, and the Russians had 100 ballistic missiles for every high value target.

They actually didn't, but ok.

&gt; The problem is acquiring the target, overcoming ECM, overcoming point defense and avoiding launchpad destruction.

Once again, they can literally see the ships with their bare eyes, not to mention numerous radars, IR sensors, and SATINT. They could do a bearing based launch and hit them.

&gt;Iran would have declared war on the United States and sunk the Gulf battle group long ago.

What would Iran get out of that? Seriously what a dumb hypothetical. 

&gt;I don't see how this is ""evidence from the current conflict"" seeing as the Ukrainians used none of these tactics in response to Russian beach landings.

Ukraine has attack Russian boats with anti tank weapons. It's obvious they'd use them on any armored vechiles that did land

&gt;The Russians successfully conducted amphibious landings during this war despite their many deficiencies, simply because Ukraine guessed the wrong beachhead.

I mean you can literally swim to from Russian controlled areas to Mariupol. That's a little different than a 100km strait. And what successful assault are you talking about? I haven't seen reports of any large scale amphibious operation, unless you're talking about Snake Island

&gt;If anything this conflict has proven (yet again) that SAMs are useless.

Yeah, the fact that Russia still doesn't have air superiority, and the dozens of down jets on both sides prove that SAM units are useless, I'm sure they're just flying low because they want to wave to MANPADs aimed at them.

&gt;They face a difficult engineering problem - hit a fast moving, mobile target deploying countermeasures from a static positioning (so, no ""maneuvering onto the enemy's 6"" to acquire a favorable firing angle) and have to be spread out, where SEAD aircraft are easy to concentrate in one place.

SAM don't work by directly hitting aircraft, you literally don't even know how they work. They fly 4x faster than most aircraft and use fragmenation warheads.

&gt;This is the opposite lesson of the current conflict. The vast majority of Ukraine's forces are hastily raised militias and territorial defense units, including official and unofficial conscripts, but they have performed certain kinds of combat actions very well. There is nothing innately inferior about a ""conscript"" besides length of service.

There's no difference between me and a doctor other than the fact I haven't gone to medical school. No one who's served with conscripts will say they're good fighting material. They're less motivated, less trained, and less knowledgeable in worse shape. 

The Ukarine forces have been doing ambushes on Russians driving down the road. The Chinese won't get off, and probably not even on the beach so that's not nearly as relevant. 

&gt;The Chinese army is designed to achieve localized tactical success and outshoot its enemies in the absence of combined arms. The Russian army is an ""order"" army, the PLA is a ""chaos"" army, and there are no two more extreme expressions of those opposing approaches.

Design is irrelevant nonsense. The Russian Army's plan was designed to win this conflict almost a month ago. There's no evidence of PLA being exceptional at anything because they haven't fought a war in decades. All the design in the world doesn't ensure the exection will work. Pretty much nobody thought UA would have an airforce this late in the game.

&gt;Chinese funding per soldier is greater than most of NATO. The naval aspect will be decisive in a Taiwan war, it was a foregone conclusion in the Ukraine war.

This is also irrelevant. Unless they've spent so much money on the troops they've learned to walk across water.

&gt;The singular lesson that you can cross-apply from Ukraine to Taiwan is the obsolescence of traditional armored ""charging"" tactics, a conclusion the Saudi-Yemen war, Nagorno Karabakh War, and Turkish intervention in Syria also taught us. 

2006 Lebanon taught us this before all of those conflicts, yet armies still keep doing them.

&gt;China will come in throwing armored haymakers, seeing no results, then will switch to a firepower-based approach.

It weird that this is what you're getting from this? Those are all conflicts with flat land borders.

[],False,,flossypants,,,[],,,,text,t2_gso7jr0o,False,False,"Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) seems to include nuclear, biological, and chemical. This comment / question considers the implications of Russia detonating a tactical nuclear device in Ukraine. Although I view it as unlikely Russia will detonate a nuclear device, because of the extreme implications, it seems important to consider how the West would respond.

If Russia were on a trajectory to achieve most of their goals with conventional weapons, I don't see a path to them using nuclear weapons. Let's consider a possibility that Russia is on a path to being pushed out of territories they invaded this year over the next 6mos to 2yrs. In this case, various commenters consider the possibility Russia would employ a tactical nuclear weapon to force Ukraine to negotiate an outcome that Russia could frame as more of a success.

Where would Russia target and why? Other comments doubt there's a large enough military target in Ukraine to merit a nuclear device since Ukraine has already dispersed its military assets to prevent them being bombed by conventional arms.

Russia could use a tactical nuke against a population center. While this holds a high likelihood of forcing Ukraine to an unconditional surrender, this has the following problems:

1. The West seems likely to maximize sanctions, banning all direct or indirect commerce with Russia. Gas and oil sales would immediately be turned off to Europe, despite recession implications. China, India, etc. would be asked to immediately choose between retaining access to Western markets or to Russian raw materials. The former appears more valuable to these countries than the latter so I suspect the choice would be clear.

2. While an unconditional surrender would halt ""organized"" resistance, Ukrainian officials might resign across-the-board, forcing Russia to support an expensive, repressive government subject to an ongoing ""informal"" insurgency campaign, still supported by the West (i.e. Russia's military risk is reduced but maybe not substantially).

3. If Russia annexed Ukraine and retained democracy, that would add a substantial population of voters committed to changing the Russian regime.

Russia could detonate a nuclear device against a relatively unoccupied territory as a demonstration. However, although it's less likely the West would maximize sanctions, sanctions would likely be raised substantially (and they might still be raised maximally). Ukraine might also call Russia's bluff and not concede, banking that Russia wouldn't further escalate and use tactical nukes against population centers.

If Russia detonates a tactical nuke against Ukraine, I'd appreciate others thoughts on if/how the West might also escalate militarily. For example, what's the likelihood that the West wheels a tactical nuclear cruise missile launcher across the border into Ukraine that's preprogrammed to target a Russian-controlled area inside Ukraine (e.g. Crimea military-related infrastructure such as its port, the bridge to Russia, etc.) and provides Ukraine with the launch control. Ukraine would publicly take credit for the launch and it would be somewhat ambiguous who provided Ukraine with the weapon.

Would this approach lessen the risk of proliferation by preventing smaller, less stable countries from using the nukes offensively (they're preprogrammed for defensive targets within their own borders that are less-likely to escalate)? Would this approach be less likely to provoke an escalation akin to the Cuban missile crisis?

This approach could then be a prototype for how the US might defend Taiwan, by programming the nukes with Taiwan's beachheads, Chinese naval groups, and Chinese sandbar/bases while providing Taiwan authority and responsibility for detonating the weapons.",d2e5de0bbc86f3e9a7fa958c3921160fd884808f,True,False,,,,,0,1648490373,,0,{},i2gr4tv,False,t3_tjrn7m,False,False,t3_tjrn7m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjrn7m/the_smaller_bombs_that_could_turn_ukraine_into_a/i2gr4tv/,1648490391,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648461573.0,

[],False,,Kiltymchaggismuncher,,,[],,,,text,t2_5732rxf0,False,False,"I would argue that China was not a great power at the same time period either. In the same manner that the ottomans were not. A great power has the ability to exert significant control over its smaller neighbours. China and the ottomans were stagnant and unable to project power abroad in any meaningful way. Russia was restricted to targeting such states as China and ottomans because they were such an easy target.

In the modern sense you can look at other examples, namely India and Brazil. As yet I would not say either of them are great powers, Brazil has had promises of becoming one and may yet do so. India as well are heavily moving in that direction too. You could say they are regional powers (and again its true of India and Brazil currently), but to a great power the theatre of war shouldn't matter too much, you should be able to exert power abroad either directly, or through your proxies. Russia was rarely able to do this on the independent European states, much of whom where not great powers either.
China still has a lot of wealth inequalities and social issues, but they have a growing military which includes foreign operation capabilities, and there's no denying they are creating proxies through their silk road initiatives. In that regard they are easily a great power. 
I think one of the big hindrances to Russia achieving great power status, is they were unable to institute significant reform. 
An example of this is the fact that serfdom was only abolished in the 19th century in Russia. They tried several times but the central authority could never muster enough strength to carry it through. 
In contrast, it was largely removed in the british Isles by the 16th century. 

They wanted to form a western style military and powerbase, however much like the late era byzantine and ottoman empire, the rulers were largely immobilised from significant reform by the powerful Russian aristocracy. In contrast, you can see with the Japanese empire that their future rulers were sent to the west for education. They came back and introduced Western reforms, and quickly ballooned at the expense of their weak neighbours. This includes Russia, who were soundly humiliated in the russo Japanese war. 

During the era of the ussr, they had the gift of a very cheap and large workforce, and a low level of industrialisation which allowed them to rapidly grow their revenues year after year, largely by copying and in some cases looting European industry. They literally exported entire factories from occupied European states. 

Eventually they found the same problem, that without social and economic reform they would stagnate again. 

Even before recent sanctions hit Russia, they were one of the weakest economies in Europe. That includes the former territories of Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia etc. 

Part of the issue here is that Russia has rarely if ever had free market competition. In the early years of the russian state, serfdom prevented significant industrialisation and the growth of a middle class. In the era of the ussr, growth was driven by the level of power the central state had and the fact they didn't have to make any reimbursements to those who's property or labour they expropriated. 
In the modern russian state, you can only really succeed in a big way if you are on good terms with the government. Huge industries are under the rule of those who donate to the officials up the chain, not those who are knowledgeable in the industry. Equally corruption is so endemic, that even when incentives are developed to kick-start the economy, little of that money makes it to the intended target. 

Essentially, I think the biggest hindrance to them past and present, is that they have consistently failed to make significant political and economic reforms. Those in power seek to hoard the wealth at the expense of the state, and when that happens an empire is easy pickings for other powers. Their peak was absolutely during the day's of the ussr, russia would be well placed to reclaim great power status, if they were to make a meaningful anti corruption drive as well as try to make a few regional allies other than china",736931c2ca6d4e4850ff40df55da95b5c9ebbcc6,True,False,,,,,0,1648486805,,0,{},i2gideu,False,t3_tplpwn,False,True,t1_i2fy7wy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tplpwn/historically_has_russia_always_wanted_control/i2gideu/,1648486820,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648458005.0,

[],False,,TikiTDO,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yp3u,False,False,"A key factor here is that reduced corruption doesn't mean you won't need a military at all. Any sufficiently large nation will have military interests regardless of the culture and degree of corruption. In other words military investment is still necessary, it's just a matter of how much you get from that investment. When you consider that well managed military investment can have huge effects in other domains (consider how the US was able to leverage the invention of the internet), then it makes all the more sense that you want these investments to be maximally effective.

One of the key lessons of modern times is that there is a degree of military capability that essentially makes you next to immune from wars of aggression. Once you have a large enough nuclear force, the risk of a war of aggression against you goes down significantly. You need only look at nations like North Korea for an example. So while it's true that having other types of soft-power can make you more of a threat, the risk of that can be mitigated by having an cost-effective military force that you can use as a threat against anyone that might have interests contrary to your own.

In other words, while having more non-military power *does* make you a bigger threat on the global scale, if you can project such power while also having a sufficient effective military is generally enough to head off most major conflicts. What more, such power is usually much more effective at creating influence on the regional scale. While having economic and social influence might make the US wary, it will generally have a better effect on your immediate neighbors who have more direct connections to your nation.

What more, a military actor is just as easily provoked by a show of weakness, so the idea that less corruption provokes military actors doesn't really check out. An entity with a large military force and few other types of projecting power will tend to look towards military solutions to problems, simply by virtue of not having other ways to solve problems.

To your point, a nation with extensive ability to affect the economic, technological, and social conflict domains is going to have more options for pushing their agenda, while a nation without this ability is going to have less. This is why we have Islamic clerics pushing for a military response in response to ""moral societal corruption."" The cleric simply does not have other options available to him, so he can only call for violence. Meanwhile, western nations can conduct warfare in all the other domains, leaving military intervention as the last and most dangerous form of escalation. In practice, the types of military interventions these powers engage with tend to be more limited and targeted, because their superior cost effectiveness allows them to invest in better weapons and training, which in turn reduces the risk of engaging in such operations.

In that case, it's not a matter of ""our enemy hates us because he is weak, and he is weak because he hates us."" It's more a matter of ""our enemy is not making cost-effective investments, and because he is not making cost-effective investments he can not fight within domains that require such investments, so he can only fight in the most basic conflict domain."" Basically, we don't need the enemy to have any emotional investment in us; a corrupt entity will be less effective than a non corrupt entity even if that entity is friendly to us. I mean, as a simple example, Greece is very corrupt, and as a result they are a less effective ally than they would be if they were less corrupt. I would argue that Greece does not hate us, but corruption still affects them negatively.

In terms of empirically verifying the idea that corruption leads to a higher willingness to use military force, you would really need to gather specific data on types and scale of military interactions as a percentage of all interactions the nation engages with. Things like military investment as percentage of GDP only really tells you how much risk a nation feels it's under, not necessarily how frequently that military gets used, and in what context. While getting such empirical data is hard, looking at a [list like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts), or [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars:_2003%E2%80%93present), we see a pattern; most nations engaged in conflict tend to score fairly high on the list of corrupt countries, and fairly low on the list of countries able to effectively influence non-military domains. The only examples tend to be larger countries that use the smaller ones as proxies, but I would argue that part of the reason that proxy warfare is so common is directly because these smaller countries are more corrupt, and therefore easier for larger countries to manipulate. A less corrupt country would be harder to proxy, because the people that you would seek to turn against each other would be more likely to communicate and resolve their differences more peaceably. 

Finally, in terms of military action being the impetus for reforming corrupt structures, I would argue that is an effect of the leadership becoming aware of how much effectiveness they are losing due to corruption. If you send in your well funded military against a smaller foe and find them getting spanked, you're absolutely going to look into why your investment has not paid off. When you find that the problem comes down to corruption, it makes perfect sense that you would want to reduce this problem.",0125ad3095f5005c67703a5c89959d436dfa1cd8,True,False,,,,,0,1648486391,,0,{},i2ghbxg,False,t3_tbx9bb,False,True,t1_i2ehu88,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbx9bb/russian_military_performance_in_ukraine_shows/i2ghbxg/,1648486407,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648457591.0,

I wonder how freely the Ukrainians are able to move. It sounds like they're flying minimal sorties, keeping their air force as a ""fleet in being."" Seems like armor is held in reserve as well. Someone mentioned using helicopters to move squads around but that seems like too many eggs in one basket unless you absolutely know where air defense and fighters are, which maybe they do thanks to NATO. 

I know they are able to move artillery pieces close enough to engage and evade destruction which is kinda nuts because that means getting within 10 to 40km of the enemy which should be right where close air support is working, unless the Russians are avoiding flying around the front lines for risk of friendly fire. You think the choppers could work there but maybe not.

As the other person said, sanctions are only part of it. Russia's demographic issues, and inability to foster their own industries, and lack of internal funding sources, has caused them to rely on outside industry and funding increasingly over the past couple decades.   
For instance, western oil companies unexpectedly pulling out of Russia is causing major problems for them raising funds, servicing wells, exporting oil via ship, etc. They already had a growing problem with failing wells, if wells aren't constantly used/maintained or permanently plugged they start to fail. Russia wants to build more oil and gas pipelines and upgrade rail for increased coal exports, but those projects need hundreds of billions from outside funding, imported equipment, and years to construct, which Russia cannot do for now.  
In the past few years they've had problems taking advantage of economic prospects in other areas. For instance, there was a growth in demand for coal from Russia by China but the Russian's just didn't have enough manpower and rail cars available to increase supply and take advantage of it. Due to this, and maybe showing they're not so supportive of Russia after all, China is requesting their own coal mines increase capacity this year by 300 million tons because they know Russia wont be able to supply their needs (and they are still banning imports from Australia).   
So really the sanctions are having a significant effect on day to day life of Russians, but on top of that any ability for Russia to make up for them by increasing oil/gas/coal sales elsewhere cannot happen and in the long run losing manpower/expertise and not being able to access outside equipment, technology, funding, etc is going to cause a domino effect of further issues in the coming years and decades.",b9a316b61a5321f45fe2250d97dd7e1207576d04,True,False,,,,,0,1648484003,,0,{},i2gbbio,False,t3_tqaarh,False,True,t1_i2g177i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqaarh/ukraine_megathread_march_28/i2gbbio/,1648484018,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648455203.0,

My opinion as well, this whole NATO vs Russia in a conventional war thing is dick measuring in the first place, which I am 100% down for.

&gt;I think the point he is making in that tweet (from listening to his analysis on podcasts hes been on) is that the Russia we're seeing here is not the Russia that NATO would be fighting against.

Ok, so he is still talking about Russia, but a theoretical Russia that plays better.

&gt;I think he's somewhat right in that assessment (though maybe a little over-cautious), since a lot of the problems that Russia is facing in Ukraine - overconfidence, under-motivation, lackadaisical command, not enough troops, no full mobilisation, fear of losing air assets - would all be somewhat mitigated in the context of a war with NATO.

I'm actually pretty unsure that a lot of those problems **would** get better in a larger war against a more technologically adept foe, and those that would get better might get replaced by other problems (which you did mention).

Like I don't wanna write an essay, but as an example - the ""fear of losing air assets"" thing - Russia's worried about losing planes against a nation that's exclusively using their old anti-air technology and their old planes, and comparatively not many of either.

In Eastern Ukraine you'd have a hard time telling accents apart. Ukrainians there speak perfect Russian.

This one is really easy if you assume it's an isolated incident. Just as an example, imagine some Ukrainian soldier got shot in the leg, and one of his buddies is taking it out of POWs.

I've been posting about this for years via my old accounts, but the key problem of the Russian armed forces since 1991 has been crippling underfunding compared to their size - $20,000/year/soldier. This is less than Ukraine, 1/3 that of most of NATO, 1/4 that of China, and *1/20th* that of the United States. No matter what brilliant ideas GenShtab has come up with in the past 30 years, they have the money to execute none of them.

Aside from that, Russian incompetence in this war is only unique in degree. The key reason its offensives have failed is the same reason the Saudis got blunted in Yemen and the Turks got blunted in Syria. Advances in affordable, portable anti-tank weapons have made traditional armored breakthroughs a thing of the past. This is a lesson few armies are willing to accept. Like in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War and Balkan Wars, major power armies today are looking at the current Russian offensive difficulties and saying ""we would do much better"". Here's the thing - no we wouldn't. We would do a little better, not much better. As with the situation 120 years ago, technology has presented a new problem for attackers, and it will take an entirely new doctrine to solve those problems.

We have some indication of what this doctrine would look like based on the successful Turkish-advised Azeri operation in Nagorno Karabakh. After bloodying their nose against Shi'a ATGM teams in Syria, the Turks developed a doctrine emphasizing excellent aerial ISR, slow mechanized advances, and precise land-based and drone-based fire support. The focus shifted away from conducting sweeping charges deep into enemy territory, and towards seeking localized tactical success through leveraging direct fire, indirect fire, and geography.

Critically, however, none of this was applicable 40 years ago when the height of affordable shoulder fired rockets was the RPG.

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"&gt; It's impossible to hide an invasion force. Pretty much everyone saw the possibility of this invasion coming from miles away.

Because Putin was publicly building up forces on the border as a threat. It's a stretch to say ""surprise is impossible"", especially since surprise attacks have been pulled off as recently as 2003 (nobody expected the American push through the desert towards Nasiriyah).

&gt; One cannot rely on things like sabotage, sleeper cells, decaption strikes, special ops and cyber warfare.

*Russia* can't rely on those things. A country whose military budget per soldier is five times higher, with a first rate tech industry and military equipment that actually works absolutely can.

&gt; You're look at least a 5 hour journey for any amphibious transport across the Taiwanese strait, and that's if they taking the quickest route possible. Note that the quickest route possible is a straight line, and the Taiwanese will be able to that line to a rough approximation, so they will likely need to add in time for minesweeping.

If the ROC mines the strait before the PLAAF gains air supremacy - i,e. in the first 30 minutes of the war.

&gt; Taiwanese mountains are tall, almost two miles in some places

Yes, and 80% of the West coast where all the people live (and, you know, the coast facing China) is completely flat. The mountains are concentrated in Eastern and Central Taiwan where 10% of the population lives.

&gt; Taiwanese airforce can use the mountains to hide from certain Chinese ISR assets.

And take off how? Dispersed airbases have been an idea in ""guerrilla air warfare"" for a while, but to take off planes need runways. Where are you going to get a highway long enough to function as a runway [here](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/travel/img/attachement/jpg/site1/20141117/0023ae69624d15d3cfa004.jpg)?

&gt; They are few beaches that the Chinese can land at, funneling their forces into well prepared kill boxes

There's 20. The invasion force will almost certainly be less than 6 brigades in the first wave. They need 3 beaches worth of frontage to land. So Taiwan has a 1/6 chance of guessing the right area.

&gt; The nature of amphibious warfare leaves very little room for error. China's amphibious assault capacity is not particularly large

Where are you getting that? China has the most landing ships in the world, and the 2nd most LHDs. The gap between the US and China in amphibious capability is roughly a 20 or 30% difference. China also owns the most civilian ""roll on roll off"" ships in the world. ""ROROs"" can be appropriated in wartime to deploy tanks and armored vehicles directly onto beaches.

&gt; so it's very possible for Taiwan to have 100 anti ship missiles for every ship .

Yes, and the Russians had 100 ballistic missiles for every high value target. The problem is acquiring the target, overcoming ECM, overcoming point defense and avoiding launchpad destruction. If it was as simple as ""we have more missiles than you have ships"", Iran would have declared war on the United States and sunk the Gulf battle group long ago.

&gt; Evidence from the current conflict shows us that any force on the landing beach would be very vulnerable. Anti tank munitions like Javeline and drones can destroy their vehicles before they even land, those that do land will have no cover from MLRS which can strike from far away concealed positions. A single MLRS volley can kill everyone on a landing beach.

I don't see how this is ""evidence from the current conflict"" seeing as the Ukrainians used none of these tactics in response to Russian beach landings. The one lesson about amphibious warfare we can draw from the current conflict is that defending is not as easy as pre-war experts thought. The Russians successfully conducted amphibious landings during this war despite their many deficiencies, simply because Ukraine guessed the wrong beachhead.

&gt; Something like Israelis Iron Dome would be ideal, alot of relatively cheap missiles that can easily be mass produced and spread all over the island.

[Drone jammers](https://www.janes.com/images/default-source/news-images/fg_1463496-idr-2132.jpg?sfvrsn=965a636c_2) and AAA are cheaper and more effective. Drones have small profiles and are not easy to shoot down with missiles, nor is that an efficient use of ordnance.

&gt; Invest heavily into anti air. China can not hope to win without complete air superiority, so you must ensure you have anti air assets in spades, both in terms of radars, missiles, and mobility. Abandon all anti air assets that are static. Make sure all the vechiles are up to date as far as maintenance is concerned.

If anything this conflict has proven (yet again) that SAMs are useless. I made a longer post about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/tjz9qp/is_there_an_air_defense_gap_in_western_militaries/i1nyt9z/?context=3), but the short version is that SAMs have never achieved the hit rates promised by their manufacturers. Since the Yom Kippur War when they were first deployed, they have never again been decisive in any conflict. They face a difficult engineering problem - hit a fast moving, mobile target deploying countermeasures from a static positioning (so, no ""maneuvering onto the enemy's 6"" to acquire a favorable firing angle) and have to be spread out, where SEAD aircraft are easy to concentrate in one place.

&gt; Use conscripts for logistics and recon, not fighting. This is going to be a war of tech, where you're going to win by using very sosphicated weapons, that are only useful when used by very well trained troops.

This is the opposite lesson of the current conflict. The vast majority of Ukraine's forces are hastily raised militias and territorial defense units, including official and unofficial conscripts, but they have performed certain kinds of combat actions very well. There is nothing innately inferior about a ""conscript"" besides length of service. Complex MOSes that require years in seat to master of course can only be serviced by professionals (as they are even in ""conscript armies""), but 90% of ground force roles can be done with less than a year of training. As for morale, it goes both ways. Conscripts can be ""fighting a war they disagree with"", or they can be a ""citizen army"", a ""nation in arms"". Since the Taiwanese public is broadly in favor of resisting an invasion, conscripts are not going to have the same problem as the Russians did in Ukraine.

More broadly, this conflict teaches us almost nothing about a Straits Conflict. There are no two forces more different than the Russian and Chinese armies. The former is the most extreme expression of the French military philosophy (methodical battle, coordinated operations, centralized command), while the latter is the most extreme expression of the German military philosophy. Russia only ever had French advisers, and its army was raised during centuries of centralized autocracy. Imperial China only took on German and Japanese advisers (the latter themselves following an extreme version of German doctrine), and the PLA was born as guerrillas. The Russian army is exceptional for its mass of artillery - indirect fire support. The Chinese army is exceptional for its massing of automatic grenade launchers, HMGs, RCLs, and AAA (which can be used against infantry) - direct fire support. The Russian army is designed to crush enemies in methodical combined arms operations. The Chinese army is designed to achieve localized tactical success and outshoot its enemies in the absence of combined arms. The Russian army is an ""order"" army, the PLA is a ""chaos"" army, and there are no two more extreme expressions of those opposing approaches.

Materially and geographically virtually nothing is the same either. The Russians were invading a steppe with a wide border, the Chinese are conducting an amphibious landing. The Russian army is the most underfunded great power force in the world, spending around $20,000 per soldier. Chinese funding per soldier is greater than most of NATO. The naval aspect will be decisive in a Taiwan war, it was a foregone conclusion in the Ukraine war.

The *singular* lesson that you can cross-apply from Ukraine to Taiwan is the obsolescence of traditional armored ""charging"" tactics, a conclusion the Saudi-Yemen war, Nagorno Karabakh War, and Turkish intervention in Syria also taught us. The proliferation of ATGMs has made armor easier to destroy than ever before, and the Russians, like the Turks and Saudis before them, have had to learn that the only way to conduct an offensive now adays is through excellent ISR and overwhelming fire support.

This, by the way, is not a conclusion favorable to the Chinese who have always preferred maneuver warfare, and, compared to the Russians are deficient in artillery. I fully expect a Taiwan landing to follow the same pattern as the Turks in Syria and the Russians in Ukraine - China will come in throwing armored haymakers, seeing no results, then will switch to a firepower-based approach.",baa21f3f04cdce50adf23513cc69c4c56e050d23,True,False,,,,,0,1648480959,,0,{},i2g3s0u,False,t3_tpodnr,False,True,t3_tpodnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpodnr/what_the_invasion_tells_us_about_a_potential/i2g3s0u/,1648480970,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648452159.0,

It is longer than our normal submissions but it worth the time for sure, there is very little fat on it.

I have tried to read about the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan before but most sources are from the 1980s, are entire books I cannot get, or are really about the US presence there. 

I was not expecting this rationale for the invasion. History rhyming I suppose.

&gt; Not all of them look plausible. For instance, one rationale cited during the Dec. 8 meeting of five Politburo members in Brezhnev’s study was the need to prevent Iraq from getting access to Afghanistan’s uranium deposits, which Baghdad could have then used to build nuclear weapons. That concern was raised by Ustinov and Andropov, according to Lyakhovsky’s aforementioned book.

There are many parallels to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and fascinating buffoonery in the article. 

* The military leadership was forced out of any decision making despite their objections. 

* Brezhnev was an aging leader who felt personally insulted by the Afghan leader for his murder of his predecessor, because he had met him just a month before. 

* The Soviet military men on the ground in Afghanistan were completely kept out of the loop and heard of the invasion from foreign radio. 

* The assassination of Amin by a KGB agent being thwarted by KGB doctors who were there to protect the Afghan leader is just so extreme it is like secret agent Keystone Cops. 

* The near subordination levels of deliberate ignorance by the Soviet military leadership of the military lessons learned in Afghanistan reminds of some of the US commanders sent there after so many years. Believing it is not a real war almost predisposes you to lose.

This article examines the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and makes individual arguments for them citing historical facts and research. Here are the outlines of the lessons. 

Lesson 1: Before making final decisions on issues of fundamental importance, such as military intervention, determine what national interests are at stake, what options exist for advancing or defending those interests and what costs and benefits each of these options would generate, both direct and indirect; and do not let leaders’ personal ambitions impact the ultimate decision.

Lesson 2: Ensure a sufficiently broad and comprehensive inter-agency process of reviewing potential decisions to use force, factoring in the views of all key stakeholders in general and those to be tasked with implementing the decisions in particular.

Lesson 3: Examine aspects of a country’s history relevant to your planned undertaking.

Lesson 4: Once the decision to send troops has been made, formulate the goals of the intervention and communicate them clearly to the agencies involved in implementation; also, shape your messaging to other key stakeholders likely to influence the outcome of the intervention.

Lesson 5: If you do decide to go in, develop an exit plan in advance.

Lesson 6: Once in, ensure effective inter-agency coordination and cooperation.

Lesson 7: Rather than try to mold your local allies in your own image, empower them, encouraging self-reliance, and pay attention to indigenous traditions.

Lesson 8: You cannot succeed in a military intervention unless the side on whose behalf you intervene is willing to fight for your joint cause.

Lesson 9: Talk to moderates on the opposite side.

Lesson 10: When leaving, leave…

Lesson 11: …but before you leave, secure enforceable guarantees that POWs and MIAs are found and brought home, and give the returning soldiers proper welcome and care.

Lesson 12: …also before you leave, secure firm and enforceable agreements that would not only meet your own minimum requirements for a negotiated settlement, but also those of your local allies, because the end of an intervention by itself cannot end hostilities.

Lesson 13: Even after you leave, prevent mission creep.

Lesson 14: Last but not least: Be willing to learn the lessons.",4e0279ae3cbe70a3dca4413700f957e9b932e6a0,True,False,,,,,0,1648479475,,0,{},i2g08br,True,t3_tqb0fm,False,True,t3_tqb0fm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqb0fm/lessons_for_leaders_what_afghanistan_taught/i2g08br/,1648479492,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648450675.0,

That's part of the reason why Russian arguments about the need for buffer states as a security concern are so patently ridiculous.

Why? Geography - specifically the Great European Plain, which is a big wide plain stretching from France into the heart of Russia. Big wide open plains make it MUCH easier to attack than mountain ranges

From France to Germany and really about halfway through Poland, the plain stays quite narrow, which means there’s much less of it to defend. But then through Poland it starts to widen up and when you get to the Baltics, Belarus, and Ukraine the plain is basically the whole width of the continent north-south, from Varna in Bulgaria to Narva in Estonia, and about 1100 miles/1800km long - an impossible front to try to defend

Hitler and Napoleon’s invasions, plus dozens of others over the centuries, have rolled into Russia along this plain, being repelled only due to winter and ruinous loss of life, and thus control of it is pretty important to Russia

Russia has therefore always wanted to control Eastern Europe as far as Poland, because it makes it much easier to defend Russia’s eastern border. If you want to understand Russia’s foreign policy, understand the Great European Plain

I don’t think the PRC had the intent to do a full scale amphibious invasion in the immediate future prior to this war (though of course they do have plans drafted for the contingency and hold the option to do so).  They are even less likely to want to do a full scale invasion after seeing how this is turning out for Russia, unless Taiwan actually is on the verge of declaring independence.

\- Hiding an invasion would definitely be tricky, for one thing Taiwan has island right on China's doorstep, I'm sure those are full of sensors. They're also a huge asset for Taiwan to retaliate China, meaning China would invade them first, giving more warning to Taiwan that the fight is truly on. Taiwan also has sea based sensors, submarines, not to mention intel coming from its regional allies that would easily warn them. That said there was a story I think last year of a Chinese guy who claimed to have crossed the straight in a small boat, which raises the question what if China just sends tens of millions of ""immigrants"" across the water in small ships, I doubt Taiwan can stop them all or destroy them.

\- Don't underestimate China's potential for special warfare operations and tactics, they don't think like any Western country, the lives of their people are quite expendable in their eyes, they would happily air drop a few million onto Taiwan and lose all of them. One can only imagine what crazy things they'd be willing to do to conquer Taiwan, more on that below.

\- Crossing the sea is definitely a bitch, Taiwan can have some nasty storm weather that would make crossing very tricky, never mind landing troops while under fire. And every second ships don't deploy they're troops is another second they can be sunk and all their cargo lost to the waves. For the invasion of the UK the Navy estimated it would need several weeks just to clear the mines, I imagine it'd be similar here.

\- Taiwan has a lot of mountains, even right on the coast (Kaohsiung), which might have been tunneled out in secret decades ago, possibly even by Japanese forces during WW2. Combined with all the other natural terrain features and man made constructs, you've got a huge amount of rough terrain to easily hide an army, never mind a single guy with a missile launcher that can blow up a landing ship as it comes in. Regardless of where China lands they'll have artillery and missile launchers aimed at them, and even a single shot going through could cause massive losses.

\- Taiwan already has a massive amount of infantry and mobile missile launchers, and buying and developing ever more. They'd sit out any Chinese air campaign, while air dropped troops would get slaughtered by guerilla warfare (even Taiwanese old ladies are hardcore, and even they can push the button on a boobytrap) and even Taiwan's light tank force. Then they'd blast Chinese troops as they tried to land, and use their domestic cruise missiles to hit Chinese cities. Meanwhile their island position would allow other countries to supply them from the sea or the sky despite any Chinese embargo, as the US in previous conflicts, and NATO is doing now in Ukraine.

\- Speaking of which Taiwan is now developing its own large submarines, I thought that was silly to fight in littoral waters but now I realize these would be vital in keeping Taiwan from being surrounded, they'd probably also hide out in Philippines or Japanese waters, or trail US fleets to stop China from hitting them, similar to Vietnamese jets using Chinese air space to launch hit and run attacks.

\- I'm not sure the East coast of Taiwan will be out of ballistic missile range, China could just load up its large bombers with missiles, have them flank the island and launch at a safe distance. Building that huge air base there into a mountain made sense until recently, but now China has a massive air superiority advantage and it seems like a waste of money. Building more small bases spread out across the island from where to launch missiles and drones would have made more sense, those don't need runways for one thing.

\- China will definitely get air superiority, and fast. They've had fleets of unmanned Migs ready to go for a long time, these would swarm Taiwanese air defenses while manned jets use them as cover to place precision attacks. That mountain air base for one would get quickly cratered, Taiwan is very proud of the speed of their airstrip repair but how can you repair if there's a bomb falling like every half hour, and drones waiting overhead to strike your repair teams?

\- Taiwan can use more air defense systems but the Patriot is rather limited in range and expensive, it'd run out fast against China's drone swarms. Something like an S-400 would be much more useful, able to strike Chinese aircraft even over the mainland, that would make them think twice.

\- In the same sense I think offense is the best defense for Taiwan, much of China's key assets are within easy striking range. I understand the US has been trying to limit Taiwan's efforts to gain long range offensive capabilities to prevent escalation, although seeing as they stopped caring in Ukraine maybe Biden will sell Tomahawks now to Taiwan. Taipei did decide to reverse engineer the F-5 engine and use it to power its own long range cruise missiles.

\- My main point is that all these shows that invading Taiwan would be super costly for China and thus why they'll resort to special warfare strategies. Maybe they'd use a tsunami bomb to wipe the island clean (the US has had such a weapon since WW2), but I believe they've already infected most of the Taiwanese population with a bioweapon. In a matter of months they'll activate it, killing most of the Taiwanese, and all China will need to do is walk in and repopulate.",c86166e1727276a616b00888cad8419e82aaf336,True,False,,,,,0,1648470180,,0,{},i2fgxi3,False,t3_tpodnr,False,True,t3_tpodnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpodnr/what_the_invasion_tells_us_about_a_potential/i2fgxi3/,1648470191,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648441380.0,

Take that idea, for a simple starting point. If you assume that a lot of things work that way, they become more potent, more lethal. 

It removes a bit of nuance. Everyone thought Ukraine would fold in a few days, why? Because life wouldn't get into the way, every Russian decision would be the correct one, every vehicle would have a full tank of fuel.  Every soldier that went over the border would fight like a lion, every aircraft would have 100% serviceability and accuracy. 

Is that over-estimating? I don't think so. I don't think it's fearmongering either. It's prudent, and somewhat conservative. 

Keep in mind, that the Cold War wasn't one period, but 4 periods. Also, a clearer picture has come out from after the wall came down. 

I define the 4 periods as :

1945-1949 - Asymmetrical Nuclear warfare.  
1949-1963 - No ICBMs   
1963-1980 -  Vietnam era.   
1980-1988 - Western Resurgence

During each phase, both sides had strengths and weaknesses and the estimates change. 

Was the Soviet threat overstated? *History, and access to the east said yes.* 

Read Mig-Pilot, or Inside the Soviet Army or Fulcrum. All 3 based on accounts of defectors, and all 3 paint a less than Rosy picture for the Soviets. A lot of what they said was also found to be true by looking at documents, plans, histories and the equipment. 

I also recommend you read Red Storm Rising, First Clash, The third world war, and the third world war 1985, as well as Team Yankee. All those books are fictional, and take place in a fictitious third world war, written by informed individuals. They come to some interesting conclusions. There's actually two editions of the third world war, that show two different outcomes based on measures the west took. 

The reason I say read them, despite being fictional as it shows a certain amount of ""application"" of the Soviet threat. First Clash was based on doctrine, and how 4 CMBG would fight in Germany. Team Yankee, although a techno-thriller showed Soviet Doctrine in action (The idea that eventually if they survived M1s would be fighting old T-55s). Red Storm Rising had it's battles played out in Harpoon.

For more serious reading, the Newport War Game series is great - [https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=newport-papers](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=newport-papers)

&gt;The UK's attorney general has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine over the Russian invasion.  
  
Suella Braverman said Sir Howard Morrison would become an independent adviser to Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova.

It comes as Russian forces continue to be accused of violating international law by targeting civilians.  
  
Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of committing war crimes after it launched air strikes in Kharkiv that hit an opera house, a concert hall and government offices.

It will also not be a linear process. Russia started with an all around initiative that has by now largely stalled expect for Donbas and Ukraine taking small initiatives on other fronts.

As already addressed by u/EqualArgument4063, you are woefully ignorant of the actual military situation. Bomb South Korea? That's the slightest China would do. If South Korea joins US's war effort against China in a Taiwan scenario, China and NK will bulldoze SK from north.

&gt;It's not unrestricted submarine warfare, it's a naval blockade. This is all pointless because once we freeze their bank accounts they'll probably be unable to actually buy any of it. They'll be unable to get insurance for the tankers. We're not going to have sink any ships, because no ships are going to even attempt to run it. How much money would someone have to pay to run a blockade against the US Navy.

How do you enforce a naval blockade? How do you freeze China's bank accounts, unlike Russia, most of which reside in Chinese banks in China? Attempt? Do you know how many sanction-busting oil tankers that are CURRENTLY moving oil between Iran and China every day?

1. PRC land based aviation, missiles (east coast by PLAN) can degrade TW capacity with only minutes of warning. Unlike RU who had the option of gambling with lightening land attack, PRC's only choice is massive effort to secure air supremacy. Even absent RU airforce has established relative air superiority, losing less than 20 air frames after a month, and mostly because they were flying low due to lack of PGMs. Also this is with entire NATO flying ISR near UKR to provide intelligence to UKR AA over airspace close to RU. There aren't many sovereign airspace to support TW with ISR that wouldn't be prone to PRC pulling EP3/Hainan ""incidents"".

2. I'd note TW is so small and contains enough PRC loyalist that they can feasibly provide intelligence across the island. On cyber, it's interesting Biden noted both to PRC and RU that any attack on US cyber is one of few scenarios that warrants hot war, indicating such capabilities are real and likely reserved for peer level deterrence. So maybe this is something TW should explore more. 

3. But as easy as it gets to starve TW into submission or at least irrelevance. As others have mentioned, TW has a few months of reserves of essentials, knock out power + refrigeration + food stores and island starves in days. Also impossible to resupply via air, will require massive flagged merchant fleet to supply 24M people... which no one has. Private/commercial out of the question, RU sunk 3 ships + mines = UKR commercial trade dead in black sea. Other subpoints assumes invasion, or geography will make TW assets survivable... as if any radars mounted on TW mountains won't be priority targets. There's enough PLAN magazine depth to turn east side mountain bases into sealed crypts as well.

4. PLAN acquisitions is designed to counter USN and IMO deliberately does not waste funds on massive military amphib because invasion will draw on merchant fleet (~8x larger than US peak US fleet during WW2), many of which built to military standards. There's also 50-80,000 other commercial hulls that can make the journey which can be disposably shored anywhere along TW coast. PRC has built up enough naval capita to pull of a million man swim, well a million men on 20,000 ships, and still have 30,000 left over to be decoys and clear mines. Of course that's hyperbolically ridiculous human wave option, but the scale for sealift is that huge. For reference Dunkirk moved 350k with only 800 vessels in a week. 

5. Current conflict shows that UKR is incapable of contesting RU in regions where RU focuses on adequate air coverage (the entire relatively unmolested 40mile convoy meme). Expect similar concentration of force in key areas to provide relatively uncontested landing after weeks of softening up. And that was RU being supremely incompetent. But the beaches will be incredibly mined, just from PRC, along entire TW coast, in perpetuity to starve the island into capitulation. 

As for recommendations, I just want to point out the host of recent congressional testimonies on PRC/TW force balance that basically states TW can't sustain a fight against PRC alone. As in, no amount of acquisitions and pre war buildup will drastically alter equation. High tier platforms a waste - there's not much to do but hole up in cities and hope for outside intervention, i.e. the parts of current UKR war effort that seems to be working well.",6d94f827c45e128a1ceee52d8954f7195f6952a9,True,False,,,,,0,1648447186,,0,{},i2envb2,False,t3_tpodnr,False,True,t3_tpodnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpodnr/what_the_invasion_tells_us_about_a_potential/i2envb2/,1648447196,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648418386.0,

I feel if Putin has actually worked on the corruption for real not cemented oligarchy, if he managed to get Russia to be prosperous commensurate with its size like China.

First of all maybe he’d likely have been able to get Crimea through soft power and diplomacy.

If he didn’t invade Crimea weak though the sanctions are he would likely have been able to mass produce the t-14 and other new vehicles. As the 2014 sanctions on technology stymied this. And the 2022 ones have stopped all tank production.

A strong and prosperous Russia would find Ukraine looking to it more than Europe as they’re similar “brother Slavs”.

And of course there’s the covert factor and propaganda factor if that worked silently in the background too.

Your observation, that eliminating corruption increases the efficiency/power of - both - the military and of ""other [preferable] avenues of approach"" that share the same goal, then you must understand that this goes **both ways** - those other avenues to goals that can conceivably be reached militarily represent a threat/potential of this efficiency/power being translated into direct military force. 

So, while obviously having other options decreases the need for military force, it then also increases it in so far as this power will be viewed as a threat by competing parties (whose existence is implied by the need to maximize efficiency). 

It's the same with Western influence - being in part both result and promise of less corruption, it has provoked a more corrupt actor to military action, and now demands more military investment in turn. 

Furthermore, if you boil corruption down to inefficiency with reaching goals, then different countries might have different sorts of inefficiencies with regard to different goals. In the same manner as typical corruption as you described is a shockingly normal part of Russian society, other normal phenomena like bureaucratic bloat, inflexible order, an authority with not enough democratic checks - or too many of them, decentralization or centralization, could be considered expressions thereof as well, as they'd all ultimately serve whoever were to be taking advantage of them - at the expense of that of the state. 

So from the pov of some cleric in Iran or Afghanistan, for instance, it would seem perfectly sensible to say that it is the moral societal corruption of the West that prevents it to assert its influence in the region with other means than violence. 

The point is, that stating that: a) corruption is an utterly normal part of a society, b) it makes it ineffective c) and therefore aggressive,  comes down to a thinly disguised value judgement of saying in effect: or enemy hates us because he is weak, and he is weak because he hates us. It might very well be partly or fully correct, but ultimately this formulation leads to a circular way of looking at things. 

I'd ask how one would ""empirically verify"" that corruption really correlates with readiness to use military force, as plausible as it might seem. A crude way might involve looking at countries' military spending as a percentage of gdp. This would imo indicate that each country's unique situation seems by far more deciding. Like, are Brazil and Italy equally corrupt, is Saudi Arabia really that much more corrupt than everyone else, or China - that much less? etc. 

And I don't think one would readily make the claim ""If they were less corrupt, they wouldn't need to be militarily aggressive!"" in conflicts/tensions such as between Azerbaijan and Armenia, or Lebanon and Israel for instance, and there certainly seem to be historical examples of military effectiveness being the very impetus for reforming corrupt structures - and thus the result thereof.

The concept and idea of Taiwan being distinct from China has been around hundreds of years... the problem was during the 40 years of White Terror/martial law period, it was illegal in Taiwan to make such statements or advocate for a non-Chinese identity. You would literally get arrested or killed for making such statements.

Prior to martial law, such concepts were heavily discussed during the Taiwanese nativist literature movement from the 1920's. The 1946 novel [Orphan of Asia by Wu Chuo-liu](https://toolkit.culture.tw/en/literatureinfo_79_170.html) is also one of many perfect examples of this: 

&gt;""The Orphan of Asia examines the issue of colonial identity – a controversial theme that challenged Wu’s readers to ask themselves: Am I Chinese, Japanese, or Taiwanese?

A lucky hit prevents the Russians from ever really using that pier again and significantly hamper any future port operations.

It would not be that hard for China to severely hurt if not permanently end cargo operations in Taiwan's western ports, you wouldn't even need boats, you could just get the PLARF to huck a couple dozen cruise missiles from the mainland to do so.

I hear this a lot, and I believe this may come from an Ian Easton book, but are there any actual studies that demonstrate if this is actually true? If Taiwan believes this, surely then these specific beaches would be heavily fortified and the other unsuitable beaches unfortified, right? 

&gt;And those beaches have had over a half-century of Taiwanese fortification.

Simply sitting back and fortifying isn't sufficient if the defensive strategy does not evolve with the evolution of technology and strategy. The mere existence of the Taiwanese armed forces on the island does not guarantee anything, no more or less than the statement that ""China has been preparing to invade for 70 years!"" tell us anything either. For example, a naval fortress that may have been sufficient in the late 1890s would fall quickly to the firepower of super dreadnaughts from the 1910s.

&gt;And even if a beachhead could be established, China would have to maintain a massive overseas supply chain--a logistical nightmare, especially for a military that has zero large scale combat experience.

I'd expect that the overseas supply chain would probably involve either the capture of civilian harbor facilities and/or ad hoc harbors. While it's true that China has no large scale military experience, Taiwan has even less.

&gt; Any invasion would be greeted with massive amounts of precision artillery, infantry, American trained Special Forces, Apache Helicopters, and intelligence coming from one of the most advanced land-based radar systems on the planet. 

This would happen if China did absolutely zero preparation, abandoned all common sense and simply sent off their landing craft with zero preparation. Against air superiority I have to wonder how much of the defenses, especially vehicles, are survivable.

Bringing supplies from Suao or the other Western ports would be rough sledding, considering China would likely target rail and road routes with precision strikes if it were a full-scale invasion, or sabotage as a prelude to a blockade. 

Commercial planes flying into Taiwan in a combat scenario would surely be a no-go, and probably the only way Taiwan is resupplied from the outside would be from military naval vessels--something would be outside their normal responsibilities.  A silver lining to this is that this isn't 1941--a large-scale Chinese military action would not go unnoticed, and Taiwan and its allies would have several weeks to see a buildup and put into motion plans for stockpiling and attempting to figure out potential re-supply plans.

Each Type 075 LHD has two of those launchers, as well as a further two 30 mm CIWS.

Taiwan would run out of AShMs before the Chinese would run out of interceptors.

&gt;How would China know where they are?

Satellites? AWACS? Drones? SIGINT? HUMINT?

China would be unlikely to begin the amphibious assault unless and until Taiwanese defenses have been severely attrited by a large-scale missile and air campaign.

&gt;In that case they're even more screwed. American AWACs will provide whatever intel is needed, and now you've given America a reason to unleash hell on China.

They were never really held in the same esteem as the empires of the west.
The ottoman empire was a constant target for Russia, they were keen to expand into the balkans.
The ottomans survived as long as they did, because because Britain and France acted to preserve them. If they fell, many other states would try to seize their lands. One of the main contenders being Russia. They preffered keeping the weakened empire alive to prevent a stronger empire emerging. 

[the crimea war is a good example of this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War#:~:text=The%20Crimean%20War%20was%20a,part%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire.)
Russia would wage further wars with the ottomans, however they were prevented from making huge territorial gains in these wars, by the western European States.

Prior to that they also forced the ottomans to recognise Russia as the protector of the orthodox faith, which they sought to use to gain authority over large swathes of territory. 

Their expansion to the east, and into the fringes of China /caucasus was largely dictated by their lack of success in moving west. While they have been a large empire for much of their history, I wouldn't say they were ever one of the great powers until post ww2. They were generally out matched when denied the home advantage, their navy was notoriously bad, and logistics only became more problematic the further west they went.

So historically yes, russia had wanted to achieve some level of hegemony in the east of Europe. They had some successes in the baltic States against Sweden, and also in the partition of Poland, however their main target were the ottomans as they were the only state within Europe that they could confidently go toe to toe with. Their main target were the balkan territories, as they were not controlled by the great European powers, and would give them some much desired warm water ports. Ultimately they would never manage to achieve these goals, and so switched focus elsewhere. 

The devastation caused by ww2 gave them their first real opportunity to make significant gains, at which point they were able to gain great power status.",a5d0e590ae56a5a474ea52f11d4b42be14f72888,True,False,,,,,0,1648435025,,0,{},i2e3170,False,t3_tplpwn,False,True,t3_tplpwn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tplpwn/historically_has_russia_always_wanted_control/i2e3170/,1648435037,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648406225.0,

Not really, it's much easier for a missile to hit a ship than to hit another missile.

And even if you have destroyers firing super accurate missiles that can shoot down other missiles, they're going to eventually run out. And then what? You can fire misssiles from the mainland, they wouldn't get there in time.

That's *not* what happened. 

The rough sequence of events leading to the war in Poland was this: 

1. Nazi Germany issues an ultimatum to Poland demanding Danzig; a plebiscite on the fate of the Polish Corridor heavily weighted by design towards giving the Nazis the corridor; a population exchange in Danzig and the Polish Corridor; and agreed to accept an international guarantee of Poland's future independence.
2. The British Cabinet looked at these demands, and thought them entirely reasonable. They had one small hang-up around the fact the Nazis had demanded that the Poles sign the proposed treaty the next day in full day. Thus satisfied, the British pressured the Poles to start negotiations which given the nature of the ultimatum amounted to blindly accepting the deal. 
3. The Polish ambassador to Berlin was thus obliged to turn up the next day to negotiate, lest refusal annoy Britain. The Nazis refused to see the ambassador because he hadn't been authorized by his government to sign the deal. The Nazis then used this as an excuse to start the war. A war, incidentally, which the Nazis had resolved on before they sent the ultimatum out and which was *always* supposed to be rejected. 

So, in short, the British were no less prepared to sell out Poland in 1939 than they had been to sell out Czechoslovakia in 1938. Britain wanted peace above all and figured that Hitler could be placated via Polish territorial concessions. Had the Nazis had sat back, the British would likely have coerced Poland into accepting the loss of Danzig and the Polish Corridor.

The only reason Britain shifted her stance on the matter was because the Nazis invaded Poland and Britain and France had given guarantees to the Polish government that they would defend her independence. These guarantees, incidentally, were meant to make the Nazis going to war against Poland improbable. They were, in no way, *ever* intended to protect Polish territorial integrity -- especially as it related to Danzig or the Polish Corridor. 

tl;dr the British were 100% willing to force Poland to accept the loss of Danzig and the Polish Corridor to avoid war with the Nazis in a repeat of the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia. The Nazis ruined this cunning plan to disembowel Poland for British and French security by invading Poland.

	The scene seemed more suited to an Austin Powers spy farce than a John le Carré cold war intrigue.

“I told Moscow that you are such a good boy,” lieutenant colonel Sergey Solomasov, a spook working for Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency, told his Slovak contact, Bohus Garbar. “Moscow decided that you’ll be a hunter.” 

But Solomasov — on paper, Russia’s deputy military attaché in Bratislava — was wrong. Garbar did not get a chance to hunt. Instead he was the hunted: Slovak agents had filmed the meeting with his handler.

On March 14, Solomasov was one of three Russians expelled from Slovakia “for acting in contravention of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations”. Though Garbar — a well-connected, muckraking blogger — was a lowly target, the Russian’s other recruits were not: Solomasov’s network included a Slovak colonel and a senior official in counter-intelligence.

Keeping track of the Kremlin’s espionage activity in the west has become an even more urgent task since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended Europe’s security order. But many countries are still playing catch-up with Moscow’s undercover activity on their soil.

“What we know about [it] is almost certainly the tip of the iceberg,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow of the Russia programme at Chatham House. “For many years there has been a conspiracy of silence, with western powers reluctant to talk about Russian activities or even go after them.”

Eight serving European intelligence officials and diplomats interviewed by the Financial Times said Russia’s covert operations in Europe had been expanding at a rate that counter-espionage efforts have struggled to match. Several countries still rely on US and UK intelligence gathering because of restrictions on domestic surveillance and a lack of resources.

A round of expulsions this month points to the scale of the problem. In addition to the Slovak defenestration, three Baltic states and Bulgaria announced expulsions of 20 alleged Russian agents in total. And Poland declared 45 Russian diplomats personae non gratae, alleging all to be using diplomatic cover to undertake intelligence work.

Some countries, such as the UK, are confident they have reduced Russian capacity significantly, with agent numbers in Britain in the low single digits, according to one senior Whitehall official. But other countries are more exposed. Dozens of Russian agents are still active in Germany, France and Belgium, according to the assessment of one European intelligence official.

Austria is a “veritable aircraft carrier” of covert Russian activity, said another. Its BVT intelligence agency is regarded as being so compromised that for a time it was cut out of much European intelligence sharing activity, according to one Vienna-based European diplomat. The country’s defence ministry is “practically a department of the GRU”, the diplomat added.

An Austrian chancellery official said they could not comment on anonymous allegations but pointed out that the current government has been pushing through sweeping reform of its security agencies.

“We are beginning to see governments in Europe start to face up publicly to what is happening,” said Giles. “Democracies can’t defend themselves against threats about which the majority of their population is unaware.” 

Recent cases that have made it into the public domain reveal the scope and scale of Russia’s interests and successes:

2017 Russia had an agent working as a close adviser to the then French minister of defence, now foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s former spy chief Bernard Bajolet said in an interview last year.

July 2020 Danish authorities uncovered Russian attempts to steal energy technology. In August that year, a French lieutenant colonel, working for Nato’s maritime command in Naples, was arrested for passing classified Nato material to the GRU, the Russian intelligence agency. In December, Dutch authorities expelled two Russian undercover agents for trying to steal AI and nanotechnology from Dutch companies.

March 2021 Bulgaria arrested six of its own citizens — including defence ministry employees and former head of defence intelligence Ivan Iliev — for passing secrets to the GRU at a cost of $3,000 each. Iliev and the other accused are remanded in custody awaiting trial. Later that month, Italian authorities caught navy captain Walter Biot selling a series of military secrets to the GRU for $5,000 a time. Biot’s trial opened last week. He has not yet entered a plea.

June 2021 German authorities arrested Russian scientist “Ilnur N” for stealing aeronautical secrets and missile technology from research centres in Augsburg. His trial continues. In September they arrested a security employee of the German parliament, who had sold the GRU detailed blueprints of the building and its systems.

Russia employs around 400,000 people across its three main intelligence agencies. The defence ministry’s “main directorate”, the GU — still widely known by its Soviet-era initials as the GRU — has wide-ranging interests in Nato affairs and military technology, as well as in subversion and sabotage.

The FSB is focused on domestic intelligence but its “fifth service” collects foreign intelligence from Russia’s near-abroad — including Ukraine. The SVR, the inheritor to the KGB’s first chief directorate, is tasked solely with foreign intelligence gathering.

Western officials said there were typically three types of Russian agent at work in Europe: declared agents, often filling roles such as the defence attaché, working for the GRU; undeclared agents, who might be disguised by the SVR as part of a trade delegation; and illegals, who are sleeper agents working deeply undercover.

“There are very few of these. For every 100 that enter the SVR’s ‘S’ directorate [for training “illegals”], only two might graduate,” said one official.

Keeping track of Russia’s covert activity is a huge challenge even when the targets are known.

“You need a very co-ordinated foreign and domestic intelligence operation to try and foil a lot of this activity,” said Gustav Gressel, a Berlin-based Russia analyst at the European Council for Foreign Relations, a think-tank. “A lot of the security bureaucracies in Europe are just not up to this.”

But expulsions, or the destruction of Russian networks, are just one tool that can be wielded. The bigger prizes, said another official, are to persuade agents to switch sides or to deliberately misinform them.

“Offence is often the best defence — especially when things get ugly, as they are now,” said one European security official. “It can be a good time to recruit.”",de2a3d3a4b651f39457618a312d29fc8dc93a750,True,False,,,,,0,1648431604,,0,{},i2dw6hh,False,t3_tpij9z,False,True,t1_i2dv95r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tpij9z/ukraine_megathread_march_27/i2dw6hh/,1648431620,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648402804.0,

Russia's logistics for their land invasion look to be pretty bad, and all they really have to do is drive down some roads that are already there while bringing their own gas and food. To effectively invade Taiwan, China would not only need to have a massive transport fleet to get troops and vehicles there, but also keep that transport fleet running for weeks and months to keep the troops supplied while they fight. And all of those transport ships will be highly vulnerable to anti-shipping missiles pretty much all the time, including while loading up at mainland ports. And every scrap of stuff will have to be moved by truck or train to the right mainland port, loaded onto a ship, sailed across the strait, docked somewhere in Taiwan, and then loaded onto trucks to transport to end-users.

If I was China, I'd build a ton of troop and supply transport ships and do a ton of training and exercises to improve coordination of large-scale movement of supplies in a combat zone.

If I was Taiwan, I'd build a ton of portable anti-shipping missiles and rig them up in hidden underground launchers, only a few per site. Rig up some way to target them from a bunch of small mountainside lookouts. And naturally be ready to blow up all of your actual ports before the PLAN forces can get to them.

And we've also learned that launching an invasion into a semi-modern country with smartphones everywhere leads to a massive number of propaganda videos of blown up civilians and buildings and destroyed enemy military vehicles making it out into the world to generate sympathy.

On that we agree. Ultimately my sympathies lie with Taiwan, whose people overwhelmingly desire to continue along their distinct path.

My point is simply that, ultimately, debates about legitimacy are meaningless. China, with its authoritarian system rooted in part on the righting of historical wrongs, bases its claims on history. Taiwan, which has developed a liberal-democratic identity over its decades of autonomy, bases its claims on the wishes of its citizenry as expressed via democratic processes.

There is also no obvious chain of conquests after Taiwan; Poland was worth declaring war over because everyone knew it wouldn't end there, Germany stated as much. China has said consistently for 70 years that China and Taiwan are one country, and that eventually the civil war would be concluded by reunification whether peaceful or military; it's not a serious position to suggest that because China is willing to use military force against Taiwan, they are therefore going to invade Australia, although I'm sure something like that would be a common talking point in the media following any actual invasion. For what it's worth, I don't think the situation is exactly comparable to something like East and West Germany either, a civil war is a different origin than superpower segregation.

You can read the entire thing for operations up to regiment levels. The basic large-scale, Army BCT equivalence unit seems to be a Littoral Combat Regiment, consisting of an Infantry battalion, an anti-ship missile battalion, and an anti-air missile battalion, plus a logistic and sustainment battalion. They will probably plonk down on each rock and shoal a company of each as advanced bases.

The part you are interested in is in the Appendix A-7, 2030 Infantry battalion.

The Infantry battalion will lose the the Scout Sniper platoon, Heavy MG Platoon, TOW platoon in the weapons company and the 60 mm mortar section in the weapons platoon. In return, MAAWs are everywhere, Javelins and 81 mm mortars are pushed down to company levels. Instead of the typical 3 lights/lines + 1 heavy, the 2030 Marine infantry battalions will have 3 homogenous companies.

The Infantry companies will lose the 60 mm mortar section in the weapons platoon. In the table, though, there's no .50 cal MGs. There's 81 mm mortars, Javelins and MAAWS and M240s. There's also the Organic Precision Fires-Infantry, which is a loitering munition, at company level.

Throughout the course of a 2010 investigation by ProPublica, Paul Steiger, the then editor in chief of the publication said that ""those who spearheaded creation of NED have long acknowledged it was part of an effort to move from covert to overt efforts to foster democracy"" and cited as evidence a 1991 interview in which then-NED president Allen Weinstein said, ""A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.""

It matters to China.

&gt;It was lost.

And regained in 1945.

&gt;Taiwan was also not part of China from 1945 to 1949. That is totally false.

[Chen Yi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yi_(Kuomintang)) would be surprised. You are correct that it wasn't internationally recognized as part of China until 1952, but practically speaking, it was reintegrated in [October 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocession_Day).

&gt;So now China's claims to legal control over territory hinge on convenient readings of treaties being ""unfair"" (too bad), the Mandate of Heaven, and an incorrect assumption that Taiwan was returned to China in 1945.

This makes them more dangerous, not less. If they think they won't be able to stop a coming NATO ground offensive conventionally, why shouldn't they escalate to nuclear?

That's also why it's a bad strategic move for us. Intervention boosts Russian morale and will as they could then frame themselves as fighting back against the big bad west that always had it out for them, and gives them a bunch more targets to attack. This half-assed invasion is a disaster and morale drain for Russia. It makes their military and leadership look incompetent, costs huge casualties. Russian people will ask, why do we need a massive mobilization to conquer and pacify our Ukrainian cousins? And there's no good answer to that. The better move is to let Ukraine bleed Russia dry while their citizens ask why the hell are we doing this and why the hell is it costing so much.

It kind of sucks for Ukraine to do that. But then fighting a large-scale WWIII on Ukrainian soil, that might possibly escalate to nuclear, isn't exactly good for Ukraine either.
