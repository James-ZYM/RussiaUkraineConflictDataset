You can't go wrong with either, but they feed into different agencies/bureaus.

**Georgetown Strengths**

* MSFS is the Foreign Service school, so has very strong relationships with the State Department, USAID, UN, etc. Anything related to active diplomacy is more Georgetown's bailiwick. If you want to be a diplomat, Georgetown is a better bet. Also, as the first School of Foreign Service, I'd say it has more lay elite prestige.
* MSFS is ranked #1. SAIS is ranked #2 for IR (and #3 when incl. Public Policy, just behind Harvard). The distinction is very small, but the prestige boost is there.
* Georgetown's student body has more of a ""social justice"" bent, since Georgetown as a university is more activist and woke (not said as a pejorative). So if you want a strong community and the benefits of a wider university, Georgetown is better. SAIS - by virtue of being completely separated from Baltimore - doesn't have those university ties. If you're in Bologna or Nanjing, those campuses are *extremely* tight knit. But SAIS DC does feel a bit ""out on its own.""
* I would say Latin America and Africa are much better programs at Georgetown. Asian Studies is probably also better at Georgetown (with China a notable exception). Europe is about even, though Georgetown's program is very German-centric, whereas the SAIS Europe program is a more historical (Cold War, EU Institutions), hence why Anne Applebaum, Yascha Mounk are both professors at SAIS).

**SAIS Strengths**

* SAIS is the realist/quant/econ school. It has very strong ties to the defense industry, financial consulting, banks, etc. Both IMF and the World Bank have lots of SAIS grads. I've also come across a lot of DOD SAIS grads as well. For White House staffers, the big 3 most represented are definitely Harvard/Princeton/SAIS, with Georgetown surprisingly distant (you see more Duke, Syracuse grads even). So if you want to do anything defense-related, financial, or 
* SAIS tends to be a bit more conservative than the other schools. It's definitely a realist school at heart (Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs, Zbigniew Brzezinski taught there), so you get more military types, more great power politic type of conversations. This can be good/bad, but I think it's definitely seen by employers as a more level-headed skill set than schools like American SIS (which has a reputation for being way too soft and 'kumbaya' in its teaching approach)
* China - SAIS has a crazy strong connection with China. As a result of the Hopkins–Nanjing Center, there's a strong awareness of SAIS. The former Chinese Minister of Commerce went to SAIS, Nicholas Burns (current US Ambassador to China) is a SAIS grad, Cui Tiankai (Chinese Ambassador to the USA from 2013-2021) is a SAIS grad, etc.
* Johns Hopkins is a Top 10 national university, and even a Top 10 global university according to U.S. News ([https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings)). While SFS has more prestige/rank than SAIS, Hopkins has more cachet than Georgetown. From a ""university momentum,"" Hopkins has really stepped up its visibility in recent years. The Webb Space Telescope is commandeered by Hopkins (in Baltimore), the infamous COVID-19 dashboard meant that Johns Hopkins' name was plastered on every CNN/Fox News/NBC/ABC/CBS chyron for the past 2 years, Michael Bloomberg seems to give the university hundreds of millions (if not billions) every few years - which creates a new round of expansion. From a ""ROI"" perspective, I think Hopkins has a better trajectory than Georgetown. Even SAIS has benefited, since the new SAIS campus is smack-dab between the White House and U.S. Capitol ([https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/29/deal-closes-for-555-pennsylvania-ave-purchase/](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/29/deal-closes-for-555-pennsylvania-ave-purchase/)), which should further increase its visibility and prestige.

&amp;#x200B;

**Applies to Both**

* Strategic Studies - both are great
* International Development - both are great, though I've heard Kennedy School is the Holy Grail.
* Both are extremely expensive
* Neither is an MBA and neither will be seen as a substitute for an MBA. You can definitely do business-related consulting with both, but there's definitely a wall where you'll be expected to get an MBA.
* I think both are very theoretical and academic, whereas most of the real world employers want skills/experience in ""uncool"" topics like management, human capital, IT, financial accounting, logistics. I think neither SAIS nor SFS are really good at giving you those 'leadership' skills that you might see more in an MPA program, so you might have to build those separately later.

First, if you're in finance, I'd recommend that you lateral over to S&amp;T (if you're not there already), specifically in a rates desk to start to get some experience on the kinds of push and pull factors that governments care about and how policy works. This kind of thing would be helpful in building up the kind of knowledge an IR master's has without the opp cost that grad school represents.

If you want to go to IR straightaway, I would highly recommend political economy as a general starting field. I worked in it during undergrad and before I joined finance. If you worked in S&amp;T, lots of knowledge overlap. Several of my colleagues at the uni thinktank/lab I worked at have since become analysts at places like the Rhodium Group (they have a strong US-China econ group if you're interested) and other IR advisory/thinktanks.

Alternatively, consider working in policy. I worked at an UNRCO and some of my friends still work there. Great opportunity if you can get it (or any UN agency that requires an economist). While jobs are hard to get, having a nice monetary cushion from your time in finance helps.

Honestly, finance experience drives most people into something related to econ which I've really enjoyed. However, it's totally possible to do some IR thing non-econ related, you'll just probably have little advantage compared to your average MIA.",7500e90c96b227c7d42f83ff124026584f0d58ce,True,False,,,,,0,1648495216,,0,{},i2h2r2x,False,t3_tqaqxt,False,True,t1_i2glbj1,/r/geopolitics/comments/tqaqxt/johns_hopkins_sais_vs_georgetown_msfs/i2h2r2x/,1648495226,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648466416.0,

Turkey generally opposes Russian influence in Syria, and Turkey and Russia are both competing for influence over the southern Caucus areas with Azerbaijan and Armenia. For Russia and Turkey to get along in Syria, Turkey would have to return the land they're currently occupying to Syria, and Syria would likely immediately expel all the Kurds living there back into Turkey.   


Azerbaijan is a close Turkish Ally and Turkey will come to aid if they're attacked. Azerbaijan and Armenia, like Ukraine, are former Soviet Countries, and Russia would like to re-establish Russian influence over the Areas, as Turkey seeks to as well.   


Turkey is also a regional rival of Iran, and the two compete through funding various militias to fight each-other.   


After Russia mediated the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan to one that generally favors Azerbaijan and Turkey, I thought that there might be a chance that Turkey and Russia were attempting to resolve disputes to move towards a more cordial relationship, but as soon as the conflict stalled, the Azerbaijan Army immediately started drilling and wargames on their southern border with Iran. On the other side of that border is a large Azeri minority that extends well into Tehran.   


For Russia and Turkey to become allies, they would have to resolve their overlapping goals all over the middle east and Africa, as well as dealing with sanctions when the Turkish Lira is already weak and Turkey is somewhat reliant on Spanish and American investment dollars.   


In terms of what Turkey has to gain from Russia? I can't see much. Turkey has a better chance leveraging it's important position in NATO to make gains with Greek disputes than it does fighting all of NATO to take Greek islands or supporting Northern Cyprus. 

From my point of view, Turkey is ""Playing both sides"" without making any commitments to Russia, and right now they're getting mostly everything they're looking for geopolitically from both sides. (The UK's new map of Cyprus is a minor but significant example). Turkey doesn't have very much to gain from betraying Nato, but they have quite a lot to lose.   


Russia would LOVE for Turkey to flip against NATO, just as they sought to break the UK apart from the EU, but if they can't fund it like they did Brexit, then it's very unlikely to happen from within Turkey.",8b0a3dc4c9c77bcf58edca991a7aeea396c3f357,True,False,,,,,0,1648495180,,0,{},i2h2o0o,False,t3_tqgej6,False,True,t3_tqgej6,/r/geopolitics/comments/tqgej6/russia_turkish_alliance_incoming_libya/i2h2o0o/,1648495193,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648466380.0,

The “woke crowd” wants the state to push their views. They want the state to intervene on every layer of society to fight perceived discrimination, to impose gender and racial quotas, to lift the poor up and push the rich down, to redistribute wealth and opportunities, to force parity, to educate children with the state's values rather than the child's family's...

That is very, very much against the core principles of libertarianism, which is pull yourself up by your bootstraps without the government intervening to fix your life like a nanny state.

The rest of your comment just reads like US nationalistic propaganda.

&gt;What’s magical about liberal democracies is that as long as there’s one American left, there’s an America.

Well, but the world isn't the United States. There's more liberal democracies out there. And not all of them have the glue of nationalism sticking the whole country together like the US does. Take for instance Belgium, where people identify as Walloons or Flemish rather than Belgians, or the UK, where most people are Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish or English rather than just British. Or Spain, where all the peripheral regions have strong regionalistic/secessionist parties who keep sabotaging central governance appealing to their own nationhood. And I think Italy and Germany both also have many people with allegiance to their region but less so the country. 

It is actually a disadvantage of liberal democracies against authoritarian regimes. People in authoritarian regimes who are exposed every single day of their lives to nationalistic propaganda are more willing to fight for their country, even if what they're actually fighting for is the elites' status quo and their lives are generally not that good.

Liberal democracies (of which, I remind you, the United States isn't the single, exclusive example) allow for more freedom of thought, and people are even allowed to publicly hate the country they live in and criticize it harshly (generally not possible under authoritarian regimes). There's more freedom to explore different identities than the ones marked by the state. And life is generally better, so people are less willing to risk it fighting for what they're more likely to know  is the elite's privileges.",91a6c48c7f4786396542fc551144a770a84d08c8,True,False,,,,,0,1648494148,,0,{},i2h06yh,False,t3_tpvwj2,False,True,t1_i2fd95a,/r/geopolitics/comments/tpvwj2/ukraines_threetoone_advantage_what_foreign/i2h06yh/,1648494161,1,True,False,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648465348.0,

However, the western powers fumbled the bag and instead of lending a supporting hand, continued to exploit all these countries and the power dynamics to make sure they get the cheapest natural resources and labour (my observation has been that the prosperity in the West comes at the cost of the prosperity of the people in the East. you need cheap labour to make affordable clothes and technology and if the quality of life in this region increases, so will the cost of your everyday items).

But  on the other hand enemies don’t re-affirm nations beliefs to the extent they will solely make alliances with nations with like minded values. 

During the Cold War and even today, Republicans and Democrats held hawkish positions against the USSR and now China. JFK telephoned Dwight Eisenhower during Cuban Crisis, while Biden has continued Trump’s antagonism toward China. In both eras, an emphasis on protecting freedom and democracy was emphasized. 

But at the same time US and its rivals built alliances with nations not to spread their own respective philosophies, but to prevent the other from doing the same. The US made alliances with socialist dictatorships like Yugoslavia, and the USSR aligned itself with democracies like India. A recent non-American example of this is in the Middle East, Israel, a long time the enemy of virtually every Arab nation, managed to not only form alliances but be recognized by the likes of the UAE and Bahrain, all in the name of uniting against Iran. Israel is a Jewish ethnostate with a democratic system, while its neighbors are autocratic islamic kingdoms or military dictatorships. 

If the world is to split between the US, NATO and China,I doubt we will see an ideological alliance exclusively consisting democracies pitting against authoritarian regimes.

Voting blocs could probably give weaker regions more 'power' vs the bigger players too.

[],False,,Alphakarp,,,[],,,,text,t2_139rpm,False,False,"First of all, your analysis is just wrong. I gave two very clear-cut examples of direct American involvement: the Vietnam and Iraq wars, which killed 2.5 million and 650,000 people, respectively. Remind me, who dropped Agent Orange on civilians, exactly? America is also directly involved in blockading Yemen, which has led directly to one of the greatest humanitarian disasters since the Cold War, alongside Saudi involvement.  
Nor do I really see why ""working with"" inhumanly cruel groups is much better than killing people directly. If I gave a gun to a school shooter, knowing exactly what they were planning to do, and fed him information about the locations of fleeing school children, I would be considered an accomplice and held criminally responsible by any sane court. The genocidal acts committed in East Timor and Guatemala were only possible through American financing and backing- these weren't just embarrassing incidents where America continued trading with these countries, America was about as involved as they could be, short of dropping bombs themselves.   
America explicitly assured Indonesia prior to the invasion that they wouldn't oppose it, and indeed worked with the press to manipulate the public opinion. Through 25 years of deplorable occupation which was condemned the world over, the US provided Indonesia with $1.1 billion in weapons, and trained their special forces in urban guerrilla warfare, surveillance, counter-intelligence, sniper tactics and psychological operations. The official UN inquiry into the matter concluded that American ""political and military support were fundamental to the Indonesian invasion and occupation"". There is even some evidence suggesting limited direct involvement by US personnel. This wasn't working with Stalin in WW2, or turning a blind eye to Franco's Spain. This was directly assisting in an ongoing crime against humanity which claimed up to 200,000 lives, one-fith of East Timor's entire population. If America had refused to support the invasion from the start, their ally Indonesia would probably not have had the courage to face down universal condemnation by the international community in doing so. As it stands, they were murdering East Timorese children with American-made guns, held by troops trained by America, relying upon American intel and money. America was fully aware of the extreme violence being used against peaceful people throughout, and had decades to stop facilitating crimes against humanity. This isn't just Cold War-era ancient history, either- it continued until **1999**.

You cannot handwave aiding and abetting genocide by calling it ""realpolitik"". East Timor was a tiny, strategically unimportant nation which posed no threat to anybody.

  
You're also ignoring that many of these tyrannical governments exist because of America in the first place. Who exactly destroyed Iran's first and last ever democracy in 1953? Or erected brutal dictatorships in South America because the people elected governments which often amounted to little more than Social Democracies? There's a difference between reluctantly cooperating with an unsavoury government and intentionally installing one yourself.  
You're correct in thinking I have no love for America, just as I hold pretty every large empire throughout history in contempt. Whether it's the British, imperial Japan, China, the USSR, or America, the fundamental nature of them has never changed. They are inherently megalomaniacal and indifferent to human life, willing to do whatever it takes to exert total control over any territory which will let them. America has a better PR game than others- they prefer not to massacre civilians themselves- and I'll even concede that they're one of the better empires in history, but that doesn't make them good. The fact that every other major power also bankrolls or participates in atrocities is hardly a compelling excuse.  
It isn't a big surprise that former colonial powers often benefit from American hegemony. Contrary to the characterisation of Europeans as lily-livered pacifists here, Europe is totally complicit in all of this. But we should ideally do what is best for humanity, not just for us. If American activities happen to align with that, we should support them, and the same goes for China or Russia. If, however, they are purely intended to extend their own hegemony at the cost of human lives, I see no reason to.",bea6e8a0dfbeffb2d60ce02d32e2cb15070123d9,True,False,,,,,0,1648470559,,0,{},i2fhkp4,False,t3_th0p2b,False,True,t1_i2dwms1,/r/geopolitics/comments/th0p2b/understanding_germanys_foreign_policy/i2fhkp4/,1648470576,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648441759.0,

[],False,,Cuddlyaxe,,,[],,,,text,t2_ftpsl,False,True,"Officially all the UNSC members explicitly support India's membership except China, which makes some sense as India has good relations with the US, the UK, France and Russia

China has in the past said they would support India's membership in the UNSC conditional on India dropping support for Japan's bid to the UNSC. Quite honestly though I doubt that this is genuine and is rather a ploy to create divisions between India and Japan, 

So yeah, the main obstacle to India becoming a UNSC member is China, not the West. 

As for whether Indian UNSC membership would be good for the West or not, that depends. As the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown, India has an independent foreign policy. It wouldn't be a guaranteed vote for the Western bloc like Germany or Japan would be. It also wouldn't be in a anti Western bloc with China and Russia though. It'd be a sort of wildcard honestly

But do the West really want India in the UNSC? My general thoughts are that there's probably some opposition in Western diplomatic circles behind closed doors: empowering India would provide a new anti China voice in the UNSC, but at the same time India isn't a guaranteed vote for the Western agenda and would therefore reduce the relative power of the existing members of the UN. India would add yet another country that could veto resolutions which the West may like after all;

all this being said though, I expect the West to keep supporting an Indian bid for the UNSC if nothing else because words are cheap and improve relations with India. I doubt they'd do much to block India from UNSC membership either but they will be content to not push it and let the issue live on the sidelines

All this raises an interesting conundrum though: Indian, unlike I'd argue Japan or Germany, is growing pretty quickly and has the capability to establish itself as a true ""superpower"", even if such a prospect is a long way off

At that point India will have much more power and is unlikely to acquiesce to not being treated as an equal in the UNSC.

1. You're assuming Indian desire to be neutral has to do with Russian veto ability. That will have to be proven. US/France has vetoed recent Indian issues.
2. West cannot alone put a country as permanent member. China is the one blocking UNSC expansion in the grounds of ""technical"" issues and needing ""package"" solutions.

The thing is, UNSC expansion is a pipe dream until and unless China decides to not block it. The 4 contenders for UNSC perm seat are India, Japan, Germany, and Brazil.

At least 3 of which, China has a problem. 

India (and Japan even) had the idea that being close to Russia would help contain its relation with China. Obviously that failed.

Indian policy makers in 2017 has made it clear that they're going with the US for the long term. Not directly word-for-word. But feel free to check to military import graph. Who India is seeking FTA + allow investors from. India has blocked Chinese investors while unblocking western ones.

Indian neutrality in my opinion has more to do with Russian military dependence. India still needs Russian spare parts. And Russia is so far the only country willing to lease nuclear subs and aircraft carriers. 

India calls it multi-alignment to purchase military goods from US/Europe/Israel. But reality is, India is working on reducing Russian dependence for the last 5 years. Not that it was very successful.

I don't really know what you mean by this, so my guess is no. 

&gt; However, most countries that use conscription are marginally to fully autocratic states

While this may be true, it doesn't follow that only those countries can/should use conscription. Conscription is a perfectly valid strategy where a country has a serious, larger threat nearby. Finland, for example, could never have a credible defense with a professional military (without spending crazy amounts, like 10% of the GDP, on defense). The country is just too big to defend with 2-3 divisions. Even Israel, which has almost 30x as high population density and a ton of direct US military aid, uses conscription, while having arguably a bit less aggressive neighbors (let's be honest, Russia/Soviet Union is hard to beat when it comes to direct aggression).

Let's remember that Austria and Switzerland also have broad conscription, and Norway, Sweden and some of the Baltic states have narrower ones. What's the common nominator here? Is is that they are all autocratic countries? No, it's Russia. Of course if you are surrounded by friendlies and don't actually need a credible defense of your own (e.g. your defense is guaranteed by the US or NATO) then of course you can get away with a small professional military. Similarly, if you are a huge country with no peer adversaries anywhere near (e.g. the US), then of course you also can get away with a small military.",4022e9cab594bfc6ccf3b0f4ca1d3ceffc8b2ce9,True,False,,,,,0,1648445126,,0,{},i2ekvg9,False,t3_tpvwj2,False,True,t1_i2ecolk,/r/geopolitics/comments/tpvwj2/ukraines_threetoone_advantage_what_foreign/i2ekvg9/,1648445137,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648416326.0,

[],False,,EqualContact,,,[],,,,text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,"That's the problem though—it is *very* hard to be strong on both land and sea. It's usually only something that a ""hyperpower"" can actually accomplish. Some of the great empires in history have done it (Rome, Ottomans), but I would argue that often times nations have to chose which to pour their wealth into. 

Britain decided to focus on its navy, and this made them dominant on the sea, but usually their army was small and performed poorly, though adequately. No British war of the modern era began without 1 or 2 ignominious defeats of their army. The British in WWI were depending on France to provide the bulk of the army, while they provided the bulk of the navy.

France always struggled with this questions, but could pretty much never match Britain at sea because they needed to invest so heavily in their continental army. The Entente was so effective because it allowed both powers to focus on what they were good at rather than trying to be strong in a way that they were not suited for. The British of course eventually put a very large army on the battlefield, but they were top power of the world at the time.

The US has managed to do both from the 1940s onward, but the US is essentially an ascendent hyperpower that dominants the world through both soft and hard power. As China rises, it might become impractical for the US to continue supporting sea and land forces so heavily.

Anyways, I don't think in either war Germany could have invested more in their navy without hurting their army. The High Seas Fleet was hypothetically equal to the Grand Fleet, but I have a lot of doubt that Germany could have come out on to in a pitch battle. The most they could have hoped for was for both fleets to annihilate each other, which might have hurt Britain longterm, but still wasn't going to win Germany the war, which is why they never tried again after Jutland.

So it ended up being largely meaningless, while the fate of the war was ultimately decided in France. Honestly though, in both cases Germany just had too many enemies. The US entry to WWI meant they were doomed, and then in WWII the failure to defeat the USSR and the US involvement meant that Germany simply didn't have the economy to win.",55b9a24b49efcfac0ea2e39aa0bc93c220a2b38c,True,False,,,,,0,1648443605,,0,{},i2eiiqv,False,t3_tpvwj2,False,True,t1_i2egb52,/r/geopolitics/comments/tpvwj2/ukraines_threetoone_advantage_what_foreign/i2eiiqv/,1648443622,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648414805.0,

[],False,,Thalesian,,,[],,,,text,t2_9a2zp,False,False,"Submission Statement: I think it is time to revisit this incident from late 2021 in light of recent events:

&gt; On 15 November, Russia conducted a direct-ascent anti-satellite (DA-ASAT) test, destroying one of its own space objects, a defunct satellite, in low-earth orbit. The test captured international attention and was quickly and widely condemned as threatening and irresponsible—not least for the cloud of lethal, uncontrollable debris it created, which will endanger both space assets and human spaceflight for years to come.

Further details about what systems beyond the international space station (ISS) have not been forthcoming, but it is reasonable to suspect that this act may have been aggressive in nature, and not simply a test. Regardless of whether or not this was the first military engagement in space, it is worth considering what space warfare could be, and what actions and responses are needed by the international community. 

It is certainly conceivable that if you have a specific satellite or satellite system in mind, there is tactical advantage to disabling them by creating space junk (an example could be a system capable of monitoring your army’s movements). But unlike an artillery round or precision guided missile, the after effects of space junk can persist for millennia, creating practically permanent problems with both space transportation and orbiting systems. The dispersal of debris prevents erosion, but the speed of debris never slows down. It is for all intents and purposes, a permanent shrapnel explosion. There is no undo button in Earth’s orbit. A region affected can never be un-affected, at least not with [any currently comprehensible technology](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-junk-removal-is-not-going-smoothly/?amp=true).

Another key concern is proportional response. Any response in kind will amplify the dangers of space junk. Any responsible nation with an interest in any satellite presence would need to unilaterally oppose this type of warfare. 

The last clear concern to raise is the [Kessler Syndrome](https://www.space.com/kessler-syndrome-space-debris), in which space junk creates more space junk through increasing collisions. 

&gt; The Kessler Syndrome describes, and warns of, a cascade of orbital debris that could potentially hinder humanity's space ambitions and activities down the road.

It is distinctly possible that without a robust international system of laws, the first serious military conflict in space could permanently limit space travel ambitions, both manned and unmanned, scientific or otherwise.

You may also consider reading Joll ""Origins of World War I"" after ""The Guns of August"". A.J.P. Taylor ""The Origins of World War II"" is a controversial book.
