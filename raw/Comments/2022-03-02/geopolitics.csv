[""What If Russia Wins?"" -- Same website](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-02-18/what-if-russia-wins):

&gt;As the crisis in Ukraine unfolds, the West must not underestimate Russia. It must not bank on narratives inspired by wishful thinking. Russian victory in Ukraine is not science fiction.

The overall piece makes the exact argument you claim ""no outlet would publish"", including that NATO membership costs might be higher and Putin may succeed and strengthen.

I found that in two clicks on the same website as the original outlet. It's admittedly pre-war, but that doesn't change the point. Trying to pretend media is all one-sided about this would be incorrect.

Here is [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/putin-has-never-lost-war-here-how-hell-win-ukraine-1682878.html) publishing an op-ed:

&gt;If events play out as military analysts now expect, the conflict will end relatively quickly with a negotiated settlement that may cede some territory to Russia, the installation of a new Russia-friendly regime in Kyiv and a partial withdrawal of troops that allows Putin to avoid the quagmire the West so badly wants him sucked into. In doing so, Putin will be able to claim that he dealt a devastating setback to NATO, the main goal of his aggression.

Here's [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/russian-military-power-weakness-ukraine/623323/):

&gt;This is not a movie. There is no script that gives the underdog the victory in the end. NATO’s renewed solidarity is of limited benefit to Ukrainians under fire in Kyiv. Germany’s increased defense budget does absolutely nothing to destroy the miles-long Russian armored convoys now inching down Ukrainian roads.

&gt;The West has woken up. NATO is united. Russia has already been made to pay for its aggression. But its army is still in Ukraine, grabbing more territory every day. It may learn from its mistakes, growing more aggressive to both destroy the Ukrainian resistance and deter additional foreign interference in the fight. If Russia does ultimately break Ukraine, the first flush of hope is likely to be forgotten amid the ashes of defeat.

Yes, this will damage much of the world. This doesn't make Russia some sort of power to be reckoned with. Lebanon will be hit by grain shortages on top of its existing food crisis as Russian tanks tear up eastern Ukraine's fields (where 17.5% of the population's daily food is grown). I expect we will see a new Arab (and Global) Spring as a result of the carnage this unleashes on costs-of-living. 

Russia will of course find ways to circumvent the sanctions, but it's largest banks are collapsing (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/02/28/russias-sberbank-plunges-amid-warnings-collapse/), and its stock market remains closed yet again in an attempt to mitigate the catastrophic impact. While brent crude prices absolutely are spiking, Russian markets are unable to shift the county's prestige crude at $20 a barrel (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/business/energy-environment/russia-oil-price.html). 

China probably will buy up the excess capacity, and Russia (a country with a pre-war economy the size of Italy's) will need this income dramatically now that it is cut off from its largest trading partner (https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/russia/). Speaking of China, isn't it interesting how the Chinese Yuan is now being accepted to pay bills in Russia? That would suggest a currency crisis and have implications for China's growing influence over Russia's Far East. (https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/sanctions-target-russia-fesco-says-customers-can-pay-yuan-2022-03-02/).

Russia probably will win the conventional war (a dramatic departure from my assessment 7 days ago, when it was a near certainty), but the subsequent insurgency will almost certainly bleed them over the coming years. They have already announced 500 casualties. The Ukrainians claim 6000. Both claims are likely to be wildly exaggerated in their favour. UK Military intelligence's estimate is 4000. Ignoring that, and just going by the Russian claims, they have sustained 3.3% of the casualties in 7 days that they sustained in 9 years of war in Afghanistan. The documented equipment losses are already at around year 5 of the war (https://twitter.com/oryxspioenkop). The paper tiger has met the garden hose: Russian military strength is simply not what we imagined. 70% percent of the entire Russian army is now committed to this war, so Russia's posturing on the Nordic borders is questionable, and the Far East of the country is looking incredibly vulnerable. The deployment of a handful of hand picked troops to a COIN-centric conflict zone does not correspond with large scale conventional warfare, as the 100,000 troops (80% of the invasion force) now either hungry or running short of food and ammo are learning. (https://www.newsweek.com/russian-troops-grapple-shortages-food-fuel-morale-ukraine-1683793)

Lavrov's severing of diplomatic ties is far from an act of strength, and more likely the realisation that few want to listen to him (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/dozens-of-diplomats-walk-out-on-lavrovs-un-speech).

I don't disagree with your fundamental argument: I have long believed that the world's economies are balkanizing (a great read on this is ""Bloc by Bloc"" by Steven Weber), but a pariah state Russia with a collapsing economy and a military that is something of a laughing stock (see /r/NonCredibleDefense for the latest on the VDV's credibility) is not going to shape any of these blocs. If they can catch a ride with China, then that might keep them afloat a little longer, but the price will be high (https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/why-china-will-reclaim-siberia)",10dd18e436407f9bcbb04c6e3fbee77028ef3bcc,True,False,,,,,0,1646259561,,0,{},hz3vpty,True,t3_t495kh,False,True,t1_hz1p3pc,/r/geopolitics/comments/t495kh/30_years_in_a_weekend_the_geopolitical/hz3vpty/,1646259576,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646230761.0,

No. Imprisonment/sterilization/rape of the Uyghurs is 100% genocidal. Actions against Tibet have been similar. That cannot be minimized, regardless of China's impressive economic achievements.

China also violated its agreement to not interfere directly in Hong Kong until 2049. It is clear that the leadership wishes to invade Taiwan and destroy its way of life in a war that would be even more destructive than what is happening in Ukraine.

China could easily unlock additional growth through more private sector competition, but will continue to prevent this to prevent sharing power.

This is a good thing. It prevents the country from being beholden to lobbyists and corporate interests like many Western countries are. 

&gt;I would even agree with Xi this is a wise course of action if it was not for genocidal, aggressive, and anti-democratic actions that make the regime impossible to support.

Don't you think this is a bit of an exaggeration? The country hasn't been at war since the Vietnam war as opposed to other great powers like Russia and the US. 

It's obvious you're looking at it exclusively from the perspective of someone who lives in a developed country. If you're from a country who went from being poorer than most African countries in GDP per capita to a country who's now peers with the likes of the US and you saw your quality of life improve massively over decades, you'd likely not want to weaken your country's government given its current trajectory. This isn't Venezuela or Iran who are in economic doldrums we're talking about.

Of course, from the perspective of someone from Canada or Denmark, all they see is an authoritarian country rising so fast it's threatening to relegate the Western world to 2nd place.

* [China building Indonesia into an EV powerhouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/q8xb8a/china_building_indonesia_into_an_ev_powerhouse/)

I don't know much about Indonesia's foreign policy, I am more focused on its domestic environment and institutions.  Most people who study Indonesian foreign policy, don't understand Indonesia well. Even Indonesian diplomats don't have a good grasp of their own country, and I don't expect them to. Because you take a 22-year-old to alternate him between  Jakarta and foreign capitals for the next 40 years, he isn't going to understand Indonesia.

I am going to address some of OP points

**Underdevelopment**

&gt;Underdevelopment: Indonesia still relies heavily on the primary sector including agriculture and mining and their manufacturing sector as share of GDP has decline to about 20% in 2020 and is predicted to possibly decline further which symbolizes pre-mature de-industrialization of the country.

Share of Manufacturing is related but not industrialization, but it's not the same. You have to understand how manufacturing ([ISIC](https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/classification-economic-activities/)) is made up. It includes stuff like food and beverages. So Instant noodle is manufacturing.  [Indonesia's share in manufacturing has dropped to 20%, but stabilized and is slowly increased. It's not that much different from China which is about 26%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS) China has been dropping also over the last seven years. 

The drop in manufacturing started in 2008, due to a rise in commodity prices like Palm Oil and coal. But it's stabilizing now due to export restrictions on raw ore. and is most likely going to increase.

The type of natural resources also matters and how much. Too little, it's not good, Too much is also not good. Indonesia doesn't have a lot of natural resources for its size. It became an oil importer about five years after China. It can barely feed itself due to its geography.

**Geography**

&gt;Geography: As a collection of islands that are dispersed from one another this makes constructing infrastructure and logistics for wide economic development to very expensive.

Water transport is a plus and minus. It slows things down but also makes it cheap to transport items if you have enough ports and ships.

**State Capacity**

&gt;State Capacity: Indonesia's general bureaucratic and administrative capacities to implement major policies and programs have often been questioned by social scientists which can be further hampered by its logistical problems. I have read some reports about how Indonesian institutions have poor information management and data collection thus making policy-making more difficult.

Have you ever worked in the Indonesian government? You don't have any metrics. State capacity in Indonesia is weak because taxes as a % of GDP is tiny about 10-12%, compared to say 15% for Thailand, 30% for Vietnam/China. But Singapore is only 15%, Taiwan at 20%.  You also have to factor in its state-owned companies.

Data collection and management really depend on the government department. when it comes to population control, the Indonesian state can be determined how many X number of people live in a particular street, their age, religion, ethnicity.  [They use a Japanese household registration system similar to those in East Asia. It was introduced by the Japanese during WW2.](https://pudjiadi-prestige.com/rt-rw-jakarta/#:~:text=What%20does%20RT%20RW%20in,the%20community%20in%20one%20area)

States collect data that is important to them, what is important to a Western social scientist, might not be important to the Indonesian state.

**State capacity is a difficult thing to measure. China was able to control Covid because of its surveillance system and household registration system. Does it mean it's better than US or Italy's state capacity?**",2020d9bb5b7649ad19d84dad463f4a0e84bda944,True,False,,,,,0,1646253295,,0,{},hz3gf5h,False,t3_t4zxes,False,True,t3_t4zxes,/r/geopolitics/comments/t4zxes/is_indonesia_middle_power_of_asiapacific/hz3gf5h/,1646253311,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646224495.0,

Launching this war is a roll of the dice for Putin. It's true that he *might* end up stronger than before. But equally, he *might* lose everything.

[],False,,b-jensen,,,[],,,,text,t2_zuwfo,False,False,"Last war was in 2006. in another timeline, Hezbollah/Iran never attacked israel, and there was no 2006 war. so here's your answer, the entire history of Leabnon-israel wars can be summarized by: - some dudes thought it will be a brilliant grand idea to shoot across the border at Israeli cities from Lebanese land, Israel had to go in and 'mow the grass', until next time.

Without the PLO shooting from Lebanese territory at Israeli cities in the '70 and '80 you would never had Israel - Lebanon violence at that time, and without Hezbollah in 2006 to kidnap Israeli soldiers, you would never had 2006 war.

One morning In 2006 Hezbollah Kidnapped 3 Israeli soldiers out of the blue one day (Hezb claim they wanted to ransom them) when Israel refused, Hezb started to bombard northern Israel, without anyone in the Lebanese government even knowing that today they're going to war with Israel..

In 2018/19 Hezbollah was caught digging Multiple tunnels from Lebanon into Israel under the noses of UNIFIL in violation of un1701.

*  According to UN Res 425/426 in 1978, Israel agreed to withdraw from south Lebanon, and Lebanon agreed to ''ensure the return of its effective authority in the area'' (Not militias) . Israel withdrew, but Lebanese militias were still armed. ""Hezbollah, a Shiite group which exercises de facto sovereignty over much of South Lebanon, rejected Resolution 425 and continues to launch attacks against Israeli troops from time to time''




Some examples which forced Israel to intervene in Lebanon in the past are Avivim school bus massacre, of 12 civilians, nine of them children dead. or in 1978, when PLO made a beach landing south of Haifa, Israel, where they seized a bus, full of people, killing those on board in what is known as the Coastal Road massacre.  or in 1979 Nahariya attack , also Ma'alot_massacre when they murdered 31 civilians, 25 were hostages

Or In 1981, when from Lebanon opened a heavy and indiscriminate artillery barrage on the israeli Galilee panhandle using Katyusha rockets and 130mm guns. This barrage lasted 10 days driving the residents of northern Israel underground into bomb shelters.

After a cease fire, on April 3, 1982, an employee of the Israeli embassy [Jacob Barsimantov was murdered in Paris by a PLO who shot him in the head](http://pdfs.jta.org/1982/1982-04-05_065.pdf).

[],False,,erudaru,,,[],,,,text,t2_mudg2,False,False,"I think you are right, but seemingly also a bit biased. I'd like to add some nuances to what you said, and some reasons why and how Croats in BiH undermine the country in some ways:

Turning to Turkey and Erdogan is an expression of Bosniak nationalism. We can agree that this wouldn't be so strong if the national identity wasn't endangered. However, SDA is the only relevant party that is perpetuating such connections, and their power grip is loosening slowly but certainly. Bosniaks in general are more EU-oriented and share the same values you mentioned. Even those Turkey fans will point out that Turkey has a higher degree of secularism than half of the EU. When looking at [public polls](https://www.undp.org/content/dam/unct/bih/PDFs/Prism%20Research%20for%20UN%20RCO_Report.pdf) (PDF) you'll see that Croats and Bosniaks mostly agree on EU questions, while Serbs are the outlier. Bosniaks were actually a teeny-tiny bit more pro-NATO than Croats.

One important EU value you didn't mention is democracy. Bosniaks support the idea of democracy in BiH more that Croats do. Of course, their numbers are what allows them to be more confident in democracy. The last period of election reform negotiations, however, has shown that Croats are not in tune with the EU when it comes to this. Croats in BiH are pushing the concept of constitutive people, which is contrary to the Sejdic-Finci case in the way Croat leadership understands it currently. That's why I can't support all of the current mainstream Croat politics, and I'm saying that as a minority in Bosnia myself. While I believe in fair representation, I don't think it should be achieved via constituent people.

&gt;Bosniak core has repeateadly elected Croatian representatives

Yeah but think about this. If we talk about the presidency, before this happened, the accusation was that Bosniaks would never elect a Croat, and that's why there's a presidency of 3. So I'd say lets just go back to 1 president and problem solved. The fact that the liberal Croat won instead of the nationalist, thanks to Bosniak votes, proves that we should trust (or even be inspired by) Bosniaks more if we are EU-oriented.

The thing is that Croats already are EU citizens, so they don't care about the status of BiH in that regard as much as Bosniaks do, and it reflects in their politics and attitude towards their actual homeland, which was never great generally speaking.

Bosniak politicians are undermining the country by denying stuff like a TV station for Croats, and by playing nationalist and corrupt games in tandem with Dodik, while Croats undermine the country in other ways, and are not necessarily more pro-EU than Bosniaks.",ab7759084682f44f163fb0377402872d526895ff,True,False,,,,,0,1646246313,,0,{},hz2yazh,False,t3_t51o4c,False,True,t1_hz2m0vw,/r/geopolitics/comments/t51o4c/with_all_of_the_attention_being_on_uaru_conflict/hz2yazh/,1646246345,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646217513.0,

The thing that bothers me here is no one is allowed to call out the underpinnings of this crisis. If you do try to explain that what Putun did is rational, people get angry. We all know Putin is all the pejorative words people call him, but does discussing that help solve this at all? No. A deal should have been made well before we got to this point. However. What we have is the last gift of the unipolar moment. 

For the last 30 or so years, the US has been unchallenged in foreign policy. Russia basically said in 2008, ""No, I'm not playing along""  and started to resist. Now, Putin has miscalculated here, but I can't say how it will turn out. Since 2008, there have been many people who warned that Russia would burn down Ukraine before they allowed it to join NATO. Many in the US were unable to take Russia seriously and continued to not take their intentions seriously until recently.  One of the other problems is the assumption that Putin is irrational.  He does exhibit less emotional control than I'm used to seeing from him, but that doesn't indicate insanity to me. In Russia's case, if they had waited much longer, they would have been unable to stop Ukraine from getting NATO missile systems. If Ukraine had gotten those systems, Russia would be unable to do what it is doing now. Russia considers those systems a threat to its security. Furthermore,  it would be allowing itself to be pinned into its territory permanently - no great power does that, ever. 

None of that is to say it was the moral or ethical thing to do; I'm simply stating that it was rational if I'm in that actors shoes. It makes sense. The US should have known what it was doing would set up this crisis. As for its solution,  they make not like what they get if Putin does fall.

Would China be too afraid of being shunned by the international community for acting as Russia's economic fallback partner?

I also agree that diplomatic overtures towards the countries previously mentioned wouldn't necessarily bring anything of material benefit to NATO or the EU (more net beneficiaries rather than contributors is probably the last thing both groups want) but Putin has already signaled he fears Sweden/Finland formerly joining NATO (warning of military/political consequences), but bogged down in Ukraine, would reaching out to them be a way of calling Putin's bluff or forcing him to divert attention he needs solely in Ukraine, elsewhere? I almost doubt that he'd even consider following through with a military buildup in the north now that he's committed to Ukraine. Likewise, if he IS committed to additional buildups, he'd have to continue splintering his attention towards Georgia and Moldova to support the breakaway regions if they consider joining any western alliance as well. This would be absolutely overwhelming, pressure on three different fronts. Maybe this is too aggressive, the last thing we need is Russia trapped in a corner. (To some extent they already are.)

They focused on de-dolarization,  built an alternative to SWIFT inside Russia, China created an alternative to SWIFT, CIPS, in 2015, which has grown to include over 103 countries.

Tomaž Mastnak: 
For whose interests and benefits?
 As soon as the measures against Covid were revoked, we got the measures against Russia.  The revocation of anti-virus measures is most likely temporary.  Decision-making structures and enforcement mechanisms have remained in place, intact, they can be re-launched at any time, and we still have no defense or protection against them.  Measures against Russia are largely the work of the same forces with more or less the same goals.  In both cases, it is a centrally run globalist operation in which national authorities are merely subcontractors.  We are drowning in total propaganda, lies and manipulation.  The obsession continues.

 Since recovering from the disastrous Yeltsin era, the Russians have been working to reconcile the world's security architecture with new global power relations so that the security of one would not be to the detriment of the other.  Their position seems to me fundamentally rational, logical and supported by facts, and legitimate.  I cannot say this for the position of the United States and, in the alternative, the EU and NATO, which do not abide by the agreements and take away their special rights.  The military intervention is the result of a confrontation of these views, not some incomprehensible Russian perversion.  We can understand this war even less if we indulge in the obsession with Putin - just as we cannot understand the epidemic if we only see the virus.  The responsibility for the confrontation of positions and military escalation, not their coordination, is primarily American.
 The most general framework for explaining current events is the disintegration of the world order established after World War II.  Western propaganda blames Russia for this, but in reality this arrangement has survived because the balance of power in the world has changed significantly.  The main engine of the conflict is now the West-led effort by the West to maintain the global domination that is slipping out of its hands by force and at all costs.  However, if we were to look for concrete political reasons for the decline of this regime, NATO expansion to the east is among the key ones.
 NATO's expansion to Russia's borders violates an agreement between the former Soviet Union and Western powers during German unification that NATO will not cross the Elbe.  Now it is just one in a series of international arrangements and agreements that Westerners rejected after winning the Cold War.  For years, they have been trying to replace international law, which Russia insists on in principle, with ""rules of the game"" that they set themselves.  Then there is the anomaly in the structure of international law: outside its framework and within the framework of the UN Charter.
 With Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, the West has suddenly rediscovered international law and condemned Russia for violating it.  I leave aside the question of how solid the legal basis for Russian military intervention is.  However, I would like to point out that the world hegemony of the West after the Second World War was based on violence.  The atrocities in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were followed by at least 69 US wars, military interventions, coups, ""regime changes"" and similar most brutal encroachments on the internal affairs of other countries.  American violent violations of international law, assisted by Europeans, are a constant in postwar history.  Westerners have no moral right to resent Russia now, which is not doing anything they have not done and are not doing themselves.  It hurts and angers them that the balance of power has changed.
 All this and much more is captured by the notion of double standards.  This hypocrisy corrupts morality and corrodes thinking.  Declaring the movements of the Russian army on the territory of the Russian Federation as aggression and the American on the Russian borders as defensive (which we have often heard or read about in the last year) is also an attack on logic.  Add to this the savage censorship, the criminalization of dissent, and the arsenal of military-psychological tools, and we get moral, mental, and spiritual devastation like never before (which applies to both cunning and anti-Russian propaganda).  This is the price and condition for maintaining American-centric globalist domination.
 The envious regime has brutally annihilated democracy for two years, and now these anti-democratic forces are posing as a defender of democracy before Russia.  As the people began to resist the cunning regime, we now have, in addition to the internal enemy that splits society, the external one that unites it.  Anger at our rulers is directed at the Russians.  Both the ""anti-vaccine"" internal and Russian external enemies are not only demonized, but dehumanized.  Their views, views, desires and interests are not only inadmissible, they are downright unimaginable.  Americans and Europeans do not seem to be able to understand that NATO weapons, which are closely aimed at the Russians, are an existential threat to them.  They can no longer even imagine anyone still opposing Nazism today.  The United States stopped denazification in Germany as early as 1946-1947.  The CIA has been working with Ukrainian Nazi collaborators and neo-Nazis for more than 70 years.
 The U.S. is working at least for its own short-term benefit, albeit illusory.  But Europeans have gone mad.  Their Russophobia is worthy of Nazi propaganda films from the beginning of Operation Barbarossa.  The sympathy for the fellow man they now show to the Ukrainians is not convincing because they did not show it to the Iraqis, Afghans, etc., nor were they bothered by the eight-year shelling of Donbas.  The war, which could have been prevented, but they preferred to help boil it, is now being fanned.

 They sacrificed Ukraine for American geopolitical ambitions, and Europe with hysterical anti-Russian measures.

They saw a weak Russia and expanded NATO despite the verbal agreement with Gorbachev that they wouldn't expand one inch eastward.

I think this is a misframing. Firstly, the promise was a verbal assurance they wouldn't expand east, which was immediately retracted once the President found out such an assurance was issued. If anything, initial NATO ""expansion"" (read: Kohl getting Gorbachev to agree to allow Germany to choose to join NATO if the people wished through going behind the backs of allies and taking advantage of Gorbachev's weaknesses and lack of ability to effectively control fast moving diplomatic shifts) was down to the member states in reaction to fear of Russia.

Many people have the agency the other way around, depicting NATO as ""expanding"" into these countries, and encircling an afraid Russia.

I'll copy and paste a related comment here:

Even pre-Putin, looking at it purely through the throughline of NATO-USSR, Yeltsin's use of violence against his own people and political opponents also bolstered calls for a hedge against the potential renewal of Russian aggression. This led to abandoning the partnership approach/PfP and Article 5 guarantees for all.  
  
Imo the mistake many do is believe in NATO expansion as the phases of ""who joined and when"" and looking at it as phases of expansion.  
  
This has merits but In practice I believe looking at it as a series of turns, which could only ever move in one direction, is better. The first being Bush opposing all options-- including ones promoted by his West German allies for contingent enlargement-- short of extending full Article 5 guarantees after the fall of the Berlin wall. A lot of this was simply wanting to secure a strong alliance once in a good position, and not wanting to concede now they had won-- thinking the USSR would never afford them that luxury.  
  
The Second turn, in response to Russian aggression and skilled diplomats arguing Eastern Europe was being hung out to dry and framing withholding Article 5 as giving Moscow a veto, Clinton tipped from balance towards Article 5 guarantees for all. This was not a US trick to incrementally expand by moving from PfP to full membership from the outset, but was decided when impassioned calls for protection from Eastern Europe in face of Russian violence tipped Clinton from balance, which led to Russians pushing the idea it was more NATO trickery all along  
  
The third was Clinton’s decision to have the April 1999 Washington summit welcome Baltic interest in NATO.

Given that:

1. Territorial integrity and national sovereignty are the premise for the war,

1. That small states value these two principles above all else when their existence and independence literally depend on big states respecting it,

1. And that there are far more small states than big states in the world,

... will mean that the current Western led ""rules based international"" order will find more buyers after this crisis. You need to look no further than the support and speeches at the United Nation General Assembly from states after states as varied as Kenya, to Singapore, to the Pacific island nations.

No principles are more sacred to small states then territorial integrity and national sovereignty, and the world have seen when the push came to shove which countries was willing to put their money where their mouth is.

Unfortunately, I suspect a number of states would have been especially disappointed with India. Modi, who had an excellent opportunity to distinguish India from its rival rising power, however like China, could not look pass its narrow self interested relationship with a diminishing Russia. This a geostrategic mistake of the ages.

Just as states around China are increasingly nervous about its rise and have formed or are forming coalitions to contain it, states will now have reasons to be nervous also about India's possible future rise. I am sure South Asia and SEA states are especially disappointed and possibly nervous that India did not put its foot down to declare territorial integrity and national sovereignty sacrosanct no matter the cause, especially when a number of them have historical grounds for possible future territorial disputes with India herself. Countries will now have reason to believe a powerful India may behave like a powerful China.

China wants to end the liberal international order. Having Russia as an ally, because Russia shares that same goal, is useful until it isn't. So China will, as always, try to see what it can get away with. If it can keep Russia alive longer, draining Western resources, it will so long as doing so, and the extent to which China is doing so, doesn't cause too many diplomatic consequences. China cares about the opinions of the non-aligned nations, and about dividing the West rather than galvanizing it.

So the diplomatic dance will continue. But if China oversteps and goes too far in supporting Russia economically, the West needs to counter. How far the West goes to counter depends on many factors, but if things really spiral out of control and it becomes China and Russia vs. the West, then the West may need to split the world economically into Us vs. Them. All countries are forced to choose sides eventually. That is definitely one way it could play out. 

The ultimate level of sanctions is blockade, but that is beyond sanctions and a true act of war. But it is the kind of war that makes it hard to retaliate with nuclear weapons. If Cold War containment isn't working, maybe because too many neutral countries choose China, then blockade becomes an option. 

This may seem extreme, but I would not underestimate the West if it has to actually stare into the abyss of its world order dying.

Let's take the economy, for instance: I'm sure without a doubt that the Russian economic will take a big hit. And yet you can find - but you won't see it in the regular news channels - Russia closing gas deals with China for 50billion square tons of natural gas; further deals with Pakistan for the supply of gas, wheat and tanks; Russian announcing that India will receiving S-400 missile systems and parts; China, Brazil and Argentina announcing that they won't sanction Russia over the past few days; #IStandWithPutin trending on Twitter in India today; the Saudis announcing that OPEC + Russia is good as ever...

Not only more than half of the world isn't playing along the Ukrainian side of the story, you see a clear departure of BRIC - and probably a huge chunk of the global south - from the NATO stance. They are more skeptic of NATO narrative because they see what's happening in Ukraine but they still get news from Somalia, Yemen, Palestine, Syria this same week... there's a big dissonance right there. 

Now let's go back to the economic side of things: How are all these countries going to pay Russia and in what currency now that Russia is off SWIFT? CIPS? SPFS? We seeing a rupture of the SWIFT's monopoly and this happened to be the perfect excuse for Russia to break away from it. It's much worse than that because natural gas, that usually goes for 200 USD/metric ton on a regular winter is going for 2200 USD/metric ton as of today... and EU will have to pay Russia (they won't stop buying gas in the middle of winter) using other currencies and other payments systems other than SWIFT. 

There is economic carnage hammering the Russian economy but it seems like MAD plays both ways in an economic sense too... gas prices are going up all around the world - BRENT is at around 110USD/barrel (imagine how this is helping an economy such as Venezuela's at the moment that was at the brink of total collapse a couple of years ago) - but inflation is eating up people's salaries everywhere including the US and, Latin America, its backyard. Imagine what will happen if the following occurs:

How will this affect politic stability in western and western-aligned countries?

As for the military advances, it's much better to wait a couple of weeks. I've followed the Syrian Civil War for years, and I have an idea of how these things go: take a look back at the moment when Obama pronounced his famous red line in Syria in 2012 and how Al-Assad was at the brink of annihilation, Lavrov took that red line and announced a whole plan based on the destruction of chemical weapons that saved Al-Assad politically and the SAA began a slow grind that, with the help of Russia, took back Hama, Homs, Eastern Aleppo, Daraa, broke the Aleppo seige, broke the siege of Deir-ez Zor, liberated Palmyra, took back Latakia, kept Turkey at bay...

Not saying this is your situation, but no shortage of [fools](https://providencemag.com/2019/07/west-overestimates-aleksandr-dugins-influence-russia/) have weighed in on Dugin without demonstrating the slightest understanding of what he has actually said, why it matters or even proposing an articulable method to evaluate his influence (much less assessing his influence in any kind of systemic or reliable way).  You should read what Dugin actually wrote and listen to his lectures, or translations of them (to the extent you can find them in English).  

For example, for some inexplicable reason folks have cited to the above-linked article by George Barros as ""credibly"" reflecting how ""the West [o]verestimates . . . Dugin's [i]nfluence in Russia.""  I guess because Barros knows how to make sure his op-eds in irrelevant online publications appear in Google's search results?  That's not a good method of assessing reliability, but I digress.  The point is that the article is vapid, its analysis is shallow and citation to it is a a self-evident reflection of ignorance with respect to the matters covered therein.  

First, Barros' article is adjective-heavy (and ad-hom heavy), but analysis-light.  He describes Dugin as a ""shaggy, bearded philosopher with a [mere] penchant for geopolitics.""  Dugin is a professor of sociology at Moscow State University.  That would be like me calling Noam Chomsky a ""shaggy, bearded political commentator with a penchant for linguistics.""  Barros' pedestrian, sophomoric insult doesn't even rise to the level of idiocy; and this theme continues throughout the rest of the article.  But the point is clear.

Second, Barros' article embodies the [deficits in comprehension](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hz1b21b/) endemic to Western commentators on Russian geopolitical strategy I identified in another post.  For example, most people who talk about Dugin have not actually read Foundations of Geopolitics or listened to a single one of his lectures.  

Here, Barros argues ""most people who talk about Dugin have not actually read Foundations of Geopolitics or listened to a single one of his lectures.""  Then he cites to [this now-removed article in the Nation](https://archive.fo/jZNR3), which embodies the same deficits.  Both failed to appreciate the extent to which anyone who thinks like Dugin could have any influence or role in the affairs of a modern state, because extent of incongruity between Dugin's worldview and theirs --- as reflected in the analogies to ""the likes of Richard Spencer"" and ""Glenn Beck.""  The shallowness of Barros' analysis is almost comically absurd.  For example, he argues that: 

&gt; A more than surface-deep look into the Russian zeitgeist reveals that Aleksander Dugin, as controversial and reprehensible as he is, is not the mastermind many in the West frequently and mistakenly make him out to be.

It turns out that analogy to stateside far-right types has no relationship to whether someone is or is not influential inside the government of a foreign country. 

Third, Barros' argument essentially comes down to ""Dugin is a stupid, backwards hack therefore he can't possibly matter, so why are we talking about him?""  For example, according to Barros: 

&gt; Many casual Russia observers and armchair Kremlinologists ascribe grand power to the controversial philosopher using speculative evidence based in hearsay. While Dugin does enjoy some publicity in Russia, his personal eccentrics and appearance of influence, coupled with Putin’s aggressive foreign policy, facilitated the plausible narrative in a Western media echo chamber that Dugin is Putin’s strategist.
&gt;
&gt; . . . 
&gt;
&gt; [J]ust because Dugin prescribes certain strategies that are present in Russian policy does not mean that Dugin was the policy’s inspiration or catalyst. 

Then Barros lays his cards on the table:

&gt; Exercising my own judgement, I can say that from my own discussions with Russian scholars, academic discussions on this field within Russia do not fixate on Dugin, but instead focus on mainstream names in international relations theory: Hans Morgenthau, John Mearsheimer, Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukuyama, Joseph Nye, etc.— Dugin is not really included amongst their ranks.

Conspicuously, Barros' article doesn't even *identify* factors through which Dugin's influence should be assessed or measured, much less any attempt to actually assess or measure it.  Irony aside --- e.g., Barros writes with the magisterial tone of a first-year IR student and himself is little more than an armchair Kremlinologist whose insight is self-evidently based only on Western media echo chamber-type pontification --- the argument is unavailing.  By his own admission Barros bases his opinion on what he's heard from unidentified others who he claims are ""Russian scholars"" and ""interactions with Russia and intelligence experts.""  

This vapid, ad hoc speculation is unavailing.",6f364f71a9ef1eec81b01667ca1b7fc70940ca0c,True,False,,,,,0,1646225072,,0,{},hz1jm2m,False,t3_t488qo,False,True,t1_hywwkdk,/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hz1jm2m/,1646225083,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646196272.0,

I assume Putin/the Russian government is a rational actor. Such that I can make predictions. Lets define first: lets call the expected added gain minus the expected added loss the expected benefit. If the expected added cost of the conflict is higher than the expected added gain,then the expected benefit is positive. If the expected benefit is negative, then it is more optimal to terminate conflict. Putin would like to optimize the expected benefit in time. So if a bit cost for tomorrow will deliver more gain the day after, then waiting to days is optimal.Gains: Rally around the flag (Domestic stability), Reducing capacity of hostile power (National security), prevent revolutions in the ""Russian world"" by showing high costs (Domestic stability and National security), Army experience (National security), Forward deployed troops (National security), Control of infrastructure (National security and economy), Direct influence in Ukraine politics (National security and economy), Russian weapon demonstration (National security and economy), more control over domestic economic production (economics).Costs: Domestic opposition (Domestic instability), Reduced army material and manpower (National security), Reduced national economic capabilities (National security), Increased hostilities from foreign powers (National security), Increased capabilities of hostile powers (National security).With Russian control over the Russian media, a large security force (fsb etc), a large army, large foreign reserves, and having hostile powers dependend on its energy exports: Russia can be expected to deal with the costs for a long time.To come back to your question. What I consider an acceptable outcome for Putin, when Russian troops inside Russia are defection almost everything is acceptable. But before that, Ukraine increasing rights for Russian speaking Ukrainians (for Domestic consumption), shifting blame of high losses to some other Russian high offical(s) (Domestic stability), (shared) control of Kherson (to protect and sustain Crimea), Ukraine officially secedes Crimea to Russia.",cd6fd546cd9f3247a6a743f91c7e14676b4daf3b,True,False,,,,,0,1646221200,,0,{},hz1dgya,False,t3_t495kh,False,True,t1_hyxx5wq,/r/geopolitics/comments/t495kh/30_years_in_a_weekend_the_geopolitical/hz1dgya/,1646221211,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646192400.0,

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"Dugin is a big influence on Putin.  

If Russia is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma inside a riddle, Alexander Dugin is the mystery --- at least to Western audiences.  Dugin is a key, highly influential advisor in Putin's regime and that is reflected in every foreign policy (and many domestic policy) decisions Putin has made in Russian since shortly after the time George Bush invaded Iraq.  At least in my experience, there are several layers to this problem:

First, at the outermost layer, most people who talk about Dugin have not actually read Foundations of Geopolitics or listened to a single one of his lectures.  So, the reason Dugin occupies this ""mystery"" role, as I said above, has nothing to do with whether his ideas are accessible.  They are widely accessible.  For example, Foundations of Geopolitics, his book, is widely available (in English) and Dugin's [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F02LpsEuAuk), whether from Moscow State University or otherwise are also pretty widely available (albeit not in English).  Instead, they've read second- or third-hand hearsay, and encountering all of its obvious associated problems. 

Second, even if people have read Dugin's writing or encountered his lectures in some context first-hand, the extent of incongruity between his worldview and theirs prevents them from understanding what he is saying.  This isn't just a surface-level problem, either.  It spans from the foundation of ontology to the particularities of the society and culture in which we live now.  For example:

* while the West is for Liberalism, Dugin is for its rejection; while the West is for Modernity, Dugin is for its rejection; 
* while the West is for technology, Dugin is essentially an anti-tech luddite; 
* while the West is for a rules-based international order, based on institutions and international law, Dugin regards that order's formation as an embodiment of modernity's ossification, at the hand of globalist-type interests that are irreconcilable with Russia's or those of greater Eurasia; 
* while the West is for progress, Dugin regards progress as predestined towards post-modernity and nihilism, and argues for its rejection in favor of something more recognizable to Heidegger; 
* while the West is preoccupied with either individualism or identity politics, dichotomies of power and their impact on the disenfranchised, Dugin is for traditional culture, norms, values and institutions outside the state (e.g., the Russian Orthodox Church) and argues for their importance for societal cohesion and stability; and
* while the West (or at least the United States) seems to favor unipolar hegemonic rule, wherein the United States is the sole hegemon; Dugin wants a return to the multipolar status quo ante, for the jungle to grow back and for us to return, essentially, to Macro Polo's world.  

Further, Western academics (and journalists) in particular tend to be so fundamentally separated from Russian and Eurasian history and tradition that they can't connect what he is about to what they think they understand about the world.  Dugin himself has commented on this.  For some strange reason, people seem to think Putin was joking when he said the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in history and/or they dismiss the idea that Putin is trying to ""rebuild"" any sort of similar empire, reflexively.  

Eurasia, to Dugin (and Putin) is the former Russian Empire.  Eurasia, to Dugin (and Putin) is what ""the West"" is to many in the United States and Europe.  It's not just about supranational trade alliances, although those are important.  It's about uniting the former Russian empire under a unified political heading, rejection of Enlightenment ideals/notions of ""universal rights"" and ""human dignity"" and uniting the (eastern) Orthodox world under.  

Third, even if people can get past the existential incongruity between where Dugin is coming from and where they are to the point they can intelligibly describe it, they struggle to appreciate the extent to which anyone who thinks like him could have any influence or role in the affairs of a modern state.  They try to put Dugin into familiar baskets, like ""right wing nut job"" or some such nonsense. 

Bottom Line: If you want to understand Putin's Russia, you have to understand Dugin.  Realize that I am not endorsing, nor would I endorse, Dugin's worldview.  But, what folks in this hemisphere don't really seem to understand is that it's irrational to dismiss his ideas based on what you heard someone else say about him, your subjective disagreement with them or your assumptions about them based on your subjective disagreement.  Some combination of those tends to characterize the majority of how ""foreign policy"" types here talk about him.",8db8ee7b674c72040558b52ea2208921b29fa85b,True,False,,,,,0,1646219422,,0,{},hz1b21b,False,t3_t488qo,False,True,t1_hywt18y,/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hz1b21b/,1646219437,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646190622.0,

I think there are a lot of potential aims, most of which aren't mutually exclusive:

- Kill Zelenskyy and decapitate the government. I think this is one of the big ones and there are rumours of private military companies deployed to Kyiv with orders to kill Zelenskyy.

- Establish a land bridge to Crimea by taking Kherson, Melitopol, and Mariupol. At present it appears both Melitopol and Kherson are in Russian controls. Mariupol was reported to have been subject of an amphibious assault, although no video or pictures have emerged, at least not that I've seen.

- Bolster Putin's reputation at home - fair to say this one has had suboptimal results.

Other considerations are: 

- that Putin could be seizing as much of Ukraine as possible in order to strengthen a bargain position to seize specific territories, perhaps Donbas and the Crimean land bridge.

- that Putin also wants a land bridge to Transnistria, Moldova, in order to annex it.

- that Russia is suffering a demographic collapse, and Ukraine is a source of slavic people that are culturally similar to Russia, although I've not seen evidence that this is an explicit war aim, it's an interesting dimension to consider.",f9ea7f88bb342a342d19caba0c3e1afbc950f7ba,True,False,,,,,0,1646217884,,0,{},hz1944q,False,t3_t495kh,False,True,t1_hz0yefp,/r/geopolitics/comments/t495kh/30_years_in_a_weekend_the_geopolitical/hz1944q/,1646217899,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646189084.0,

The 2014 crisis started because Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the EU.  As far as the EU (as a corporate body that includes its member states) is concerned, Russia is trying to dismantle its economic system through force, so it's going to respond accordingly. On top of that, the EU can't be sure that some isolationist won't be elected in the 2024 US elections. 

It seems every American think tank from the Heritage Foundation to the Quincy Institute is missing this point. I'd guess the reason the US  mostly talks about NATO and 2% is because that's where Washington has loads of influence(and opportunities to make money). Europe has other ways of defending itself from Russia besides spending large sums of money on American hardware. The easiest way to avoid a Russian invasion is to ensure it can't attempt one in the first place and to minimise its influence in Ukraine and Belarus. While the Eastern Partnership wasn't a deliberately anti-Russian arrangement at the start, it most certainly is now.

I think the Brexit negotiations should be regarded as an informative precedent. Here, the EU started using its economic leverage to push its sphere of influence into Northern Ireland, rather than allow the UK to use the risk of violence in NI to undermine the Single Market.  I remember back in 2017 and 2018 it seemed practically every Anglo-American analyst predicted on the basis of 'Realism' that Ireland would fold or the EU would throw Ireland under the bus. Having crossed the  line by interfering in a permanent UNSC member like that, it's not much of a stretch for the EU to similarly try to economically coerce Russia into renouncing its claims on Ukraine.

Sure, why not. I'll give it a shot, because there are plenty of avenues to escalate:

Close US air/port space to Russian craft (done).

Exert influence/ make promises to meet energy needs to get the rest of the banks not currently removed from SWIFT (for the EU to make oil payments) off of there. The US can probably find the budget to subsidize gas export (to the EU) at least enough to make it more palatable to nations there than the Russian alternative, at the very least in a timeframe short enough to exert real pressure.

Increase the speed, volume, and impact of arms deliveries to Ukraine. There are still avenues to ""escalate"" in the type and scale of technology we are providing, without putting a single American boot on the ground. 

Arms deals with European nations to provide their older airframes (the ones that the Ukrainian air force has experience with) in exchange for more modern American-made airframes. (Similar to the deal that mostly fell through earlier, instead with the backing of the US and more beneficial arrangements for donating nations)

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"Dugin is a big influence on Putin.  

If Russia is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma inside a riddle, Alexander Dugin is the mystery --- at least to Western audiences.  Dugin is a key, highly influential advisor in Putin's regime and that is reflected in every foreign policy (and many domestic policy) decisions Putin has made in Russian since shortly after the time George Bush invaded Iraq.  At least in my experience, there are several layers to this problem:

First, at the outermost layer, most people who talk about Dugin have not actually read Foundations of Geopolitics or listened to a single one of his lectures.  So, the reason Dugin occupies this ""mystery"" role, as I said above, has nothing to do with whether his ideas are accessible.  They are widely accessible.  For example, Foundations of Geopolitics, his book, is widely available (in English) and Dugin's [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F02LpsEuAuk), whether from Moscow State University or otherwise are also pretty widely available (albeit not in English).  Instead, they've read second- or third-hand hearsay, and encountering all of its obvious associated problems. 

Second, even if people have read Dugin's writing or encountered his lectures in some context first-hand, the extent of incongruity between his worldview and theirs prevents them from understanding what he is saying.  This isn't just a surface-level problem, either.  It spans from the foundation of ontology to the particularities of the society and culture in which we live now.  For example:

* while the West is for Liberalism, Dugin is for its rejection; while the West is for Modernity, Dugin is for its rejection; 
* while the West is for technology, Dugin is essentially an anti-tech luddite; 
* while the West is for a rules-based international order, based on institutions and international law, Dugin regards that order's formation as an embodiment of modernity's ossification, at the hand of globalist-type interests that are irreconcilable with Russia's or those of greater Eurasia; 
* while the West is for progress, Dugin regards progress as predestined towards post-modernity and nihilism, and argues for its rejection in favor of something more recognizable to Heidegger; 
* while the West is preoccupied with either individualism or identity politics, dichotomies of power and their impact on the disenfranchised, Dugin is for traditional culture, norms, values and institutions outside the state (e.g., the Russian Orthodox Church) and argues for their importance for societal cohesion and stability; and
* while the West (or at least the United States) seems to favor unipolar hegemonic rule, wherein the United States is the sole hegemon; Dugin wants a return to the multipolar status quo ante, for the jungle to grow back and for us to return, essentially, to Macro Polo's world.  

Further, Western academics (and journalists) in particular tend to be so fundamentally separated from Russian and Eurasian history and tradition that they can't connect what he is about to what they think they understand about the world.  Dugin himself has commented on this.  For some strange reason, people seem to think Putin was joking when he said the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in history and/or they dismiss the idea that Putin is trying to ""rebuild"" any sort of similar empire, reflexively.  

Eurasia, to Dugin (and Putin) is the former Russian Empire.  Eurasia, to Dugin (and Putin) is what ""the West"" is to many in the United States and Europe.  It's not just about supranational trade alliances, although those are important.  It's about uniting the former Russian empire under a unified political heading, rejection of Enlightenment ideals/notions of ""universal rights"" and ""human dignity"" and uniting the (eastern) Orthodox world under.  

Third, even if people can get past the existential incongruity between where Dugin is coming from and where they are to the point they can intelligibly describe it, they struggle to appreciate the extent to which anyone who thinks like him could have any influence or role in the affairs of a modern state.  They try to put Dugin into familiar baskets, like ""right wing nut job"" or some such nonsense. 

Bottom Line: If you want to understand Putin's Russia, you have to understand Dugin.  Realize that I am not endorsing, nor would I endorse, Dugin's worldview.  But, what folks in this hemisphere don't really seem to understand is that it's irrational to dismiss his ideas based on what you heard someone else say about him, your subjective disagreement with them or your assumptions about them based on your subjective disagreement.  Some combination of those tends to characterize the majority of how ""foreign policy"" types here talk about him.",8db8ee7b674c72040558b52ea2208921b29fa85b,True,False,,,,,0,1646200840,,0,{},hz0mb8y,False,t3_t488qo,False,True,t3_t488qo,/r/geopolitics/comments/t488qo/is_alexander_dugin_truly_a_big_influence_on_putin/hz0mb8y/,1646200855,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646172040.0,

And the author has written about it.

Just a couple quotes:

&gt;anctions—restrictions on trade, arms embargoes, asset freezes and various other measures—are a core component of the diplomatic toolkit of States. In the settlement of international disputes, sanctions have a critical role to play as a strategy that falls between diplomatic negotiation and, in very specific circumstances, the use of military force.Footnote1 They have particular value as a means of punishing or deterring perpetrators of human rights atrocities, given the inherent weaknesses in the international criminal justice system; and they also have particular value as a way of depriving individuals, entities and in some cases States of the means to commit human rights atrocities.Footnote

&gt;The General Assembly has a rich history of recommending sanctions. Throughout the 1960s–1980s the Assembly recommended to States that they adopt a range of coercive measures in various contexts including struggles for self-determination and independence in Africa,Footnote6 South African aggression and apartheid,Footnote7 and Israeli aggression in the 1980s and 1990s.Footnote8 This practice, together with the Assembly's well-established legal competence to make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN Charter,Footnote9 provides a solid foundation for the Assembly to make recommendations to States regarding the imposition of sanctions.

The article explains a lot more than that including the history and  a kind of ""reconciliation"" or justification for their use. But these two key points are of interest

1) Sanctions - and what they are

2) The GA has a history with them.

The best index is refugees per million dollars of GDP which is topped by African countries.

Your 'history' is more than slightly edited. Palestine was never owned by the Palestinians, despite the name. It is not 'their' country any more than it is the country of the Jews.  


Israel is currently way too rough with the Palestinian population and that needs to end. But: If I was in Israel, I would develop a bunker mentality too.  


Btw: Do you think there is a reason no other country wants to accept Palestinians for re-settlement?

You think so? That would completely remove most incentives Russia has to withdraw from Ukraine with only ""light"" demands. If most of the sanctions are there even when they withdraw (which is the reason they were implemented in the first place), why wouldn't they just continue with the invasion and annex a good chunk of the country? Sanctions would therefore become meaningless for moderating Russia's behavior. 

By the way, airspaces bans are basically rendering flights operated by European airlines to East Asia economically unfeasable and will essentially hand them over to companies from China, Japan and South Korea.

I'd say it's more in Europe's interest to remove the sanctions are a peace agreement is reached than to keep them permantently - keeping Russia on the edge of economic collapse isn't good for stability and it would certainly push them closer to China. Wouldn't it make more sense to revoke most of them so they could still be implemented in the future if necessary?

&gt;Financial services company Nomura has said that in Asia, India is likely to be among the worst losers as a result of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Sustained rise in oil and food prices is likely to have an adverse impact on Asia’s economies, manifested through higher inflation, weaker current account and fiscal balances, and a squeeze on economic growth. In such a scenario, India, Thailand, and the Philippines are the biggest losers, while Indonesia would be a relative beneficiary,” the report authored by Aurodeep Nandi and Sonal Varma said.

Here is a Bloomberg article that presents more information from the report

India is hurt because it runs a current account deficit, which it balances through the capital account.  India isn't a big food importer but imports a lot of fuel and oils  Oil/Gas from the Middle East, Coal and Palm Oil from Indonesia.

We are dealing with the Basilisk of the End here.

Essentially, we have here a principle that can not even be discussed or acknowledged, let alone actually become enshrined as (non-top-secret) policy, because doing so would be inherently antithetical to the principle it is trying to embody.

That is, instead of expected MAD-based outcomes, another alternative becomes credible/a factor, namely: the calculus of abandoning one's responsibilities as a contractual ally, as a strategic ally, as an ideological ally -- as a human that feels anger and cries for revenge -- because you want to save the planet from hellfire, withering penumbra, and ice.

This card can be played exactly once per prospective ""cycle"". With ""cycle"" I mean the period starting at mass-availability of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and command structures that enable marshalling these; and ending at the instance of nuclear annihilation that collapses this exact system (i.e. the complex between technological and political factors that renders one MAD-capable). Within one such cycle, a strategy of MAD-based deterrence can be instantiated. Any atomic war between two premier world powers can be said to be ""invariant"" equal to total destruction of world civilization, so it doesn't even matter how many such MAD-capable factions we have (including the case of an -- initially -- singular global nuclear power disintegrating into two or more rivalling factions).

Within one such cycle, at the moment an event occurs that is expected to invoke MAD, the opposing (i.e. non-initiating) faction has a chance to *not* respond in kind. But what happens after this? No one knows, as literally no human has any clue -- neither personal statesmanship experience, nor legal precedence, nor dusty old tomes could be consulted for precedence.

But one thing is clear: the possibility of MAD deterrence for the refraining faction has ended. **To save the world, the refraining nation pays with the existential risk of game-theoretically surrendering its second strike potential.** It essentially ""checks"" out from the remaining factions, that may uphold MAD credibly. But most likely, MAD-based deterrence is for everyone permanently in doubt -- meaning a system with less than transparent outcomes. 

(Note: such a refraining faction of course still has credible *first strike* potential -- but it's obvious that entertaining/using such wouldn't exactly be conductive to global peace/survival.)

Why do I say it ""surrenders"" the second strike potential? Of course it doesn't technologically or politically. But this scenario is opening Pandora's box for unpredictable, *any* outcomes upon nuclear use. If, for example, a significant nuclear first strike can be ""negotiated"", how negotiable must then be tactical nukes? If a saturation strike against the industrial base of a country doesn't elicit a full nuclear response, are single city-busters now an option (empirically, the probability of full retaliation for more severe attacks is now less than 1)? 

But: any such discussion that nuclear use can be ""negotiated"" -- a bit too nonchalant, a bit too eager and enthusiastic, a bit too much not rejecting it as a desperate plan B (or plan Z) -- *aids* the idea that such a transform into a ""probability-based""/""human whims""-based system is a real possibility; and that in turn affects that possibility being realized by decision-makers once the *first* attack happens. It's a self-augmenting prophecy.

Of course, when I say ""discussing it too much is problematic"", I mainly mean discourse within the centres of power and influence, rather than Reddit posts. But it's not like the wider populace is a complete non-agent: if attitudes among the common citizen changes -- i.e. the unthinkable gradually becomes thinkable -- so will the tone in these echelons of power. 
And if we (in all relevant spheres) maximally establish the validity of non-MAD based outcomes? Then nuclear deterrence is already dead.

This is the Basilisk of the End. Discussing this too much will bring us the end.",7f6396b505a2ec502bbd95d5cf408a35a0b23b0c,True,False,,,,,0,1646189081,,0,{},hyzyjbm,False,t3_t3x39p,False,True,t3_t3x39p,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3x39p/does_mutually_assured_destruction_really_exist/hyzyjbm/,1646189096,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646160281.0,

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has opened a new era — and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, domestic. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system — but we should talk about this separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity — the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great price, yes, through the tragic events of the civil war, because now brothers are still shooting at each other, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies— but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russian Russian Federation is restoring its historical completeness by bringing the Russian world, the Russian people together — in all its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had refused this, allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, we would not only have betrayed the memory of our ancestors, but would also have been cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has assumed — without a drop of exaggeration - historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian issue to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia — for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of an anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost to pressure the West on us, is only the second most important among them.
The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation — when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples.

[],False,,PitonSaJupitera,,,[],,,,text,t2_3uursvcq,False,False,"Why do you think he needs territory? In my opinion, this was always mostly about preventing further cooperation between Ukraine and NATO and steering Ukraine away from pursuing what Moscow considers to be hostile policy.  There is an article called ""Russia's Compellance Strategy"" (or something like that) that gives more detailed explanation of Putin's potential reasons for the invasion - though it was written in January.

Even if there were any territorial demands being planned, those were likely scrapped when the sanctions were imposed and it turned out Ukrainians will put up a serious fight which would make occuption or annexation unfeasable.

I remember seeing there was news about Putin's demands for ceasing invasion - published either today or yesterday. Those were Ukraine's neutrality, recognition of Crimea, ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"". I have no idea what last two would imply - demilitarization could mean limits on kind of weapons Ukraine would posses but ""denazification"" seems only as a part of Putin's propaganda to justify the war. I'm guessing they could disband a few far right groups and call it a win.

Interestingly, Donbas isn't mentioned at all. I'm guessing the crux of the issue is that Ukraine can't join NATO or allow any NATO troops or equipment to be hosted on its territory - something Russia was upset about for a long time.

&gt;""if you ever think of joining NATO your capital will get destroyed with an artillery bombardment""

But he doesn't need to keep artillery within the range of Kyiv. At the moment Russians are using only Iskanders and cruise missiles to attack targets that far from the front lines (including Kyiv). The cruise missiles in particular can be fired from Russia's own territory.

I'm thinking that if Putin can convicingly defeat Ukrainian army (whose good chunk is stuck along the line of contact in Donbas and could be encircled) and seize Kyiv, that could compel  Zelenskyy to accept a peace agreement. After a serious defeat, the prospect of a later Russian involvement could potentially ensure Ukraine keeps their part of the agreement. Yes, this invasion was certainly costly for Russia, but it's even worse for Ukraine as they're the ones under attack.

However I have no idea if Zelenskyy could be willing to accept that. As a matter of fact, I'm clueless about what Ukranian strategy is at all. 

There is such a massive disproportion between Russian and Ukranian military that a conventional war between them can only result in a Russian victory. That's why I think the best choice for Zelenskyy would had been to avoid the invasion scenario entirely and negotiate an agreement without war instead of it being forced upon him after a defeat.

One possible explanation is that Zelenskyy actions are greatly influenced by what Ukrainians think - he doesn't want to end his career by being denouced as a traitor. One poll said that a few days ago 70% of Ukrainians believed in their victory. If Ukrainian army is defeated this number could drop and a compromise with neutral Ukraine could be more acceptable to Zelensky and his voters. Appeasing and calming his voters also explains his strangely dismissive public attitude to the risk of an invasion - almost no preparations were taken and reserves actived only a day before the Russian attack.",afc0d77e14e0b7381063fd9191945ee7ca4b3957,True,False,,,,,0,1646187372,,0,{},hyzujru,False,t3_t495kh,False,False,t1_hyxppm9,/r/geopolitics/comments/t495kh/30_years_in_a_weekend_the_geopolitical/hyzujru/,1646187388,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646158572.0,

Of course there are more simple ways for Mr. Putin to defeat himself, as the article writer points out...

That's geopolitics.  The idea about whether an ""expression means anything"" seems to be more about whether someone is ""forced"" to do something or not.   So assuming that what the UN GA does somehow ""doesn't mean anything"" is basically trying to divide geopolitics from geopolitics.

Out of what he straight up advocates the Austrian school of economics is probably the clear winner. Of course even there you have to dig. The core ideology is pretty straightforward. The canonical works do not beat around the bush about some of the rather unsavory logical conclusions. However there are layers upon layers of people promoting bits and pieces, minimizing the extremism while highlighting the attractive parts it is intrinsically linked to.

As a politician he's not going to be pinned down to the whole ideology but does non the less promote it. I'd argue that it's far enough removed from mainstream economics that you have to take it as a package deal or the internal consistency fails, so if you implement one of the great bits and it doesn't work out the only options are to turn back or you go back to the ideological fountain for something you didn't necessarily strongly advocate for the first time around.

You don't have to go all the way back to be able to justify banana republic levels of corporate control. At that point the question is whether US marines supporting South American governments against bandit uprisings is an intervention or just helping an ally restore order.

Yes, Alex Jones is an inflammatory example, there's plenty of less crazy who see Ron Paul as their champion. It's all very distributed and I don't mean that in a conspiracy sense. Separate groups with different beliefs that find common cause.

[Russian Campaign Assessment March 1](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-1)

**Key Takeaways**

* Russian forces are setting conditions to envelop Kyiv from the west and attempting to open up a new axis of attack from the east that would let them encircle the capital. It is unclear if Russia has sufficient combat power to complete such an encirclement and hold it against Ukrainian counter-attacks.
* Russian forces will likely launch a renewed ground offensive to seize Kharkiv following the air/artillery/missile attack it has been conducting in the past 24 hours.
* Russian and Russian proxy forces will likely solidify the “land bridge” linking Rostov-on-Don with Crimea, allowing Russian forces to move more rapidly from Rostov to reinforce efforts further west.
* Russia’s successful seizure of Kherson city may allow Russian forces to resume their interrupted drive toward Mykolayiv and Odesa.
* Belarusian forces have likely entered the war on Russia’s side despite denials by the Belarusian president.",0cc161f1e1620294b5cb881c2b07f2d2510a9594,True,False,,,,,0,1646180528,,0,{},hyzf8zj,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hyzf8zj/,1646180543,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646151728.0,

Germany's commitment to move to 3rd largest spender of defense (even after the 100 bn bonus they're adding in this year) is the largest sign of change.

China cannot be happy. 

If anything this takes the practice wheels off of ""what do we do when someone does this again""

China is watching this all very carefully as they'd have the same things thrown at them to whatever extent the West could manage.

It's one thing to cut off trade with Russia. 

If Maerk(and other shipping companies) and banks decided to not do business with China they would implode over night. They could see regime change.

They're also looking at the information war and how the US has used that to motivate other countries to join their side. 

Japan's former prime minister commented that maybe Japan should house US Nukes. That's a massive counterweight for the region. 

The point is that the US and EU were at a state of very strained relations after Trump and the wars the US were in the last 20 years. 

This has moved the US back into a lot of good grace and united the West more so than it's been since 9/11 and maybe before that to something like Kuwait / Gulf Storm Levels. 

This (to me) shelves the Taiwan question for several years at the earliest.
