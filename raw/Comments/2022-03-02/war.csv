China just had a shot fired across it's bow.  It's military framework is built closely around the same tenants as Russia's.... namely quantity over quality.  It's not at quite the technology disadvantage that Russia is, but not superior enough to feel comfortable.

Where Russia completely failed, is logistics planning.  Ukraine is right next door, and yet the bulk of it's armored forces ran out of fuel and food.  Contrast that with the U.S. military, which has 20 years of experience sustaining heavy combat forces in quite possibly the remotest landlocked location on earth.

By supporting an issue like Ukraine, you can easily some of the benefits most countries are getting to justify the risk of doing something. The rest don't justify the cost.

And you aren't really saying anything about how we can prevent these conflicts from occurring. In your post you said why nobody gave weapons to Georgia, asking for help to conduct war, not prevent or stop it. And the war in Ossetia is not as clear cut.

Some of these conflicts, there isn't really a clear good guy. Every conflict is mostly shades of grey. Who are you to decide who is in the right?

A big factor why Ukraine is getting great PR is because even if there is a Russian speaking minority in Ukraine, its 100% over the top to literally invade all of it. Nobody would have said shit if this contained itself in Donbass and Lugansk. The minority russians could have moved there if they wanted to. Plus Ukraine is democratic vs a big bad 20yr ruling dictator, plus all the geopolitical reasons I mentioned before. It is no longer a civil war.

Did you know the conflict in Yemen has been going over 10 years. Who is in the right at this point? Palestine or Israel? Human suffering doesn't pay for cyber security, missles, that sweet iron dome and stability in the region. Say what you will about Israel, none of the arab states are as stable as them. Plenty of countries technically helped Afganistan and that blew up spectacularly. Ended up not being worth it.

Syria was a failed arab uprising against a dictator - a civil war (nobody is really legally justified in interfering in any civil war). Do you go help the civilians fighting a civil war against a gov backed by Nuclear armed Russia?

Malay is a civil war as well. Georgia and Ossetia is literally  Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over Karabakh. Two people fighting over what they think is theirs. Nobody cared over the internet.

There is massive widespread condemnation of the plight of the Palestinians in the West. In my city (in UK) there's literally an information stall on the main Street every weekend. 

If you're going to raise the point of people calling Palestinians terrorists, you also have to defend the same claim with the IRA. 

There are pro Russia sympathies in the West, strangely coming from primarily the right which seems bizarre. Nonetheless, this kind of black and white thinking helps no one.

Second, Russians are terrible at the long game in war. This is the most thought out attack they've had in decades, and look how that's going. Though, thw long term gain would solidify their hold on the world grain markets. While China has a chokehold on production.

Third, this is the best thing that could happen for climate change, though not from the Russian point of view. The West is going to pour trillions into developing infrastructure and producing energy and vehicles not powered by fossil fuels. This will be to get around Russia's production of oil. 

They will also be investing in artificially grown food, to get around dependence on Russia's grain. China will be doing the same to support their population. 

Production by Western countries is going to start pouring out of China into the western hemisphere, Africa, and India/Southeast Asia. Being in the western hemisphere will greatly decrease carbon byproducts from shipping. This will also force the US to get rid of engineered obsolescence to decrease imports from China.

The situation in Palestine is nowhere close to WW3. Nobody gains anything if Palestine is any step closer to a state. And the conflict started so long ago, its literally daily boring news.

Libya is literally 3rd World military, no nukes, just a lot of refugees. So while it really sucks, southern europe hated it, most of the most vocal world wasn't affected.

Syria is the same as Libya.

Malaysia is the same as Syria and Libya. Except it's even further away so we don't have to deal with it. Oh and China backs it.

The current power of social media and the internet is also a big player. Some of these conflicts started quite some time ago. Long draw out conflicts lost attention quickly.

Georgia and Ossetia are super duper closer to Russia. I am more willing to believe there are more pro Russians there. Their willingness to fight is even less their Ukraine. You could argue that Russia totally expected a Georgia Ossetia situation when it invaded a few days ago. But nothing went to plan. And they didn't win over the internet.

And they, somewhere, just create the same narrative as ever had put as excuse like in this ""cristal generation"": ""ohhh, You bad, i'm good, i'm a victim"". When the reality is that USA is the biggest and most powerful bulked bully in Town.

The reality is that Russia is on guard cause their Best interests, and USA have better versions of the conflict.... Cause they already Made so many narratives ok every conflict to Say that they are the good man...when the actual situacion is nope. They invade and do whatever they want cause other countrys prefer to maintain peace in the worldwide rather than be on conflict with USA.

Why USA wanted to put bases on ukraine?
To their security?
For ukraine Best interest?
Nah.

Welcome to the start of 3rd world War..

If USA don't back up this time...
Russia is going to defend their borders and securities as they have Say, cause the menace comes not from Russia that is defending their borders.
Is coming from américa saying that Russia can't defend their borders.

And we already know that usa never back when they point their victim. Vietnam, middle east...actually.... Well ""europe"", what is defending américa un europe when their people are on other continent?....

América is like the looting guy in rust that live in a corner of the server and raid everybody cause they want resources to keep raiding ....instead of producing....woahh...probably if this was a Game USA already has like 100 bans...this remember My of the guy of nintendo that have like 1000 legal treats from nintendo, and have to close their channel...poor guy.

This isn't a Game, the world is Bad as ever....and we are on a border of another fallout Game....

I'll probably get down voted for this but fuck it. 

The way I see it is:
The U.S had *some* reasoning behind the invasion of Afghanistan where Russia had nothing concrete per say.
Having been attacked on home soil by Al-Qaida they invaded to find and kill/Capture Osama Bin Laden all the while punish the Taliban for harbouring such a target and other leaders within Al-Qaida. I could be wrong but that's my take on the ""justifications"" the US had over Russia.

Is what the US did over the ensuing years in the occupation? I don't think so but it dragged in a lot of nations such as mine, Australia, into the conflict and to be perfectly honest a lot of people see nations like Afghanistan as 'lesser'if they're from the west. On my journey through combat footage and pages with it, a lot of westerners get upset at the sight of western soldiers being injured or killed but at the same time have no issue with watching a squad of *insert Militia here* from a middle Eastern country get yeeted into the sky from an IED. 

The outrage caused of a super power invading Ukraine with the excuse of ""there's probably nazis and shit"" is in my opinion a justified response. We know this war is for Russian elite ego stroking and nothing less. The US at least had some grounds for invasion.

Did he want us to guarantee Ukraine won't join NATO so he could invade without major repercussions like he did anyway?

Ukraine is fighting and begging for help and we help. 

Ukraine citizens have been fighting corruption forever and trying to get in to the EU for a long time. In 2013 their corrupt president declined a deal that would have brought them closer to the union. They protested, were murdered and the puppet president fled to Russia. 

Then fucking Vladimir Putin used his military base in Ukraine to hold a vote in a sovereign fucking state and rigged it. Crimea gone to him. While also funding the “separatists” in the east Ukraine.

He isn’t asking. He isn’t dealing. The sovereign state of Ukraine and her people have their right to fight and defend their democracy. To continue rooting out corruption and build a future.

If somebody was taking over your country would you let them?

How can you possibly believe NATO guaranteeing Ukraine can never join that he wouldn’t continue to overthrow the Ukrainians will by force? You trust Putin?

The people of Ukraine deserve our help, they’re begging for it. Slavs are done being raped by Russia and I say send them all the stingers and javelins we can. Best use of my tax dollars ever.

As well as at the same time believe it or not the were setting up Comecon and Stalin was entrenched his ideological sphere of influence, so does it honestly look like they were gonna join? Then Putin in 2000 initially talked in  support of joining NATO, he didn't want to, and to direct quote, stand ""...in line with alot of countries that don't matter."" So putin decided instead of applying for NATO like everyone else he would do things like commit war crimes in Chechnya, or promis Ukraine it would leave it alone if it disarmed nuclearly and then take Crimea and now invade.

But… these have never been tested in combat. They have limited numbers of interceptors. They are better suited for the crude North Korean missiles rather than the much more sophisticated Russian missiles which have all sorts of tricks like decoys, multiple warheads, course adjustments etc. 

The main nuclear defense remains second strike. American forces have 3 arms to launch a nuclear rebuttal. Whatever silos and planes survive as well as the main second strike capability of our ballistic missile submarines. Each submarine can carry 24 missiles with 8 warheads each. Each warhead can deliver 100kTn yield, or about 8 Hiroshimas per warhead. So each sub can deliver (if maximum capacity) can deliver about 1500 times the destructive power of Hiroshima. We have 18 of these subs at any given time a bunch of them are submerged months at a time. So anyone who launches an initial strike would get hell fire raining down on them. And that’s not counting French and English nuclear subs who are allied with us with similar capabilities (the British even use the same missile, the French a more powerful one but fewer launch tubes).",66e37f3aacb220551c677a9e4fe69b87bf052ed8,True,False,,,,,0,1646197239,,0,{},hz0g0ak,False,t3_t4jrl2,False,True,t3_t4jrl2,/r/war/comments/t4jrl2/i_dont_know_much_about_nukes_but_is_there_any_way/hz0g0ak/,1646197255,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1646168439.0,,,,
