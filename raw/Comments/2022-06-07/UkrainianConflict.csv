It’s not a good thing, it hurts but that’s the real world. Unfortunately the arrival of the “wonder weapons” isn’t gong to change anything. The losses they are taking now cannot be replaced…they’re losing their best, most experienced troops and replacing them with civilians given days maybe weeks of training. Their air force is basically gone and 4 US drones won’t replace it. Plus once Russia finishes up in the DonBass they’ll begin to fortify it and Ukraine will need a 4-1, maybe 3-1 superiority to attack and defeat the entrenched positions. It’s not going to happen. 

Ukraine needs to save their blood and treasure and do what North Vietnam did…negotiate a settlement and then get what they want later.

Russian forces have likely established control over the majority of the residential sector of Severodonetsk and conducted assaults against Ukrainian positions in the industrial zone in the past 24 hours. The operational environment within the city remains fluid.

Russian forces continued efforts to advance on Slovyansk southeast from the Izyum area and west from Lyman, attempting to break through Ukrainian defenses that have halted most direct frontal assaults from Izyum.

Russian forces are likely attempting to reinforce their operations in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area from both the Toshkivka-Ustynivka area in the south and Kupyansk from the northwest.

Russian forces began withdrawing troops from positions in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely either to rotate damaged units into rear areas or to reinforce Russian defenses in northwestern Kherson Oblast, though ISW cannot currently confirm the destination of these forces.

Russian forces failed to regain advanced positions on the western (now Ukrainian-occupied) bank of the Ihulets River on June 7.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russian forces restored transit connections between newly occupied cities and Crimea.

Russian occupation authorities continue to face challenges suppressing Ukrainian resistance and finding partisan supporters despite increasingly draconian occupation measures and attempts to bribe Ukrainian civilians.",a0a0cb17d90562020b8ddd54584d2c12b7ada83e,True,False,,,,,0,1654645690,,0,{},ibjr0g7,True,t3_v7bebw,False,True,t3_v7bebw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7bebw/russian_offensive_campaign_assessment_june_7/ibjr0g7/,1654645704,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654616890.0,

Putin's Russia does not have the capability to hold the ground it takes. 

In the long term, the Russians will run out of materiel, money, and manpower. The West can supply money and materiel, but not manpower. Therefore, Ukraine may be best served by temporary tactical withdrawals which enhance its exchange rate. 

It takes a few months to make a tank or a combat aircraft, but it takes 18 years and 9 months to make an 18-year-old soldier, and if you pull them out of Cold War stockpiles you'll be disappointed to find that they're in their 50s and have probably deteriorated significantly, even if they were well maintained. 

Ukraine would therefore probably be best advised to exchange territory to reduce casualties in the short term, because it will get the territory back in the medium term when the Russians run out of combat power.

It's awful for the civilians who will likely be subject to ethnic / political cleansing by Russian occupiers, and the risk which this poses to the Ukrainian nation-state is considerable, but ultimately Ukraine must preserve its combat power if it is to survive.

I think this will now be a long war, and it will be won by endurance and resolve rather than Blitzkrieg. 

The West must continue to resolutely support Ukraine, despite what is likely to be a very hard winter.",ba768cc1e8488342e44dcfe8657d5c032c511a55,True,False,,,,,0,1654645104,,0,{},ibjpv88,False,t3_v6xwwb,False,True,t1_ibhsc2k,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6xwwb/putin_is_not_triggered_by_words_from_western/ibjpv88/,1654645122,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654616304.0,

You seem to be mad at me because I made a decision months ago that converting my list of *all* officers confirmed KIA (which is approaching 1,000 names) from plain text to html would be too much of a time commitment to maintain. Instead I chose to divide it at ""Senior Officers"" because, quite simply, it's easy to categorize and made it 1/4 of the work. Sure, I could have chosen to only track Generals or Colonels here, but then I wouldn't get the dopamine hit of adding another name most mornings. And again, this is a personal hobby that makes me happy, not some sort of attempt to influence... anything at all. I post the updates because people *asked* me to post the updates.

You are more than welcome to ignore the list, or just ctrl+f for Colonel if that's all you want to see. I even have a nice convenient counter at the top that will show you a breakdown by rank so you can ignore anything below Colonel if that's what floats your boat.

You seem to revel in arguing for the capabilities of Russian artillery, yet fail to recognize that artillery alone will not win this war. There is a reason why Russia has scaled back their invasion again and again to instead focus on extremely specific, singular goals where artillery is effective. If the goal is to take all of Ukraine, it's laughable that the world's second largest military has taken 3 months to occupy \~20% of a weak neighboring country, which still has not fallen.

But let me be more detailed and share some important factors you conveniently gloss over.

1. The creation of new arms and continued long-term support by first-world armies. The most you can do is argue that Russia has more artillery and the West's supply as not been significant, which are impressively weak arguments. If this is all you have to go on, then your confidence is laughably unwarranted for another two reasons.
2. Political incentives for the West to continue supporting Ukraine. Not only does the West want to limit the Russian sphere of influence, but Ukraine has done a phenomenal job of appealing to the West at every level from leader to citizen and leader to civilian. Ukraine is seen as part of the West and under attack from a dictatorship. Support for Ukraine will not stop until Russia has left the country. Even if by some miracle Ukraine is occupied in its entirety, the people will continue to receive support from the West.
3. The economic incentives for the West to continue supporting Ukraine. Russia currently holds the most resource-rich regions in Ukraine, which if Russia successfully holds, would somewhat restore and maybe bolster Russian economic strength for the next decade, or until renewable energy/nuclear power take over. By preventing Russia from occupying these regions or at least continuing to force Russia to contest these regions, the West has a straightforward method to prevent Russia from improving its primary source of economic power.

The choice of 1 year is to be generous to you. If you are right and the situation is as grim as you assert, you'll be proven right within this time. However, it's telling that these incremental gains give you a disproportionate amount of confidence and you appear to be eager to state that this conflict is over. Frankly, 1 year is far too short. Ukraine is of great strategic importance for the West to let Ukraine fall within that time.

It would be ridiculous to mean anti...speech itself (although I suspect that is exactly what it ends up being). I think in the US they call this ""hate speech"" or some other nebulous term like that. Perhaps they are talking about speech that incites hate and violence against someone or something. At any rate, there is no measuring gauge for what is ""hate"", it's one of those terms thrown around without much substance to it, but there may be a legal definition for it, or at least an attempt at one. I can tell you that Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" is a perfectly book to read in the US and if anything would qualify as ""hate speech"" it probably would be that book.

  Free speech, as it is known in the US does have some limitations. There are laws against defamation, slander and screaming ""Fire!"" in crowded movie theaters, for example. So if there are any Americans who find these restrictions too constrictive, they might be a tiny minority, I have not come across yet

  There is one thing that the US does not have, and that is a ban against the **media** of another government. There is no ban against the media of North Korea, for example. Or against the media of Iran. Or any other country the US is in political or military conflict with.

  I find it somewhat disappointing that Latvia, after many years under the Soviet boot (said boot including censorship of the outside media) is among the first to adopt the very same methodology now. It is not first, ahead of it is North Korea, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia and...

In the video you can see a DP-27 light machine gun. Also another very old gun, unlikely found in a frontline unit, they stopped producing this gun in 1950 so it’s over 70 years old. The Assault rifles look like AK47 and not the standard issue AK74. Once again old equipment. The truck is likely Russian as the Z has been scrapped off the door. All this equipment is usable and still deadly but prone to jam’s and failures.

Zelensky said that Ukraine is losing about 100 soldiers a day. The Russians are only losing an average of 300 a day (approx 30k dead within first 100 days of war based on the best estimates available). That's unacceptably close. I agree that it's inevitable that there *will* be some losses, but look at the Gulf wars and you will see 10:1 and 100:1 kill ratios instead of 3:1 or 2:1, and although that was full US forces against former Soviet client states rather than US clients against Russia, it was also with the US on the offense rather than the defense like Ukraine. 

Some losses, okay, however we shouldn't be accepting this level. It's very clearly due to failing to get enough varied heavy and high-tech weapons into Ukrainian hands and then failing to provide them with enough training to use those weapons effectively.

Further, quality matters significantly more than quantity. A single accurately placed artillery round is infinitely more effective than 500 rounds just lobbed randomly onto a few grid squares.

The main thing is to ask ""what are the tanks and APCs for?"" — in practice, there are a lot of other ways to achieve the same goals.  The ""o.g."" job for a tank was to take out an entrenched machine gun nest, and just generally to overcome the vicious ""defender's infantry advantage"" that showed up leading into WW1.

For some interesting examples — one thing Ukraine's been exploiting has been the *heinous* equipment-robbery in Russian logistics leaving their infantry in a very shitty situation where they usually have no night-vision cameras.  Since they're dead blind at night, Ukranian Special-Ops teams were able to prowl around the Kyiv front and pick off defensive positions at night with relative impunity.  Another thing has been the widespread use of drones dropping grenades and such.  Terrifying for trench soldiers.

It's a much slower, methodical way to cut into their defenses, and needs a spread-out, thinly defended front to excel (concentrated troops increase the odds of defenders having thermals and such), but it's a way to make slow, steady advances.

""Russia says its forces have seized 97% of Luhansk  
Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Moscow’s forces have control of 97% of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.  
  
Russian forces have seized residential quarters of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and are fighting to take control of an industrial zone on its outskirts and the nearby towns, Shoigu said.  
  
""The Luhansk governor, Serhiy Haidai, conceded that Russian forces control the industrial outskirts of the city, telling Associated Press:""

""A total destruction of the city is underway, Russian shelling has intensified significantly over the past 24 hours. Russians are using scorched earth tactics.""

The problem is you can’t just “attack move”, you have to have strategy, logistics, equipment, diplomacy and finesse.  

Say what you will about the US.  I was against the Iraq War, but when it came time to execute the plan, we didn’t just “attack move” our units in some kind of Zerg rush.  We hit strategic targets using well-trained, well-equipped, highly motivated forces that were deployed in a thoughtful manner.  

And before even attempting it, we secured our diplomatic flanks by getting Allies to contribute bases and troops or frankly just offering agreements so they would look the other way (cough cough China).

And when we finally took Baghdad, we did our level best NOT to line the population up against the wall and brutalize them.  (Most deaths were from Iraqi on Iraqi violence.)

563,[],False,,juddshanks,,,[],,,,text,t2_kght1,False,False,"&gt;In western world, prices of military equipment reach ridiculous heights and 10 billion dollars can be spent on rifle ammunition and ballistic plates in no time

10 billion dollars is a metric shit ton of money even in the world of military procurement. Take your pick from-

5 x Arleigh Burke class destroyers

10 x Patriot Missile Batteries

130 F 35s (or around 300 F 16s)

1000 x M1A2 Abrams battle tanks

170 000 x sets of US standard infantry kit including weapons optics and body armor.

The problem ukraine is facing is not lack of funds, it is the fact western countries are still making (thankfully now less restrictive) choices about what they will and won't supply, and the enormous logistical challenge of trying to train and equip troops on new equipment at the same time as they are desperately needed in an existential struggle in the east.

Which incidentally is one of the incredibly frustrating things about the West tardy and timid response to protecting Ukraine. If in december last year when American intel became convinced a russian invasion was imminent they'd acted, and spent 10 billion to give Ukraine, say, 75 F16s, a m1A2 armored brigade combat team  and 5 patriot batteries, it would have been far easier to get those units in place and get people trained. And there is an excellent chance that would have deterred russia and made an invasion impossible to execute at a fraction of the cost of foreign aid and ukrainian losses.

If there's one consistent lesson of the last hundred years of foreign policy its that weakness, cowardice and appeasement of totalitarian states cost far more in the long run.",268041d98fde30d5d6fe79101bcd83d0141161f8,True,False,,,,,0,1654638871,,0,{},ibjdg2s,False,t3_v6wyy4,False,True,t1_ibixevq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6wyy4/zelensky_explained_why_the_armed_forces_are_not/ibjdg2s/,1654638889,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654610071.0,

French journalist spread information that the French could send Exocet anti-ship missiles to the Ukrainian Forces  
As Navy Recognition informed with reference to the Twitter of Jean-Dominique Merchet, a French journalist working for the daily newspaper L'Opinion, France could send Exocet anti-ship missiles built by MBDA to the Ukrainian Forces.  
  
The Exocet is a French-built anti-ship missile whose various versions can be launched from surface vessels, submarines, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The Exocet saw its first wartime launch during the Falklands War.  
  
Development began in 1967 by Nord as a ship-launched weapon named the MM38. A few years later, Aerospatiale and Nord merged. The basic body design was based on the Nord AS-30 air-to-ground tactical missile.  
  
The sea-launched MM38 entered service in 1975, whilst the air-launched AM39 Exocet began development in 1974 and entered service with the French Navy five years later in 1979.  
  
The relatively compact missile is designed for attacking small- to medium-size warships (e.g., frigates, corvettes, and destroyers), although multiple hits are effective against larger vessels, such as aircraft carriers.  
  
It is guided inertially in mid-flight and turns on active radar homing late in its flight to find and hit its target. As a countermeasure against air defence around the target, it maintains a very low altitude while inbound, staying just one to two meters above the sea surface.  
  
Due to the effect of the radar horizon, this means that the target may not detect an incoming attack until the missile is only 6,000 metres (3.7 mi) from impact.  
  
Its rocket motor, which is fuelled by solid propellant, gives the Exocet a maximum range of 70 kilometres (43 mi; 38 nmi). It was replaced on the Block 3 MM40 ship-launched version of the missile with a solid-propellant booster and a turbojet sustainer engine which extends the range of the missile to more than 180 kilometres (110 mi; 97 nmi). The submarine-launched version places the missile inside a launch capsule.",9e39778606cdf100a8ffc2b238bb195e4447358f,True,False,,,,,0,1654637323,,0,{},ibjaaz0,False,t3_v77oor,False,True,t3_v77oor,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v77oor/ukrainian_armed_forces_can_get_french_exocet/ibjaaz0/,1654637342,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654608523.0,

I'm prepared for downvotes, as many people do not understand the realities of electric vehicles and solar charging at higher latitudes.

The pictured bikes (ATOM model) have a [**3816Wh** battery](https://eleek.com.ua/en/item/atom-boost-3000/).  600Wh batteries are what you'll find on a normal pedal bike with a good power assist (or something heavier like a fat bike).  A normal ""e-scooter"" type vehicle with a 32km/h governor will have about 1kWh battery, and give you maybe 70km range at it's max rated speed on flat ground, ignoring environmental wind.

Given the top speed and range of these, 3.5-4.0kWh seems pretty reasonable.  Typically, the battery is engineered to be about 130% capacity of the motor max' sustained power for one hour.  The motor on these bikes is 3000W sustained (6kW peak).

On the panels:  Ukraine is around 50 degrees north latitude, so even in the summer, the sunlight is passing through a *lot* of extra atmosphere, and atmosphere gobbles up what panels need.  IRL, panels that say 100W are not putting out anywhere near that (esp above 45 degrees lat).  With 2x100W panels, at 45 north lat, I can usually charge a 700Wh ebike battery by about 50% per day starting in late Feb, ramping up to 100% quite easily 45 days either side of the solstice.  Winter-side of the equinoxes is hit and miss, and cloudy winter conditions mean it could take several days (3-4) just to charge that 700Wh battery from zero to full - though I would never charge lithium to full, nor let it get to 0%, but that's a different story.

source: I've been building, riding and charging ebikes through solar for ~20 years.

Just last year they managed to get a record [26 reprimands](https://de.statista.com/infografik/25868/anzahl-der-durch-den-deutschen-presserat-ausgesprochenen-ruegen/) so they are not slowing down with ignoring the press code. It is so bad that a own blog called [bildblog.de](https://bildblog.de) was created in 2004 that solely covered lies from Bild and it even was the biggest blog in germany back in 2009 according to wikipedia.

Bild lies, manufactures stories and doesn't care about morals. They paid a 11 year old kid to give them the chat history of his friend who wrote to him trying to get help while his mother killed his 5 siblings and herself. They ignored his well beeing just for a story.

I don't think it's bold to claim more captured than lost, considering there are captures almost every day.

The stockpiles Russia have are obviously degraded, but more importantly, the tanks they have in those stockpiles use 115 ammo I think, which is not even produced in rusland anymore and require a 4 man crew and can be taken out by old AT weapons, don't reverse, guzzle fuel like crazy and are slow. 

Also add onto current losses, losses of about 30% due to maintenance, there was especially telling I think a ruski Pion that had a cracked breach and another that wouldn't fire. You can't just send unlimited shells through an art system because of warping and the ruskis are not producing any new art.

The ruski repair yards are so far from the front while Ukraine's are all homegrown. In Mariopal there were 6 modern Russian tanks just hanging out in a building complex due to breakdowns.

798,[],False,,SilverSquid1810,,,[],,,,text,t2_1xtw5q6n,False,False,"I think one can argue that Ukraine *was* a “calculated” move. The build-up to the invasion began well over a year ago. I vividly remember last spring when everyone was getting nervous about the Russian troop build-up. It was obvious, months prior to the invasion, that the level of preparation that Russia was engaging in was far too high for it to be a bluff. The Russian economy had been openly trying to attain autarky for years because they knew another major round of Western sanctions was on the horizon- which would only happen if they did something like, I don’t know, invade Ukraine. 

Not to mention that the subjugation of Ukraine has been the natural endgame for Putin for quite some time. Crimea and the Donbas were the first targets because they had the biggest pro-Russian populations. But the rest of Ukraine wasn’t simply going to be ignored. It has been abundantly clear for quite some time that Putin simply does not believe that Ukraine is a legitimate state. Putin published an essay last year denying that Ukrainians exist as a distinct ethnic group, instead subscribing to the patronizing “Little Russians” theory. Beyond the immense economic benefits from Ukraine’s agriculture and energy sectors, Putin simply does not believe that Russia is complete without Ukraine in some form, just like how Belarus has been in a “Union State” with Russia for quite some time. Putin is a Russian nationalist and his actions have long made sense when viewed from that perspective. 

Not to mention that just because Ukraine was “calculated” does not mean that it couldn’t be bad. I think we forget sometimes just how sickeningly corrupt Russia is. I highly recommend Perun’s YouTube video about Russian corruption if you haven’t watched it already. Putin may have genuinely believed that the Russian military was a first-rate superpower because it was supposed to be if you believed official figures. It’s easy to put Scotch tape over a big ball of broken garbage during peacetime, but it won’t hold up under a stress test.

“Unlike twenty years of Russian policy”? I don’t really think so.

Just over twenty years ago, Russia literally razed Grozny to the ground and got away with not even a slap on the wrist because it was internationally recognized as their territory. Fourteen years ago, they invaded a sovereign country, Georgia, and forced it to withdraw from the territory of two separatist movements that were opaque Russian puppets (gee, why didn’t Russia support Chechnya then? Almost like they’re hypocrites or something). Eight years ago, they manufactured a war in the Donbas using phony “separatists” as a front for their naked attempt at a land grab and made an actual land grab by unilaterally annexing the territory of another country.

I will admit that even I was skeptical that z Russia would actually launch a full-fledged invasion until a few days before it happened. But in hindsight, the signs were all there. The thing that made a Ukraine invasion “unlikely” was purely the fact that it was fucking dumb even before it was nakedly obvious how shitty the Russian military was, not that Russia wasn’t more than willing to launch an invasion.",9c260600b34dc039d5dcc25e3460d175282ade1e,True,False,,,,,0,1654634630,,0,{},ibj4mn7,False,t3_v71m1t,False,False,t1_ibil729,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v71m1t/joe_biden_declassified_us_intelligence_regarding/ibj4mn7/,1654634649,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654605830.0,

&gt;The DNR somehow managed

""Somehow"" being entire Russian armor columns *mysteriously* appearing to save the day just as Donetsk was about to be retaken by Ukraine, and then Russia quite explicitly threatening overt escalation if Ukraine doubled down, forcing the farcical minsk agreements where Russia *pretends* that it isn't its troops that are elbow deep in the donbas from the very start. This isn't rocket science.


&gt;On the contrary, those are the poor bastards being put out on the pointy end.

*That's literally what I just said.*


&gt;Unfortunately, the putinists will operate on the theory that this will not affect them ultimately and that the sanctions will weaken over time, as they did with crimea, ORDLO, etc.

Bro? The 2015 sanctions *still stand* and *still* bite.


&gt;Is this the latest ""russia is out of X"" meme from the reddit neckbeards?

It's really cute to see people like you outright ignore Russia's drastic reduction in missile strikes coupled with them dragging out antequated, unguided pieces of shit like the X-22 that is dangerous even to the users.

And back in March it was how you'd deliberately misunderstand reports on Russian supplies. ""Three days of supplies left"" doesn't and never did mean ""they will run out of supplies in three days."" It means they literally only have that much *at hand* at any given time, and would be three days *if supply lines were severed.* And that's you know, *really bad* when you can't trust supplies to arrive in full, if at all. And then the *entire western front* collapsed in a panicked heap and you all pretended it was ""part of the plan bro"".

And yes, proximity fuzes have been almost entirely absent from the Russian side *from the start*. The munition in question has an overall very short lifespan of a few decades and have thus *literally decayed beyond usability*, which is why Ukrainian positions have been shelled pretty much exclusively with contact fuzes that are far less effective against trenches. The TOS-1 system is the closest Russia has to something that does that job, except it only had about 40 in total at the start of the war, and we've now seen numerous examples of them captured or destroyed, and they don't stand a chance against counter-battery.


&gt;No, not really.  This is nonsense

Yeah, so nonsense that it effectively killed the Armata project, huh? 🙄


&gt;Simply not true.  Is the aviation sector hurt?  sure.  But ""unable to have civilian airlines?""  no chance.

*Russia is literally incapable of getting spare parts for its planes*, and a huge section of its fleet are the *stolen* lease planes that will not get any service or maintenance equipment from the original companies. Are you aware of how bloody short the lifespan of civilian airliners are without regular, proper maintenance? Russian planes have already started to be turned away from *China* because there's no way China is going to deal with an airliner disintegrating midair in its territory.",e246e169203e1599e9f3d59b1088c2aab566018e,True,False,,,,,0,1654633355,,0,{},ibj1sw6,False,t3_v6wyy4,False,True,t1_ibiqbsi,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6wyy4/zelensky_explained_why_the_armed_forces_are_not/ibj1sw6/,1654633367,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654604555.0,

than carry out his military service. Now, as a moderate Social Democrat   
German chancellor, he opposes Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine but is   
reluctant to give Kyiv the full means to fight back. The likely result   
is that when the dust settles, Germany will be seen as one of the war’s   
losers.

Most of the people deported in dekulakisation purges were arrested to fill a quota.  

Your local cadre needs to send fifty kulaks. There is no concern for truth, there is no appeal or quality control. The quota must be filled. Kulak is a specific term applying to settlers transferred to what is now the Donbas under the tsars (I think Catherine the Great) who established a petit landlord position. In Estonia they likely didn't exist at any point, if they did they were likely gone when dekulakisation began.

This is where the trope of being taken for having more cows than your neighbours comes from. The richest peasant, though dirt poor and not ahead by much at all, is the closest you have to a kulak.

But hundreds of thousands were deported because the official wanted to rape their wife or was jealous of them since school days or just had to come up with another name for the list and didn't want to write the name of someone they did know and like.

Some deported were among the poorest and were just unlucky. The quota had to be filled, the terror was the point.

The defensive spot was so great that even the Wagner group refused to cross. 

The Ukraines tricked the Russians to push and take a crap ton of ground in that area. The Ukraine’s then sent a major push to the southern  flank and pushed the Russians back to the urban environment (this will force room to room fighting which is where the Russians seem to be lacking in points in accomplishing) the point of this isn’t for Ukraine to push past the new urban environment and towards the border. 

Instead they plan to keep the Russians there and trapped in the environment and have their newly positioned artillery pieces that they announced a day or two ago would be taking the defensive high ground I mentioned before. 

That high ground gives a perfect view of that entire area. Having precision artillery units with a great view and in an environment that prevents rapid retreats or repositioning means that the Ukrainians can inflict really strong arty strikes.

The Russian arty pieces are less accurate as seen time and time again. They are on a normal footing and have no ability to separate friendly and enemy apartment complexes in the urban environment meaning if they do launch rounds then they run the risk of friendly fire.

Russian propaganda is a well-oiled machine targeting many corners of Earth and being successful because there is no active campaign countering it. If you think that people know how shitty life in the Russian Federation is for a majority of people, you don't pay attention.

Let's not delude ourselves that we are crystal pure. Law is the rule within the union for its citizens. However, the EU trades with Saudi Arabia which is one of the most repressive states, paid Turkey to keep migrants away without asking questions, workers from North Korea are being employed at Polish docks, we buy cobalt from Congo's mines powered by child labor, consume a majority of our produces from sweatshops on another side of the planet, etc. We are not different in this to any other state, it is politics. The current conflict is not about ideological values, but about self-preservation.

We have already got a taste of orchestrated immigration when Lukashenko has made immigration its state business and imported migrants via travel agencies to Polish borders. The reaction? Some liberal media might have voiced the outrage at not honoring high values, but there was a minimal outrage among the population of member states.

The union and other states will have to eventually modify their commitments to Geneva's Refugee Convention because humanity does nothing about climate change and a large part of Earth will become uninhabitable, hence triggering a mass exodus (because who wants to raise their kid in 50° C hell). 

The EU is made of 447 million of people on 2% of Earth's land (for comparison, the USA has 329 million in 1.87% and RF 144.1 million in 17%). Just Nigeria, one of the states most threatened by climate change, has a population of 206 million alone.

The worsening conditions will lead to armed conflicts, and honoring the convention won't be sustainable. Geneva conventions have been regularly updated, let's remind ourselves a recent discussion about Russia calling its war a special operation and thus it not being war. There used to be a clause recognizing a war only if an invading state declares it. It doesn't anymore because the invader might abuse the agreement and avoid paying reparations by not declaring it. Thus, the definition was changed, so the act of invasion was the declaration of war itself.

All in all, I am glad I am not a politician who has to think of solutions to this nasty situation.",d9b1b39c572fcba04734f73e640a2087419a9c1f,True,False,,,,,0,1654629850,,0,{},ibitqjv,False,t3_v6sp9w,False,True,t1_ibigpbt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6sp9w/russian_ambassador_storms_out_of_un_meeting_after/ibitqjv/,1654629866,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654601050.0,

There FTFY.

The problem now is that the weapons are either very basic or given in small quantities. This means that for every Ukrainian that dies only two or three Russians die, possibly even less. We have seen that when Ukraine has a decent level of old Western weapons, this ratio (the ""kill ratio"") increases to about 10:1  (ten Russians dead for every Ukrainan killed).

The West needs to make an explicit target at least 100:1. That means supplying long distance stand-off munitions in large quantities. That means loitering HARM weapons to kill Russian radars. It means, instead of supplying Ukraine with NATO 1980s technology moving forward to the 1990s or early 2000s. Nothing that gives away NATOs adavntages, but at least Tomahawks and F-15As, which the Russians have already captured and so can't learn from, preferably though things like F-15Cs and somewhat modern AESA radars. That means M1A1s and Patriot batteries. That means Polaris or early Trident and Northern European diesel electric submarines.

With a kill ratio above 100:1 the Ukrainian war would be sustainable indefinitely and the demographic change would gradually transform Russian society.  With the right weapons this is achievable. Most likely, however, Russia would surrender long before the entire 17-50 male demographic was wiped out.",f9b62097bae13fb5c05d12615ea35a9a9b497d8b,True,False,,,,,0,1654629157,,0,{},ibis4d6,False,t3_v72e48,False,False,t1_ibikb8h,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v72e48/ukraine_must_not_be_pressured_into_a_bad_peace/ibis4d6/,1654629172,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654600357.0,

The scarier thing for Russia isn't their (fairly bad) personnel losses, but their considerably worse equipment losses.   It's getting to the point where they're starting to lose military capabilities — they're running out of guided bombs, they're running out of T-72s, etc, etc.

When you start to lose ""military capabilities"" you get into these horrible little checkmates where an enemy can (in certain ways) kill you with impunity.   Like, if your anti-air missile launchers get knocked out, all of a sudden, the enemy can attack you with aircraft with total impunity.   You can see a clear example of this earlier in the war, where Russia was doing missile strikes (fortunately, with really expensive cruise missiles Russia has a very short supply of) on Ukrainian cities.   What could Ukraine do about it?  Nothing.

The scary thing for Russia going forward is they're going to have an artillery disadvantage where Ukraine can hit them with guided artillery and rockets that are accurate enough to hit a vehicle one the first-ish shot, and can shoot a lot further than Russia's artillery.

There's already a thing where a lot of the guys in the trenches basically don't ever see their opponents.   They're there so that the enemy can't just run infantry past a position, but before either side tries to do that, they first try to kill off the enemy trench infantry by using their artillery, or drone strikes, etc, etc.   Thus far, defenders on both sides have had to hunker down and take the hits from the enemy shooting their artillery, because both sides were basically operating the same artillery with the same range.  If Ukraine starts getting a significant artillery advantage, this starts to become one-sided, where Russian trenchmen get shelled, and Ukrainians largely stop getting hit.

\------

Russia can keep throwing bodies at the problem, but it's going to get more and more suicidal for the guys being thrown in, over time.

The idea of it ""getting a lot worse"" is scary when it's already extremely bad.",8d4b533610c8e2493bce2442d547adf23c540498,True,False,,,,,0,1654628787,,0,{},ibir9r8,False,t3_v6u339,False,True,t1_ibhf0jw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6u339/russias_total_losses_as_of_june_7_2022_are/ibir9r8/,1654628805,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654599987.0,

You will see a lot of Slavic surnames around here. My parents were married in an ethnic Polish church but had their reception in a Ukrainian church hall because of my dad's personal connections to the Ukrainian community. Several of his friends and football team mates growing up were ethnic Ukrainian. My mother is a teacher and several of her students are first generation Ukrainian-Americans (parents are from the old country) who go to supplemental Ukrainian cultural schools to keep the language and culture alive. My mother has also had a couple Ukrainian refugee children in her class this year. Their older brothers and fathers left to go back and fight.

Personally, I'm a bit of history buff, but I'm no means an expert on Eastern European history. I understand that the Ukranians are a proud people from a beautiful country. I understand they have lived under the thumb of the Kremlin for centuries, facing deportation, multiple genocides, eraser of their culture, and other abuses. I also know that the country has a thousand year history of bloodshed, their soil soaked with the blood of countless despotic and tyrannical armies. I almost think that's the reason why Ukraine's fields are so black and rich for farming.

But I also know Ukraine isn't perfect. Corruption has been a systemic issue. They've only recently shifted more democratic. They have faced crippling poverty before the war. But their prosperity was stunted due to the Russians, and even before the war their motivation was easy to see. They *wanted* to be better. The Russians have only given them more motivation.

The DNR somehow managed.

On the contrary, those are the poor bastards being put out on the pointy end.

"" Russia is also basically out of proximity fuzes""

Is this the latest ""russia is out of X"" meme from the reddit neckbeards?  maybe this one is right. the last 10 or so of these we heard from experts didn't seem to be.

""And such a ""consolidation"" just means the sanctions literally never end or ease. ""

True.  Unfortunately, the putinists will operate on the theory that this will not affect them ultimately and that the sanctions will weaken over time, as they did with crimea, ORDLO, etc.

"" to kill Russia's modernization attempts. ""

No, not really.  This is nonsense.  What killed ""modernization attempts"" like... skolkovo?  superjet? was that they were shit + corruption.

""The current sanctions regime is literally leaving Russia unable to have civilian airlines, among many many other things.""

Simply not true.

No, he is not.

Calling out Scholz, his inactions and lies, his SPD network of corrupt appeasers, is certainly NOT something a troll would do.

A troll tries to cause instability, but not by putting on more pressure to do the right thing, but by doing exacytly what this guy is doing here: fighting the truth and silencing people who dare to speak up.

The West's division is not caused by people trying to correct it. But by people who accept it and even support the division. Like this guy does.

Nobody demands anything ""ridiculously exaggerated"". Scholz still hasn't delivered a SINGLE heavy unit. That's not an exaggeration. Just today his latest card trick has been called: The ring swap that was supposed to speed up delivery from Greece will actually cause a deliberate 2+ months delay.

Women don't give a care about abortion in 2022, like they did in 1973.   The reality of US governance is that elected officials find every way to screw the poor people to the benefit of the rich.  They've figured out that taking away abortion rights *only* affects *poor* women.  Every other pregnant woman  will take a vacation trip to Disneyland (in CA) or NYC.  Even teenagers with internet access will merely order mifepristone from Alipay.  

So you'll get more women voters that will vote for Democrats that support abortion rights, but they will be outnumbered by the wave of pissed off voters, in both parties and sexes, pissed off at the high gas prices, and inflation, that threaten to destroy their quality of life.  And that is because Democrats and Biden have **failed** to address those issues before November 2022.  Pretending to address those issues will probably not convince enough voters to keep Democrat legislators.

The vast majority of the weapons produced were for purposes of beating them in a war. At least that is what they told the taxpayers. This is as good as time as any to use them for what they were intended.

A growing by conquest Russia will cause defense budgets to explode even more both in the US and Europe if they are allowed to keep going. The current US administratin needs to consider the long term damage of this happening along with other factors as you've noted.

Some things are special cirumstances (like wars and lives) and more important than the next election. The last administration seemed to be okay with NATO going away and who knows what the next one will do. This adds extra incentive to help Ukraine win for selfish purposes ie there may not be an opportunity like this again.

This is also why the Russians/Putin always seem so confident. The US government looks like squabbling children and most of the time nothing ever gets done or it is dragged out forever. Overall it has started to look like a tiny minority of the country makes all of the decisions - not very democratic.

You have wild swings in Europe with at least 2 powers looking like Russia has some embarrassing video on them, at least one other is a dictator that can't get his hands on enough money and weapons and is on nobody's side. Most have had low defense budgets in the past also. So Russia looks at this and already has a huge advantage because they are not a democracy - no discussions just act. And they know just observing Europe and other western countries that things can change and they can wait if need be for the right time.

Given this climate, the Biden administration needs to make a decision and act alone if need be. It is fine and good to coordinate with other allied countries to help Ukraine with weapons, transportation and so on but the US is swimming in wealth in arms (relative to others) and needs to at some point just get a ton of stuff in Ukraine or just outside it so when they are ready no more delaying.

The whole business about US jets for example: training should have already commenced (pilots and maintainers) once it was determined that Ukraine will transition to NATO equipment and on any weapons with exception of something like nukes.

I am hoping that what looks like a meek scratching the surface of the last large military Ukraine bill (&lt;1B last week out of more than 11B available) is just them not announcing or maybe they have stuff on the way but because of the nature of the weapons they take longer or the shipping method is different/slower.

The last monthly meeting of all of the defense minister types from the 40+ Ukraine friendly countries; it seemed like things would really start moving then. Note: I really hope they are not allowing Turkey to attend these. This was right after Lend-Lease was passed. The Ukraine rep even said he would be reporting back on the use of the new weapons being sent as a result of this meeting. The next meeting is June 15. I will be curious if there will be much to report or if what is reported will be dire enough to get all allies moving with volume.

On the main 10:1 topic of this thread: no and it depends (different objectives, timing etc.). I believe Ukraine has the people if the equipment is there to arm them properly.

What they really need is the superior weapons advantage, in particular since they don't have air cover, stuff that outranges their enemy. Russia has just huge amounts of artillery that needs dealt with without decimating Ukraine's fighting force. It is crazy to expect the Ukraine forces to go charging at this huge pile of artillery that has good range of its own with guns and tanks that can be picked off. Russia also has no problem using the thermobaric weapon either. Ukraine has gotten some long range artillery to counter but nowhere near what is needed.

The HIMARS and M270 MLRS systems are the ticket (along with greater volume of long range artillery) but sending 3 or 4 once or once per month moving forward will just turn this into a very long slog with a lot more Ukraine people dying.  Plus, the longer it goes the more things can change internally for the allies and the opportunity may not be there in the future.

I actually believe all of these crazy verbal responses every time the US announces more weapons (they lost their minds over 4 HIMRS for crying out loud) are part of Putin's strategy to both slow down and mute both the quality and the volume of what is being sent - the real threat to his obectives. This 4 US HIMAR donation proves that his strategy is working because the US probably could have sent Ukraine 100 of them without being affected at all militarily. And the coked up Russian response to these 4 was them saying to themselves that's a relief but strongly publicly warning no more so the volume will continue to be muted.

I don't believe Putin has any intentions of sending nukes or even striking anyone in NATO at all. He fears NATO. His obectives are to genocide the Ukraine people and take their land. He'll start considering others when he's done. The only threat to this is the Ukraine people and western weapons and the superiority of the latter compared to his own is what he fears most  (hence the crazy responses) because you don't need near the amount of people then. That huge artillery advantage he has could be ravaged by longer range MLRS.",a7ab7a11033727c08d067fc20d42ffaab2510bab,True,False,,,,,0,1654622617,,0,{},ibictk9,False,t3_v6wyy4,False,True,t1_ibhxlvn,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6wyy4/zelensky_explained_why_the_armed_forces_are_not/ibictk9/,1654622634,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654593817.0,

While I never wanted kids and never planned to have them, I still support people wanting to have them. Especially if they are having trouble with conception, I could only show support and hope for them achieving their dreams of having a baby.   

I'll never have kids because I think that the world isnt in a place I'd want to bring my children into. I'll never have kids because I think that sometimes being a parent can get in the way of your own personal, albeit selfish, goals and dreams. I'll never have kids because its just not something I want to do and bringing a kid into the world when you dont want one is a crime against humanity. 


But no matter how badly I dislike or dont want children. I'd never equate someone's ability to conceive or have a child with their worth as a human being or consider them ""not even a man"" or ""not even a woman"" if they couldn't. You know why?

Kadyrov owes everything to Putin. But at the same time his popularity in Russia went down a lot and now is at about 17% in polls.

Why is it important? Even when KGB chose Putin as a Jelcyn successor, they've started to build his image. They've shown him as someone independent, effective, what is more important - completely disconnected from the Jelcyn family and inner circle. It was the most important thing, to show him as someone not involved in the current discredited politics.

Kadyrov would be the worst choice ever. Seen as Putin's friend. Fake, glittering with wealth, unpopular. From the KGBs point of view - he would be - in my opinion - seen as someone very hard to be contained and controlled and moreover - someone with priorities set far away from KGBs list. He might look as stupid, but he knows pretty well that his pure existence and well-being depends on Putin.

You claim that Silvoarchs hate Putin or want him dead because he caused them a lot of problems. Why do you think so? In my opinion Putin's decision to invade Ukraine was a purely desperate ""business"" decision. All of their aggressions in the last decades point either in the direction of protecting Russia's businesses (gas fields, oil &amp; gas pipes, warm water access for transportation of resources - it's more complicated but I really encourage to watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo6w5R6Uo8Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo6w5R6Uo8Y)) or, in some absurd directions of building Russian Empire. All of modern history (I recommend reading Putin's People, awesome book and eyeopener) of Russia tells us that Russia priorities are really set in building business and to keep some small elite rich. There is a lot of mentality and ideology in the background, but that's not what drives them, really.

I think, that they know pretty well, that decision was uneasy and controversial, but at the same time worth of the risk. Maybe. Putin will be replaced if they would realize, that he is not anymore the assurer of their interests. It's not an easy think, though. Even with discredited Jelcin, with all the corruption accusations against his family, they could not simply remove him forcefully. And he was really someone hated at end of his presidency. Putin is on contrary someone completely else.

Look between the lines. What's happening in Russia. His image is all the time backed up. There are some happenings, public demonstrations to support him, protests against are practically non-existing,. At the same time Putin does some purges in the FSB, he swaps generals without issues, does whatever he wants. He behaves like someone with a huge support from the ""deep state"". I think he has a full support from Silvoarchs at this point. They wouldn't probably support him if his reasons would be purely ideology based. They are not, that's just the narrative for the regular people.

Patrushev - well, it's more probable, but still. His popularity is non-existant. He comes from Putin's inner circle (what would compromise him if the narrative would be to turn the current tide and show Putin as someone crazy). I am pretty sure that in new narrative they would want again the leader who could be seen as someone new, independent.

I believe it can happen, that the Putin might be overthrown, but I don't believe that these guys even think about that possibility. It's unreal. They come from Putin's inner circle and such news - sorry - are fabricated to cause chaos. To cause uncertainty. Which, ironically could lead to the Ooverthrow :-)",f2e1af548715f83d9db397a07f2c6952831e0ba0,True,False,,,,,0,1654621327,,0,{},ibi9r6h,False,t3_v6esut,False,True,t1_ibi0v5i,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6esut/vladimir_osechkin_of_gulagunet_received_700_gb_of/ibi9r6h/,1654621346,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654592527.0,

&gt; Poland has signed a defense contract with Ukraine worth PLN 2.7 billion for the sale of Krab self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.

&gt; &amp;quot;Right now we are signing one of the largest, if not the largest, export defense contract in the last 30 years. This is the sale of weapons to Ukrainians, to Ukraine,&amp;quot; Morawiecki said.

&gt; Asked whether Ukraine does not intend to buy additional batches of Piorun MANPADS from Poland, Blaszczak said that &amp;quot;Ukrainians highly praise these weapons.&amp;quot; However, he confirmed the possible new deliveries of these missile systems to Ukraine, noting that the Polish Ministry of Defense will order these MANPADS for its own army.

Russia isn’t the problem, nor is the Ukrainian conflict. It’s about a declining US being willing to do anything to maintain its top ranking in the world economy and military.

As an American, I have a healthy distrust of our own government. Especially in matters of foreign policy. 

It’s a sad situation but I see that the Ukrainians are just being used as a tool by the Americans to fight Russia. We’ve made it clear that we’re never going to risk our own soldiers lives, but we will essentially give you weapons for free or almost free.

That goes for Biden and Trump. Trump unilaterally canceled a medium range missile peace treaty with Russia. That became effective March 2022. Coincidence?

And the news media on the left and the right is so focused on human interest stories about the war that no one is digging into the possible underlying macro economics.
The second N. Stream gas pipeline is somehow crucial to the whole situation.
Add in that the US is trying its hardest to use a Ukraine as the tool to isolate China further. And to lean on unaligned economy such as India.
And as I posted elsewhere on this Reddit, Making Ukraine a cause célèbre may have been a brilliant way of covering US weakness to do anything in the Arctic. 
It’s a brilliant though evil and cynical move on the part of our own politicians to exploit the situation like this.

&gt;Neglecting basic values ​​and, among other things, tolerating someone's right to kill and plunder with impunity will shake the whole skeleton of the meanings on which the whole construction rests. If you question them, every European country, sometimes every one, can remember that it was once offended, and we just have to wait for the right moment to restore ""historical justice."" Of course, there are laws and agreements, but laws can be rewritten. Russia's goal, both for the elites and the masses, is to return the world to its previous state, where everything is decided by power and interest.

&gt;There are nations where values ​​are perceived as the core of identity: ""We will never be slaves"", ""For your and our freedom"" - everything is easier there. As soon as a croissant with coffee in the morning becomes the meaning of life, a platform for compromises appears. Ukraine, obviously, will not compromise, and this creates in Euro elites something like irritation. Well, sorry. Someone has to remind Europe that it is Europe.

*07.06.2022 17:39*  
  
*Poland has signed a defense contract with Ukraine worth PLN 2.7 billion (about $650 million) for the sale of Krab self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.*  
  
*Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for State Assets Jacek Sasin and National Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said this during a joint press conference at the Huta Stalowa Wola steel mill on Tuesday, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.*  
  
*""Right now we are signing one of the largest, if not the largest, export defense contract in the last 30 years. This is the sale of weapons to Ukrainians, to Ukraine,"" Morawiecki said.*  
  
*He stressed that these weapons will be ""very important"" on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine.*  
  
*He noted that Ukraine receives funds for the purchase of these weapons partly from the EU and partly from its own budget.*  
  
*Sasin, in turn, noted that the contract is a ""record"" one for Poland as its value exceeds PLN 2.7 billion.*  
  
*""There has been no such contract in the Polish defense industry for the last 30 years,"" Sasin said.*  
  
*Blaszczak said that the war in Ukraine is not what many imagined in the 21st century, but a war as in photos and stories from World War II.*  
  
*According to him, artillery plays a key role in Russia's war against Ukraine. Therefore, Poland will rely on the development of artillery.*  
  
*Asked whether Ukraine does not intend to buy additional batches of Piorun MANPADS from Poland, Blaszczak said that ""Ukrainians highly praise these weapons."" However, he confirmed the possible new deliveries of these missile systems to Ukraine, noting that the Polish Ministry of Defense will order these MANPADS for its own army.*",89d13a2f3cb06bb33b2b5ddb3a7c671fe6232c11,True,False,,,,,0,1654620426,,0,{},ibi7ly3,True,t3_v71048,False,True,t3_v71048,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v71048/poland_signs_650m_defense_contract_with_ukraine/ibi7ly3/,1654620438,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654591626.0,

This is an issue that rarely gets mentioned- 
Given the high dollar value and demand for weapons, how can we eliminate chance for weapons diversion? 
It’s like whacks mole - whether Ukraine wins or loses - it will lead to  destabilization of other countries from weapons diverted from the Ukraine war. The US is handing out weapons, guns, ammo like candy. Given the private militias in Ukraine and the high risk of corruption such as in this news article, it is a legitimate concern to not over-ship weapons. 

The Afghanis will be most likely to keep the abundant cache of weapons left behind by the US. But post- war, millions of guns and ammunition rounds will be left over. Not to count leftover missiles and anti-tank rounds.

Arms sent to Ukraine will end up in criminal hands, says Interpol chief
Jürgen Stock urges members to cooperate on arms tracing as weapons will flood hidden economy when war ends
Kim Willsher

Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via Email
Weapons sent to Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in February will end up in the global hidden economy and in the hands of criminals, the head of Interpol has said.
Jürgen Stock says once the conflict ends, a wave of guns and heavy arms will flood the international market and he urged Interpol’s member states, especially those supplying weapons, to cooperate on arms tracing.
“Once the guns fall silent [in Ukraine], the illegal weapons will come. We know this from many other theatres of conflict. The criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,” Stock said.
“Criminal groups try to exploit these chaotic situations and the availability of weapons, even those used by the military and including heavy weapons. These will be available on the criminal market and will create a challenge. No country or region can deal with it in isolation because these groups operate at a global level.”
He added: “We can expect an influx of weapons in Europe and beyond. We should be alarmed and we have to expect these weapons to be trafficked not only to neighbouring countries but to other continents.”
Biden’s pledge to send rocket systems to Ukraine is no silver bullet
He said Interpol urged members to use its database to help “track and trace” the weapons. “We are in contact with member countries to encourage them to use these tools. Criminals are interested in all kinds of weapons … basically any weapons that can be carried might be used for criminal purposes.”

Ukraine’s western allies have sent shipments of high-end military weapons to Ukraine since the Russian invasion more than three months ago. On Tuesday, the American president, Joe Biden, announced the US would supply Kyiv with advanced missile systems and munitions. After the US pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021, following 20 years of war, huge amounts of often highly sophisticated military equipment was left behind and fell into the hands of the Taliban.",e968fdfa636c6d0f80bf572ee483a18afa530733,True,False,,,,,0,1654619507,,0,{},ibi5f59,False,t3_v6t9y3,False,True,t3_v6t9y3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6t9y3/security_service_of_ukraine_sluzhba_bezpeky/ibi5f59/,1654619525,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654590707.0,

If you knew history you would know that Prussia and Russia have mostly fought wars *together*, not against.

I can recall only one war where Prussian and Russian troops fought each other as Prussia supported the Austrian aggression in Slesia and Galicia and it was Prussia aiming to take territory out of Russia, that was the first austrian succession war.

The rest of the countries you list are borderline ridiculous and show again your limited knowledge of history. Pretty much every single war with austria has been started by austria, the wars with sweden have either been borderline stupid border defining wars or started by anti russian coalitions.

The kievan rus is even a more ridiculous example, it stopped existing 3 centuries before the russian nation even started existing. Ukraine has never existed till 1919 and the nation concept of Ukraine didn't even exist pre 19th century and it has always been part of austria/prussia/poland/russia and the various other khanates and other bordering countries.

There's no denying that Russian has been one of the biggest imperialistic countries in the world, looking at a goddamn map or the news is sufficient to know that without looking at history books, but trying to rewrite history making Russia appear the aggressor towards western and central european powers is straight ridiculous and a testament of history knowledge.

After the Tutsis were deposed, the Hutus enacted their revenge culminating in the Rwandan genocide. If the Belgians (and Germans) never colonized the Congo, this never would have happened.

It's true.  


....save that the belgian didn't put the tutsi in power cause they were whiter. They put them in power because they were already partially in power. Tutsi were historically richer than Huttu, thanks to their economic focus on cattle, where Huttus were poorer, but demographically more heavy, thanks to their economic focus of farming.

2/ How do each of them know that they are best of friends, and not just pretending to be so that they can be close to power?

3/ whilst all was well they may have been friends. With Putin in a poor position Patrushev &amp; Kadyrov are then also in bad positions. Putin losing power could mean their death if someone other than them gets in. Best thing to do is to kill Putin and take control.  That way, other contestants have less opportunity to kill Patrushev &amp;/ or Kadyrov. 

4/ If Patrushev gets in to power, he can not afford to allow Kadyrov to live.  Too dangerous.  Kadyrov will know this, so will be vying to kill Putin &amp; Patrushev.  

4/ If Patrushev &amp;/or Kadyrov kill Putin, they will need to frame another person.  If either one is seen to have killed Putin, they potentially leave themselves open to a revolution by the proletariat (controlled by other Silovarchs and oligarchs).

5/ The Silovarchs really want rid of Putin as he has caused them lots of problems.  This has meant they can’t steal as much from the people. These Silovarchs want someone else in power, but someone that they can control.

6/ The military and FSB mainly want Putin dead as they gave been caught out stealing so much that they have proven quite ineffective. Means they can get out of the Ukraine - unless they know they can make more money by continuing the war. After all peoples deaths don’t matter, as long as it is not them and their families.

7/. Because no person, or group of persons, can trust each other it makes it very difficult to kill Putin without there being some negative impacts, unless it can be proved that “someone else did it”.  Putins biggest reason for being alive still is down to no one trusting anyone else.  That is exactly what Putin wants.

2591,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"On March 2, member states of the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution that strongly condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine. The resolution, which was supported by 141 member states, affirmed that “any attempt aimed at the … disruption of the territorial integrity of a State … or at its political independence is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.” The resolution was an affirmation of the legal guardrails and norms that have guided international relations since the conclusion of World War II and the ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945.

One region stood out for its seeming ambivalence, however. While most African countries joined their global counterparts to stand up to Putin’s unprovoked brutality, 17 African countries abstained, with another eight choosing to not participate. One country even voted against the resolution, Eritrea, a totalitarian dictatorship. There were many reasons for the abstentions, varying from historical ties to Africa’s liberation struggles to the self-interest of regimes currently propped up by Russia and to those ideologically committed to nonalignment on the global stage.

But African leaders should have a more fundamental concern than these—at least, those who are committed to advancing peace and democracy. Putin is attempting to undermine the global order that has guided international relations for the better part of the last century. Building on Russia’s previous annexation of Crimea and parts of northern Georgia as well as its prior occupation of Ukraine’s Donbas region, Putin is taking a sledgehammer to the foundation of the once stable post-World War II order.

This attempt to normalize expansionist ambitions will have profound consequences for Africa. Would-be tsars across the continent—who, like Putin, have evaded term limits to stay in power indefinitely while eliminating their political opposition—are watching closely, asking if Putin can get away with this brazen overreach and flout the rules-based order, then why can’t they. It is a reasonable question to ask. At stake are established notions of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the independence of member states, which suddenly become more temporal, arbitrary, and open to violent contestation.

Perhaps the most eloquent defense of the existing order, premised on these foundational principles, came from Kenya’s permanent representative to the United Nations: ambassador Martin Kimani, who warned Putin and the Russian military to respect its border with Ukraine, using Africa’s own colonial past to highlight the dangers of stoking the “embers of dead empires.”

So what does a Russian-shaped international order look like for Africa?

A primary feature is the challenge to the inviolability of established boundaries. There are currently some 100 contested borders on the continent, most of them stemming from arbitrarily drawn colonial boundaries. These have, for the most part, been managed peacefully by successive African governments, rooted in a respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that were enshrined in the Charter of the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and later reaffirmed in the Constitutive Act of the African Union in 2001. Established during the postcolonial independence period, many African states were born out of a commitment to self-determination. Ironically, this is the central issue being contested today by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

If the lesson from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is that might makes right, then Africa’s political geography could be perpetually in dispute. In other words, if the overlapping security guarantees provided by both the U.N. and AU charters can be violated with impunity, then what is to stop African leaders who envy Putin’s aggressive brand of authoritarianism from following suit?

Already, we see this happening in some parts of Africa.

The volatile African Great Lakes region stands out for the fragility of its borders. The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, has become a target for exploitation by authoritarian leaders in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, officially in power since 2000, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, have routinely marched their troops and proxies as well as directed their allied rebel groups to seize Congolese territory, loot natural resources, and kill citizens with alarming impunity. In October 2021, Congolese authorities reported clashing with Rwandan troops, who allegedly occupied several villages before retreating. And as recently as March, the Congolese army presented evidence that the Kagame regime was actively backing a rebellion in eastern Congo. Disregarding borders is particularly precarious in the Great Lakes region because it carries with it the potential to reignite one of the most cataclysmic conflicts in recent history.

Similarly, Moscow has played a destabilizing role in Africa. Recent years have illuminated a “new scramble for Africa” as external actors seek to aggressively plant their politics, governance, and economic flags across the continent. Russia has been at the forefront of this predatory behavior by repeatedly propping up isolated and authoritarian leaders—most notably in Libya, Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan—to advance Moscow’s patently anti-democratic influence.

Through the deployment of shadowy and unaccountable mercenary groups, polarizing disinformation campaigns, election interference, and arms-for-resource deals, Russia has gained influence while fostering instability and the increased human rights abuses that ultimately result from it.

Russia has also fomented—both covertly and overtly—and been quick to support the many unconstitutional seizures of power recently witnessed in Africa. The spate of coups and increasing instances of African leaders scrapping term limits, for example, better suit Moscow’s vision of remaking the international order in its autocratic mold.

That a Russian-shaped order in Africa would be more oppressive is crucial to note since most of the 16 ongoing internal conflicts on the continent have deep roots in authoritarian forms of governance. None of Africa’s established democracies, in contrast, are in conflict. More authoritarianism, then, can be expected to yield more conflict.

Tolerance for predatory interstate behavior globally, moreover, will embolden elevated forms of repression domestically in African states. After all, if the enshrined principles of self-determination and popular participation are not respected in a high-profile instance, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, then what international actors can be compelled to penalize the intimidation or jailing of opposition leaders, the shuttering of independent media outlets, and the brazen rigging of elections in Africa? Growing autocracy would do a grave injustice to the 75 percent of Africans who regularly state that democracy is their preferred form of government. The inevitable repression that will result from an unfettered international order would also lead to a spike in refugee flows and internally displaced populations.

It took the trauma of World War II to compel the international community to unite, recognize, and sign onto the principles outlined in the U.N. Charter. Intrinsic to this global system—forged from hard-learned and costly experiences—was the importance of collective security to deter and push back against authoritarian bullies in Europe and elsewhere.

The Organisation of African Unity and later the AU adopted many of these core values. Indeed, drawing on its own hard-earned lessons from colonialism, the challenges of securing peace following the brutal wars of the 1990s, and the aftermath of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis, the AU rightly recognized the importance of action when faced with violations of such universal principles.

While often underappreciated and unevenly applied, the U.N. and AU frameworks provide a layer of international accountability against extralegal actions as well as a critical starting point to build the solidarity that is needed to address the challenges that the global community faces.

As Africans grapple with the more present and disastrous aftershocks of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is important to recognize the threat this form of authoritarian expansion will have on the continent if it is normalized. History shows us that impunity is contagious. And apathy in the face of imminent threat is foolhardy. The clear threats emanating from Putin’s worldview defy the principles that are central to an international order that both the U.N. and AU helped foster.",147ea406a0669be5a8fd9a465651bd549a2e4d7b,True,False,,,,,0,1654615758,,0,{},ibhwqg7,True,t3_v6ypg4,False,True,t3_v6ypg4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6ypg4/putins_world_order_would_be_devastating_for_africa/ibhwqg7/,1654615772,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654586958.0,

Why didn’t I find one? Because the only invasion of a country similar in size and scope to Ukraine in recent memory was the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was successfully concluded with the same amount of troops as Russia had deployed.  Anyone arguing that position would have had no data to back their assertion.

Now, I have seen many people say Russia needed more troops AFTER the war started, but they are still wrong.

Which a) doesn't come anywhere near how many vehicles Ukraine was destroying, b) there aren't enough Javelins in the world for that and c) nobody can build that many either. Ukraine claims to have 700,000 men by now. They don't need seven _million_ by any measure. 

The likely reason they're not launching a major counteroffensive right now is that it's not strategically wise to do so. Mobilization is ongoing. Deliveries of foreign weapons and training on them is as well. Meanwhile the Russians are still advancing, albeit slowly. The sensible course of action is to stay on the defensive as long as possible and wear down the Russians until they lose their offensive abilities. As long as Russia is suffering higher rates of attrition - which is likely as long as they're on the offense. Defenders have an advantage. Ukraine's ability to launch a successful counteroffensive will only grow. Launching a counteroffensive too early under those circumstances would increase the risk of failure, or in any case the losses of Ukrainian lives.

Just to take the simplest possible model, using the traditional 3-to-1 advantage for defenders. If the Russians attack and lose 3,000 men, the Ukrainians lose 1,000. But this means Ukraine now needs 9,000 fewer men to attack what's left of the Russian force. 

As long as the Russians are still trying to advance, Ukraine's main focus should be on wearing them down and inflicting maximum casualties. That's what a war-of-attrition is. That's why people like Arestovych are saying a major Ukrainian counteroffensive is probably a month or two away.",4978553c9eab7c7adbefb0b02b8cb22a81075cb7,True,False,,,,,0,1654615649,,0,{},ibhwhcv,False,t3_v6wyy4,False,True,t1_ibhqbcb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6wyy4/zelensky_explained_why_the_armed_forces_are_not/ibhwhcv/,1654615661,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654586849.0,

I think we have made **two miscalculations**.   
We have overestimated the strength of the Russian military. Despite huge investments in military equipment and the reopening of old Soviet bases, we have seen a very weak Russian military. 
It remains to be seen why this is. I think corruption may be one of the reasons.   
But the other miscalculation is we have underestimated the brutality and the ambitions of President Putin.  

The 3-rd miscalculation is NATO UNDERestimated the strength and commitment of the Ukrainian military and society that work as a single organizm.

Here is a (shitty and quickly written) rebuttal of the person you replied to:

(I was going to reply to that post first, that is why its written like that)

___

Even if we take you on your word and I where to accept that: Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Denmark or Finland are not western countries. (I do not)

You are still wrong about all the nations you mentioned.

France (A lot during the Napoleonic era. They attack France during the War of second coalition and then there is a shit ton of back and fourth like when Napoleon invades quite a bit later. Oh and they attack England during this period too, tho this was due to a treaty they had to sign with France and they did not fight much.)

Germany: A lot, but destroying Germany's control over the Baltic's is a pretty big one. (They are aggressors against several different western nations for control over this area. Denmark-Norway, Sweden and notably Germany.) Russia attacked several Germanic Territories. That they took them successfully does not mean it was not aggression against Germanic states when attacked.)

They attacked the Ottoman-French-English alliance in the Crimean war. 

Ofc the Russians do declare war on Austria-Hungary (and by extension Italy) during WW1. Whilst the world has decided Germany are to blame for WW1 I dont think its as black and white as all that. I would put the blame on 1st Austria-Hungary, then Russia, then Germany. But that is not the conventional history so I wont argue that. That would mean the only real true one you said are Italy.

2980,[],False,,humanlikecorvus,,,[],,,,text,t2_fv6jq,False,True,"As a mod of this sub, related chats and a close observer of this conflict, other conflicts involving Russian Federation disinformation etc. - you are pretty wrong there.

Russian Federation propaganda tries to generate schisms, instability, chaos etc. in the West. It more than once also ""supported"" positions there, which are seemingly counter the Russian point of view, it is not about spreading there narrative (that the Soviet Union mostly did) but to divert discussions, to split the West, to damage the West by causing chaos.

E.g. short ago we had a bot-network on reddit, which we could highly suspect to be an actual Russian disinformation operation, of which around half of the accounts whined about Russophobia in the West, and the other called Russians subhumans and demanded more or less, that they are all slaughtered.

With BLM we saw about the same, Russian disinfo ops posing as well as hardcore and bordline racist, overly stereotypical and mad pro-BLM accounts and on the other side as white supremacy accounts.

&gt;Troll farms are not spreading information that encourages Germany to deliver more military aid, they are doing the opposite.

That's not the goal naturally, the goal is to deepen the around 50:50 split in the German opinion about that topic and radicalize both sides so that unity is destroyed and the discussion is derailed, and to divide NATO in roughly the same way.

There is also a big difference there, with just encouraging Germany in a constructive way, to do more - which is justified and a good idea - and to call Scholz and Merkel Russian assets, say they are as bad as Hitler and or even blame that on particular German genetic characteristics. With the second, you won't actually support Germany doing more, but you actually make it much more difficult to get support by those who have no strong position already in the German population.

&gt;What you are effectively saying is that Russian troll farms pressured Germany into supplying heavy weapons.

If you demand something ridiculously exaggerated, in particular if it is actually impossible, you indeed don't pressure Germany into doing more, but in the end you support those, who want to deliver less - they can always say, hey, they demanded we deliver current version main battle tanks, we can't do that, we don't have them, it is not responsible to do so, nobody else does. And you divert the debate away from the constructive discussion, of what could realistically be delivered and you actually reduce the pressure there.

Same with all the claims that Germany delivered nothing or did nothing for Ukraine. That's obviously false and can be demonstrated as being false - and it totally diverts the discussion from the important points. Then people discuss if Germany delivered zero or 1000 or 10k anti-tank weapons, instead of discussion what could be delivered in addition realistically in the near future. 

&gt;It's very clear that Germany is only supplying heavy weapons (allegedly) as a result of massive pressure from other countries. They were essentially shamed into it.

Not really. Looking at the current media coverage, and what we know about what happened behind the closed doors, the most likely reason is that Scholz is always following what others do. German followed the Dutch with the PzH2000, it followed the US with MLRS and so on. Also pressure by the US, UK etc. indeed probably also helped. 

If Spain now actually delivers Leopards to Ukraine and if Germany gives the approval, that might also be another tipping point for Scholz to deliver more heavy weapons to not stand behind much.

\- The low share of support for heavy weapons comes from a mix of fear to be dragged into an atomic war and a general sceptisicm that (especially german) weapons help to shorten any war, and the view that we don'Ät deliver to conflict zones.

There you will find engrained radical pacifist tendencies which to overcome is quite a struggle for a country causing war left and right last century.

This is unfortunatley heavily overexposed on the fringes left (We shouldn't, because the Russians helped end Nazi Germany) to the right (We shouldn't because it's not our war and our people suffer) - tbf both sides also fueled by russian psyop and money. But that's fringe.

The second one is the overwhelming acceptance that we misjudged Putin and that our strategy of intertwining (economical) relationsships would help preventing eescalation. That was a total failure and everyone accepts that by now. But still...you have to overcome a failure of such proportion.

Thirdly - the call for german leadership in Europe always was very uncomforting for Germans. We do not WANT to lead (anymore). But responsibility calls and we have to accept that we need to play a different rol. Still trying to figure out that one.

I’m looking at the current situation with 20/20 hindsight; this is literally why we study history. Look at the America South; it’s been 160 years since the Civil War and they still haven’t fully recovered from the effects of the war. I think the best example of the lingering effects of colonialism is the Rwandan genocide, which has its roots in colonialism. Long story short, the Belgians had a hard time recruiting Belgians to work in the Congo, so they decided to use the tried and true colonial tactic of dividing and conquering by playing the tribes off of one another. The Belgians held the Tutsis in higher regards than the other tribes bc they were taller, lighter skinned and had more European features (thinner lips, longer, pointier noses) and so they used them as the local police force. Up until that point, there wasn’t any animosity between the Hutus and the Tutsis, but the uplifting of the Tutsis (who were a minority in the area) and the atrocities they were forced to commit at the behest of the Belgians, fostered an animosity that lingered throughout the tenure of Belgian rule and continued after the Belgians left and installed a puppet government with the Tutsis as the political elite. After the Tutsis were deposed, the Hutus enacted their revenge culminating in the Rwandan genocide. If the Belgians (and Germans) never colonized the Congo, this never would have happened. This is true all areas that were colonized by the Europeans. I get the impression that your mind is already made up, but if you want some more insight into why most former European colonies are still poor, here’s an excellent [video](https://youtu.be/XXhEjvWDuds) why Mexico is still poor and big surprise, it has to do with colonialism.",3e8e31a45af3d144cc83aa5561869e459d39bb75,True,False,,,,,0,1654607439,,0,{},ibhf2gg,False,t3_v5b26w,False,True,t1_iba69fy,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5b26w/dont_romanticise_the_global_south_its_sympathy/ibhf2gg/,1654607453,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654578639.0,

&gt;Ukraine will handed to Russia on a plate when Trump wins the 2024 election

Roe V. Wade. 

November isn't a guaranteed victory for Republicans, especially since they fucked around on fossil fuels and formula, but that will inform 2024. There's a lot of noise in the polling right now, but this election is going to see higher turnout from dems just because of Roe, and I know some conservative women in the defense industry who are *all* flipping Dem, because they'll pay higher taxes if it means not being seen as brood mares, and not having access to abortion is a threat to their careers.

You're 100% right about a lot of the fundamentals here, but also, Biden does have a clear plan.

And the people he's targeting - especially in certain blue collar industries that are going gangbusters and have turned out to be shaky democrats, we're talking unions here - are folks who do vote.

The problem is that Democrats are bad at politics. 

They could have framed all of this to their advantage and for some fucking reason chose not to.

But I'm also fairly certain Trump is over. His guys tended to lose this primary season.

And if you look at the Republican leadership who never liked Trump, there are a lot of powerful forces that will coalesce.

Remember when the Bernie folks complained because all of the people crowding the field dropped out and endorsed Biden the same week?

If Trump runs again, I'm not sure he'll win. Republicans tend not to back losers, no matter if they lie about losing or not, and Trump was rejected by the American people. I would hope it's a Ben Sasse or Liz Cheney type, a republican I can live with, and not a DeSantis. 

But I find that unlikely.

The thing is, I don't think Putin and Russia hold out economically until the 2024 elections. There's a lot you can do in a short term emergency. Most nations can deal with a year of extreme sanctions. 

But the hardships that are coming are going to be relatively extreme for Russia, especially as they start to run out of repair parts for industry.

&gt;In general, the battle in the Donbas is more politically significant for Russia than it is for Ukraine. Ukraine can afford to trade territory for attrition, and hope to retake it afterward. This has been the basis of Ukraine’s strategy since the start of the war. The Russian military has a structural problem with force availability, and is not designed to sustain war of this scale at ‘peace time’ strength. Stopgap solutions can extend Russia’s staying power in this war, but not resolve those fundamental challenges. Hence, even though the local military balance in the Donbas appears favorable to Russia, the overall trends in the military balance still favor Ukraine. That is a conditional assessment, based on the current situation, and the assumption that Ukraine receives sustained military support, along with other forms of battlefield relevant assistance from the West.  
&gt;  
&gt;Predicting battlefield outcomes is often a fool’s errand. It overemphasizes tactical events, rather than strategic outcomes. Few things are contingent as armed conflict, and the turning points in a war are often best seen in hindsight. During operational pauses, or lulls in fighting, it will be tempting for observers to declare a stalemate. Yet this war is likely to become protracted, as such wars often do.",0d41522688e53150269348b9f90d345cd59df2fd,True,False,,,,,0,1654606515,,0,{},ibhdds2,True,t3_v6uqj0,False,True,t3_v6uqj0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6uqj0/the_russiaukraine_war_100_days_in_michael_kofman/ibhdds2/,1654606528,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654577715.0,

And any public person, especially politician, even mumbling about it should cause as much shock.

I am mind blown that some people would even go there. If Putin is not stopped now by any possible mean, he will do it again later. Concessions won't lead to a peaceful world, it will delay the moment we HAVE to say stop and weaken us.

*In Siverodonetsk, Luhansk region, the situation is currently stable, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have strengthened their positions and are holding their ground in the city against the Russian onslaught.*  
*Siverodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk reported the news on the air of the national telethon, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.*  
  
*""The situation in Siverodonetsk is stably difficult. Our Armed Forces have strengthened their positions, holding the city and the ground they have regained. But at the same time, the fighting does not subside. The orcs are deploying more and more forces, plenty of artillery units are concentrated here, lots of equipment. The enemy is carrying out assault attempts, trying to push their way forward, while we are stopping them,” the mayor said.*  
  
*He stressed that the Ukrainian Armed Forces ""are doing their best"" to defend the city.*  
  
*Read also: Situation in eastern Ukraine: Enemy shelling entire line of defense, Ukrainian army repels ten attacks*  
*According to Striuk, the invaders seek to achieve at least something, to gain at least some significant victory, because Siverodonetsk is the administrative center of Luhansk region, so ""it has a symbolic meaning,"" just as the actual regional center.*  
  
*As reported, Russian troops are trying to establish full control over Luhansk and Donetsk regions, but to date this goal has not been achieved.

So once Big Man is finally out, unless he manages to appoint some anointed successor like in the Empire days - the whole thing collapses as a bunch of power-hungry nobodies, essentially, start squabbling over who gets the juiciest cuts from the carcass. 

Kasparov, Navalny - doesn’t matter how much they hate Putin and how much the West loves them - they’re complete outsiders and nobody would listen to a word they have to say. 

Of course “free and open elections and the people decide” in Russia is a complete joke so I won’t even go there.

My guess is one of his loyal henchmen is the heir presumptive but they won’t command the loyalty of everyone the way Putin does and will be deposed and replaced in short order by someone like them and so forth until someone *more* ruthless kills everyone else to be unopposed. 

I just hope that whatever’s left of Russia after a few years of this is just a muddy puddle inhabited by alcoholics and pensioners and thus not a threat to anybody.

But where the boundaries of this war are is tricky. EU is totally on Ukraines side for example militarily and in fact Russia is fighting to keep it out of the EU. Lots of weapons and Ukraine is getting a few billion of month from them to do this.

&gt;  any peace agreement must be negotiated between Putin and Zelenskiy, showing “due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.

What Macron is saying is that the peace treaty of Versaille was a failure because it left an angry and humiliated Germany which was still able to build up it's weapons. If you look on this forum you will see repeated articles proposing breaking up Russia with nobody answering the question: how? It's reasonable to say that there just has to be an acceptance that, unless they use nuclear weapons or attack a NATO country Russia is likely to survive this war and will continue to be able to trade with, for example, China no matter what.

Once Russia gives up in Ukraine, the priority should be on ensuring that Russia stops developing it's military further whilst giving Russians a future that doesn't involve endless wars. Prioritizing humiliation in a treaty over military defeat on the battlefield is likely to cause needless problems. 

I don't fully agree with all of Macrons thinking, in particular I think it disregards Russia's ability to just move on in propagand from almost anything and assumes that Russians think in a logical way, remembering past humiliations when in fact the general Russian public is much more shaped by propaganda however I don't think this is nearly as bad a way of thinking as it's portrayed.",86402d61cf85b40bbcf85a0292b4b2e486426452,True,False,,,,,0,1654599663,,0,{},ibh2sam,False,t3_v6qji7,False,True,t1_ibh1tkp,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6qji7/the_head_of_the_svr_foreign_intelligence_service/ibh2sam/,1654599675,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654570863.0,

&gt; &amp;quot;You are afraid to be judged by society. And when your state becomes the one who bullies you, it&amp;#039;s just absurd.&amp;quot;Now Russian propaganda is trying to discredit people who speak out against the war, by outing them.

The Caesar is basically just a towed artillery put on the back of a truck. It operates literally the same as a M777...obly that it can drive without support. For a Caesar you can use crews trai ed on soviet towed artillery and immediatly use it.
Its a massive difference to an enclosed system like the PZH2000 that is more similar to training a MBT crew then artillery.

There arent going to be any new PZH2000 so I think training to properly use them tskes absolute precedence instead of immediatly sending them and losing them 5 minutes later do to wrong usage.

If the german armys trainers using these vehicles for over 20 years say they need time to train ukranians on it then iit is necessary. Im sorry but I value military opinions in that regard more then the average user of this subs opinion.

And the Ukranian war isnt going to end in 2 weeks, apart from 1 area its literally no movemeant and trench warfare. These arent AK rifles. Eather you do it properly or you waste valuable ressources for short term gain that cant be replaced.

Economically, 18% of their exports go to the US and 14% to the EU.

In terms of national security, they are members of [The Quad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral_Security_Dialogue), along with the US, Australia, and Japan (who all imposed sanctions on Russia). While the EU is not a member of the quad, they have been to shared summits, and the EU is taking more of an interest in the Indo-Pacific.

&gt; I can follow his argument, although I'm not sure I would argue the same way in his place.

Same. They are trying to have their cake, and eat it too. I still agree with Peter Zeihan that if they do want reliable partners in terms of their own security in the Indo-Pacific, they should be a reliable partner as well.

&gt; which do have enough of genocidal Partners on their own...just with more oil

Fair point, but we at least *try* to not depend on them too much, and are making a sacrifice to wean ourselves off Russian oil and gas.

Even China is refusing to bust sanctions, and while they increased their oil imports, they also suspended some gas exploration projects for a time.

&gt;Those who do fight on the front lines have done a great deal to show the world that the Russian military is a lot less scary than it once seemed, as it let column after column get shot to pieces and failed to achieve objectives against the more lightly armed Ukrainians.  
&gt;  
&gt;Part of it comes down to training. Taras Chmut, a former Ukrainian marine and head of the Come Back Alive foundation, said about 50-60% of Russia’s armed forces have below-average training, with roughly 30% having average training and only about 5% having above average training.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In general (the training) leaves much to be desired,” agreed Mikhailov. Much of training “is done halfheartedly, the army never prepared for the war it was about to embark on — remember, it came as a surprise for most of the lowest ranks.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Airborne troops and marines, who comprise the “constant readiness troops,” were better prepared but still not enough for a war like this, he added. Low pay, corruption and hazing continue to be problems for the Russian military, according to the OCCRP’s April report.",31e562b128cbcc95414f9ca932f98fd86dd8d989,True,False,,,,,0,1654595992,,0,{},ibgyeua,True,t3_v6rgwz,False,True,t3_v6rgwz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6rgwz/portrait_of_the_invader_understanding_the_russian/ibgyeua/,1654596008,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654567192.0,

From another comment I just posted:

&gt; If they want to be partners with the US so the US can help them contain China, they should definitely not be helping the US' foes.

Peter Zeihan made a good point in one of his videos. India is not really used to being a member of a coalition. While the US has been at the forefront of building coalitions (Bretton Woods, NATO, Quad, etc.), India is relatively new to international geopolitics.

Right now, they are taking a shitty, self-serving approach and throwing their partners under the bus. I very much think the US and EU should put them in their place.

&gt; I’m the world’s largest democracy.

Which doesn't mean shit, IMO. Either they are partners, members of a coalition, and actually stand for democracy, or they stand with a [genocidal dictator.](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/27/europe/russia-ukraine-genocide-warning-intl/index.html)

Driving a tank is like the least important part to learn and both ways are easy to be trained on after a while. Also you forget most soviets didnt have cars but a lot knew how to drive a tractor for farming. Tractors and soviet tanks had similar drivibg systems, there is a rrason tanks were produced in the same factories as tractors.

So for a soviet citizen it is easy to drive a soviet tank because most already know the driving system .

And ATGMs were used by both sides and were equally easy. Same with Panzerfaust/RPG type of weapons.

What takes time to learn on a tank crew are the commanders job, the gunners job is wa depending on targeting system complexity and the general mechanic aspect of maintaining the tank.
Soviet tank design didnt bother with maintanance.

Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.

The report was published and publicly accessible. The current government of Poland took it down (though it remains mirrored).

I even think that it may not have been worth taking the regular soldiers captive if it was inconvenient (prior to Geneva conventions perhaps), and they were executed, whereas the nobs and officers would be taken to prison for later negotiations, ransom, etc.

So it is my impression that while the regular men died in the awful meatgrinder that is war, the commanding officers were often scot free of the consequences. They would get released, get a medal, and commit countless more men to the slaughter.

*The UK is sending its first long-range missiles to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, despite a threat from Russia to the West.*  
  
*Ben Wallace said the M270 multiple-launch rocket system will help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.*  
  
*The government has not confirmed how many weapons will be sent, but the BBC understands it will be three initially.*  
  
*The decision comes after the US announced last week it was also supplying a rocket system.*  
  
*The move by the US to send its own M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) has already angered Moscow and on Sunday Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to expand the list of targets Russia will attack in Ukraine in response.*  
  
*What weapons has the UK already given to Ukraine?*  
*How long can Western unity over Ukraine hold?*  
*The UK government said the Ukrainian military will get training in the UK on how to use the launchers.*  
  
*The multiple-launch rocket system can fire 12 surface-to-surface missiles within a minute and can strike targets within 50 miles (80km) with pinpoint accuracy - far further than the artillery Ukraine currently possesses.*  
  
*Mr Wallace said the UK was taking a leading role in supplying Ukrainian troops with the ""vital weapons they need to defend their country from unprovoked invasion"".*  
  
*He said: ""As Russia's tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine.*  
  
*""These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against the brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin's forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.""*  
  
*The UK and US have led the way in supplying weapons to Ukraine, but giving it advanced long range rockets marks a significant shift, said the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale.*  
  
*It is also a recognition that Ukraine is struggling to compete against Russia's vast artillery arsenal, he added.*  
  
*Last week, Washington said it would supply four HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to Ukraine - following receipt of guarantees they would be used for defensive purposes only and not to strike targets inside Russia. The same restriction applies to the use of the UK's M270 system.*  
  
*In an interview on Russian state TV on Sunday, Mr Putin said: ""In general, all this fuss about additional arms supplies, in my opinion, has only one goal - to drag out the armed conflict as long as possible.""*  
  
*The Russian leader said that if missiles with longer ranges did arrive in Ukraine, his country would ""draw appropriate conclusions"" and ""strike at those targets that we are not striking yet"".*  
  
*The warning came as explosions shook parts of Kyiv on Sunday in the first assault on the capital city for weeks, while fierce fighting for control of key towns and cities in the eastern Donbas region continues.*  
  
*Russia refocused its military efforts on the Donbas at the end of March after pulling back from the Kyiv region.*  
  
*Some of the fiercest fighting is currently in the eastern city of Severodonetsk. Capturing the city would deliver the Luhansk region to Russian forces and their local separatist allies, who also control much of neighbouring Donetsk. The two regions form the heavily industrial Donbas.*  
  
*On Sunday, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said he had visited front-line troops in the eastern Donbas region to the city of Lysychansk and the town of Soledar.*  
  
*The UK has also delivered more than 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons - known as Nlaw - which analysts believe have been critical to Ukraine driving back Russian ground assaults since the war began.*  
  
*Other weapon systems delivered by the government include short-range Brimstone 1 missiles, Mastiff armoured vehicles and Starstreak missile air defence systems - with the overall military support to Ukraine costing £750m so far, the government said.*  
  
*Several other countries have pledged to send advanced weapons to Ukraine. Germany has promised to send its most modern air defence system - the Iris-T - to enable Ukraine to shield an entire city from Russian air attacks.*  
  
*Support for war crimes investigation*  
*Meanwhile, a specialist team of lawyers and police officers will be offered to assist the chief prosecutor investigating alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary Dominic Raab announced on Monday.*  
  
*The offer will include a Metropolitan Police officer stationed in the International Criminal Court in The Hague, in the Netherlands - who will provide the ICC's prosecutor Karim Khan with greater access to British police and military expertise.*  
  
*Seven lawyers experienced in international criminal law will be offered to help uncover evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine and prosecute those responsible.*  
  
*The ICC has already begun an investigation that may target senior Russian officials thought to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.*",afa1e1df4afdb6507fb0ff1221fd407ccb9efb39,True,False,,,,,0,1654589947,,0,{},ibgs1co,True,t3_v6q0ml,False,False,t3_v6q0ml,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6q0ml/uk_to_send_ukraine_m270_long_range_multiplelaunch/ibgs1co/,1654589963,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654561147.0,

Those same MLRS systems destroyed over forty infantry battalions and supporting units during the invasion of Iraq in under 72 hours. 

The Russians have between 90 and 100 BTGs in Ukraine.  Once the Ukrainians get up to speed on the new MLRS systems and other NATO systems, in early to mid-July, or sooner, we will be looking at a very different situation by the time August rolls around.

The Ukrainians are not there to ""bleed"" the Russians. They are there because once the war ends, there will need to be a negotiated settlement. If they are not present in these territories, it will be difficult to take them back during negotiations.

They would rather bleed for the city now and sacrifice men now because it will be difficult to take them back later. Most Ukrainian offensives have gone about as well as the Russian ones. Both sides are stronger defensively than offensively. 

Zelensky and others are stressing the importance of this particular city, not because it is some kind of trap, but because losing territory in Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts will make future negotiations more complicated. 

There is not much territory from Luhansk Oblast left. This particular city is in Luhansk Oblast. It's basically the last major claim the Ukrainians have to that region.

Ukraine goal is use this city as a meat grinder for the Russian military. Russia moves in, Ukraine lets them move in, Ukraine leaves some forces behind to harass the Russians and keep them off their feet. Once Russians have moved in, Ukraine pushes them out killing Russians in the person. After Ukraine has taken enough of the city they start withdrawing, giving their men some rest as the Russians re-engage. I suspect we will hear alot about this city.

We know something about how Russian military works, they operate from top down, they've been ordered to take this city, and they will throw everything they have at it.

As for reparations, after ww2 Germany paid reparations by surrendering land, industry, intellectual property and forced labour.

The video is worse and shows what he is really thinking.

Now, note at 45 seconds into the video he says this: ""Well, then (it's as if people are asking) will they be speaking Russian there is Ukraine. Well, again, we don't know. Well, half of Africa speaks French, half of Africa speaks English by the way. In fact, it comes down to how, so to say, economically attractive we can make it. ...""

So, he doesn't give a shit about Ukrainian language or culture. He is saying, so what if Ukrainians speak Russian! Even African countries don't speak their own languages and, you know, no big deal!""

Take Mikhail Gorbachev for instance. In the eyes of the Russian people he shirked his responsibilities and willingly allowed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. To the Russian people who lived through the era of Soviet greatness he was the cause of their demise, who ushered the end of Russia as a great world power and the man who brought on the decade of lawlessness. That cultural memory is still strong, and Russia yearns to return to the era where they were a formidable power. That is why a man like Putin leads the nation.

View a country's leader as a reflection of the people and one can begin to understand why things are as they are. In the minds of the Russian people they are still holding out for someone who will return them to an era when times were great. They would reject a man like Kasparov for who he is.

4367,[],False,,Astalano,,,[],,,,text,t2_ccdj6,False,False,"Yes, but let's just review some basic facts

\- This is an artillery war. You don't want to get too close.

\- But you can get closer for accuracy, yes, but also to shorten the time between receiving a call or a signal and responding with artillery. Let's say for the M777, which has a muzzle of velocity of 827 m/s. It has an effective firing range of 21km, but can be extended up to a maximum of 40km. Now, this isn't completely correct, but let's assume for the sake of simplicity velocity stays the same, which it doesn't, but okay, also factoring in gravity, etc. It would take about 48 seconds to impact the target. At 20km, that's around 25 seconds. So let's say, roughly, 30 seconds at 20km, 1 minute at 40km. In a minute someone may move position or get out of the way of your next salvo, depending how they are spaced during firing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, 20km, for me, is good enough. Getting that down to 12 seconds at 10km, I don't buy that it's worth the risk of putting your artillery that close to the frontline. 

Also, just keep in mind, this is a shoot and scoot artillery war. For artillery like M777, which is static, more or less, you can't exactly fire and get the hell out of the way in a hurry. You have to get un-deploy it, load up the ammo again, get the guys in the trucks, hook it up to be towed. It's a lot of work.

Then you have stuff like the French Caesar, with a muzzle velocity of 895 m/s and a max range of 50km with certain types of ammunition, but it's also on its own vehicle and can be easily moved. The effective range depends on a lot of things, like availability of the ammunition which can reach those maximum distances. 

I don't really think it's worth putting your Caesar's literally in Lysychansk, when you can just park them 20km away at the very least or even further.",49f910e8cc7cd020894f2063f4d47d7ee7d8e151,True,False,,,,,0,1654583306,,0,{},ibgkn1h,False,t3_v6maqb,False,True,t1_ibgiezh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6maqb/ukraine_update_70_of_severodonetsk_is_back_under/ibgkn1h/,1654583317,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654554506.0,

Translation:

Dear subscribers and guests of the channel! Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting via videoconference with the participation of Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei Naryshkin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev, FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov and several other people. Questions of foreign policy were discussed. In particular, Putin expressed regret and lamented the refusal of the Chinese comrades to help with the circumvention of sanctions. Initially, Putin had high hopes for Chinese help and had good reason to do so. The Chinese leadership, however, even before the war, made it clear that assistance in circumventing sanctions, if any, would be fast and large-scale. But firstly, no one expected that the war would not go according to plan and Ukraine would put up fierce and effective resistance, and secondly, no one expected that the West would impose such tough and voluminous sanctions. During the meeting, Putin expressed his personal dissatisfaction with Xi Jinping and the entire Chinese leadership in general in harsh and obscene terms. Also, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov received his portion of negativity from the president, on whom Putin laid part of the responsibility for the failure in negotiations with China. And when Lavrov began to explain the reasons why his visit to Serbia did not take place, Russian President Vladimir Putin broke down and interrupted him, calling him ""an asshole"" and ""a complete faggot."" However, there is nothing extraordinary in what happened, not in public Putin allows himself to communicate in this style with some people and Lavrov is included in this circle.

The participants of the meeting also noted small, but promising successes in expanding the possibilities to effectively influence European politicians. Thus, the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Naryshkin, described the opportunity to influence several key European politicians with a colorful metaphor: ""we hold them by the balls, very gently, but with a very cold hand."" Putin liked this expression very much and later he repeated it several more times, quoting Naryshkin. In general, Patrushev ended the meeting on a positive note, promising a quick breakthrough in circumventing sanctions with the help of India and a number of countries in the Asian region.",0f729412af3920660ce5b65d33140e26b1586c22,True,False,,,,,0,1654583229,,0,{},ibgkjoi,True,t3_v6od07,False,True,t3_v6od07,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6od07/general_svr_channel_putin_rages_at_china_for_not/ibgkjoi/,1654583241,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654554429.0,

4434,[],False,,laundry_writer,,,[],,,,text,t2_3i8g46xh,False,False,"Putin is being as warm and cuddly as can be for an invader, when compared to, say, how Hitler rolled into Poland. But at the end of the day, he is trying to keep in an affair between Russia and Ukraine, with the stronger winning in the end, as such territorial things are supposed to go. Yes, the invasion was wrong, but it was wrong in the same way as walking up to punch someone in the face is wrong. It is still supposed to be a fight between two parties, and allowed to reach its natural conclusion with a winner and a loser. Putin knows that Ukraine cannot destroy the earth in a fit if it gets angry about being eaten by a bigger animal.

Zelensky, on the other hand, knows that a confrontation between Nato and Russia will be a no-win situation for Russia. And in a no-win situation, the only option is to make sure that if you are going to lose then your opponent must also lose. By calling for Nato intervention, or the imposition of a no-fly zone, Zelensky is doing the only thing he can. He cannot win against Russia. And so, the only way to ensure that when he loses, Russia also loses, is to spark the confrontation between Russia and Nato that will take Putin down with him.

In short, Putin is taking action to conquer a neighboring territory. Bad Putin! Just doing what conquerors have always done throughout history, but okay, bad Putin! But Zelensky is trying to save his nation by involving other nations, whose business this is not, when he knows it would result in a conflict that will result in an even greater loss of life across the board. And so, it doesn't matter who is right or wrong, or who started this, all that matters is how is there the least loss of life right now. We can't go back in time, so we can only consider from this point on.

Putin will not stop, because he can't. He will lose all chance of remaining in power if he does, not to mention never achieving whatever it is he wants in the end. So no option there. Zelensky, however, has amassed a world following and great name recognition. He could come out of this with even more personal power elsewhere in the world, and stop all of this by surrendering and abandoning Ukraine. He would be fine in exile. Better than before even. More Ukrainians would live, as would Russians, and others.

But the reason Zelensky gets my respect, and represents my chosen side of this conflict, is because he is sticking to his guns. He wants Putin to suffer, and doesn't care if it breaks the world. This is how he is supposed to feel and act. He wants to save all his people, and their freedom, and doesn't care whether or not the world dies in the attempt to do so. He has more action hero in him than I thought, and there is nothing more respectable than saying ""If I go down, you go down too.""

So, in driving so hard to win and keep his peoples freedom, he is driving the world closer to what is a potentially world ending confrontation. He has more in common with Putin than he might like to admit publicly, because neither of them will stop until they get what they want or die trying.

Yes, Putin is 100% in the wrong, and Zelensky is in the right. But right and wrong have no correlating part in nature. Eat or be eaten does. And in the end, you fight for you, and what you want and need, and if you can't have it no one can.",c13526d0959c9f260da472d6ad69b3ef4d93919c,True,False,,,,,0,1654581311,,0,{},ibgi3u5,False,t3_v6duvi,False,True,t1_ibeyviz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6duvi/its_time_to_show_putin_a_dead_end_in_ukraine_not/ibgi3u5/,1654581327,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654552511.0,

This is just silly already.

An artillery piece with a range of 40km does not need to LITERALLY be in Lysychansk to fire at Russian positions in Sievierodonetsk. An artillery piece with a range of 40km can be in, drum roll, SIVERSK and still fire at those same positions. Siversk to the edge of Sievierodonetsk is 37 km. 

With a grad system okay, you can be closer. But Lysychansk is not even 10km away, barely, from Sivierodonetsk. No genius from the Ukrainian army has legions of artillery sitting in Lysychansk, because that puts them in CLEAR range of Russian artillery systems. They are not like literally sitting on the high ground like something out of Star Wars. Yeah, having some ATGMs or tanks sitting on Lysychansk might be a decent idea, maybe even some mortar systems. Direct fire systems could benefit a lot from having greater elevation.

But there is no grand plan like something out of Sun Tzu's art of war to draw the Russians into artillery range. They are already within artillery range.

That is the only area that I think they are occupying and willing to defend. It's that giant almost rectangular block in the West of the city. My guess:

A few key points about the Industrial Zone and the overall strategy:

\- Easily fortified and defended

\- Stalling action if the Russians advance further

\- It controls the two main roads and bridges out of the city. Those are the two roundabouts on the edge of the Industrial Zone, one of them being the P-66 road.

\- Place to launch raiding actions and to link up with other forces in the area

\- To the East of the Industrial Zone is an area with generally a lot of artificial bodies of water and a small woodland area

\- To the West is a small river

\- From the East they can link up with allies through the woodland and use the various clear bodies of water with no cover, Hvardiivskyi Avenue and and the woodland itself to provide good sites for ambushes and to generally keep the Russians off their flanks.

\- To the West the Borova river is a good place to least keep a relatively solid line of defense, although it would not be very difficult to cross and it may have dried out in places. Generally a more vulnerable defense though

\- Closer to the West is what looks like a place called Stekloplastic, which is apparently a kind of manufacturing plant (apparently involved in fiberglass and other things) and what looks to be a kind of mix of housing and fields, which should give some open terrain to provide some clearer lines of sight should the Russians cross the river

&amp;#x200B;

So generally speaking, if/when they get routed from that Industrial Zone, they have a two main options of retreat but going too deep into the city when the Industrial Zone is more of a defensible position seems like a bad option. This is probably why there are so many conflicting reports. They are using the Industrial Zone as an easily defensible position and launching attacks or defending from there. Pyvovarova St seems to cut the city neatly from the Industrial section, relatively speaking and allows for a decent way to separate out that area and more effectively coordinate a defense. There's also the railroad tracks just on the Eastern edge of the Industrial Zone, which would be a good position, among others, for creating a kill zone.",0b8465dc53a989e86cdbe5b9fc3782cd43891a5d,True,False,,,,,0,1654579475,,0,{},ibgfnh9,False,t3_v6maqb,False,True,t3_v6maqb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6maqb/ukraine_update_70_of_severodonetsk_is_back_under/ibgfnh9/,1654579492,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654550675.0,

If you want to avoid Putin going into a situation where he thinks his best interest is firing off tactical nukes, you avoid actions that put Putin into that situation.  That's why Biden is currently not offering a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Most important, we can't have people like you presuming that Putin will avoid using nukes, and then making a move that Putin expressed he will use nukes if the US acts in that manner.

And the fact that as previously mentioned, Sweden and Finland are already part of EUs defensive alliance. Ukraine had no such defensive alliances.

And some more cynic reasons:

1. Sweden's and Finland's economies are larger than Ukraine's and highly integrated in the EU
2. The Ukrainian conflict is still limited in scope, whereas Russia has little strategic reason to attack Sweden/Finland unless they are planning an all-out war with the West (in which case e.g. seizing Gotland could be advantageous)
3. Actually sending troops carries a huge political cost, when your nation's men and women die on foreign soil.
4. Geopolitically it could play into Russia's hands, since Russia would then actually be fighting against NATO and thus give more substance to their propaganda. Domestically it could potentially provide enough political support to perform a general mobilization and/or transition to war economy.
5. It would escalate the situation *a lot* more than just sending weapons, potentially opening up for attacks on NATO soil

However, Ukraine does not really lack manpower currently. What they need is primarily heavy weapons, funds and training, and in that regard the West both can and is currently helping Ukraine.

I agree that Putin will be back, if he is appeased.  

I'm just saying the West is taking half-measures in order to avoid situations where they can lose everything (full war-&gt;nuke war).  The West will be content subsidizing Ukraine to be slowly ground into powder as long as Russia cripples itself in the process.  That avoids nuclear war and enhances NATO security.  Sometimes you can't get everything you want.

My problem is that Biden's administration isn't preparing for full war.  Biden should be going full MAD doctrine so Putin understands there will be consequences if Putin triggers a casus belli the US/NATO cannot overlook.  If he sees the US running pre-emptive nuke strike drills and changes in nuclear posture, he won't be able to delude himself the West will not risk nuclear war.

It's important to note that this is a very common trope in Russian propaganda. They always try to convince the West that whatever actions we may take are futile. Say that sanctions don't hurt them, but only hurt us. Say that weapon deliveries are a waste of time and money, because they easily crack them or it only prolongs the conflict but they'll still win.

It's important to remember that those are lies, that sanctions are having a massive effect on Russia (that's why they keep begging for sanctions relief), that weapons and support for Ukraine are helping them survive as a sovereign democratic state, and that Russia is being weakened every day they keep this war going.

It's also important to let everyone know that this is a pattern in Russian propaganda so everyone knows to ignore that crap coming from them.",8c70fc151ac0b54c327b9c06e93ccb2598b27cf5,True,False,,,,,0,1654574344,,0,{},ibg7vzo,False,t3_v6e9vw,False,True,t1_ibfm2o7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6e9vw/russian_state_news_agency_tass_has_a_lot_of/ibg7vzo/,1654574354,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654545544.0,

The gamble hasn't been a rewarding situation for Putin, but he still thinks he will cripple Ukraine by seizing all of southern Ukraine, and Ukraine won't get enough firepower from the US soon enough to stop Putin.  Russia has 4 times the military (and population) to Ukraine, so their game plan now is spending the next three years slowing grinding away Ukrainian fighters, in exchange for Russian cannon fodder.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted food supplies for many nations in the world, causing prices to soar.

There would probably be a bunch of the T-62M with just the appliqué armour and no ERA but the most common variant in service is the T-62MV with an earlier variant of Kontakt ERA fitted. It’s used in the southern military theatre due to it being both a lower risk theatre and due to terrain/infrastructure that suits lighter tanks.


Unlike China with the excellent Type 15, Russia doesn’t have the budget to introduce specialty Light MBT’s into service (not to be confused with light tanks) so it makes sense to up armour and up engine an older reliable tank like the T-62 to fill the role at a budget. 


Make fun of them all you like but it’s the type that made up the bulk of their armoured units during their invasion of Georgia and they performed very well against Georgian T-72s that had been extensively modernised by western companies. 


Are there a handful of less advanced variants that were pulled out of reserve stocks in other military regions to make up combat losses? Yes of course and there’s plenty of images of them.

2.	Russian forces in the Izyum area did not make any confirmed advances, while forces advancing west from Lyman secured minor gains.
3.	Russian forces continued unsuccessful attempts to sever Ukrainian lines of communication northeast of Bakhmut.
4.	Limited and localized Ukrainian counterattacks on June 5 forced Russian troops to focus on holding defensive lines north of Kharkiv City on June 6.
5.	Russian occupation authorities are advancing efforts to issue Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens and cement their control over occupied territories.
6.	The Ukrainian Navy claimed to have pushed the Russian Black Sea Fleet more than 100 km from the Ukrainian coast, likely to reduce the pressure of the Russian blockade on Ukraine’s southern ports.",f44961a99c8d84d0e0626f55e1bd3a1d3b91390d,True,False,,,,,0,1654566727,,0,{},ibftosc,False,t3_v6hgqe,False,True,t3_v6hgqe,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v6hgqe/russian_offensive_campaign_assessment_june_6/ibftosc/,1654566745,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654537927.0,

As long as Ukraine is willing to keep fighting, this war is a fairly straightforward (brutal and difficult, but straightforward) win for them — the easiest way to project the math is that the relative casualty rates are higher than the relative population.   If Putin (as an absurd thought-experiment) was somehow able to keep funneling Russian people into the war in perpetuity, eventually Russia would run out of population before Ukraine did.  As Russia gradually loses military capabilities, these casualty rates are going to get worse rather than better.  What's going to happen over the next few-to-several months is that Ukraine is going to push Russia to the borders, with the likely exception of Crimea.

What happens after that is unclear, and could get very interesting.

\--

The frightening thing is Putin can ""keep funneling people into the war"" for far longer than one might expect — much like the Iran/Iraq war.  Politically, he's already incurred the consequences (both external and internal) for his actions, so doubling and tripling down changes nothing until he so deeply overreaches that one of his own men kills him.  It's dangerously similar to Tsar Nicholas II.

It's like being a death row inmate.  If you're already on death row, why **not** kill someone in prison?  What are they going to threaten you with when you're already condemned to death in the very near future?",71d6fcaac6976a2b86ed6ae6979e0e5930162592,True,False,,,,,0,1654566134,,0,{},ibfsiw4,False,t3_v5fvu3,False,True,t1_ibedxs7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5fvu3/why_ukraine_war_is_not_the_wests_fault_realism/ibfsiw4/,1654566162,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654537334.0,

The 155mm is not just standard throughout all NATO countries, it's also in wide use by NATO and Ukraine friendly nations like Australia, South Korea, Japan, and many others.  Many arsenals worldwide are capable of manufacturing them and all of them within NATO are probably working as hard as possible to do just that.

That said, there were certain misconceptions about Germany that the Allies held to in 1939.  The most important was that they massively overrated the strength of the Siegfried line, and thus the ability of Germany to resist a strong push into southern Germany.  Hitler's propaganda about how it was complete and strong was effective.  The second is that they overrated the ability of the Luftwaffe to strike London and Paris with devastating effect.  The Allied bombing campaign started off fairly mild, in an effort to control the kind of weapons used by unspoken agreement (similar to how all sides restrained themselves in regards to chemical weapons).  

They had also suffered a serious setback in their warplanning because of the combination of weak Allied diplomacy in the Thirties and the King of Belgium being somewhat pro-Nazi (or at least advised by pro-Nazis), which scrambled Gamelin's primary warplan.  And of course the British Army always takes months to actually get ready for a full-on war.

And tbh, given how much impunity Russia (and China, even Turkey, and Saudis) have seemed to have in the last decade going after 'their' people abroad including in places like the US, UK, Germany, with anywhere from poisoning, bombing, getting shot, abducted etc, its not too surprising.

That said, there is still a good chunk of Russian diaspora still stuck to their from-back-home tv channels and online papers, which for authoritarian regimes is very tightly controlled and pro-regime, and therefore continue to extend their brainwashing to their diaspora even abroad .. the recent moves in some baltics to ban Russian broadcast as propaganda makes sense in this light, but we probably do need to come to a more nuanced compromise on how we deal with free-speech vs genocidal-propaganda in the 'free-world' west.",ac29e831487b37f79d309c4f3470ae0cf8ec98be,True,False,,,,,0,1654561282,,0,{},ibfix5j,False,t3_v61075,False,True,t1_ibd3ztn,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v61075/survey_33_of_finlands_80000_russianspeakers/ibfix5j/,1654561293,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654532482.0,
