Key Takeaways

Russian forces have likely established control over the majority of the residential sector of Severodonetsk and conducted assaults against Ukrainian positions in the industrial zone in the past 24 hours. The operational environment within the city remains fluid.

Russian forces continued efforts to advance on Slovyansk southeast from the Izyum area and west from Lyman, attempting to break through Ukrainian defenses that have halted most direct frontal assaults from Izyum.
Russian forces are likely attempting to reinforce their operations in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area from both the Toshkivka-Ustynivka area in the south and Kupyansk from the northwest.

Russian forces began withdrawing troops from positions in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely either to rotate damaged units into rear areas or to reinforce Russian defenses in northwestern Kherson Oblast, though ISW cannot currently confirm the destination of these forces.

Russian forces failed to regain advanced positions on the western (now Ukrainian-occupied) bank of the Ihulets River on June 7.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russian forces restored transit connections between newly occupied cities and Crimea.

Russian occupation authorities continue to face challenges suppressing Ukrainian resistance and finding partisan supporters despite increasingly draconian occupation measures and attempts to bribe Ukrainian civilians.",41df770232de62eb82dd67e7f275ad7f494fb476,True,False,,,,,0,1654646027,,0,{},ibjroa4,False,t3_v6tksr,False,True,t3_v6tksr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6tksr/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_07_2022/ibjroa4/,1654646043,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654617227.0

So we are too take away from this that Russia is... not scary? Or is incompetent but also dangerous? Like I said, you're bordering up against subjective and meaningless value statements that are not *helpful* as a basis for analysis. Statements such as:

&gt;It has no culture of promoting competence, on the contrary

are typically not based on much more than subjective cultural assessments of societies writ large. Plenty of states have high degrees of corruption and a relatively incompetent civil service and yet this is not reflected on the battlefield (do you really want to argue that Azerbaijan, for example, has a higher culture of ""promoting competence"" than Armenia? Please). 

Another particularly relevant example is The Nazi state, for example, had a culture of thuggish loyalism and factionalism that created numerous amounts of duplication of work, promotion of incompetence (see: Herman Goering) and yet it took an alliance of the world's great powers to bring that particular nation down (for more on this check out Richard Overy's *Why the Allies Won*). My point is simply that broad-based national characterizations are rarely, if ever, appropriate when analyzing military performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It fought like this in Chechnya, it fights like this in Ukraine. It can try something flashy from time to time, but the moment the going gets hard - it immediately reverts to the scorched earth strategy.

This is a far cry from your statement of ""this is the only way russia knows how to war."" Sure we may perhaps qualify this statement by saying that given the current impositions and constraints on the Russian military (brought about by political difficulties - again, not a uniquely Russian failure)  prevent the Russian military from being *more* sophisticated in its post-soviet form, but this is a far cry from ""this is all that Russia knows how to do."" 

&gt;And no, I am not gonna discuss Golden Horde times. You can take it as a win, if you wish.

If you want to cast your historical fishing line back to the human wave assaults of 1941 and 1916, then you're free to do so, but you don't get to pick and choose your historical cases to suit your argument. My point isn't that we need to go back to the 14th century to find examples of Russian success, simply that Russia has shown various high points and low points throughout its history in various different conflicts, each of which must be evaluated based on the actual conditions and contexts of those conflicts - not broad-based cultural chauvinism. 

I'll finish this off by noting that this [particular podcast](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/analysis-of-the-war-in-ukraine-june-5-2022) (featuring actual experts) discusses current tactics being employed by the Russian Army in Ukraine, how they're a consequence of force structure decisions made in the 2000s, and how they've achieved varying degrees of success and failure for a number of reasons.

For all the talk of the 'crazy' Norks, the efforts by North Korea to gain nuclear weapons to offset the conventional force disparities is indisputably rational, and follows the same reasoning that the US followed in the early Cold War to offset Soviet military superiority. 

---------------

&gt; * …many of the missiles that North Korea has launched since the second US-North Korea summit meeting in February 2019, considering their flight distance, have been intended for counterforce attacks to accurately hit relatively small targets such as the headquarters of United States Forces Korea (USFK).

&gt; * North Korea has developed the solid-fueled KN-02 (""Toksa"") as a short-range missile to succeed the Scud series and extended its range to put the USFK headquarters relocated to Pyeongtaek within striking distance, and already completed its operational deployment. 

&gt; * However, the KN-02's extended range and increased accuracy will make the missile's trajectory clearer and relatively easier to intercept from the perspective of the USFK. The higher the hit rate, the easier it is for ballistic missiles to be intercepted; how is North Korea trying to escape this paradox?

&gt; * One way to do so is to change the missile's trajectory from a simple ballistic trajectory to an irregular one.

&gt; * Although the KN-23 is a ballistic missile, it takes an irregular trajectory by performing a ""pull-up"" maneuver when descending after reaching apogee. As a result, North Korea is trying to avoid interception by disrupting ballistic calculations while improving the accuracy of missile hits.

&gt; * In fact, Kim Jong-un in his report also referred to ""tactical nuclear weapons"" in the section describing ""the core plans and strategic tasks of crucial importance in rapidly developing and strengthening the national defense industry”…

&gt; * If this missile has a range of about 800 km, it can cover the US's Sasebo Naval Base and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, which were used as combat bases for UN forces during the Korean War. 

&gt; * This suggests that North Korea, which has less conventional military strength than the ROK/US Combined Forces Command (CFC), is preparing a system to deter US military intervention at each stage of ""escalation"" while suggesting the option of a preemptive nuclear strike.

&gt; * Such a nuclear posture resembles that of Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear posture, also known as ""asymmetric escalation"" (V. Narang), is a strategy in which Pakistan, which is in an asymmetrical (inferior) situation vis-à-vis India in terms of conventional military strength, attempts to deter India's conventional forces by showing its willingness to use preemptive nuclear strikes and its readiness to escalate a conflict.

&gt; * North Korea has so far suggested that early use of nuclear weapons would prevent escalation. But if North Korea possesses tactical nuclear weapons, its nuclear posture will eventually become ""Pakistanized.""

For all the talk of the 'crazy' Norks, the efforts by North Korea to gain nuclear weapons to offset the conventional force disparities is indisputably rational, and follows the same reasoning that the US followed in the early Cold War to offset Soviet military superiority. 

---------------

&gt; * …many of the missiles that North Korea has launched since the second US-North Korea summit meeting in February 2019, considering their flight distance, have been intended for counterforce attacks to accurately hit relatively small targets such as the headquarters of United States Forces Korea (USFK).

&gt; * North Korea has developed the solid-fueled KN-02 (""Toksa"") as a short-range missile to succeed the Scud series and extended its range to put the USFK headquarters relocated to Pyeongtaek within striking distance, and already completed its operational deployment. 

&gt; * However, the KN-02's extended range and increased accuracy will make the missile's trajectory clearer and relatively easier to intercept from the perspective of the USFK. The higher the hit rate, the easier it is for ballistic missiles to be intercepted; how is North Korea trying to escape this paradox?

&gt; * One way to do so is to change the missile's trajectory from a simple ballistic trajectory to an irregular one.

&gt; * Although the KN-23 is a ballistic missile, it takes an irregular trajectory by performing a ""pull-up"" maneuver when descending after reaching apogee. As a result, North Korea is trying to avoid interception by disrupting ballistic calculations while improving the accuracy of missile hits.

&gt; * In fact, Kim Jong-un in his report also referred to ""tactical nuclear weapons"" in the section describing ""the core plans and strategic tasks of crucial importance in rapidly developing and strengthening the national defense industry”…

&gt; * If this missile has a range of about 800 km, it can cover the US's Sasebo Naval Base and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, which were used as combat bases for UN forces during the Korean War. 

&gt; * This suggests that North Korea, which has less conventional military strength than the ROK/US Combined Forces Command (CFC), is preparing a system to deter US military intervention at each stage of ""escalation"" while suggesting the option of a preemptive nuclear strike.

&gt; * Such a nuclear posture resembles that of Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear posture, also known as ""asymmetric escalation"" (V. Narang), is a strategy in which Pakistan, which is in an asymmetrical (inferior) situation vis-à-vis India in terms of conventional military strength, attempts to deter India's conventional forces by showing its willingness to use preemptive nuclear strikes and its readiness to escalate a conflict.

&gt; * North Korea has so far suggested that early use of nuclear weapons would prevent escalation. But if North Korea possesses tactical nuclear weapons, its nuclear posture will eventually become ""Pakistanized.""

In the same way that russia is burning its deep reserves of Soviet *garbage* for incremental gains in ukraine with reckless abandon, so too has the US been able to burn off a huge stockpile of javelin missiles. We're not talking about F16s for ukraine (yet), we're still arguing about MIGs for ukraine. Even the HIMARS systems appear to be the old ones, rather than the new ones, though my knowledge here is spotty at best.

&gt;What's hilarious is you haven't even lived in the US long enough for that claim to even be true. So you're lying.

I might only have been here a few years, but I am a US taxpayer. I'd also make the same argument about UK NVG equipment, too, where I paid taxes for 4 decades.

&gt;So, NVG are American mission essential equipment that were required before Feb 2022 but not anymore because you decide Ukraine needs it.

Stop making up bullshit arguments I never said.

I stated that because of the current strategic geopolitical situation, it is incredibly unlikely that 100% of US ground troops will need to be deployed within the next few years. As such, the equipment for some small proportion of those troops is currently surplus to requirements and as such those assets would have better ROI and utilization if loaned to Ukraine.

That's what I said.

Here's what you said:

* I made a mistake bigger than the Russian generals.
* You'd rather nuke Ukraine than let them have a small number of NVGs
* You claimed I said the US faced no threats (I didn't)
* You equated loaning a small amount of NVG equipment to Ukraine so it can be used for what it's intended for (without US casualties!) to confiscating the entire life savings of a US resident, and you did it with a straight face.

[],False,,sanderudam,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iure,False,False,"&gt;I agree Ukraine is likely hurting more, possibly significantly more, in this second Phase than Russia is

I doubt it. For a number of reasons, but because of visible Ukrainian strategy in particular. It is clear to both sides that we are currently in a war of attrition. If Ukraine reckons that they are taking heavier losses than Russia is they would abandon the Sievierodonetsk salient, shrink the frontage, pull closer to friendly AA assets and artillery, while reducing strain on their logistics. This would allow Ukraine to considerably improve their rate of attrition relative to Russia.

The fact that Ukraine (so far) is committing to Sievierodonetsk indicates that they believe they are causing and can cause Russians heavier attrition than they are taking in return.

Some potential counter-arguments could be that:

a) Ukraine is taking heavier losses than Russia, but thinks it has deeper ability to reconstitute their losses

b) Ukraine mistakenly believes Russian losses are greater (or might not know their own losses)

c) Ukrainian military would like to retreat for the aforementioned reasons but can not (more likely politically than physically)

d) Ukraine knows they are taking heavier losses but expects the situation to change for some reason in near future

e) Ukrainian high command is stupid

f) Something else

I personally think that Ukraine is recognizing that Russia has overwhelmingly exhausted their offensive capabilities for the moment and the rate of losses (for both sides) has come down by a factor of 2-3 from just a few weeks ago.

I also think that a lot of people here (in this thread, in the west etc) are underestimating the losses of DNR/LNR. It is possible that Russian armed forces are taking less losses than Ukraine is - over the past weeks. But the losses of Russia and DNR/LNR combined are heavier.",2630d25ad13ae1fa3271793e6a29cd9375cdda67,True,False,,,,,0,1654630719,,0,{},ibivqi5,False,t3_v6tksr,False,True,t1_ibinzw2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6tksr/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_07_2022/ibivqi5/,1654630733,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654601919.0

I agree that Western support is heavy on quality over quantity, but this is likely on purpose. The West could flood Ukraine with outdated equipment, but then Ukraine will have to deal with an even more complicated logistics system than they're already dealing with (which is a nightmare). So a few higher quality systems put less strain on their logistics while still having a tangible impact. I agree that the West could and should be doing more though. We have *tons* of Paladins and similar SPGs lying around, they should be sent to Ukraine to increase their artillery quantity, along with tons of 155mm shells. 

&gt;Not enough small arms are being sent. TDF brigades are going into battle with insufficient ammunition and with older AKs. 

This goes to my same point about logistics. Ukraine has ridiculous numbers of AKs lying around plus the ammo for them. There's no real value to adding M16s/M4s which use a different caliber ammunition. TDF do need more body armor, helmets, and other gear though.

First, the weapon deliveries for Ukraine have been incorrectly focused on quality instead of quantity. In this war it's better to send 50 old MLRS systems than 10 new ones, 500 old howitzers than 100 new ones, etc. The new weapons are too few to make substantial difference despite their edge in quality. In general, newer systems are significantly more expensive and spend the limited budget faster. 

Not enough small arms are being sent. TDF brigades are going into battle with insufficient ammunition and with older AKs. Sending a 100K unneeded M16s with sufficient ammo, sending a large number of grenades, would make the TDF brigades more combat effective especially since they are used on the frontline.

Second, the thing that we need to know in order to predict who will win this war or at least who will succeed in the next several very pivotal months, is the state of the Ukrainian reserves. We know that Russia is running on fumes as far as reserves based on the info we are getting from the war. The question is whether Ukraine is currently using all its reserves (talking about trained and equipped troops, supplied with heavy weapons) on the frontline as well or something rather substantial is held back for a large counteroffensive. If Ukraine is committing everything to the battle of Donbas, it is in trouble. If it is readying several brigades for a large counteroffensive soon (next couple of months) then Russia is trouble. Not having that information is the reason why this war is so hard to predict.",22dd92e5df2dd7d78ea08270450c1c065a9c67f2,True,False,,,,,0,1654627093,,0,{},ibind0r,False,t3_v6tksr,False,True,t3_v6tksr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6tksr/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_07_2022/ibind0r/,1654627112,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654598293.0

Wartime production in the GWOT was nothing like WW2, which most people wrongly assume is the norm of what's capable when a country mobilizes for war. It was actually a fluke because the reality is the US Army in particular planned out that mass mobilization of the economy since the mid 1920s, the plans were set in stone in the mid 30s, they started in '37 when the first major funding increases were passed and it took eight years to get to max capacity. 

Nobody wants to wait eight years now and nobody planned for this, there are no plans for mobilization of industry coinciding with a major war because the only countries that can destroy our military necessitating that have hundreds or thousands of nukes pointed our way and us them. It's as bad as mass conscription, it's so politically infeasible nobody really contemplates it. And without a solid plan it's not happening quickly or smoothly.

Night vision and drones are actually pretty complicated tech. Expanding factories for them is not the same as throwing up some sheet metal walls and roof and bringing in some welding and riveting equipment that Rosie and her plucky pals can get a couple days of lessons and start cranking out tanks and airplanes that are rather simple to build, without worrying about OSHA or the EPA, while having the industrial backbone in raw materials (especially steel) to make it all. NVGs aren't too hard to assemble once the components are made but those are the problem. For example, remember the microchip shortage? Kind of a big deal. And drones are even harder to make.

Plus, dramatically ramping up production means funding. And guess what the Lend Lease Bill didn't really expand on? If the US wants major defense industry expansion it's going to need to pay up with amounts that will absolutely dwarf what goes to Ukraine because we'd be guaranteeing contracts for an extended period, including funding to expand, or else they won't agree because they'll lose money and eat billions. 

If the POTUS enacts the DPA, NVGs and drones aren't surgical masks or baby formula, so good luck with that. 

This is why I hate the 2022 Lend Lease Bill having that name. People assume it's the same but it's nothing like it.

Yes?

I'm sorry, but did you equate me suggesting that *perhaps some mothballed old equipment and 5-10% of the current US NVG arsenal is actually surplus to requirements in the short term*

Did you just equate that to Russia trying to drive columns of unknowing and essentially untrained conscripts in single file down open highways into the jaws of thousands of well equipped, dug-in Ukrainian troops?

I ask because it does seem to be an over the top response to such a basic and, IMO **really obviously true** statement that perhaps, given the current state of world affairs it's possible that the US might have SLIGHTLY MORE night vision goggle sets than it actually needs.

Yes, it does seem over the top.

Does it not?

&gt;I'd sooner personally nuke Ukraine than allow what you're proposing to happen.

Is that an attempt to be all *""Well, if you didn't think that was over the top, then this really will be!""* ???

You just made the same type of bad prediction as the Russians telling their troops ""don't worry guys, the Ukrainians won't fight back."" Worse actually, since you completely downplayed all threats from the entire world and not just one country in order to get what you want.  

Here's why I'm worried. When you're wrong, what are the repercussions?

When Russia was wrong it meant the better part of a hundred thousand casualties, a disastrous quagmire, their economy hurt if not worse, and turning into an international pariah. Everyone can admit they are in bad shape. Is that an acceptable end state for the US? Our arsenal is designed to protect against that.

When the Ukrainians made bad decisions not to take the Russian threat serious enough, like not to invest more of their GDP to defense,  or worse, not mobilizing until after they were invaded, the US led the effort to save them from their mistakes. Who bails out the US after we strip our forces of mission essential equipment because #SlavaUkraini trumps our own readiness? 

How about Ukraine itself? What happens to them when their chief benefactor gets buttfucked in an unexpected conflict potentially caused because a foreign enemy realized the US was deliberately weakening itself for #SlavaUkraini? 

You and others might be willing to make that bet, but many Americans aren't, because at the end of the day their loyalty is to the US, not the UA, whatever is trending on social media. And if they try force a policy to deliberately weaken the US to Ukraine the backlash is going to huge and will likely create a very large and loud movement to cut all funding to Ukraine, because clearly the Ukraine war mongerers have lost their minds and must be stopped before they can destroy the US too. 

Does that seem over-the-top? If your policy is as you profess, it's actually exactly how it'll be perceived. America can go fuck itself, the thing that matters is #SlavaUkraini. Ukraine will not win the war of it pushes that narrative, it will be forced to except a humiliating peace because a major opposition will be created that will force the US to limit or outright cut funding, because at that point it'll be an ""us or them"" scenario.

\-------------------------------------

This analysis is absurdly weak.  The most glaring problem is they arbitrarily picked Gaussian distributions for all parameters, with standard deviations of 5%.  That's... ridiculous.  It's like claiming that every running back's rushing yards in their next game will be no more than 10% different from what it was in their last game.

I strongly suspect they ended up using such small standard deviations because when they tried Gaussians with more realistic widths, they ended up with a few simulations where a fleet finished the battle with *more carriers than they started with.*  ""oopsies, Pkill on that sim was randomly set to a negative number""  That should have told them their model is fundamentally flawed and useless.  But then they wouldn't have a paper.  So instead they cranked the variation down so low that the impossible results don't happen anymore, and they breeze past the model design with a single sentence ""As we have no information about variability of each probability, we assume a standard deviation of 0.05"".   If they'd run 1 million sims instead of 100k, they'd maybe have still gotten a few impossible results and then this statement would be changed to ""we assume a standard deviation of 0.01""

Many Redditors seem to think there are elves in camouflage working in the South Pole cranking out weaponry, ammo, and everything else to give to the Ukrainians, not realizing that US defense manufacturing is actually small and not set up for expansion or large scale increase. The stuff we're giving them were ordered years ago for us to get issued not to sit in storage, so everything we give is something we lose. 

Look at MLRS. Reddit is furious that the US is dragging their feet on those. Forgetting the strategic implications of weaponry that can be used to attack Russia itself, there are other issues. Hardly anyone realizes that the Ukrainians got those M777 cannons last month only because the USMC voluntarily gave them up. Because the USMC wanted more MLRS too. The Army was expanding MLRS production. It was expected to take years, because the defense industry didn't suddenly expand ten fold to fill one order, because that's not how things work. So who got screwed and aren't getting more MLRS? The Army? Marines?

While I would normally agree, I think there's an argument that while Russia is heavily committed to a war in which a very significant portion of their available offensive troops are engaged (or even lost in) that 100% of the US arsenal is not ""essential"" right now.

China has no ability to project force anywhere that would require a 100% committed response from the US on any kind of timescale that would matter, and Russia can't with it's current commitments.

There is certainly a reasonable argument to be made, or debated, that the Russian war in the Ukraine renders - in the short term - a significant fraction of the US military ""non-essential"" until Russia withdraws or re-equips and re-recruits/trains. And the US can acquire NVGs faster than Russia can do that.

So yes, I think there's an argument to send some small percentage of what until Feb 2022 was regarded as ""essential"" equipment which is no longer essential.

I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that between stores of older materiel and some draw down of more current models the US military could find somewhere in the many tens of thousands of headsets range to provide to Ukraine.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;That doesn't change that they were there and that playing nice was the only thing preventing the Taliban from massacring them

This is again you totally misrepresenting the situation. 

First, again, the contractors were only in danger to begin with because the US military, under orders they protested, evacuated Afghanistan without telling US nationals in the country. 

Second, we didn't authorize an immediate NEO to evacuate them and the Afghans we promised to evacuate until Kabul was being threatened, so they didn't have any security until Biden authorized the Army and Marines to send a limited number of troops to hold the airport after the evacuation clusterfuck started. So we evacuated and then had to resend troops because, whoopsie, it turns out pulling a Gallipoli exit without telling our allies created a nationwide collapse. 

Third, US contractors were nearly all in the big FOBs around Kabul area in the first place and after the evacuation started they all went to the airport to get a flight out. The only way they could have been massacred is if POTUS deliberately allowed them to be.

&gt;If we dropped bombs what do you think would happen?

The US would have absolutely slaughtered the Taliban in numbers that would have been astounding.

Remember the ease in 2001-2 to topple the Taliban? That was because they tried to resist as if they were a conventional military against the Northern Alliance, like the decade before, but US airstrikes directed by SOCOM embedded with the NA were able to pinpoint Taliban locations and drop PGMs on them. 

The US specializes in destroying third world conventional militaries but it sucks at COIN largely because we can't find the bad guys to capture or kill them. But when insurgent groups launch Phase 3 uprisings in the form of nation wide offensives they aren't hiding in the shadows anymore fighting as guerrillas doing hit and run. They're taking and holding ground, they're massing in the hundreds of thousands in the open, using radios and phones that give away their locations, relying on supply lines, using motor pools, using field HQs, etc. All that stuff makes them super easy to find and with our modern weaponry super easy to target. It would have been a turkey shoot. And it wouldn't even have been hard to do, send SOCOM back over to call in airstrikes and then send in the air assets. Basically just repeat 2001-2 but with much better ISR and weaponry. Same what we did to help defeat ISIS when they tried playing conventional military too.

If the Taliban tried to bumrush Kabul to attack the airport a few AC-130 would kill everyone in the city with a visible weapon. 

But if the US had planned something beyond ""Operation Run Away with our Tail Between our Legs"" we'd not even have to worry about the Taliban being near Kabul, they'd be running for the Pakistan border to try to survive when our expats were being evacuated. 

And then after that, we wipe our hands, tell our Afghan allies ""you're welcome"" and leave them to their fates, having at least bought them  2-3 years while getting some much needed vengeance on the Taliban to close the war. We leave on OUR terms, not theirs.",2d3802c1b3c9b44e308699bbd5235467929ab33f,True,False,,,,,0,1654620357,,0,{},ibi7g44,False,t3_v6elc5,False,True,t1_ibhzusf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6elc5/element_of_surprise_the_west_needs_to_be_more/ibi7g44/,1654620376,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654591557.0

The Japanese sent a convoy to Singora on 8 December 1941 that landed the 1st Tank Battalion, with 37 Type 97 medium tanks and 20 Type 95 light tanks, landed from landing craft while the vessels anchored offshore^(1). This included the Army Landing Craft Depot Ship *Shinshū Maru*, which had a floodable well deck for her dozens of landing craft. The *Daihatsu* landing craft carried by this and other ships was also the landing craft that inspired Higgins to use a bow ramp for his own creations, which were much more capable than the Japanese versions. 

By 1941 amphibious assault standards, the Japanese were arguably the most capable force on the planet, as their dozens of successful assaults on 8-12 December 1941 show, to say nothing of those in the next four months. 

However, 1941 amphibious assault standards were garbage, and the United States and Royal Navies quickly leapfrogged over the Japanese and within a year were an order of magnitude more capable. The Japanese assaults largely succeeded because they attacked areas that were lightly defended or not defended at all, and success at Midway would have been far more difficult. While on the subject, *Shinshū Maru* had been sunk by Japanese torpedoes in March and had not yet been salvaged, and the only other landing craft depot ship in commission was in Saigon during the Battle of Midway. 

I'll address a couple of your other points below briefly:

&gt;Kurita's four cruisers (the only ships in the Midway attack force that were actually allocated for shore bombardment) would have made a lot of noise and thrown up a lot of sand but probably done very little to reduce the effectiveness of Midway's defenses.

Other ships would likely be ordered to provide support once the invasion began and the Japanese ground forces began encountering stiff resistance. They would not be particularly effective.

&gt;Re: air support, Kido Butai was a raiding force. They did not have the logistical ability to park themselves off of an island and launch bombing raids for days or weeks on end. If they'd tried that they would have quickly run out of fuel and bombs. 

The Japanese carriers were a raiding force, but they had also successfully supported several amphibious assaults. Most on point, *Sōryū* and *Hiryū* had supported the second Wake invasion (the first was the only one that I offhand recalled failed this early in the war). These were often only a few days of strikes, nothing like the sustained attacks of the US later in the war, though I should mention that even late in the war the US carrier magazines were only rated for about ten sorties per aircraft (I can't recall the Japanese standards offhand, but it was similar and probably a bit lower). The main reason the US could sustain such strikes were the number of carriers we brought to bear, one of the aspects that made our amphibious assault capabilities far better in 1944 than the Japanese in 1941.

&gt;Lol, I'm scared of more Ukrainian lives dying, inflation and gas prices. I want Ukraine to win faster. Sue me.

Then why bring up your guestimate for victory? Forget that, if you're worried about those things then you should want a diplomatic conclusion ASAP, not a long gruelling war to recapture 20% of the largest country in Europe.

&gt;USA needs this win almost as much as Ukraine. 

No we don't. 

We wanted a weakened Russia who isn't a credible threat to NATO, that's already occurred. Fully defeating Russia in Ukraine doesn't negate Russia as a future threat, Putin isn't getting overthrown, and now Cold War 2.0 is now in full effect. That's even why Biden admin recently walked back earlier inflammatory comments with his recent NYT editorial. 

Meanwhile, the US is facing inflation, crippling gas prices, global food crisis, and a likely recession starting. This war didn't do all of that but it's making things worse. MLRS or not, Ukraine isn't retaking it's lost territory this year and probably not even the next. If that is the end state this war has barely begun, and the negative effects just started. 

And that doesn't even consider the ramifications of arming Ukraine unrelated to production, logistics, and training. The US had never escalated a proxy war to this degree. We are pushing ourselves into a dangerous situation every time we give UA better kit. That's going to come with a cost of some sort. If nothing else the US guaranteed that the next time it gets into a foreign conflict that Russia will replicate this proxy war against us. They'd be fools not to.

We managed to do the whole GWOT without worrying about ATGMs or modern MANPADS and overt training, support, funding by Russia, with the closest it ever came to nastiness was the unconfirmed rumor of Russians giving bounties to the Taliban for US dead, that happened in the closing years of the Afghan War when almost no Americans were dying in comparison to years earlier. Meanwhile, SECDEF openly declared that US policy is to destroy the Russian military to prevent it being a threat in the future, Biden tried to use the media to orchestrate a coup against Biden, etc, while we created the greatest proxy war in history against Russia, who might lose in Ukraine but will not be decisively defeated to the point we don't need to worry about them afterwards.

The expert on the country’s armed forces says the context in which a war occurs does much to affect its outcome

https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/06/07/nato-should-avoid-learning-the-wrong-lessons-from-russias-blunder-in-ukraine-says-michael-kofman

Russia’s lacklustre military performance in Ukraine has badly damaged the reputation of its armed forces. Bogged down, and with losses mounting, the Russian army hardly appears to be the second- or third-most capable force in the world, as was previously thought. Conversely, nato has been reinvigorated, with Finland and Sweden hoping to join. Vladimir Putin’s invasion has proved to be a colossal miscalculation. Yet some in NATO may be overinterpreting the lessons of this war, and failing to take a longer view of European security. Russia is not going away as a strategic competitor, nor does it have Potemkin armed forces. Its progress in eastern Ukraine in recent days, albeit fitful and incremental, shows as much.

Defence communities tend not to deal in nuance–policy often resembles a swinging pendulum. If Russia’s military power had previously been exaggerated in Western defence circles, it is now probably underrated. The reality lies between the two. As the aphorism goes, Russia is never as strong, nor as weak, as she looks. More importantly, military power is often closely tied to the context, and much of Russia’s performance in this war can be tied to the peculiarity of its terribly conceived plan and the political assumptions of its leadership.

During the initial invasion, Russia’s armed forces pursued an unworkable military strategy, chasing unachievable objectives. The troops were neither informed about, nor prepared for, a major war. Since then, they have adjusted substantially. In the Donbas, Russian forces are prosecuting the offensive in a manner much closer to how they train and organise to fight. Despite a substantially diminished force, the Russian offensive has made incremental gains. The war could become even more protracted. Russia failed in its bid to deny Ukraine sovereignty, but it is unclear whether Ukraine will be able to take back lost territory, even with extensive Western support.

As it stands, the Russian army is in no position to start another conflict, let alone one with nato. This should bring cold comfort to nato members, however. It may be tempting to believe that because Ukraine has done remarkably well against Russian forces, a nato victory could be taken for granted in almost any scenario. That is the wrong lesson to take away from this war. The peculiarities of the situation in which a war occurs strongly determine how military power manifests and whether it can achieve political aims. An American defeat in Afghanistan offers few insights on how a war with China might go. A good analogy for the current war might be the unexpectedly poor Soviet performance in the “winter war” with Finland of 1939-40. It revealed weaknesses and structural problems in the Red Army, but the German leadership may have misinterpreted the lessons of that conflict in planning Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.

It is clear that the Russian armed forces are not just suffering from a bad plan in Ukraine. From the perspective of training, leadership and discipline, their army has serious deficiencies. However, there is much about the war that we still do not know, and our early interpretations of it could be wrong. In time we may discover that the opening phase was more of a close-run affair. More thorough analysis will reveal that Russian performance varied depending on which axis of advance and which part of the army one chooses to examine. For example, the Russian forces in the south broke out from Crimea and rapidly captured large swathes of territory. They still hold it. Furthermore, there is much that is unknown about what support America provided, beyond just weapons, and how much of an effect that has had. Ultimately, a reassessment will be in order, not just of where the Russian armed forces are, but where they are going.

Another area where Russia fell flat was its inability to scale up operations. What its army could do on a lesser scale in 2014 and 2015, it could not replicate across Ukraine. From communications to logistics, combined arms and beyond, Russia’s armed forces lacked experience in large-scale operations prior to the invasion, and it showed. But so would nato, were it not for America. From the intervention in Libya in 2011, to the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, it is not clear what nato can do without the United States. Russia’s armed forces now have experience scaling operations, having learned the hard way from costly mistakes (as the Soviet Army did before them). The Russian armed forces will take years to recover from this blunder but, at the same time, failure is often a better teacher than success.

Western sentiments whiplashed from last year’s dismay over European states’ inability to hold a single airport in Afghanistan without American support, to enthusiasm after Ukraine’s unexpected success. Yet this shift in perceptions should not mislead nato members into the belief that, in a different context, Russia would be easily defeated. Although Russian military power was overestimated, nato should assess where things stand soberly. America will continue to shift its focus to competition with China, investing in the military balance in the Indo-Pacific. The alliance’s looming expansion will add military capability, but also bring new challenges. A global economic recession, and the long-term cost of rebuilding Ukraine, may suck away resources once marked for defence spending.

The conflict serves as a fresh reminder that sustained conventional war hinges on the availability of manpower, materiel, ammunition and defence industrial capacity to sustain it. There’s much nato can do to improve capacity across these categories. Were the alliance similarly tested, nato armed forces could find that they, too, have many of the problems Russia has had in Ukraine. It follows that the alliance should not take a dismissive attitude towards Russia, or become complacent. Despite significant losses, the Russian army will rebuild sooner or later. Sanctions will affect Russia’s defence industry, but writing Russia off as a military power would be the wrong lesson to learn from this war.

And how do you know that? Because some Ukrainians said so on social media? 

Fun fact, nearly every people or nation who have ever capitulated in warfare had many of their people making bombastic claims all the way to the point they signed the surrender documents. Actions speak louder than words. 

And morale is fickle. Nobody could legitimately estimate it before this war, if they did they'd be bullshitting. We can only suspect what it is at the present. And only guess what it'll be in the future, but nobody really knows.

Look at the effort the Ukrainian govt has taken to control the narrative of the war, to promote positivity, impede negativity. They're not doing that because they're fascist assholes who just like hiding the truth, they're doing it to make the situation appear better for their people and supporters to keep morale up. If they're honest and up-front then morale plummets so at the very least they massage facts to give them a positive spin. 

It's why when Zelensky recently mentioned casualty figures it was so shocking. UA couldn't hide that anymore as it was too many, they had to come clean regardless of what it did to morale or else he loses credibility he can't afford to lose. 

But what if that's the new reality for this war? With future ops being closer in casualty rates to the Severodonetsk salient meat grinder than compared to the lighter casualties they'd taken in phase 1, there is no telling what the future brings. Especially since once they go on the attack it'll be a flip, it'll be them doing motorized attacks against Russian mined defensive positions guarded by a hell of a lot of ATGMs with IFV and tanks counterattacking, all while not having air superiority. It's possible it'll be a cake walk.

See, for example, Trump’s trash talking of NATO and America’s military presence across the world.

&gt; * …battlefield results demonstrated the poor fit of Russian operational philosophies in an expeditionary warfare setting: Friendly fire, lack of dynamic targeting, minimal freedom of access, and poor theater-wide C2 together indicated the need for the VKS to introduce enabler aircraft and experiment with new CONEMP in Syria. 

&gt; * …Russia demonstrated the ability to rapidly field a high volume of “attritable UAVs for artillery support,” a model that it will likely sustain in future ground-based operations. 

&gt; * There is some evidence, however, that the VKS’s ongoing challenges in consistently closing the reconnaissance-strike loop and in effectively delivering precision effects have led the VKS to increase its use of UAV-driven targeting for precision-strike missions and to invest in several new technologies.43 The VKS and Russian Army have tested “light drones with designators” and are currently developing several unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) variants.44 

&gt; * Russian military’s CONEMP for its deployed UAVs came at the expense of a well-developed penetrating ISR capability. Some observers have cited this deficiency as a primary factor in the regime’s devastating loss of Palmyra to ISIS and in early opposition gains in Idlib.45 The UAV constellation appeared to be neither capable of reliably generating sufficient ISR to enable on-demand defensive CAS nor designed for penetrating ISR coverage. As noted, these shortfalls likely contributed to major battlefield losses against lower- end opponents in this counterinsurgency setting, raising doubts about Russia’s expected level of overall operational effectiveness in a future fight against higher-end opponents. 

&gt; * “sorties by Tu-22M3s with unguided bombs were much cheaper.” 

&gt; * The VKS’s hub-and-spokes basing approach for helicopter units demonstrated effective adaptability to the operational setting and enabled the VKS to efficiently allocate resources. 

&gt; * An attack by ISIS on Tiyas air base in May 2016 destroyed four Russian Mi-24/35 helicopters. 

&gt; * The Su-25 was a key exception: the combination of technical deficiencies (minimal targeting and self-protection capabilities), aircrew inexperience, and a smaller combat radius significantly hindered the Su-25’s ability to consistently and effectively provide CAS in more geographically remote counter-ISIS operations. 

&gt; * Many analysts of Russian military strategy have observed that the VKS was sensitive to the risks that aircrew quality and inexperience posed to early air operations.11 Friendly fire, pilot errors, poor targeting, and technical failures afflicted Russian air operations early in the campaign. 

&gt; * Russia’s increasing comfort with and reliance on unmanned aerial ISR throughout the campaign compensated for its relative dearth of ground- based intelligence and targeting capabilities in the deserts of eastern Syria. This enabled the VKS to “establish a more effective ‘kill chain’ and to improve reaction time from detection to target destruction,” a critical enabler for Russia’s ability to “send helicopters for free hunting to established ‘kill zones’ during day and night.” 

&gt; * In March 2016, for instance, the VKS shifted away from older-model Su-25 aircraft and Mi-24P attack helicopters, which had entailed operational risks and technical deficiencies that were unsuited to a CAS role in counter-ISIS operations. Russia’s deployment of its most advanced attack helicopters that same month immediately improved operational effectiveness, leading to a decisive victory over ISIS in Palmyra. Subsequently, the upgraded Su-25SM injected comparable advances in CAS effectiveness to Russian counter-ISIS operations. 

&gt; * As effective as Russian airpower was at enabling the Syrian regime to degrade the opposition, it would therefore be misleading to suggest that Russian airpower was uniquely powerful or decisive against ISIS in Syria. 

&gt; * This tasking decision again likely reflected Russia’s relatively limited stock of costly Kh-101 and Kh-555 satellite-guided cruise missiles. Whereas about 80 percent of munitions dropped in the first months of the campaign were unguided, some estimates for the entire air campaign range as high as 95 percent.23 In fact, sea-launched cruise missiles likely constituted Russia’s most consistent form of precision strike in Syria. 

&gt; * …our review of discrepancies in official Russian strike numbers indicate that the Russian government likely significantly overstates its published data. We suspect that official Russian strike releases are probably a better proxy for weapon releases than targets destroyed. 

&gt; * …another interpretation is that Russia was strategically risk averse (aside from engaging in risky maneuvers for specific tactical purposes). The VKS’s “limited liability, limited risk” approach acknowledged the risks of escalation; the VKS was particularly sensitive to aircrew inexperience and aircraft technical limitations. Deadly encounters with peer forces, as when a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24, led the VKS to make significant adjustments to its operational planning and TTPs, such as deploying advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. Therefore, the deliberate, sequential nature of Russia’s air campaign was plausibly driven by Russia’s reluctance to escalate with a peer adversary. In this view, the deconfliction line was no less important to Russia’s ability to adhere to its lean expeditionary approach than it was to the United States, despite Russia’s periodic willingness to attempt asymmetric maneuvers against Coalition forces. 

&gt; * Although Russian airpower emerged as a key enabler of the regime’s erosion of ISIS control in eastern Syria, Russian airpower was neither primarily responsible for the Syrian regime’s recapture of Deir al-Zour nor uniquely effective against ISIS.

[],False,,MarshalWillKane,,,[],,,,text,t2_dla6h,False,False,"This report came out recently and it uses the clarity of time passing to take a look at the Russian air force in Syria; for their effect on ISIS and their performance overall.  

There are a lot of lessons on Russian air power in this report. In fact it is surprising to read the report and realize how much they are trying to fight the war in Ukraine with the same force and the same strategy (at times in the war). 

If you have any interest in modern air power and Russian military power in general, then I would recommend this report or at least the summaries on the link, or my quotes here. 

---------------

&gt; * Russian airpower was not uniquely powerful or decisive against ISIS. The U.S. Coalition conducted at least 50 percent more airstrikes, in aggregate, than did Russia in ISIS-controlled regions in north, central, and eastern Syria. 

&gt; * It is unclear how effectively Russia might be able to export its expeditionary capability to other theaters. The geography in Syria was uniquely favorable for the VKS’s reliance on rotary-wing operations, the conflict was low intensity, and Russian forces rarely encountered adversaries with advanced air-to-air or surface-to-air capabilities. 
&gt; * Shortly before Russia’s military intervention in the Syrian civil war in September 2015, the Syrian government controlled less than one-fifth of the country’s territory and many Russian analysts believed that the regime’s collapse was imminent. 

&gt; * In spite of the limitations of commercial GEOINT, we nonetheless found it to be the most rigorous, consistent, and verifiable source of information regarding Russia’s aircraft deployments. We therefore compiled all publicly available satellite imagery of Russian air bases in Syria from September 2015 through March 2018. 

&gt; * Unfortunately, Russia is a notoriously poor source of information on its operations. Not only does the Ministry of Defense (MoD) make very little systematic data available to the public, but it often traffics in falsehoods for strategic or institutional purposes. For example, the MoD repeatedly lied about the flight path of the Su-24 shot down by a Turkish F-16 in November 2015. 

&gt; * Together, our estimation and bounding procedures facilitated a comparison—in rough orders of magnitude—between the intensity of Russian and Coalition airstrikes. 

&gt; * After a modicum of success in the autumn of 2014, Syrian government-aligned forces did not fare well in the early months of 2015. We analyzed operational outcomes in the Syrian conflict and found that the regime did not win a decisive victory in any of its nine major operations in 2015 

&gt; * Meanwhile, the Kremlin watched the events unfold in Syria with a growing sense of alarm.8 ISIS’s capture of Palmyra in May 2015 was a symbolic turning point for Russia’s perception of the conditions on the ground. Then, in July, Turkey granted the “U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition” access to its air bases, a decision that was swiftly denounced by Iran as an infringement of Syrian state “sovereignty.”9 Some observers have concluded that Russia’s decision to intervene crystallized in the wake of multiple visits to Moscow in July by the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, Maj Gen Qassem Soleimani.10 Russia appears to have been receptive to such concerns given the proximity of its Tartus naval facility, one of the only military facilities it still possessed outside of the Russian near-abroad, to the encroaching rebel forces in Latakia. The prospect of a U.S.-led “safe zone” near Tartus likely contributed to the Russian calculus vis-à-vis military intervention.11 

&gt; * Perhaps most importantly, Russia viewed U.S.-backed regime change as a threat to its national security. Therefore, Russia viewed preserving the Assad regime not only as a vital symbolic objective for Russia but as a linchpin of Russian national security. Other key driving forces behind Russia’s decision to intervene included restricting U.S. freedom of action in Syria and preempting the sort of Western “adventurism” it had perceived in Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine. 

&gt; * Countering ISIS was, in contrast, only a subsidiary objective in Russia’s decision to intervene in Syria. 

&gt; * Borshchevskaya observes that Russia’s approach to counterterrorism operations in Syria—the belief that “anyone who is armed and opposes Assad is a terrorist”—was consistent with the Kremlin’s “historic definition of terrorism and approach to it.”30 The very notion of a “moderate” Syrian opposition, Russian analysts have contended, is a misnomer, since many Western-backed rebel groups have overt ties to Jabhat al-Nusra and other Islamist organizations. 

&gt; * The air campaign’s early workhorse in counteropposition strike missions was the older Su-24M variant. Some observers have argued that the VKS’s early employment of older-model aircraft bespoke its primary operational aims— namely to degrade the Syrian opposition in northwest Syria by inflicting indiscriminate damage in order to stanch the opposition’s momentum and restrict its transport and supply lines in Latakia and Hama.35 

&gt; * Many strike operations early in the campaign involved preplanned, static targets, often in urban areas.36 Most published estimates suggest that over 80 percent of ordnance delivered in the first months of Russian air operations was unguided, with Su-24s and Su-25s typically dropping free-falling “dumb bombs” with minimal target identification. 

&gt; * The second watershed event occurred on November 24, when a Turkish F-16 jet shot down a Russian Su-24 in Turkish airspace.44 In response, the VKS launched two Mi-8AMTSh-V transport helicopters, along with a single Mi-24P attack helicopter providing top cover, in a combat search and rescue (CSAR) mission to rescue the downed two-man crew.45 Because the deployed Mi-24 attack helicopters were only daylight-capable, the mission occurred in “broad daylight,” and all three helicopters were targeted by ground fire in insurgent territory. Both Mi-8s were damaged in the operation, and one subsequently crashed. 

&gt; * Moreover, the desert terrain and dearth of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) among ISIS forces made the conditions ideal for operational testing of relatively new systems.65 

&gt; * Indeed, the Kremlin viewed the prospect of Assad stepping down as a serious threat to Russian national security. As Charap et al. note, Assad’s downfall “was understood to mean both a victory for the forces of transnational terrorism (and thus an increased terrorist threat to Russia) and a legitimization of Western-backed regime change, which also represented a threat to Russia’s national security.” 

&gt; * The consensus among most observers is that the actual operational impact of Russian naval aviation was minimal, if not outright disastrous. 

&gt; * Russian strategic priorities had evolved from saving the Assad regime and supplanting U.S. geopolitical influence to protecting the VKS’s expeditionary infrastructure, experimenting with new capabilities and operational concepts, and observing NATO TTPs in counter-ISIS operations. 

&gt; * The introduction of the Su-25 in a CAS role in Deir al-Zour, complementing the forward- stationed attack helicopter units, provided an important advantage for Syrian ground forces against ISIS. Whereas the performance record of the Su-25 in Syria had been mixed during its initial deployment, the VKS made several improvements in operational planning and TTPs to enhance the aircraft’s effectiveness in a CAS role. Most importantly, the VKS had significantly improved joint operations planning, airborne command and control (C2), ISR, and air-to-ground communications with SAA ground forces. The VKS also deployed an upgraded variant of the platform—the Su-25SM3—that featured enhanced avionics, communications, navigation and attack precision, and weapons suites. The Su-25 thus proved to be much more effective…

&gt; * Two decades of observing Western warfighting innovations, beginning with the first Gulf War, fundamentally altered Russian military doctrine and operational art. 

&gt; * Russian strategic planners viewed the Syria conflict as an ideal operational setting in which to apply the central tenets of both NGW and the strategy of limited action. 

&gt; * This approach aligned with conventional Russian operational planning, which delineated near- and medium-range from long-range strike operations. 

&gt; * The heavy representation of older Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft variants among the deployed force reflected prevailing VKS doctrine, CONEMP demonstrated in recent air campaigns (e.g., Georgia, Chechnya), and the prevalence of aging aircraft in Russia’s fixed-wing combat aircraft inventory. 
&gt; * Strikes were conducted by “pairs of aircraft,” consistent with Russian TTPs. 

&gt; * …aircrew inexperience was a significant constraint on VKS operational planning, and Russian air operations initially prioritized minimizing risk and limiting aircrew burdens. 

&gt; * A key lesson learned from Russia’s recent operational experiences in Georgia and Chechnya was the importance of air-to-ground integration.26 To this end, Russia heavily used Spetsnaz forces early in the Syrian intervention for “target acquisition and designation for airstrikes,” ground-based ISR, ground-to-air communications, and battle damage assessment (BDA).27 Initial airstrikes were “largely pre-planned on static targets,” confined to the “immediate frontline” of the Syrian conflict.",e2e86f93ebc98397810d1e7f2bb2a5bfccc62ba4,True,False,,,,,0,1654614491,,0,{},ibhtupo,True,t3_v6y25j,False,True,t3_v6y25j,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6y25j/road_to_damascus_the_russian_air_campaign_in/ibhtupo/,1654614510,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654585691.0

They're depleting their materiel, and lack the ability to meaningfully resupply between industrial capacity and the sanctions cutting off supplies necessary for their best equipment.

Also, as bad as the sanctions have been so far, a lot of the effects were longer term, so even without the imposition of any new terms, they will continue to get worse with every month they are held.

On the other hand, Ukraine is continuing to get resupplied with weapons from the west, and is arguably *better* equipped now than when they started. Not just in numbers, but in technical sophistication - a lot of the equipment they received is from former Warsaw Pact countries that had since joined NATO but had been heavily upgraded since, so you have things like Poland giving them significantly upgraded and well maintained T-72s.

There's also something of a Boiling The Frog effect going on with the materiel going to Ukraine. In the beginning, NATO countries donated small arms and intelligence, then anti-tank weapons, then armor, then you're starting to see more and more advanced systems more oriented toward strike roles, like anti ship missiles and HIMARS/MLRS rocket artillery.

Some equipment is just point and shoot. But the vast majority requires days, weeks, or months of training in the case of extremely complicated systems like aircraft. For just regular firearms you should have a lot of experience shooting it and taking it apart for maintenance. This may take days of practice to be truly trained on it properly, though of course most can grasp the basics within an hour or a few at most.

You're right that armies can be trained in months, but that's basic training not more specialized training required for advanced functions like demolition, maintenance of trucks or artillery systems, or AA systems.

In Syria, Russia’s initial attempts to quickly advance along many axes also met with little success. So, in a move intended to deceive opponents, Putin announced a withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria in March 2016. Russian and Syrian troops from then on focused their offensives on one target at a time, concentrating first on Palmyra, then Aleppo, then the eastern and central regions, and finally turning north to Idlib. Setting clear operative priorities and conquering one region at a time, Russia decisively expanded the territory controlled after a “withdrawal” that heralded merely an operational pause.

The maximum density, or maximum number of aircraft you can operate, is filling the hangar to capacity (leaving fire curtain paths clear so you can divide the hangar into separate bays), packing the entire flight deck except the area, plus one for the last aircraft to land. Normally you want to operate at around 80% of the maximum density to make moving aircraft easier and reserve dedicated maintenance areas, and most of the time nations round this further to standard squadron sizes. You can occasionally find references to these in some documents.

For helicopters, you only need a single safe area to take off and land. I don’t recall seeing actual maximum density values for any helicopter on any carrier.

I have not done a sufficient analysis of the *Essex* class or any carrier that operated Buccaneers or Gannets to answer that side of the question. Maximum density calculations are difficult and the *Essex* hangar was not a convenient shape, so slight changes to aircraft dimensions can have major effects. By the 1950s the Royal Navy had also moved away from treating all folded aircraft as a box with the dimensions you provide (though you did not account for folding wings, a critical oversight), further complicating matters (this is now standard practice, though makes analysis of WWII British carriers much easier).

You really need a physical model of the hangar and aircraft to scale to make this calculation, at least with my current skill set. 3D modeling could work, but I’m rather rusty and need a refresher.

However, for the Phantom we can cheat. The US rated the six SCB-27C/125 ships as capable of operating the F4H-1/F-4B, with the SCB-27A/125 *Intrepid* performing some of the tests. These ships never carried F-4s in service (I’ve never seen a trials photo) and later versions were too heavy, but I’ll assume the F-4K was sufficiently similar that the British would accept using them on the two angled deck proposed transfers. *Leyte*, however, would be restricted to Gannets and older jets, at least not without a costly rebuild.

The [1963 F4H-1 Standard Aircraft Characteristics](http://www.alternatewars.com/SAC/F4H-1_SAC_-_1_February_1963.pdf) includes this line:

&gt;A total of 57 aircraft can be accommodated in a landing spot on the flight and hangar decks of a CVA-19 class angled deck carrier (Flight 30; Hangar 27 airplanes)

That’s with only Phantoms aboard, and for a standard 75-80% load we’re looking at 42-46 at most, probably rounded down to three squadrons (36 aircraft) plus some supporting aircraft. Given the number of Phantoms ordered, two squadrons with 24 aircraft would be more typical.

The Gannet similar in shape and size to the A-1 Skyraider, but about 5 feet longer on the gear and 5 feet narrower when folded from what I can quickly find. The AD-6 was rated for 42 aircraft on the flight deck and 41 in the hangar, 83 total, so the Gannet would likely be similar (though with a +/-15% margin of error, maximum density 71-96).",1b79db4ad000f4dbb2f8ac151d1723da2dfc85db,True,False,,,,,0,1654608078,,0,{},ibhga8q,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t1_ibe35cp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibhga8q/,1654608097,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654579278.0

well yes, that would indeed be an escalation, however, no one I've listed to [nor any source I've read](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF) says that's on the table or indicated in the future, I'm including [Russia's own nuclear doctrine in this.](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf)

that sounds a lot like media-fueled will speculation (as does the tactical nuke bit) do you have any sources at all that back up your concerns as i would be interested to read them?

Escalation to me would mean increasing pressure on russias part for force this war either physically, socially or financially outside of the borders of the UE and thereby involving other countries more directly... i think were seeing them start to do that with the steel and grain at the moment.

Yep, and although their bombardment did a lot of damage to air field facilities it did very little to the dug in troops defending Henderson Field.

Yes actually. If the initial assault had gotten chewed up they wouldn't have been able to mount a second attack. Even if they had been the Japanese were all about the Mahanian decisive battle. There is no way they were going to sail their precious battleships to within sight of Midway. The whole point of the operation was to hold the main force back in order to lure the Americans out to battle.

But, talking about the ability for the US and its allies to effectively use deception, the one example that really comes to mind is the ""Left Hook"" of the Gulf War.

[Deception in the Desert: Deceiving Iraq in Operation Desert Storm](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Books/Browse-Books/iBooks-and-EPUBs/Deception-in-the-Desert/):

&gt; In October, General Schwarzkopf’s planners initially conceived of an air-land offensive that relied on the forces immediately available in Saudi Arabia and the region...The early versions of the plan offered a straightforward concept: after an air offensive destroyed command networks as well as other strategic targets and attrited Iraq’s ground units, Coalition forces would attack along three axes directly into Kuwait.

&gt; Because much of the combat power in the plan came from XVIII Airborne Corps, this became known as the “One Corps” concept. After the war, **Schwarzkopf described the “One Corps” concept as a “straight-up-the-middle charge right into the teeth of the Iraqi defenses” that lacked any element of surprise and would likely incur “substantial” Coalition casualties**, threatening popular support at home.

&gt; On 11 October, the CENTCOM staff briefed this plan to President George H. W. Bush and his national security staff. **Neither Bush nor his advisors were comfortable with the “One Corps” concept and encouraged Schwarzkopf to be more imaginative**. Four days later, the CENTCOM commander told his planners to develop a new concept for the offensive that included a second US Army armored corps. **Schwarzkopf’s new vision featured a bold envelopment of Iraqi forces from west of the Kuwait border.**

&gt; In what eventually became known as the “Left Hook,” the newly-added armored corps would then move quickly north from its attack positions west of the Kuwaiti border (on the Coalition left flank) into Iraq and strike deep to the Euphrates River thereby cutting off Iraqi forces in Kuwait... **The new “Two Corps” concept—with the envelopment force as the new main effort—drew its viability from the element of surprise**. To help guarantee this, the CENTCOM commander and staff **began to develop a complex deception plan designed to mask Coalition intent at the operational and tactical levels**. From CENTCOM’s perspective, the Coalition effort could not succeed unless the Iraqis had been deceived about the true scheme of the offensive campaign.

I'm not quite sure what to conclude from this. One the one hand, the initial plan was unimaginative, unambitious, eschewed deception in favor of massed firepower, combined arms and logistics, and it was only after the President was briefed (and didn't like it) that the plan was changed.

On the other hand, CENTCOM hadn't been happy with the plan either, and once they got the go ahead to think a little outside the box they quickly pivoted to the new plan which was executed to great success.

It's obviously not true that the west is incapable of using deception, but I think there might be a grain of truth to the thesis that, at least at the operational and strategic level, western nations have an inclination to do the straightforward and obvious and rely on superior technology, training and excellence in execution, and that this comes at the expense of overlooking opportunities for deception.",02480f5079aeb2c125bf3e1869caee0e83f60c62,True,False,,,,,0,1654575375,,0,{},ibg9k4s,False,t3_v6elc5,False,True,t3_v6elc5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6elc5/element_of_surprise_the_west_needs_to_be_more/ibg9k4s/,1654575393,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654546575.0

One of the single strongest, most consistent result in the IR literature is that of the democratic peace, and a big component of that is the fact that policymaking is happening in the open, which reduces uncertainty and prevents escalation. 

A close finding behind that is that democracies perform better in war because they are far more selective in which conflicts they engage in.

Taken altogether, this suggests that Ukraine is losing over 350-700 KIA and 3,500 WIA per week in the East. Add in casualties taken in other areas (Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv) and Ukraine must be absorbing at least 5,000 combat losses per week, and perhaps a few thousands more.

Compare to Ukraine's claims for Russian and DPR/LPR losses during that period: 1,100 men for the week of May 19-26 and 1,250 men for the week of May 26-June 2. It's unclear whether those figures are only for KIA, but given aforementioned Ukrainian numbers its probably the case - although it might be somewhat inflated, as claims tend to be.

I think that's probably true, but the only alternatives would appear to be:

(a) educate the public better so that they elect leaders on better terms -- this is a good idea but the investment won't pay off for 25 years; or

(b) eliminate democracy so that leaders don't have to cater to a mass constituency.

Yes, friend or foe identifiers(IFF) that integral to both aerial assets and AA assets. Which is why it's unlikely that Russia is having blue-on-blue incidents between their SAMs and aircraft, as they all have IFF. Even the 40 year old Igla has a optional IFF, and Russia has little need to use MANPADS being that they have many types of SAM systems. The AIM-92 Stinger is available with IFF as well, it is the large folding antenna that expands at the front of the tube. Being Ukraine wasn't integrated into NATO their IFF systems aren't compatible with NATO weapons being supplied, or are incapable of squawking the proper encoded response.

&gt; * Both supporters and critics make claims about the impacts of strikes, but these are often based on armchair theories that rely on minimal or selective empirical evidence. There are, however, more than sixty studies on targeted killing in general, including the US campaign in particular, that have the potential to offer insights. My new book Drone Strike: Analyzing the Impacts of Targeted Killing reviews this research, along with extensive al-Qaeda correspondence, in order to identify what we do and do not know about the impacts of targeted strikes on terrorist groups, civilian casualties, and local populations.

&gt; * First, the US targeted strike campaign has not caused the decline of al-Qaeda or reduced the number of attacks by the group worldwide. 

&gt; *  Research suggests that targeting leadership early in the life of a militant group is more likely to cause a group to collapse. As groups age, however, many develop quasi-bureaucratic features that make them resilient in the face of targeting.

&gt; * …qualitative evidence, especially from al-Qaeda correspondence, indicates that strikes in Pakistan significantly weakened top al-Qaeda leadership, known as al-Qaeda core (AQC). Along with substantial strengthening of other counterterrorism measures, this probably contributed to reducing the risk of al-Qaeda attacks against the “far enemy” in the United States and the West.

&gt; * More than half the major terrorist plots against the West between 2004 and 2011, for instance, had links to Pakistan. 

&gt; *  studies of targeting in Pakistan generally, although not uniformly, indicate that strikes can have local effects by reducing the number of terrorist attacks and fatalities for one to four weeks in locations where strikes occur. Researchers suggest that this is a function of both “kinetic” effects from the loss of valuable individuals and “anticipatory effects” that reflect changes in terrorist operations to avoid strikes that render those operations less efficient.

&gt; * Strikes by themselves will not necessarily permanently weaken a terrorist group, but they may reduce violence enough to create the opportunity to pursue initiatives that could do so. 

&gt; * In 2013, the United States adopted targeting standards that have reduced civilian casualties. My calculations, based on New America’s database, for instance, find that 11.2 percent of casualties were civilians from 2002 to 2012, while 3.5 percent were from 2013 to 2020.

&gt; * Next, research consistently finds that there is strong local opposition to drone strikes in the areas in which they occur. The most rigorous research does not, however, support the claim that this translates into greater support for terrorist groups and increases in terrorist recruitment.

&gt; * This suggests that even if AQC regroups in Afghanistan, it may not be feasible for strikes to play as prominent a role as they did in Pakistan.

&gt; * Second, without efforts to analyze and address the underlying causes of extremism, the most that strikes may accomplish on the local level is, as Israel puts it, to “mow the grass.”

&gt; * Finally, analysts and policymakers need to appreciate the limits of empirical research. It can inform, but not substitute for, judgments about the legal and ethical justifiability of targeted strikes. Nonetheless, it’s important to affirm the value of research that aims to provide the best possible understanding of life and death matters in a complex world.

Ukrainians and Belarusians both also learn Russian in schools, while Russians obviously don't learn any Ukrainian or Belarusian. Consecutively, this translates into Ukrainians and Belarusians being universally fluent in Russian, while Russians may have a hard time understanding both Ukrainian or Belarusian -- nevermind trying actually to speak in one of those! This, coupled with Russian 'big brother' mentality over its neighbours, had translated into Russians branding both Ukrainian and Belarusian languages as 'hillbilly' languages that nobody needs because everyone knows Russian anyway. 

Ukrainian language also has some [shibboleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth), which are really helpful now during the war. I.e.: [palianytsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palianytsia), which is a really simple word for any Ukrainian to say, but somehow makes most Russians trying to say it without training lose any grip they'd have on any similarities between Russian and Ukrainian languages.

[],False,,Voteins,,,[],,,,text,t2_12yjl9,False,False,"While this is an excellent paper, I think it makes a few errors in looking at the historical counterfactuals. imo they fail to prove their central argument that the Battle of Midway was unwinnable for Japanese, and that the Japanese actually performed better than the modal prediction.

The paper totally discounts the effect of MAGIC intercepts in ensuring the very presence of American carriers on June 4th. This is extremely important, the entire Japanese plan of operations was based around the idea of ""luring out"" the American carriers *after* they had taken Midway island. Japanese intel was firmly convinced the they were still in the region of Papua New Guinea, and wouldn't arrive at Midway until several days after the initial Japanese attack. The Americans worked extremely hard to encourage that belief, including deliberately allowing Japanese scout planes to sight the American fleet near the Coral Sea on May 15th, a week after that battle had concluded. All things considered, the Japanese reacted quicker than might be expected considering encountering the American carriers was complete and total surprise.

I would have liked to see a counterfactual with the Japanese engaging and defeating the Midway garrison, and then their remaining forces fighting an entirely an separate engagement with the American carriers. Once could even take this deeper and look at a second counterfactual with not just this, but also reducing Midway's defenses to what it had prior to the Americans discovering it would soon be targeted by the Japanese, after which its air wing and AA defenses were significantly reinforced. The paper indicates even the first scenario would have been much more favorable for the Japanese.

Also, the Japanese carriers didn't sink any American ones during the battle. The Yorktown was hit and heavily damaged, but was a damage control party was able to stabilize her and she was under tow back to Peal Harbor before being struck by two torpedoes from the I-168. This paper doesn't include submarines in its equations and so the actual outcome of the battle was 4-0 in America's favor, which was the modal prediction.

The story of Midway is ultimately one of the Americans successfully luring the Japanese into a losing battle through superior intelligence. But the efforts of the codebreakers were classified until the 1960s, by which point the wartime story of the Americans being ""lucky"" to have had their entire carrier force coincidentally parked in the perfect spot to stop a surprise Japanese attack was firmly established.",f2f0e7830ad2b1b1c35809e2aa181223bfbc6520,True,False,,,,,0,1654564114,,0,{},ibfok3g,False,t3_v654yz,False,True,t3_v654yz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v654yz/revisiting_the_battle_of_midway_a_counterfactual/ibfok3g/,1654564129,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654535314.0
[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"So, if I am reading this correctly, the author is trying to justify the doctrine of ""pre-emptive action"".

While I can see the logic of the argument that he is putting forward, there are equally a number of counterarguments against them. Moreover, the logic and doctrine of pre-emption is very dangerous in a world littered with nuclear weapons (and possibly other kinds of WMD).

Thus, for example, (1) the logic of pre-emptive action disregards or underplays the problem of conflict escalation - the retaliatory action of the nation-state on which a preemtive action is undertaken may seek to expand not simply the scope of the war, but also escalate the conflict from a conventional one to one involving WMD; (2) it puts not simply nation-states and NSAs at risk, but also, when handled by very misguided people/governments, even populations at risk (we have seen this in the past. Hitler's extermination program of the Jews (but also the Slavs) was often justified at the time on the basis of a preemtive action); (3) the doctrine of pre-emption presumes an imminent threat, which involves ""threat perception"". But this has its own problems because what one perceives as a threat may not be a real threat (for example, let's say a US carrier battlegroup sails in the EEZ of a country and conducts aggressive ""training operations"" therein. Would the country in whose EEZ this is taking place consider it to be a threatening act and should that country engage the US battle group in active operations?); (4) the doctrine of pre-emption can be used to justify any act of violence even though in theory the onus of justification rests on the aggressor nation. (We saw exactly how this played out during the 2nd Gulf War).

On the question of surprise, as the author points out, tactical surprise remains a key element in (at least initial) military successes. Strategic surprise, on the other hand, is a more difficult and complicated proposition.

For the West (especially, the US) this is more so because it is the dominant power. This, paradoxically, reduces flexibility because since the dominant power has already established a ""rules based order"", it is that which it has to defend.

Sure, but this is largely because they were largely facing the Japanese alone. If the island's air wing was attacking simultaneously (or near enough for WWII comms), they might have had more impact.

But also, the performance of huge chunks of the carrier-based aircraft at Midway was also negligible. Nevertheless, the sheer number of aircraft was essential in allowing the aircraft that actually *could* do damage to the Japanese carriers to eventually find their mark.

&gt;this seems like the kind of counterfactual analysis that is so subjective.

I do agree that counterfactuals are actually all pretty bullshit. That said, to the extent they're even worth considering, Midway seems tilted towards the American forces on every level.

&gt;\-Russian forces likely retain control over most of Severodonetsk as of June 6, though the exact situation in the city remains unclear. Control of terrain is likely changing hands frequently.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Russian forces in the Izyum area did not make any confirmed advances, while forces advancing west from Lyman secured minor gains.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Russian forces continued unsuccessful attempts to sever Ukrainian lines of communication northeast of Bakhmut.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Limited and localized Ukrainian counterattacks on June 5 forced Russian troops to focus on holding defensive lines north of Kharkiv City on June 6.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Russian occupation authorities are advancing efforts to issue Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens and cement their control over occupied territories.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-The Ukrainian Navy claimed to have pushed the Russian Black Sea Fleet more than 100 km from the Ukrainian coast, likely to reduce the pressure of the Russian blockade on Ukraine’s southern ports.",2a190856f1b1d6f4b380a808ba7b49a6067ad558,True,False,,,,,0,1654561175,,0,{},ibfip3h,False,t3_v61vur,False,True,t3_v61vur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_06_2022/ibfip3h/,1654561189,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654532375.0
