A lot of companies are moving towards the idea of decentralised grids. For example, some companies now offer schemes where they have control of your home battery system, storing when cheap and selling when high in exchange for paying you a bit more on your solar excess.

Electric car schemes are now in trial when cars are used in the same way, charging when cheap and discharging when expensive. Think charging your car over night when power is cheap, driving it to work, plugging it in, powering your house during peak dinner time, then charging again. At the weekend, your solar panels give your parked car a big free top up.

In my country, farmers are putting up wind turbines in their fields, losing very little land productivity and further decentralising the grid.

There are also breweries, sanitation plants selling natural gas back to grids as either electricity or just straight up natural gas, making use of a product that would have otherwise been wasted.

Since wind and solar are so cheap for individual consumers (as they dont need to pay back up), there is incentive and good pay back times. With private companies joining in, the future of the electricity grid will be more decentralised than it ever has been. 

My personal opinion is the geopolitical impacts of this could be significant by 2050 with the right policies. For example, government loans to support role out of solar on all rooves, combined with huge hydro electric storage could provide a mountainous country its entire energy needs.",8b1500a85d7aba46b1b2edeb0a579d32ae956168,True,False,,,,,0,1654645818,,0,{},ibjr9nf,False,t3_v6xh36,False,True,t1_ibjo38f,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6xh36/the_new_energy_order_how_governments_will/ibjr9nf/,1654645833,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654617018.0,

Violently suppressing peaceful protesters isn't the problem. [Bahrain even called in allies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tDZIawJz4M) to help torture and kill their protesters.

It's called [Weaponizing Human Rights](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000160-6c37-da3c-a371-ec3f13380001) - if the US perceives a country as hostile, human rights are championed. If the regime is friendly, they get a pass. 
 
&gt; The main argument against calling it the coup is that nobody from it ended up in any form of power (maybe except Klitchko but he came late to the protest and was popular regardless).

[""Yats is the guy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2XNN0Yt6D8) - that was US coup monger in chief Victoria Nuland several weeks before the coup. Yats of course became PM after the coup. 

&gt; Probably because the Houthis did not organize elections.

Remind me the last time the Saudis held elections. And also about the legal right a theocratic monarchy has to invade a country to preserve its constitutional succession. Should Russia have invaded all of Ukraine on Feb 25? 

&gt; If he didn't flee there might actually could have been a coup since the extremists where not satisfied but I doubt they would have had support to actually do anything about it.

According to Yanukovych, he fled in fear for his life from a violent mob. If a fairly elected President makes such a claim, it demands extraordinary evidence to suggest it was anything but a coup. 

&gt; This is a blatant lie and Russian propaganda, it was 5 B in help for Ukraine in total over 20 years (and only some of that was for pro western organizations).

It's like when the CIA launched a [vaccination drive](https://www.cato.org/research-briefs-economic-policy/vaccines-we-trust-effects-cias-vaccine-ruse-immunization-pakistan) in Pakistan to catch Bin Laden. The backers of these programs in Congress aren't the Bernie Sanders and AOC - they're hawks like Cruz and McCain. When Victoria Nuland left office during Trump's administration (she was disgusted at his lack of interest in regime change), she didn't go plant trees in the desert or provide drinking water - she was CEO for a ""thinktank"" [funded by weapons manufacturers and oil companies.](https://www.cnas.org/)   

&gt; Nobody is doing anything about Transnistria, Abhazia or Ossetia (well Georgia tried but that was stupid). The only country that started doing anything violently is Russia.

Start with the cycle of violence from the beginning. This cycle of violence started in Kiev - without that coup, none of this would have happened. No democracy in the world starts with burning dozens of people alive like in Odessa. Remember - all the regions of Donbas voted to *support* Ukrainian independence in 1991. Ukraine was whole until it was broken, and it was broken on Feb 24, 2014. 

&gt; The only places that prosper in Central Eastern Europe are the ones that joined NATO and the EU. 

I agree that EU offers a more prosperous future. I just don't think democracy should be subverted to get there. And if we do engage in some light coup-sponsoring, we should back off once we see that we are starting a civil war. OSCE monitored the 2010 election and said it was won fairly. That has to be respected.  

&gt; It's because the only thing Russia has to offer is threat of military destruction for disobedience. 

Russia was paying $3B a year in transit fees to Ukraine. Ukraine's entire GDP is $150B. When Ukraine had good relations with Russia, Russia also provided them with $billions in subsidies via cheap natural gas. 

&gt; How such a deal would work without a customs border inside Ukraine? 

Yes, the EU-Ukraine border would have to be maintained as it currently stands, with EU goods and citizens having free passage. It didn't have to be a deal-breaker. Maintaining a border would certainly have been cheaper than a war. 

&gt; There is now way for a country to enter the Single Market and at the same time be part of another trade agreement.

This is a viable stance when you're integrating Lithuania. It's insanely irresponsible if it means ripping up a country's existing trade ties (Russia and Ukraine were each other's #1 trade partners prior to this schism). The Donbas economy was tightly integrated with Russia, and they were told they'd be forced to give this up to pay for the nationalist adventure favored by Western Ukraine. 

&gt; I've only seen two examples of stuff hitting Donetsk one was a Tochka that was shot down over it and the other is disputed. That's not a lot of shelling for a city 10km from the front line for 8 years. Kharkiev gets more daily even after Russia retreated from it and are shooting over the border.

UAF have been [bombarding Donetsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cscSYu5Zl9c) every night for weeks now with artillery. There is no plan to launch an assault. There is no military target. It's just vengeance attacks against civilians. 

&gt; Hostile meaning not subject to Russia?

Not hosting NATO forces or Patriot batteries or F35-A. Demilitarized or neutral (but with security guarantees from countries like France, Germany, India, Poland, etc). 

&gt; It's not the shock therapy that was the problem it was(and is) their kleptocracy.

Oh I agree. Russia has a lot of work to do internally or they'll soon be a nation of peasants again, serving masters in Beijing or Berlin. That's up to them though.

I don't think it's necessarily a bad assumption. It's one possibility out of many, and I could see an argument that it might be the most likely possibility. 

We don't have a huge sample of what happens to a country when their population rapidly ages and their working population rapidly sinks, so it's hard to say authoritatively what will happen. Basic economics would lead me to believe that less workers would lead to less economic output, but it is definitely possible that something like automation could increase the efficiency of the remaining workers enough that China could still see modest economic growth. 

So rather than a bad assumption, I would say it's a natural assumption to make, and would require some significant technological advances, which are not guaranteed to be disproven.

While I agree that there are some notable differences between Japan and China (urbanization levels being a major one), there are also some large similarities too. Both countries relied heavily on a supply side and export orientated approach to growth. That approach works great as long as the rest of the world is willing to absorb excess production, but the downside is that that approach typically suppresses domestic consumption, which is seen in that China's household consumption is only 40% of GDP compared to the typical average of around 60%. 

Japan  struggled to rebalance their economy to more domestic consumption, and that was part of what lead to their lost decade. If China doesn't fix this, I think there's a good chance that their current economic growth is not sustainable and at some point they'll have an adjustment period alla Japan.

While it's technically possible for China to increase domestic consumption, I think politically it will be very difficult. Changing the economic balance in China would come at the cost of the government, the state-run corporations, and the wealthy i.e. the people in power who could change the system are the ones who would be negatively impacted by changing it. 

The West having a similar population crush if anything is likewise bad news for China. China's economy relies on exporting excess production. If the West is experiencing economic hardship due to bad demographics that will suppress demand and hurt Chinese exports.  

Like I said, nothing is written in stone, but there are serious headwinds facing China's economic future, and to write them off entirely, I think, is silly.",b2ee8ee7dcf5796fb15bbf23748240d8db8d04f6,True,False,,,,,0,1654619929,,0,{},ibi6f8q,False,t3_v6la38,False,True,t1_ibhwxgo,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6la38/beyond_weapons_time_for_a_new_us_strategy_on/ibi6f8q/,1654619947,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654591129.0,

""In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world appears to be at an inflection point. Business leaders have declared the acceleration of deglobalization and sounded the alarm about a new period of stagflation. Academics have decried the return of conquest and hailed the renewal of transatlantic ties. And countries are rethinking almost every aspect of their foreign policies, including trade, defense spending, and military alliances.  


These dramatic shifts have overshadowed another profound transformation in the global energy system. For the last two decades, the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions has gradually reshaped the global energy order. Now, as a result of the war in Ukraine, energy security has returned to the fore, joining climate change as a top concern for policymakers. Together, these dual priorities are poised to reshape national energy planning, energy trade flows, and the broader global economy. Countries will increasingly look inward, prioritizing domestic energy production and regional cooperation even as they seek to transition to net-zero carbon emissions. If countries retreat into strategic energy blocs, a multidecade trend toward more energy interconnectedness risks giving way to an age of energy fragmentation.  


But in addition to economic nationalism and deglobalization, the coming energy order will be defined by something that few analysts have fully appreciated: government intervention in the energy sector on a scale not seen in recent memory. After four decades during which they generally sought to curb their activity in energy markets, Western governments are now recognizing the need to play a more expansive role in everything from building (and retiring) fossil fuel infrastructure to influencing where private companies buy and sell energy to limiting emissions through carbon pricing, subsidies, mandates, and standards.

This shift is bound to invite comparisons to the 1970s, when excessive government intervention in energy markets exacerbated repeated energy crises. The dawning era of government intervention won’t be a bad thing, however, if managed correctly. Appropriately limited and tailored to address specific market failures, it can forestall the worst effects of climate change, mitigate many energy security risks, and help manage the biggest geopolitical challenges of the coming energy transition. The current energy crisis has refocused the world’s attention on geopolitical energy risks, forcing a reckoning between tomorrow’s climate ambitions and today’s energy needs and offering a preview of the tumultuous era ahead. How governments respond to these challenges, brought into sharp relief by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will shape the new energy order for decades to come.""",90197c6c19c07a04b338209e48bfe4a88b72f7e6,True,False,,,,,0,1654612915,,0,{},ibhqb8c,True,t3_v6xh36,False,True,t3_v6xh36,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6xh36/the_new_energy_order_how_governments_will/ibhqb8c/,1654612929,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654584115.0,

Maybe he should have started negotiations with not beating and shooting protesters. Failed attempts to disperse the protests by force is what escalated this.

&gt;But that's the problem with a coup - the supporters of a coup always find some reason not to call it a coup. 

The main argument against calling it the coup is that nobody from it ended up in any form of power (maybe except Klitchko but he came late to the protest and was popular regardless).  

&gt;Endorsing the violent removal of an elected leader should have given the West pause. 

He was not violently deposed because he run away, not from direct violence but from potential criminal charges he would face. 

&gt;he US spent a decade trying to help the Saudis return Yemen's elected President to power after he was forced to flee. Why was Yemen's election so sacrosanct, while Ukraine's was not? 

Probably because the Houthis did not organize elections.

&gt; According to Victoria Nuland, the US spent $5B on helping the pro-EU, pro-West side to take control. 

This is a blatant lie and Russian propaganda, it was 5 B in help for Ukraine in total over 20 years (and only some of that was for pro western organizations). 

&gt; He agreed to everything the opposition had demanded.. 

check Your links this one 404s,

He agreed and fled the same day. Only after that the parliament voted on him stoping being the president. If he didn't flee there might actually could have been a coup since the extremists where not satisfied but I doubt they would have had support to actually do anything about it. 

&gt; no racial animus from Russians when it comes to Ukrainians

there needs to be not racial animus when they commit atrocities just because. 

&gt; but the goal is to stop the fighting now. If people want to live in a throwback rump state like Transnistria, we should let them do their thing. 

Nobody is doing anything about Transnistria, Abhazia or Ossetia (well Georgia tried but that was stupid). The only country that started doing anything violently is Russia. 
 
&gt;(but we only need that if we genuinely care about these places prospering, and aren't cynically using them for power politics). 

The only places that prosper in Central Eastern Europe are the ones that joined NATO and the EU. It's because the only thing Russia has to offer is threat of military destruction for disobedience. There is a reason the populations turn to the west and it's because all western propaganda has to show is it's better standard of living and wealth. 

&gt;You're describing what would have eventually happened under Minsk,

Neither side followed the Minsk Agreements and those where nothing like what I described, Minsk would mean a permanent Russian veto on any western aspirations of the whole of Ukraine (expressed through their mouth pieces in DNR and LNR). While what I proposed would allow Kiev to go West and Donbas to the East.

&gt;What I have a problem with is Western Triumphalism. In 2013, Russia suggested a compromise on Ukraine - maybe they could preserve their trade relationship with CIS, and still pursue membership in the EU. This would have preserved the strong ties Russia had with Donbas, while still allowing Western Ukraine to puruse its vision of a future in the EU. 

How such a deal would work without a customs border inside Ukraine? I think Brexit should have showed everybody that proposal was stupid at best. There is now way for a country to enter the Single Market and at the same time be part of another trade agreement. There could have been a transitory period between signing the association agreement and EU membership but for it to work Russia would basically have to start implementing EU trade norms. 

&gt;There haven't even been any vengeance bombings of the sort that central Donestsk is subjected to. 

I've only seen two examples of stuff hitting Donetsk one was a Tochka that was shot down over it and the other is disputed. That's not a lot of shelling for a city 10km from the front line for 8 years. Kharkiev gets more daily even after Russia retreated from it and are shooting over the border.

&gt;Yes, Russia wants to wreck Ukraine as a unitary hostile state. So long as Galician nationalists can play a pivotal role, Russia will insist on federalism and demilitarization

Hostile meaning not subject to Russia? And nationalist are not in the parliament and the best thing they called Zelensky is a pro-Russian stooge so how can they play a pivotal role in anything beside Russian excuses.  

&gt;Yes, Russia started over from scratch 20 years ago after their disastrous experiment with the prescribed ""shock therapy"". Yes, they are much farther behind than countries that didn't go through Commie hell. 

They are much further behind countries that went through Commie hell and shock therapy but didn't steal everything (so every Warsaw Pact country and the Baltics) despite Russia much larger natural wealth.

&gt;	In a world where the big fish eat small fish and the small fish eat shrimps, Singapore must become a poisonous shrimp. 

This touches on a few points. The first aspect of it is that as a shrimp, Singapore has an absolutely microscopic strategic depth and a minuscule strategic reserve, even with mass conscription. The response to this is that Singapore’s strategy may broadly be described as “deterrence by punishment” - Singapore may lose the war, but the aggressor will suffer such a steep cost that it wouldn’t be worth the attempt. 

Their strategy has evolved in recent years from this to a “porcupine” defence, which is more of a “deterrence by denial” strategy - prevent adversaries and aggressors from even reaching Singapore by degrading their capabilities from afar using a well-trained and well-equipped Air Force to strike at targets before they can threaten the island. This has evolved even further in more recent years to a “dolphin” strategy which emphasises a rapid and targeted response to aggression - we’re talking about things like stealthy decapitation strikes against the heads of state of aggressor nations and other targeted strikes using drones and other sophisticated sensing technologies to rapidly establish and complete kill chains against enemy weak points. 

Now the thing you’ll notice about all of these strategies is that they are finely tuned for Singapore’s specific geopolitical position. It is possible to achieve overmatch against a force like the relatively poorly funded Royal Malaysian Air Force which has inferior equipment and training. Against an adversary like China, counting on being able to achieve air superiority is much less of a given. To say nothing of how absolutely suicidal it would be for an island city-state to attempt a decapitation strike against the nuclear-armed PRC (not that Singapore would even have the force projection to do so). The Singapore Armed Forces are a bespoke tool designed around a very narrow set of missions, because the country simply cannot afford to take on additional mission sets outside that narrow band - it’s too small to be able to afford that and it’s pointless to try. 

To go back to the idea of a military alliance with Japan, Taiwan and South Korea - what do those countries gain from having Singapore as an ally? Yes, Singapore occupies a stretegic choke point (the Straits of Malacca) but their political interests are not aligned. I went over this in another post but antagonising and excluding China is antithetical to their preferred environment of constructive competition between the US and China (and other partners in Asia and further abroad like Australia and Europe).

On the other side, for Japan/ROK/ROC, militarily, adding a few dozen Singaporean jets, ships and subs to the equation doesn’t change the calculus for the prospective Allies at all against China. In exchange, they’d have to be willing to get embroiled in a possible conflict against *Singapore’s* potential adversaries, namely Malaysia and Indonesia (as unlikely as this seems in today’s environment, treaty alliances have to take into account all possible contingencies) which is again not in any of their interests - they have no quarrel with any of Singapore’s potential adversaries and it’d distract them from their own much more pressing existential threats, all in exchange for what would amount to probably not more than a speed bump.

It’s simply not a mutually beneficial arrangement for any of the parties involved to enter into a formal defence pact.",5004b42a91475eb585ce046371e5c671ea46e4b3,True,False,,,,,0,1654596054,,0,{},ibgyhhz,False,t3_v6la38,False,True,t1_ibg7snb,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6la38/beyond_weapons_time_for_a_new_us_strategy_on/ibgyhhz/,1654596069,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654567254.0,

Gas is not the most important export product of Russia, oil is. Oil is both more profitable and has a much larger absolute value as a fraction of Russian exports.

Second, it's inaccurate to say that Europeans have no appetite to move away from Russian gas, it's just that the alternatives can't be realized in a matter of weeks. 

Germany has reduced the fraction of it's total gas imports from Russia from more than 50% to roughly 30% (as of May 20th), the EU as a whole has reduced Russian imports to about 25%.

The construction of two LNG terminals is underway (Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel) and set to be completed before the end of the year. The projected possible throughput both terminals will account for 30% of Russian gas imports.

Taken together that means that Germany will depend on Russian gas for 20% of its imports come winter. 

Now, losing 20% of your gas is no fun, but is probably within a margin that means no one has to freeze in their home with rationing of gas and strategic shutdowns of gas-hungry industries (contingency plans are already being made for this eventuality).

However, many Singaporeans back then are not very well educated in English. So for the average Chinese Singaporeans who are not fluent in English, they will likely consume a larger volume of media from China and thus will cultivate a more positive image of China in their minds.

The younger generations of Singaporeans, on the other hand, are more exposed to Western media and culture, and are thus more likely to view the West more positively. I, as a 22 year old Singaporean millennial, very rarely come across people my age who have optimistic views of China. They are more likely to be pro-West or indifferent towards politics.

Something tells me this survey was done with some bias towards China, intentionally or not.

Singapore forming an alliance against China is exceedingly unlikely, barring major geopolitical upsets. Here are a couple excerpts from the [Prime Minister’s speech](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-at-the-27th-International-Conference-on-the-Future-of-Asia) on the subject recently: 

&gt;	Countries must therefore also work together to strengthen their collective security.  And they must do this  beyond forming alliances and formal groupings of like-minded partners, like the Quad or the AUKUS group. Also through engagement and confidence and trust building arrangements with potential adversaries. 

&gt;	Security cooperation must also be complemented by tangible and mutually beneficial economic cooperation because countries with stakes in one another’s economic success have greater incentive to work together and to overcome problems between them.

&gt;	The US-China rivalry is inevitably affecting all countries in Asia. It is natural for some countries to be closer to one side or the other but most countries would prefer not to be forced to choose between the US and China. There will be no good outcome if Asian countries are split between two camps, each siding with one or the other. A more stable and less tense configuration is for the two powers to have overlapping circles of friends, and countries find it possible to have friends on both sides. Security and economic schemes in Asia should conduce towards this outcome.

To explain this - Singapore has much greater proximal “military” threats than the CCP. Their strategy has always been to balance Chinese and American influence in order to get the best of both worlds - they want Chinese investment in the region and the Americans to moderate the Chinese presence. For the latter point I don’t mean military presence, I mean things more like economic bullying and monopolisation. The biggest fish in the pond will always attempt to extract the best deal for itself unless there is another Fish Of Comparable Size in the same pond to compete with it. Think of it this way - if you have both America and China jostling for the favour of small countries in the reason, the small countries can get a better deal from both. In other words, the ideal situation is a form of constructive rather than destructive competition that benefits local interests. Witness how people are now trying to convince America to invest more in the Pacific, Africa and South America to offset China’s overtures, regions that would otherwise probably not garner American interests at all. Greater choice is always favourable for a buyer. 

Singapore is not like Taiwan, Japan or South Korea in that they do not have an existential fear of Chinese militarism and expansionism. This is partly historical, Singapore is a country whose relationships are more linked to the British colonial past and to their Southeast Asian neighbours. It has not defined itself by its relation to China militarily but rather in a cultural sense (which is why the other commenter is right to say that many Singaporeans especially older generations have positive views towards China). The other nations in that grouping (ROK, ROC, Japan) have all had a centuries-long history of military confrontation against or domination by Mainland China, Singapore is clearly the odd one out. 

To reiterate, Singapore prefers both China and America in the region, joining a defensive pact with Taiwan, South Korea or Japan in order to exclude China is contrary to that goal and thus highly unlikely.",46efcb3be90d010693c7553a772e0a5a1b4839c8,True,False,,,,,0,1654584927,,0,{},ibgmko4,False,t3_v6la38,False,True,t1_ibg7fxm,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6la38/beyond_weapons_time_for_a_new_us_strategy_on/ibgmko4/,1654584943,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654556127.0,

If you're looking for good sources, I think the French papers are really good, especially the defense reports from the French MoD. You can see the propaganda in the British MoD, where every failed or imaginary Ukrainian counter offensive is hailed as some ground breaking thing, while every major Russian advance is dismissed or given a ""at what cost narrative""). German papers not bad too. Asia based news papers are generally significantly better and i personally think Asia Times has the best coverage. India has some decent coverage too.

Outside of this, I find videos by Austrian colonel (Austria is an officially neutral country which is often left out when discussing the current issue - so they are less propagandistic) Markus Resiner to be extremely clear and pure matter of fact. He doesn't not sugar coat Russia or Ukraine and is very good.
Outstanding video here - https://youtu.be/RpC1kXhW2Lw

There's functional freedom and practical freedom. Anglo American media is broadly functionally propaganda that's even worse than Pravda or Chinese propaganda because at least Soviets and Chinese knew/know that it was/is propaganda. 

As for Anglo American media, they pretty much lie non stop. If after the American elections, you still take them seriously (they lied about Russian bounties, lied about the extent of the riots, lied about the entirety of Russiagate trying to convince Americans that their president was a Kremlin puppet, engaged in coordinated suppression of Hunter Biden's laptop which they also claimed was Russian - pure banana republic stuff ) I don't know what to tell you. They've also lied non stop about Ukraine, applying 0 critical thinking (the fake maternity ward bombing with no victims, ghost of Kiev, the fake snake island stuff, all the imagined counter offensives, the Russians bombing all the nuclear plants supposedly). And this is not even getting into Saddam's WMDs or ""moderate rebels"".

The most generous take is that they uncritically parrot ""anonymous intelligence"" agencies which essentially just make them government propaganda, laundered through ""trustworthy sources"", which makes the media a bunch of idiots. The less generous take....",ca4fd0c0b7e0226e5bdb63e1d59f4b76a8814a37,True,False,,,,,0,1654568861,,0,{},ibfxvd1,False,t3_v2is2u,False,True,t1_ibfdl38,/r/geopolitics/comments/v2is2u/ukraines_best_chance_for_peace_how_neutrality_can/ibfxvd1/,1654568875,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654540061.0,

Russia does shell a lot but there in cities where there are troops and fighting, which makes it legitimate - like when Israelis bomb the locations of Hamas even if they are in civilian centers).

Anecdotal evidence is meaningless and this article you share is anecdotal - there's a grand total of 3 testimonies. As far as evidence, we can see Donbass voted for autonomy (in a pro Russia direction) in 1994, which was promptly ignored by Ukraine. They overwhelmingly voted for yanukovych (70% i think), they were overwhelmingly anti Maidan, only 10% voted for poreshenko. Donbass was the site of the largest anti Maidan protests and strong handed Ukrainian response to these protests (mostly by the ultranationalist Nazis) led to separatists movement and civil war. Over the last 8 years, many have fled to Russia. 


And BTW, regarding them ""kidnapping"" men off the street - that is called drafting. Ukraine absolutely does the same thing. It was pretty well documented, especially by Indian media, that at the polish border, Ukraine snatched and stopped all men 18-40 from leaving. Do consider this kidnapping too? Drafts are pretty common in wars and most modern armies since Napoleon have won off the back of conscripts. 


Long term, it depends on how this settles and how Donbass is integrated into Russia (there is nearly 0 chance of Ukraine getting it back, let's be real). Russia's offensive may stall but the Ukrainian army is currently an army that is mostly defensive and fighting in bunkers - they are not going to become an offensive force in anything less than a year. If Russia is successful in integrating it and making it part of Russia and better than Ukraine (a very low bar as Ukraine is one of most corrupt countries on the planet, much more so than Russia). If it goes badly, then long term, it will be like Iraq, where they hate both the Americans and Iranians (in this case Russia and Ukraine) after the Americans destroyed their country, failed to create an alternative, and the Iranians unleashed a civil war via their funded militas.

Thus, we are a little ahead of Russia. Perhaps the same will happen to them once they see the body bags come back.

I respectfully disagree.

I don't think the issue of being ""civilized"". Fundamentally, American identity and U.S. interests are aligned in such a way as to make wars of conquest inconceivable: a critical mass of American citizens care about sovereignty and human rights, the most important U.S. allies care about sovereignty and human rights, the U.S. has no territorial disputes and, finally, its resource-rich landmass as well as its position as the architect and central node of the ""rules-based international order"" (really, the U.S.-centric ""West+"") makes territorial conquest useless to the U.S. anyway.

In the case of Russia, its identity and interests produce the opposite result: it has no tradition of rule of law, a critical mass of its (older) population - including its current power elite - remembers an era when Russia, under the guise of the USSR, was a superpower, and it has a territorial dispute with Ukraine - one that was caused by Russia back in 2014, although admittedly it already existed in a latent state prior to that time. Russia also lays outside the U.S.-led ""rules-based international order"", and Washington never made any effort to consider its self-perceived interest to have a sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.

At the end of the day, the U.S. could terminate its Iraqi and Afghan adventures at no real cost to itself. In the absolute, so could Russia with regards to Ukraine, of course, but at the cost of becoming just another meek European state lacking an independent foreign policy. It took the devastation of a World War as well as occupation to bring Germany and Japan to that point. It would be mistaken to assume the same can happen to Russia endogenously.",6a1b50ad069b22423ee6af8b57cd2f3f836b0c87,True,False,,,,,0,1654560224,,0,{},ibfgt0q,False,t3_v2ph7v,False,True,t1_iauqx43,/r/geopolitics/comments/v2ph7v/a_conversation_with_antony_blinken/ibfgt0q/,1654560236,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654531424.0,

I know Russia has made plenty of stupid moves in this war but getting a significant portion of their best troops and weaponry destroyed in a feint would top the cake. If they just wanted Donbas and a little bit more they could have put the vast majority of troops there to start.
