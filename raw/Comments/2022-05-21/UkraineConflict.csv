[],False,,blaziest,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qdtoh6u,False,False,"&gt;He fled to Russia and now lives in exile there , umm pretty obvious .

Does that make him ""russian-leaning""? 

Snowden lives in exile here too - does it mean he was russian leaning NSA agent?

Nonsense.

&gt;Don’t you follow the news, it was a big story that when offered safe passage by the US , Zalensky replied “I need ammunition not a ride”

That's irrelevant what he has said - he isn't just a politician - he is professional actor.

His patron in government, Bogdan, head of office, main functioneer described him as - ""[He lies constantly, but for him it's isn't lying, it is playing the role](https://youtu.be/QBZM_LBT0QM?t=862). His goal is to be popular to viewers - he comes out, says something, camera films that, job is done, people applauded, what happens next - doesn't matter.""

How do you think, you know situation better [than him](https://youtu.be/zqub3XbMcMk?t=111)? :)

&amp;#x200B;

His words are completely unworthy - from fresh, just yesterday he lied about evacuation of Azovstal fighter, when in reality they gave up. 

He lied about Minsk-2 peace treaty.

He lied to his nation about joining NATO, he has been told - ""we won't accept you in foreseeable future, but on public you have to say ""doors are opened"". Considering NATO claim was a key one for Russia - he, as a president (puppet or not - that's irrelevant), lied to his nation and brought war to his country refusing ""red line"" russian claim. 

List will be long if I continue. Very long.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very sure he personally has no control over situation. Just as he didn't have control in 2019 when he (as head commander) tried to disarm Azov guys, but even low rank commander told him to get the fuck out. Famous ""[I'm not a sucker, I'm president](https://youtu.be/nSPWH67hyNo?t=388)"" dialogue. 

Now you think he has control over USA/UK/NATO proxy war?

150K died in Tokyo from incendiary. So it was about showing off, but as a last resort instead of inflicting much higher casualties in an invasion. It was a world War dude. This is a backyard massacre but the ones being massacred aren't the ones you thought it would be. For a ""special military operation' it sure has killed anything but military.

Yes, there is more than the humanity aspect of war, especially considering all war is anti humanity. The need to dominate and the need to defend. The need for resources and territory, for strategic gain all of it.

However this gives me the ability to look at things unbiased. I can see the actions of US government and disagree. I can see the actions of Russia and disagree. I can also compare the two objectively.

You invaded your neighbor, twice, destroyed their cities raped their children and killed their people, while claiming it's a favor. Again, please point to the dead and raped Russians at the hands of Ukraine. Which cities have they destroyed. How many invasions of Russia by Ukraine? 

And I know the Russian military morale is shit because how could it not be, after the embarrassing display of force by Russia? If it was America taking that kind of beating, I would say the same thing. Even if your government wants to stick to the party line of minimal losses, the photos, maps, aerials reveal a graveyard of Russian gear and solders only dwarfed by the number of civilians killed.

This is to say nothing of your concentration camps. Or Syria or Chechnya.

The difference from America and Russia is this. When Americans attack, civilians get killed, we call it collateral damage. It sucks but it happens. Even on purpose sometimes, no boyscouts here.

For Russia though, killing civilians is doctrine. You don't respect life, and you never have. You never will.

But some things you have to understand is that even during Soviet times Moldovans were a minority in that area. It has always been a Russian/Ukrainian area. In fact during the war in the 90s all the Ukrainian Nationalist groups fought on the same side together with the Russian nationalist groups against the Moldovan military. And to this day Transnistria is mostly Russian/Ukrainian and all events in Ukraine aside, the Russians and Ukrainians that run that area have absolutely no incentive to change that status quo.

Besides, the reason NATO expanded, was the Russians, not the other way around. They wanted to come west, it wasnt about NATO going west. All of those countries including Ukraine, Georgia knew that this day would come. How many Ukrainian or Georgian invasions of Russia?

Ultraright in NATO and fools who listen anglophone propaganda aren't ""the world"". It's 1/7 of the world at max.

Noone sane cheers for people under swastika calling for murders.

&gt;Who the fuck are you to claim the moral highground?

I'm the one who doesn't cheer for nazis, unlike you.

&gt;You say they resort to terrorist tactics

Strategy. Not just tactics. Do you deny that?

&gt; what do you call the invasion ofUkraine

Special operation to change NATO-backed pro-nazi political course and stop LDNR war.

&gt;Where's azov filtration camps?

Whom are they supposed to filter?

&gt;Where's their war crimes?

Everywhere? Like - whole Mariupol is a result of their scorched earth tactics? All victims are the result of them blocking evacuation and using civilians as living shield?

Notice, how after they've lost last living shield in Azovstal (when after 2 months of ignoring situation UN and international red cross decided to save few hundred people out of 400k)  - these ""fearless walhalla warriors"" immediately gave up. 

Burnt districts, shot and shelled people, kids' heads blown by snipers (just a ""subhuman"" targets on their shooting range), POW murdered, civilians murdered and so on. 

&gt;Every society and nation has radicals in it. 

Does every society and nation promote them? Ultraright radicals, neonazis, white supremacists?

Azov is an official NATIONAL GUARDS unit. Similar Aidar is part of army. Tornado members were jailed (after money conflict with minister Avakov who covered them) - but after 24 of february they were released. Head prosecutor releases convicted war criminals - does your society works like that?

In your society on TV hosts call for genocide using Eichmann methods? Or biggest authorities call for genocide, for years? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have torch parades in glory of nazi collaborants? Do you have SS parade in your country, like Kiev had? Do you make kindergarteners glorify SS (Galicia, Nachitgal, Roland) members? Those who gave oath to Hitler.  

That's a state policy, part of a policy to create rusophobic political nation. Nobody hides that. That's not marginal group.

&gt;The world is much safer now, thank you.

Russia's future is safer, for sure. And for non-brainwashed ukranians on liberated territory it's safer aswell.

&gt;There are some Americans that are quite radical, racist, all kinds of things. They are still Americans.

Like Misanthropic division americans who fight in Ukraine? :)

Yeah, USA created a nazi hub in Ukraine. Typical USA - only negative impact on the world.

And USA keeps supporting neonazis even now! USA citizens seem to be very selfish, ignorant and greedy, and they choose not to notice how their government warmongers, promotes war and funds literal nazis (whom same government in previous years denied aid for being nazis, but now it's allowed).

&gt;And if you don't think the defense of Ukraine doesn't hold a chapter or two in military history, you're a little late. The world gave them two weeks, it's been three months. 

How to detect couch expert. 

(Oh, I've just read your nickname... )

&gt;If we are being honest, the only effective thing the true terrorists here have been able to do is shell and air strike. 

Your phrase reminds me of events in 2014, like [airstrike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDbl9C8Xg04) on Lugansk (LNR) city centre. I'm glad that you realize who are real terrorists, deliberately targetting civilians since 2014.

&gt;The only number people of killed greater than Russian soldiers is civilians. 

Keep watching CNN/BBC and believing ukranian fairytales. They were caught on lies (often absurd lies) hundreds times already - but you still believe them.

They openly admit being at info war. How did main Ukranian propagandist said - ""[It's just a limitless anti-russian war propaganda](https://www.worldandwe.com/files/imagecache/2048x1024/photo_20220321_213617.jpg)""?  

In Russia we call it - ""you can pee in their eyes - they'll still call it holy water"".

&gt;Pretty sure what's been done in the past three months dwarfs by Russia dwarfs any terrorist acts you accuse Azov of.

Absolutely not. Russia doesn't target civilians, doesn't target civilian infrastructure. Absolute majority of ukranians have water,electricity, food, even RUSSIAN gas almost 3 months into conflict. 

Don't make me laugh - look how Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Genichesk, Energodar lives... And compare that to Mariupol under Azov commandment aka ""organizing destruction and genocide"".

&gt;They are not the threat, not by a long shot. 

Ukranian state political course is a threat - and nazis is just one of projections of this course.

&gt;Leave the moral highground for those with clean hands.

For NATO? :)

For USA who organized this war? 

I doubt you country has experienced horrors of nazism, that's why you don't understand that such regimes have to be destroyed. 

You are the opposite - you have no idea what you talk about (ukranian situation) and sympathize them. ""Useful idiot"" is the name of such approach.

&gt;Why don't you leave it up to a tribunal at the Hague

Why would you expect Hague court suddenly to have reputation? They are politicized and that was shown in many cases. Just remember Yugoslavia and name me a single non-serb who got life-sentence?

Cmon, international community was glorifying Kosovo president, who was personally responsible for trading organs on black market.

Dear Russian friends, I never thought that I would write about politics or, in general, about anything less than the Universal Consciousness. But Life decided otherwise.    
I am Ukrainian, and I want to emphasize right away that I do not hate everything Russian. I do not hate the Russian people. I will not thoughtlessly smear everything Russian. I will still be polite to anyone, regardless of their passport. I don't care if you are Russian or not. But you should know that I stand for the complete destruction of the Putin system. If you still support Putin despite all his atrocities in Ukraine, you'd better unsubscribe from me. This is my position.  
That Putin's system is a rotten outgrowth on the body of the world is already clear to anyone with a little more intelligence than a moonshine machine. This rot is dangerous for everyone, it is capable of infecting and killing the entire earth. It no longer matters whether you are a Russian or not. Now is not the time for patriotism.   
Every thinking person should have been finally convinced during this war that Putin and his entourage with their actions, in fact, are gradually returning Russia to the 80-90s of the 20th century. After all, it is clear that the consequences of this war will arouse for all Russians for decades. And every thinking person, of course, knows that he is being fed brazen lies at the state level, in the news, so why does not it cause an immediate response, a rebuff, in his heart? Isn't he disgusted that his own government despises him so much that it allows outright nonsense to be poured on his ears? Of course it disgusts him. But he is forced to keep quiet.   
I have no hatred for intelligent and educated Russians, because I know that they are simply afraid to speak openly against Putin. I lived in Russia for 7 years and I know very well what happens there, it's a real police state. And almost all my friends from Russia (editors, journalists, artists, designers, philosophers, poets, writers) already in 2005 were talking about Putin as a fascist. But 15 years in prison for simply calling the war a war is something none of the intelligentsia can handle. After all, it would also be a Russian prison... They have to shut up and keep quiet, regardless of their position.    
And I have no hatred for another category of Russians - the uneducated and stupid. Simply because they are incapable of distinguishing truth from propaganda, for too many years they have been fed disinformation. But if such a person picks up a weapon, he immediately turns into a war criminal, and it is them that I strongly dislike. Russian soldiers who rape children and kill civilians just for fun should be court-martialed along with Putin's state machine. I think any developed Russian person should hate them for these crimes as much as I do, regardless of their passport or roots.    
I have no desire to argue or prove anything to anyone. Life is the only thing that interests me in this world. Not my own, but Life in general. When innocent children are dying next to me, I cannot stand by and remain silent. Right now, life on Earth is in danger because of the actions of one man who, before he died of cancer, decided to make a loud ""boom,"" probably to be remembered better.   
Many countries have already united against Putin, thank you all very much for that! I sometimes cry for joy when I read how the whole world has rallied to help us. (A special thank you to USA, UK and Poland - you are very good, my dears, thanks to you I still believe in humanity.)      
But if you are Russian and live in Russia - you too can find a way to confront evil from within. We must all say our firm universal ""NO"" to it. Regardless of our roots and origins.    
This is precisely the moment when intellectuals, young and not so young, must step in. Remember that only you, the minds of Russia, can overthrow the dictator and tyrant who has restricted your freedoms for so long. After all, you must already be well aware of the deep abyss into which your president has led you and continues to lead you. Remember, no one else will do it but you. Simply because the rest of the Russians really don't know or don't want to know the true state of affairs. It's time for the intelligentsia to become courageous. It's time for intellectuals to fight back against the lies and obscurantism of a dictator who seems to have lost all common sense.",113646436d25eac7c566fa3001182742121025f1,True,False,,,,,0,1653141794,,0,{},i9g8fxy,True,t3_uunrmj,False,False,t3_uunrmj,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uunrmj/i_read_a_very_touching_antiputin_letter_from_a/i9g8fxy/,1653141806,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653112994.0,

US Secretary of State Blinken accuses Russia of using food as a weapon in Ukraine


By Ishika Dangayach on May 20, 2022 | 08:23 PM IST

Russian forces have taken hostage the food supply for millions of Ukrainians and others throughout the world
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday accused Russia at the United Nations Security Council of using food as a weapon in Ukraine.

“The Russian Government seems to believe that using food as a weapon will help accomplish what its invasion has not: to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people,” Blinken said in a meeting.

The Russian military has essentially taken hostage the food supply for millions of Ukrainians and others throughout the world, Blinken further accuses.

Together, Russia and Ukraine produce about a third of the world's wheat. Ukraine is a major exporter of grain, barley, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil, among other commodities.

“The decision to weaponize food is Moscow’s and Moscow’s alone,"" Blinken said.

US Secretary of State said as a result of the Russian Government’s actions, some 20 million tons of grain sit unused in Ukrainian silos as global food supplies dwindle, and prices skyrocket, causing more around the world to experience food insecurity.",e9dcd3d7fa328a7e184369dd92b51193ac4af5ef,True,False,,,,,0,1653141197,,0,{},i9g79jb,False,t3_uubeum,False,True,t1_i9e7i37,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uubeum/russian_forces_have_taken_hostage_the_food_supply/i9g79jb/,1653141208,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653112397.0,

Still insisting on giving your personal opinions about me, spare me, I couldn't care less what an idiot like you say or think about me:-)

""The links you send me now don't change that at all.'

Hey, dimwit, what part of 'I don't care what an arrogant prig like you think or say' you don't understand? Of 'I dont' post the links to your pathological megalomanic personality but for those who might be reading so they get a chance of alternative views'?

Certainly, it's no surprise for one who is a blatant hegemonic psycho to think everybody else's opinions are  biased or invalid but his:-), your obvious case.

'Your links are useful to convince people that the Red Cross has its limitations and, like any large organization of age, has plenty of other issues. But that's obvious and I don't need any convincing of that.'

Ok, self-centered moron, your incapacity to recognize YOUR mistakes just make you more insufferable, you start to look more like a really toxic person than just a silly, needy childish guy desperate for attention. 

You're really harmful to those who can't see your pathological tendencies and you'll certainly spread more brainwashing but I've realized those who might prefer to give you credit are lost cases themselves, so I can only post the links and let them choose which perspective they'll adopt or neither, taking their own conclusions, whereas you will go on in your 'mission' to make them 'see the truth' your megalomania has established for them:-) Oh, it do sound very much like Putnists, LOL

'If this central premise of 'siding with russia' were true (and substantiated by such public statements as mentioned in the article), it would mean that the ICRC would completely abandon its core 'brand' and mission, for no apparent gain. This organization can only function if it is perceived as neutral, and as such it can't speak out against the parties it needs to work with (like the author seems to expect).'

This is such a platitude it sounds more like a propaganda by the Red Cross itself! Ludicrous, as if this could change the plethora of  data and arguments those lucid articles written by true experts put forward.

'If this central premise of 'siding with russia' were true (and substantiated by such public statements as mentioned in the article), it would mean that the ICRC would completely abandon its core 'brand' and mission, for no apparent gain. This organization can only function if it is perceived as neutral, and as such it can't speak out against the parties it needs to work with (like the author seems to expect).'

As if the Red Cross background history showing its serious compliance with the Nazis in their concentration camps in WWII were not enough  to raise understandable suspicion about that organization, especially when Ukrainian activists and authorities have denounced it themselves:-)

Again, moron, not for you but for those who might be reading this and would like to know the facts, not your arrogant blunders:

The (opinion) article you linked to has extremely limited 'evidence' for its central claim that 'The International Red Cross is siding with Russia'. The links you send me now don't change that at all. 

Your links are useful to convince people that the Red Cross has its limitations and, like any large organization of age, has plenty of other issues. But that's obvious and I don't need any convincing of that.

If this central premise of 'siding with russia' were true (and substantiated by such public statements as mentioned in the article), it would mean that the ICRC would completely abandon its core 'brand' and mission, for no apparent gain. This organization can only function if it is perceived as neutral, and as such it can't speak out against the parties it needs to work with (like the author seems to expect).  

Understanding this context, the claim that the Red Cross abandoned their neutrality in favour of russia, is so extraordinary that it would need some very strong evidence.

The Romans were absolute masters of war because they incorporated all the different military strategies they came up against and overcame.
