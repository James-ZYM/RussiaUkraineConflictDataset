**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces are conducting operations to cut off Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk across the Severskyi Donetsk River.  
The information space in Mariupol will likely become increasingly restricted in the coming weeks as Russian forces shift focus from completing the capture of the Azovstal Steel Plant to consolidating occupational control of the city.  
Russian troops are likely reinforcing their grouping around Kharkiv City to prevent further Ukrainian advances toward the international border.  
Russian forces may be assembling forces in certain areas of Zaporizhia and Kherson oblasts to initiate further offensive operations on the southern axis.  


**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. Russan forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to northern Kharkiv in the near future.   
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.  
Russian forces in Mariupol will likely shift their focus to occupational control of the city as the siege of Azovstal has concluded.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in southern Ukraine.",196fad819cf7c1383710465a0d31f9c852496f07,True,False,,,,,0,1653172643,,0,{},i9i0mz5,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t3_uuln25,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9i0mz5/,1653172658,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653143843.0,

They can't get stuff from China because China isn't selling stuff to them that can cause Chinese companies to be sanctioned by the west for breaking the embargo. It's not just that the west is not doing business with Russia, it's that the west isn't doing business with anyone doing business with Russia. Google Huawei, Union Pay, tech and banking giants withdrawing from Russian business because they don't want to even risk losing business in the west. This is easy to Google. They're not providing anything sanction breaking to Russia. No tech, no military stuff, no oil industry machinery. Same goes for the rest of the world. It's been 3 months already. We can see the state of Russian imports and that they collapsed. 

Russia is a large food exporter, but wiling whatever is oversinpifying a lot of thibgs. You can be an animal feed exporter but a net food importer. You can export fertiliser and import seeds. That's what globalised trade means. Russia isn't self reliant. They import a lot of the seed stock for agriculture. Economies specialise, and Russia specialised in all the wrong stuff to be self reliant. They extract oil and gas using foreign machinery, run an industry using foreign automation software and electronics and export food grown from imported seeds. 

Russian oil profits are higher because their imports collapsed. You can sell your TV, and shoes and furniture and make a profit. You're still more worse off than before because you have cash you can't spend and you're sleeping on the floor. Russia is selling oil for $ it doesn't buy anything with. But at least it has high profits. 

Europe cannot quit Russia. Until the moment they do. So far the imports are going down. Once new contracts are signed and new infrastructure is in place it will be used. And once Europe is geared for receiving hydrocarbons by sea, they won't return to the Russian pipelines. 

China is not buying up all Russian oil. Not by far, and what they're buying is at a huge discount. These are numbers easy to find. Winking is sprinkling a few true sources that are not relevant to the topic at hand and a shit load of conjecture and speculation. His strongest statements are completely outsourced. Never addresses lack of imports and Russia and the importance of this fact, just the truism that if you sell your house and never spend the money you make a profit and sleep under a bridge. Never addresses the fact that nobody from the 3/4 of the world that didn't officially apply sanctions on Russia, they're also not selling them any meaningful tech or even consumer products.

They literally offered them a better economic deal than the EU in 2013.  Which is why the 2014 coup happened when the Ukrainian president decided better relations with Russia were more economically helpful to Ukraine.  

&gt;The agreement could also fuel protests in Kiev against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, who faces accusations of “selling” Ukraine to the highest bidder after spurning a trade deal with the European Union and turning to Moscow for help.

That was written in 2013 and unsurprisingly the 'color revolution' then overthrew the goverment...with western backing:

The group operated out of a training base near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The U.S. invested about $126 million in efforts related to the training, Hilbert said.

The Russians published classified Ukrainian documents that the AFU was going to invade the Donbass in March 2022, which is what triggered the Russian invasion:

Whether Popansa was technically a breakthrough or not is debatable. The Russians were able to take it and then move in numerous different directions with some success before they were finally stopped by counterattacks or new hasty positions. But they were stopped and failed to exploit it.  

Pursuit and exploitation are terms that generally refer to actions done after the breakthrough has been achieved, like getting into the enemy's tactical rear area, rampaging around in tanks and IFV shooting up division's artillery artillery park, overrunning units on the march, ambushing various support units, conducting tactical encirclements, etc. It can also mean keeping pressure on the enemy as they retreat. 

At the operational level pursuit and exploitation mean things like overrunning supply depots, large combat field hospitals, corps level headquarters and associated communication nodes, taking key lines of communication (cities that are intersections to make road and rail lines), as well as deep and largely uncontested drives into the interior heading towards strategic objectives (which is what the Russians focus on as an operational objective, deep operations).  

Breakout is an informal term used mostly by Americans and tends to relate to a breakthrough done at the operational level, whereas breakthrough is at the tactical level. So you might breakthrough through a town or specific location, but you breakout of a region you might have been stuck in and into another. In WW2, Allied forces broke out of the distinct terrain of the Normandy area and into the open country of central France. In this war, if the Russians were stronger than they currently are, had they managed to rupture the lines in the Severodonetsk salient and achieve a tactical breakthrough it could have been possible to exploit it and possibly even end up taking Dnipro.",6bfadd4f0c6de70517f93b967eb7b0ed41ac7d05,True,False,,,,,0,1653164438,,0,{},i9hkk87,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t1_i9h6plr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9hkk87/,1653164450,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653135638.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"The Severodonetsk salient's northern shoulder close to Izyum and that was where the main north-south highway that led to the closest point of the southern shoulder that made sense as the points to reduce the salient, which should always be done at the shoulders, because then flattens out the line afterwards (and reduces your own frontage, allowing more units to be pulled into the reserve for things like reconstitution), while also destroying the majority of the enemy inside of the salient (they too have to man the lines on the long line caused by the acute angle of the salient). 

As an operation plan, this offensive seemed to use the drive Izyum as the northern pincer while the Popansa was the southern. However, too much resistance around Izyum, especially south and SE where they needed to go,  meant having to move the northern pincer axis further east, to Lyman, and then east again, where the river crossings done in the last two weeks have occurred, with last week's failing and this week's having limited success, maybe (who knows?). 

The southern pincer axis from Popansa has been going on since before this offensive was announced to have finally started and only recently ""took"" the city (it was utterly destroyed, forcing the Ukrainians finally to pull back to their next defensive line), that being considered the first breakthrough (though not a breakout), and then in the last couple days having done breakthroughs to the north, west, and south from Popansa, with one of this axis being the one threatening to cut one of the two main supply routes leading to the deepest portion the salient, where Severodonetsk and Lysychansk are located. 

When it comes to those locations, they have also been under attack since the beginning of this battle. Operationally it doesn't make sense to have been attempting a frontal assault with the intent to achieve a breakthrough there (its the wrong spot to attack to destroy a salient, those are supposed to be done with flank attacks), so I think it was a supporting attack, specifically a holding attack designed to be strong enough to threaten the UA, force them to commit more resources there, definitely strong enough they cannot strip the line for reserves to send other places in the salient, while also being credible enough of a threat that its possible they might take ground and potentially even achieve their own breakthrough. 

That's happened before. For instance, during the ground campaign in Operation Desert Storm the US Marine Corps forces had a corps sized element and was tasked with conducting a frontal holding attack against the Iraqis holding the Saudi-Kuwait border to fix them in place while VII and XVIII corps flanked the Iraqis with a left hook to the Kuwaiti western border and directly into Iraq itself. I think we might be seeing something like that in the Severodonetsk/Lysychansk operations, where they are doing credible frontal assaults but managing to achieve gains because the UA thinned their lines already. But they avchieved enough success that the UA had to either leave forces there or maybe even reinforce them. And the more there the more aren't defending Izyum or Lyman, or Popansa. And the more there then the more than are in the bag if they can cut the salient. 

I saw someone post a map of the Donbas area with axis of advance arrows showing where the various encirclements were planned out with dates. I wish I could find that now, but it does well to showcase what has been happening. Up from the time this offensive has been conceived and executed and since as alterations/modifications have been made to it, the encirclements have gotten smaller and smaller. Now the only thing really threatened are those forces deep in the Severodonetsk/Lysychansk salient, everyone else should be fine as long as they can hold the line and don't panic and rout. 

There are no great operational achievements from bagging the deepest parts of the Severodonetsk/Lysychansk salient unless they can destroy large amounts of UA forces, because then they can't be used in the future. Strategically they gain Luhansk and more of Donetsk oblasts, and a good piece of defensive terrain (the same river lines they are having trouble moving past) to hold against UA counteroffensives. 

But if you balance that out with what this cost them in terms of manpower and equipment losses that they have no planned ability to replace, at best this is a limited operational and strategic victory that is very Pyrrhic in nature.",932c2da7c405aaa9243dbbeb75380c60ef5df48e,True,False,,,,,0,1653163445,,0,{},i9hik0y,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t1_i9go2ju,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9hik0y/,1653163460,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653134645.0,

Unless Israel uses its F35's it's likely that they will lose some non-zero number of aircraft during any operation, and in every scenario a lot of Russian officers will die, which would have huge repercussions.",8623440bd5c6ec101bbfd9ad57b5b2d957ccdb51,True,False,,,,,0,1653162045,,0,{},i9hfqf0,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t1_i9he3hs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9hfqf0/,1653162057,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653133245.0,

The Trump Administration authorized more funding and sales/transfer of weapon systems to Ukraine than Obama (Javelin). During his administration the US military advisory mission, JMTG-U, expanded, as did [US funding](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56a146abb204d5878d6f125a/cffd7277-6122-4b25-a6a3-40c20f4b0b44/Annual+US+military+aid+to+Ukraine.png?format=1000w). Trump fucked up so many things you can blame him for near everything you want and make a credible argument. This isn't one of them. What you wrote about regarding Ukraine is a paper thin talking point, the DC standard, with future POTUS blaming their predecessor for their own fuckups.   
  
Furthermore, last I checked Trump left office in January 2021, thirteen months before this war started. Suggesting that Biden didn't have time to move a few battalions already forward deployed in the Baltics and Poland to conduct a show of force in Ukraine, despite US military troops already there in multiple brigsde strength, is flat out wrong. That takes a week or so. We could have had full companies of US Army or Marines, armed to the teeth, near Ukraine cities on the exact invasion routes, could have done this at any time since the Russian buildup started, especially after December 2021 when someone handed us the actual invasion routes as an intel gift.   
  
Biden was NOT in a no-win situation, that's just bullshit. The US helped start this war and then ran away from it right before it started. All a series of deliberate decisions that I have no doubt numerous members of his own cabinet and staff probably warned him not to do, undeterred like Afghanistan too.   
  
The US support for Ukraine helped trigger the 2014 revolution (which I support too). It pushed for openly arming and training Ukraine to counter Russia (which I also support). It pushed for Ukraine to join NATO (which I also support). It gave them top notch weapon systems, comms, and shared intel for years (which I also support). We weren't just involved in the series of events that led up to this war, we had our fingers all up inside of everything. We were playing puppeteer again but then bailed out when the threat of war became serious, and only came back in after it started. It shouldn't even have started and most likely wouldn't have if Biden hadn't openly told Putin, Russia, and the whole world  the following, upon finding out and then giving Ukraine its first invasion warnings in December 2021: 

[BBC: Russia Ukraine: Sending US troops not on table - Biden](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59582013)

That's just fucking stupid 

Even if Biden didn't want to go to war, even if he was covertly acknowledging to his cabinet and staff that there was no way in hell he was getting involved, there was NO REASON IN HELL TO TELL PUTIN THAT. 

If you don't understand that, you're the guy who loses every hand of poker but can't explain why. You're the one who loses every argument you get into and can't understand why. You're the go who doesn't understand politics, diplomacy and warfare either. 

By making that public declaration he removed a massive hurdle for Putin to start this war, who had to be worrying whether or not the US would get involved. 

We know now that this ""special military operation"" was launched on the cheap with orders to be done and finished quickly because they didn't expect resistance (to include from the US) and they wanted it done quickly as a fait accompli before reparations were even possible, which they though they could weather. Why did Putin think they'd only get light sanctions? Why did Putin think this war wouldn't be a war? What might have given him the idea not to take it seriously? 

Maybe POTUS telling him that the US was abandoning Ukraine to its fate, which was his redeeming message from December until the war started. 

Hell, let's look at comments Biden made about US govt's willingness and obligation to conduct Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) in Ukraine to rescue American citizens in danger, a duty of our govt: 

[NPR: Biden tells U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine, saying military wouldn't rescue them](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/11/1080060546/biden-us-citizens-leave-ukraine) 

Did Biden have no choice but to elaborate to Lester Holt that he wont risk nuclear war to save US citizens? Did he really need to tell the world that? Had the State Dept issued a very strong alert, that wouldn't have been enough? Instead Biden has to openly state in an interview that he wont risk war over Ukraine, even over dead Americans? 

And then what about the limited number of US troops already in Ukraine in an advisory capacity, the ones nowhere near the invasion areas? 

[CBS: Pentagon orders departure of U.S. troops in Ukraine as Russia crisis escalates](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/pentagon-orders-departure-of-us-troops-in-ukraine.html)

Now imagine you're Putin and wondering about American resolve under Biden. Are you seriously going to suggest this didn't play a factor into Putin making the decision to invade and launch his ""special military operation"" (not a war), especially thinking the US wouldn't respond afterwards with harsh sanctions he didn't think Biden would do? I wonder what went through Putin's head to think that Biden would be soft on Ukraine? 

Whatever in the world could have given him that idea?  

Even Vindman, who was the one who turned in Trump regarding the Ukraine-Javelin Quid Pro Quo allegation, said Biden fucked up:

I'm referring to the first use of S-300 in Syria by Russian officers against the Israeli Air Force.

I see this as very significant for a few reasons:

- First and only open military action against a western country by Russia since the war began
- Israel is not part of NATO and there's no scenario where Israel joins NATO. So it's a great place for Russia to show teeth without risking global nuclear war
- It opens the door for Russia to cause chaos and potentially create cracks in the western alliance (as Saddam intended to when it devoted precious missiles to hitting Tel Aviv *while his country was being invaded*, in order to bait Israel into overreacting). Shooting a foreign jet in foreign territory can be spun for political and diplomatic gain.
- Russia beginning to shoot down Israeli F15's left and right while inside of Syria would have huge repercussions for the war in Ukraine. There's little chance of Russia actually going to war with Israel, nor Israel with Russia, but this would significantly affect the diplomatic relations between Russia and the world (maybe some Arab states become friendlier?

Personally, I think we should be figuring out how to salami slice Russia and working toward a long term goal of simply dismantling it into several smaller independent nation states.  Talk a lot about the power vacuum that will be open to some folks when Putin is pushed out.  Talk about some of the ""autonomous"" republics within the RF as potential breakaway republics having an opportunity now that the RF military is being devastated elsewhere.  Talk about how some of those potential breakaway regions wouldn't be subject to sanctions against Russia if they were independent.  Maybe encourage Japan to be more aggressive about their territorial dispute with Russia.

Not really anything they can't get from China or the 3/4ths of the world not sanctioning them.  The west ain't the only game in town anymore.

&gt;Oil and gas price has increased but Russia needs to sell at a discount to India and China. Their capacity to ship there is limited because they rely on pipelines for most export, pipelines to Europe. As European consumption goes down this cash influx will dry up as well.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/russia-doubles-fossil-fuel-revenues-since-invasion-of-ukraine-began

Yet Russian profits are double what they were before the sanctions.  Europe cannot quit Russia, they just are lying about their ability to sanction.  It's all for show.

&gt;So that's crap for any remaining Russian exports, coupled with their inability to buy anything with the strong ruble because nobody is selling them stuff. Taken in isolation a strong currency sounds good, but if it's limited in what you can buy with it ...

Yet Russia is at all time trade surpluses:
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/05/13/russia-is-on-track-for-a-record-trade-surplus

Doesn't seem to be a problem, especially when they give discounts to their allies like India and China, while make the west that still needs their stuff pay the inflated prices.  Win-win-win for Russia, shit the bed for the west.  

&gt;Stopping oil imports. The vast majority of cash influx to Russia comes from selling oil, not gas. Oil is much more expensive. Also the primary export artery is by pipeline to Europe and that can be closed much sooner than for gas.

We must not forget what a win looks like, before February 24th most people assumed the initial invasion was going to be a done deal, similar or even faster than US invasion of Iraq, but that Russia will struggle to hold the country in the post-war occupation. Now we see them struggling harder with the initial phase, even if US withdraws support tomorrow and Zelensky declares a total surrender, Russia is never going to succeed in the occupation.

We saw how much even the hyper-competent US military struggled against a bunch of destitute guys in their pickup trucks, occupation of Ukraine would be much much worse. Hundreds of thousands of partisans would be constantly preying on the isolated Russian units (something which Russia is uniquely adept in managing to do), the money from the very large Ukrainian diaspora will never stop flooding in and Russian heavy-handed approach to dealing with dissent is only going to create more partisans every day. And Russia has none of the resources to deal with such a quagmire, even if all the sanctions were removed tomorrow and the world turned a blind eye towards their actions.

Because all the security concerns arose with the collapse of the USSR and NATO's aggressive expansion East.  Modern Russia didn't start that, the old resentments of the former Soviet republics against Russia did coupled with the US aggressively pushing for NATO expansion against Russia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfowitz_Doctrine

In 1992 when Russia was a basketcase the US formulated the doctrine to keep Russia forever crippled and NATO expansion was one plank in that policy.  Post-USSR's aggressive stance has been in reaction to US/NATO threats to it rather than Eastern Europe fighting Russian aggression.  You have causality backwards.

The CIA by the way has been the one behind all these so-called Color Revolutions:

I truly believe if we gave everything we have up to this point before the invasion that they would have crushed the Russians, imagine the convoy outside Kyiv being pounded with artillery, more baryaktars, switchblades etc and a counter attack with polish tanks etc etc

The issue is also the Russians wanting to hold onto Ukrainian territory. The whole point of these fake republics is they are basically modern land imperialistic land grabs that are done with deniability.

The entire existence of the fake donbass republics enabled the invasion. It allowed putins procdural bullshit of “ oh were recognising them” “now we’re peacekeeping” ( formalising greater troop presence) “wooops just doing a quick operation now”

Western intelligence, others like Phillip karber long advised the US about how many echelons of Russian paratroopers, spetsnaz, regular army units and Wagner and security services personnel were in Ukraine for years.

I really feel we should call all of these military adventures “Russian Annexed Areas of Desired Deniability”. Because putin long killed givi, zakharchenko, Motorola etc with thermobaric bombs planted near them.

The entire businesses was run top down directly by Moscow.


It’s given them a buffer to make war  on Ukraine while being able to be destructive and not risking their own territory. If  Ukraine can push the Russians out and then start  fortifyi by their border like they did in the donbass it makes them more defensible.

Because Russians were shelling Ukrainians across the border with impunity for years.

They also did the same playbook as so thy Georgia, in the lead up to the war start heavy shelling and using thermobarixs and trying to escalate hoping that the Ukrainians would take the bait like sakishvilli did. But they didn’t so Russia had to invade unprovoked as also even their false flags were called out.

If Ukraine doesn’t manage to push the Russians out of donbass it greatly affects their future prospects.

They will just try rebuild their forces and then pull the same BS.

Even if they’ve depleted most of the males in donbass they’ll send their soldiers in and claim they’re immigrants or something.

When they want to make war they’ll just start shelling again and playing the lying game that Ukrainians started it.

As long as Russians control Ukrainian territory I will certainly be used as a staging ground for covert operations and any putinist government or hawk like government will use the territory as a buffer for any hybrid war and eventual full scale military campaign.

It’s just my opinion but I’ve wondered so much about this.

I wonder even if putin is gone will the Russian government ever stop plotting against Ukraine, trying to destabilise it or running a hybrid war when it suits them.",0dc0b7af55bb981692d366473cdec69ed4f30218,True,False,,,,,0,1653157145,,0,{},i9h5mt9,False,t3_utth7l,False,True,t1_i9g4c39,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utth7l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_20_2022/i9h5mt9/,1653157156,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653128345.0,

&gt; India is the world’s largest buyer of Russian weapons, although it has scaled back that relationship of late. Over the past decade, India has bought more than $4 billion worth of military equipment from the US and more than $25 billion from Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which collects data on arms transfers.

&gt; India’s dependence on Russia for weapons against neighbors China and Pakistan is a big reason Modi’s government has avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. As the US, Europe, Australia and Japan piled economic sanctions on Russia, India has held off and instead continued imports of discounted Russian oil. ",e6f5f2e49c18ce0216fcaa33350f653006622ef0,True,False,,,,,0,1653153167,,0,{},i9gx0j1,False,t3_uuqvuj,False,True,t1_i9gwyt5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuqvuj/helping_india_replace_russia_in_the_value_arms/i9gx0j1/,1653153182,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653124367.0,

-------------------

&gt; * The United States dominates the high-end arms market, and as a result the high-end arms market dominates American discussions of weapons sales. But while American analysts focus on fifth generation front-line fighters and billion-dollar transactions, there is a second market for buyers looking for a better deal. This “value market” encompasses at least 112 countries with annual defense budgets of less than three 24-plane squadrons of new F/A-18s.

&gt; * Russia has always been a major player in this market, providing older-vintage or refurbished equipment to states that have often been neglected by Washington. But as a result of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia will increasingly struggle to meet the value market’s needs. This provides an opportunity for Washington to work with New Delhi to make sure that Russia’s role is filled by India, rather than by China.
 
&gt; * Currently, India’s defense export sector is tiny. India was the 23rd-largest arms exporter between 2011 and 2017 and exports in 2021 only totaled $1.13 billion. But U.S.-Indian collaboration can help the Indian industrial complex to produce weapons that India will use, and that value market customers will purchase.

&gt; * Washington will still be selling the world’s prestige weapons systems. It should work with India to make sure that the rest of the world is buying its armored vehicles, small arms, and helicopters from a friendly nation instead of an adversary.

&gt; * Russia is the second-largest global arms exporter. It has averaged $13-15 billion in annual sales since 2000 and accounts for 20 percent of all international sales since 2016. 

&gt; * In Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, Russian defense equipment extends Russian political influence. Russia’s potential inability to satisfy international contracts because of Russo-Ukrainian War-related equipment losses, the U.S.-led sanctions regime, and domestic political inefficiencies, prompts a question: Who fills the void?

&gt; * …France also exports high-end equipment to China like the AS565S military helicopter, as well as helicopter engines, avionics, radars, and frigate engines….

&gt; * Currently, India lacks the financial and manufacturing capacity to kickstart its indigenous defense manufacturing.

&gt; * For example, defective ammunition identified in 2010 remained in storage until it exploded in 2016, killing 19 soldiers and injuring 17 others.

&gt; * These quality control problems are exacerbated by a cozy relationship between public firms and the Directorate General of Quality Assurance. Much as Boeing’s relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration has led to questions about oversight quality, India faces problems with the regulatory structure of public-sector defense manufacturing.

&gt; * …Washington should help move legacy production lines from the U.S. to India.

&gt; * The Ladakh clash in 2020 spurred India’s domestic pursuit of a 25-ton or lighter tank to counter China’s Type 15. Currently, India faces a minimum 5-year development and production lag. General Dynamics Land Systems and BAE Systems are competing for the U.S. Army light tank contract. Hypothetically, the U.S. winner could supply their vehicles to India without export-controlled subsystems.

There's perhaps the most important variable in this war. If the propaganda can't get the Russian people to get on board with risking their lives over this, then they've lost the war. That's why it is so important that Ukraine NOT attack and kill civilians within Russia. Any missiles sent into Russia must be very specifically target precise. Putin can still mobilize the reserves, but if he does the death numbers must trickle, not flow like a deluge. And how does he orchestrate that? Not so easy if he wants to advance on more Ukrainian territory. That's probably right there why they have slowed their advance being much more careful. So it appears to me, that unless Russia can take more territory with the soldiers they have, they are done. And that's why, imo, Ukraine has to keep the death numbers climbing as fast as possible for Russia, and have what they need for a counter-offensive. Yeah, taking out Russian equipment is important, but unfortunately for human lives lost, I see focusing on taking out troops as almost more important. Got to make those numbers hurt Russia because I believe Russia can always fix their own tanks and get them ready for battle and make more tanks with all the oil they're selling.

Dude seemed crazy brainwashed. He actually praises the deliberate killing of their own guys, he claims that “they’d have been tortured by the banderas” so it was right to kill them with an Atgm.. several of their guys being led away by Ukrainians were deliberately blown up all together.

The most interesting thing other than him believing Ukraine would put nukes in Kharkiv on behest of the USA or other stupid shit..

He says the typical enslaved Russian statement “some Ukrainians are good people **far away from politics**”

I heard the same thing when a Russian POWs mother was on the phone with the interviewer she pled crying “ we are good people **we are far from politics**”

Amidst the brainwashing of Russians and Russian soldiers that Ukrainians are nazis for defending themselves and not wanting to be subjugated in some union state with Belarus and Russia on top..

Russians also have their brainwashed mentality that it is only virtuous to be non politically involved as a result of the warped “social contract” with Putin.

So someone who dares think that an election shouldn’t be rigged or dares think they don’t want to live their whole lives under putin is a bad person.

It’s strange how the Russian soldier also projects this onto Ukrainians. They really can’t see them as separate from Russians.

He sees any Ukrainians that wish to have their own representation and to have rights, ability to vote, ability to have a free society and not be subordinated to putins will as therefore being “involved in politics” even if it’s their own country!

It’s extremely strange.

I even heard it a third time. A Russian mother mourning her son who died recently in Ukraine fighting putins war paused and said “ look **im far from politics** but I am very concerned with all the young boys dying” when interviewed.

It’s totally imprinted in their minds not to resist the will of the putinist government so people that were hoping Russians would immediately somehow stop  the war were very delusional. The most they do is stick their head in the sand or repeat propaganda with the paranoia that they may face issues if they seem lacking in compliance.

The most you get when things get difficult is these admissions that “they are far from politics” before giving minor criticism.

Oil and gas price has increased but Russia needs to sell at a discount to India and China. Their capacity to ship there is limited because they rely on pipelines for most export, pipelines to Europe. As European consumption goes down this cash influx will dry up as well.

&gt;  Russia is at record trade surpluses

That's easy to do when you don't buy anything. No imports of food, consumer goods, no raw materials for the industry (Russia can't extract everything locally), no parts or service maintenance for equipment in the country (Arctic and Siberian extraction needs western tech that is now off limits), no seeds for agriculture (they've been importing that heavily) and no new parts for the military. They even ran out of airbags for making cars and chips for bank cards. Sure the trade surplus is big, but if you can't spend it on anything what's it good for? For now they're only paying foreign debt with it because that's the only transfer of $ allowed. 

&gt;the Ruble is stronger than it has been since any point after 2014 when the original sanctions began

So that's crap for any remaining Russian exports, coupled with their inability to buy anything with the strong ruble because nobody is selling them stuff. Taken in isolation a strong currency sounds good, but if it's limited in what you can buy with it ...

&gt; There are no more sanctions cards to play and the ones that have been played only help Russia.

Stopping oil imports. The vast majority of cash influx to Russia comes from selling oil, not gas. Oil is much more expensive. Also the primary export artery is by pipeline to Europe and that can be closed much sooner than for gas.

As to the war overall that is a VERY big topic.  War in general is utterly awful, so I'll never say anyone is right to start one, but I understand why Putin did.  Contrary to what NATO propaganda is around this war there were good reasons for him to do so from a security perspective, but this is a great power conflict, so everyone involved sucks.  Ukraine being deserving of anything is injecting morality in a place where it doesn't belong.  This is about great power priorities, so the powers that be have determined supplying them is the way to go.  I think in Ukraine's interests it is better than they lose as quickly as possible to avoid further destruction and death, because even assuming victory were possible (it isn't) the cost would make any 'victory' pyhrric and I guarantee the west will not pay to rebuild the damage.

As it is right now this war will destroy any chance of a Ukrainian state to actually survive this conflict; they've had too many people leave, too much destruction, and have lost territories that account for about 50% of pre-war GDP, which they will not be getting back.

This is probably the decisive moment for this war. At a bare minimum a limited tactical victory for Russia seems certain, but how much that victory can be limited remains to be seen. 

In the aftermath of this I wonder just how decisive of a factor the Izyum bridgehead being halted in its tracks will end up being. The Russian breakout occurring around Popasna instead of Izyum probably substantially limited what Russia can achieve strategically in the area.",acba888dd83b587d86d074726be936e4880c6cdc,True,False,,,,,0,1653149084,,0,{},i9go2ju,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t3_uuln25,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9go2ju/,1653149100,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653120284.0,

&gt;Sure bro...

Army engineers helped Marine engineers create a breach in the berm outside Fallujah, yep. 

Meanwhile, Marines MAGTFs in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and the Pacific are often nowhere near Army units, which is why there is no second A in MAGTF, for Army attachments. It's all supposed to be organic. And now some of those resources are gone. 

You saying ""don't worry ____ will be there and they'll provide it"" is the exact bullshit response as to why MAGTF were created and why the USMC has its own air wing, because experience taught them not to trust people who suggest they shouldn't worry about support. 

&gt;No, they are focusing on different things.The policy papers put out by the Commandant make it clear that the new focus is contested islands in the Pacific. 

So I say they are ignoring everything that isn't China and your reply is that I'm wrong because they're actually focusing on different things, then you mention the littoral A2AD mission in the South China Sea as that only different thing, which is exactly what I just said. You just reinforced what I said: They're focusing on different thing, singular, and ignoring everything else they have done and still will do. 

&gt;The Corps requires special focus to remain relevant, alongside its ""we'll fight anywhere bro, just tell us where"" mission

That's a bogus argument. The Marine Corps as a service werent in jeopardy. They were already relevant, if fact as this reform was being drafted they were actively deploying USMC forces to Syria over the Army because they were more expeditionary and capable AND POSSESSED LOTS OF TUBE ARTY. 

This was a stunt to get a new mission set based on the 2018 NDS, a mission that allowed the USMC budget to increase by 75% in a single year. A mission the Army couldn't steal, which meant as long as China remains a threat then Marines need to be well funded. 

Meanwhile, as always, the Marines are still expected to fight everywhere. But they're organized and equipped for the Wake Island 2.0 mission in the South China Sea. And that's a problem when they end up fighting outside of the SCS and don't have the assets they need that recent conflicts, including those the USMC fought in, prove are still extremely relevant to the modern battlefield.

&gt;A good reason for less emphasis on mechanized combat and heavy support units like bridges. After all, their asses ride in Navy equipment

Being a former Marine myself, I'm well aware our asses have always ridden around in Navy equipment, and that included them transporting our AFV, especially tanks, that we've used in every conflict we've fought in since WW2. 

Why do we need AFV? Because it turns out humans are squishy meat bags full of fluids that leak out when they get shot or blown up, and armored vehicles that possess heavy weapons and tracks for increased tactical mobility tend to help infantry do things like advance against enemy opposition.

You are now stating AFV aren't needed in warfare and that's a big problem because people who think that way aren't knowledgeable enough about modern warfare to have types of conversations.

They looked at polling data for Zelenskyy and misinterpreted his low-ish approval rating for ""we wish we had a pre-Euromaidan pro-Russian government again, like Lukashenko in Belarus"". It's sometimes difficult to discern what people actually *want* when they're complaining about what they *have*. I think part of the issue may have been a deeply ingrained disregard for the distinct Ukrainian culture. Russia has spent so many decades trying to stamp it out that they started to believe their own propaganda and saw Ukraine as a bunch of ""Russians with a funny accent"". 

&gt; How did they underestimate their logistics challenges?

Yes men. The ""dictator trap"" caused by a strongman government pretty forcefully discourages people from pointing out deficiencies. Mix that with an thriving black market kleptocracy involving everything from selling fuel and rations to outright embezzlement in buying crappy truck tires and charging the government  expense accounts for good ones in order to pocket the difference. Toss in an army heavily laden with inept conscripts and you get what we saw on the road to Kyiv. I'm sure everyone all the way up the chain of command swore they were ready for combat, and just hoped that it would work out.

&gt; Why did they bring such a small force? Typically attacker wants a 3-1 advantage. The USA avoids needing this advantage by achieving absolute air superiority.

See point (1) above. They thought they could roll into Kyiv largely unopposed and flip the government. 
 
&gt; Did the Russians anticipate the Ukrainians having the level of Western support they've received? Both in arms transfers, and intel/command and control?

After 2014, where everyone in the international community just threw out a few sanctions and said ""hey, don't do that"" in response to the annexation of Crimea and Luhansk/Donetsk territory, they likely thought they'd see about the same reaction. I suspect they thought the German natural gas dependency was a stronger lever than it turned out to be. Also, I don't think we can underestimate the role of president Zelenskyy in this. Ultimately, politics in the west runs on public opinion, and he's been instrumental in framing this as a just cause. NATO countries are armed to the teeth with weapons systems specifically designed for smacking down the Russian military, and western military leadership is happy to see it get real-world testing. This is a war they've been preparing for for 60+ years, and even if they can't fight it in person, they're eager to help a close ally they've trained with do it. I suspect Russian leadership mistook western good-naturedness for weakness, and are finding out the truth the hard way.

&gt; What are the Russian goals now, and why do they think they've modified their strategy in a sufficient way to achieve them? 

Hard to tell, but likely they're scrambling for any sort of gain that they can hold onto and reframe as a ""victory"" at home. I don't see any real change in strategy beyond ""set our sights lower"". They still have all the same problems that made the dash to Kyiv fail, so their capacity to extend more than about 150km from  railhead points is limited.  Logistics drives *everything*, and they just don't have a lot to work with.

&gt;Is mobilization off the table?

Never can tell with a nut in charge, but it seems like public tolerance for military conscription is already about at its limit. They already played the ""neighboring countries not being neutral is an existential threat to Russia"" card early on, so it's tough to imagine what their selling point for mobilization for a war *outside Russia* would be.",788a371dfc17eeae30f03a52d044e299fac56196,True,False,,,,,0,1653147192,,0,{},i9gjy0o,False,t3_uuln25,False,True,t1_i9g8cln,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuln25/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_21_2022/i9gjy0o/,1653147208,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653118392.0,

Not to mention lack of training.  Having a bunch of militia just means having to also have a lot of body bags.

&gt;Russia has, ironically, the opposite problem. They have a very large supply of mothballed tanks, troop carriers, and munitions but not enough manpower currently. A lot of it is poorly maintained probably only a fraction is immediately usable- but the sheer number from what I understand is almost endless. This is why you see tanks rolling with 2 men crews without infantry support.

Don't really need a lot of manpower when you have lots of firepower and targeting tech.

Some of my thoughts and quotes:

&gt; * With a high probability, the theater of the “hybrid war” will simply move from Ukraine further east, into the borders of Russia itself, the existence of which in its current form will be in question.

Ukraine is highly unlikely to break all of Russia's ground forces and be able to push into Russia itself. Being this hyperbolic looks the author is trying to portray Russia as a victim in their war of choice, an absurd idea. Furthermore the assertion that this makes the war one that threatens the existence of Russia appears to be crude signaling and an attempt at escalating the crisis to Russia's advantage, as the term ""existence"" invokes the idea of an existential threat, which would justify the use of nuclear weapons. 

&gt; * In other words, the ""great game"" has ceased to be a game. It has become a war - total, but so far a hybrid one, since at present the armed conflict in Ukraine is of an indirect nature.

How can a war be both total and indirect? The author seems to want it both ways; the war is not going well, so therefore the West in engaged in a *Total War*. However it is not direct because there is no contact with Western militaries, yet it is direct warfare with the Ukrainians whom have proved to be an equal opponent. 

&gt; * This circumstance almost completely nullifies Russia's former foreign policy strategy towards the United States and Europe, aimed at recognition by the West of Russian security interests, cooperation in matters of global strategic stability and European security, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and building mutually beneficial economic and other ties with America and the European Union.

So before this war Russia was not interfering in the internal affairs of other nations? I do think this is not an accurate portrayal of Russian foreign policy of the last ten years. And the economic ties to Europe were not mutually beneficial but a noose that the Europeans were foolish enough to put around the necks of their own economies. 

&gt; * The continuation of what many now call a “strange war” leads to a prolongation of hostilities, an increase in losses and a decrease in the international prestige of Russia.

&gt; * The solution of most of Russia's other strategic goals directly depends on whether and when it will succeed in achieving strategic success in Ukraine.

&gt; * As part of solving the problems of restructuring foreign economic relations and creating a new model of the world order, the most important areas are cooperation with world powers, China and India, as well as Brazil; with leading regional players - Turkey, ASEAN countries, Gulf States, Iran, Egypt, Algeria, Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, Argentina, Mexico and others.

This sounds like a list of countries that have been neutral and friendly to Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. It reminds me of Rumsfeld and his *new Europe*.",10c95573b5578ad2895ed2b4136e04f85bd394ca,True,False,,,,,0,1653144471,,0,{},i9ge1n9,False,t3_uunvqj,False,True,t3_uunvqj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uunvqj/dmitri_trenin_moscows_defeat_in_ukraine_would/i9ge1n9/,1653144489,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653115671.0,

&gt; * This, and an apparent aversion to risk, persuaded Russian forces not to emphasise aggressive manoeuvres by tanks and infantry, but instead to use its familiar playbook from Chechnya and Syria of saturating urban areas with artillery, rockets and bombs, leading to collateral damage and civilian casualties.

&gt; * Although maps of the region can give the impression that it comprises open agricultural terrain, close inspection of satellite imagery shows that it is much more heavily urbanised. The region contains several large towns, such as Severodonetsk and Kramatorsk, with peacetime populations of 104,000 and 150,000 respectively, and to achieve its objectives Russia will need to control these. This part of Ukraine is also covered with a dense array of small towns, villages and agricultural and mining facilities that dominate the area’s network of metalled roads and are often only a few kilometres apart.

&gt; * Such tactics are battle-proven. For example in Normandy in July 1944, an attack by three British armoured divisions, preceded by carpet bombing by Allied bombers, was brought to a standstill by a much smaller German force of infantry and a few anti-tank guns that used these tactics in a network of small villages on Bourguébus Ridge. This unsuccessful attack, known as Operation Goodwood, was extensively studied by the British Army in the 1970s, who practised using similar tactics to stop a Soviet armoured attack among the farming villages and dormitory towns around the German city of Hanover.

&gt; * Over the coming weeks and months the battle in the Donbas will probably be dominated by artillery, which may well become the main source of casualties on both sides. And civilians who will not or cannot leave towns and villages near the frontline are likely to suffer as well.

&gt; * …rapidly defeating a layered combined arms defence with a high density of troops well equipped with anti-tank weapons, tanks and artillery would challenge the most effective of Nato armies.

Guess we found one living in an alternate reality. 

If we're going to talk about the overall situation, we might start by remembering the fact that at the Russian plan was to decapitate the ukranian government in a 3 hour operation and put a puppet government in place. After that failed, they switched to sending a 40 miles long convoy to kyiv in hopes of overwhelming it's defences, which also failed spectacularly, despite everyone predicting kyiv would fall within a few days. 

Now jumping all the way to today, Ukraine has successfully repelled the Russians from multiple fronts, got way more weapons than anyone would have imagined, destroyed thousands of Russian heavy equipment, killed several of their generals and is currently amassing a huge army for counteroffensives in the summer, while Russia has literally no where else to take fresh forces from without mobilising.

""But hey, the situation looks very bad, Russia is about to take Severodonetsk"". 

Is this kind of rethoric meant to be taken seriously? BTW, anyone who expects Ukraine to come out of this with 100% of their previous territory should probably adjust their expectations. 

This is a war of survival for Ukraine .fortunately, Ukraine has already won that war, it remains to be decided wether it is able to make that victory greater by retaking some or all territory back, but that shouldn't be considered an easy task nor guaranteed.

One question I have is, what does the military consider a 'part' for logistics purposes? It seems to me that if you're using a standard interface, then so long as the targeting system talks the standard, then it could be internally made of whatever components you have available, and you could just swap the whole thing out if its broken (which would probably be necessary anyway - repairing modern circuitry is not very easy). 

The second question is, why aren't countries like Russia rolling out guidance kits? One thing that perplexes me is that when stuff like the Granit missile was being developed, the guidance system would have been very technically challenging, especially with 70's Russian computers. Today, it's something your average masters student could do.

&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was structured, trained and equipped by Stalin’s Soviet Army from its inception.

I'm honestly not too familiar with the Soviet military, but China's military (officially founded in 1949 as the PLA but can trace its roots a bit earlier) and the Soviet Union's military fought drastically different conflicts. I'm unaware of the post 49 PLA having any Soviet advisors (or any foreign advisors for that matter), and while there were senior Chinese military officers (such as Peng Dehuai) who visited and learned from the Soviets, I'm not convinced that their impact either then nor today is as big as the article implies. 

The next portion of the article hails the 2001 Sino-Russian friendship treaty between Putin and Jiang as a sort of turning point in China-Russia relations, which I have no argument with. However, this, and other common general diplomatic platitudes of friendship and cooperation don't do anything to support the main argument of the article that China based its military modernization off that of Russia's. The article then goes onto some bullet points that state among other things that China and Russia's equipment is ""basically the same"" which is factually untrue, and the similarities with political systems is IMO undermined by the Sino Soviet Split.

Sections 2 and 3 are very dense and the author has clearly done his share of research. I'm honestly impressed by the amount of detail that the author goes into, though I'm not convinced that similarities in reforms (such as the TCs and the trimming of manpower) will actually result in similarities in practice.

The 4th section goes over military relations today and starts with joint operations and interoperability. However, none of the exercises (nor geopolitical realities) really seem suggest the possibility that the Russian and Chinese military will ever actually work side by side in a conflict. The next section on military technology cooperation also seems to overstate the amount of similarities in Chinese and Russian equipment today.

Overall this isn't a bad article in the sense as the author clearly has done his research, but some parts seem a bit surface level and don't really seem to support the argument that the author makes.",2673448d0151967add4396187bfe337a48489131,True,False,,,,,0,1653109095,,0,{},i9f1lx0,False,t3_uudh65,False,True,t3_uudh65,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uudh65/learning_from_russia_how_china_used_russian/i9f1lx0/,1653109109,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653080295.0,

Main findings and conclusions

* This paper challenges the common assumption among military analysts that China’s military reforms are driven by strategic competition with the United States and inspired by changes in the US military as the sole template.

* China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been considerably influenced by Russian doctrine, force structuring and equipment from its inception and continues to draw heavily on the Russian experience.

* Since coming to power, Xi Jinping has used military reforms to reestablish firm control over the PLA in much the same way as Russian President Vladimir Putin wielded his role as Commander-in-Chief after the Russian military’s poor performances in Chechenya and Georgia.

* The establishment of the PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) seems to have been inspired by the Russian model. China’s military officers and strategists continue to be schooled in Russian thinking on “new generation warfare” and have identified the Russian strategy as a key battle-winning factor.

* Joint training has become a major facet of Sino-Russian military cooperation and has been expanded from land, air and sea exercises to embrace sensitive fields like information and antimissile technology.

* Delving deeper into Russian military thinking and doctrines will be important to forecast the likely future trajectory of PLA reform.

Quotes:

&gt; * China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was structured, trained and equipped by Stalin’s Soviet Army from its inception. The entire PLA military leadership cut their teeth in Russia and adopted Russian military doctrines, concepts and thinking in the early years of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Even when policy differences or the clashing egos of Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev led to tensions, the PLA continued to rely on Russian military thinking. This has been especially true in the armaments and aviation industries.

&gt; * This paper challenges the common wisdom among military analysts that China’s military reforms are driven by strategic competition with the United States and inspired by changes in the US military. It is certainly true that US military prowess has triggered Chinese military thinking on upgrading PLA forces – for instance swift US military success in the invasions of Kuwait (1990-1991) and of Iraq in 2003 (whatever may be said about that mission’s later problems). More recently, the US display of technology and missilery in Syria, Afghanistan and Libya has stimulated rethinking. However, it is one-sided to view the US as the sole template. This paper argues that PLA reforms continue to draw heavily on the Russian experience as well.

&gt; * In general, militaries are changeaverse and require a “top down” directive to undertake revolutionary or disruptive changes. For instance, it took the US Senate’s Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1986 to push through a deep transformation of the US army. China’s Goldwater-Nichols moment came in 2012 when Xi announced the creation of five Joint Theatre Commands and other groundbreaking directives.

&gt; * The updated Military Doctrine that Putin issued in 2014 noted the diminishing probability of Russia facing largescale attacks, referring instead to ‘unresolved regional conflicts’. This essentially offensive military strategy was complemented by a meticulously shaped concept of information warfare as an enabler to achieve military goals.8 It was, and is, an aspirational strategy aimed at making Russia great again, that has many echoes in the “China Dream” promulgated by Xi.

&gt; * In China, the main political drivers of military reforms have been the desire to tighten civilian political control over the PLA, and the need to curb rampant corruption inside the military. Shortly before he came to power, Xi’s ascent to the presidency was threatened by his rival Bo Xilai and Bo’s cohorts in the PLA.9 When Xi assumed office, he was therefore faced with the urgent need for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to rein in the military.10

&gt; * Xi’s reform of the PLA echoes measures initiated by Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov and his successor Sergey Shoygu around the beginning of this decade. Xi has used military reforms to reestablish firm control over the PLA in much the same way as Putin wielded his role as Commander-in-Chief after the Russian military’s poor performances in Chechenya and Georgia.

&gt; * In January 2016, Xi formally approved sweeping changes that were strongly reminiscent of the Serdyukov reforms in Russia, and took the form of restructuring of the Higher Defense Organization. Serdyukov had faced strong resistance from the military’s upper echelons. Xi’s planners managed to avoid this by moving swiftly. Xi’s so-called “Above-the-neck Reforms” scrapped the four powerful General Departments and reconfigured the CMC into 15 sections; seven departments, three commissions and five directly affiliated offices. The reconfiguration gave the PLA Higher Defense Organization (HDO) an entirely new look. Power was divested and spread horizontally, with all these sections made responsible to the CMC. The PLA emerged with a flatter and less hierarchal structure.

&gt; * Chinese restructuring of the Group Armies into Combined Corps (CCs) and Combined Arms Brigades (CABs) copied the Russian model of the 58 Combined Arms Army (CAA) in Ukraine. Although 18 Group Armies have morphed into 13 Combined Corps and roughly 82 Combined Arms Brigades, the structure is still evolving. During the author’s visit to units of the Beijing Military Division in October 2018, he observed that the 1st Guards Division (note, Division not Brigade) had Motorized Regiments on its order of battle, rather than Combined Arms Brigades.26

&gt; * China’s military planners have clearly picked up lessons from Chechenya and Georgia, and applied them to overcoming the challenges of delayed and cumbersome mobilization, as well as of training and integration, by placing all components of warfighting under one commander. Each of the PLA’s CABs has up to four Combined Arms Battalions (CAB) which are similar in structure, equipment, roles and capability to the Russian Brigade Tactical Groups (BTG) which were employed in Ukraine.28

&gt; * The phenomenal increase in the firepower component, especially Long Range Vectors, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, Multiple Barrel Rocket Launchers and Drones/UAV, in the Combined Armies and Motorised Brigades seems to suggest that the PLA may be following the Russian model in viewing the deployment of artillery as a “finishing arm”

It will then be up to Ukraine to dislodge the Russians or join negotiations.

\- hubris lead to poor logistics in the belief of a quick war.

\- Hitler made decisions on the (tactical?) level instead of leaving that stuff to subordinates.

\- a few more issues that I can't remember at the moment.

In current news (US), I've noticed recently that it seems these issues that plagued the German army in WWII almost 1:1 are being attributed to the current invading Russian army in their fatal mistakes, but what recently caught my attention was a CNN video stating that (according to intelligence), Putin is directing the Russian army at the tactical level and a general in the CNN video corroborated this. This immediately reminded me of what Hitler is said to have done with his army in the east.

My question is, is this true that Putin is doing this? Because I've been noticing many similarities between Hitler's supposed mistakes and Putin's supposed mistakes in current media. The logistics issue I can see because Putin maybe thought Ukraine would be as easy as Crimea in the same way Hitler thought Russia might be as easy as France.

But with the abundance of books on these faults of the German army in WWII, I feel that Putin would at least be familiar with the popular mistakes and at the very least wouldn't go as far as doing the Hitler's controlling-army-at-tactical-level mistake, which seems to be one of the more popular mistakes.",1e4226188902ba8f36efe094510ce667b37d64c2,True,False,,,,,0,1653096918,,0,{},i9egda6,False,t3_uqwn4u,False,True,t3_uqwn4u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqwn4u/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i9egda6/,1653096932,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653068118.0,
