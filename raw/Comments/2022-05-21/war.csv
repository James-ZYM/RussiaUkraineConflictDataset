[],False,,somethingcontentious,,,[],,,,text,t2_j4w6e8m7,False,False,"Often made but not an accurate comparison. In the early 90's Iraq had the 3rd largest military and choose to do what Russia is doing right now but to Kuwait. They planned to annex Kuwait, take it's wealth, control its ports, and repopulate it with Iraqis. Unfortunately for Iraq they didn't understand how much money the world made off Kuwait oil and so months of warning and military build up followed. Because Iraq wasn't a UN Security Council member they got virtually no political cover for this stunt. The deadline past for Iraq to leave Kuwait and the first war started and Iraq was quickly defeated, pulled out of Kuwait, and agreed to a large number of UN terms. Including some disarmament, end to wmd production, no fly zone.... 
For the next 10 years Iraq violated these agreements non-stop, smuggling things through sanctions, targeting aircraft enforcing the no fly, harassing shipping, stopping UN WMD inspections, and creating the impression, presumably as a deterrent, that Iraq still had WMD.  On the side Iraq also had loose involvement with various ""terrorist"" groups or at least allowed their presence, including Al Qaida as far back as 1999. Then along came 2001 and the US became less tolerant of Iraq's behavior and got tired of having their aircraft targeted and ships harassed, along with having what they thought/claimed was evidence of Iraq WMD, see Powell UN speach, and probably assumed a new Iraqi leader would be good for oil prices and business in general and help contain Iran.  So the US somewhat by itself went to war. The difference here was that the US never intended to make Iraq it's territory, to replace Iraqis with Texans or New Yorkers, not to totally destroy the infrastructure (yes infrastructure was destroyed during the invasion but no where on the level of Ukraine, not even after 20 years), or destroy it's cultural heritage. The US was going to go in quick, making the same mistake as Russia today by not committing sufficient forces, destroy the WMD, destroy the ability to targert Isreal (who I'm sure pushed the US all the way to invade but never sends any of it's own people), remove the government and put some more favorable person in there to do whatever they please as long as it didn't support ""terrorism"", threaten Isreal or the gulf Arabs, and was pro business at least with respect to oil. 
Everything was going well then Iraqis decided to kill each other over power and religion and ethnicity. Once again like Afghanistan the US got stuck occupying and trying to secure and rebuild a nation.  Keep in mind this was an administration that broke it's back not to spend money on American's so the only upside to spending money in Iraq for them was so they could funnel US tax payer dollars back to rich Americans who own defence companies. Unlike Russian in Ukraine they had no interest in building an empire or taking Iraq and turning it into a US territory with US culture. The US wanted to take the fast and forceful approach to dealing with Iraq's UN violations, deal with what at the time was a small ""terrorism"" issue, and create a government more favorable to US interests like corporate profit and fighting Iran. That's the difference and it's pretty big.",5e0959b8256240dcbe7ff24fd9c13567dc996951,True,True,,,,,0,1653106850,,0,{},i9eyamw,False,t3_ut2pbn,False,False,t3_ut2pbn,/r/war/comments/ut2pbn/russia_requested_nato_membership_in_the_late_90s/i9eyamw/,1653106866,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1653078050.0

Are you sure you're against fascism??

**Your Sources**
I don't need to discredit them bec none of them report from the front-line, they're embedded with the Ukranians and despite being invited do not report the Russian perspective. They are simply biased. Whereas, real Western journalists who report from the war zone criticise the Russians too. 

The reason I cited Newsweek is bec they are no friends of the Russians so, _it's likely they're telling the truth_. There's _no reason_ to doubt the USAF and Pentagon officials speaking anonymously either. Maybe you don't get this logic since you're exposed to a 24x7 media narrative, online censorship &amp; suppression you don't hear it.

The Russians never said they wanted to occupy Kiev. They miscalculated and changed their strategy. Those long columns so much was made about were used to 'fix' Ukranian forces in place. They've been successful since then and have taken over almost the entire East. Listen to what surrendered Ukranians have radioed back to HQ before giving up it maybe you don't get that on Ukranian telegram channels??

As I'm given to understand it's not B&amp;W as some lazy pundits make it look. 

As an aggressor army the Russians went in with 1:3 ratio of troops vs Ukranians, against every rule in the book. When the US invaded Iraq they went in with a _4:1 multiplier!_ 

Again- such definitions of 'Shock &amp; Awe' are Western inventions not Russian doctrine.

They implemented tactics from Syria which was to bypass and encircle cities opening humanitarian corridors to let civilians out. In comparison, to US Shock &amp; Awe in Aleppo, Mosul, Raqqa etc where Amnesty and HRW blamed them for over 10,000 civilian deaths. 

Apart from the Pentagon and USAF officials who confirmed the Russians were not targeting civilians it's important to remember this is Ukraine. 

_The Russians view the majority of Ukranians as slavic brothers._ They don't want to antagonize the civilian population. It simply isn't in their interest and western journalists who visit these places confirm this. This is one reason they are going very slowly and choosing their targets. The Newsweek article talks about this. 

Recent reports by the WaPo and NYT again- no friends of the Russians - confirmed that Ukranians were placing armour within residential areas which attracted Russian bombardment. I don't want to labour this point bec until Western media don't go to the Russian side of Donbass and speak to survivors rather, selectively editing their quotes then playing it back with clickbait we can keep trading sources.

**Brutality and Atrocities**
This is a war and there's no doubt going to be innocent people losing lives. 

When the US invaded Iraq they bombed it for 2 weeks before the first boots crossed the border. They flew over 100,000 missions in that period, whereas, the Russians flew 8000 missions in the first 45 days! _The US bombing of Baghdad cost 7000 lives in the first 3 days_, whereas, the _Russian bombing has cost 900 lives in the first 45 days as per the UN!_ You can choose to ignore this comparison as whataboutism but it puts it in perspective.

The stuff about Bucha, the theatre bombing makes zero sense. It has to be investigated bec **it makes no sense whatsoever.** _Even the Pentagon just admitted yesterday when John Kirby tried to sweep the report of US drones killing 70 women and children in Syria under the carpet._ Only an investigation can say what happened and even the WaPo of all people have raised some questions on Bucha!

Kramatorsk too was falsely blamed. The BBC mistakenly debunked the station bombing when they showed serial nos on the tickets as belonging to Ukraine and the story disappeared from cable news overnight! 

Whereas there are multiple examples of Ukranians brutality. The NYT confirmed videos of Russian PoWs being shot and tortured on camera, of Ukranian neo Nazis calling Russian soldiers families and showing them their dead bodies, of using civilians as human shields again- this was confirmed even by the WaPo the most neocon of publications.

This is a war. There's bound to be atrocities by soldiers who are human. It doesn't justify it. _The issue around this entire subject of whether this war was necessary and the overwhelming response is- No._ The Ukrainian govt is a puppet govt this is not a debate anymore but the role of the US in interfering and pushing this towards war is evident. 

In 2016 Lindsey Graham and John McCain went to Ukraine and said _2017 was the year to make Russia pay._ Adam Schiff said proudly in Congress that, _""we fight Russia over there so we don't have to fight them over here""._ **Since when we we at war with Russia?? For whom??**  _Ukraine is a pawn in a wider game_ and the sooner you realise this instead of pushing this neocon bullshit the better for everyone. 

It also pant as if Ukraine is a beacon of Democracy. TIME, BBC, WSJ, Guardian etc have all reported on the Nazi problem in Ukraine. Not the majority of Ukranians but a sizeable problem that is now part of the military and want nuclear weapons!

The world went to war twice bec of Europe. Let's hope sabre rattling by the ultra-right leaning Baltic States, Poland and necons in the UK don't draw the two biggest superpowers with the largest nuclear weapons arsenal into WW3 simply because _**you're willing to believe everything you're told in order to get the better of Russia.**._",327fb4ddb50ab8bd17722428075d62f34b7c2d20,True,False,,,,,0,1653091268,,0,{},i9e5s7k,False,t3_tx3xte,False,True,t1_i9ckgch,/r/war/comments/tx3xte/captured_russian_bomber_known_for_killing_a_lot/i9e5s7k/,1653091279,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1653062468.0
