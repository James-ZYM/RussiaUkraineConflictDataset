The first time as far as I am aware I've EVER used a pro-russian twitter as a source is 2 days ago where I used [Suriyak here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/us0uqz/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51822/i98roj4/). Why did I start here? Because Popasna was developing fast and liveuamap is slow to update and I knew Russian maps were more bullish on Russian gains so I went and found one.

Suriyak is the ONLY pro-russian account I remember using and I only used Russian With Attitude because it was the first tweet I found quoting about 2.5k defenders and quoting a source, in this case ""Head of the DPR Pushilin"".

Hardly ""habitual"".

&gt; 2 claims from you that Russian [regular] deaths were less than 10k
(I added [regular] since you misrepresented what I said)

Yes and I immediately conceded I wasn't up to date when you presented a more logical argument for the death numbers.

&gt; 6k Ukrainian PoWs

Given you my reasoning. Still seems reasonable to me. Russia encircled a well defended city, it seems quite logical that it would result in thousands of POWs. What do you think the ""true"" number of Azovstal defenders are that surrendered? 500?

&gt; but why you pro Russians feel a need to hide behind the veil of neutrality befuddles me.

Because I'm not pro-Russian. I'm not pro-Ukrainian either. I'm not cheering for a side like a football team. Maybe, perhaps you are, my neutrality comes across as opposition? I have no ""loyalty"" to either side. I'm neither Ukrainian nor Russian. I'm an Englishmen and the extent of my emotional attachment to one side is a slight satisfaction at seeing how well our NLAWs did as repentance for Russia poisoning some of our civilians on our own soil a few years back.",870a76e93f172093acc0254761de17f506632f79,True,False,,,,,0,1653177310,,0,{},i9i9c7q,False,t3_uu5m7q,False,True,t1_i9i7oed,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu5m7q/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_52122/i9i9c7q/,1653177328,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653148510.0,

I'm not in the habit of collecting sources. I'm simply using my memory from reading months of these threads. I remember numbers in the 1000s and low 2000s being thrown about.

Ultimately, Yugoslavia was a nation that, while getting some limited aid, did end up fighting fiercely against nazi occupation right up until Germany fell.

I myself have estranged relatives in Argentina, the descendands of people wh, to save their own lives, ended up cooperating with the Germans.. but had to flee because they were accused of being collaborators and would surely have been killed.

Close to where I live is a closed off mine shaft, when I was a teen, me and my buddies would ride our mopeds up there to that old abandoned and sealed shaft, to sneakily light a forbidden cigarette and mess around.

10 years ago a local elderly man who was on his last legs, contacted the police to turn himself in, his story was that he was participating in the murder of people by driving the tractor with the concrete that was used to seal off the old mine shaft when he was a teen... said he lived with constant nightmares and guilt for his whole life.. I knew the man, he was a bit of a loner but always friendly and looked kind.

When Antropologiats and forrensics came and broke trough, they found scratched walls on the inside.. and over 500 bodies.. men, women and children, burried alive. A lot of them were Croatian Ustaša and Slovenian home-guard who tried to escape to Austria with their families when Germany lost, but were turned back by the British at the border.

The same place where I sneakily smoked cigarettes and fooled around with my buddies on our mopeds as teens, 75 years ago saw a young boy of a similar age to mine, drive a tractor with concrete to bury 500 people alive in an abandoned mine shaft.

Thing is, Tito didn't order any of the killings, it was all Partisans who were thirsting for revenge for their murdered relatives and destroyed homes acting on their own.., he did turn a blind eye to it however, possibly believing there was no way to stop it without causing a civil war.
Similarly it happened to Italians living on the Yugoslav side, Italy had interned 1/4 of our capital in concentration camps, starving many to death.. when Italy and Germany lost, there was a lot of revenge on peoples mind.

Another interesting thing nowadays, Italy wants to clasify the revenge killings(foibe massacres) as Genocide/cleansing, but very very few Italians today have any idea about the concentration camps for Slovenes and Croats, and the ethnic cleansing they commited prior to the revenge killings.",dff41b0730be72ed52785539afa8d563655c1797,True,False,,,,,0,1653171737,,0,{},i9hyw6o,False,t3_uuwqxu,False,True,t1_i9hvmfo,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uuwqxu/ustase_getting_ready_to_cut_the_head_off_of_a/i9hyw6o/,1653171754,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653142937.0,

ATGMs are guided (hence the G), so as long as you have enough visibility you can correct your shot and hit moving targets. In fact you can see the shooter overcorrects and puts the missile back on target, as it jerks to the left a few seconds before impact.

Guiding is done usually via wire (wrapped around the missile, unfolds as it files away) or via laser.

.. the Croatian Ustaša were Ethnically cleansing the Serbs in the same way the Germans did with Jewish and other Slavic people.
They even had special knives they called ""Srbosjek"" which roughly translates to ""Serb cutter"", it was designed like a glove with a sharp blade attached to the hand opposite the thumb, it was a repurposed agricultural farmers tool.. farmers would use it to have quick access to a blade that wouldn't get in the way while collecting and tying wheat bushels, Croats took that and repurposed it to be the optimal tool for cutting throats.

With this knife they staged competitions, not unlike the Japanese katana cutting competitions killing Chinese, they(the Croatian Ustaša) would compete in who can cut more throats of captive Serbian people in an alocated time.

It was partially the reason for the Brutality which Serbians unleashed in the 90's...

Most people are in agreement that Russia's military decisions in the opening weeks of the war were because Putin believed that they could shock and awe their way to Kyiv, overthrow the government and the army would stand down.

When this didn't work, Russia then seemed to take the gigabrain decision to keep trying the same thing under the assumption that if they pushed just a little more it would all collapse in their favor. During all this they were facing unbelievable amounts of attrition. Russia basically choose the worse possible military strategy you could do against an enemy who was willing to give us as much ground as needed.

Now they're butting heads directly against entrenched Ukrainian positions and are able to bring their artillery to bear properly, seemingly with no shortage of munitions. They're doing what they do best which is levelling their enemies through sheer material might. These entrenched positions are not simply land that Ukraine will be happy to give up. These are defensive positions 8 years in the making Ukraine are having to retreat from.

Russia is demonstrating it is able to secure and consolidate right now. Izium and Popasna are the best examples of this. The rate of ambushes and attrition for Russia has gone down while it has gone up for Ukraine while Russia has started grinding its way through town by town city by city, instead of doing what it did previously and just drive through towns without securing them and getting ambushed.

I think its clear now that Russia understands that the war goal is now to defeat the AFU in direct conflict rather than through magically overthrowing Zelensky.",6ccb17e09ff0b4dce71e30c5339223bba10fe2de,True,False,,,,,0,1653169037,,0,{},i9htobb,False,t3_uu5m7q,False,True,t1_i9hqold,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu5m7q/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_52122/i9htobb/,1653169054,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653140237.0,

Here is the example of where the M1A2 stores it.

Now, the thing is, the US has stored ammo in the same space as Russian tanks, and some NATO tanks do as well, and its actually not THAT big of a deal as people make it seem, its just funny because of the turrets popping off, but at the end of the day, the same hit is going to disable both tanks, just M1A2 wont have a pop off turret.

The main reason the T-80 and others have that is because of the loader system. the US still uses a manual loader which is an extra crewman. The T-80 only needs 3, where as the M1A2 needs 2 because of the loader. 

They both also store ammo in the back, so thats another area thats going to send them up into flames if they get hit there.",77d0f2bf7411ae887ff8f7f7bc98f89916396777,True,False,,,,,0,1653168528,,0,{},i9hsou7,False,t3_uurgja,False,True,t1_i9hs6f9,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uurgja/russian_t72b3_tanks_targeted_by_ukrainian/i9hsou7/,1653168543,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653139728.0,

Read through the reports from the 16th of Feb to about the 22nd/23rd of Feb.

Pay attention to the maps, and the number of ceasefire violations. Look where the explosions are, where the largest numbers are. 

I'd recommend reading the article by Jacques Baud on how this all started. He's a former NATO intelligence officer, and UN official.

The invasion and its cause is maybe not as crystal clear as the western media has portrayed it if you take what he says seriously.

Before people call this guy a Putin apologist. He literally dedicated his entire life to NATO intelligence during the cold war and the UN. https://labourheartlands.com/jacques-baud-the-military-situation-in-the-ukraine-update/",e175298d1f91f068102a702426f08825cafeb2b0,True,False,,,,,0,1653166669,,0,{},i9hp1k3,False,t3_uu4wjt,False,True,t1_i9foe1m,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu4wjt/mariupol_azovstal_fight_near_the_tunnel/i9hp1k3/,1653166688,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653137869.0,

982,[],False,,Mercbeast,,,[],,,,text,t2_npfym,False,False,"If I remember correctly. The Vehicle was 100% a Ukrainian air defence unit. The context is, there are multiple views of the incident. 

In the immediate prelude to the footage everyone is familiar with, a military truck is seen barreling down a road, perhaps a side road, or perhaps the same road that the car was crushed on. It is taking heavy fire. I don't know if anyone knows 100% or not outside of those who were directly involved, if this was a Russian saboteur, or, if this was a Ukrainian who was mistaken as a Russian saboteur. This was in the immediate aftermath of civilians being armed, and Russia appearing to be sending infiltration units into Kyiv.

The truck eventually stops, and the driver, shot, falls out, takes cover behind a wheel well (I think), while Ukrainians pour fire at him from multiple directions, culminating in a fairly close range execution. At some point during all of this, a military vehicle drives past and the camera panned to it. (Keep in mind this is months ago so I am going by memory, some of these events may be conflated with similar video, so best advice is to look up the videos in question yourself). Shortly after, another vehicle drives past, a Ukrainian strela-10 I think it was, drives past, while heavy fire is happening just a few meters off the road it is driving down. It SEEMS to serve to avoid the shoulder of the road, overcorrects and swerves across the road, where it strikes the car. 

The theories at the time were, the driver lost control due to an over correction, probably because of the gun fire to his right. Some theories were that it was a hijacked vehicle and a Russian was driving it. However, it seemed unlikely because nobody was actually shooting at it. Moreover, in another video, this is clearly a straggler to a much larger column of vehicles that had passed shortly beforehand. Like within a couple minutes.

I think the likely scenario is, it was a Ukrainian driving. They had fallen behind their column of armored vehicles. The active small arms fire to the vehicles right spooked the driver. The driver thought he was under fire, took evasive action, looked to have over steered it, lost control and ran over a civilian car. Luckily the civilians in the car didn't die if I recall correctly.

In anycase, there are I believe 3 different videos of this incident. The top down video. The video from ground level of the guy in the Truck getting shot, which shows the civilian car being run over, in the background, and finally there is another video which shows the immediate aftermath, with Ukrainian soldiers hanging out around the strela-10 that ran over the car. There is actually I think one more video from just before all of this happened, that showed the convoy of armored vehicles driving down that road. Which is why people think this strela-10 had fallen behind/gotten separated from its unit and was trying to catch up.",d5ae3cb3cfbee1956bc524ddf9dcab50ab539470,True,False,,,,,0,1653165539,,0,{},i9hmrjr,False,t3_uu4wjt,False,True,t1_i9fnowa,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu4wjt/mariupol_azovstal_fight_near_the_tunnel/i9hmrjr/,1653165551,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653136739.0,

Second, we don't know what happened to them, because we didn't see them get used. It's possible they were all wasted in the first few days. It's possible they were used improperly. It's possible they got blown up in warehouses in the opening days.

What we do know is, there was little to no reporting of manpads being used in Afghanistan. We know stingers are effective when used properly. We know they shot down lots of Soviet Helicopters. If they had hundreds kicking around in 2001, then it seems rational to assume that some of the helicopter kills we suffered would have been a result of stingers.

Its always the most well off people who find every reason to hate the reasons they're well off, America isnt perfect but it is far from a shit stain on the earth. Its like hearing rich kids hating on their parents for every inconvenience they can find, their comfort makes it so easy to just absolutely hate what brings them that comfort.

Theres a reason the united states has such high immigration, people want to live here because living here is pretty nice (not some perfect utopia with 0 problems, but still quit nice). You just cant see how well you have it because you're already here. You might not feel like it, but you are privileged to live where you do, dont take that privilege for granted.

America isnt the greatest country ever, but its definitely not a ""shithole stain"" as you said. Whatever that means. If anything, hate the government for all of its bullshitery it pulls instead of just saying the whole country is terrible. Saying America sucks because of things the government does (like your apparent qualms with how weve done stuff in the middle east) is literally like saying and entire culture is bad because some terrorists exist in said culture. It feels reductive.

Tl;Dr: you more than likely have it very well if you live in America and should probably do more to realize and appreciate that, of course shit can still be difficult, we're not perfect in any way and we have some serious problems that need adressing but its definitely not a ""shithole stain on the earth"".

If you are talking about sea gas shelf's - they are in Black Sea, not Azov sea. If you mean gas/oil shelf in Donbass region - it's mostly shale gas.

Not quite. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia is mostly dry steppe (we even have actual desert there - Oleshkivsky pisky). So it's not fertile land, more like ""just land"" where we dump a shitload of fertilizer.
Fertile farmland ""chornozem"" is mostly north (Vinnytsya, Kropyvnytsky, Cherkasy, Poltava)

I'm also aware of Ukraine, prior to this war, and know that Ukraine has its own regional culture, which is proven by the simple fact there is enough difference in the language spoken that there is a need for a distinction between Ukrainian and Russian.  


You think I'm brainwashed by western media when I don't even watch TV - no local news, no cable news, no talk shows. I read articles from multiple sources daily. None of those sources are state-owned media controlled by a government, unlike RU news which is spewing this bullshit about nazis in Ukraine. The prime minister of Israel literally spoke to Putin on a phone call and told him Ukraine does not have an issue with a Nazi ""infiltration"" of their government or country. Why do you think virtually every country worldwide, not just the ""west"" is against this war? Is it a world full of Nazis all conspiring against the ""pure"" Putin and pure Russians? I've seen clips of state-run Russian news and it's absolutely sick. The concept that NATO wants to invade Russia? NATO was created as a defensive alliance. If NATO wanted to invade Russia, it would have been done by now, especially while Russia is weakened and preoccupied with a war against Ukraine. There's about $900b spent on defense annually within NATO against approximately $70b annually in Russia, and even less in years prior. This is precisely why Putin keeps threatening the world with nukes and the rest of the world is not even considering the use of nuclear weapons.  


All Putin has done is unite NATO, and strengthen it with the future additions of Finland and Sweden, with Finland throwing away about two centuries of neutrality (besides defending themselves against past Russian invasions), all due to the hostile and unprovoked attacks of Russia. They want to join NATO because they want additional protection against Russia attacking them next. They're not interested in joining because they wish to attack Russia. Wake up dude, Putin is driving Russia into hell - he's your enemy, not Ukraine, and not NATO.  


He's already fear-mongering and stating NATO will create military bases and place missiles in Finland once they join, but that's not happening. The US and EU have no reason to place defenses in Finland due to their large reserve forces which they can mobilize to defend their country, and NATO is not launching any attack across Finland's border or any other NATO-Russian border. There's also the fact Finland has stated they don't want foreign forces to establish any permanent military sites within their territory, which will obviously be honored.  


So it comes down to one question. Do you truly think 90% of all nations are in on a massive conspiracy against Russia, or is Putin using all of his power to convince the population he controls that there's a false reason to invade Ukraine? Please, wake up; all you're doing is supporting the loss of young Russians who shouldn't be crossing a border to murder others and die far too young at the order of a sociopath for absolutely no reason. If you can't tell from pretty much every independent news organization worldwide, Russia is losing against Ukraine and has already lost objectively due to the strengthening of NATO, which is the entire reason Putin actually attacked - out of fear of Ukraine applying to join NATO.",6f9770459580889fe75db752f5029db7ed8b9ae0,True,False,,,,,0,1653158642,,0,{},i9h8r4g,False,t3_utvn6g,False,False,t1_i9g1kg7,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utvn6g/russian_missile_strike_on_the_house_of_culture_in/i9h8r4g/,1653158657,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653129842.0,

1.  The first narrative is Russia really is the great Bear, Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv were just learning experiences and they are now using their vaunted army appropriately.  At the same time Ukraine is really outnumbered by equipment, quality troops etc. and they are losing right now despite all their best efforts with no realistic way of re-arming or putting more troops in the field in a meaningful way.  

2.  On the other hand, maybe Ukraine is building up a large counter attacking force, with superior Western equipment and is allowing Russia to expensively and exhaustively take ground with the extent of even allowing a siege that they expect to be able to break in a full counter attack.  For instance allowing a siege while they break the Northern elements.

My own conjecture:

You're right that something doesn't make sense. If Ukraine truly was working with a ""defense in depth"" strategy, and have sufficient manpower/ammo/heavy weapon systems then why was Popasna allowed to become the breakthrough it has? I'm seeing a lot of talk on Russian twitter about Russia making headway in their Karkiv counter attack. I really suspect Ukrainian offenses in this area were spoiling attacks attempting to draw units away from the rest of the front.

People talking about how they've identified a lack of a second line of defense in this area from satellite photos. Reports from reporters on the ground, returning interviews of volunteer fighters as well as videos of small numbers of Ukrainians refusing to fight paint a negative but *consistent* picture about a lack of food/ammo general logistics and coordination with artillery. I've seen consistent reporting now for a two weeks or more there been basically constant bombardment of the Ukrainian defenses.

If Russia can keep this up then we might start to see some large scale retreats by the Ukrainian forces, and I don't think any second line of defense will be any near as entrenched as the Donbass front line that have had 8 years to fortify.

I also have some doubts about the new systems Ukraine is getting being as effective as people say. In basically every video of Ukrainians firing the American M777's there are comments about how *slow* they are. It takes *years* to build up competence to be highly capable with these systems and Russia has centuries of military institutions to act as inertia. Ukraine has a 8 year old army.

People need to remember that nearly everything Ukraine is getting Russia has their own counterpart and have been using it since the start of the war. Most people forget that Russia has thousands of observation drones for artillery spotting and have been using loitering munitions since the start. Russia does indeed have an air-force and are flying ~250 sorties a day. They do indeed have their own intelligence satellites.

That said, I'm still not convinced Russia is going to get the momentum she needs to take the Donbass anytime soon and I am still highly skeptical of any large scale encirclements happen. If they do happen, it will paint a very bad picture of the capability of the Ukrainian forces.

Nor do I intend to paint a picture of super Russian competence. Russia is clearly stretched and stressed as evidence that the Karkiv offensive was a Ukrainian victory in the first place.

Both sides seem to be at a breaking point, and at the moment, Ukraine seems to be breaking a little faster.",f63847b49c6365c4f77ae43be9ab0230cd80f02d,True,False,,,,,0,1653152901,,0,{},i9gwfj5,False,t3_uu5m7q,False,True,t1_i9gt77f,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu5m7q/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_52122/i9gwfj5/,1653152913,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653124101.0,

I agree. It's just impressive to see how stubborn the US is when it comes to buying equipment from other NATO nations. They'll reinvent the wheel if it means not having to buy from other allies. Usually it seems that they only pick to buy non-US equipment when a branch of the Armed Forces is planning to splurge on some boondoggle, and to compensate for that, they opt for cheaper and proven equipment from other NATO countries to cover other pending requirements.

The real question comes later: is Azov a Terrorist Organisation... That's a heated debate but Al Jazeera wrote a good article on it.

&gt; It is led by the National Army. 

As far as I can tell the FSA does not lead the SNC, but rather is the military wing of the SNC, thus the SNC funnels funding to them.

&gt; I am not suggesting this. I am telling you this.

Okay, just be mindful that a lot can be lost in translation here, particularly on Wikipedia. That's why a Wikipedia article on the ""[Syrian opposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_opposition)"" exists, but also an article on the Syrian National Council, even tho according to you they should be synonymous.

Also, your claim of: ""west used to support right of people for self determination..."" applies to peaceful democratic processes. Not instantaneous violent declaration of taking over a portion of the country without the vote of all residents within the affected area. If it involved Ukrainians and only Ukrainians in the east, it would be a civil war or revolutionary war.  


When the neighboring country is involved and firing bullets, then it's just plain war. Look at the Euromaidan protests as an example of the people working as a popular movement to force a change of government. The east has their own protests, but the difference is they called for Russia to support them with violence and Russia obliged. That's when it becomes a war and Ukraine has the right to recapture its own territory. If Russia weren't involved, then it's up to the people in eastern Ukraine to win their independence.  


It's not like any country in the west was formed without winning a war first - whether it's a revolution, civil, or state vs. state war, that's how nations are formed. Look at 1776 vs. the British. The odds of the colonies winning at the beginning of the war and throughout a huge majority of the war itself were horribly against them, but with the effort of the people and some help from the French, they won their territory. Now, if France had not simply supported the revolution, but had also taken the territory and power, then it just becomes a war of the English vs. the French. Just as this has been a war between Ukraine and Russia, and never simply Ukraine versus an independent Donbass fighting without the complicit support of Russia with the end goal of adding to Russia's territory. Even if the name continues to be Donbass in some way, it would still be ""Donbass, Russia.""",e1d0590351d7351f9747530a69b399c813d4778b,True,False,,,,,0,1653135802,,0,{},i9fxsq8,False,t3_utvn6g,False,True,t1_i9fto04,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utvn6g/russian_missile_strike_on_the_house_of_culture_in/i9fxsq8/,1653135817,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653107002.0,

""The Soviet-backed education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. By 1929 over 97% of high school students in the republic were obtaining their education in Ukrainian\[13\] and illiteracy dropped from 47% (1926) to 8% in 1934.\[14\]  
Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized — in both population and education. Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of Kharkiv, at the time the capital of Soviet Ukraine, increased from 38% to 50%. Similar increases occurred in other cities, from 27.1% to 42.1% in Kiev, from 16% to 48% in Dnipropetrovsk, from 16% to 48% in Odessa, and from 7% to 31% in Luhansk.\[14\]  
Similarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and the overall flourishing of Ukrainian cultural life. As of 1931 out of 88 theatres in Ukraine, 66 were Ukrainian, 12 were Jewish (Yiddish) and 9 were Russian. The number of Ukrainian newspapers, which almost did not exist in 1922, had reached 373 out of 426, while only 3 all-republican large newspapers remained Russian. Of 118 magazines, 89 were Ukrainian. Ukrainization of book-publishing reached 83%.\[14\]""  etc.

And as I'm no expert, I may be completely wrong - but I think the question of morale is not that simple. I see the propaganda of painting Russian soldiers as murderers and pillagers is not only to get as much international support as possible, the message is focused on their people as well, especially the ones that enlist in the army. I don't think volunteers in general lack morale that much as a whole - they lack discipline (yes, it is a part of morale, I agree, but just one part).

The message behind the propaganda is, that if you let Russia win, it will be much worse for all those around you, your family, etc. A nation that is united toward one enemy and one goal can have a huge resolve and enthusiasm, which positively affects morale.

We've had a similar situation in our war of independence (Croatia), at the beginning the morale was ok, then it fell, and towards the end, it was as high as ever (especially after news about massacres came out and similar). And keep in mind, we were facing a much stronger foe (especially on paper), without that much international support (we also had a weapons embargo on us from a lot of countries in Europe)

I have a lot of Ukrainian friends that I've been speaking with over the last few months, not that often, but something I've noticed while speaking with them: when the war started they were scared, sad, puzzled why this is happening, confused. They feared the worst. But as the war went on, I could sense a growing resolve - ""this is how it's going to be"", and the rising hate towards Russia. Hate is a super-strong ally to motivation and morale.

Of course, this is completely anecdotal and may not be the case for all of them, especially the ones on the frontlines (have no idea what it's like there). Plus, there may be a big issue with morale at this moment (I really don't know).

I've seen a lot of Russian sources focus on morale of Ukraine's soldiers, that it's really low and falling, which gives me a notion this is something they have a fear of (aside of the international support, of course).

Field radio jammers that block the signals from the controller to the drone. Effective until drones come with frequency hopping radios or anti jammer autonomous attacking, or until a human puts an anti EM Radiation missile like a HARM into the jammer.

Remote weapons stations like CROWS get upgraded with autonomous modes that let them shoot at drones. Like CRAM, but for tanks.

Purpose built gun-based AA like the ZSU-23 make a return to western militaries and get upgraded to detect and engage drones.

Russia is state sponsor of terrorism. It trained DNR terrorists on its land since 2010. It created Wagner neo-nazi PMC and Rusich neo-nazi group with famous sadist (and later war criminal) Milchakov in charge for deniability.

Russia funded martial arts club Oplot in Kharkiv where people received free stuff, free access to training equipment, occasional monetary rewards and high doses of kool-aid. Those tried to blow up my city from inside, later fled to Donbass. Now its known as 5th separate brigade of DNR. And yes, kremlin was funding that terrorist organisation since 2010.

Russia sent Bezler to create a sleeper cell in mid 2000s. He later became one of rather prominent ""rebels"", being de facto naturalised FSB officer. With an organised crime group that miraculously ended up owning APCs and Grad.

Russia sent in Strelkov, shitton of men and a dozen of tanks with him. That dude later gave interview saying it out loud ""It's I who pulled a trigger of Donbass war.""

But if all you need to do is quickly suppress an enemy this is a solid option when you're flying over a manpads infested area. It's cheap, they have a ludicrous stock of these rockets whereas their standoff weaponry is limited having been worn down over months of constant fighting.   


If we were involved in a more or less full engagement/total war scenario, we would be in the same position at this stage. Production of guided and standoff weaponry is both incredibly expensive and comparatively slow compared to the immediately available stocks of dumb rockets and bombs.

Believe it or not, it also used to be an unbiased sub (again, ISIS content would be far and away the most upvoted because it was the best war footage ever). It’s unfortunate we don’t see more of the Russian side, even though it upsets me as well. Things used to be far more about the quality of the footage, not who was getting killed or doing the killing. I’m sure there’s some nostalgia, rose tinted glasses distorting things a bit, but you also used to get former armed service members in every majorly upvoted thread.

Russia is a more powerful force than Ukraine, especially on paper (where they're much more powerful). If they didn't get that much support, the situation on the ground would be quite different. Especially if Russia decided to be more strategic from the start (war-wise) and focus on objectives they can achieve.

The support is definitely a game-changer here. It's the reason why some people are quick to jump to conclusions Ukraine has already won, it's just a matter of time.

I wouldn't avoid giving Ukraine credit though here, their army is much much better compared to 2014 (yes, due to international support), they have the defender's advantage as well, and are a big country (so they can pick and choose where they wish to battle) and are in a state of war (mobilisation, etc. - while Russia has huge issues with this)",2c6c6539256dd30a8349989f385336237236973b,True,False,,,,,0,1653132013,,0,{},i9fseoi,False,t3_uu5m7q,False,True,t1_i9frohm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu5m7q/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_52122/i9fseoi/,1653132023,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653103213.0,

3506,[],False,,jamison8884,,,[],,,,text,t2_7sbaz,False,False,"You're asking me if Russia has the munitions to waste shells on civilian structures? That's part of their entire military doctrine. Look at every single city and village they've captured and occupied. It's absolutely destroyed with up to 95% of structures being total losses. Mariupol is not an isolated case; go look at Kharkiv and then the next five largest cities in northeastern and eastern Ukraine.  


Then go look at both Chechen wars - same deal. Shell the shit out of all towns and cities until they're dead or surrender. I shouldn't have to point this out or explain it when there are literally pictures and videos of cruise missiles, rockets, and artillery rounds hitting apartment buildings in Odessa.  


Also, remember all of the Kyiv suburbs with bodies all over the streets with single gunshot wounds described as ""execution"" style? The first Russian charged with war crimes pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old in the head. That definitely increases the odds of the hundreds of others found dead in the streets suffering a similar fate are unlikely to be a coincidence.  


Finally, Iraq and WMDs? That's absolutely on US leadership either lying or simply being guilty of criminal negligence and the blood of so many innocent people is on their conscious. Blaming the public when war was executed without their direct approval or full intelligence information? That's not on the US public, just as this war isn't on the Russian public.  


However, once the people learn the truth of the matter, that there are no WMDs and no Nazis, respectively, and if they choose to support the invasion and war still? That's when it's on those particular people. As soon as it became clear Iraq was a mistake, I wanted nothing to do with the US in Iraq, period.  


For Afghanistan, I was too young to understand the mechanics of an insurgency-based war. The proper way to handle that was to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam and recognize the fact you're not doing much of anything unless the given insurgency has only a tiny amount of support and the rest of the population actively wants a change to the type of society you're attempting to give them. The game plan should have been to destroy the Taliban's infrastructure, resources, and leadership, and then use drones and special forces to hunt Bin Laden without limiting it to Afghanistan alone. Once he was taken out, leave Afghanistan to their people and have all coalition military leave, and continue to manage the threat of global terrorism just as we are today, with intelligence assets and special forces as needed. But, hindsight is a wonderful thing.  


The reason for the military presence was justified due to global terrorism (9/11 was not the only attack in the US or internationally, it was the wakeup call), and don't even try to compare it to the Russian invasion. Does Russia have an alliance of dozens of international partners willing to contribute support and a coalition army of soldiers to fight for their cause in Ukraine? It's precisely the opposite, where 90% plus of countries are telling Russia to get the fuck out as they shouldn't make up some bullshit to invade a sovereign democracy. I'd like to hear the Russian people's reaction if they were told the leader of Israel called Putin directly and told him there is no specific threat of Nazis in Ukraine; what's next, Putin telling the world he's more qualified to judge who's a Nazi more so than the ethnic victims of the Holocaust?",41a4316c63ce91ad2f02357d9cde8eed9ceabdee,True,False,,,,,0,1653127488,,0,{},i9fn3si,False,t3_umf2pv,False,True,t1_i9eu9ee,/r/CombatFootage/comments/umf2pv/an_ah64_apache_decimates_a_platoon_sized_element/i9fn3si/,1653127504,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653098688.0,

Forget about justifing an invasion, but Ukraine made the wrong choice. It does not matter if it is good or bad, there is the wise and dumb choice. It is politics and strategies. Minsk meant Donbas autonomy within Ukraine. That for sure would be way way way better for Ukraine than this war. Some like that Russians bleed in Ukraine. That is fine, problem is that Ukraine bleeds too. Also whole of Europe suffers.
I do not know the real reasons for Russian invasion, nobody really does, maybe Putin, bit we can not count on him comming out honestly. Putin was a KGB agent, not an Russian zealot. Idea of Russian empire restoration is a bit funny. For sure he wants a security belt around Russia, this Russian empire pretex is a good justification for his domestic use.

The risk from .50 cal or autocannons will pretty much always exist simply due to how numerous they are relative to specific anti-air weapons like SAMs and MANPADS, and the fact they can be reasonably accurate if you see the helicopter approaching up to about 2 km high. Some videos from Ukraine show just how fast those autocannon rounds are, so a low to medium flying helicopter can get chewed up. However, in Ukraine, they're still flying low to avoid MANPADS and other SAM systems as their primary threat given the flat terrain.  


So, short answer: I'd rather fly low to medium elevation within the valley (even in a slightly random horizontal and vertical flight path) and take my chances that any heavy ground fire isn't prepared to fire at a fast-moving target with only a few seconds to prepare to fire, versus flying high and any SAM or MANPADS within a \~5 km moving radius being able to hit me at nearly guaranteed odds with zero warning besides seeing a smoke trail.",6db483d75c97e931de2c81205e8c4e489bc6af7d,True,False,,,,,0,1653125809,,0,{},i9flap0,False,t3_usk3ml,False,True,t1_i95sx25,/r/CombatFootage/comments/usk3ml/saudi_ah64d_apache_show_down_by_yemeni_forces_29/i9flap0/,1653125825,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653097009.0,

Russians wouldn't be able to encircle all Ukrainian forces in Luhansk. They currently aim to encircle 2 cities. Unless you assume that Ukraine holds most of their army there, Russians can at most encircle a few brigades. 

Ukrainian army has been fighting for 3 months, they have plenty of experiences soldiers. Losing a few thousand won't change the situation much.

Russian forces simply don't have enough strength to capitalise on the Luhansk success. Russian manpower is still low, they are exhausting themselves against the staunch Ukrainian defenses.

The main problem with what Russia is trying to do now is the lack of a strategic goal. Even if they manage to encircle and capture these 2 cities, what then? This won't capitulate Ukraine, won't destroy the UAF, won't even stop the training of new troops and the flow of weapons. This is hauntingly similar to Wehrmacht struggle against the USSR after 1942.

A friend tells me the Ukrainian army does not use the kind of grenade used to booby-trap the area.

Watching the footage again, I noticed the first grenade has the safety pin ring ready to be snatched away by hitting the wire, but the striker is taped in place - though I'm not really sure that would actually make the grenade useless.

The second one is taped differently, in a way that would make more sense to me.

Just UA said they did, pat themselves on the back and moved on. The current assumption is that the ship was not hit and it was just a lie. Infact that ship is the new flagship of black feet (announced yesterday). You don't make a ship hit with an ASM flagship.",84d45801a2b2387ba1151985c47f63a7ac305ab1,True,False,,,,,0,1653122032,,0,{},i9fh9u2,False,t3_uu4wjt,False,True,t1_i9ffmpt,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu4wjt/mariupol_azovstal_fight_near_the_tunnel/i9fh9u2/,1653122047,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653093232.0,

This dude takes statements of russkie nutjobs as facts. I mean, just check out this source he uses [https://twitter.com/Russ\_Warrior](https://twitter.com/Russ_Warrior)  It's kremlin propaganda bingo interleaved with other accounts like that!

And some of features on map are really crazy. Like that UAF salient towards Zhelobok: it was abandoned months ago.

Lisichansk/Severodonetsk wont be easy to encircle: UAF hold river to the north and while Popasna breakthrough is real it's nowhere close to what happened to Mariupol.

Mariupol got deep behind lines pretty quick as invaders still kept mobility. Now they move at the slime's pace and in worst case there will be a pullout.

That is not justification for invading a sovereign country, fuck off with that bullshit.

&gt;They say that Russia was forced to attack now because Ukraine was opening a door for NATO and was preping an assault on LPR/DNR

Part A of that is bullshit - everyone knew that under NATO rules Ukraine would never make it in - and even if it was true it's not fucking justification to invade anyway, there are already multiple NATO countries bordering Russia and bordering Russia is not justification for invading anyway.  

Part B is irrelevant as it does not give Russia the right to militarily intervene and especially not invade.

Get your apologism out of here. You are defending a murderer who is causing death and destruction on a countrywide scale. You want to know the real reason for the invasion? Read Putin's own words about Ukraine where he denies its existence as a nation. He wrote an entire fucking essay justifying his theft of Ukrainian land for his own legacy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Historical_Unity_of_Russians_and_Ukrainians

It very much does, any group that wants the Syrian government gone is considered part of the opposition, that's what defines them as opposition.

Mind you; That does not mean they share the same ideas about what should follow *after* the government is gone, but they very much share the same enemy, the Syrian government.

&gt; it is an umbrella term including groups that are neither a part of the SDF nor Jihadist Terrorists

It's an umbrella term for groups wanting to overthrow the government, being jihadi or not has absolutely nothing to do with it, that's just extremely outdated ""moderate rebel"" US propaganda.

&gt; Most of the Syrian Opposition is actually anti-ISIS AFAIK and have engaged in battles with them.

Very difficult to generalize like that due to the sheer number of different groups and their local spin-offs, particularly as depending on the given strategic situation some groups end up working together, against a common enemy, that would otherwise never work together. If you want a concrete example of that, just look a bit into the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army.

Generally considered Islamist, it at times has [worked together with secular rebels in fighting AQ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303870704579298851707261542) but also has worked together with AQ off-shoots [like Al Nusra](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/08/al_nusrah_front_conducts_joint.php#ixzz22kEQgPB9). 

Or to give another example; The Syrian Kurds have been one of the most effective forces in fighting ISIS on the ground, yet they are not actually that active in the civil war itself.

With Popasna there is certainly an element of the fog of war, where the outcomes have been blurry possibly due to changing conditions on the ground. However, there is universal agreement that what happens in Donbas is crucial even though we don't know exactly what happened where.

In contrast, there isn't any debate the Staryi Saltiv is under Ukrainian control. The Russians said three weeks ago that it was with the Ukrainians now; some officer said something to the effect of ""Yeah, we had about 10 guys there and they left before the Ukrainians came."" What is unclear (at least to some people) is how it might be important. It really doesn't seem plausible that it is important, but people (esp. on Reddit, perhaps Ukraine a little bit) keep on reminding us about the recapture of Staryi Saltiv.

As for Donetsk, yes Ru has had stalled breakthroughs, but i believe this one to be different. 7 miles in a day, 3 pronged attack with some video evidence of a significant reinforcements backing them up. Not only that but the tactical position of this break through is much more advantageous than any before. The Uk forces in the Zolot area need to withdraw like tonight or they will be encircled. A prong is heading towards Severodonetsk, which is already encircled on three sides (part of those insignificant gains the media was talking about in the past few weeks). This breakthrough is striking at the logistical hubs and routes of everything to the east. Reports of RU troops only a few km from Soledar. Who knows what will happen. But I think what is happening right now as we speak is the most significant breakthrough in eastern Ukraine since RU pivoted it’s war effort to the East.

Sure, I never said anything different. It’s also irrelevant to the point I was making, as our logistical success was a failure in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. 

&gt;	would have had a SIGNIFICANT distinct tactical advantage over the 2014 UAF 

Sure, but again I never said anything different. But tactics are not the point of war. You can still win the tactical fight and lose *terribly.* As in Vietnam etc, a nation can dominate tactically and lose the war abjectly. This focus on tactics is myopic. 

&gt;	I doubt, a Pro-Russia, Russian backed UAF would put up this much fight against the US Military.

Again, I never said anything different. Notice a pattern?

&gt;	the US would probably have over half the country under control right now.

Nominal control? Perhaps. Actual control? Sure, like in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

&gt;	we have a MASSIVE array of technology 

I know. Its come up once or twice in brigade level planning meetings at work. My point is that despite all the logistics and all the tech we focus on, the only way for us to defeat these same people, with this same determination, would be the same way Russia can. Genocide. Not through any tactical successes. 

&gt;	I don’t think we’d be 3 months into the conflict and only taken 15% of the country.

Perhaps. But then we would likely bungle the entire op, alienate the people more everyday and walk away with a fat LOSS in the history books after a decade. Don’t confuse seizure of land with victory. 

&gt;	“rolled over a third world country” moment like Afghanistan was. 

We rolled over Afghanistan? We supported the people of the Northern Alliance in defeating the Taliban. We had ~100 troopers in the victory. Then we proceeded to screw it all up and lose dramatically. 

&gt;	We have dedicated weapons and tactics, 

Yup. You list issues of tactics, tactics, tactics. Let’s talk about winning wars not fighting them. All sorts of people can fight but not all win. Let’s focus on the point. Winning, winning, winning. The tactics and equipment are meaningless without victory and the two don’t often correlate for the US. 

&gt;	In 6 months, 3 weeks and 5 days, the coalition forces killed 20-50k troops, injured 75k+, captured upwards of 175k, destroyed 3,300 tanks, 2100 APC’s, and 2200 artillery pieces.  Of their air force, 110 aircraft were destroyed.

And none of it mattered in the end did it? We still lost *badly.*

But breakthroughs in and of themselves are not decisive if they have to do it again in the next urban complex, village, or line of bunkers.

Nazis don't stop being Nazis and Ukraine has committed plenty of its own war crimes during the Donbas war -   


&gt;Dutch journalist Chris Caspar de Ploeg in his book ""Ukraine in the Crossfire"" emphasises that in many cases a military activity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces constitutes war crimes. Based on information provided by OSCE, UN, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch he demonstrates that the Ukrainian Army is using heavy military equipment for shelling of residential areas including educational and medical facilities. In addition to this The New York Times, Human Rights Watch, and the OSCE independently documented the use of cluster munitions by the regular Ukrainian army. This kind of weapon was banned by 118 countries due to its inability to discriminate between civilian and military targets.\[113\]

Ukraine certainly has a far-right / nationalism problem with plenty of idolization of former Nazi Collaborators such as [Stepan Bandera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Bandera):  [https://marktaliano.net/nazi-collaborator-monuments-in-ukraine-by-lev-golinkin/](https://marktaliano.net/nazi-collaborator-monuments-in-ukraine-by-lev-golinkin/)  


Nazis are a loaded term though and it's not like Russia doesn't have their own nationalism problem, although comparing the number of Nazis is like comparing shit sandwiches. Fascists are usually the first to be sent into wars because they are the most expendable.  


The important thing to remember about this war, is that it's a proxy war between the US and Russia and has been raging since 2014 after the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych in the Euromaidan riots. It's up to you to decide what was behind those riots: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOBntnuYCMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOBntnuYCMA)  


If you know the history of US intervention in the region via Joe Biden (as a senator), and John Kerry, and paid attention to what was going on during the Trump administration with Victoria Nuland and the whole ""Fuck the EU Tapes"", etc... and then the Trump impeachment stuff, the IMF loaning out money to Ukraine and the loan renewal situation prior to Euromaidan in 2013, and know the history of the US intervening in developing nations, it's not hard to figure out what is really going in here. I'll leave you to your own conclusions.

If the Germans produced the StG-44 in 1939 (*it would be called the StG 39 then*) and the majority of infantrymen carried it instead of the Kar98, the war would’ve been a lot different. The Nazis still would’ve lost but I bet they would’ve lasted a little longer. There are a lot of ‘what if’s’ in WWII. What if the Nazis were the first to create an atom bomb or what if they had the V2 rocket from the start of the war. What if they won the battle for Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad. Etc etc. It’s interesting to think about what the world would be like today if the Nazis won the war. At least in Europe, they would have never been able to cross the Atlantic and conquer North America. Lucky for us Nazis couldn’t resist being Nazis. They murdered and alienated some of their brightest scientists simply because they were Jewish.

I think the US Military would stand a fair better chance of meeting the basic needs of its own soldiers in this war and would have had a SIGNIFICANT distinct tactical advantage over the 2014 UAF (assuming we didn't immediately start training the now pro-west UAF and supplying them to fight Russia).  I doubt, a Pro-Russia, Russian backed UAF would put up this much fight against the US Military.  


I genuinely don't think people understand the difference.  There is only one military power on this planet capable of projecting an entire nation's military across oceans, with logistics.  If Poland gave a base of operations to start the conflict, the US would probably have over half the country under control right now.   


I don't say that lightly... we have a MASSIVE array of technology to monitor troop movements, signal intelligence, and jamming capabilities.  We have dedicated weapons and tactics, which have evolved to the changing RU/Soviet Bloc SAM sites, and the best SEAD/DEAD (anti-SAM) air forces in the world.  Our artillery is very good, and our ground troops frighteningly efficient in urban combat and mountainous combat (see Iraq/Afghan wars).  We can fight in the night, reliably, without issue.  Our tank forces are solid and well supported with logistics.  


Don't get me wrong, we'd take losses, but I don't think we'd be 3 months into the conflict and only taken 15% of the country.    


And for what it is worth, the Gulf War, against Iraq, isn't exactly a ""rolled over a third world country"" moment like Afghanistan was.  The Iraqi military was 650k strong.  In 6 months, 3 weeks and 5 days, the coalition forces killed 20-50k troops, injured 75k+, captured upwards of 175k, destroyed 3,300 tanks, 2100 APC's, and 2200 artillery pieces.  Of their air force, 110 aircraft were destroyed.  

What did coalition forces lose?  \~300 KIA, 800 wounded, 31 tanks, 30 APC's, 1 artillery piece, and 75 aircraft.  All of that took place before the US SIGINT core and satellite core were working full time... before stealth, before combined arms tactics, before Navy and USAF air battle management coalesced, before widespread use of NVG's, optics, lasers, BLUFORCE tracking, MRAPS, TUSK kits for tanks and most modern ATGM's.

Basically, you find the location, mark it with your fire computer. The fire computer then automatically tells you where you need to pitch up to, and where to aim the reticle. Then you do your fire run, pitch up, and dump the rockets when the X is on the target. 

Their results were basically, it's moderately accurate, to fairly accurate and it depends highly on the pilots individual skill. A good pilot with high skill will keep the reticle on the target while pitching the nose up, and this will deliver a pattern that more closely resembles a circle on the target.

The problem for Russia is, this isn't Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan. Where none of those countries/forces had access to large numbers of manpads. Some groups in Syria had some manpads, but manpads in the UA are ubiquitous at this point.

So, yes, while this is a relatively inefficient method of delivery. If the pilot is skilled, and the target is known, it is still going to delivery relatively accurate, and therefore lethal fire on target to anyone who is not in hard cover. 

Also, if you have the rockets, you might as well utilize them in a manner that doesn't get the platform designed to fire them shot down needlessly. A KA-52 that makes a direct fire run on a Ukrainian position that gets shot down, might deliver a more accurate and lethal barrage.

This Russian propaganda affects some people to such extent that they are convincing me, a Russian-speaking citizen of Ukraine that we are being genocided here by nazis. Even though Azov members speak Russian in half of the videos we see in this sub. 

My nephew is half Jewish by the way. Why I support a group that wants her murdered? What do you think? 

The answer to the whole controversy is that for us in Ukraine all this nazi and commie symbolics is more style and history than the idea.
I presented Hitler's Mein Kampf to my colleague as a joke and people laughed. I would've been fired if I did this in the West. When my 90-year old grandma heard this story she asked for a copy to see if that book was any good. And mind this, she lived through nazi occupation as a child and saw people murdered by them in her village. 

We are not politically correct here. So people really do wear nazi totenkopfs because they look cool. It's similar to how Chinese view it. There are Hitler-theme cafes there. And no one is offended. It's just memorable for visitors.
