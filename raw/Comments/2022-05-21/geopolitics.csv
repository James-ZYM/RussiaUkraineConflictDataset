[],False,,Statistats,,,[],,,,text,t2_yqwgd,False,False,"&gt; Turkey’s continued occupation of Northern Cyprus is a global outrage. While a dormant conflict in terms of violence, it’s a clear display of Turkey’s contempt for international norms of national self determination, and a clear contradiction when considering how steadfast the Turkish government is in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, where it uses its supposed prioritization of sovereignty despite a 99% Armenian majority region wanting to leave Azerbaijan.

And how did it become 99% Armenian majority? It's funny how you complain about Turkey's occupation of Northern Cyprus while ignoring the fact that the Armenians occupied parts of Azerbaijan for about 30 years until the recent war. 

You have the [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast](https://karabakh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nagorno-karabakh.gif) which was a gerrymandered region created by USSR to include as many Armenians as possibly, which is why the borders look so weird. Then you have the [Republic of Artsakh](https://www.nationsonline.org/maps/Armenia-Political-Map.jpg), which was created after the first war and included occupied Azerbaijani lands.

According to the 1989 census [1] (just before the war) of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast that region was 76.9% (145.450) Armenian. The Armenian-occupied areas surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was according to the 1979 census [2] (the 1989 census didn't report the population per region) 97.9% (363.588) Azerbaijani.

If we assume that the Azerbaijanis didn't increase in number between 1979 and 1989 then in 1989 the population of what was to become Republic of Artsakh was 26.6% (146.855) Armenian and 73.4% (404.276) Azerbaijani. In 2005 it was 99.7% Armenian.

So not only did they occupy an area twice the size of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast but they also ethnically cleansed the Azerbaijani population about 3 times the size of the Armenian population in that area. Compared to the Cyprus conflict it would be like the 20% Turkish population took the whole island instead of 36% of it and kicked all the Greeks out.

This point from your list of things isn't the only one lacking historical insight and any nuance, but it's the most ridiculous one so it's the only one I'll answer.

Lula’s announcement of plans for SUR, a new Latin American currency for bilateral trade, has excited proponents of regional integration, and will alarm Washington. The project, if successful, would mean twilight for US dollar hegemony, and it has clear implications for the 2022 election.

Less than six months ahead of Brazil’s most crucial elections since the 1980s, the former president and current frontrunner, Workers’ Party candidate, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has announced a plan for the creation of a single currency as part of a wider expansion of regional relations.

Lula, who maintains a double digit lead in polls for likely runoff against far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, told gathered militants at the electoral congress of coalition allies PSOL that Brazil, and Latin America as whole, don’t have to “depend on the dollar”.

Although not a brand new idea, the latest move toward ​​a single Latin American currency has been advanced by the economist Gabriel Galípolo, former president of Banco Fator, who has collaborated on the Lula government program. In a recent article published in the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, signed by the economist and the former mayor of São Paulo, Fernando Haddad, both promote its implementation, in a model similar to the European euro, as a way to increase regional integration and strengthen the monetary sovereignty of the region.

Lula revealed that the currency would be called the SUR (“South” in Spanish), and has committed to ratifying the project if is elected president: “We are going to restore our relationship with Latin America. And God willing, we will create a currency in Latin America,” he told the event.

The former president stressed that it was not intended as a replacement for sovereign domestic currencies in Latin America, but that they could use SUR for bilateral trade rather than US dollars, and argued that it could be a useful tool to contain inflation, which is at its highest levels since the 1990s in Brazil.

Lula explained that the overall goal of SUR would be to deepen Latin American integration and strengthen the region’s economic sovereignty, reducing dependence on the United States.",c55e4869d89c987efb9912e79310f784fd077aed,True,False,,,,,0,1653177356,,0,{},i9i9f7t,True,t3_uuz4b5,False,True,t3_uuz4b5,/r/geopolitics/comments/uuz4b5/sur_lula_proposes_latin_american_currency_to_end/i9i9f7t/,1653177371,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653148556.0,

[],False,,PRTK24,,,[],,,,text,t2_3tm11vpt,False,False,"You have formed opinions based on assumptions. Let me point some out.

1. Putin didn't inform the indian establishment about war. His own troops didn't know that they were actually going to war. Only a small circle of his trusted politicians and bureaucrats knew about it. He had been doing his sabre rattling since 2014. There is no way indian leadership could have predicted that he was actually gonna invade. Also, the fact that you think putin would listen to them is just an assumption.
2. Arms purchases - Indian military isn't having second thoughts about russian equipment. They will continue to buy stuff they think is good, like - S-400, Nuclear Subs, etc. Russian military losses have more to do with their tactics and not the equipment itself. That's just mindless internet propaganda. Nothing is black and white. Some russian stuff is horrible, some is pretty good. Like T-90, everyone in indian military circles knew that it had horrible crew safety but a lot of other factors made them buy it. OFB, uralvagonzavod, late 1990s, a complete history can be written about it but that would make this post very long. Also, Indian political leadership wanted military to stop buying russian stuff and go for domestic stuff long before this war. This war just made them screw the bolts tighter.
3. I'm not sure which indian nationalists you are hanging around with, but the most I have seen, seem to agree that putin committed a blunder. Its not about historical narratives either, its about power. Putin wanted to secure territory to increase the strategic landmass and reduce their exposure in european plains. He went about it using pedantic propaganda which atleast had a credible facade. He banked on the absolute might of his armed forces to achieve his gains and get away with it (just like other powerful countries; like US invading iraq and setting a precedent). Which is absolutely real in this world. The powerful do as they want and the weak must suffer as they must. His only problem - He didn't have numerous blind allies like US and his army was not properly trained and rotten with corruption. Now, I am not sure where this India/Pak dichotomy came from. Nobody here wants more pakistani landmass because with that landmass will come a lot of illiterate masses whose religious tendencies is something most indians will be uncomfortable with. Indians are happy with status quo.
4. ""indian supremacy coolaid"" ""crops"". Most indian nationalists tend to be ultra-realists. Sure, ambitious but still rooted in reality. I'm talking about people with faces like strategic thinkers not faceless internet trolls. Which why indian nationalists mercilessly criticize military(army especially) for their love of russian/foreign weapons. I am not sure what indian establishment would have done about heat waves either. They have restricted exports to prevent hoarding by private entities, which is good, as it will allow the govt to directly intervene in as to who gets the grains (vulnerable poor income countries). Will prevent disaster-profiteers from coming into action. Anecdote - Indian leadership personally asked some individual African countries if they needed any help with PPEs/vaccines/medicines before delta outbreak crippled india, which proved useful as then they helped India in its time of need.",b11fd6b4aeda36926fc1620ecb88ca415fa63a5d,True,False,,,,,0,1653176018,,0,{},i9i704a,False,t3_uup1d7,False,True,t1_i9heba1,/r/geopolitics/comments/uup1d7/indian_geopolitics_was_correct_developing_world/i9i704a/,1653176035,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653147218.0,

A lot of this is just talk.  You can see in the link from Bloomberg that as of a couple of weeks ago, many companies in the EU have opened accounts with Gazprom as per Russia's request.  Many EU governments are talking tough but have no problem with this arrangement.

I see a lot of people in here disappointed about this.  I'm not sure that some fully understand the consequences.

If gas prices increase 200-300%, low-margin industrial operations are in danger of going out of business.  There is not enough LNG ports or alternative pipelines to fulfill the EU demand for energy if they don't buy Russian gas.

So people in here lamenting these developments, I would like to ask you: would you prefer to see thousands of people in the EU laid off?  Would you prefer to see millions of ordinary people unable to afford their heating bills?  Because that would be the effects of refusing to work around the Russian sanctions.

It's pretty clear that the whole sanctions regime was poorly thought out and a knee-jerk reaction by the EU in response to extraordinary pressure from the US.  The massive recovery in the Russian ruble since the beginning of the war and the coincident cratering of the Euro is a direct effect of these policies towards Russia.

Stopping the flow of Russian gas is not in the interests of the average citizen in the EU.  And to act as if the EU halting gas purchases would lead to an immediate collapse of Russia's military operation... you're living in a fantasy.  Russia can still sell gas and oil to India and China freely, countries which, combined, are more than 4-5x the size of the EU by population and matches it by GDP.

This policy hurts citizens of the EU, not Russia.

To preface, it goes without saying that Russia has been conducting its war in Ukraine in a much more brutal way than America ever would, and that human life holds much less value for decision-makers in Moscow than it does for those in Washington. However, from the perspective of the many people in the world in Russia (and China, India, a lot of the Middle East, etc.) who view the US very critically/skeptically, we have given them no shortage of reasons to view us as the biggest hypocrite in the world. 

We unilaterally invaded Iraq on a false basis, invaded and occupied Afghanistan for some 20 years, and intervened in Libya and Syria, plunging both countries into horrible civil wars. At the same time we criticize other countries about their human rights record, we continue to support and sell weapons to authoritarian countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia who freely torture and imprison people. We denounce Russia for its war crimes in Ukraine, while at the same time showing 0 accountability or remorse for the hundreds of thousands of civilians killed indirectly as a result of American activity in the Middle East, and the thousands killed directly as a result of American war crimes (i.e. air strikes on weddings and hospitals, mistaking civilians for combatants) for which nobody important will get punished. Just a few months ago, you had an entire family in Kabul get killed by an American missile strike because we mistakenly thought one of them was planning a suicide bombing. At worst, someone might have gotten demoted or reprimanded for that, but if it hadn't gotten a lot of press coverage, nobody would have said a thing.

Russia started an aggressive, illegal war on a flimsy pretext, and America and our allies do have the right to punish and sanction them for it. That being said, when you have America of all countries denouncing Russian war crimes (many of which are identical to ones we committed in the Middle East), or threatening to seize Russian funds stored in US banks (which would basically be destroying all the norms that the international finance system is based on), it becomes very obvious that America has its own set of rules for judging what is good and bad based completely on its own national interest.

Scenario #1: Germany converts EUR into USD (sells EUR and buys USD) and pays Gazprom in USD. Gazprom then converts those dollars into RUB (buys RUB and sells USD) and pays local wages, etc. accordingly. 

Scenario #2: Germany converts EUR into RUB (sells EUR and buys RUB) and pays Gazprom who then pays local wages, etc. accordingly. 

What’s the difference? I guess the dollar market is mildly (in the grand scheme of things) less liquid, but the number of EUR sold and RUB bought is static in both scenarios. FX rates should be largely unimpacted. Only the timing and parties making the conversion change. 

My working theory is that the timing is likely immaterial, but the people involved in the FX are shy Russians care. My guess is that it’s an opportunity for oligarchs to siphon off some of the payment, which is a way for Putin to secure/strengthen his power base amongst those who actually call the shots in Russia.

[],False,,GrAdmThrwn,,,[],,,,text,t2_v46ip,False,False,"The second major shift in the Russian perspective on their post-Cold War 'partnership' with the US and the West, occured when the US invaded Iraq in 2003. This was done without UN mandate, and far more importantly to the Russian's, without the support of the UN Security Council. To the Russian leadership, this was a concerning development that signalled that one aspect of the new geopolitical order brought about by the fall of the Soviet Union was the diminishing of credibility of the Security Council. What point is there to the veto held by members of the P5, when the worlds sole surviving superpower could simply ignore the UN if it deems unilateral action to be necessary to achieving their strategic goals? Effectively, this confirmed the precedent set by the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia and changed the Russian perspective of that action from an unfortunate abberation to an established norm of the new US led international order.

Once again, this was not necessarily a deal breaker for cooperation between Russia and the US. Despite the danger posed by unilateral action aimed at regime change and the enlargement of NATO yet again in 2004, the Russian leadership likely felt *more* secure due to the increased US focus on the Middle East and the general lack of actual teeth behind the 2004 NATO enlargement, especially at a time when the US was focused on Iraq and Afghanistan. 

If you were to ask a Russian security planner in 2004 whether the US would be focused on security in Eastern Europe in coming years, they would likely be confused. If anything, the general concern was that the War on Terror would expand to Iran, Syria or Libya and end up being a general long-term Western embroilment in North Africa and the Middle East. 

The fact that additional conflict sites were likely to emerge in Asia and the Western Pacific, that are far more critical to the US economy and strategic interests, made it even less likely that the West and Russia would be having a show down over the balance of power in Eastern Europe any time soon.

This leads us to the third major shift. That is 2007-2008, where NATO gave weight to the notion that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members. This was in conjunction with a number of issues that concerned the Russians, in particular the anti-balistic missile shield that the US had initially intended to set up in Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as the general strengthening of NATO's eastern security architecture, the weakness and negligence of which was a large factor in Russia's prior (relative) lack of concern for the 2004 NATO enlargement. The Russian leadership voiced their concerns most notably in Putin's 2008 speech in Munich, and the conflict between Russia and Georgia over Akhbazia and Ossetia in 2008 was a very loud message to this effect. 

The aftermath of these events in 2008 has led to a steady collapse of positive bilateral relations between Russia and the US that has negatively affected the opinions of the Russian populace towards the US leadership. While there were brief periods of thawing in the relationship, we can see the period between 2008 and 2014 as being marked by the US and Russia butting heads over Georgia, Libya, Syria, Iran and finally, in 2014, Ukraine. 

The fourth shift is, of course, the events of 2014 in Ukraine. Ukraine represents a clear red-line in Russian foreign policy planning. I would say that, as bad as things appeared after the third shift in 2008, it was nothing compared to the change of power in Ukraine in 2014 and subsequent discussions to include the Ukraine in NATO and the EU. In fact, I would argue that since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and, yes, even *Russians* has never been as distrustful of foreign policy leaders in the West as they were post 2014. 

Ultimately, you can really view the Russian perspective through a lense of a steady shift from optimism (early 90s), loss of trust (mid 90s), disappointment (late 90s), disgruntled contentment (early 2000s), concern (late 2000s), alarm (early 2010s). 

I'm not sure what to call the Russian perspective in the late 2010s because I would guess that the events in Ukraine in 2014 was a very alarming surprise to them and their foreign policy decision makers have been operating from a state of shock since then. The decision to seize Crimea and fuel the conflict in Donbass seems to be a kneejerk, time-saving decision more than anything else, eliminating the risk of Ukraine being rapidly absorbed into NATO and ensuring that Sevastopol remains under Russian control. 

The current events taking place in Ukraine is an entirely different beast altogether, but its ongoing and we really cannot say what the outcome will be for the purposes of determining the Russian perspective towards the US/the West.

*cracks knuckles*

The Russian people and the Russian leadership's perspectives and attitudes towards the West went through several major shifts since 1991. 

At first, between 1991 and 1996, the leadership and the people had a great deal of optimism and generally viewed the west in a positive light, as potential allies and part of the same bloc (eventually). 

I would actually argue that the people began to view the west, or at least capitalism and democracy, with a great deal more skepticism *before* the Russian leadership did. This is due to the utter failure of economic shock therapy and the ensuing chaos of the 90s.

The first segment of the Russian leadership that began to break with the new pro-western lean of the Russian government was the Intelligentsia and the Military. Predictably, they were suspicious of the shift of emphasis from Partnership for Peace to preserving and strengthening NATO and they strongly opposed its expansion in 1997.

I would define the first shift in perspective of the Russian leadership and people towards the West and in particular, towards US foreign policy makers as the loss of trust in and optimism for the post-Cold War order. 

The post-Soviet loss of order, stability and living standards lost the trust of the Russian people, while the collapse of the post-WW2 security balance in Europe (from Moscow's perspective) that the USSR had established, resulted in a shift in perspective in the Russian leadership. 

This was brought into sharp relief with NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia, which more or less confirmed the danger that NATO continued to pose to the security balance of Europe (again, from the Russian perspective).

When Putin came to power, there was a brief respite due to a restoration of general stability. This stability was due to a number of factors, but the three primary contributors are the return of basic societal order due to rising oil and gas prices, the new leadership in the Kremlin bringing a large number of the oligarchs to heel (and ensuring the rest were invested in the regime), and the strengthening of the state security arm, which led to the restoration of Russian rule in Chechnya and a general crackdown on foreign interference/influence in Russian internal affairs. 

While the 90s and the first tranche of NATO's expansion had damaged the trust between Russia and the US, the reality in the early 2000s, was that no one was really interested in returning to the status quo of the Cold War. This is why the relationship between Russia and the US continued to be cooperative, especially during the initial stages of the War on Terror. 

The Russian perspective on this new shift in US foreign policy is complex, but generally the Russian's were highly concerned with radicalised islamic elements due to their history with the Caucasus and they were more or less fairly enthusiastic about the US focusing on this issue as well as removing much of their focus from Europe. For the Russian's, this was a win-win and they even assisted the US operation in Afghanistan, offering logistics support through the use of Russian military bases in central Asia.

On paper it may seem that an invasion on Taiwan would be easier than the invasion on Ukraine, China is significantly more militarized than Russia, has a way larger military and a way larger economy. But a few important details show that a potential invasion would be a Sisyphusian task even by China.

1. Geographically Taiwan is littered with mountain ranges that could be fortified and littered with artillery and anti air batteries. There are also only a handful of beaches that allow a signifant landing force, said beaches are easily targettable by artillery fire.
2. Due to consistent weather patterns, the only viable months for an amphibious invasion are April and October, any other time period would have Strongwinds, Rough waves, heavy fog or be in Typhoon season.
3. Occupying a densely populated island of 23million people is insanely difficult and would be met with extreme resistance considering one of Taiwans national unifying cry is preparing for an eventual Chinese invasion and occupation.
4. The status quo of Taiwan is more beneficial to China. China for decades has consistently called for reunification as an easy nationalist rallying cry they can easily tap. A break of the status quo would be a loss for China. Worries and panic of a Chinese invasion is also a very Anglosphere thing, internet searches  in Cantonese and Mandarin about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has been consistent for the past 2 decades.

I think the problem the average person in the west has with Turkey is their their leadership, or at least the image that is portrayed. Erdogan just seems like a bully, and although he has some successes as you've pointed out, he also has a lot of controversies.   


Here in the US we don't hear much about Turkey except when there is something controversial like Turkey purchasing Russian air defense systems and then complaining when the US wont sell them F-35s. Or when Erdogan sends his own staff around the world to kidnap dissidents and even attacking people in the US. Or how inflation is out of control and Erdogan seems unable or unwilling to do anything about it.  


Personally its just a strange dichotomy that I have trouble understanding. The Turkish people seem so kind and intelligent, but then they turn around and keep supporting a man who is obviously enriching himself while their economy crumbles and seems to be blatantly eroding rights and building himself a comfortable authoritarian regime.

Add to that the awful 1990 decade for the average russian, the loss of social protection, the pillage of their state based economy, etc... leading to the formation of the oligarch caste. All that by a political clique heavily supported by the west (and largely advised by people from the Chicago school). 

So, of course, there's a whole generation who certainly resent the west, and celebrate Putin as the one who finally ended this era, bringing back some wellfare to russians and daring to oppose the powers of Eltsine era oligarchs (if in fact he only opposed those like Khodorkovsky, suspected to have political ambitions threatening the power of his own tribe, the silotviki, intelligence/military personnel having become oligarchs too, but those are supposed -or presented by the propaganda as- to have Russian interests in mind, instead of being only about selling them for money).   

Now it's only one generation, remaining obsessed by the fall of USSR era, and the 90s nightmare. Putin's support is certainly far smaller among russian youths (and even middle aged people now), and especially the westernized urban ones. 

And it also doesn't mean that all this generation lament for the loss of the empire in the extent Putin himself does. If there's a vocal minority obsessed with imperial nostalgia, like in any other society, internal topics, especially those impacting their standard of living, matter more for russians (if they risk to become one more reason to blame the west when those standards are damaged by western sanctions). 

I think his main political selling point is more that he's a strong leader, and managed to make many russians believe he's fighting corruption. Despite leading one of the most corrupt regime ever seen on earth, he never forgets to make examples, both a way to eliminate people risking to become political rivals and present himself as the guy caring for the average russian, ready to send to jail even former advisors/ministers when catched misappropriating funds etc... ( of course only those he wants to get rid of are, but his propaganda is very efficient as presenting him as a selfless crusader, despite having probably become the richest man on earth).

And speaking about corruption, he's also a master in linking the topics of economic and ""moral"" corruption (""perversion of traditionnal values"", etc...) to finally blame it all on the west, and naturally gets a lot of support for the most backyard parts of russian society, ultra religious orthodox groups, etc...",32353b5c99c881c288738c0ddc757fb204d8cb96,True,False,,,,,0,1653130613,,0,{},i9fqnj0,False,t3_uubl1u,False,True,t3_uubl1u,/r/geopolitics/comments/uubl1u/how_has_russias_attitudes_towards_the_west/i9fqnj0/,1653130625,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653101813.0,

Basically after the collapse of the soviet union and the transformation to a western style economy 90s Russia was a total sh\*\*hole (crime, instability, economic depression), not comparable to what it is today (yet). Under his rule, whether or not he was responsible for it, things stabilized and significant economic growth happened and the whole place got less bad.  
  
And that's the most important point: many russians make him responsible for taking russia out of the misery that happened and turning Russia into a actually livable place during his presidency (until now of course). That's why he had popular support for nearly everything he did, especially by the older generation who actually saw how things were in the 90s.  
  
Even though i would say that by now his actions get more and more less approved by the general public, they will still support him no matter what (at least to a certain degree) because no one wants to return to a 90s situation by any means.  
  
Stuff will get very interesting with sanctions now kicking in, it's safe to say his popularity is at an all time low.  
  
To the part with the west: I think propaganda played a huge role in russians disliking NATO and the west in general and sanctions now set up by western nations wont really help either to convince russians of anything. So when he started doing stuff against western influence, people supported him mostly.  
  
But as I said, things will probably dramatically change now and it will be very interesting what happens next in Russia, especially if Putin is gone.

[],False,,Regular-Suit3018,,,[],,,,text,t2_92dmos0l,False,False,"There are several reasons why Turkey’s foreign policy and attitude towards its neighbors makes the Turkish government very unpopular in most western nations. 

I’ll list a few reasons why: 

1. Turkish actions against Kurdish factions in Syria. It’s no secret that Turkey is at odds with the vast majority of western democracies when it comes to the national self determination of the Kurdish people. Kurdish factions were invaluable in the global efforts against Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and have been on the front lines against those people for decades. Turkey’s brutalization of them puts Turkey on a crash course with most of NATO’s foreign policy, and Turkey’s actions have indirectly strengthened Islamist factions in the Syrian civil war. 

2.  Turkey’s continued occupation of Northern Cyprus is a global outrage. While a dormant conflict in terms of violence, it’s a clear display of Turkey’s contempt for international norms of national self determination. 

3. Turkey’s continued denial of the Armenian Genocide, and its repercussions against any activists, academics, historians, clergy, or community leaders who advocate for it. Turkey’s arm twisting efforts in the legislatures of other countries in an attempt to shoot down any discussion of the topic makes it pitifully obvious that Turkey is not only unapologetic, but actively engaged in a denial campaign. This is compounded by the fact that Armenians continue to be marginalized, beaten, and even killed in Turkey at the slightest sign of dissidence. Take the case of the journalist Hrant Dink, who was murdered by a Turkish nationalist and the Turkish state looked the other way. 

4. Turkey plays dangerous games in the Mediterranean Sea. It’s no secret that Turkey is doing everything it can to expand its territorial waters to take advantage of recently uncovered petroleum reserves, and is violating long standing treaties in order to secure exclusive access to them. Turkey has threatened the territorial integrity of Greece, Bulgaria, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Italy, and France, which has unified those countries against Turkish aspirations in the Mediterranean. 

Those are Just a few off the top of my head. Others have mentioned alternate examples.",aa8f7a1839b188361e2e053f92621d802e412b01,True,False,,,,,0,1653094486,,0,{},i9ebtpe,False,t3_utuc5p,False,True,t3_utuc5p,/r/geopolitics/comments/utuc5p/turkeys_foreign_policy/i9ebtpe/,1653094497,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653065686.0,

Not necessarily an unfair thesis, but I still have trouble squaring one topic.  You can't be in NATO and expansionist at the same time.  NATO expands by brining in new *sovereign* allies, not through aggressive annexation of new territory.

I think you could make the argument that Turkey is leveraging NATO as a hedge against a classic rival - Russia.  And that may be step 1.  But then what's step 2?  Because surely it can't happen without exiting NATO.  I think that's the only way this makes sense, let Russia destroy itself in vain trying to reconstruct its old empire, then let Saudi Arabia / Iran weaken themselves with a potential hot war, exit NATO, and then get aggressive once any rival / obstacle powers have flamed out?

Not saying I agree, just that I'm not sure any other play makes sense.",4cb8fe169cc0c396dc58b71249cf53ee0b00d131,True,False,,,,,0,1653094240,,0,{},i9ebd1f,False,t3_utuc5p,False,False,t1_i9e18d7,/r/geopolitics/comments/utuc5p/turkeys_foreign_policy/i9ebd1f/,1653094255,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653065440.0,

I can relate personal experience.  A lot of it is due to ignorance and western centric biases.

To us, Turkey, especially the most recent variety, is an aggressive Islamic nation in the Middle East, unfriendly to Israel.  Some of us are surprised to learn that Turkey is in NATO.
