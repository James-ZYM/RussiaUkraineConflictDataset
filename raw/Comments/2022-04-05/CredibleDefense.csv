Yes, but India can't reach naval parity with PRC for the foreseeable future. For the same reason PRC initially focused on bombers + missiles against USN as stop gap while PLAN worked towards naval parity. And even now rocketry still is being heavily invested because conventional gaps is still large and we don't actually know how survivable large ships will be in peer scenarios. If India want's to increase coerce / deter ability, they'd be more prudent to focus on acquiring bombers / land based aviation that can reach Gulf of Aden first. Current Indian fighters has range for Gulf of Oman and that's already enough to conceivably shut down a lot of oil to make a point. Of course one need ships to interdict, Indian navy can already do that at above choke points. But IMO at the end of the day, PLAN isn't going to blockade India ports, nor is India navy capable of ""intimidating"" PRC shipping since first sign of such escalation and vessels will become PRC flagged / militarized and instructed to not obey. The step after is shooting war where all the ratios come into play, at which point India is better off having fleet of H6 equivalents for AShM runs like PRC plans for SCS. But...

I suppose this requires some skill on the operator's part, to avoid fixing the target too late or too early into the flight.

In principle, could this not happen entirely in software? Early in the flight, the laser points above the operator's crosshair point. At the appropriate time depending on target distance, the laser is brought into alignment. It would have the same effect as the operator does manually, but with less skill required or room for error.

I actually agree! I just think his nose is pretty bloody right now, although as other commenters have pointed out I may be mixing up the objective reality (Russian strategic defeat) with the internal *perception* of that reality inside the Kremlin (strategic victory still possible).

See I actually have the opposite perception of peace talks. I think they were more likely to succeed a week ago than they are now, with evidence of Russian atrocities trickling in and Ukraine wanting to make territorial clawbacks in the SE, clawbacks it can't make without an escalation in the arms they're supplied from NATO.

I dunno you're probably right that nothing is going to happen in the near and intermediate term, but the long-term trajectory is worrying. People are talking as though NATO is at war with Russia and is just pretending that it's not. That's not a good sign.

PLs usually serve for a year to year and a half. 9 months is pretty short, that isn't even a full OER annual reporting cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think your unit must have been trashed, since I was being prepared from the time I was a PFC until I got my first TL slot. It is well within an NCO's lane to train their soldiers in order to take on their role. 

I've served in many units in three branches of the US military. Its in the ""lane"" to train soldiers but its not their lane to turn them into NCOs, and most don't. SL are too busy training their TLs how to be TLs, and TLs are too busy doing everything else and making mistakes and learning how to be leaders to train Joes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We would always been give op orders, and expected to try to determine what the commanders intent was and where we fit in to overall plan.

I'm confused. The Commander's Intent is literally a part of the OPORD, [Its here in Paragraph III Execution](https://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/training_the_force/the-operation-order-opord.shtml). Either way, I used to do shit like that too when I was a TL, but I was not the norm. Most of the time I was more focused on them just knowing their jobs let alone mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Boards are dumb, but they (should) serve as a common-sense check on a soldiers potential to promote.

Boards aren't necessarily dumb, they're just nearly always done stupidly. 

I've heard of units who had 11B boards where one ISG makes the guy plot a grid coordinate. Another makes them load fill and freq on a radio. Another makes them do headspace and timing on a .50 cal. Another grills them about battle drills. Etc. I have no issues with shit like, especially if its switched up every month and based on actual MOS related tactical and technical competence. That plus recommendations from their chain of command, and their basic ERB info is enough to get promoted to first rank of NCO.  

But asking stupid Army questions out of a binder that everyone forgets about 24 hours after the board ends because they're meaningless is stupid. They might as well ask questions about Harry Potter trivia for all it matters.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I will disagree, as a good SGM can have a major effect on unit morale and cohesive, and should provide an enlisted prospective to higher level operations, as they should have more familiarity with being in the trenches. I will however say I had two trash CSMs and a single good one.

I'm not against 1SG or SGM/CSM positions, just that they shouldn't be a separate pay grade. A senior NCO advisor rank, which is basically what E7 can be replicated to other units too. If nothing else, E9 definitely doesn't need to exist, let alone E10, which definitely doesn't need to exist (nor should the position). IMO, there should not be any senior enlisted advisors beyond the battalion level, they are redundant and if the commander doesn't understand enlisted behavior or be able to enforce discipline at that level they should not have their job.",dd28b94ac6428dcfbfe2b86d91ab8fb643190c7d,True,False,,,,,0,1649197917,,0,{},i3jum56,False,t3_twtnw3,False,True,t1_i3jo8z7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/twtnw3/ukraine_megathread_april_5/i3jum56/,1649197933,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649169117.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Yeah, this is super stupid. 

This whole scheme was so retarded it didn't surprise me. This crap is straight from MG Robert Scales (ret). Despite being an idiot, he's somehow convinced the Army's and Marines' general officer corps that he is a subject matter expert on pretty much every facet of ground combat. Which he isn't, at all. In fact if you know about the subjects he talks/writes about much of its pretty cringey. He's basically a dumber version of Mike Sparks who somehow conned his way to promotion to Major General before retiring and mouthing off for decades about crap he doesn't actually understand. 

Scales was part of that Close Combat Lethality thingee that Mattis ran a couple years ago as SECDEF. One of Scales' good ideas was trying to get the Army and Marines to make infantry like a Army Special Force'esque MOS, where nobody can even enlist into the infantry they have to be over a certain age and successfully serve one full enlistment in another MOS before applying for and passing infantry selection to get in. Yes, he recommended that unbelievably stupid idea. When those in SF constantly harp how hard it is to meet their numbers, the infantry, which has an absolute shit ton of positions that need to be filled and is designed to suffer heavy losses, is supposed to be elite. 

Obviously that was impossible, so the next best thing to making the infantry more professional is to increase the rank of its NCOs. That appealed to the Marine Corps officers corps who HATE the immature and irresponsible junior enlisted subculture of the Marine infantry community especially and want to break it. So for the Marines to get a more mature infantry force without taking SF 18x drastic steps they'll just increase the pay grades of all leaders. After all, a Sergeant is more mature than a Corporal, right? And a Staff Sergeant is more mature than a Sergeant? And a Gunny is more mature than a SSgt? 

Well, these dipshits didn't realize the maturity coincides with the length of time it takes to reach those ranks, which takes a while because there just aren't that many of them. Selection is fiercer to make 0311 Sergeant than Corporal because there are 3x rifle squads in a rifle platoon while there are 9x fire teams in that same rifle platoon. SSgt is even harder to make, because there is only 1x platoon. 

By doing this they are going to get a more mature force for about 3 years, tops. At which point it all becomes watered down because they need to replace everyone. So the time in grade and time in service requirements will have to be lowered. Etc. 

Its going to be just like the Army soon. In the Army, during a decent 11B infantryman is expected to make Sergeant in 3-4 years, which is what it takes in the Marines for an 0311 to make Corporal. But if a SSgt is now going to be running a squad, WTF do Marine Sergeants do? And WTF do Cpls do? So to make numbers they will have to promote them faster. 

Meanwhile, in the meantime, a shit ton of 0369 SNCOs are about to be demoted in power and prestige all because some dipshit thought it was a good idea. That would be funny if it wasn't so fucking sad.",bfcaaf60e5e80c036fcb8744081e62c50aadcb11,True,False,,,,,0,1649196908,,0,{},i3js90z,False,t3_tp3azv,False,True,t1_i2cn0dx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tp3azv/the_usmc_just_confirmed_they_will_be_changing/i3js90z/,1649196925,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649168108.0,

&gt;
&gt;During a 3-4 year enlistment in the infantry, junior enlisted will typically go through multiple TL and SL as well as PL and PSG. 
&gt;

I never had the same PL for more than 9 months, but that could also be due to unit policy since I was in armored platoon attached to a mechanized infantry company. 

&gt;And during that time, they are still not being prepared to be NCOs because that isn't their jobs of the NCOs to prepare junior enlisted to be NCOs until they are at the cusp, and then usually their responsibility ends in getting them prepared for the promotion board, which is absolutely not judging the merits of the potential NCO in terms of ability or MOS knowledge (don't even get me started on that bullshit). 
&gt;

I think your unit must have been trashed, since I was being prepared from the time I was a PFC until I got my first TL slot. It is well within an NCO's lane to train their soldiers in order to take on their role. We would always been give op orders, and expected to try to determine what the commanders intent was and where we fit in to overall plan.

&gt;&gt;I'm sure you've heard the phrase ""Award off achievement, Promote off potential"" then. The highspeed PFC how gets their 18mo waiver SPC and is immediately made a TL is being grown in the unit.
&gt;
&gt;Except its not done. Promotions to E4 in the Army are automatic, and promotion to NCO comes with enough TIG/TIS to attend/pass the promotion board and make points, which are also totally arbitrary of the individual's potential. 
&gt;

Boards are dumb, but they (should) serve as a common-sense check on a soldiers potential to promote. I think the Navies system is somewhat superior in that regard, because they are least test on MOS competency.


&gt;The ""waiverable"" SPC is still a bullshit achievement because its the only rank that allows for it. The Army doesn't even have meritorious promotions anymore, which the Marine Corps does all the way to E6 (E5 in Fleet but E6 in Drill field and recruiting duties), which means truly stellar Soldiers get coins from lazy commanders, awards from more diligent commanders willing to do the paperwork, and that's it. 
&gt;

You can be waived to PFC and promoted in basic, although it's more rare. Awards are points which in some MOSs can help. Also the automatic promotion in different (like free E5 for reserve drills, and pretty much free E6).

&gt;Face facts, the Army NCO Education System is a flat out joke. My advise is to take it away from the E9s and abolish that rank altogether (fold E8 and E9 back to E7 as the highest rank achievable by enlisted), and give control of NCOS back to the officer corps, who are supposed to be the ones who run the military. The worst decision the US military ever made was creating and empowering the E9 ranks.

I'm not denying that NCOES is a joke. It's garbage.


I will disagree, as a good SGM can have a major effect on unit morale and cohesive, and *should* provide an enlisted prospective to higher level operations, as they should have more familiarity with being in the trenches. I will however say I had two trash CSMs and a single good one.

You are correct there is a hotline. It was not used. 

This is a quote from the article. 

&gt; Given the seriousness of the incident, India’s delayed response has been particularly striking. Immediately following the accidental launch, India could have alerted Pakistan using its high-level military hotlines; however, Pakistani officials stated that it did not do so. Additionally, India waited two days after the incident before issuing a short public statement. 

To highlight this incident as being so potentially catastrophic and enormously negligent is not a matter of the media 'drumming something up'.

A quote from you:

&gt; On top of that, neither India nor Pakistan keep their warheads mated on missiles

A quote from the article:

&gt; Furthermore, as we have written previously, in recent years India’s rocket forces have increasingly worked to “canisterize” their missiles by storing them inside sealed, climate-controlled tubes. In this configuration, the warhead can be permanently mated with the missile instead of having to be installed prior to launch, which would significantly reduce the amount of time needed to launch nuclear weapons in a crisis.

Calculating trajectory on modern SPG's is relatively easy with a GPS system. you pick a target on a GPS map (likely given to you by a unit operating on the frontlines) and the gun traversal and elevation systems do the rest of the work (basing the adjustments on their current position). (you can also likely account for variables like wind direction and speed + dispersal + obstacles like buildings.)  


The reason however that artillery pieces aren't unmanned is to compensate for situations where an AI or remote system might have failures (Issues with remote operation for example signal interference) or (AI encountering errors or other problems such as moral debates around target identification). In short problems that only a onsite human could solve.  


You also encounter logistics problems should something happen to the artillery piece and it requires maintenance something a robot cant do on its own yet. So assuming your doing all this from a Centralized C.N.C you would need to send out repair teams instead of just having the onsite crew repair the gun or vehicle in question. Either that or have said crew's near the vehicles in case of an emergency which defeats the purpose you set out to achieve.  


Finally there can be a bit of a problem with centralizing everything.

&gt;
&gt;Simply serving one 3-4 year enlistment, the length of time it takes to get promoted to the most junior NCO rank, doesn't prepare anyone for that promotion. That is like saying that all junior enlisted are learning how to be commissioned officers because they get orders from them too all the time. 
&gt;

The difference in interaction a PFC has between their TL/SL and PL is hugely different in line units tho. It wouldn't be rare for a PFC to go through 2 different PLs before promotion to SPC before a single TL. 


&gt;NCOs aren't grown in their units, junior enlisted are either directly placed in a position of authority and given time to learn it OTJ (and often that is simply because a position needs to get filled and not because anyone was stellar or deserving), or they go to a school to learn it that way. 
&gt;

I'm sure you've heard the phrase ""Award off achievement, Promote off potential"" then. The highspeed PFC how gets their 18mo waiver SPC and is immediately made a TL *is being grown in the unit.* 

&gt;The US Army in particular has never taken NCO training seriously. Early NCO schools were started in Germany in the 50s by copying the Germans, who did take it VERY seriously, but the US versions were shorter and never standardized beyond the division or corps level until the 1970s and not really until the 80s. Now they outright suck, they are a check-the-block waste of time that doesn't actually teach real leadership and nothing that is actually MOS specific until secondary schools, which also sucks. NCOES is notorious as a dumping ground for a unit's shitty NCOs to get rid of them to become cadre instructors at NCO schools.  
&gt;

I'll 100% agree that army NCOES is trash, at least for junior NCO (I only went to BLC). I would also argue that the MOS specific schools however are high quality (although I did not attend one personally, several of the MGs I knew said it was valuable).

&gt;Marine Corporals and Sergeants Course is 99% focused on drill and ceremony and conducting formal uniform inspections, not at all readying anyone for their MOS or combat. Squad Leaders Course was much better, a six week course that was focused on an actual job, tactics, responsibilities, later turning into Infantry Small Unit leaders course that TLs can go too.

India has no real bombers, like the H6 that carries a cruise missile. 

As for missiles, China has found that it doesn't really work. Nothing replaces actual powerful navy.

This is why China is expanding its navy. India needs a lot more than what it currently has to engage China, or else, like Germany in WW1, it cannot leave its harbor. 

We can do the math, even assuming China loses 1:4 ratio against India, India will be left defenseless very fast. China can lose 16 destroyers and still has 20 left, India loses 4 and it's navy has no more modern destroyers. 

Based on this, India cannot risk its destroyers, and thus cannot leave port. 

Much like Jutland, unless you can win strategically. Tactical victories could be worse than no victory. 

Why is leaving port important? India isn't insane, it's just not going to blow up ships for no reason, it has to use its navy to intimidate or intercept ships.

They are almost definitely targetting civilians in certain isolated cases, but to go from that to 'every civilian death was as a result of  intentional targetting' (which is where we are) is a huge leap that IMO requires some pretty compelling evidence.

Yeah, that's an assumption. The prevalence of the war crimes seems to support that it's not a small minority (less than 20%) and probably at a minimum 1/3. 

&gt;     War crimes lead to greater psychological stress than non-criminal war time behavior and environment

This isn't quite an assumption, but is supported by evidence. 

https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2009/11/96831/killing-war-associated-ptsd-and-behavioral-and-adjustment-problems

That study focuses on killing. IDK if there are any studies related specifically to war crimes, because surprise surprise, people do not want to talk about their war crimes. 

&gt;     Conditioning does not cause non-psychopaths to cope better with war crimes.

During the crime. What about after? What about days later? These impacts are not well understood. The 1000 yard stare is partially understood, but the causes are far from well known. 

&gt; You also use terms you don't seem to understand, such a ""cognitive dissonance"".

Uh yes. It's quite simple. Most people see themselves as good. When confronted with the evidence of doing something terrible like killing an unarmed civilian (on purpose or accident), raping a girl due to peer pressure, or other such war crimes, will create cognitive dissonance for people who see themselves as good. You hear soldiers talk about it ALL the fucking time. ""I'm a good person and I killed that guy because he was the bad guy, later I found out we were basically the same person. Does that make me evil."" is something you here from soldiers constantly. 

Right now, many probably see Ukrainians as Nazis and are avoiding the topic, or drinking away their sorrows. If the Ukrainian propaganda breaks through that, they'll be in more pain and that will significantly effect their performance.

Simply serving one 3-4 year enlistment, the length of time it takes to get promoted to the most junior NCO rank, doesn't prepare anyone for that promotion. That is like saying that all junior enlisted are learning how to be commissioned officers because they get orders from them too all the time. 

NCOs aren't grown in their units, junior enlisted are either directly placed in a position of authority and given time to learn it OTJ (and often that is simply because a position needs to get filled and not because anyone was stellar or deserving), or they go to a school to learn it that way. 

The US Army in particular has never taken NCO training seriously. Early NCO schools were started in Germany in the 50s by copying the Germans, who did take it VERY seriously, but the US versions were shorter and never standardized beyond the division or corps level until the 1970s and not really until the 80s. Now they outright suck, they are a check-the-block waste of time that doesn't actually teach real leadership and nothing that is actually MOS specific until secondary schools, which also sucks. NCOES is notorious as a dumping ground for a unit's shitty NCOs to get rid of them to become cadre instructors at NCO schools.  

Marine Corporals and Sergeants Course is 99% focused on drill and ceremony and conducting formal uniform inspections, not at all readying anyone for their MOS or combat. Squad Leaders Course was much better, a six week course that was focused on an actual job, tactics, responsibilities, later turning into Infantry Small Unit leaders course that TLs can go too.

&gt; Like I sincerely don't understand how there's a moral position to be defended here.

Say things escalate to the point of a nuclear exchange, or a very high risk of one, that inherently threatens the entire world. Seems like a pretty immoral thing to allow to happen right? There had better be a damn good reason for risking something like that, and ""protecting the full territorial integrity of a nation that NATO has explicitly said that it is unwilling to fight for"" is not sufficient imo.

&gt; We're starting to see what life(and death, as it were) is like for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation - how are we to condone that condition in perpetuity? 

This is doing a lot of work here. There's a big moral difference between ""massacres and brutalization of civilians by an invading army"" and ""deliberate extermination a la the Nazis in World War II."" Swallowing for a moment our revulsion at Bucha and what's likely to come out of other Kyiv suburbs and looking at this as objectively as we can, does the moral imperative of stopping behavior like this rise to the level of something that we're willing to risk *literally the entire world* over?

I'd say no.

We also have to look at this from the perspective of ""our"" own behavior in conflict. I didn't serve, but I went to school with many people who ended up in Iraq. When they returned they told me stories of well...there's no other way to say this: committing war crimes. They were morally wrong, the actions of my country in Iraq were responsible for the deaths of many thousands of innocent people, but the moral culpability there doesn't rise to the level of something that the rest of the world should risk itself to stop.

International relations is not a nice business. When push comes to shove, your have to consider all of the corpses that a particular course of action might create. There's no possibility for international morality in a post-nuclear world, and it seems like we're sliding in that direction.

&gt; But I do not understand how we could expect ""this time will be different"" unless Russians are pushed back in a major way.

Russia will come out of this with a huge strategic defeat under every scenario that's even remotely plausible.

It's one thing I hope most never have to experience, but to kill at close range is deeply personal.. intimate is the wrong word but I think it's the only one that fits..

Legal frameworks help us parse these events after they take place. They give us guidelines and frameworks for analysis and evaluation and often they exist to incentivize ""good"" conducts of war. They help us restrain the more base instincts that lead to violent massacres and brutality. But there is no magic switch that flips and makes someone invulnerable on the battlefield the moment someone surrenders. We endeavour to follow these rules, but if you keep firing until the moment you're surrounded at close range and then try to surrender? Well... good luck with that. War crime? Perhaps. But the battlefield is messy and clean lines between combatant and noncombatant are difficult to say the least. 

It is worth remembering the soldier rarely views the battlefield from a legalistic (or indeed even moralistic) lens. Likewise the politician rarely views the international legal system as anything more than another lever to execute political power. There is no automatic ""go to jail"" card, nor is there a powerful body with a monopoly on violence enforcing these laws. Does a firing position suddenly become a non-viable target because it's underneath a daycare? Does a civilian carrying a molotov cocktail at a protest suddenly become a soldier?

These are complex questions that defy easy answers. I would rather not quibble over the legality of actions and their meaning under international law as it is far outside my area of expertise.

&gt; So factually, trying to place the world's press, a lot of which has been independantly verified from multiple sources (say pictures cross referenced with satellite cross referenced with Google Street view) on the same footing as the Kremlin who factually haven't stopped lying for months is pretty weak.

The propaganda on both sides has been turned up to 11 since the start of this conflict. It's also been very clear that the ukrainians wanted to push the idea of russian war crimes from day 1 (and i don't blame them - I'd do the same in their shoes. they know how to push the west's buttons). After weeks of frankly ridiculous media reporting on 'russian war crimes' (It's horrible, but nobody is getting taken to the hague because a pregnant civilian died) it's difficult to take it seriously when something ostensibly genuinely heinous happens. I'm definitely not going to just believe whatever daily hysteria is being pushed on reddit, because invariably it turns out that what's been reported is horribly inaccurate. Feel free to call me overly cynical, but we've spent years fully aware of how awful media reporting is, but then people suddenly start taking it all as gospel again the moment it's convenient... despite there being massive incentives for inaccurate reporting. 

I know it's a reddit favourite, but have we forgotten the Nayirah testimony so easily? Portraying your occupier as barbaric is a tried and tested method to gain western support... and ukraine is absolutely desperate for western intervention.

Now i'm the first to admit that i haven't been delving into the evidence in detail, which is why i asked you for evidence and then clarification on what it showed. Even the 'ukrainewarvideos' sub isn't very reliable because half the footage could show just about anything, and to clarify once again... we are in the midst of an information war. You'd be a pretty fucking inept propaganda department if you weren't staging all sorts of shit (not that i'm saying the bucha stuff is staged).

&gt; Great claims require great proof, so if you want us to take them seriously the onus is unfortunately on you.

I'm curious as to why this apparently only works one way? It's my entire position, but i apply it equally to both sides, rather than just 'the bad guys'.

&gt; And remember, when you hear hooves you think horse not zebra.

You only think horse if you've been raised around horses though. You'd think the opposite if you lived on the Serengeti. 

The assumption that Russian soldiers are somehow inherently evil, have no grasp of the concept of war crimes, go out of their way to make their war crimes public is... a big one. Even the fucking nazis tried to hide their war crimes ffs. Looting? Sure that's perfectly plausible. Frog marching dozens of people into the street, executing them and just leaving them there? That makes very little sense to me

I don't even have a particularly positive view of russia or russians. When i visited moscow i watched a guy getting his head stomped into the curb whilst a policeman looked on and did nothing. It's a pretty grim society that i have no inclination to return to. But even with that viewpoint it still comes across as a pretty bold claim.

Haven't we spent weeks laughing at the 'evil kadyrov clique' in fact just being harmless social media warriors? Doesn't that give some indication of how our biases towards assuming evil on the part of the soviets/russians may be leading us to some pretty silly conclusions?

As I say i'm happy to be proven wrong, but my base position is that assuming evil on the part of those you oppose is a terrible idea. Hanlon's Razer springs to mind - can't a lot of the atrocities be attributed to wholesale incompetence rather than malice? Aren't most of the army inexperienced and useless conscripts?

War crimes are nothing new in war. We all know that. 

War crimes are, by definition, psychopathic behavior. Doing something vile and evil to another human being without the empathy of what the evilness causes to that human being. 

The real question is this, how many of the Russian soldiers are psychopaths? My guess is they are probably slightly elevated percentages compared to the general population. In the US general population, it's roughly 1%. https://psychopathyis.org/stats/ Even if it was 10X that in the Russia conscripts, we'd be looking at only 1/10 conscripts is a psychopath. It seems like way more than 50% of the Russian soldiers are perpetrators of war crimes. Being motivated by the psychopaths in the units or by authority figures (military leadership). 

What this means is that the vast majority of these war crimes are being perpetrated by people who are not psychopaths. That creates a huge amount of cognitive dissonance which creates a huge amounts of psychological problems. Things like alcoholism, self harm, PTSD, violent tendencies, extreme depression, etc. are going to be experienced by the conscripts that survive.

But that was always the case, and really India only require some missiles and bombers to hold east bound oil hostage for anyone in East Asia. Like PRC, Indian has her share of neighborhood drama, a risen India being assertive with her capabilities is given. But unlike PRC, there aren't substantial geographic impediments like island chains to impede that reality, which makes it in everyone's interest to delay Indian dominance in Indian ocean. IMO long term India getting her shit together is forgone, but in the meantime, all development signs still emphasis long term which gives PRC a lot of time / breathing space to reduce oil reliance and ultimately, increase short/medium term pressure to settle the border disputes, which is source of why author thinks India needs offensive deterrence. 

Aside, author was prudent enough to acknowledge:

&gt;But there is fair unanimity in Delhi that, for India, to accept a swap, and the “loss” of some territory, would require a bold prime Minister with an overwhelming majority in parliament. It would seem logical that a territorial settlement would require “give-and-take.” The Indian parliament is prepared to take but would viciously oppose any give—even of barren, inhospitable, strategically useless territory.

Democracy sucks at settling borders because ceding land is political suicide. 2/14 unresolved PRC border belongs to India + Bhutan whose foreign policy was heavily influenced by India. Even they're sick of India inability to settle and signed MOU to negotiate borders ratification with PRC directly last year. That will leave India the only hold out, and I've maintained PRC is pushing hard for border settlement now specifically because Modi is... ""bold prime Minister with an overwhelming majority in parliament"".

Ultimately I don't think India having the ability to threaten to hostage PRC oil changes balance much especially with respect to ongoing disputes. It's just another way to trigger devasting war over some rocks that both side have already decided it's not worth ending the world over.

Some people seem to think so, but admittedly not many are in power. The west has a lot of leverage as a broker with the sanctions it's imposed.

&gt; It seems to me that an imperial power needs to LOSE to change the calculus moving forward. 

The problem is that this introduces an element of risk that isn't present right now. Russia has been pretty clear with its messaging since the beginning that it ""cares more"" about keeping Ukraine within its sphere of influence than the west cares about keeping Russia out of Ukraine.

Scenes of violence against a cause we believe to be just provokes a strong emotional reaction in one direction, whereas scenes of violence against an unjust cause can provoke the opposite. We are often taught to evaluate violence and justice in a framework of *justification.* 

So in this particular example, videos of Russian POWs being executed by Ukrainians that were all over telegram last week have, by now, largely been ignored (in the worst responses, people on certain subs were actually cheerleading this behaviour). Media will likely give much greater airtime to the Bucha massacre for obvious reasons, but let us not lose our moral compass: it is one thing to execute POWs post-firefight (even so called ""good"" and ""professional"" armies have instances of this, see) and it is an entirely different thing to execute civilians. 

To explain this away as ""oh some died from artillery"" and ""perhaps they were armed or mobilizing to become armed"" tends to fall flat precisely because the Russians are the aggressor - if they didn't want civilians to protest or fight back, perhaps they should have just stayed home.

From an individual perspective, we can probably understand the desire for violence if you've just lost a bunch of friends trying to take a small town somewhere for days and then the civilian population comes out and protests and heckles you. But the nature of war is that we endeavour not to understand our enemy as human, nor think of his perspective.

Similarly, I can most *certainly* understand the desire for violence when you lose your home, or your neighbours, or your family members, to Russian attacks. These are human impulses, but even the most monstrous humans have elements of themselves we may identify with.

This is becoming a long post so I will cut it short. My point is that atrocities happen in war. They are a brutal part of the reality of organized violence. There will be much, much more brutality as this war continues (and I fear it will escalate). Who is ""right"" and ""wrong"" will be determined and re-determined as historians and academics pore over facts and analysis. For example, if you're old enough to remember the run-up to the Gulf War or the Iraq invasion you'll see how, in the moment, information is obfuscated, obscured, and twisted by various parties (intentionally, but sometimes not), and how much people screamed about ""stopping this horror"" or ""ending atrocities.""

Right, but the point is that the validity of a justification depends on a huge variety of subjective factors.

I would contest that any conflict russia engaged in would be considered immoral and oppressive by 'the west' regardless of how justified it is, purely based on inherent biases and longstanding political norms. Hell most people still believe Putin bombed his own people to justify a war in chechnya, because the biases run *that deep*. Doesn't matter if it's true or not, it's just what we've been essentially taught to believe, because russia are basically the ussr and the ussr are the bad guys.

Point being that basing such things on morality (whilst perfectly natural) is silly, because morality is not truth.

&gt; And even more pragmatically: humans love stories and most middle east conflicts of the past two decades have had few or no clear good guys, just lots of misery. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is like a perfect, textbook morality play, complete with wildly evil behavior on the part of the aggressor and stunning heroism on the part of the victim. Of COURSE it's going to drive more strident responses. It checks every box of every good-evil narrative we've got.

See now that's fair, but i'd still suggest there are plenty of clear cut conflicts around the world that get almost no attention, and certainly don't get reported on through the same moral lens.

IMO politics has almost everything to do with it. If it were china I imagine it would be similar, despite it being far from 'the west'.

Some women might be more likely to survive because they are very attractive and the officers will claim them exclusively. There are stories of soldiers being sent to Gulag for not respecting officers' ownership.

The ones that are still attractive but not in the top tier will be most likely used communally by several soldiers and die in the process or be killed for extra thrill. Sadly, that usually includes underage girls.

A lot of murders is simply convenience. It's easier to shoot someone and only then take a watch off their hand.

A lot of the torture is passing on the torture that the soldiers had endured in their military bases. In the Russian army privates and conscripts are essentially slaves of the higher-ups, sadistic treatment for entertainment, often including rape, is the norm.

Torturing and murdering randomly part of the population is also a great way to instil fear. Most recent example of that is Belarus after Lukashenka lost the elections couple years ago.

-----------------

When looking at what India spends on defense, it would be possible to come to two entirely opposite conclusions. The first is that it is quite modest, when one says that it is 2.15 percent of the GDP. That perception would encourage those who opine that it is too small to be tinkered with in any way. The other way of looking at what India spends is to declare that India has the third-largest defense budget in the world. This is next to the United States, a world power, and China, an aspiring world power. Even more surprisingly, India’s expenditure is larger than Russia’s when it is plain to any onlooker that Russia “does” far more with its military than India. Russia, with its budget of $61.7 billion,is handily outspent by India’s $72.9 billion—which would come as an unpleasant surprise to most Indian analysts. With its $61.7 billion, Russia almost balances the United States in Europe, has the world’s second-largest air force, and the world’s third-largest navy. All this is quite apart from maintaining a balance of the strategic deterrence with the United States, with an impressive triad. When adjusted in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms China’s defense budget, which is nominally at $252 billion, balloons to $510 billion while India‘s expenditure rises from $72.9 billion to $310 billion.

The question that rises uppermost in one’s mind is—What does India do with all the money? The answer to that comes from looking at the individual share of the each of the armed services as a percentage of the total. The share of the Indian Army is 61 percent, while that of the Navy and Air force is 14 percent and 20 percent respectively. The Army, let it be clearly understood, performs only the territorial defense of the country, so that means that India spends $40.68 billion of its defense budget on territorial defense. This is almost as much as the entire defense spending of Japan ($49.1 billion) and South Korea ($45.7 billion) and not much less than France ($52.7 billion) and Germany ($52.8 billion). Much more worrying is the proportion of the Indian Army budget of $40.68 billion that is consumed by the costs of modernization and personnel costs. The Army spends four times its modernization budget on personnel, who number 1,250,000. A table of the starting salary of soldiers in the US, Chinese, and Indian armies is revealing.

Starting salary, US Army …………………..$1,733 per month

Starting salary, People’s Liberation Army…… $106 per month

Starting salary, Indian Army …………..$370 per month

-------------------

In the meanwhile, the United States was quickly rising, even though some said that it had already risen in 1890, when its GDP overtook that of Great Britain. Hegemony was unpopular in Washington as it was considered imperialistic. The first writer to suggest a world role for the United States was Alfred Mahan, the naval strategist who said that a great power must control the sea lanes, for which foreign bases were necessary.7 These words were echoed almost verbatim by the 19th Communist Party Congress in Beijing, which spoke of China becoming a world power by 2050. Bankrupted by the expenditures of WWII and the money that Great Britain had borrowed from the United States and backed up by the huge fleet of aircraft carriers that the US Navy had built against Japan, Washington quite smoothly slipped into the vacant hegemonic slot left by Britain. Consider this—the United States took 55 years, from 1890 to 1945, to translate economic superiority into hegemony. Can China do it in 30 years? Perhaps it can. New Delhi needs to know, because to live under Beijing’s hegemony is not going to be easy.

-------------------

The failure of India’s maritime strategy to create resonance in Delhi has resulted in severe underfunding, amounting to just 14 percent of the defense budget. On the other hand, the Army’s disproportionate share of 61 percent of the budget has resulted in the Indian Army aggregating 1,250,000 soldiers, who outnumber the PLA by 265,000. Yet a combination of factors, such as adverse geography, Beijing’s vast financial resources, and the huge Chinese expenditure in border infrastructure, ensures that India can only take a defensive posture in the Himalayas. No punitive offensive strategy is possible despite spending 61 percent of the $72 billion defense budget. To live as the neighbor of a rogue hegemon, some conventional deterrent must be evolved. The land option has been attempted and despite spending the lion’s share of national funds, it has proved to be a failure. This article investigates a new oceanic option, using the lessons of the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), leveraging the Quad, to create information dominance and to create a punitive strategy. Options such as cyber warfare and the use of artificial intelligence were examined, but New Delhi has left it too late to start catching up with China, which has had a head start.

-----------------

To land up with two bitterly hostile neighbors, out of five, must indicate some catastrophic errors in New Delhi’s foreign policy. Both enmities are as old as the country’s independence... 75 years have passed, and this enmity has only grown into threats of a two-front war, which in the minds of the sensible, is a bizarre idea. The government has given no directives to the armed forces on preparing for a two-front war, as it cannot, having stunted the defense budget of 1.8 percent of the GDP.

---------------------

Does all this led an Indian analyst to conclude that a two-front war threat exists? The hawks in India believe that it does, and that it could even be a simultaneous attack with prospects of collusion in the nuclear sphere. These assessments exist in Delhi but are held by only a fringe. Even a Sino-Indian border skirmish is unlikely to lead to an open war because the strategic geopolitical objectives for a Sino-Indian or a Sino-Pak-Indian war simply do not exist. This article is based on the presumption that a punitive Indian capability against a Pakistan misadventure already exists and that with an oceanic battlespace dominance strategy in the Indian Ocean, a punitive capability against Beijing also can be built up.

-----------------

But what of the political desire for peace? Niall Ferguson, in his new book DOOM,22 avers that eventually most, if not all catastrophes in the world can eventually be ascribed to politics... Is it then fair to throw up one’s hands in New Delhi and lament that we face a two-front war for no fault of our own? It is true, foreign policy in India is made in the Prime Minister’s Office, which proves Ferguson’s theory that India faces an unwinnable two-front war owing eventually to political incompetence. Where, for instance, in India are the great negotiators of other treaties worldwide? Indian diplomats, when told that it took eight years to negotiate the SALT I nuclear arms control treaty and that it took four years to negotiate the SALT II treaty, merely look like deer caught in headlights. Compared to these marathon negotiations, the Lahore treaty was negotiated in under four days, and the warning of ballistic missile launches agreed to in a day. Eventually the buck is passed down to the Army, which has 1.2 million service members and laments that it is inadequate for a two-front war. This is monumental incompetence by both the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of External Affairs, with more blame on the former. It might even be fair to accuse the government of deliberately not conducting serious negotiations with China and Pakistan for reasons of domestic competitive nationalism.",66be54f269492585477a6f815699b9f5b4d191db,True,False,,,,,0,1649174816,,0,{},i3i7qk2,True,t3_twxutj,False,True,t3_twxutj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/twxutj/reorienting_indian_military_grand_strategy/i3i7qk2/,1649174840,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649146016.0,

FSB hacks and Russian state media have both shown that the Russian state (1) anticipated the necessary ""cleansing"" of nationalist elements of Ukranian society, (2) belived that only a small portion of Ukranian citizens were actually Ukranian nationalists, and (3) that all Ukranian nationalists were necessarily partisans and therefore not subject to the laws of war.

If the initial Russian estimate of no resistance, welcomed as liberators was correct, then it really may have been possible to apply these counter-insurgency principles to a small, pernicious class of Ukranian nationalists controlling a Russophilic society from the top down.

But that was an insane assumption to make. Most people in Ukraine, especially Kyiv Oblast, are Ukranian nationalists in the sense that they believe in their own distinct Ukranian identity and their right to a state and self determination. 

The ""operational frustration"" here is that Russians were given a set of criteria meant to apply to a limited group of people set aside from the masses who would obviously support Russian intervention. But instead, the criteria for who could/should be disappeared, tortured, and summarily executed ended up applying to basically everyone. The Russian political goals are out of line with reality.

Based on some of the rumors today that what happened in Borodyanaka is far worse than what happened in Bucha, I think it's very possible the Russian military is out of control because their counter-insurgeny doctrine is built off of the base assumption that Ukraine and Ukranians aren't real.

This seems like a crazy leap to me. I'm sure that some crazies managed to get themselves armed and found themselves in effectively lawless territory. Perhaps some of them decided to settle some old scores or did some twisted shit. 
However, this counter theory or rather conspiracy theory fails to take into consideration that all fighting age males were not permitted to leave the country and the weapons were available to all fighting age men in certain areas. This means that the vast majority were not sadist criminals.

Secondly I don't know of *any* war of aggression that did not result in civilians being brutalised by the occupier. Cities being sacked are infamous examples throughout history (literally just pick any sacking to read about) and show what the soldiers doing the sacking are capable of. 

Cooked up on propaganda and hatred of the enemy, extreme frustration at constantly seeing your comrades getting killed and things taking much longer than you were led to believe they would. These men reach a boiling point and commit terrible crimes.

There's been a worrying trend in the last decade of the US entering into and backing out of international agreements with changes in Presidential administrations. Makes it pretty hard for the US to lean on its credibility when brokering new ones.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Out of curiosity, why can't you always bypass cities?

Go check out a map of pretty much anywhere. The roads, major ones especially, all lead to and through urban areas where they intersect. To conduct maneuver war, where roads are necessary, the urban areas act as transportation nodes. Even when there are modern ""beltway"" highways to circumvent a city center, those are nearly always still inside the urban area, usually suburban or sprawl areas.

Urban areas are also often just operational and strategic importance. They are filled with people, govt employees, security forces and possibly military. They have seats of power, communication, commerce, manufacturing, etc. So like the Russian objectives in this war, most involved taking certain cities to try to overthrow the Zelensky govt, namely Kyiv. If that's the case, can't avoid them. 

At this point in mankind, more and more of every country is developing and urbanized, so it'll just be impossible to avoid.

&gt;Alternatively, what is the disadvantage to a defensive strategy in which you just refuse to give battle outside of cities.

While cities can't be entirely avoided if the countryside doesn't have enough of them, avoiding battle elsewhere surrenders ground to the enemy when it might not be necessary. For instance right now in Ukraine they can successfully defend outside urban areas because Russians can't maneuver well due to mud. And there are other channelizing terrain features besides urban that the defender can take advantage of, such as forests, swampy areas, etc.

&gt;Secondly, on your point about Ukranians being able to fight in small units, what would be the response to this as an offensive army

More recon. Recon, recon, recon. Sacrificial lead vehicles, drones, helicopters, etc. Maybe even consider slowing the advance by punching dismounts out far to the sides to skirt the road as flankers. 

More suppression, fire at known, likely, suspected locations before getting hit. It's going to be logistically tough, as it'll consume more ammunition. Arty needs to be set up and continuously leap frogging so advancing units are always in range. As soon as they request, heavy and accurate fires should rain down ASAP. 

Use smoke more often to obscure the advance. Normal smoke won't blind thermals/FLIR but there are types that will. Even without that it blinds the human eye from spotting the target first before they switch to a weapons optic to target.  

If Russia is serious about winning they should be doing the absolute bare minimum for the next few months. Take the time to consolidate rear area, build supply depots at forward operating bases, reconstitute units with new replacement personnel. Start rotating troops into secure rear areas for breaks, showers, hot food, etc. Allow time for vehicle maintenance. Give time for remedial training on battle drills. Unfuck the commo situation. Start prepping a new strategic offensive that kicks off when the mud season ends. Then launch that to take full control of the Donbas region. Afterwards, declare victory and agree to peace terms with Ukraine.",eed478ce57114177999e0b90630025df07eda3be,True,False,,,,,0,1649170945,,0,{},i3hxzcc,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3gbz5i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3hxzcc/,1649170962,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649142145.0,

MY ASS THEY ARE.

Yeah no, the USSR GDP was always less than 60% that of the US.

The USSR backed down many times against the US, the US had nukes in Turkey, yet USSR withdrawn their nukes on Cuba after the Cuban missile crisis.

Moreover this was shown in the Sino Vietnamese war, USSR are shit allies. If China attacked South Korea, US will 100% depoly the US military to their ally's aid. And what did USSR do when the Chinese army invaded Vietnam? Nothing, they were absolutely pussies, get over it, the US was many times stronger than the USSR. And this was apperent even back then.

J-11, J-15 and J-16 are currently the most advanced variants of flanker jets. I need some WW2 weapons China is using right now, there is SKS rifles for honour guards but I don't think that counts.

""Your engine were result of reverse engineer both Russian jet fighter and USA jet fighter (those were Vietnam give you from Vietnam, again we alway give you something).""

Yes, and Vietnam won't be able to reverse engineer anything for decades to come, you think reverse engineering is easy? Lmao. And no not really, China captured crashed US jets in China during air skirmishes with Taiwan, and later China was able to acquire modern jets like F-16 from Pakistan. China infact even captured the first sidewinder AA(air to air) missile when it struck a Chinese mig and didn't explode. This was later given the USSR, and was the basis for all USSR AA missiles. YES YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT, THE USSSR HAD TO REVERSE ENGINEER US MISSILES TO HAVE THEIR OWN AA MISSILES. Yeah on par with the US, MY ASS.

Your question is getting at the *jus ad bellum* vs *jus in bello* distinction. Basically the strands of political philosophy that modern international law evolved out of distinguish between the idea of just/legal wars (i.e. rules about whether the declaration of war is legal or not), and laws/norms of war (i.e. rules about how to conduct war). These concepts are tightly linked in some theories, but more often are separable, and the modern concept of war crimes evolved out of the latter. So it's built around the idea that you can abstract the act in question from the wider context of the war, and judge if it's just/lawful or not. You put aside the question of whether the war itself is criminal, when judging acts within it.

Historically that was important for the idea to get any traction at all, as jus ad bellum was always a precarious and debatable concept (e.g. there've been widely-held, if not always followed, norms about conduct in war since antiquity--truce, heralds, etc--but restrictions on the right of states to wage war have always been highly culturally-specific, like no attacking our co-religionists, or no wars in certain festival seasons). I guess an argument could be made that now that just war theory has matured, the concept of war crimes should be more closely tied to it. But you'd probably find it does more to undermine the idea of war crimes than it did anything to strengthen the idea of just war, plus of course the practical ""the penalty for lateness is death"" problem",f952061a8efb10fb40175210266d8fd095a34c95,True,False,,,,,0,1649165315,,0,{},i3hk8bp,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3h3md5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3hk8bp/,1649165326,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649136515.0,

This is only relevant if the war stays hot for a long time. There is a lot of training necessary for operation and maintenance for anything that is non-Soviet that the West can send them.

First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were ""discussing freely"" among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said.

Which to me seems flawed on many levels, because there's a huge difference between 'punishing' the germans for the horrors they inflicted on the USSR and the idea that modern russian troops are inherently going to enact the same crimes.

There are certainly some similarities between 1940's Red Army and Russian Army in Ukraine, like the looting and rapes. That's what shocking - Germans inflicted horrors on the civilian population in Russia, which would kind of excuse the conduct of the Red Army, but Ukrainians did do any of that, yet here we are again.

&gt; Not to mention that the ukrainians were the same people (the USSR) committing those atrocities.

I absolutely agree, all humans are capable of compassion and empathy, only the authoritarian systems of propaganda in Soviet Union or Putin's Russia can turn military into a genocidal machine.

&gt; Isis were awful, but they didn't pose an existential threat to the west in the way that say nazi germany did, where we could justify all manner of atrocities on the basis that we had to do anything to end the war.

ISIS were an existential threat to many ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East. They also had ambitious plans with regard to Europe.

You think the Russian army cared about civilian casualties in countries it liberated?

Well ironically people are now using the atrocities of the 'liberating' red army in 1945 to try and draw parallels with the current conflict. Which to me seems flawed on many levels, because there's a huge difference between 'punishing' the germans for the horrors they inflicted on the USSR and the idea that modern russian troops are inherently going to enact the same crimes. 

Not to mention that the ukrainians were the same people (the USSR) committing those atrocities.

&gt; Ukraine does not need to be stopped like ISIS, it is not comitting genocide, it is not a operating gulags or concentration camps, so outrage at civilian losses on Ukrainian side is absolutely justified.

People aren't complaining about the deaths of civilians based on the justness of the conflict though. They're complaining about civilian deaths in and of themselves. The current narrative is that civilian deaths during *a war* is utterly reprehensible, not thta civilian deaths during *this particular war* is reprehensible.

Isis were awful, but they didn't pose an existential threat to the west in the way that say nazi germany did, where we could justify all manner of atrocities on the basis that we had to do anything to end the war. We're happy to ignore the hundreds of thousands of children in yemen who have *DIED* of starvation, which has nothing to do with collateral damage, they're just disposable i guess? i say this as someone that thinks the conflict is tragic but necessary. They didn't die because 'we had a job to do and they were caught in the crossfire' or 'for the greater good', they died horrific deaths because we just didn't care about them. There was no moral justification for those deaths, just apathy... because civilian victims of war are an irrelevance until such time as it is convenient politically... as i said.

The NYT story discusses an example of exactly the same issue surely? We say it was a legitimate military target, they say it was a clearly signposted civilian safe house.

Discussion of things such as war crimes can only be a discussion of principle. It cannot be solely based on your own political persuasions.

Though i'll accept it was a bad example as in theory we had the blessing of the iraqi 'government'. Do i need to go further back to the Iraq war to match the 'genocidal war of conquest' moniker? Because whilst objectively it was a war of aggression leading to mass loss of life, people will look for any excuse not to frame it as such. When you're arguing based on 'the law', morality is an irrelevance i guess is my problem. The framing of war through a moral lens has always been both essential from a public messaging standpoint, and largely irrelevant from a geopolitical/ legal one.

We cannot frame it as morally reprehensible to intervene in the sovereign affairs of another state, but then say it was morally ok to bomb syria because we didn't like isis. The two stances are entirely contradictory. And i say this as someone who has no issues with bombing isis.

So a 9 month bombardment of the city that completely flattened it (60-70% destroyed), in which the RAF was second only to the US in terms of missile strikes, in which ISIS used civilians as human shields... and a year later the best we can do is say 'yeah we might have killed a few civilians, but that's not the official line'. It's basically an off-hand dismissal of the issue. 

The chasm in terms of reporting of the current conflict and previous ones is mental.

&gt;&gt; The source, who has not been named to protect his identity, says it was ""impossible"" to conduct a bombing campaign in highly-populated areas, like Mosul, without killing civilians.

&gt;&gt; He said he had seen evidence that British airstrikes had caused civilian casualties ""on several occasions"".

&gt;&gt; ""To suggest they have not - as has been done - is nonsense,"" he added.

Is it just a case of the ukrainian government just being far more capable of exploiting the western media establishment for their own ends, in a way that obviously your average middle eastern country just can't? Is it that we just can't empathise with 'brown people' in the same way? Is it that there's less of a language barrier with ukrainians? Is it that we've been completely desensitised to destruction in the 'developing world' (though i'd argue that v much includes ukraine who only rank 109 in GDP per capita, though Most likely wouldn't see them that way)? Or is it simply that we're unwilling to criticise our own forces or confront our own obvious biases? Has there actually been a damascene conversion in the west to the point where we actually care about this sort of stuff? Is it just an innate factor of how our media industry is organised, with significant assets within europe, but a lack of funding for reporters in places such as syria or yemen?

Close Air Support is important and plays a key role in modern warfare but it should not replace Artillery. As a general rule Artillery can suppress an enemy in area defense for extended periods. This is vitally important as this suppression is what allows infantry and armored forces to close with an opponent without being hammered by the enemy's fire.Without this suppression, ground forces will struggle to achieve their objectives . Air power despite its lethality and precision cannot suppress an enemy, nor at this stage can drones. This is what artillery does for ground forces.   

The problem is that Russia and China have watched western air power run rampant for the past 30 years and know that they cannot match it. It is the reason that Russia in particular has invested so heavily in integrated ground-based air defense to shield themselves from air attack ( also why the west has invested so heavily in the F-35) and use their artillery - both traditional tube and rocket artillery to win battles.  

This has led to some systems bein out ranged - but for the west, we never expect to operate without supporting air power so it is not as big an issue as I think some expect it to be. What is more important is maintaining a rapid and responsive artillery command and control system that allows responsive calls for fire from different artillery systems while they are moving rapidly around the battlespace, and ensuring that where we need artillery we are able to get them the right type.

Both sides accused each other of breaking cease fire, in my personal opinion neither side was happy with agreement and that's why it was never implemented.

Civilian casualties mounted up to 3k, last year it was down to 7. Their living conditions definitely worsened during war, a lot of people were displaced. Rebels leader admitted on carrying out executions on several occasions, although I'm not sure if that was targeted at civilians, pow or his own troops. Ukraine probably shelled residential areas. It is also very likely DPR/Russia were placing artillery in residential areas.

I really don't know how to answer your question. Did people suffer in Donbass? Yes. Were they mistreated? I you can call it that. Was it Ukraine government punishing Russian speakers? I don't think so, there was a war and it had nothing to do with the language people speak. Ukraine were fighting for its sovereignty, rebels/Russia were fighting for control of territory. It does not mean that majority of people in Donbass wanted to separate, no one, neither Ukraine, nor Russia really asked them. Some central eastern survey in Donbass said that 55% would like to reintegrate with Ukraine. Your guess is as good as mine on how credible that was. 

Don't know if I can find sources, but I remember Ukraine asking for UN peace keepers in Donbass several times, but Russia vetoed it every time.",1ec8a14b18557a8d2eefa042388c51c92fca9182,True,False,,,,,0,1649150783,,0,{},i3gwj95,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3fdt39,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3gwj95/,1649150796,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649121983.0,

Nato could pull back from their 2008 invitation to Ukraine for nato membership and write formally that Ukraine would never join, and Ukraine would never host US/nato troops and weapon systems. Moreover, Ukraine would abide by the Minsk agreement which they signed along with Russia, Germany and France and allow autonomy to the Donbass in a revised constitution that also guaranteed protection for the Russian minorities including language protection. This would be followed by elections in the Donbass and Ukraine in control of the Donbass-Russian border. These moves would have resulted in the Donbass gaining political power/representation within Ukraine, but also have it remain within Ukraine. Unfortunately, the consensus in Washington was that there should be no compromises with Russia, all their security concerns are trivial, and they were still the Russia of the 90s and too weak to seriously go through with their threats regarding their redlines. 

From what I'm reading about the preliminary peace negotiations, it seems that Ukraine is axing nato membership and giving up on nato exercises, weapons and personnel without explicit Russian agreement. They want security guarantees from nato aka a soft article 5, but it seems France and Germany are not willing and there's still debate over Crimea and the Donbass. Realistically, it's unlikely those will return. This seems to be be the best case scenario and is being pushed by France, Germany and Israel. UK, US and Poland seem to be still on the uncompromising track and want to pump Ukraine with more weapons and extend the war.

This is the question.

My guess (with some evidence) is that China basically encouraged Russia, suggesting they were starting to move towards putting pressure on Taiwan, and a unified axis against western encroachment would make it difficult for a weakened west to effectively respond, likely leaving us in paralysis.

Emboldened by this, they started threatening more and more, finally reaching the point where they looked weak without action. Couple this with the way Ukraine fell after Maidan, they actually believed they could take Donbast (and Crimea's water supply), with a limited offensive.

Finally, with all the javelins rapidly coming in play, they realized even a limited offensive would be difficult in the east, so a decapitation move to Kyiv would be the fastest way to settle the issue, allowing them to remove a panicking government and put a puppet into place.

Splitting their forces for the decapitation strike meant they could achieve neither objective, and their forces were far shittier than they expected, while Ukraine actually stood up to them, and again, those javelins were incredibly effective.",beff066bb0bd06fe3a0b4767b81525165bb21cdb,True,False,,,,,0,1649137418,,0,{},i3gfuzm,False,t3_tvj8iw,False,True,t1_i3eb2cw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tvj8iw/putins_war_ukraine_can_defeat_russia_but_urgently/i3gfuzm/,1649137430,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649108618.0,

I'm genuinely not sure if Iran has avoided ""financial ruin"" or ""sustain\[ing\] it\[s\] economic viability"". 

* In PPP terms, Iran peaked in 2011 at 1.334 trillion and troughed at 1.067 trillion in 2015, a 20% decline in GDP. For comparison, the peak to trough decline in GDP for the US during the Great Recession (2007 to 2008) was around 2% in PPP terms. (It was 4% or so in nominal terms but I'm trying to use the same base). 
* Iran's GDP in PPP terms in 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available) is still 17% below what it was in 2011. It's a little improved, sure but not a whole lot. By comparison, the US in the 9 years following 2007 downturn grew by around 30% in PPP terms. 
* If you want to look for an event that's comparable to what Iran has experienced, you need to go back to the Great Depression. The US has Iran beaten on the severity of the downturn with US GDP collapsing by 30%. But the US recovered a whole lot quicker without GDP recovering to pre-Depression levels (1929) by 1935/36.  
* On a per capita basis the math is even less favorable with Iran GDP per capita in PPP terms 26% lower in 2011 than in 2020. That's not far off Great Depression level falls in per capita terms... 

So, in short, Iran's has experience an economic hits 2/3rds as large as the Great Depression on a total output basis and a loss in per capita terms fully comparable to the Great Depressions effects in the US which has lasted over a decade and still has no end in sight. If this is success, I'd love to know what failure looks like...",aa1882efb57a3ecae4bceed0398d8d3fbceb9133,True,False,,,,,0,1649136440,,0,{},i3gef5d,False,t3_tvuunn,False,True,t3_tvuunn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tvuunn/the_quds_dilemma_dealing_with_irans_international/i3gef5d/,1649136452,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649107640.0,

Secondly, on your point about Ukranians being able to fight in small units, what would be the response to this as an offensive army (obviously I would like Russia to keep doing what it's doing so they lose). It just feels as if an artillery approach (at least a ""massed artillery"") is hard to execute vs. small, mobile units you describe. I feel as if the U.S. would fare much better against such a defense strategy because:

*  we have contingents of light infantry who could suppress the ATGM crews to protect armor and allow it to be brought to bear on small, dispersed units
* We could leverage air-based PGMs for CAS to suppress those smaller units 
*  Alternatively, we could head-on confrontations with the small, mobile defense units, rather focusing on using good ISR capabilities to avoid them and isolate them, before sending in infantry to reduce them. 
* We would do a better job degrading their ability to find our formations, limiting their ability to bring their firepower to bear.

&gt; A return to WWII levels of tank attrition does not seem feasible.

And humans, especially in the developed world with low birth rates, are even more expensive. It takes 20 years to create a 20-year-old private, case in point.

&gt;To the extent that the weapon of the average infantry squad is capable of destroying a MBT there seems little reason to continue to build multi million dollar vehicles rather than just up-armoring an APC. 

The classical response, by, for example, Turkish Army is that they push more tank forward but strung them out, so that while the first tank may be hit by an ATGM, the next tank that can see where the ATGM coming from can then call on artillery and infantry to destroy the infantry squad position. with the exception of ammunition cook off, tank crew casualties after an ATGM hit can be quite limited: HEAT warhead effects are actually purely kinetic. Perhaps the drive eats the whole kinetic effect and dies, leaving the other 3 crews intact.",7f329c923c7834598e9e6927647fd191ca03c38c,True,False,,,,,0,1649132524,,0,{},i3g804x,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3g2lwu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3g804x/,1649132537,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649103724.0,

[],False,,YukikoKoiSan,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qvvxgrw,False,False,"&gt;I think Nagorno-Karabakh is probably a closer analogy and the refusal of international recognition of Crimea is as much realpolitik as international legal principles(which I will admit both influences each other). 

I don't think that's the case. Most everyone is comfortable with refusing to recognise there's a legal basis for historical claims to territories. If this was allowed, then you could end up with things like:  

1. Germany claiming a third of Poland; 
2. Hungary wishing to revise Trianon and grow itself by 70%;  
3. Mexico arguing for a return of California and Texas; 

I picked these examples as illustrations of the problems that accepting this kind of logic could mean. 

&gt;The last time a referendum successfully effectuated an annexation is India's annexation of Sikkim in 1975, which informs India's position of at least theoretically supporting Crimea's accession into the Russian Federation under a free and fair vote.

India expressed support for that once during 2014. This is from a Foreign Ministry  statement (6 March 2014):

&gt;India hopes that a solution to Ukraine’s internal differences is found in a manner that meets the aspirations of all sections of Ukraine’s population.  **It would be important, in this context, for a legitimate democratic process to find full expression through free and fair elections** that provide for an inclusive society.  India calls for sincere and sustained diplomatic efforts to ensure that issues between Ukraine and its neighboring countries are resolved through constructive dialogue

That conforms to what you said. But the Foreign Ministry later that same day clarified: 

&gt;We hope that whatever **internal issues there are within Ukraine are settled peacefully** and that the broader issues of reconciling the various interests involved, and there are after all legitimate Russian and other interests involved, are discussed and negotiated

Which, again, is *fairly* pro-Russian (insofar as it recognises Russia has legitimate interests) but was also a backdown because it unequivocally stated the matter was an internal issue for Ukraine. 

Then on 18 March 2014: 

&gt;The \[Indian\] Prime Minister thanked President Putin for explaining the Russian position with regard to recent developments in Ukraine. **He emphasized the consistent position India has had on the issues of unity and territorial integrity of countries.** The Prime Minister expressed his hope that all sides would exercise restraint and work together constructively to find political and diplomatic solutions that protected the legitimate interests of all countries in the region and ensured long-term peace and stability in Europe and beyond

This represented the final death of what had been said on 8 March. So saying India theoretically supported a referendum is true for a few hours on 8 March and... by a generous read 10 days. India's subsequent statements on the issue have been consistent with what was said on 18 March 2014. India's position remains the same. They don't recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. But they have mostly avoided criticizing Russia for it via UN resolutions. Avoiding that is more about not antagonizing Russia, a country with which India has had close relations with for a long time, than any sort of real support for Russia's actions in Crimea.  

&gt;That was also the NATO/US position that the problem is not so much you can't do that in principle, but the the means of doing it was not in a free and fair vote, so territorial integrity must prevail and Ukraine must be given back Crimea then to drag it out further. The position has definitely harden on both sides.  


I think the issue is more that territorial exchanges must, as a general rule, be mutually agreed between the parties. A referendum is a common means of determining what the people within the territory under question want. But in order for that to valid -- and for the whole exercise to have legal meaning -- you need the UN to sign off on the matter before or... *sometimes* after. 

&gt;I personally think some of my views on this subject are informed by the unique international legal personhood of the Soviet Union where you had in theory sovereign countries like Ukraine and Belarus all being UN members but are also all constituents of the Soviet Union, itself a United Nations member. 

The USSR's arrangement was a little odd I agree. I don't have any particular problems with it. The inclusion of the SSRs in the UN wasn't unreasonable. But at the same time, I understand that the SSRs were part of a larger federation and thus not *entirely* sovereign. Certainly, nobody envisioned Crimea being part of a separate, sovereign Ukraine when it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR. Had they, it would have remained part of the Russia RSFR. The same can be said for the ASSRs. They made sense when the USSR was around to ensure that the SSRs didn't interfere with the ASSRs located within them, and vice versa. Without the USSR, the ASSRs were left in an awkward spot. A better world would have seen the USSR dissolve with the legal status of all of this sorted. Instead we got... this. 

&gt;Even so, I think Russia probably a good claim on those islands by virtue of continued administration and occupation by now, which is clearly the secret sauce(see Western Sahara), you own it if you can keep it long enough.  


Western Sahara's claims to independence are much stronger. The UN hasn't recognized it as Moroccan territory and only the US recognizes it as such. In this case, I believe, only the United States is on record arguing the four islands are Japanese. The UN hasn't moreover seen fit to demand the USSR/Russia abandon the islands or call them occupied. This makes Russian possession far less controversial in diplomatic terms than Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara which is near-universally opposed.",44189e6ac72cd036f9a993b7bdbb1abf0b8d809b,True,False,,,,,0,1649132121,,0,{},i3g7aml,False,t3_tqqfjo,False,True,t1_i3cdji7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqqfjo/russiajapan_a_kuril_islands_conflict_there_have/i3g7aml/,1649132138,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649103321.0,

[],False,,somethingicanspell,,,[],,,,text,t2_nokj8,False,False,"Despite the various tank massacres in Syria and Yemen I still had some confidence in the MBT. That confidence is rapidly eroding upon seeing the next generation of ATGMs after things like the TOW.

The Modern ATGM seems to combine all 4 things that past anti tank systems tried to do. 

1. They are very cost effective - it costs a fraction of the cost to make an ATGM as it does to build a tank. This is less true at the very high end like the Javelin but is very true for something like the NLAW. Air superiority has proven to be a great counter to tanks like in the gulf war but this is a very costly way of countering tanks. Still this by itself is hardly unique  
2. They can be widely deployed among mobile infantry with little to no training. Unlike speciality anti-tank guns or even wire guided systems the modern ATGM is very easy to deploy en masse without the need of specialists. It also shares this with the RPG but this separates it from a lot of earlier systems.
3. It is very effective at destroying tanks. We probably have a strong anti-survivor bias on the amount of tanks that are hit and do survive an ATGM round. However in every recent conflict we have seen that tanks are destroyed in very large numbers very quickly and it seems that unlike some of the older model RPGs the kill rate on most modern ATGMs is pretty high. The armor on a modernized T-72 does not seem to be capable of stopping an N-Law.
4. They are reasonably long range. Older RPGs don't have great guidance so its effectiveness is limited a lot by aim. The cheaper modern ATGM seem to be very accurate at medium ranges. 

Altogether I think these 4 problems spell a major problem from tanks relying mainly on passive armor. Militaries have generally become more loss adverse. Equiptment has become more expensive.  A return to WWII levels of tank attrition does not seem feasible. To the extent that the weapon of the average infantry squad is capable of destroying a MBT there seems little reason to continue to build multi million dollar vehicles rather than just up-armoring an APC. I do grant that it will probably take a few decades before the developing world has widespread access to these weapons but tanks have always been more about peer to peer capabilities.",2da7aacbcb346e3eaed0a4e24ee15f4a881f6a30,True,False,,,,,0,1649129643,,0,{},i3g2lwu,False,t3_tw09sv,False,True,t1_i3fspes,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tw09sv/ukraine_megathread_april_4/i3g2lwu/,1649129657,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649100843.0,

""""Korea white eye wolf"", ""Japan war criminal"" , ""Viet Monkey"", India, Mongolia, USA, UK....etc . Only China is right but all the information is from China. All small countries is just USA pawn against China.""

Yeah look I don't know if you were born yesterday, but that is how every country does propaganda.

And no one ever said Vietnam is a USA pawn? China was saying Vietnam was a USSR pawn???? At least do your proper research buddy. Also China never said Thailand is anyone's pawn??? Lmao

""- They attack Chinese border, we just self-defense. -Chinese source. (Vietnam fully aware China have nuclear bomb in 1960s, why attack China ??? )""

Huummm yeah it's propaganda, what are you on about? China also has the justification of honouring our alliance treaty with Cambodia. We are much better allied than the Russians you know, since the Russians did jack shit and just had a staring contest with 1 million Chinese troops in the north, great allies you guys have.

Also, why not attack a nuclear armed country? China attacked USSR later on in several border skirmishes and the Russians ceded a tiny island on the border, no risk no reward.

""- They want Indochina so Chinese must act first.""

Yes, China's SEA policy is to stop the formation of any unified state of Indochina, if Thailand becomes the most powerful in Indochina, and attempts to spark war with Vietnam, China will immediately switch sides and aid Vietnam.

""- They want to counter China with Soviet. (In 1960s there is 2 time that China and Soviet almost broke war, nothing happen because Vietnam de-escalated both situations)""

Yeah no, Vietnam did not de-escalate, what is with Vietnam trying to claim everything? During the Sino-Vietnamese war, the Russian send diplomats and negotiated in the Beijing airport.

""- They drive Chinese out of Vietnam. (I think Chinese Indonesia wish they in Vietnam in 1998 than in their country, but again, China did nothing when their people killed, raped, robbed, Vietnam doesn't do that with Chinese)""

No it was a retreat, the Chinese advance was stalled, and the Chinese troops retreated with minor harassment from the Vietnamese army. I don't understand where you got the ""driven out"", thing. Same with the US, they left when they didn't want to send men to die to take some jungle.

""You guys just can't accept the fact that Sino-Viet war is just a present to USA and very good tool for Deng destroy his political opponents.""

No, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS, and it allowed Chinese access to Western markets and technology, hence why Chinese economy opened up to the world decades before Vietnam. If Vietnam was smart enough, Vietnam should have ditched USSR for USA, and you guys would have the same GDP per capita as China right now, even more, who knows. USSR is a sinking ship, China left quickly with women and children, you guys ditched late and got dragged down.",11d3d92c7727dfa7ee9d305e4b4c4b06adacc6d5,True,False,,,,,0,1649127399,,0,{},i3fy092,False,t3_tutc6g,False,True,t1_i3fiju8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tutc6g/taiwan_isnt_the_ukraine_of_the_indopacific_try/i3fy092/,1649127415,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649098599.0,

Which isn't to say the relative value from then to now in near peer or peer war lessened somewhat.

Beyond that, passive protection still has easily employed value in other cases. Less cohesive or disciplined insurgencies still have issues dealing with it. Wars between poor nation states or an unsupported nation of lesser power still face complications from it. 

With air superiority or better (and not lackadaisical superiority ala Russia), proper infantry screening, careful reconnaissance, and coordination with fire support there is still room to apply passively armored vehicles in some roles.

It's not dead yet although poor application is more easily punished if the resources to do so are available. It's still quite powerful in disparate enough situations as a force multiplier.

Russian armor isn't known for its targeting, communications, and sensors either. Which is the most valuable aspect in roughly near peer situations.

I would not be surprised at all to learn that CIA or other elite forces were on the ground right now in Ukraine operating lethal drones, engaging in signal jamming, or other clandestine operations.   We may never know.

""Notre but était d’enregistrer les témoignages des victimes de crimes de guerre qui vivent au Donbass. Avant la reconnaissance de la DNR par la Russie le 21 février et l’intervention de l’armée russe, les gens vivaient avec un profond sentiment d’abandon de la part de la « communauté internationale ». Des plaintes de la part des différentes parties civiles ont été déposées devant l’ONU, la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme et la Cour pénale internationale. Certaines de ces organisations ont reconnu que les plaintes entraient dans leur champ de compétences et étaient argumentées. Mais elles ont aussi souligné que la procédure impose aux victimes de tenter d’abord d’obtenir justice dans leur pays, c’est-à-dire en Ukraine… En même temps, les tirs se sont intensifiés sur la ligne de front. On a vu des gens blessés, des maisons détruites, des cratères d’explosions avec des fragments de bombes dans les jardins des maisons.""

I'm mid 30s, I've lived through enough shite and suffering to form an opinion, and as you'll note I'm a commenter on reddit - not anyone in charge of any defense policy. 

Both your and his scenario are predicated on the assumption that intervention = MAD, which to me seems just as naive given you're making out that anyone not immediately writing off any type of intervention is some 'helpless child' incapable of forming an opinion due to their age.

I'd argue the assumption that any outcome predicated on Russia (or let's be honest, Putin) adhering to any peace treaty or terms is more worthy of condescension than entertaining the idea that the future potential collective suffering of civilisation by emboldening this kind of behaviour might be worth weighing up against the future potential collective suffering of civilisation by nuclear retaliation.

What makes you think that Ukraine has the force concentrations to spare? They have a handful of mechanized brigades to free up from Kyiv and it would be incompetent to send them anywhere but Donbas.

Ukraine wasn’t able to cut off and encircle the battered and incompetent EMD and CMD (on a thin logistical tail) forces around Kyiv where they had the anti air capabilities to actually contest the VKS. As Kofman stated on his [3/21 podcast](https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/in-the-fourth-week-is-russia-revising-its-war-aims-amidst-attrition/) at 11:45 the logistical situation in the south is far better, and the quality of troops in the SMD is higher. What are you basing your assessment upon? When has Ukraine demonstrated the ability to push an entire division worth of mechanized troops out of a city in the south? How will they conduct a large scale offensive against a dug in Russian force without shifting the overwhelming majority of their air defenses to the region?

You seem to just take as a granted that Ukraine has sufficient forces there to overwhelm 9 BTGs or that it’s capable of shifting such forces there. Why? If it takes a 3:1 force ratio to attack a prepared defense (even ignoring local air superiority of the enemy and you not having a credible means of contesting it), what makes you think Ukraine is capable of assembling and supporting a mechanized force with the power of 27 BTGs in that area? Nothing in the Kherson oblast has materialized to anything beyond local counterattacks.
