&gt; You're creating a strawman that you're simultaneously struggling to take down. At no one have I suggested that the Russian's have not made progress in Popasna, or that said progress is fake or cannot be discussed. MY point has been that it means very little for the war overall, and EXPERTS are saying that, at this point, it means very little for Severodonetsk. My secondary point is that doom-posting that these limited gains around Popasna is going to lead to Severodonetsk being encircled and taken is premature at best. My tertiary point is that the amount of discourse on Popasna, relative to its importance, IS suspicious.

I used the term “at this point” a total of 9 times in my back and forth with you. I also said the following about Kofman:

&gt; He literally said that he doesn't think the pincer move would work, and that even if it did, Severodonetsk doesn't really matter in the long-term (I actually disagree with him there). 

I provided you with three independent, neutral analysts who disagreed with the Reddit hot takes at that point. Here’s what the ISW said on the day of this conversation:

&gt; Russian forces conducted several unsuccessful assaults in settlements leading to the Lysychansk and Bahmut highways near Popasna

That’s the context under which I was framing my conversation with you. Congrats, that of the literally hundreds of hot takes your comment history shows, you were finally (sort-of) right on one? 

But the bigger issue here is the severe cognitive dissonance. Russia, widely considered the second best military in the world on February 23rd, finally took the **~30th** largest city from a country that had no real military 8 years ago, **3 months** into this war. And yet still, it’s been the only point of real debate in the two sub Reddit’s discussing this war seriously for the past TWO weeks. Will the battle of Popasna really have a huge impact of this WAR? I still highly doubt it.

Furthermore, the broader conversation around providing sources (which many have been asked for repeatedly) always goes unanswered. It’s generally links to non-verified Twitter posters, most of whom tend to be right wing or ultra nationalistic Russian accounts. You’ve now deleted the comment where you said you were providing an opinion the same as Kofman was providing an opinion. If you can’t see how stupid that was (and I suspect that you can, hence the deleted comment,) then I really can’t help you. 

For my end, I was wrong on relying too much on certain independent and neutral analysts.

&gt;Some believe that… an off-ramp could easily be built if only diplomats were willing to make the effort, or if only the White House weren’t so bellicose. It’s a nice idea. Unfortunately, the assumptions that underlie that belief are wrong.

&gt;The West should not aim to offer Putin an off-ramp; our goal, our endgame, should be defeat. In fact, the only solution that offers some hope of long-term stability in Europe is rapid defeat, or even, to borrow Macron’s phrase, humiliation. In truth, the Russian president not only has to stop fighting the war; he has to conclude that the war was a terrible mistake, one that can never be repeated.

&gt;US and EU have very little sway with Ukrainian military decisions. They told Zelensky to run, he refused. If they capitulate, it will be their own decision. Furthermore, why in the holy hell would West ever make it easy for Russia? 

That's nonsense. First off, the US didn't tell Zelensky to run, they offered him safe haven if he did.

Second of all, the US and EU are literally paying for this war and arming the Ukrainians. Tough shit if you don't like the idea of it but that's power and having power means having a say so. 

 If the west stops supplying Ukraine they're fucked, they can either fight the war with sticks and stones and pay their factory workers and troops with acorns, or make a deal. 

By stopping the West wouldn't make it easy for Russia, they're just not going to mobilize their societies to create a wartime production economy to supply Ukraine. Not going to happen. 

Right now they're giving up shit in storage which is easy because it's like tapping into the strategic oil reserve, it's all just waiting for it. But the stored reserves aren't being replaced and there is no great wave of funding to massively expand production. Most manufacturers haven't even gotten contracts to increase to full capacity production or even add on extra shifts. After that they need to build more factories, which takes years because we've talking about full automation. Then dealing with unions, OSHA, etc, very limited US steel production nowadays limits output, etc. Good luck even getting those places staffed up.

&gt;Ukraine has been trying to make some kind of a deal since the war started. Russia has refused. We don't know when they'll be ready to talk.

They'll be ready after they win something big enough in the Donbas that Putin can end the war claiming a victory. That said, Ukraine has not actually made any offers or deals. 

&gt;Russian nonsensical demands about denazification and demilitarization cannot be met if Ukraine tried.

The H4's that were lobbed, that's penetration of the the Indian Air Space, i don't know what else you would call it that. They did not miss, they purposely avoided hitting the Indian Brigade Command as to not cause any casualties just like Indian strikes did not result in any casualties on the Pakistani side. There is a video of the Targeting Pod where the pilot purposely guides the H4 away from the Brigade Command.

I use it as a shorthand because it encapsulates a complex set of regulations in one phrase, not because I endorse the phrase. 

To be more longform, what I object to is Russia using its position on the UN to trumpet conspiracy theories, waste time, and generally vex everyone because it uses the organs of diplomacy to actively frustrate sincere efforts at negotiation. 

And if “rules based order” is meaningless, so is “empire of lies”, but I can easily understand that as shorthand for russia’s information warfare.

I am very glad to hear you say this as well.

&gt; In response to your reference to a flawed but less-than-arbitrary rule-based order I pointed out that before it we had a significantly less arbitrary UN rule-based order which we violated as soon as we felt that our might was sufficient to make its own right

A continuous theme has been for regional powers to flout the stated rules, make adhering to them as painful and disadvantageous as possible, and then eagerly point out any slippage on behalf of the enforcing body as proof the rules were meaningless in the first place.  

I don’t know if I would characterize the old system as “less arbitrary”, or if I would put the blame for shifts as if it were the unilateral, self interested action of the west.

&gt; Everything I said is directly related to something you wrote. I am sorry if I did not signpost it sufficiently, or if I meandered too much.

I thank you for taking the time to make the apology.

The increased doom and gloom is not just due to that.

Moreover, even when the Russian offensive eventually stops (because this definitely cannot go on forever), there does not seem to be any realistic path of counterattack. Russians can dig in and use their massive artillery indefinitely. They may run out of tanks or missiles but they will not run out of artillery.

I sometimes wonder if the real thing that upsets people about the west and America in particular isn’t their actions, but rather their idealism and how it contrasts with their actions. Maybe by comparison naked geopolitical interest seems less offensive.

I do worry that this anger causes people to engage in moral relativism. They are so angry at the prevailing power structure that they will justify anything that opposes it, even if what they are justifying is objectively worse than anything the prevailing power has done.

Yes, the so called rules based order is riddled with flaws, exceptions, and inconsistencies. It is still significantly less arbitrary than any other system we have for sorting out international disputes, and unlike appeals to naked force, is somewhat receptive to reform. I mean, what do you propose as an alternative?

A great example of the difference in mindset between the West and others was when Turkey threatened to recognize the wiping out of Native American populations as a genocide if America recognized the Armenian Genocide. To an American that threat was hilarious, because schools already teach it as a genocide. It is a widely recognized historical injustice that has no serious defenders. In fact, in the 1970s, various tribal groups mounted legal efforts to force the United States government to honor treaties it had made with natives more than a century ago. This effort was successful. Can you imagine an ethnic minority in Russia or China getting redress for 100 year old greivances?

I see the western system as the only one in which the global good has the possibility of being considered in the face of the national good, but certainly not everyone agrees.

I worry for you in particular that you seem totally unwilling to address or even discuss the things that say, Russia/China are doing wrong, at least not without bringing up something the US/UK has done to justify it.

Indeed both Active Defense, which he helped author, and the more famous AirLand Battle which has remained the basic assumption of American doctrine since 1982 are predicated on the sense-kill loop. Especially ALB which really does require deep sensing and PGMs to disrupt a Soviet echelon deployment.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Did he actually say soldiers per day or Ukrainians as a whole? I think it was the latter, and that means he might have been including noncombatants. 

That said, hiding casualties is a double edge sword. Yes, talking down and hiding losses can temporarily keep morale high, especially among those outside the military but it doesn't help with morale in the military, it hurts it. 

First, the troops themselves know how many casualties they are taking, especially if they're in combat units. Even in the rear they'll have enough veterans to pass the word about what is actually happening on the front lines. And if someone volunteers or is conscripted thinking that things on the front are great, casualties are light, UAF leadership is brilliant, the Russians are idiots and can't fight for shit, and gets into uniform and finds out all that is bullshit then their morale plummets. The worse the lie, the worse the morale. 

Second, when we are talking about casualties being hidden, how is that done? I'll tell you, it's done by senior officers telling subordinates that if they talk about their losses to ANYONE not authorized, they get court martialed. Think about what that does for morale. That's what the Russians do, so Putin can save face. That is not what democracies are supposed to do. Individuals talking to their family after a battle shouldn't be forced to lie and say things went well. A best friend or commander shouldn''t be prevented from writing a death letter to the family of a lost brother because that loss is being kept secret. Mail and phone calls shouldn't be censored. That KILLS morale.

Third, since when does taking heavy casualties mean anything negative? Ukraine shouldn't be hiding them, they should be celebrating them. Look at the propaganda effect of the bullshit day 1 Snake Island heroes who told Russia to fuck off knowing they'd die (they surrendered). Look at WW2 with regards to countries that took very heavy casualties to include in the home front. There are ways to not only mitigate that shock but to turn that into a propaganda win. Such as inspiring vengeance. Don't support the war simply to drive out the occupiers, kill them for what they did to your land and people. That's a recruitment tool, that's a way to get donations, a way to inspire. 

I really am not comfortable with UA hiding heavy losses if they are actually taking them militarily. That's going to come out eventually, even if it's from a gaff from Zelensky or a leak down the road to the press. And when it does they'll lose credibility among their people and supporters because they've been claiming light casualties since the beginning. What else have they lied about? Anything they get caught lying about is likely going to come out eventually and their leadership don't have an iron fist control on their country or the patron nations who are supplying them if they find out they've been conned so somebody can save face. 

Hell, if they're losing 50-100 troops a day that's even more reason for those who support the war to contribute more. For more who are contemplating to join up, that might be the trigger because they know they're needed. For Biden or Johnson, that might be what pushes them to send more kit, ""Good Lord they need it, they're being bled dry and we need to help them!""

It all matters if the UA govt can sell it properly. Clearly they understand propaganda, so if they choose they could sell high casualties without it blowing up in their faces.

1. Europe delivers a really strong show of force to Eastern European nations that they will be properly defended. Anti-Europe sentiment in Hungary and Poland is reduced, other Eastern European nations become increasingly European in outlook. 
2. Russia's economy is decimated, fueling a brain drain, perhaps even a fall in oil prices. 
3. Vlad suffers an internal political crisis, and maybe even a coup, less able to play stupid games with democracies anymore. 
4. Russian army ground down to a nub and unable to project power into Syria or Eastern Europe.
5. Lukashenko has an internal crisis as well(!)

If it were performed with enough gusto, you might even get some separatist revolutions to spark off.

And the best part is that it's a defensive war, so it's all completely morally clean.

&gt; * …tended to rely on conventional wisdoms of why authoritarian regimes are often bad at strategic intelligence. Such governments, the orthodoxy runs, may invest heavily in covert information collection, but they are typically poor at analysis and assessment. In part this is because of an institutional bias towards espionage that neglects analysis, partly because of a pressure to tell autocrats what they want to hear because of the personal and professional risks of doing otherwise, and partly because autocrats tend to act as their own intelligence officers and ignore the truth even when someone dares speak it, acting instead on their own judgement.

&gt; * While these accounts are entirely plausible as far as they go, none of them has considered specifically whether Russian intelligence has gone wrong precisely *because* so many of Russia’s leaders are former intelligence officers of a certain *type* and *vintage*.

&gt; * …intelligence in the democratic West had been undergoing a succession of so-called ‘revolutions’. As a result, Russia’s leadership entered the conflict almost entirely unprepared for the capabilities and uses of the 21st century intelligence that would be deployed against them.

&gt; * Their formative early professional lives were, therefore, shaped by the concepts and practices of a very specific form of police state that John Dziak has called a ‘counterintelligence state’.

&gt; * The first function of such special services, as acknowledged by one FSB official, is to act as the clandestine executive arm of the state. Their first task is regime protection through the pursuit of the regime’s perceived enemies at home and abroad in which foreign strategic intelligence is a second order consequence of that pursuit.

&gt; * During the same interval, Western intelligence was undergoing the most extensive and fundamental changes since the modern intelligence agencies were first established.

&gt; * There were, arguably, four main facets to this evolution: (1) open government; (2) shifting from ‘need to know’ to ‘need to share’; and dramatic advances in collection and processing capabilities in both (3) intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and (4) in open-source intelligence (OSINT).

&gt; * By 2018, US defence thinkers had begun to worry about the implications of the resulting ‘ubiquitous ISR environment’ for US and allied operations. How would one, they asked, achieve OPSEC and undertake operational and tactical deception in a global goldfish bowl of pervasive, increasingly advanced and widely available real-time observation accessible as much to neutrals and adversaries as to oneself and one’s allies?

&gt; * But the revolutions in intelligence affairs largely passed Putin’s Chekist coterie by.

&gt; * Out-‘intelligenced’ and consequently outmanoeuvred from the outset, one can only conclude that the heart of Russia’s intelligence failures has actually been a failure of counterintelligence.

Russia's own policies on nuclear escalation preclude using them unless truly exceptional circumstances occur (attacks against nuclear infra, total destruction of Russian nuclear capability) - so we shouldn't worry about that. 

Ukrainians appear to be concerned only with destroying military targets, not bombarding civilians, so this isn't going to turn into a PR nightmare. 

Russia is already threatening and blustering and blaming as much as they seemingly can, they're tied down in conventional war in Ukraine for the forseeable, and even after this war they're going to be in bits.

I don’t believe so. Part of the issue is that Russia is openly contemptuous of the mechanisms of the rules based order that the west prefers to work in. I don’t know if you’ve been watching the way they’ve been conducting themselves in the UN, but its like they treat every diplomatic courtesy extended to them as a weakness.

China is fundamentally much more comfortable working within that kind of framework of mistrust and misinformation than the west is, and so for the time being they make better partners. 

&gt; That doesn't mean that weapons shipments should be stopped now, but policy makers in the west should make such consideration and pounce on an opportunity if it presents itself.

That feels like kicking the can down the road to possibly present itself at an even worse time. I don’t think there will be a better time to break them of their irredentist attitudes than now, nor is there a future time at which they will be less intransigent or more concillatory.

Meanwhile Ukraine is absolutely open to being a Western aligned state who operates in that rules-based order.

There are now more senior NCO ranks too that used to be filled only by warrant officers who focused on admin and logistics stuff, not troop leading, but Russian NCOs replaced them. 

Their NCO corps is similar to the US during WW2, before the E8s and E9s emasculated the officer corps. The idea that officers train troops and NCOs are helpers was how the US did things well into the late 50s and 60s. 

I reality, only a few units (mainly VDV) have managed to be nearly entirely contract troops, so some are reliant on conscripts to fill out the ranks, but those are 12 month terms and none are NCOs. 

Additionally, Russians are known to do training exercises a lot. Way more than most US Army units have the chance.

Now it's pretty clear that at least a lot of those training exercises were dog and pony shows without a great emphasis on training to standards, wasn't realistic, and didn't prepare them for actual war. There should have been no learning curve entering Ukraine, with well trained standing armies they should be operating at absolutely maximum efficiency on Day 1 and then getting worse due to fatigue, casualties, etc. But that's clearly not things were in Ukraine. 

They weren't hopelessly inept, so their training did have value. Theur discipline hasn't cracked despite circumstances where it's surprising it's held, especially considering how many casualties they've taken, and that's impossible without quality small unit leadership keeping the men in line. So they did some things right. 

To be honest I really want to know how individual and unit training happens within the Russian military actually works.

A bluff was attempted then, it got called, and Obama welched, but it was still proof that threats can be made without a guarantee of commitment. If fact, that's pretty much how threats work. It's best if the individual making the threat is credible in terms of carrying out, but a whole lot of threats in geopolitics are just like threats made in life, bullshit.

Take some kid picked on in the by the schoolyard bully, there is no guarantee if the bully tells a kid ""give me your lunch money or I'll kick your ass"" that the bully will actually do that or that the kid will even believe them.. That's why bullies always pick their targets, they don't harass the ones who aren't scared of them, because ultimately it comes down to psychological dominance. The victim only thinks it might happen and then succumbs to the cowardice of risk aversion, better to give up the money than ever have to worry.

Or you're walking through a dark parking lot at night and someone approaches you with a cheap pistol and says ""Give me your money or I'll kill you."" Do you know how many times that happens when the gun isn't even real or not loaded? Or the stickup artist will absolutely not shoot because they don't want to catch a murder rap? And yet how many people are willing to risk their life to find out if they're being bullshitted or not?

Geopolitics is the same. Had Biden made that threat he was not bound to start WW3 if Putin called him, he'd simply lose future credibility if he didn't. And by making that threat that military intervention is on the table or in the case of China guaranteed, Xi might also not believe that threat, especially knowing that Biden is a lifelong dove and almost surely made it purely to prevent an invasion, and would likely welch.

That being said, would Putin have risked nuclear war by invading Ukraine if Biden hadn't made it crystal clear the US would not militarily intervene (we've intervened in every other way besides that, a full blown proxy war is still intervention).

&gt;Veteran US statesman Henry Kissinger has urged the West to stop trying to inflict a crushing defeat on Russian forces in Ukraine, warning that it would have disastrous consequences for the long term stability of Europe.

...

&gt;He told the World Economic Forum that Russia had been an essential part of Europe for 400 years and had been the guarantor of the European balance of power structure at critical times. European leaders should not lose sight of the longer term relationship, and nor should they risk pushing Russia into a permanent alliance with China.

&gt;“I hope the Ukrainians will match the heroism they have shown with wisdom,” he said, adding with his famous sense of realpolitik that the proper role for the country is to be a neutral buffer state rather than the frontier of Europe.

Seems pretty premature as the war hasn't turned decisively in Ukraine's favor (yet?) and Kissinger seems to be presuming a Russian collapse that will lead to them permanent EU disengagement.

As for western equipment and worries about Russia thinking it would be escalatory, everyone knows at this point Russia can't really do much about the west escalating the war.

Am i the only person that thinks this story is embarrassingly shit? It's just a baseless claim followed by an advertisement for a satellite company.

They have a photograph of a russian ship being loaded with grain in a de facto russian port. They have absolutely nothing else. Yet they state it's 'apparent theft'? That's not how it works. You might as well take a photo of someone in Kazan driving a beemer and claim it's apparent theft. At least Beemers aren't a major Russian product that you'd expect to see in Russia. I kept waiting for them to explain why they thought this was ukrainian grain.

It could equally be evidence of Russia using their recently acquired land corridor to transport *their main export* to a much more convenient port rather than shipping grain via the baltic/ east coast (I'm assuming they move it by train?). God knows they're desperate to get those exports moving right now, and shaving weeks off the journey makes a big difference.

A lot was touched on in the report and in the comments here, but even by the time Trump signed the agreement to withdraw an eventual collapse of the ANDSF was almost inevitable, at least without US forces engaged in some sort of hostilities in perpetuity on their behalf. The Taliban, or a force like it, would always exist at least as a significant insurgency while crucial political flaws in the Afghan government remained.

By far the most critical failure was the inability over decades to provide some sort of coherent national identity and vision for the country that included all of its citizens. Rural Afghans were generally excluded from decision making and never really seen as part of the ""new"" Afghanistan represented by an urban, educated elite perceived to not really understand or want to be a part of the rest of the country. Thus there was never a reason for ANDSF forces to fight outside of a paycheck. As soon as the paycheck was in question they'd abandon the fight.

Sort of related to the above, the Afghan government never really expressed a vision/desire to be a completely sovereign government that wasn't wholly dependent on US financial and military support. With no vision or plan for a future without the US as a driving force in its governance, a military modeled after the US that factored in assumptions about technology, air power, etc. was a natural outcome since their vision of the future always included a US presence. But this also meant that Afghans unhappy with the US occupation and presence in the country were effectively excluded from discussions about the country's future. It also contributed to a perception both domestically and within the US that the elites saw US assistance as a grift as much as anything else. This contributed to undermining their legitimacy, and no matter how well trained or equipped a military force is they will collapse if their cause isn't seen as having that legitimacy.

I could go on and probably write my own 40 page report specific to these issues, but the TLDR would still be ""after decades of assistance the Afghan government never achieved legitimacy in enough of the country to effectively govern it, and its military collapsed along with it when the illusion of legitimacy was shattered by the inevitable US decision to put a timeline on its direct military assistance."" For US policy makers, this meant there were no good options:

Take another decade to basically start from scratch with a new Afghan government (which would also potentially undermine legitimacy and sovereignty in the short term);

Increase hostilities in the short term (still a year or two effort) to beat back the Taliban but leave the conditions that would allow it to rise again and put the Afghan government in the same position just later; or

Rip the bandaid off and get out quickly, leaving chaos in its wake.

Preventing the collapse of the ANDSF was always fundamentally about preventing the collapse of the legitimacy of the Afghan government. While a component of that equation, the military alone was never going to solve that or even the primary factor in its equation.",5524b116c4369871b709c70944649283583f0457,True,False,,,,,0,1653399698,,0,{},i9t0ssj,False,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t3_uvzvzw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9t0ssj/,1653399715,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653370898.0

If Girkin’s latest postings are correct then it appears Ukraine may well have made the decision to pull back from the salient and form a more tenable defensive line. It is unfortunate to allow more land to come under brutal occupation, but it really does not seem like Ukraine has a better option for the time being. They could probably hold Bakhmut-Siversk or if they are really pressed, Bakhmut-Slovyansk, for a long time. Maybe a line like Avdiivka-Toretsk-Bakhmut-Slovyansk/Siversk - minimal salients, decent urban defensible areas, and it maintains control over much of the Donetsk Oblast. But this would hinge on Avdiivka remaining secure (plus likely need small counterattacks to secure the highway north of here) and Bakhmut holding in the near term, as the former is the anchor for this new line (next urban defense is a long way west) and the latter is the crucial strong point for conducting a successful retreat from the salient.",a07c4cf8497a2bc9d4236ae0b33f90fc00632abc,True,False,,,,,0,1653398335,,0,{},i9sxzlw,False,t3_uwp5x4,False,True,t3_uwp5x4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwp5x4/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_24_2022/i9sxzlw/,1653398350,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653369535.0

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"&gt; * These debates produce an unappreciated competitive advantage: a healthy marketplace of ideas in the profession of arms. 

&gt; * What the dialogue to date lacks is a broader conceptualization of how the character of combined arms is changing in what is best described as the new missile age. 

&gt; * The ability of tactical units — from squads to individual fighter aircraft — to conduct precision strikes across the depth of the battlefield, all captured and circulated on social media, changes how we think about tempo, decision-making, and combined arms.

&gt; * As artillery grew more powerful and shifted from direct to indirect fire assets and aircraft entered the fight, these concepts transitioned to modern mechanized warfare and blazed a trail of destruction. Arguably this art of battle (i.e., tactics) struggled to bridge operational art and campaigning to achieve true strategic objectives. Yet it has enduring value and serves as a template for combat to this day.

&gt; * The proliferation of precision strike in a connected world alters battlefield geometry and creates a new character to combined arms: What can be seen can be hit, and what can be hit can be destroyed. What can be uploaded can mobilize people and resources.

&gt; * In contrast to mass, firepower, or linear maneuver-based warfare of the past, the defining characteristic of modern war is decision. 

&gt; * U.S. military dominance on display during the 1991 Gulf War ushered in a decade of military cognitive stagnation. The U.S. Air Force figured, why fix what didn’t seem broken? The Army and the Marine Corps laid out bold visions but struggled to adapt due to contingency operations and diminished budgets

&gt; * While the U.S. military fought across both the Middle East and the bureaucratic battles in the beltway, Russia and China gathered their notes from 1991 and designed a future fire-centric force that could hold U.S. power projection at risk.

&gt; * Gray zones and salvo exchanges are the new coins of the realm, not mass tank or air-to-air battles.

&gt; * Too often, the methods used to determine a way ahead — from wargaming to defense scenarios — tend to lack robust samples and risk overgeneralizing from narrow cases that may not reflect how war is changing. Just as international relations for years abused 1914 as a crucial case to hypothesize the causes of war, the national security community runs countless wargames that often wish away politics and logistics and, worst of all, lack enough iterations to draw even bounded conclusions. 

&gt; * Take the U.S. Marine Corps:  While the service used an iterated series of wargames on the road to Force Design 2030, the use of non-disclosure agreements limited the ability of a larger community to debate the merits of the findings or run competing experiments that falsified the design. The net result? What Karl Popper called pseudo-science and an increasingly emotional as opposed to rational debate. 

&gt; * While efforts like Project Convergence and Force Design 2030 replicate the best of these traditions, they can transcend the trap of pseudo-science by showing their homework and subjecting themselves to rigorous hypothesis testing. The foundation is there. The data just needs to be captured, structured, and independently tested to validate the predictions. The process will need to be transparent so that it can be replicated — the gold standard in modern science.

At the end of the article there was a bit of criticism of Berger and the USMC Force Design 2030 where the author calls for the wargaming to be declassified and put into the open. To be honest it is the first time I have read of a criticism of the changes that makes any sense. It does not address however, the concerns of declassifying the results of wargames on an incredibly sensitive topic. I doubt the real results of the Fulda Gap war gaming was revealed in the 1980s either, as an example.

&gt;In May 2002, the United States began training the ANA, with U.S. Special Forces leading the effort. Recognizing 
that training a national army was beyond the core competency of the Special Forces, the United States 
deployed the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division to expand the training program from small infantry units to 
larger military formations, and to develop defense institutions such as logistics networks. However, the U.S. 
invasion of Iraq in 2003 removed a key resource from the Afghanistan mission: active duty military units to 
train the Afghan military. Instead, training the Afghan military transitioned to steady rotation of Army National 
Guard units.

While Army Special Forces is specialized in training local forces in small unit tactics and unconventional warfare, they are specifically trained to understand and work within cultural and ethnic idiosyncrasies of their area of operations.  While the paragraph does point out the most prevailing single issue that doomed the mission in Afghanistan (that being the Invasion of Iraq), the idea that regular army units were better equipped to develop the ANA is somewhat nonsensical. Building larger military infrastructure in the macro and focusing on the type of training provided by Army Special Forces in the micro are not mutually exclusive. 

The paragraph also suggests that after 2003, there were no active duty military personnel training the Afghan defense forces; which was of course not the case. It also talks about a steady rotation of National Guard units being the main source of training. For starters, National Guard units were no more or less rotational than active duty units. The paragraph singles out the 10th Mountain Division as if they would have stayed in the role but for the Invasion of Iraq. Whereas, since we are talking about the space between 2002 and 2003, this was just the time frame of what would have been a single deployment. 

Furthermore, the notion that Army National Guard units were any less trained or capable of training the Afghan Army in the way that the United States was trying to train them is without merit. Active Duty units have no more training to conduct such a mission than National Guard units. Although, when talking about a number of MOS, Active Duty units do have the benefit of performing a skill set that is inherently difficult for an individual to develop a higher level of proficiency as a reservist, this is not universal across the board. The Guard soldiers participating in the training mission were just as capable (or incapable) of building the Afghan military as Active Duty ones.",6ff7bb7488331dfa2f1a60e21dc8c91b8c365f25,True,False,,,,,0,1653388993,,0,{},i9sirhh,False,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t1_i9ol4an,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9sirhh/,1653389006,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653360193.0

Instruction is not something the average active duty NCO does well, part timers are usually not very well trained themselves, most companies have a few dudes who are squared the fuck away and high quality trainers,  they typically get tasked to run most of their own unit training, but a mission like the one done is all hands, very basic stuff, right from the manual, nothing fancy. 

Could that have made a big difference? For knowing how to use certain equipment like Javelins, our radios, and other equipment, certain basic tactics, sure. But a far cry from what I would call high quality training. Especially since a whole lot would need to be done through interpreters which doesn't help matters.

So much of the retired generals that are on tv and print media talking up the training they ran need to be taken with a grain of salt. First, basically every officer above the rank of major is full of shit to some extent, showmanship is a big part of leadership and the higher they advance the more they specialize in bullshitting. By the time they get their first star they can duck Congress, con their troops, and convince their wives not to divorce them (they do political marriages too). I trust generals as much as a politician, which is essentially what they are anyway.

Plus no general really sees any training or even watches it, how would they know what's happening?  They don't even bless off on training plans, that's done way lower. If they show up to occasionally check things out what they see is not normal training, as a general showing up to watch you is a giant dog and pony exercise where everyone is on their absolute best behavior. Generals are like CEOs of giant companies, they have no clue what is happening, they focus on big picture stuff like managing the overall support mission, dealing with logistics and diplomacy, ""mentoring"" Ukraine generals, but they're not doing shit in the field, they stop doing that stuff as colonels.

Two mech brigades means 12x company sized tank/IFV task forces to either reinforce various hard pressed points or to use them to counterattack. Each brigade would have come with 3x battalion of self propelled and rocket arty, and every extra bit of arty helps in positional war. An engineer company to help build defenses and lay more minefields. A sniper company to go hunting. EW company. Etc.

Sure, they'd suffer attrition too but it sure would be nice to not worry about [what this map shows](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FTezG4QXoAAVLG-?format=jpg&amp;name=large), which if accurate is pretty depressing. I'd want to see more UA brigades present, not fucking off doing other things that obviously didn't work as intended.*

I am curious as to how much mobility the UA have in this battle, if the amount of drone coverage is so heavy due to the limited space they need to cover that any mech units driving draw arty or airstrikes whenever they move out from cover/concealment. 


*The 2x brigade UA counter attack NE and E of Kharkiv pushed 3x weak Russian BTGs on the outskirts of the city to retake ground that didn't help anything really. It was probably intended to draw off more Russian forces from Izyum but didn't. Then the UA used another 2x brigades to attack Izyum itself and that actually got the Russians to bite, but at that point Izyum was no longer the main effort and they'd shifted enough forces to do what they're doing now.

Well played Russia. Well played. It's not a big win. A few cities. The only real win comes if they can cut the ~5 UA brigades plus a bunch of independent battalions that are deep in the pocket, if they can prevent them from retreating that'll be a damn shame. FYI, that'll be the equivalent of about two divisions, though at this point they're all probably still very understrength it'll still be a good win.

A reading of their definition of ""intentional crises"" could easily be applied to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, as a situation where ""the party"" (China) stirs up the crisis to achieve the political aim of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. But the second part offers the political leadership an excuse to attribute responsibility of any crisis to Taiwan's political leadership. China's propagandists will argue that Taiwan's refusal to bow to Chinese demands ""pushes the confrontation towards the edge of war"" and forces China to resort to force to (I'm making up the language here) ""quash independence forces that caused the crisis"". **This is the Russian playbook**. Claim that you ""had no choice"" but to act to prevent a hypothetical and nebulous existential threat; in the case of Ukraine, alternately, ""Denazification"", NATO nuclear weapons at the Russian border, a native Ukrainian nuclear weapons program, and everything in between; in the case of Taiwan, the usual ""independence elements"".

I agree with what you saying except for the Russian playbook part. The section you have quoted talked about two scenarios, 1) state looking for any excuse to start a war, 2) state bluffing and trying to intimidate their opponent while actually not wanting to start a war. 

An example of scenario 1 would be the Iraq war where WMD is just an excuse. I think this is where your proposed Taiwan scenario falls into. But the current Ukraine war seems more like a scenario 2 that have backfired. Russia didn't seem to actually want to start the war, which is why most are surprised about it. Because they have failed to achieve the objective, they keep escalating military responses which eventually forced them to start the war.

However, that’s not to say the last few months hasn’t given them variables to consider, in fact I think they have multiple: 

- Their assessment of Russia as an ally (and a threat) has likely changed as Russias strengths and weaknesses have come to light.

- will likely be looking at the types of sanctions the west has been willing to impose and whether or not they have the ability to withstand and counter them.

- They’ve seen the Wests willingness to provide assistance to Ukraine, as well as the lines some states are unwilling to cross.

- They will be watching (as Will Taiwan) to see what works well for a theoretically inferior defender against a theoretically stronger aggressor.

Ok so I guess I'll make this as clear as I possibly can.

A publication cites an anonymous government source.  They won't tell you their identity or position, and they legally cannot be forced to either.  Effectively no proof of their existence or what they said will ever appear, except the word of the publication.

Also, the claim they're attributing to the figure isn't one that future events will ever prove incorrect - in this case, if SOF never go to Kyiv, ""I guess they changed their mind"" is all that it would mean.

Piracy has impacted China as well, with a number of their ships getting seized off the Somalian coast over the years.

There's about a 1:1 force ratio in the Donbass atm and yet Russia is still advancing, when a 3:1 ratio in Russia's favor would probably be required if all other things were equal.

The balance favors Ukraine over time though. Russian forces are being worn down, and their losses not adequately replaced. Meanwhile Ukraine is getting better equipment from the west and their soldiers are rapidly gaining experience.
