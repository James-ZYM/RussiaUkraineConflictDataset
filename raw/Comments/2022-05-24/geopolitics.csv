[],False,,jogarz,,,[],,,,text,t2_jde8q,False,False,"The United States and China were hostile to one another during the first half of the Cold War. This included coming to direct blows during the Korean War; during the second stage of the war, US forces were mostly fighting Chinese forces, not North Korea. Short of a full-scale declared war, relations couldn’t get much worse.

Fast forward a couple decades, though. After the Sino-Soviet split and the US drawdown in Vietnam, the two countries began to see more promise in working together. Both were worried about the Soviet Union potentially dominating Asia, so collaborating on that front was common sense. The US officially cut diplomatic relations with the rival Chinese government on Taiwan (while maintaining informal ties), while China backed off from hostility towards US allies in the region. After Deng Xiaoping came to power and began instituting his economic reforms, the United States and China also developed extensive trade ties.

Things seemed to be moving in the right direction, but the mistrust never completely went away. China still had some feelings that the USA were arrogant imperialists desiring to overthrow their government, while the USA still had some sentiments that China was a cruel authoritarian despotism with ambitions to displace the US as superpower. This lingering mistrust was brought to the forefront by the Tiananmen Square protests, the subsequent massacre, and the Western reaction to it. Still, both sides decided to bury the issue rather quickly; the US even dispatched diplomats to China saying that the sanctions in response to the massacre were done as political necessity and would be lifted sooner rather than later (and they were).

Still, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the two sides lost one of the main geopolitical issues they agreed on. This likely made it easier for other issues to drive them apart. Here’s a few things that drove the division:

- According to geopolitical realist principles, America would inevitably be anxious about a rising military and economic power that could potentially threaten it. Unlike the geopolitical realists, I don’t think power is the only important feature of politics. But it is *an* important one, and it can’t be ignored.
- China’s authoritarianism and abysmal human rights record made it a frequent target for criticism among activists, who lobbied Western governments to stand up to China on those issues. The US and its allies were indeed concerned about this, but they believed that economic ties would ultimately help liberalize China, and that humanitarian concerns weren’t enough to trump the economic relationship anyway. However, political liberalization in China was slow, and it was ultimately reversed under Xi Jinping, who cracked down on what spaces for free speech and expression had existed and solidified his personal power to become a dictator. China, for its part, loathes domestic criticism as treason and sedition, while hating external criticism as meddling and interference.
- While still maintaining extensive trade ties with the West, China also actively worked to build an alternative global bloc. This was mainly done by building ties with other regional powers (see BRICS) and with illiberal states (Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, etc.). This obviously increased anxiety from the United States that China wanted to displace it, on top being rankled by China’s support for openly hostile states.
- Related to the above two issues, China’s opposition to democracy and human rights expanded from a domestic stance to more of a global one, and China became more of a spoiler to any efforts to promote democracy or human rights internationally. This is frustrating to the US, as every non-Trump administration since Bill Clinton has made democracy and human rights promotion at least a secondary concern. 
- The trade dynamic between the US and China contributed to US manufacturing wilting away. It was always going to be hard for US workers to compete with the low wages and poor conditions of their Chinese counterparts, and the result is lost jobs. Some Chinese economic practices, which are perceived as unfair, have caused further resentment. China isn’t the only country the US has lost manufacturing to, and the US itself is partially to blame for both losing the jobs and failing to transition the workers to new ones. But “Made in China” *is* one of the most recognized symbols of this decline, and that causes many Americans to resent China.
- Finally, as China’s military power has grown, it feels more comfortable flexing its muscles in Asia, and trying to dictate terms on long-running disputes. This has alarmed nearly all of China’s neighbors to some degree, who all stand to lose. Since America is an ally of many of these neighbors, it also alarms America. This trend has been accelerated since Xi Jinping came to office; Xi has leaned significantly into nationalism as a pillar of the Communist Party’s popular support, which puts more pressure on China to take a hard line on international disputes, especially territorial disputes.

So, the answer is that it wasn’t really any one thing. It’s the combination of many decades-long trends and a lingering mistrust between the two that never fully vanished.",ece41a388e9fa2778d41e899501c08bdf7fb99aa,True,False,,,,,0,1653435628,,0,{},i9vcmgu,False,t3_uw5l72,False,True,t3_uw5l72,/r/geopolitics/comments/uw5l72/what_started_the_sinoamerican_rivalry/i9vcmgu/,1653435642,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653406828.0

It was a prominent city during the Hanseatic and Prussian periods.  
The Baltic map is scrambled today by the great shuffling and enforced migrations that followed after Stalin’s armies marched to Berlin. Stalin kept part of Poland that he had gained through the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement.  He added some bits and pieces and compensated Poland with chunks of East Germany, including the old Junker estates.  Thus Danzig became Gdańsk, and Konigsberg was renamed Kalinin after a Russian General.  But at this point, the ever paranoid Stalin decided he wanted an enclave the USSR could use to ensure the Germans could not reunite or ally with the Poles.    
It was an intelligent- if cold blooded- decision since the enclave sits at the juncture of the Germanic, Slavic, Nordic and Baltic regions.    It was considered a good city to live in during the USSR days since it was cosmopolitan and had access to Western goods.    
It is now heavily militarized and has no special international status since it is part of a Russian Oblast.

Notice how Ukrainian conditions for peace have shifted away from ""why can't we all just stop shooting"" to ""only if you leave all of Ukraine and go home""?

As far as the Republican party is concerned it's clear they don't have any ideas and don't stand for democratic values. 

Voter apathy is a huge problem with Democrats as well as them having to deal with Manchin and Sinema. 

Health care is another. We spend more on health care then anywhere else and the quality of care is much lower than in other industrialized societies. 

Not to mention the IRS being gutted by Trump and  Dejoy as post master. It was bad before but I work in a tax firm and we still get estimates that they're a year and a half behind. 

As an aside I really feel like most problems with voter apathy stems from people not believing in themselves and feeling like they don't have any agency. Democracies rely on an informed populace and most Americans only read at an 8th grade level and only 35% of the population has bachelor's degrees is it really any surprise that the general public isn't that effective at making informed decisions? 

The whole point of social contract theory is that sovereignty is given by the people before the constitution we had the articles of confederation and we changed them when we realized the government was too weak. People put way too much blind faith in authority and tradition. We don't have the luxury of sitting on the sidelines and passively accepting everything our leaders tell us. Authority should always be questioned and scrutinized and just because somethings is a tradition doesn't mean it's good for us.

""Crises illuminate the contours of world affairs, and the war in Ukraine has had a clarifying effect on the Biden administration’s approach to the world. Since taking office, U.S. President Joe Biden has argued that the struggle between democracy and autocracy is the defining clash of our time, even as critics and some members of his administration haven’t always agreed. For Biden, at least, the Russian invasion and the world’s response to it has proved that he was right all along.  
In his State of Union address in early March, Biden described the war in Ukraine as a battle between freedom and tyranny. In Warsaw a few weeks later, in another speech replete with Cold War echoes, the president announced that Washington would lead the free world to victory in a great struggle “between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.”  
Biden has good reason to be hitting these themes hard. The Russian invasion has shown how deeply the struggle to shape global order is rooted in opposing conceptions of domestic order. It has clarified and intensified the struggle between advanced democracies and Eurasian autocracies. And it has given Biden’s foreign policy, which seemed headed for frustration if not outright failure just a few months ago, a new lease on life. Yet critics of the democracy-autocracy thesis aren’t wrong to argue that the world isn’t quite so simple. Winning this contest of systems will require crafting a strategy that takes these complexities into account.  


Biden must first specify what Washington opposes—not the existence of autocracy but that combination of tyranny, power, and hostility that so threatens the United States and the international order it has built. He must then flesh out his concept of the “free world,” a familiar term that can be more flexible than it sounds. Finally, his administration must address four key problems that this framing implies. A free-world strategy can help Washington prevent this century from becoming an age of autocratic advantage—but it raises pointed questions about who’s in, who’s out, and how to navigate a world that is increasingly divided and stubbornly interdependent at the same time.""",904e1683d113e03a33563f03858b2a9d1cfe246b,True,False,,,,,0,1653406585,,0,{},i9tgkfr,True,t3_uwtlup,False,True,t3_uwtlup,/r/geopolitics/comments/uwtlup/how_to_make_bidens_free_world_strategy_work_its/i9tgkfr/,1653406597,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653377785.0

Why? To protect free trade? Maybe containment is a productive tool for U.S policy but not these others. If Japan and South Korea was really keen on containing China, the U.S would have to force these alliances. South Korea and Japan are not friendly countries, but the U.S demands that they increase their military engagements. The U.S is constantly having military practices outside North Korea and China, and when these countries are doing the same in their own territories, the U.S starts saber rattling.

The  is U.S considering East Asia to be their own sphere of influence (Obama's ""Pivot to Asia""), all the while the U.S engaging in trade embargoes against China (which were not done of humanitarian reasons mind you). In the meantime the U.S having a schizophrenic relationship between China and Taiwan, constantly forcing China to restate that it considers Taiwan a part of China (just as Taiwan considers themselves to be the legitimate rules of China). Arming Taiwan is no problem sui generis, but the U.S makes it a problem by proclaiming it loudly, thus forcing China to constantly have to engage and respond. The U.S says that China ""can take Taiwan"", but don't really ask ""Do they want to take Taiwan""? So the U.S keeps the antagonism going.

This is another article by John McBeth about Indonesia's attempt to get better value for its mineral resources.  I have posted two of his articles in the last seven months about this.

1. [China building Indonesia into an EV powerhouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/str7dr/indonesias_valueadded_mining_policy_paying/)
2. [Indonesia’s value-added mining policy paying dividends](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/str7dr/indonesias_valueadded_mining_policy_paying/)

At the moment Indonesia EV / EV Battery projects have already started for LG, CATL, and Foxconn is expected to break ground in September. The total value of these three projects alone is worth US%25 Billion.

While the meeting with Musk seems encouraging, the Indonesians two months ago were about to give up because Tesla was asking too much. But they managed to get the project back on track.  They have been chasing after Tesla since 2020.

The Indonesian President visited Space X in the US after he finished US-ASEAN joint meeting with Biden.  The press in Indonesia, India, and Malaysia were more focused on Jokowi's meeting with Musk than his meeting with Biden. Here are some of the headlines

1. [All the ways that Malaysia, too, can woo Elon Musk](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2022/05/22/all-the-ways-that-malaysia-too-can-woo-elon-musk/)
2. [Indonesian president plans to meet Elon Musk over nickel](https://www.reuters.com/business/indonesian-president-plans-meet-elon-musk-over-nickel-minister-2022-05-09/)
3. [Musk Shifts Focus To Indonesia After Indian Ministers Fail To Tempt Him To Make Teslas In India](https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/musk-shifts-focus-to-indonesia-after-indian-ministers-fail-to-tempt-him-to-make-teslas-in-india-569715.html)

There is a gap in perception in the US among political and security types on the capability of ASEAN countries. The US government is donating 50 years of Coast Guard cutter to the Philippines, even though the Philippines has the 4th largest shipbuilding industry in the world after China, Japan, and South Korea. They built [passenger ships](https://www.ship-technology.com/news/austal-philippines-norwegian-ferry-operator/) destined for Europe. It is like still thinking the Philippines is still a 3-year-old toddler, but in reality, he is 12 years old already.

I found him well researched and very convincing. However, many of his predictions could be very easily altered by state actors taking either irrational or simply unpredictable actions (i.e. operating on knowledge we are not privy too). 

All in all, it sounds like Peter Zeihan is trying to do the best he can with the data he has to predict a geopolitical landscape that has currently entered a critical phase in its development. Before someone listens to this and concludes that China is a non-factor, Russia is destined to invade Romania and Poland before their demographics get too tight, and the US is likely to go full national populist, etc etc, keep in mind that a single peace treaty, declaration of war, election or coup has the capacity to impact (obviously it won't reverse demographic trends) the outcome considerably.",d6dedeb167a0b39c33f2c49febd256e9476fbf3a,True,False,,,,,0,1653365267,,0,{},i9rpo4y,False,t3_uw8sfn,False,True,t3_uw8sfn,/r/geopolitics/comments/uw8sfn/energy_at_the_end_of_the_world/i9rpo4y/,1653365279,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653336467.0
