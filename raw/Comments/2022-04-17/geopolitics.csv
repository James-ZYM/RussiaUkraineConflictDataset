Trump wanted countries like Germany to stop freeloading. Poland, Romania and the Baltics constantly improve their militaries and keep NATO's commitments, meanwhile German's army is so weak that Poland could seize Berlin in a week. 

The Donald finally armed Ukraine, after Obama failed to do so, because he was talked out of it by Angela Merkel. Trump also reactivated the missile defence program in Poland and Romania, which Obama also slashed to not provoke Putin. 
Finally, the Trump administration greenlighted F-35s and newest gen Abrams' tanks to the Poles, which Democrats failed to do. They also put sanctions on Nord Stream II and finally shook up the French and German leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a great deal of respect for China, but I am very scared of them and what the rise of China means for the future.

China has fundamentally different viewpoints regarding freedom of expression and the relationship between the individual and the state, than the Western world.  It is simply a far  more authoritarian country.  In my opinion, this is an aspect of Chinese culture, not merely an aspect of the current Chinese government.  I say this as someone who has traveled widely in China over the last 25 years and seen the changes there, and talked about them with many of the Chinese people.

My core values, on the other hand,  include a requirement for near absolute freedom of speech, large amounts of autonomy for the individual, and limited government.

The problem for me, is that China has shown their value system to be incredibly successful at providing economic prosperity.  It seems likely to me that they will eventually be in a position to impose it on the world.  That's a major problem for me.  I do not want, for example, a social credit score, that determines whether I can use a public restroom for free.  Nor do I want re-education camps for people whose only crime is to belong to the wrong religion.  Both of these things are a reality in China.

Russia, on the other hand, will never be in a position to impose its values on the world.  So, I do believe it was a strategic mistake not to reach a compromise over NATO enlargement with Russia.

As in, people do not conclude automatically that being non-Sunni makes you an enemy. It is slightly more complex. And this extends to states that have to cynically make alliances for benefit. 

There does remain significant majoritarian biases in modern Turkey, especially for the Alevis, driven by tensions concerning their non-conformity. However, at the same time its not every Sunni that attacking the Alevis., so its not likely to be something inherent to the Sunni theology that commands them to discriminate. So from what I am seeing it is not a case that every single area of life features religious discrimination, and some level of coexistence is possible, particularly in places where religion is de-emphasised.

They have, according to Wiki: 

- Liaoning - an ""aircraft cruiser"" of ex-Soviet vintage, more or less a training vessel pressed into service.  
- Shandong - a true carrier comparable in size to British Queen Elizabeth-class carriers, but way beyond top US carriers in tonnage.
- A third, yet to be named carrier in development which isn't that relevant right now.

&gt;their economy will be largest by that for sure and that will give them immerse power and funds to have navy larger than USN.

What?  No.  Not even close.  Maybe in 20 or 30 years if the US effectively ceases funding its Navy tomorrow like Russia has already done.  Carrier battle groups and blue water navies give the clear advantage to USN.  You can't just spend money at this and shift it in your favor.   

&gt;They will have superiority over sea and those who do rule the world as they can run and stop international trade, Look at British, US, Ming china, Arabs, Ottoman of the past.

Nobody except *maybe* the British has ran a blue-water navy like the US Navy in world history, especially with its firepower and its reach.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results but even China has pretty much zero regional allies.  You're writing off the US as it stands while also comparing defense expenditures over hundreds of centuries that are meaningless today.  

&gt;This war is allowing them to take over Russian economy that means that their oil and gas dependence in sea rout will be over, they dont need it as they already have bases all over world and get more bases as time goes by.

The Chinese are more careful than you think treating Russia as a pariah state/gas station.
