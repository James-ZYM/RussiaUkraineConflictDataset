I'm venturing into speculation here, but just yesterday there was an interview with the Austrian PM who had just met with Putin.

You'll know when the offensive actually starts because either the Russians will fire off an incredibly large artillery volley or else the Ukrainians will do it first as a spoiling attack (its highly likely SIGINT will tip the UAF when the offensive starts). 

There is a pretty large Russian reserve building up in Izyum, supposedly 22 BTGs and that includes the units that had been moved from the Kyiv front. Even if half strength (I doubt they're that bad) it still equates to a full divisions worth of tanks, IFV, and APCs, plus a shit ton of artillery, who are going to be focused on barreling down the E40 highway in the SE direction of Artemivsk, which will also be threatened by a western orientated advance from Popasna (though with far less forces). 

That's a 90 something kilometer objective, that will be HEAVILY defended by Ukrainian forces, likely possessing a defense in depth facing Izyum. If the Russians launch it before the mud dries they'll lose cross country abilities but they're still going to be able to mass fires from the BTGs, the brigade level artillery, independent artillery units at the division and CAA higher level. They've been staging all that ammo since they refocused on the Donbas front and they're going to use most of it as prep fires before the assault starts, at least if they bother following their own doctrine, which they should since its the only way in hell they have a chance to win. 

Its still stupid they aren't waiting until the mud dries. The Ukrainians know exactly which roads the Russians are going to advance down, and with shitty cross country capabilities it'll be so much easier to defend them when the Russians again try attacking down channelized kill zones (roads) in column formation. But then again, maybe the arty prep fires will actually do something.

This is why Russia attack also from the south and west/east of Kyiv.

While at the same time northern forces siege Kyiv from both sides and keep them busy. JFO would get cut off and without support. Unfortunately for Russians the only easy thing was taking Kherson (and there is a lot of indication it was because of a treason by a high ranking official in the region), everything else failed and northern forces had to retreat due to massive losses.

I disagree here. This is very reminiscent of the first two weeks of the war, where the general consensus was that Russia would eventually encircle Kyiv and Odessa. 

Creeping advances turn into stalls. Stalls require the Russians to sit tight and take casualties while they reorganize. Operational pauses become permanent because the UA can deplete units of supply faster than they can be reinforced. 

Maybe their plan is working better then before on some level, because they are closer to supply centers or because they have only 1 major axis of advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Takeaways**  
  
**Russian forces likely captured the Port of Mariupol on April 16 despite Ukrainian General Staff denials.**  
**Russian forces likely seek to force the remaining defenders of the Azovstal factory to capitulate through overwhelming firepower to avoid costly clearing operations, but remaining Ukrainian defenders appear intent on staging a final stand.**  
**Evgeny Prigozhin, financier of the Wagner Group, is likely active on the ground in eastern Ukraine to coordinate Wagner Group recruitment and funding.**  
**Russian forces continued their build up around Izyum but did not conduct any offensive operations.**

&amp;#x200B;

Also of note, quoted from it:

*The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 16 that the Kremlin is increasingly arresting Russian and proxy officers for failures in Ukraine.\[3\] The GUR reported Russian military authorities established a commission intended to run from March 2 to April 24 in occupied Horlivka to identify the reasons for personnel shortages among Russian forces. The GUR reported that Russian investigators discovered the commanders of Russia’s 3rd Motor Rifle Brigade was 100% staffed at the beginning of the invasion when it in fact only had 55% of its personnel and arrested two battalion commanders in the brigade. The GUR also reported the FSB arrested DNR Defense Spokesperson Eduard Basurin for his ”careless statement” on April 11 revealing Russian intent to use chemical weapons in Mariupol, though there is still no independent confirmation of the Ukrainian claim of Russian chemical weapons use.*

&amp;#x200B;

My commentary: We all kind of suspected what a mess it was. But if this is typical of their units, reform would be a very long process. In a world where Russia is essentially shooting with perhaps less than half their stated firepower in the first place, everything is a lot more in Ukraine's favor. Having 55% of personnel is about half - but that's before you even get into sub-standard equipment maintenance, equipment, etc, and poor command and control. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that the Ukrainian forces might be overall more effective person to person so long as they can contest air space, and they certainly outnumber the Russians if this is common. It also leads one to wonder at the loss levels proposed, if Russia is even closer to running on empty here.",3941523c7282d68b4d6ac00d023e5fa15f2ae0fe,True,False,,,,,0,1650230395,,0,{},i54op1t,False,t3_u5lm14,False,True,t3_u5lm14,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i54op1t/,1650230413,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650201595.0

Industry collapse and end of western trade followed by tons of wounded and traumatized veterans heading back to live in poverty with their only skills being related to looting.

I know it's a bit bandwagon-y, but all the numbers and stats I look at make the situation for Russia just look worse and worse and worse. Not even looking at headlines which are popular right now, just looking at raw numbers on inequality and demographics have been *dire*. And doing any analysis and prediction makes to look worse.

Just trying to imagine it, out of the Russians in Russia, about half are over 45. And the people under that age will have tons of ex-military with only real skills being looting. Tons of them grew up in western-trade heavy economic boom that aren't prepared for isolation. And with imminent economic troubles that will last years at least. Crime is likely going to be really, really heavily on the rise with all the problems that brings. Culture of corruption, inequality, and heavy drug use. It's gonna be bad. And this with the demographic crisis. A *lot* of elderly people that will not be taken care of, not a lot of options for economic growth.

They assume that at the least they'll get the southeast of Ukraine and it will be a rather purely profitable puppet state or annexed region that won't give them trouble or resistance. Then they seem to assume that trade will resume and the West won't do anything like reduce oil consumption or keep sanctions in place.

I'm just trying to figure out a way where things go *well* for Russia, and ultimately, it's the same thing over and over. Russia can get better if they pull out of Ukraine right now, it's an economic trash fire. And launch a huge rapid anti-corruption plan. Corruption is *also* an economic trash fire. This would involve totally restructuring their military and government systems. But their politics are so utterly rooted in corruption right now that you flat out need another government with no real continuity with the last to have any real hope of that.

&gt;The horrific scenes coming out of Bucha, Irpen and other Ukrainian cities (see EDM, April 13) “not only make [Russian President Vladimir] Putin a war criminal,” Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev says, but “show ‘the quality’ of the Russian army.” The soldiers who serve in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are so undisciplined and prone to criminal actions that they will pose a serious threat to the country itself once hundreds of thousands of war veterans return home, Inozemtsev argues. The behavior of the Russian military is not that surprising in one sense, the expert writes. After all, it was sent to fight by an organized criminal group, the Putin regime; and “if one such group steals, why should the other not specialize in murders?” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

&gt;But in thinking about the future, it should be obvious, he continues, that the several tens of thousands of Russian ruling elites will simply flee if and when Russia is defeated, whereas the much larger number of angry, traumatized, and physically and psychologically damaged veterans of the Ukrainian war will not. And the latter’s presence will bleed back into broader Russian society in horrific ways. Consequently, “even if Putin meets his next birthday in The Hague or does not live that long—and the chances of both these scenarios are growing today with unimaginable speed—the rapists, murderers and marauders will be returning to society and will significantly change its nature,” Inozemtsev says. The veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya were not as dangerous for Russia society: not only were there fewer of them and they came back gradually but also social norms at that point were better and exercised a greater influence on the behavior of veterans, he continues (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

&gt;Inozemtsev notes that Russian military commanders in Ukraine are either turning a blind eye to, encouraging, or even ordering the troops under their command to commit mass murder and atrocities. And this means “that even after the departure of Putin, the country will have to deal with the criminalization of society that he sponsored over several decades.” In comparison, he asserts, “the ‘accursed’ 1990s, will appear a model of gentlemanly behavior and decency” (Kasparov.ru, April 5).

&gt;A major reason for that fear is that ever more Russians are arming themselves. Even prior to February 24, 2022, when Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, some observers suggested there were as many as 25 million guns in private hands in the Russian Federation. Wars almost inevitably lead to a bleeding back into society not only of people accustomed to violence but of weapons that allow them to engage in such acts (see Monitor, July 21, 1995 and August 22, 1995). And in response to that threat, ever more Russians have been buying up guns and ammunition since February, fearful that international sanctions will limit their access to such defenses or raise prices enough to put weapons out of their reach, even if returning veterans-turned-criminals wield them freely (RBC, March 23).

&gt;The Russian government is now mulling new and more restrictive laws on gun ownership.

[],False,,Tony49UK,,,[],,,,text,t2_c38yc,False,False,"Aircraft carriers

Although the Montreux Convention is cited by the Turkish government as prohibiting aircraft carriers from transiting the Straits, the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000-ton limit imposed on warships, which makes it impossible for non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.

Under Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit [capital ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ship) of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship. In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry [observation aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_plane). Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were ""designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea"". The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.

The Soviet Union designated its [Kiev-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev-class_aircraft_carrier) and [Kuznetsov-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznetsov-class_aircraft_carrier) ships as ""[aircraft-carrying cruisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_cruiser)"" because the ships were armed with [P-500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-500_Bazalt) and [P-700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-700_Granit) cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the [Slava-class cruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slava-class_cruiser) and the [Kirov-class battlecruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirov-class_battlecruiser). The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the Convention, but at the same time, the Convention denied access to NATO aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000-ton limit.[[full citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include)] While the Soviet Union built its aircraft-carrying cruisers in the Black Sea, neither the Soviet Union nor Russia has ever based them in the Black Sea.

Turkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the Convention could leave Turkey with less control over the Straits, and the [UN Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea) had already established a more liberal passage through other straits. By allowing the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers to transit the Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.",97a10f91fda9fb2809081abc645f8069999cd2eb,True,False,,,,,0,1650219875,,0,{},i5409nz,False,t3_u5lm14,False,True,t1_i53zjrp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i5409nz/,1650219891,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650191075.0

&gt; Submission Statement

&gt; Author Ian Easton of the Project 2049 Institute asserts that any conventional invasion of Taiwan will be decided not on invasion beaches or in a battle for air superiority, but will swing based on whether or not the PLA can capture and hold the ports with the necessary infrastructure to offload heavy equipment.

&gt; An amphibious invasion of a mountainous island with nearly 24 million people would require a vast amount of men and materiel that could not simply wade ashore. The PLA would have to first capture beaches, then maneuver forces to capture ports with much of its infrastructure intact to be able to disembark armored vehicles, munitions, and other stores and heavy equipment. Easton examines which beaches may be most likely to be attacked, which ports have the necessary facilities to be useful to the PLA, and how these areas could be attacked and defended.

&gt; Don't be scared off by the 40-page PDF. Once you factor out citations, notes, images, tables, etc., the actual reading is less than 20 pages.

&gt; Russian forces additionally opened a new line of advance into northern Zhytomyr Oblast from Belarus, advancing roughly 20km into Ukraine toward Bihun and Ovruch as of noon local time on March 3.[12] ISW cannot currently assess the concentration of Russian forces on this new axis of advance. The Ukrainian General Staff reported two Russian BTGs are operating in Zhytomyr Oblast as a whole but did not differentiate between operations west of Makariv and new Russian advances across the Belarusian border.

The ISW in turn cites [this facebook post from the Ukrainian General Staff](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/263757872603965)

&gt;In the Volyn direction, the enemy with up to 2 BTGs moved to defensive operations and tried to stay on the border Bihun, Ovruch, Pirozhky, Rizniya, Ukrayinka.

That is the only thing ever listed about this front.

If you look at the 5 places mentioned, they form [this line](https://i.imgur.com/szusiAv.png). It seems likely to me that the general staff meant that 2 Russian BTGs were now committed to defending their flank, and they simply named 5 towns along this general direction.

This was likely then misinterpreted by the ISW, presuming that 2 new BTGs had been sent in along that axis, which wikipedia editors then took at face value, and changed the map. It stayed like that until the complete withdrawal.

Liveuamap also never had any Russian troops or events listed near Bihun or Ovruch, which confirms my suspicions.

If you were to ask me a few weeks ago id answer: ""Not a godman chance!"" Now... I'm not so sure.  


They did appoint a new overall commander which the news went crazy about. But real life isn't a video game. Just appointing a new overall commander dosent fix your existing logistics problems, morale problems, etc... Also considering his personality I doubt he will be inspiring anyone to be more happy to die than before. But the one thing he does do is provide strategic focus. Something that the Russians were lacking up until this point. Each unit was operating in isolation to other ones. Possibly that has changed...  


Its also been a few weeks and it seems that Donbas is at least a region where Russia isn't doing Absolutely awful. Its also closer to their domestic rail lines and existing supply system which means their engineer corps dosent have to work as hard to link up domestic and foreign supply trains.   


However...  


Even with all that said. The problems with the Russian army (like I mentioned above) aren't surface level from appearance but rather pervasive. They are inherent problems with their logistics and doctrine/existing deployment. So fixing them wont be easy and wont happen overnight but rather over a few weeks. The Ukrainians also are clearly expecting an attack like this and have been stockpiling and rationing heavy weapons and anti tank/anti aircraft for something exactly like this.  


Then there is the weather. It still hasn't turned to Russia's favor yet and will make their open field deep battle doctrine a lot harder to pull off. a lack of precision strike airborne weapons like cruise missiles and standoff munitions also means their pilots will need to get closer and lower to perform sorties precise enough to actually damage opposing forces. Lower operations ceilings will also expose said aircraft to short to medium range AA which could cause their losses to escalate again.  


Ultimately anything they do is likely to be highly costly even if they come out on top, and thanks to the above factors I doubt they will.   


Thing is... Russia is between a rock and a hard place. Every day they give their enemy makes the odds worse.

Upside of possessing nuclear arms is insurance against existential threats.  Downside is international condemnation and resulting isolation. 

If existential threat is clearly present, obviously the benefit of nuclear arms completely outweighs detriment of international sanctions.  I’d say U(nuke)  &gt;&gt; U(sanction)

When balancing these 2 utilities, one must consider the probabilities that these contingencies actually occur:

    U_total = U(nuke) * P(ex threat) - U(sanction) * P(int condemn) + other terms

The P value changes over time.  Back in 1990s, P(ex threat) was near zero, and P(int condemn) was near 1.  U_total was clearly negative. So it was right decision for Ukraine to give up nukes.

But today, things have changed.  P(ex threat) = 1 for sure.  I’m not sure P(int condemn) is near 1.  There is a precedence of a nation who faces insurmountable security challenges, and the champions of nonproliferation gave a ‘pass’ (or at least a blind eye) for going nuclear: Israel. I bet today if Ukraine developed nukes in secret, neither US nor EU would press nonproliferation issue too hard, especially if Ukraine were denied  NATO membership.

I would say today, U_total is firmly in positive territory for Ukraine.  Other countries not under nuclear umbrella should revisit this calculation.  

If the West still wants to preserve nonproliferation, then they need to work very hard to push P(ex threat) value to 0.",b2cea3272d4327662b7f49ec54695d0b186b7007,True,False,,,,,0,1650216151,,0,{},i53r66u,False,t3_u5f3x0,False,True,t1_i527s17,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5f3x0/why_the_ukraine_war_does_not_mean_more_countries/i53r66u/,1650216164,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650187351.0

&gt; The scale of an all-out Taiwan (Republic of China, ROC) invasion by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) military—the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)—defies human comprehension and would likely eclipse any historical comparison. In this important contribution to the field, Senior Director Ian Easton analyzes Chinese military studies frameworks and internal PLA documents to answer pressing questions that will help Taiwan and the United States both understand and better plan for potential crisis scenarios. He highlights the centrality of ROC port facilities—and Taiwan’s ability to defend them—in the PLA’s potential invasion plans for Taiwan, illustrating likely operational strategies explored by PLA leadership. In addition to postulating ports likely targeted in a PLA invasion, he provides recommendations that the Taiwanese government could undertake to ensure its port infrastructure security, as well as recommendations for the United States on how to be a supportive partner to Taiwan in that effort.

After stopping their offensive, German forces pulled back into prepared positions to reduce casualties and start a war of attrition in the west. A war of attrition makes economics, resources and politics much more important to a conflict than they are in a quick attack and conquer. 

To consider whether the German decision to go on the defensive was a success or failure, you need to consider the those factors more than just the size and equipment of the Armies involved.

There was no real threat of an operational level encirclement in Kyiv, only a small number of potential small localized flank attacks that if pressed might have cut off limited number of Russian units or inconvenienced them by making them take other routes. 

The Russians pulled out of that operational front because Kyiv itself was impossible to take without assault or siege, neither of which was possible to perform without massively reinforcing the three CAA and tank army assigned to the front with more forces taken from elsewhere in Ukraine. Since the entire point of taking Kyiv was as part of the initial ""Thunder Run"" strategic plan to try to topple the Zelenskyy govt, and since that was no longer a possibility at that point by simply taking the city, it made no sense to reinforce them. 

So the choices were: 1) change nothing and keep grinding away on a fruitless strategic objective. 2) partially evacuate the front to leave just enough Russian troops to tie up and pin Ukrainian defenders in that sector. 3) remove everyone to redeploy elsewhere. 

They chose the latter as part of a strategic mission shift to focus on Eastern Ukraine. It was a totally rational decision, the right decision too. Yep, still a major strategic defeat, especially since that was the strategic main effort up until that point, but not what you're making it out to be. It was the obvious answer at that point, if anyone halfway competent was asked what the Russians could do it better their situation in Ukraine, abandon Kyiv was no. 1, along with abandon any hopes of taking Odessa, which is why they pulled back totally to Kherson.

&gt;And if Ukrainians do take Antonov bridge and Russian do not escape... well that is even better for Ukraine.

How is that better? They still need to take the city which is on the west side of the Dnieper. That means an offensive attack in urban area, or a long siege and still a need to enter the city to round up defenders. 

After which the Ukrainians will have no means of crossing the Dnieper because they would have destroyed the only actual bridge in the area, which is why bridges aren't all destroyed during war, both sides need them.

&gt;So I do not see why Russians would hold onto Kherson if Antonov bridge came under threat

Every Russian brigade and above has organic bridging equipment, not to mention barges and the like. It would be a pain to try to bridge the Dnieper or reinforce by barges but it wouldn't be the first time the Russians did it in war, they did it in 1944. 

&gt;I do not see a reason why Ukraine would try to assult Kherson before trying to cut off the bridge.

I don't either. But can you can see them assaulting the city after the bridge is cut? Mariupol defenders were cut off too before the assault started, how did that go? 

Do the Ukrainian general staff seem intelligent? I think so. So what could be the reasons they aren't doing what you're recommending and just threatening one bridge to cause the total Russian withdraw from Kherson, their last bridgehead over the Dnieper? The UAF could have dropped the bridge with relative ease pretty much anytime since the war started, let alone just threaten it, but they didn't. Because it's way more complicated than how you're making it seem. 

That's my point, all I'm saying is this stuff is way more complicated than many Redditors are commonly making it out to be. There are no assurances in war, everything is a gamble that has the potential to lose as big as one can win.",aa4b6bc7f8374e54084a9b5ae263cb356e60deca,True,False,,,,,0,1650213092,,0,{},i53jry6,False,t3_u5lm14,False,True,t1_i53ajai,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i53jry6/,1650213104,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650184292.0

""Production of Russian SAMs on pause, factory workers are sent on vacation or to war

April 17, 2022 Production facilities of Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant (JSC UMZ, Ulyanovsk) have been shut down. UMZ is a manufacturer of short-range and medium-range radar systems and air defense equipment for the ground forces of the Russian Armed Forces (SAM Buk, SAM Kub, ZRK Tunguska).

The reasons for the critical state of production - the use of a large number of components and electronic components in the manufacture of military products. Until recently, the main supplier of the Russian military-industrial complex was Germany. But with the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, any cooperation was stopped.

According to employees, the plant is unable to continue production on its own, because ""almost nothing Russian"" is used during the technological process.

Currently, the plant's management is looking for opportunities to circumvent sanctions and establish supplies through third countries (including Kazakhstan). But such schemes lead to a significant increase in the cost of components due to the need to pay for services to intermediary countries. But this is not provided by the budget and there is no possibility to increase it.

Workers are given a choice: go on unpaid leave or sign a contract with the armed forces to take part in the war in Ukraine.

While I believe the UNSC needs reform you're right to be cautious. However when reform is impossible then the revolution is necessary. Of course ""who is next"" brings up other UNSC members, but TBH if they commit wars of aggression they should be punished. While I don't think the USA would get pushed out over IRaq (it was too long ago now) the precedent might even be enough to keep them from doing it again.

I am not going to go to bat for the USA, leave that to someone else, but if Russia gets kicked out of the UN over this, it would also be kinda funny for the US to get kicked out of the club it made. Both would eventually be re-admitted (following whatever conflict).

But then the damage would be done, it would be the dawn of a new day and we could seriously talk about reforming the UN into something more dynamic and not so held back by the vetoes of major powers.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"This article is written by Grau and Bartles whose work has been featured on this forum before. They are Russian military experts and they write about it often. 

I would recommend this article to anyone who is interested in better understanding the Russian military and the Russian way of war. It is not a war update built on shaky assumptions, it is instead a background piece written by two people who have spent their life studying Russia's military and how it operates. 

I personally did not know that this was a newer concept that has only been implemented on a mass scale in the last few years. Just ten years ago the Russian army would have been organized very differently in a large conflict. 

-------------

&gt; Success in modern conventional warfare is determined by a combination of effort, environment and – to an extent – luck. However, the most important determinants of victory are the actions of combined arms units. Only these units, in cooperation with other branches of arms and other military services, can perform the full spectrum of defensive and offensive tasks.

------------------

&gt; At the time of writing, details are still sketchy, but based upon media reports and a few captured Russian maps, it appears that Russia has conducted a partial mobilisation, deploying only partial divisions/regiments, brigades, and independent BTGs. Larger formations have apparently deployed only with their BTGs, leaving their other manoeuvre battalions in garrisons. Although the Russians appear to be having difficulties, this structural change was likely envisioned from the beginning of the operation, as the scale of the conflict is unsuitable for the sole use of independent BTGs. The BTG was ideal for earlier fighting in support of separatist ethnic Russian elements in Donetsk and Luhansk; however, large-scale combat requires large-scale combined arms operations and battalions fighting as part of larger entities.

-------------

&gt; In 2016, Russia had 66 BTGs; by 2021 it reportedly had 168.

----------

&gt; Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has made the term ‘Battalion Tactical Group’ commonplace beyond the expert community, from the mass media to YouTube and a plethora of blog sites. Though understanding of the invasion is still in its infancy, this article intends to shed some light on what a BTG is, and how it is used in a Russian military context.

--------------

&gt; The Red Army of the Second World War bled copiously and ultimately achieved a decisive victory against the bulk of the Wehrmacht. It was tactically inferior to the Reichswehr, but operationally superior. Russia has now focused on building a combat-ready, tactically and operationally proficient army to meet the requirements of changing demographics, political alliances and technology. This army is designed to employ regiments, brigades, divisions and combined arms armies in large-scale combat operations, in a conventional manoeuvre war, under nuclear-threatened conditions.

--------------

&gt; Every BTG is a combined arms battalion, but not every task-organised combined arms battalion is a BTG.

I don't think they have been that saturated considering the number of vehicles they have faced and could face.  If ATGMs strength is defensive and ambush (while still fine for offensive) then, if you are a smaller military, you would want enough that nearly every fighting force (military and civilian) had one available at their disposal and another to replenish.  As they aren't just useful for taking out tanks, but apc, ifv, technicals, fuel trucks, supply trucks, etc.  Being able to destroy logistics with ATGM has helped Ukraine immensely.

&gt;The ATGMs have to be maintained and they can end up being quite expensive.

I wasn't aware of this, I just figured they had a shelf life.  What sort of maintenance do they require/cost?

&gt;So would it be fair to say that the Tank isn't going away until the doctrine from one side changes to make them totally obsolete.

Having a night to think about it, I think what is important to the discussion, which I touched on briefly, is the evolution of the tank after this war.  The Germans started off WWII (and throughout) with faster more capable tanks, while specifically Britain had slower tanks meant to be infantry support for crossing trench lines (as it was in WWI).  Germany seemed to learn more from WWI and developed next gen weapons that would make previous style of engagement obsolete.  Britain on the other hand (and most of the allies and USSR IIRC) had to take time to catch up to this new style of warfare.

Not evolving tanks (and ATGM usage) after this conflict will put whoever is on the other end of someone who does at a clear disadvantage.",47f189b7aa1f3a03eaed76cac44519393fc1023a,True,False,,,,,0,1650206343,,0,{},i53410v,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i52n0jn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i53410v/,1650206359,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650177543.0

[],False,,BigBennP,,,[],,,,text,t2_bf6pl,False,False,"Well, at the beginning of the seige, estimates of the troops defending Mariupol ranged from about 14,000 down to 3000-4000.   Ukraine itself claimed they had about 3500 troops defending the city, with 800 of these being members of the Azov brigade. 

Just based on general troop numbers, it seems more likely the lower numbers were closer.   14,000 would have put roughly 10% of the Ukrainian active duty military encircled at Mariupol.   

The Russian order of battle with their forces being broken up into brigade tactical teams from different units makes it hard to assess how many troops are there unless you're keeping a theater wide tally, which I'm sure intelligence agencies are doing, but isn't something that you just see published usually. 

However, we do not that the bulk of the Russian 810th Marine Brigade (russian naval infantry) is present,  that would be about 2000 men and armored vehicles.   The Kadrovite brigade seems to have about 5000 men, and although some were deployed to Northern Ukraine (where a Kadrov column was destroyed near Hostomel), the bulk of their forces are around Mariupol.  The Somalia Battalion of the DPR is present and was 400-500 men.   Then you have significant elements of the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 8th Guards Combined Arms Army from the regular russian army.    


All in all, it's likely Ukraine had 3000-4000 troops defending the city, and Russia had 10,000-15,000 troops attacking it.    

Russia claims they have killed 4000+ and captured another 1400.     Ukraine isn't publishing military casualty figures for the siege but claims that more than 21,000 civilians have died.    

The russian casualties are a source of sheer speculation.  The only reason as much information about Russian casualties is coming out in the north is because many of them were left behind in the retreat.   Suffice to say they likely number in the thousands if not considerably more.   

Compare, in the second battle of Fallujah, the US/coalition deployed about 10,500 Marines, 2000 Iraqi security troops and 850 troops from the United Kingdom, and there were an estimated 3500-4000 insurgents in the city.     the US was likely far more careful and methodical than the Russians would be, and suffered 54 killed and 425 wounded in the most intense week of combat in November 2004.",86c5b2bf74bd31ce84f9709fe4ace2985ac05f3e,True,False,,,,,0,1650205785,,0,{},i532sbi,False,t3_u5lm14,False,True,t1_i52wauq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i532sbi/,1650205799,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650176985.0

If Germany had made an concentrated effort not to be overly reliant on Russian gas after 2014, we wouldn't be. The trouble with trying to connect it to nuclear is that the statement is true even without any changes in regards to nuclear power. 

It would have been possible to include nuclear plants in such an effort but to establish exiting nuclear as primary cause for the dependency you need to show that it would have happened if the exit was stopped.  One argument to point in that direction might be that it isn't possible to do it without. But I don't see strong indications to believe that is the case. Currently the German government states that is is possible to stop using russian gas by 2024. How that will work out in reality is an open question but it strongly indicates that it would have been possible during 9 years to reduce it to a great degree without nuclear. Also between 10 (pre fukushima) and 21 the production of nuclear dropped less than the production from coal. You might as well say exiting coal caused it. Now nuclear is preferable over coal of course, but we are talking only about causation not which routes would be preferable. 

More importantly sourcing it elsewhere is not influenced by nuclear so if there was a will but it just couldn't be done while exiting nuclear we should still have seen movement away from russian gas. The likely explanation is that the primary reason is a lack of political will not that it happened because of the Atomausstieg.

&gt;What makes you think that people cannot be knowledgeable about a specific issue? That's a very arrogant approach.

People can certainly be knowledgeable about a specific issue. I am concluding from statements about the gas dependency being because of the Atomausstieg (combined with not having seen any of them make a good argument to establish a causation), that the **specific people** making it are either not knowledgeable or motivated by something other than knowledge to make the statements. (Like really loving nuclear as solution and using any chance to advertise it.)

What has it been used for so far? Logistics, and maybe launching a cruise Kalibr from time to time. There are no carriers in the fleet (and Russians demonstrated an inability to use them in Syria). Cruise missiles have enough range and could've been launched from land (and indeed sometimes they are). The Odessa landing did not happen, and is looking less likely now. Slava-class ships have been built to destroy US carrier groups with nukes, which is a bit different from their use today. To rephrase my question: would a (slightly more) rational Russian autocrat, having taken power in 2000 and being intent on launching a full-scale war against Ukraine eventually, have been correct in a decision to scrap most of the Black Sea fleet and invest into land logistics, comms and aviation instead?

A lot of it is a crapshoot - which crewmen are where at what time, and whether or not a hit causes a cookoff.  For example, I believe the Belgrano was hit by two torpedoes - they say the first one didn't kill or wound a single man, but the second one exploded perfectly under the lunchroom during lunch - hundreds instantly dead.

We're yet to see any direct image of the damage (at this point it may require scuba diving to get any), so it's hard to speculate on how many sailors were killed in the initial hit.

&gt;All we know is there is video of the crew.

Well here are some other things we know or suspect:

We have satellite images (albeit scuffed) of the ship after the attack, still floating and swarmed by multiple rescue craft.  This, combined with the likely real footage of surviving crewmen in Sevastopol, can lead us to conclude that rescue **was** available.  Was it in sufficient quantity?  We don't know.  There were a lot of rescue ships around Moskva on that image, but their size and ability to assist are unknown.

We also have the pentagon's word that by their assessment it took Mosvka several hours to completely sink.  We don't know how they came to that estimate (we could theorize, etc) but since John Kirby chose to go on record I'm gonna guess they didn't use a Ouija board, that they had some physical evidence of that claim.  Either way that suggests there was a relatively long window for rescue.

Anyway, my guess based off these things we know or suspect, is that rescue was available in some reasonable quantity, and most of the casualties died or were wounded in the initial hit or any subsequent cookoffs.  Some may have not made it to lifeboats/rescue due to the ship semi-capsizing and trapping them (allegedly) or due to smoke inhalation, but I'm willing to bet that most of the people who died would have died to the attack or its immediate consequences, not due to lack of rescue.  This is similar to what happened on the Belgrano, though I'd argue that Belgrano's rescue was harder (it was the atlantic ocean, and no one even realized the Belgrano was hit for hours).",7b7d36ea8e0a2c0e789f8a4acb2f00845b61d896,True,False,,,,,0,1650195131,,0,{},i52jom0,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i52hs6g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i52jom0/,1650195143,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650166331.0

I’m a huge hobbies fan of military strategy n geopolitics and there are very few other ppl who share similar interests in my life nowadays. Me and my college roommate used to discuss this stuff all the time. 

I just happened to be reading thru old message chains of mine in this subreddit and I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it. I love learning new perspectives too and now that I’m reading this conversation again I’m kinda of tilting ur way on the overall opinion even though back then I was dead set in my opinion of the F35 as a quarterback   Or point guard. The sheer number of aircraft makes this a very compelling arguments.

Just to add to what ur view is 
1. F35s would have to make strike missions as self escort obviously as not enuf F22s and 4th gen escorts tagging along give away ur position. 

2. Ur right, they won’t hesitate to fire a quick salvo of 2 air to air missiles when they have a shot. Still got two in the tank for defense while hightailing back to safer zones after the salvo. I mean what good is the element of surprise if u never use it. 

3. They’ll still avoid getting in visual range of Su35s but if they do get in range it’s still 50 50 as missiles hav a harder time locking onto stealth plans and get thrown off by countermeasures better too. The Su35 is faster and has more armament and can outmaneuver but he would be visible from a huge distance and the F35 can preposition itself smartly.

4. Hitting tankers and esp those tiny mq25s is not gonna be as easy as the Chinese would be punching into American dominated skies to hit those. Even if u hit a few, they are replaceable. Won’t make a huge dent in sortie rates unless ur taking out a few everyday and to achieve that ur probably have to be denying air superiority over Japan itself too which is not happening. 

5. They’ll start degrading Chinese air defense infra from the perimeter using cruise missiles and bait and fire tactics using f35s. It would be dumb to use 4th gen aircraft to hunt Chinese ground air defense on the perimeter. the 4th generation would be used to bum rush weakened spots and draw out enemy aircraft probably

6. Air to air combat would mostly be beyond visual range anyways and stealth wins here almost always. The F35 has enuf passive sensors and awacs support to detect enemy aircraft without turning its radar on. Once it has a general idea, turn it on for a quick 30 second scan shoot and scoot would be the way.

7. Night ops. Things will be night ops for the first few weeks. Days ops will start on areas where enemy is already suppressed

[],False,,gl0riusLeader,,,[],,,,text,t2_1f9t05x7,False,False,"I think his main argument is that if Ukraine had in fact decided to keep those nukes back then, then it would force Russia’s hand to invade n conquer Ukraine within a few years of the Soviet breakup. During these few years , Ukraine won’t hav been able to convert those nukes into functional weapons. Any nuclear facilitation hav been bombed immediately. Not doing so would be extremely dumb for Russia. And in such a case world opinion would hav been firmly on Russia’s side as no one really wants to deal with another nuclear country .

Extrapolating this argument to the other extreme the author argues that other countries pursuing nukes will face a similar fate as described above. 
My own take is that he is kinda right unless ur already a sort of regional beast to the point that invading and conquering u during ur nuclear armament phase is not really an option. This is how it worked for India and then subsequently Pakistan(since Pakistan and unsaid Chinese backing for protection too). 

There is no doubt that once u get nukes, ur set for life. No need to worry bout ppl parking on ur yard. But getting nukes is the tricky part. Even Iran is struggling to tip toe that line even though it’s obvious that they can develop a bomb in less than a year if they really want to. The problem is that once it’s obvious that they are in the way, it will mean total war against them. 

Personally I feel there are very few countries today who can legitimately get away with transitioning into a nuclear state without catastrophic consequences. These would be
1. Japan : use chine as an excuse n crib bout how US might not be reliable 
2. Australia: same as above
3. Iran - I think they can do it honestly, jus gotta be willing to go thru a war for 10 years. As soon as they hav a few nukes n missiles, ppl gonna back off
4. Saudi Arabia (if iran gets it)- they already have in a way (they hav a deal with Pakistan)
5. Turkey - use Russia as a reason and crib bout NATO being unreliable to them(which they are)
6. Poland - crib bout the French n Germans being unreliable (which they are)
7. South Korea - though it would be dumb for them to do it , same as it would be dumb for Germany to do it

&gt; These multiple historical examples show that nuclear weapons do not deter all forms of aggression. So far, they do seem to have prevented truly existential threats from being carried out. But they do not necessarily prevent lower levels of conflict, especially over disputed territory. This suggests that a nuclear-armed Ukraine would probably never have experienced a Russian assault on the scale of the initial Russian invasion, where troops entered from three directions with the intent of taking the capital city of Kyiv. But in areas where Russia has contested Ukrainian possession, such as the Crimea and the Donbass, Russia’s actions might well have been the same even had Ukraine somehow equipped itself with nuclear arms. The use of “little green men” in Crimea or the arming of separatists in the Donbass are, after all, not very different from what Pakistan attempted in Kargil.

If there is a credible nuclear weapons expert that can make a rational argument that disagrees with them then I would love to read it. I will submit it myself even. 

He mentions the massive downsides and the likelihood that Russia would have seen this as a direct threat much earlier for example.

&gt; First, it is important to address the expressions of regret that Ukraine “gave up” a nuclear arsenal. There is a substantial element of mythmaking in this claim. Ukraine never had operational control of the former Soviet weapons. Instead, the ability to launch them remained in Russian hands. In addition, if Ukraine had somehow managed to wrest command and control of the nuclear weapons from Russia, it would have been hard pressed to maintain them. Ukraine had no defense infrastructure for manufacturing nuclear weapons, including no ability to produce tritium, which must periodically be replaced in order to keep nuclear fusion warheads functional. The claims that Ukraine could have prevented Russia’s aggression ignore the fact that Ukraine never actually had a usable nuclear deterrent.

&gt; Moreover, if Ukraine had attempted to seize control of the weapons, this would have changed Ukraine’s future for the worse. Russia would have regarded this as a serious threat to Russian security, and armed conflict with Russia might have come about much sooner, with Ukraine even less prepared to resist. A Ukrainian attempt to become a nuclear weapon state would also have alienated the West. Ukraine would not have been welcomed as a potential member of the community of democratic nations and would instead have been treated as a pariah state like Iran. In addition, had Ukraine not signed the NPT, it would have lost access to nuclear fuel and technical assistance needed for its civilian nuclear power plants, which provide much of the country’s electricity.

&gt; Other historical examples also make it clear that possessing a nuclear arsenal is no guarantee against being attacked. In October 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel despite being well aware that Israel had by that time obtained a nuclear capability. The two aggressors were motivated by desire to regain territories they had lost in the Six Day War in 1967—the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt’s case and the Golan Heights for Syria—and their military assault did not threaten Israel’s existence, but even so Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan broached the possibility in government deliberations that Israel might need to use its weapons of “last resort.” In 1982, Argentina launched a military assault to try to seize the Falklands Islands (which it called the Malvinas). Although located off the coast of Argentina, the islands were British possessions populated by English citizens. The war did not threaten the British Isles, but the fact the United Kingdom had nuclear weapons and Argentina did not clearly produced no hesitation in Argentina’s willingness to attack a British possession.

My guess is they're about to launch an offensive soon, probably an attempt to destroy the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk salient. That's not going to end the war at all but if it works it gives them an operational victory big enough they can claim it as a major success. It'll have the possibility of netting a large number of UAF forces in an encirclement. It'll straighten their line, making it shorter, allowing them to pull forces off the line to mass in reserve, to either use elsewhere or to allow them to reconstitute. And if it works they can have it done before May 9, Victory Day, a big propaganda win.

Of all the units that were in Kyiv Sumy fronts a bunch are fucked up, some more than others. We know certain units, like from the VDV, were being moved to south of Kharkiv, which would be the staging area for the northern prong of a double envelopment. VDV are there best troops, their most professional, elite, the ones least likely to succumb to motivation or morale issues as others would with lower tier troops and leaders.

After all, all the other Russian forces in that area have also been fighting non-stop since Day 1, and at least the VDV and anybody else haven't been on the front line since they retreated weeks ago, so they still got a break even if it was a short one to conduct transportation to another front.

There were roughly a dozen or so US Army and Marine generals in Iraq during the invasion, a few were close to the front regularly, but the Iraqi military lacked the ability to defend itself let alone find and kill senior officers. So otherwise it came down to chance and we didn't lose any KIA, I don't think any were even wounded. 

I do remember reading how General Mattis regularly exposed himself during the invasion and occupation to the point that he greatly endangered his Personal Security Detail (bodyguards for battalion commanders and higher), though that's their job.

Going further back the US Army didn't suffer this issue badly even in WW2 largely because the Germans lacked the means to find/kill our senior officers. And that was when the three and four star generals were outright telling the one and two star generals to expose themselves more as they too were expendable. In the Pacific, it went similar, it was rare for the Japanese to be in a position to kill a senior general besides luck, though Buckner made their jobs easy standing in the open with a pair of binos surrounded by his entourage at which point the Japanese called artillery directly on him.

The German general officer corps suffered terrible casualties in the war mainly from Allied air strikes, jabos strafing HQs and staff cars whenever they found them while prowling behind enemy lines. Similarly the Red Army suffered likewise, in addition to losing many during encirclements. 

In WW1, the British Army general officer corps suffered horrendous casualties because they made a point to share the burdens and regularly inspect the front lines, and had a habit of not taking cover like their men (to demonstrate a lack of fear and to prevent their men from being suppressed easily).",cc9eb0ad5cf4526373b6e96540e64160288563ea,True,False,,,,,0,1650170326,,0,{},i51nzol,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i50c2y8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i51nzol/,1650170340,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650141526.0

Selected quote:

&gt; An analysis that takes into account the full balance sheet of pros and cons from both Ukraine and earlier cases does not lead to a persuasive argument for nuclear proliferation. Commentators who trumpet the Ukraine war as an example of the value of nuclear weapons offer misleading advice that could end up weakening nonproliferation norms that have greatly benefited humanity.

--------------

On the topic of Soviet nuclear weapons left over in Ukraine after the Cold War:

&gt; First, it is important to address the expressions of regret that Ukraine “gave up” a nuclear arsenal. There is a substantial element of mythmaking in this claim. Ukraine never had operational control of the former Soviet weapons. Instead, the ability to launch them remained in Russian hands. In addition, if Ukraine had somehow managed to wrest command and control of the nuclear weapons from Russia, it would have been hard pressed to maintain them. Ukraine had no defense infrastructure for manufacturing nuclear weapons, including no ability to produce tritium, which must periodically be replaced in order to keep nuclear fusion warheads functional. The claims that Ukraine could have prevented Russia’s aggression ignore the fact that Ukraine never actually had a usable nuclear deterrent.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"That's not what's happening. What ISW was writing about is some Russian units that were known to have fought in the Kyiv front have since been spotted around the Kharkiv/Donbas front. Instead of leaving them in Belgorod for a few weeks/months to reconstitute, they sent them right back into battle or are staging them in the immediate area for a coming offensive. 

The way Russians traditionally reconstitute units is to pull them off the line into the rear by replacing them entirely with a unit coming from the reserve. The battered unit then enters the operational reserve, maybe for months maybe just a week, and that's when replacements arrive, soldiers discharged from hospitals rejoin their units, they get time to do maintenance, they get new equipment and vehicles to replace losses, hot showers and hot chow, maybe some time to do some retraining on theater specific subjects, as well as R&amp;R for the troops to go to whore houses and get drunk, etc. At that point, they're ready to go back into the line to relieve another unit or to be massed for an offensive. 

By not doing this, the Russian brass are knowingly sacrificing the long term well being of these units and their men, a very finite resource, increasing the chances of psychological casualties, hurting morale, and accepting a stark drop in combat performance. Either they're willing to make that sacrifice because they're desperate for manpower. Or they can't spare them even for weeks because they need them in the near future, like for an offensive they're about to kick off. 

These types of ruthless decisions have been made many times in history by every major military power. In the end the validity of their choice will come down to whether it worked. If the Russians win a coming victory, then it was a brilliant decision. If they don't, they're idiots who made a foolish mistake.

Me: &lt;chews SWO pin&gt;

&gt; We have more danger from fatigue right now than from foreign threats, and we can use this time to improve automation so it's more reliable.

I know this is a US Navy specific argument, but - that's not at all how the US Navy rolls out automation. The automation is approved, **the sailors that are removed by the automation leave**, then the automation is installed.

It is workload agnostic - the Navy is so desperate to cut budgets (and manpower is a big, juicy target) that when improvements are installed the operators/maintainers are *already gone*. The crew is still calculated for a full workload, **assuming the untested automation works perfectly out of the box**.

Any guesses on what happens when automation **doesn't** work perfectly out of the box?

I'm not trying to be confrontational here - this is the viewpoint that I would expect most outsiders to have about shipboard operations. But the lived experience of the last 30 years has been very different.

The only thing that reduces workload on current sailors is more sailors. (And maybe proper maintenance funding, but that's another diatribe for another day).

And it's the smallest of nits to pick, but - none of the crew are in any position to 'improve' automation, while they are being 'saved' from exhaustion; those systems are designed, authorized, and maintained at the Naval Sea Systems Command level. If the ship is *extremely* lucky there's a troubleshooting manual that comes with the install, or maybe a few days of training.

The question he should be asking is at what cost/benefit (resources, time) does a certain level of armor provide a direct cannon fired vehicle versus that of other methods of protection.  He further argues APS can't protect against multiple hits because their magazines are too small.  However, what is the cost/benefit of spending more (resource/time/weight) on APS having larger ""magazines"" versus that of put towards physical armor.

His argument that a tank can drive up on a berm, fire two rounds, and take out 2 vehicles thus is better, seemed to ignore his previously stated possibility of a lighter vehicle, only saying heavy vehicles like tanks can knock down trees.

The example survivability of taking multiple hits are against, to my knowledge, are against much less lethal systems (compared to western systems being deployed in Ukraine) by far less trained infantry.  This is like saying because a cat could survive in a fight against a chihuahua it has an equal chance against all other dogs.

His argument that the tank can't be replaced is made solely made in a binary tank/no tank scenario and fails to address how moving forward, what weapon systems provide similar effectiveness as tank systems for equal cost.

Could you have two light vehicles with large caliber cannons for the same cost as a single tank?  Can using less (rather than none) tanks reduce the support costs/logistics compared to other systems?  Is a tank better used with two light high caliber cannon vehicles than one other tank?  APS isn't just necessary for tanks, it is just as important for infantry and other vehicles.  By spending more resources on APS can you have a higher rate of return for cost/benefit?

Overall he begins the video mentioning doctrine, but fails to ask some of these questions.  What have we learned from this conflict as to what military doctrine should change and what changes to the doctrine necessitate change in equipment.  Again this isn't a binary question of equipment, but a hydraulic shift of the types of resources and training to better prepare for the next generation of conflicts now that we have more experience on how older doctrines/systems perform.

Even his argument about the countries that had tanks they tried to phase out completely ended up ""needing"" some fails to recognize that the Netherlands is a NATO country and would have to maintain tanks/crew as part of NATO doctrine, thus isn't an argument for the necessity of the tank systems.

His next argument is to counter the question the wisdom the older generation of tanks are now made obsolete, fails again the question of cost/benefit of what older tanks cost, versus that of buying newer anti-tank systems.  Probably on the earlier incorrect evaluation that ATGMs have a lower success rate in the field and tanks can take multiple hits.  The better question is spending resources on developing better ATGMs systems (to increase hit rate) outweighed by the cost/benefit of maintaining those older more troublesome tank systems.  Additionally, all those tank systems need parts for maintenance.  Should you get in a conflict with that supplying nation or that nations supply line suffers (war with another nation or like covid) will that put you at a severe disadvantage.

In this specific case, the weight of cost would be on either larger stockpiles of foreign ATGMs that would presumably be far less costly for maintenance or supplanting/supplementing with domestic production of an ATGM system.

He tries to assert that lots of ATGMs are not good for offense (as a counter argument for some of the above) but does not really elaborate as to why (especially when it seems ATGMs can be effective on offense as by information in Ukraine ATM).  Additionally, if placed in a defensive war that may be slightly surprising (as lower wealth nations have less surveillance capability) stored tanks (outside or underground) are more likely to be taken out quicker in sets of first strikes than the potentially larger number of ATGMs systems as they could be more plentiful, more spread out, and stored in a wider variety of locations thank tanks.

What he does get right is all of these weapon/doctrine systems are part of a larger whole.  However, ultimately his argument of ""why tanks aren't going away"" is pretty weak.  Not that you can't make an argument as to why tanks aren't going away, just needs better arguments for ""why tanks need to stay"".

I slightly agree with his final statement that is roughly ""its too early to tell"", but still think he misses the larger question which is what changes based on what we have learned thus far?

To me the biggest answer is that no country has an adequate supply of anti-tank, anti-air, anti-ship portable weapons and systems, irregardless of the questions about tanks.  

IMO, for what we have learned about tanks in regards to the threat of ATGMs in this war is less about the necessity of armor and more about one, the ""stealth"" of future tanks.  And by stealth I mean systems either on the tank or supporting the tank that reduce the chance the tank is to be seen/targeted/hit.  Then two, the level of remote operation of tanklike systems.  Can nearby (as in a few miles from vehicle) infantry operate stealthy tanks?  

I would imagine some things I've seen as very tiny, low profile drone tanks (a gun on tracks) could provide similar direct fire capability of of a tank, with some of its survivability (as it doesn't have crew inside) being quite cost effective.  The system wouldn't put crew at direct risk and could potentially swarm defensive positions if you could produce/operate them in significant numbers over current tank systems.  This is a senario that these minitanks are heavily resiliant to infantry with mass ATGMs as they would be more difficult to find, harder to target, and likely equally problematic to accurate hit.  However, that is all speculation based on some proposed developments I've seen over the years.
