The brain drain on Russia has been occuring for over a century.  
Anyone that does not toe the current regime line is sent to prison.  Education is used to inspire loyalty.  Those with talents that seek change have two paths to choose from.  Change Russia from within.  Travel aboard and find success somewhere that is nice already to build a family. 
That is where genetic memory kicks in. Slavic people often have a strong sense of family.  Girls will marry themselves off to suitable enough wealthy middle-age or older men to smuggler there entire family to the husband country.  Men and women learn technical trades and gain entery economy.

I’ve thrown plenty of phos grenades and they just cover everything burning phosphorus but don’t create a blast that would make a crater. We couldn’t take them back to the uk so after the war phase was finished we went out to the desert and threw loads of them as well as other munitions we had.

Just do a search on ""Moldova"" or ""Transnistria"", for instance. My guess is you could use it as a source for ""Georgia"" or ""Nagorno-Karabakh"", etc.

Jamestown appears to be a throwback - an old-fashioned US national-security conservative think tank focused on such areas.

So, absolutely, some of its pieces are a bit turgid, and there's a consistent Zbigniew Brzezinski/Henry Kissinger/Cold War Warrior flavor to them, but there's also a level of detail about the dynamics in these countries that I have been unable to find elsewhere.

It's Moldova that's historically reluctant, but with polling increasing gradually upwards over time - I am not aware of polling since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but I'd assume that acceptance of reunification has increased yet further as a result.

But a lot of that reluctance may be because a ton of Moldovans have left Moldova since independence, plus up to a million have gained Romanian citizenship (if you can show historic ties between your family and Romania, gaining Romanian citizenship is not hard - and then, of course, you're good to go anywhere in the EU).
