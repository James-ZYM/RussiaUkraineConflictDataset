It does because they are part of the legitimate government of Ukraine.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dehumanizing the enemy by calling them orcs (a term which in its own origins is mired in racism, but we'll assume most people miss that subtext) may be understandable. But it's also a dangerous line of thinking of people as, well, not people and therefore not worthy of the same rights. See also cockroaches and other dogwhistles.

We are talking about Russians who are deliberately murdering little children and elderly people.  Russian troops deliberately targeted the maternity hospital and theater in Mariupol.  The Russian pilot who targeted the theater saw the word CHILDREN in big letters and he dropped the bomb on it with glee so that he could get back to superiors and discuss the hundreds of little Ukrainian kids he killed.  He was probably decorated with an award by Putin for killing little children in Mariupol.  But of course, the most important thing isn't the evil war crimes that the Russians are perpetrating, it is that the victims said mean words about the people who killed them.  What great pro-Russian Nazi concern trolling you are involved with!!  Let me guess that the little children in Mariupol weren't bombed.

Sorry, but I'm tired of the concern trolling by clear pro-Russian accounts like yours.  How dare you advocate in favor of people who willingly murder little children and a society that covers it up.  They are Putin's Willing Executioners.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You did not address the continued presence of far right extremists within the institution of the military/territorial defense itself. They may be marginal, but as I stated their views are getting a lot of sympathy right now. And they are being armed.

The Ukrainian military is a good and professional military and extremism isn't that big a deal.  Only Russia thinks it is because they don't want the Ukrainian military to get weapons.  It makes it easier to kill Ukrainian babies without the men with weapons shooting at them after all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And 100%, I think Zelensky will face serious threats to continued rule from hardliners who will say this never would have got so far if they were in power, because they wouldn't capitulate to Russian demands.

If Zelensky makes a deal (which is highly unlikely), the hardliners can challenge him in 2024 and defeat him in a free and fair election.  They don't need to kill him for that.

Powerful broad spectrum signal jammers are low-tech and cheap to make, and every column of vehicles ought to be carrying a couple, or have a radio set that can double as one. More precise signal jamming should be available too. A properly digitally enabled army would be able to triangulate signal sources on the fly at the push of a button and direct mortar, tank, artillery, or aircraft fire at the source without exposing themselves to ambush. Not that difficult to do in theory, but if you're not equipped and trained to do these things, you have a problem.

Counters to these counters can be employed as well, of course, for example, by not communicating with your drones in real time and only getting the data once it lands, or using anything radio-enabled as remotely as possible, communicating over a wire or with line-of-sight laser or microwave.

submission statement:   The Economist takes a look at repressive nature of Putin's rule at home.  
Headline/byline:
&gt;The Stalinisation of Russia: As it sinks in that he cannot win in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is resorting to repression at home

summary: 

&gt;To understand the scale of Mr Putin’s lies, consider how the war was planned. Russia’s president thought Ukraine would rapidly collapse, so he did not prepare his people for the invasion or his soldiers for their mission—indeed, he assured the elites that it would not happen. After two terrible weeks on the battlefield, he is still denying that he is waging what may become Europe’s biggest war since 1945. 

(Seems to be free / limited - but The Economist will require creating an account).

Every day, the Wests ability to decouple from China while doing less self-harm grows. The West has grown complacent in many ways, but many people continually underestimate how ruthless it can still be to protect the liberal international order. I think, particularly if there is an actual prolonged conflict over Taiwan because the CCP miscalculates and the invasion stalls, then sanctions could be sudden and brutal. How much trading will the West do with a country it is actually engaged in direct military conflict with?

So is China invaded Taiwan, I expect sanctions every bit as tough as those that hit Russia. If there is actually conflict, rather than a quick victory over Taiwan that China tries to pass off as a fait accomplit, then a blockade may happen. 

It is impossible to guess what China will do. But it increasingly seems likely that the CCP only gamble on Taiwan if they believe that China is naturally going to stall out or even implode economically, and that they want to grab Taiwan and then go into a Maoist-like retrenchment period for decades until the world forgets and forgives them. 

Otherwise, so long as China still has big dreams, those dreams are best pursued by keeping the West divided and not antagonizing it, hoping for some good Chinese luck like tech breakthroughs, or that China just outlasts the West somehow.

Also you'll also need to live in that region for several years.  You've chosen terrorism.  Now choose a region you actually want to devote a good chunk of your life to.  

Some options to learn a language and live in the region.  Assuming you are an American.

-National Security Education Program: https://www.nsepnet.org/AboutUs.aspx
Language training and work requirement

-Foreign Service Officer via Dept of State: Start by taking the exam and it if you get through the process for the political cone, you'll get language training and a job overseas to start.  Your first posting depends on the needs of the Department but you can state a preference, and subsequent assignments you bid for.  Language training and a job.

-CIA: Language training for those going into the field and some opportunities for language training for analysts though for analysts they would prefer you already had some language training.  Language training and a job.

-Or go directly to graduate school and then become a Presidential Management Fellow.  Pursue a position as civil service with DoD, State, etc.  Especially from DoD, rotations possible  with NSC, Joint Chiefs, NATO.  Former PMFs include the current Dep Sec of Defense.  A job but no language training and you'll be in the DC area.  Many current think tankers are former PMFs.

-Or go military and apply to the Foreign Area Officer's Program.  Graduate school and language training provided. Deployment overseas.  You need to be in the military prior to application.

-Part of terrorism research involves following the money.  Many international banks offer early career/management training programs.  Some focus on recruiting MBAs but many don't.  Search for Standard Chartered, HSBC, etc.  These programs will train you often in credit analysis then assign you rotations in commercial banking, treasury management, foreign exchange, trade finance and the ins and outs of moving money around the world.  Just to be clear, I'm  not talking about investment banking.  Especially with international banks you'll have many opportunities to be based outside of the US.  No language training but a specific knowledge base that could be very useful in terrorism research.

You can stay in government or leave after a number of years for political consulting or a  think tank.  The above options provide a paid opportunity to learn a  language and live abroad while employed. Those positions will also provide experience, credibility and networking opportunities to achieve your professional goals. A good chunk of those in think tanks and political consulting, especially in DC, come from the above backgrounds.

All doors are open for you at your age.  Don't make excuses.  Choose what you want and do it.",907413a6d2a292c766872192dabf3c5fd1b4dbce,True,False,,,,,0,1647708780,,0,{},i1as2r8,False,t3_thtdjj,False,True,t3_thtdjj,/r/geopolitics/comments/thtdjj/which_region_should_i_choose_to_specialize_in/i1as2r8/,1647708794,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647679980.0,[],text,t2_3aaho4wc,False,False,

When I was working in think tanks (security more broadly, not specifically terrorism) the most sought after analysts were either ones with specific language skills (mostly Russian, Chinese, French, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu) or those with quantitative skills (Python, R etcetera). You could choose the latter and try to specialise in a region later. Moreover, it will make you more competitive for jobs outside of the security field in case you change your mind about it later.

It is also possible that whatever is sought after now is different in 5-10 years. Already we see a certain shift from e.g. Islamic terrorism to far right groups. Given the recent events in Ukraine and US withdrawal from Afghanistan, I would also not be surprised if security (research) budgets shift more towards traditional national defence research.

As for the engagement with Russia, that seems a bit murkier to me. I am no expert. I do believe some people were sincere in the belief that engagement prevented war. But I also think some elite Germans either thought that the current liberal order was ultimately unsustainable, or even that it was undesirable due to resentment of US influence. So there ideas about a German-Russia strategic core for a new kind of world. 

At least these people were thinking big picture. If the oceans were no longer policed, where does Germany get needed resources? Ah. Russia. Etc.

This is one of those things where the very best analysts don't choose a region, a region chooses them. As someone once said to me, and I couldn't agree more, you have to have a real love-hate relationship to be any good at area studies. You have to love it so much that you want to become completely immersed in it. However, you have to loathe it with such passion that you don't have any illusions about it. This can't be faked. It is who you are. And this follows through to your language skills, which are vital. In my experience, and unless you have a natural gift for languages, it is incredibly difficult to will yourself to learn a language. You have to really want to do it. This is the love part again. 

Have a sit down and think where your passion really lies. If you are going to do this seriously, it is going to take many years to build up your credentials to the point that you are seen as an authoritative voice on the region you cover. Try and travel a bit. See where grabs you. Of course, you can just pick an area for career purposes. But not one serious and well-respected analyst I have ever met who has risen to the top of their field has done it like that. It's always been something they have really felt inside.

Also, in terms of your topic of focus, you are actually better off being a generalist. Start with really understating a country or region. Then the reasons why specific issues, such as terrorism, exist start to become apparent. But you may also find other areas interest you. This can open up different paths. If you want to work for a foreign ministry, being a generalist who can answer a wider range of questions - such as relationships between political leaders, background to political parties, social divides, etc. - is absolutely vital.

FWIW, in my case, my passion is South East Europe - specifically Cyprus. I first went there when I was 18 and immediately fell in love with it. I ended up living there for eight years. (I also lived in Greece.) I wanted to know everything I could about it. I learned Greek - and some Turkish. 30 years on, I still think of it as my second home. I've worked with governments and international organisations and have been involved in UN peace talks. I miss the food and the weather. And I still have close family and friends there.

If we compare to the invasion of Iraq since the forces involved are on a similar scale where the defenders had fairly large, well equipped armies but fighting against a superior foe. In Iraq, US and UK airforces crippled their Iraqi counterparts and had impunity to dominate the skies and support the ground offensives. In Ukraine the Russian airforce has been virtually a non-factor, whether that is from fear of SAMs or general ineptitude of the VKS, meaning that ground forces have not generally been able to call in fast air to clear entrenced positions or support against Ukranian armour. 

Russia has also not been massing its armour in mass offensives but sending units piecemeal into combat. During Iraq, coalition forces sent massive armoured fists of tanks and IFVs supported by infantry to take objectives and utilised amphibious and airborne assaults to take key ports and oilfields. If Russia had done this in their initial invasion they could potentially have taken Mauripol and Odessa before defensive forces were assembled. Similarly if that 40km column of Russian forces that people kept talking about heading to Kyiv had been replaced by a strike force of heavy armour and mechanised infantry they could have reached the city in under 4 hrs from Belarus's border. They may not have taken it that quickly but modern warfare requires quick strikes to break an enemy's will to fight since urban conflict is so slow and dangerous for the attacking forces to slog through. But the way Russian logistics seem to opperate its likely they would have ran out of fuel on the way.

As I mentioned in a previous reply (and this is opinion) fascists of all stripes are above all, cynics and pragmatists. They know how to bide their time. 

If you take in more than the western narrative, in particular the wealth of raw footage coming from inside Ukraine, I can't see how anyone could not conclude what a huge mess it is on the ground. Ukrainian resistance doesn't seem a unified effort in an organised sense.

As for the tartars, their story is long and sad. Crimea is home to them and their history obviously makes them easier bedfellows with Ukraine than Russia.

Ultimately, not meaning to insult you, i think it's naive to think that the incorporation of the azov brigade (as an example of the Ukranian govt getting into bed with Nazis - remember this happened long before zelensky was elected and certainly Ukraine isn't a nation of fascists) was anything more than a marriage of convenience, but I would point to the morphing of the mujahedin into the taliban as an example of where this could go,  if a stable peace isn't won in the negotiating room.

Russia is a similar case in that it has a huge population that would massively influence the EU parliament, has a poor domestic human rights record and antagonistic relationship with Western Europe. 

The former Eastern bloc states would oppose Russian membership to limit its influence over them since based on population Russia would have just 3 seats less in the EU parliament than Germany and France combined, making them the power of the EU; France and Germany wouldn't want to lose their seats at the head of the table by allowing entry to a player that dwarfs them. 
Finally, unless Russia was to remove the corrupt power of the Oligarchs, massively reduce the scale its armed forces and tear down its political structures to begin anew, further integrating Russia into the EU economy would be disastrous if Russia embarked on another territory grab into its neighbours lands since sanctions would be just as crippling to EU nations that may come to rely on Russian trade.",5d4024cafb7d451a5d8895e90ecaa6171952bd52,True,False,,,,,0,1647701785,,0,{},i1abjjw,False,t3_thevro,False,True,t1_i17ksbu,/r/geopolitics/comments/thevro/the_eu_should_offer_association_status_to_ukraine/i1abjjw/,1647701801,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647672985.0,[],text,t2_5x44vys7,False,False,

However, I don't think that this will extend to discrimination against the Russian minority in Ukraine.  A reminder that Ukraine's beloved President is a member of that Russian-speaking minority.  If anything, this will help forge a new Ukrainian identity and history.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Plus the Ukrainian government is not some huge, modern military with a standing army ready to fend off Russia. They are having to deputize local militias, some of which have these extreme political views.

Ukraine has an excellent, modern army that has been trained well by the Americans.  I've seen videos and they are very good.  The local ""militias"" in question were important in 2014 at stopping the Russians.  Over the past eight years, the militias have been integrated into the Ukrainian military.  They make up a small portion of the total military.  And while the ideology of some is concerning, this is also a concern in the US with the American military and police.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;These views, just like the weapons, will not magically disappear even if Ukraine does ""win"" this conflict. The government, if it survives, will have to contend with and try to tame these extreme chauvinist sentiments and ask them to give up their weapons.

Right now, the weapons are being given to the military and territorial defense forces.  Ivan, the Farmer, isn't armed with a Javelin and a Stinger.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It's much more likely the extremists win democratic elections immediately following any peace because public support for their views will never be higher, and they can use their weapons to intimidate more peaceful factions.

Does anyone think that anyone other than Zelensky and his party are going to be winning elections in Ukraine in the near future?",e272b2d64a7df54d2413b47ca1a136ed68011104,True,False,,,,,0,1647697378,,0,{},i1a2eqa,False,t3_th3svd,False,True,t1_i1801i5,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i1a2eqa/,1647697394,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647668578.0,[],text,t2_f1tl112,False,False,

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,,,,"&gt; I wrote an article in January where I reached that exact same conclusion.

Caution should be exercised for any strategy or method to pursue foreign policy objectives. But wholesale rejection of a method (arming opposition forces) based on purported failure ""from Albania in the 1940s to Afghanistan in the 1980s"" is unreasonable.  

The article alleges that ""out of 35 U.S. attempts to covertly arm foreign dissidents during the Cold War, only four succeeded in bringing U.S. allies to power.""  I am only left to guess what that means, but at least these points should be obvious: regime change is rarely the goal and even if it was, ""bringing . . . allies to power"" involves considerably more than placing arms in the hands of some opposition force.  

Considerably more ""attempts"" to place weapons in the hands of the USSR's enemies occurred during the Cold War.  Nearly all such instances were oriented towards something other than regime change, but to prevent foreseeable massacres by more powerful actors. 

At the time, I argued against arming anyone in Syria, despite considerable domestic political support for doing so.  There, other means were better suited towards achieving American objectives (at least to the extent the foreseeable costs of pursuing them were justified by probable benefits).  

Furnishing arms, as was considered at that time, involved uncertain and potentially incalculably high risk with almost no greater benefit than less precarious alternatives.  But Black market sales weren't the concern there.  Nor are they ever really a concern, because it is logistically impractical to try to prevent it.  Future misuse or misappropriation are just inherent risks.  

In any event, Ukraine is not Syria.  Regime change is not the desired end for anyone, other than Vladimir Putin.  No appropriate analogy can be drawn to any case of Cold War appropriations to anti-Soviet opposition or insurgency.  There is an appropriate analogy to be drawn, however, to Bosnia.  There, earlier intervention might have shortened the conflict duration and resulted in fewer casualties in the long run.",e2b0e6a27356e72c2742182cb507aa058c1768fd,True,False,,,,,0,1647669684,,0,{},i192s5o,False,t3_th3svd,False,True,t1_i16c7hq,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i192s5o/,1647669699,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647640884.0,[],text,t2_oop22,False,True,

But  “Nazi ideology” in Ukraine looks different in reality.  That is, they explicitly reject the label of Nazi because it is seen as foreign and “not Ukrainian enough”.  Simultaneously they believe in the core ideology of a pure Ukrainian nation (both ethically and culturally).

A 2014 report from BBC:

The group that you’d find actual Ukrainians (and Russian state media) talking about, but hardly ever foreigners, are not the Azov Battalion, but “The Right Sector”, who were heavily involved in Maiden and Ukrainian politics, with many reports of them operating with impunity post-Maiden

If you are interested, this is a 2016 documentary from a French journalist.  Keep in mind this is a strongly DNR/LNR perspective.  That is, there has essentially been a civil war on and off in Ukraine since Maiden (2014) and this is the perspective highly sympathetic to “other side”;  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b8j0tJsKltg

I personally find the reporting from 2014-2020 more informative than now for getting historical context.

Right now its wartime and for obvious reasons (logistics due to the country being in actual war, journalists not wanting to risk their necks, media driven up to support or not support the war effort, etc) its not easy to get somewhat objective information.  Past reporting was made when most people had no dog in the fight so the vibe is just more normal.

It's an easily observable phenomenon that when a country is being invaded, nationalism spikes and hard-line conservatives with some... Controversial views on outsiders find a very receptive audience.

You can literally go to r/Ukraine right now and see people calling Russians orcs and pigs, saying any good Russian is a dead Russian, and spouting some pretty hyper nationalist ideology. And western media seems to be having a hard time finding pictures of people in uniform that aren't sporting a black sun patch. 

Plus the Ukrainian government is not some huge, modern military with a standing army ready to fend off Russia. They are having to deputize local militias, some of which have these extreme political views.

These views, just like the weapons, will not magically disappear even if Ukraine does ""win"" this conflict. The government, if it survives, will have to contend with and try to tame these extreme chauvinist sentiments and ask them to give up their weapons.

History shows that is a very difficult task. It's much more likely the extremists win democratic elections immediately following any peace because public support for their views will never be higher, and they can use their weapons to intimidate more peaceful factions.",d6927014147afcf991f167b0862eb21c27372683,True,False,,,,,0,1647648437,,0,{},i1801i5,False,t3_th3svd,False,True,t3_th3svd,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3svd/the_false_promise_of_arming_insurgents_americas/i1801i5/,1647648451,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647619637.0,[],text,t2_7grhe,False,False,
