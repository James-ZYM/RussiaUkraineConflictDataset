Since the benefit of hypersonic weapons is that they can alter their profiles to try to survive against air defenses, as opposed to bigger faster weaponry(like traditional ballistic missiles who's flight profile has them coming in steep)

(Also, see this from the Missile Defense agency regarding these- https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41164/missile-defense-agency-lays-out-how-it-plans-to-defend-against-hypersonic-threats

* Take Kyiv and install a puppet regime
* Perhaps take the rest of the so-called Donbas People's Republics claimed borders
* Change Ukraine's constitution, likely to be in line with their pre-Crimean referendum offer on [March 17 '14](https://www.rus.rusemb.org.uk/foreignpolicy/1921), which would essentially turn Ukraine into a completely de-centralised state, giving each region veto rights over foreign, cultural, and economic policy.
* Likely conduct extensive purges in major cities that they occupy, replacing old pro-Western/pro-reform/civil rights/etc., activists, journalists, supporters of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, government officials, etc., with Russia-friendly satraps. 
* De-militarisation, with very favourable limits on Ukraine's army, basing arrangements, weapons systems allowed, etc., to suit future Russian contingency plans (that's not what they're saying, but it's implied)

So far, Russia has achieved: capture Melitopol, Kherson, and Berdyansk. These cities were underprepared and far away from central supply lines. There are constant protests/riots in these cities. People are aware of the farce. In addition, Russia's diplomatic track has softened, with regime change off the table (Zelensky stays). They've also started proposing more reasonable numbers for de-militarisation. They will get constitutional changes in the form of Ukraine being a neutral state and seem open to allowing Ukraine to sign a separate mutual defence clause with Turkey, UK, and the USA. So, out of their major goals, they're getting neutrality but Ukraine is getting something for it too. That's a big step down from regime change, which would give them carte blanche to turn Ukraine into Belarus v2.0. So, we can already see that the war is, in some ways, in Ukraine's favour due to the major step down from maximalist goals. We always have to remember that wars are about getting things that we want (i.e., they're just an extension of negotiations). And if your military can't deliver, you start asking for less. We're seeing that happen.

If you've read the [news recently](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/03/18/they-don-t-know-ukraine), the Ukrainian side is saying that Crimea and Donbas are not part of this peace plan. Their position is that this war right now is about Russia withdrawing to their Feb 23rd positions. Then negotiations can begin. I don't think that's what will happen, but it's their position for now.

[],False,,thesaddestpanda,,,[],,,,text,t2_58ojx,False,True,"Great analysis. No one seems to remember 4 weeks ago when the West wanted to surrender Ukraine, build a government in exile with Zelensky, and let Russia have it to avoid trouble. Most of Putin's calculations and assumptions were correct and I think the FSB analysts probably weren't aware of the huge shambles that is their military. I imagine that was hidden from everyone and potentially funds diverted to middle-men, bribes, oligarchs, generals, etc that should have went to products and maintenance.  Parking your best weapons, men, ammo, etc and using them all up in Syria to show prospective buyers how nice your weapons are didn't help either.

Partly because of US/NATO advising since 2014 but mostly because of the incredible Ukrainian fighting force that all of Putin's plans collapsed. No one expected this, not Russia or the ""informed"" CIA everyone thinks is so much better than the FSB. Both got it wrong. Heck, Putin's miscalculation is far smaller than the US's in Afghanistan, so there's a real glass house/stones aspect here when people laugh at the FSB/Putin assumptions.  

On paper Ukraine should have folded. In reality, javs

I'm also not above thinking asking Zelensky to leave was a PR thing to make him seem stronger at the expense of making the West look wimpy. Its sophisticated psy-ops and I like it but I dont think the CIA/Biden would have allowed being humiliated like that again so soon after Afghanistan. I think it was a real offer and they really thought he'd take it. I think the American and Russian oligarchs got together and told everyone to make this happen and then Putin would agree to be ""kinder"" to Ukraine, perhaps putting in a puppet that wouldn't setup purges, pograms, and camps, but just rule with an iron fist, a la Belarus. I imagine any backdoor deal is gone and if Putin takes control its going to be a bloodbath for civilians once his men take power.

I also think these secret State Dept/CIA/DoD of whoever red-telephone stle calls happend with the SU-25's.  Putins men told us not to do it, so we didn't. What they were planning to do in retaliation is something I wonder about. I imagine there's a lot of leverage Russia has on the USA and EU that's not going to make it into the press and won't be talked about because the West needs to push the ""he's an irrational dying madman"" dialogue for domestic propaganda purposes. You can see it in this forum. Everyone thinks he's totally nuts and the Russians are just doing random things in Ukraine instead of steadily gaining ground in the east and more or less immune from any counter-offensive scenario. Not to mention the sanctions are extremely weak and nowhere near the total swift ban and export ban needed to actually hurt Russia. I imagine the EU/US oligarchs don't want to hurt the bottom line too much, so we get these soft sanctions that didn't help in 2014 and aren't really helping today outside of propaganda/boycott avoidance purposes (Mcdonalds leaving, etc).",fe9b3319c8b2666f514b0609a7bf2d549e163e2d,True,False,,,,,0,1647733859,,0,{},i1cddbd,False,t3_thgku2,False,True,t1_i19ik06,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/thgku2/enraged_putin_csiss_dr_eliot_cohen_and_dr_seth/i1cddbd/,1647733870,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647705059.0,

No need to put ""victory"" in quotes. If you gain more than you lose, that's victory. Putin doesn't care about dead Russians in 2022 any more than he cared about them at Grozny or the subsequent conflicts. His doctrine involves feeding his own people to the meatgrinder.

What he does care about is territorial gains and mineral and wealth gains. Chancellor Olaf of Germany appears to be unwilling to stop buying raw material and O&amp;G from him, and every time he conquers a territory, some of the people he conquers are willing to fight for him in the next conflict. (see: Chechnya, Georgia, Donbas and Crimea). It's his puppet governments that don't have a strong hold that struggle to supply troops (Belarus, etc).

Even if he walks away with only what he has already taken, he's come out ahead, and time has shown that he can restart the offensive whenever he wants more (1999, 2008, 2009, 2014, 2022).

&gt;**The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically.** Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

Seems like predictions that Mauripol's eventual fall leading to the collapse of the souther front are going out the window. Probably Russia's last true hope to turn this into a war of maneuver.",1b0a96d0c68de09f2440dc6cab377c0fbfc8cdb0,True,False,,,,,0,1647729015,,0,{},i1c2yp8,False,t3_thygmg,False,True,t3_thygmg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/thygmg/ukraine_megathread_march_19/i1c2yp8/,1647729031,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647700215.0,
[],False,,Dramatic_Quiet_5796,,,[],,,,text,t2_k3mdzzkd,False,False,"No, there's a near-zero chance of a major counter offensive to retake anything. The entire Ukrainian strategy vs Russia is about holding out near cities. Too far out of cities and it's just flat open steppe terrain, it's a death trap essentially. By staying in the cities they force Russians to cross the steppe and be vulnerable to all manner of attacks in their advance. Being near/in the cities gives them good supply and also provides them with advantageous defensive opportunities. This is all the more prominent because Russian armor needs Ukrainian roads to reach their objectives, giving Ukrainians a distinct advantage in planning when/how to attack. We've seen this most prominently in the Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts where there are constant attacks on supply lines and reinforcing armor. 

Counterattacking, however, places the Ukrainian army in the same vulnerable position that the Russian army is exposed to on their attack. Russia has more troops to sacrifice than Ukraine, so it can send more into the meatgrinder. But this is untenable for Ukraine which needs to conserve manpower and use it more efficiently. There's also a stark materiel advantage for Russia too. So all the signs point out to Ukraine simply fighting out to survive and inflict enough punishment to deter Russian further offensives. In essence, a combination of political will, military strength, and economic resistance will factor into the Kremlin's decision on when they'll decide to sue for peace. 

Source: I spoke to Ukrainian military higher ups while there in 2017 and 2018 for research purposes, who had already envisioned this scenario and had plans for it. Except in all of their scenarios, Russia attacked with closer to 300,000 troops... So perhaps that's also another clue..?

Almost all ballistic missiles are technically hypersonic. The new technology (which this missile wasn't) are hypersonic glide vehicles which can maneuver very significantly at hypersonic speeds, additionally hypersonic vehicles can be fitted with ram jet engines to cruise at these speeds but my understanding is that there aren't serious weapons platforms capable of cruising at hypersonic speeds just yet. The speeds are nothing new, but the ability to maneuver (outside of just gently correcting your trajectory) are new.

Those should have significant effects on ABM penetration, particularly when compared with slower short and intermediate range ballistic missiles which tend to fly slow enough for ballistic missile defense systems to be at least useful if not effective. We can expect these vehicles to increase the difficulty of intercepting ICBMs as well, but the actual effectiveness of existing ABM systems in intercepting ICBMs in realistic scenarios is pretty questionable, so it might be a lot more effective to just employ more conventional reentry vehicles for the same price. I don't blame countries for feeling that their nuclear deterrent could be cut down or even invalidated if major progress in ABM systems is made in the near future.

If I was a major nuclear power, I wouldn't want to be caught flat-footed if hypersonics become a major part of the picture over the next decade or two, but I think they're a bit overblown in terms of being a game changer when it comes to how they change the status quo.",02d8f884a4bc7fc26dfea5e08d4b2fa2b937ad3b,True,False,,,,,0,1647727584,,0,{},i1bzrbk,False,t3_thygmg,False,False,t1_i1bued8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/thygmg/ukraine_megathread_march_19/i1bzrbk/,1647727596,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647698784.0,

YesNo. Hypersonic is a speed. Its is a speed weapons have been reaching for many decades. But some kinds of vehicles that fit into this such as air breathing low altitude and very high altitude glide vehicles are attempts to get by current generation anti missile systems. 

This will be an ongoing battle for many years. As technology improves missile defense will improve and the technologies to get round it improves. It will always be in a state of flux

&gt;imagine a cruise missile going Mach 5 instead of, say, Mach 2 has a much lower chance of interception, but is it really just a different point on a scale of probability as opposed to the much more binary ""we have no effect defense against hypersonic missiles?"" 

The lower in the atmosphere the ability to go faster hits problems that such as drag that scale square and heat that scale cubically. In other words doubling velocity squares the drag and increases heat by a cubic function. 

Low level hypersonic is a bit of a hmmmmmmm to outright myth. 

&gt;an iskander on a plane, 

Russia is a poor country trying to appear bigger than it is. They have a weapon that can get by Ukraines Soviet era defences. They may be able to get by western defences but that has always been true of missiles. Hitting things moving fast has always been hard. 

But this attack really is little more than what the US would have sent in some F-35s with some guided bombs to achieve. Having to make the first combat use of a weapon deep in enemy territory where parts are recovered indicates desperation. 

&gt;you're saying the conventional weapon imbalance is in favor of NATO,

To the point its screwed up the ""escalation ladder"". Where the Russians would go nuclear we just ramp up the conventional weapons. 

Ironically this leaves us in a huge hole. Our response to Russia bombing seven shade of sh\*t out of Mauripol could be to go big conventionally. But Russia has not response without going tactical nuclear. 

This is part of why so many in the defence community are having to say ""hold back, this could get ugly"". We have simply over powered our selves for something like this plus cold war logic. 

&gt;t if Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, then western opinion would favor direct intervention.

My personal take is we can feed in very effective conventional weapons into Ukraine that can cause huge pain for them. We also have some huge huge financial leverage that could push them back to real least developed status. 

We have to be the morally responsible people. We cannot unchain our full conventional force. 

But in return we owe Ukrainian people f\*cking huge. Real f\*cking huge. 

They are our proxy because we could easily push Russia to go nuclear. 

It is no longer fashionable to think like this.

&gt;The problem, accordig to intelligence anyway is the Russians only ever had the troops for a quick blitz- move in, take Kyiv and set up a puppet government. That didn't happen

There are two ways for that to have not happened -- Russia tried seriously to do that and failed, or Russia never thought it was high probability and hedged their bets. ***The difference between these two scenarios is crucial***, and seems underexamined -- that's my whole point.

&gt;But yes, we are only guessing. That's all we can do.

We could also, like -- not guess about stuff we have no real way of knowing, and base our assessments on observable facts -- if you remove ""according to intelligence"", ""some believe"", ""I think"", etc from your assessment -- what is left?",93d251fe4934afe0a908d40d48a7a28e2c7167bb,True,False,,,,,0,1647725275,,0,{},i1buhf2,False,t3_thygmg,False,True,t1_i1br7q1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/thygmg/ukraine_megathread_march_19/i1buhf2/,1647725292,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647696475.0,

So do hypersonics really not represent a substantial increase in ABM penetrative ability?

China can bring a much larger and well-equipped force to bear than Russia can due to the strength of its economy. War with Taiwan would be largely naval conflict with heavy use of PGMs, unlike what is going on in Ukraine. 

The stakes are way higher than in Ukraine. The average household in the US probably doesn't use a single thing from Ukraine. Every household in the US uses semiconductors from Taiwan. China taking over Taiwan would be an existential crisis for the West, Ukraine not as much. 

The PRC's thinking (which is probably accurate) is that war with Taiwan means war with the US. The US isn't going to war over Ukraine. That is a big part of why there hasn't been an attack on Taiwan, that and it would be an economic catastrophe for the Chinese economy.

We'll never know how much of a threat they are in a real peer to peer conflict until one happens. These governments have the difficult task of infiltrating companies and organizations, and holding onto that foothold until an opportune moment (peer to peer conflict). Maintaining access is more difficult these days as the security space has moved towards the assumption that any network is already hacked, which is why threat hunting and incident response have evolved. So these governments maintain access, and likely hold onto and develop zero days so that they have them if needed. However, the longer you sit on access or private exploits, the more likely the public security space also discover the same vulnerabilities. So it is difficult to judge how much a particular country has prepared to go with at a current moment. 

While it never seems that way, the US is very much a cyber peer to China/Russia. We don't have a reputation, mostly since China/Russia don't have a free press that constantly reports and blows up every attack. Companies in China/Russia aren't required, as they are in the US in most industries, to publish that they are involved in security incidents. However, the US has the advantage of an extremely literate and compute savy population to pull talent from. The government, military, and private organizations spend A LOT of money to develop talent, and it works. We likely aren't seeing as many effective cyber attacks in Ukraine (or by proxy in the US) because Russia just didn't end up being capable of it at the end of the day.

&gt;Russia’s deployment of hypersonic missiles was a warning to Ukraine and the west that it “has the means to escalate” the conflict further, defence expert Dr James Bosbotinis said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;New: Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat, multiple US officials tell CNN. The US was able to track the launches in real time, the sources said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;More: Traveling at Mach 5 or faster, hypersonic weapons are difficult to detect, posing a challenge to missile defense systems. Hypersonic missiles can travel at a far lower trajectory than high-arcing ballistic missiles, which can be easily detectable.

True, although for the US, there will be a point where they will have a choice. With the Air Force rumored to have had done a study that concluded cutting the final total of their purchase by 40%, and with the DoD repeatedly asking to slow down F-35 purchases, the entire program of record for the Air Force - whether it is the original # or the reduced # - won't be reached until the late 2030s to mid 2040s. 

The big thing here is that both the USAF and USN are currently simultaneously developing separate programs for a next generation family of systems, and the USAF has raised some eyebrows stating that this could result in not one but potentially two manned fighters, one better fit for the Pacific and one better fit for Europe. The USN's program will have to replace 600 something F-18s as well.

Both are targeting a 2030s introduction.

So I think we're seeing a mix of desires in the short, mid, and long term. Short term: get more mature airframes ready. Mid term: get F-35 Block IV working. Long term: depends on how good these NGAD programs are, but if these next generation platforms do hit in the 2030s, and depending on how much they end up costing, that would reduce a lot of the need to abide by the sunk cost fallacy.",9a178ebbe2c8a1e7b25e7e937d2c0690fa3ba0b7,True,False,,,,,0,1647704840,,0,{},i1aims9,False,t3_tfuobs,False,True,t1_i13fpgu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfuobs/full_weapons_tester_report_highlights_f35/i1aims9/,1647704853,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647676040.0,

[],False,,NGAD_Driver,,,[],,,,text,t2_cuw2uer4,False,False,"&gt; The second half talking about software is triggering to say the least. The approach they are taking to software development for the aircraft absolutely is the future. It is how all modern software is developed at every major tech company. Gone are the days where you can spend two years making a single air-tight binary and then deliver it, and wipe your hands clean. Modern software just does not work like that anymore because things have become so complex, and additionally when you need to go back and update software like that, it is insanely expensive. It does sound like they need to have better testing in place to make sure they aren't regressing, but saying regression bugs are being introduced as more capabilities are added is like saying water is wet. Of course they are, that's how software development goes. Especially for massively complex systems like the F-35 has.

The bigger issue - as someone who does test and has seen these issues first hand - is that unlike modern software in major tech companies, a lot of these builds are arriving that are sometimes breaking safety of flight features or critical capability features. It is a MASSIVE problem if any of these things get through undetected to operational forces.

There doesn't seem to be the same QC and contractor-end testing that you see in the private sector before builds get delivered to DT

It's particularly problematic because of the highly integrated nature of the software in the F-35. All the lack of physical switches in the jet is because a lot of functions are run through the MC via the PCD - so imagine fixing Fusion and breaking Auto GCAS.

What the private sector does a lot better at - and what older fighters unintentionally did - is containerize different pieces of code.

Analysts have said no fly zone would immediately galvanise putins support and also tip the scales in terms of support from other countries. At the moment putin screwed your launching an unprovoked war then getting heavy losses. Enacting the no fly zone changes the narrative and helps Putin, China can’t support a ud no fly zone it goes against everything they’ve ever said in propaganda.

No fly zone is a dirty word outside non us aligned sphere, it’s associated with the no fly zone in Libya which preceded NATO bombing gaddafis convoys and military targets, then bombing gaddafis vehicles he was travelling in then using special forces to guide the rebels on the ground and ensure that he could be executed. And very inadvisable things like bombing the man made river and Libya then turning into a hell hole.


If we’d declare a no fly zone all it would do is shift the narrative, then Putin would step up nuclear threats and likely have less domestic pressure in terms of protecting the war and get more international dupport. After he makes more nuclear threats, people back home would say what is the point in this? This could end the world? Biden would likely back down and it would then give Putin a face saving victory and he’d be able to spin it as attempted aggression of the west.

Even if we didn’t back down declaring the no fly zone then needs to be enforced, that means shooting down their jets, and we’d also get losses.

It just has near zero reward for so much risk.

Just imagine Putin showing images of killed Russian soldiers on the ground claiming “ the unites states is killing our boys, when we were just peacekeeping and stopping nazis” he could just crawl the war and protract long enough over 3 months to get volunteers and send more people in.

This isn’t even considering the prospect of actual  escalation to ww3/ nuclear conflict.

All Russian policy and academic papers are nearly unanimous on the Ukrainian issue over the last decade. They all lead in this direction. The Ukraine intervention is a **Russian elite's deliberate and extensively discussed realpolitik-based decision**.

Our main delusions are:

1) *The intensity of sanctions is a surprise for Russia*. They are not. They expect even harsher sanctions and have been preparing for them since 2014. Their logic is that additional sanctions were being imposed every year anyway and that it was better to endure them at once and remove that weapon from the Western arsenal.

2) *The total invasion of Ukraine is irrational*. We keep saying that a limited invasion would have made more sense. It wouldn't. The main Russian goal is to remove Ukraine as a growing military threat and a NATO springboard. Seizing an additional 10% of its territory, while paying the full price of the intervention, would not serve this purpose. In Russia's opinion, Ukraine must be forced to give up its military ambitions, domestic and international. A total invasion is the only way to achieve this objective.

3) *Russia enjoys no international support*. It does. Plenty of countries simply do not care, or they outright support Russia. In fact, the only countries that have taken action against Russia's invasion belong to the West and represent about 10% of the world population.

4) *It is possible to convince China to turn against Russia*. It is not. The two countries have been systematically cooperating on decoupling the Russian economy from the West for a decade. The invasion of Ukraine is clearly agreed upon in advance between Moscow and Beijing. The chances that the West can convince China to forget that we called them an enemy until yesterday and turn against its only geopolitical ally are exactly zero.

So far the only surprise for Russia is the intensity of Ukraine's resistance. But they can clearly deal with this by increasing pressure and changing their tactics. And even this surprise plays into the hands of the Kremlin hawks - ""See? This was the last moment to break them before the West weapons and training made them too strong. We were almost too late.

Why their boats, houses and banking accounts were A-OK one day and after the invasion they get frozen, even though no evidence is shown that they helped or even supported the invasion? Hell - they were the ones who got to lose the most due to sanctions. Some are even outspoken critics of it.”

The fortunes of the oligarchs have always been viewed as being suspect, however not much could be done because under the laws of Putin’s Russia and with Putin’s courts, some oligarchs could defend themselves as having done nothing wrong. Others who are estranged from Putin would at best be tossed by Putin straight to jail without a fair trial and possibly just disappeared/tortured/etc.

Russian people have a history of evicting their government anytime an easy to win war goes badly so now that Putin’s regime and courts may be replaced the west believes it may be a good idea to freeze oligarch’s assets for safe keeping so that the Russian government that replaces Putin can take a second look into the legitimacy of their wealth. This is similar to freezing assets of fleeing government officials and dictators and detaining them even if they broke no law in their country at the time they did what they did to acquire their fortunes.

Once Russia has a new government, new courts, etc the oligarchs and their assets can be returned for judgment by their fellow citizens. There is no intent to steal the wealth. The intent is to give oligarchs former fellow citizens a chance to decide “justice”.  The asset freezes are for political reasons - western banks etc are forced by their national law to do it. How does that make anyone in the west more wealthy? For all the western businesses involved this is a loss. Ditto loss of business from any future wealth that seeks to hide. 

All of this may seem terribly unfair however if you believe western laws and courts are unfair you should stay away from western jurisdictions. Perhaps do your banking in your own country (Russia, etc) or with North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Cuba or whatever regime you believe has laws that are “fair”. “Vote with your feet” as they say.

I am going to talk past this poster and explain why the US had so little focus on hypersonics for intermediate range weapons. 

Firstly all ground launched intermediate ranged weapons were banned by the USSR and US on treaty grounds. Those treaties were revoked because China began developing weapons in that category. 

Second the US is a very air power oriented force. It relies of AWAC such as E-2 and E-3 to be able to spot low flying missiles hundreds of kilometers away. So coming in low is not really evasion. 

To come in fast you have to go high. Atmospheric drag has a huge huge huge impact on performance below a few thousand meters up. Drag squares and static temperature cubes so in the lower troposhere anything above mach 2 starts being really really hot and lacking in range. The theory is that since you cannot go low to avoid US systems, go high and fast. So China and Russia began investing in IRBMs with a relative high speed. 

This means you can see them early. But they are not crazy new technology. Its just a variation on decades old solid rocket powered missiles. Not as high and fast as ICBMs but further and faster than SRBMs. Stick the word ""hypersonic"" in it and everyone is rolling their eyes out the back of their heads with hype. 

The US still relies on its huge arsenal of air launched cruise missiles but is transitioning to more high velocity ballistic or semi ballistic trajectory IRBMs. 

Its an evolutionary step. Its likely that system like SM-3 and THAAD will have a reasonable interception rate. But we can only really speculate. 

The more exotic hypersonic glide vehicles and the like have been ignored for this post. 

Not trying to make a point or show one country better than another. Just explain why this technology is arriving now. 

A) Treaties have been ditched. 

B) Seen as the best way past AWAC and other layers of air defence.",df70716e039943bbc79e910c549a952973fc7fd6,True,False,,,,,0,1647683614,,0,{},i19iomz,False,t3_th1yuy,False,True,t1_i19hz8y,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/th1yuy/ukraine_megathread_march_18/i19iomz/,1647683627,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647654814.0,

Given how successful the ""annex and watch the world squirm but do nothing"" playbook has been for Putin in the past, he might not have needed much of a nudge to try it again.

Summary of the article:

&gt; PLA special operations forces (SOF) would likely play important supporting roles in an amphibious assault on Taiwan. Their capabilities and training are geared towards several missions undertaken during the preparatory and main assault phases of the landing, including infiltration via special mission craft and helicopter, reconnaissance and targeting, obstacle clearance, strikes and raids, and extraction missions. While PLA SOF have made progress in recent years, several longstanding challenges could affect their performance in an island landing: integrating advanced special mission equipment for complex and dangerous missions, coordinating their operations with non-SOF supporting and supported forces, and overcoming the Chinese military’s penchant for centralized command. Even if PLA SOF are only partially effective, however, their support to the main assault force could diminish Taiwan’s ability to defend itself from a large-scale invasion.

One in particular are the two barracks bombings that have happened. It seems unconscionable to me to not have a system in place to get Soldiers out of barracks, either through monitoring the airspace and evacuating when a strike is being vectored in, or having Soldiers so long as they can, be sleeping outside in dispersed camouflaged bivouac. I also believe, that one of the barracks was within range of artillery. Just a very unnecessarily large loss of life by not having men in bunkers or cover. Soldiers shouldn't be dying in their beds. Ukrainians are still losing more proportions of their trained forces by percentage for each casualty they take. We have to assume that Russia is going to continue to attack and switch out its units, and pursue foreign fighters that it is more than capable of equipping. Russia can simply afford more losses than the Ukrainians. It will just get longer and bloodier. I can see the chance of localized counter attacks retaking some critical terrain but I doubt the ability of Ukraine to push back Russia to its borders. I have doubts that NATO will provide the weapons needed to push back Russia in that Russia will still be able to wield artillery superiority.

So by dint of being modern with modern materials and the Russians relying on equipment meant to fight decades ago it looks great against their systems. 

If you will indulge my wild ar\*ed guesses Id also say the operators may be poorly trained. They may be seeing them on their screens but not trained to pick them out vs the clutter. 

On a US system this would likely need a software rewrite. Though I suspect but do not know that operators may have modes of operation with mostly  raw radar returns as in the old days, rather than the kind we see in movies and videogames where the returns are assed by computer and identified for the operator. And the operators will be easy to train to pick out drones. 

Also the drones should be quite noise in EM emissions. Youd imagine they are easy to spot that way. 

I also think that while they are useful, the vast majority of killed vehicles we see is from artillery and close fired rockets like Javelin and especially Stugna, likely the most common killer of Russian armored vehicles. 

Its worth noting OSINT sources noted a rapid drop in TB-2 footage after the first few days and it has returned but not all that frequently.

It is a deeply unserious position, because it presents both short and long-term risks of nuclear war for a result that can be achieved by simply giving Ukraine proper equipment; i.e, MiGs and more AA (that they're familiar with).

Obviously, that hasn't quite been hashed out, as seen with the MiG debacle. But all the energy spent on the No-Fly-Zone proposal isn't energy being spent on something that is feasible and will obtain the same strategic result.

Not having reasons that you judge to be ""good enough"" is not the same as being irrational. I agree that this was a mistake for Putin, and even before the invasion I was posting here and in LCD that I felt an invasion was a no-win scenario for Putin.

That doesn't mean that Putin isn't a rational actor though. It just means he was wrong about his motivations, as well as his assumptions. Putin clearly believes in some form of Russian neo-imperialism involving a Russian sphere of influence over most of Eastern Europe. We can disagree over the true value that such a sphere of influence would provide Russia, but the notion is not so absurd that it stands apart from all reason.

A good analogy for all this is Taiwan. In so many respects, the idea of China attempting to take Taiwan by force is an astoundingly bad idea. There is some value to the island in terms of provide access to critical sea lanes, but those lanes are really only in jeopardy thanks to tensions with Taiwan. The whole conflict feels almost absurd when you can take a step back and set aside the political history of the PRC and RoC. Still, no one would say that China isn't lead by rational actors.

That issue is that China and Russia as a people do not recognize the same values we place on things like human rights and democracy. Most of the world outside the western world order doesnt either.

Both Russia and China's (and the rest of the world) people dont recognize these beliefs because they've experienced a drastically different history from us. Neither of these great powers and their people are ready to recognize a multipolar world either - America included.

Having this agreement like the western world order has is a pact to show mutual constraints t in honoring a set of rules for mutual prosperity. Agreements, like peace, requires all parties to uphold it. If one party decides to violate it, the party upholding said rules immediately becomes the victim while the violator is given a head start.

Is it morally wrong to bomb other country's to shit? Yeah you bet. But framing countries into principles of morality makes completely zero sense because never has a country acted because of morality and never will a country act on behalf of morality. Even with the human rights we recognize in the west, they are rules that we have all agreed to as being beneficial for each other. So while its morally wrong to do what the U.S has done, it doesnt necessarily make the U.S worse or on par with China or Russia or any other country. Countries with the power to do this have never held back no matter which side they are on and with enough power in there hands, they will endeavor to do the same things the U.S has done.

Finally, it's not up to us alone to determine whether or not we are in a cold war. We arent just fighting China or Russia as a country. These two countries fundamentally posses opposing beliefs against the western omworld orders beliefs. Nothing terribly wrong with that and it doesnt mean we hate them for it, but that is why conflicts will continue happening and no matter how many times you crush China and Russia, a new government will arise and take its place in opposing the west.

Having said that, we ought to see them for what they really are - adversaries that we enjoy  situational symbiosis with. We dont need to hate then but we need to not let our guard down against our adversaries. Whether you like it or not, we are already in another cold war. Maybe not as cold as the last one, but to fight it, we had better get in cold war mentality.",52078d5d07fc8c88529fed19237f32b727e4eb5d,True,False,,,,,0,1647668475,,0,{},i19163m,False,t3_th1yuy,False,True,t1_i17pmzs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/th1yuy/ukraine_megathread_march_18/i19163m/,1647668491,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647639675.0,

And thus, they are too clumsy to be used to counter-value strike the Russian logistics delivery systems and leave the majority of the landscape untouched as subkiloton yield Iskander would.

When you have a 12-15km prompt radius, I guess it doesn't matter but the important thing here is that these are declared to NATO.  

That means they cannot be released without NATO consent.  And I doubt if Norway and Turkey, both of whom keep losing V-22s in awkward places for some reason, would appreciate the EU pretending she has suddenly grown some teeth.  EU doesn't have any canines at all.  Best case, she has a set of full plate dentures given her on loan by the parent NATO organization, which actually secures her existence.  And these are ultimately, tactically, guaranteed by U.S. capabilities.

NATO itself is crippled.  It only has B61-11/12 nuclear free fall ordnance which is probably not penetrable against a high density GBAD threat, even with stealth.  And would be incredibly slow and unresponsive, to road mobile missiles, even if can be brought close.

The Organization has absolutely nothing _declared_ which can compete with Kh-102 or Iskander-M.  The U.S. does but it's a classified, strategic only, capability.

This is what happens when you design unilateral disarmament agreements around European distaste of the best defense they ever had and not a 'Let fear reside in your enemy's heart of immediate and overwhelming retaliation in kind' mirror-the-terror counterforce.

Without EU tanks on the ground as an armored escort capability.  Without at least road mobile, 'quick halt', erect and shoot, MEADS.  Without long radius airpower able to provide 2-3hr hangtime on at least a 1,000km radius (requiring multiple tanker buys and CFT clearance which EU doesn't have funding for; neither Rafale nor Typhoon being even remotely qualified, as-is, for a Ukrainian fight).  Without a _comprehensive_ DEAD and EW plan, backed by suitable jamming assets and long-range ELS/ARM.

EU is not a player, in the one force component it could quickly scramble to the Ukraine, even if it unwisely bases-in to her territory, directly.

Putin, thanks to a bunch of American supported USOF with high level ATGW, covert ISR assets and advanced UCW training, cannot win without a massive Ops Pause.

But Ukraine is itself increasingly subject to isolation and cutoff from all the amenities which make ordinary civilian life in high density urban zones possible.  The Russians control the roads.  They control the ether and if they still have overhead and/or drone recce, via Reis-D or similar; they can target any fixed utilities asset they choose.

So please, stop pretending that this is about the EU suddenly standing up on it's hind legs as a nation state.  Or that one million people will matter in a country of 44 million.  More than half of whom are now likely behind enemy lines.

Without any accurate, updated, ORBAT on what Ukraine has left after a month of high intensity missile interdiction; we have to assume they have nothing.  Largely because, as a low tier, third rank, power; decimated by the 2014 battle, they had nothing to going in to begin with.

And without indigenous combat power to tackle the threats now cutting off the Capital and Southern Cities, the ability of USOF to influence the approaches fight will greatly diminish, even as the Russian security mission for their LOCs will get easier because they hold both ends and are not driving an advance.

The only thing that matters now is whether Putin is such a politician that he is willing to slink away, wounded, knowing he has likely signed his death warrant, to achieve early relief on Sanctions.

Or if he is all-in and 'negotiations' are just a way to open a window of regeneration time while his forces reconfigure and begin to close The Bear's jaws around the windpipe of the Ukrainian people.

To many of those civilians don't know what they are facing, thanks to the endless, slanted, propaganda spew.  Though they are starting to get a taste of it.  And thus we cannot allow them to nominate us to be their saviors, in their weakened desperation, as ignorant dreams of guerilla warriorhood die hard and they start to cry for help.

We are operating in Putin's backyard.  And if he says nukes are on the table, we had better believe him.  While, without armored column escorts to ram relief convoys inwards, _against his wishes_ to weaken their wills; the Ukrainians cries will become shrieks of desperation.  To which we must deafen our ears.

And if Zelensky has any compassion at all, when he realizes The West is not coming, he will yield, rather than break, his people.

This doesn't mean we give up on Ukraine.  It means we create a foothold, a lodgment state, so that we cannot be locked out.  And then we wait for Putin _to come to us_ across that great wide nothing of Western Ukraine, where we can see him from hundreds of klicks out using ZPY-2 radar on a Blk.40 GHawk or RQ-180, orbiting at 70,000ft well back from the Polish border.  If he's dumb and keeps coming, we annihilate him, with conventional weapons, just like the Baghdad Division was wiped out, in 2003.

If he's smart, he stops inside his hyperSAM coverage and we have a nuclear standoff, just like before.  While the sanctions work.
  
The important thing is West Ukraine is quickly made NATO.  We are never leaving.  Russia is poor but not broken, as we lose the Crimean and Donbass offshore gas/oil deposits and EU-rope takes a good 10 years before they are back on nuclear power as electric heating with it's ENORMOUS energy density advantages of 83 million Megajoule vs. 55 Megajoule, per kilo, leverage over LNG.

Russia has that long to get their house in order before _we_ turn off the valves on their energy exports.  And all the while, CAG/CAD do what they do, playing 'heroes in the east' with Ukrainians who are actually USOF, just like they have always been, throughout this 'war'.  Continually stinging the occupation forces.

How violent does that get?

One parent post above said: ""China ... I don't think they'll feel safe buying US treasuries going forward.""

Another said: ""They've already been divesting themselves of their US treasuries for years. But yeah, I highly doubt they're planning to purchase more in the foreseeable future.""

When USA buys more stuff from China than China buys from USA, China runs trade surplus and has to hold USD credits that they have not spent so they park that as US treasuries that they can use to buy other stuff from USA or from others.

China sends USA stuff they make. USA sends CHINA stuff we make and credits (USD / treasuries) to make up for any short fall. For them to keep selling us more than we sell them they have to accept and hold our credits (aka USD/treasuries). Value of trade is always balanced. The side that sends more stuff has to accept and keep credits to buy stuff from us later. To cash those credits _someone_ (China or whoever they unload them to) will eventually have to buy stuff from USA mean time inflation eats the value of those credits (they buy less and less stuff).

The question you quoted as if to answer was: ""How can China continue to run a trade trade surplus with USA if not by accumulating US treasuries?""

Putin then had a slow slide into his own brand of history, where ""solving the Ukrainian question"" and righting perceived historical injustices is central. He wanted a repeat of Crimea for these reasons, but obviously failed.

Yes, but that fundamental assumption was based on what to me seem like incredibly irrational propositions, based in little other than chauvinism. That Ukraine won't defend itself because deep down Ukranians long to be in a union with Russia, that Ukranian leadership is somehow foreign to it, and that the people would gladly see their democracy fall. Do you remember Putin's bizarre call to Ukrainian soldiers to depose their leaders, for example? It is some deeply irrational nationalism that drove this decision making process in the Kremlin. 

Because, let us be clear, Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated in the last 8 years that it is a country of people determined to preserve their hard earned democracy, both by democratically electing two very different presidents and by looking to replace them with better options (Zelensky would hardly have won reelection prior to the war had he faced a competent competitor), and by continously fighting and dying on the frontlines in Donetsk and Luhansk for their country. And not losing spirit over it. All the evidence on the ground seemed to indicate that the last 8 years had made Ukraine a much more solid and united country than it had been before. Not to mention that everything indicated that the Ukrainian military was a completely reformed and massive organization with little in common with its 2014 incarnation. 

Yet Russia's leadership assumed the invasion's critical objectives would be completed in three days, with the war lasting only two weeks? To me it seems like that severe miscalculation could only have happened due to a great amount of irrationality being at play in the heart of Kremlin. 

And that's not even mentioning how they expected the EU to more or less tolerate their massive invasion of a sovereign country on European soil? Sure the EU had been moderate in sanctioning Russian interventionism in Crimea and the east of Ukraine before, but both operations were quick (and in the case of Crimea, bloodless) affairs involving comparatively small troop numbers deployed under a shroud of plausible deniability - and most importantly involved areas of Ukraine with significant Russian populations, housing some of Russia's most critical military installations (Crimea). Russia, being a nuclear great power, was given a lot of reasonable consideration for those actions, and while it was punished (EU sanctions did trigger quite a harsh recession in Russia), it was only moderately so. However, how the regime in the Kremlin could think that an operation of this overwhelming scale, done without even a hint of plausible deniability (backed moreover with a chillingly Hitler-esque narrative), executed with the explicit aim of destroying a democratic government and annexing massive swathes of its territory would not unite all of Europe in opposition is beyond me.

Turkey is in NATO, so there is the expectation that they'd have to fight against the ~~USSR and WARPACT~~ Russians, and likely developed gear assuming that they'd have to defeat Russian / Soviet AA. 

Most of their rivals in the middle east are also rocking Russian / Soviet kit to varying degrees, so it makes sense to prep for that, too.  The only ones in the region sporting something different are the Saudis and Egyptians, who are using US export gear, and the Israelis, who have their own high-end equipment.  When the Bayraktar is beating the Israeli AF &amp; AA, then we can talk about real stealth.

That's entirely possible.  NATO has gotten copies of Soviet and Chinese gear in the past, and has prepped to defeat those in detail;  Iraq War I showed what that looks like.  Wouldn't be surprised if they got a hold of a few Syrian or Iraqi systems, or just straight up bought em off of other countries like Azerbaijan. 

Drones can have a fairly small radar signature, on top of getting help from NATO as to where Russian AA and radar emissions are located / strongest (aka areas to avoid).  So they're hard to see and know where to hide, essentially.

This was the logical response to breaking up Ukraine by declaring large chunks of it to be 'Greater Rossiya' Separatist Republics before splitting it with an Armored Division, down the middle.  
  
Making a separate country from Western Ukraine under /UN/ mandate, is defacto the worst possible outcome Putin wanted to avoid: namely Ukrainian sovereign choice with full justification in the eyes of the world, to join The West as 'Well, you tore your chunk off...'.  
  
It allows NATO membership which means Putin cannot attack without raising the ire of the entire Alliance.  Even as it the UN protectorate status also allows the United States to act independently, with SIOP capable stealth platforms, capable of launching cruise attacks 'as deep as it needs to', to defend Ukrainian interests by attacking Russian railbased logistics or political targets.  
  
And it assures that, whatever Putin chooses to do to dislodge both parties, from Ukrainian soil, he has to begin by picking a fight on Ukranian soil, where tactical aircraft are rapdily flowing in.  Not on Polish Soil.  Not on U.S. soil.  Ukraine.  
  
Which means, once more, he IS the external threat, he is not defending against one.  And his justification for using nuclear force against U.S. forces is greatly reduced, in the eyes of his own people.  Because it will mean local nuclear strikes which make it impossible for him to hold onto Ukraine as we vaporize his theater logistics and he cannot replace them.  
  
Finally, you don't have to attack Russian forces with U.S. ones in conventionally dislodging Russian Army units from Ukraine.  You can continue to use U.S. contracted USOF as 'regional representatives'-

All of which means we can be as brutal or as 'flexible' in our response as we choose to be.  
  
And only Ukraine will burn for it.  
  
Congratulations if you think this kind of Proxy war will turn Ukraine into a terrorism/retaliation driven landscape which completely destroys ANY national affiliation the local Russian/Ukrainian peoples have for each other.  Because that is what it is designed to do, in breaking up national/racial groups to supplant them with 'globalist identity' which is utterly vile in it's corrupting, rootless, nature.  
  
If we were led by men with balls \_and\_ brains, this kind of response would have begun on day one, using SBCTs with their '96 hours to anywhere in the world' supposed RDF capability.  Instead we are led by a senile, degenerate, pedophile, election fraud.  
  
And I am not convinced we could muster nor 'Dragon Ride' deploy such a force, before the Russians could stop it.  As a speed bump defense to stiffen Ukrainian forces pulling back into the new defensive line.  While our own heavy artillery and HIMARS and PAC-3/THAAD was dropped into place, to populate a new state's defensive battlespace, behind them.  
  
Let me make this VERY CLEAR:  Even if we can still do it, we should not try.  
  
We do not belong in Ukraine.  
  
None of this tragedy of unforced errors would have happened if we had \_Just\_ \_Left\_ \_The Bear\_ \_Alone\_.  And not tried to encroach on Russian buffer state paranoia.  The West triumphed in 1991.  We should have walked off the stage, participation trophies in hand, as humble winners in the one game which can only be won if you never play it.  
  
NATO's task was fulfilled.  Eastern Europe was rescued from the last Axis Partner.  Forty years late but better than never.  
  
Now, we are right back at Cold War tension levels.  And a best case 'win' means endless handholding of Ukraine, a destabilized Russia with 7,000 nukes, and 'open Southern Borders' with the 'Stans acting as a petri dish for potential global nuclear terrorism, no longer under Russia's thumb.  
  
And it's all entirely the fault of people like Obama and the Clintons' and particularly Joe Biden's unrepentant venal //greed// as investments in Ukrainian energy over our own national best interests in developing home energy independence.  Everything we face today, as the rejuvenated potential threat of global nuclear annihilation, has happened as a function of dropped lines at trade conferences and NATO quarterly ministers council after-parties which can best be summarized as 'Securitization of private enterprise corrupt deals via NATO firepower as club membership.'  
  
Of course the Russians are going to hear about it.  Of course they are going to be increasingly outraged at having their good-faith actions betrayed.  
The people responsible for this should be hanged, in a public square, as traitors, for the risk we now face, which they have brought back upon us.  
  
Having lived through it once, I never wanted to see this stupidity happen again, to another generation.  It kills cultural improvement and innovation as happiness, dulling everything under the miasma of constant, overarching, FEAR.    
While robbing social potential with wasted investment in wartime weapons we can only ever 'in case of fireball, break glass' use if we absolutely screw up completely.  
Where is the responsible leadership among our political class?  
It is like dealing with a constant parade of stupid children in adult bodies.",d08ff8c408f6c636f328b43e81f0ebd0c2f6335f,True,False,,,,,0,1647650184,,0,{},i183qcy,False,t3_tgpqvu,False,True,t1_i183oeb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tgpqvu/russia_crisis_military_assessment_the_weapons/i183qcy/,1647650195,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647621384.0,

If Putin attempts to starve a million people to death in the middle of Europe in 2022, there is a probability, NATO sets a no-fly zone along a truck corridor to deliver food.  
\&gt;&gt;  
  
Basal for a body metabolism 'in idle', is 1,650 Calories Per Day.  You start fight or flighting in cold weather and it rapidly goes to 2,00-2,500 or higher.  
  
Assume one third of Kyiv's 2.88 million has left for permanent exile in the West (pray that they vet these folks better than they did the MENA btw.).  Multiply 2 million by 1,650 and you have 3.3 BILLION calories per day.  A typical frozen dinner has 800-1,200 calories.  that's 2,750,000 meals per day.  
  
For one city.  
  
Higher energy density grains and canned meats requires working electricity/gas and running water to prepare or it's worthless.  
  
And here is how that plays out:  Putin doesn't need airpower.  He can use artillery to stop the flow of trucks.  He can make a valid case that fourteen days without food is not 'starvation' if an enemy combatant will not yield the field and uses civilians to delay destruction of their hostile regime.  He can even construe things to imply that using human shileds is something a terrorist does.  And Zelensky, who says his people have stockpiled food, will have no say in the matter when Putin starts to kill power and heat and water because Putin will say that he is not sending his forces into the city overrun by terrorists with Western donated ATGW.  And we can hardly demand that he does so.  
  
So we GBU-12/38 the artillery.  And the T-72/90.  And the likely AARGM the SA-21s.  i.e. we initiate an undeclared air war against a Russian field army, dug in and ready to fight with air defenses all around it.  
  
And now we are no longer a neutral but a combatant power, having killed Russian soldiers.  
  
If they are backed by Nebo/Gamma/Voronezh the SA-21 can kill F-35 stealth.  It's a matter of how much power you put on how narrow a pencil beam sector sweep, to pull the target and, at 80-90kw, the Gravestone has a lot of juice while the longwave surveillance systems can create resonant dipole effects on gross airframe shapes (canopy. nose, tail) to direct what bearing those sector scans should look.  
  
If you use stealth, you have no AARGM with which to loft-ARM back.  Because the missile is too long and it's big wingspan will not fit in any fighter weapons bay, even if you ignore the rail-forwards launch mode.  AARGM-ER fixes these issues but is not yet fielded on either the F-22 or F-35.  
  
If you employ F-16CM to get a conventional Weasel and back it up with AGM-158 and a \_lot\_ of EA-18Gs, to counter saturate, you may get the Gravestone anyway but now Putin has to use Iskander and Kh-102 to take out the Polish airbases.  Which you will need to launch from because an F-16 is radius limited and 430nm from Bialystok to Kyiv is just on the edge of achievable.  A launch from Soesterburg or Ramstein is beyond radius, especially for a No Fly Zone, where hangtime is important.  
  
And since he doesn't have enough missiles remaining to constantly brush past the ERINT while taking out Taxiways/Runways, HAS/Dispersals, BOQ, Ops Shack, Weapons, Undergound Fuel and whatever else is there to facilitate an airwar, Putin instead pops each airbase like a pimple wiht a .5KT nuke.  This creates a 10km radius of fallout around the base and likely instantly kills the 1,500-3,000 ground crews and troops passing through.  
  
It does not harm the Polish countryside or people.  And as these nuclear warheads airburst, Putin warns the U.S. that \_just like he said with the tacnukes\_ he is giving fair warning that he is not going to tolerate any further attacks on Russian forces, territory or civilians.  
  
And ANY such attack will result in a full release upon the U.S. of 30 SS-27s, which will bus 6-10 MIRVs each, over the entire Eastern Seaboard.  
  
And now, NATO has just taken a nuke-strike which has utterly devastated it's conventional airpower, to the point where continuing the NFZ is not possible.  And any counterstrike ends the world.  Because Putin, unlike Biden, does not bluff, guff or boast. He is not a senile old fool and we have stupidly backed Russia into a corner from which there is only an all or nothing outcome.  
  
Putin says exactly what he means.  As he has been trying to make us understand for the TWO DECADES he has been warning us, on video, about pulling out of treaties, pushing ABM defenses with unverifiable AEGIS Ashore VLS loads, and advancing NATO ever further eastwards, he \_will not\_ tolerate our encroachment upon his near abroad.  PERIOD.  
  
Our choice then comes down to understanding that his conventional air defenses can take care of our F-15/16, anywhere over Ukraine.  Our F-35 within 50nm of the Gravestone or 90nm of a Nebo and our AGM-158 within 20nm of the Gravestone or 40nm of the Nebo-M.  
  
And if we try any further stupidity, we risk Unrestricted General War for a problem that is not of NATO as European Concern.  We Won, in 1991.  And now NATO has complete dominance of Europe as control of it's own cultural zones.  Our loss, today, is one of offending into the Russian SOI and trying to take away their cultural control zone as buffer state.  
  
And so, completely humiliated, we back off.  Because the U.S. cannot be ruled without WDC as the chief dungheap of the corrupt empire which America has become.  And nobody who has a decent life, wants to end the world with counter-nuclear strikes on Russian theater nukes which cannot touch Russian ICBM/SLBM strategic assets.  
  
And now it is Biden whom generals and aides begin to back away from.  A broken man and a terrible Commander In Chief.  Who resigns, a few days after 'leading' America into it's greatest military loss since Pearl Harbor.  
  
As Zelensky, totally abandoned and alone, yields Ukraine.  
  
Whether or not it stays at that level, that is how it starts.  
  
\&gt;&gt;  
While this seems unthinkable from a Putin ""power is all that matters"" point of view, it is clearly in the minds of the west.
