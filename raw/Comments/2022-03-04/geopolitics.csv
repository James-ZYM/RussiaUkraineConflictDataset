As for air superiority, it's debatable. I'm not sure how many air strikes are effectively conducted in Ukraine right now, arguably the skies are owned by Russia.

We see a few ""propaganda"" videos of things like the TB2, but we are only shown 2 strikes from those. So it's very hard to compare.

The S400s are the kings of the air-battle space. That system reigns supreme. And from what can be told from outside Ukraine, it is working....I've not found someone inside Ukraine to tell me otherwise.

Russia doesn't prefer maneuver warfare, they prefer a grotesque over abundance of artillery.

Which is why Ukraine is so perplexing. This is their doctrine. There's typically 3 types of fire in artillery.

Fire for ranging.

Fire for effect.

Fire to destroy.

For the US those are:

* 10%
* 30%
* 60%

If I recall. I don't want to get in the particulars of how many rounds that means at what intervals/times over how much distance, just a ball park that's how much of the area should be cratered by the end of the shelling.

Russia's doctrine for the same categories are:

* 10%
* 60%
* 90%

[],False,,Marzy-d,,,[],,,,text,t2_q5bzo,False,False,"&gt;Do you think rich Western Ukraine hanging out there on Russia’s flank could last long with just some UN mumbo-jumbo “security agreement”? If I were Ukraine I wouldn’t believe it. And as soon as they get a US security guarantee, they are as good as in NATO which is not acceptable to Russia.
""Rich Western Ukraine""? Ukraine is the 3rd poorest country in Europe; only Moldova and Kosovo are poorer.

Sorry if I was unclear. I was projecting the future of this “neutral” Ukraine which would be free to realize their aspirations to have closer European ties.  This would be the country whose security would have to be assured by these talks.


&gt;Nitpick aside, the US is never giving a security guarantee to Ukraine. Not because it's not acceptable to Russia, but because we're never sending 1 pair of boots on the ground to fight Russians on Ukrainian soil.

If the US will never send troops to Ukraine, they will never get into NATO. And if they never get into NATO, Putin has zero to worry about in terms of security.  So why would there ever be a need to negotiate any concessions? Ukraine already is neutral, albeit against their will.


&gt;Which is kind of the problem here, no? Russia indicated that they were willing to fight over Ukraine; we repeatedly indicated that we were not. So if you care about saving (Ukrainian) lives at all, then there's really no choice but to try to achieve some sort of negotiated outcome (with the only sticks being what we're doing now via sanctions etc.)

But, as I pointed out, there really is no mutually agreeable solution to be had by negotiation.  There have been sanctions on Russia since the annexation of Crimea, and they had no effect on Putin’s regional ambitions.  What are you planning to say at the negotiating table? Putin wants Ukraine for Russia. Ukraine wants to be independent. How do you split the baby? Russia gets half of Ukraine? In return for what?


&gt;Now if we never cared about saving Ukrainian lives and this was instead all some ploy for us and the world to discover that the vaunted Russian military is still astoundingly poor in logistics, well, mission accomplished.

That would have been a highly counterproductive strategy given most military experts are gobsmacked at how badly Russia is bungling this. The expectation was that Russia would have taken most important military objectives in 72 hours.  So all that provoking a war would do we be to expose our own weakness in relation to Russia, hardly a foreign policy goal.


&gt;Offer a written and signed agreement that NATO will never expand to Ukraine. In exchange, Russia renounces its recognition of the DPR and LPR and agrees to sign Minsk II on mixed terms (Kyiv agrees to Donbas autonomy first, and then elections are held only after Kyiv resumes sovereignty in the area). No demilitarization at all is then required for Ukraine.

Its funny that you mention Minsk I/II given that Russia refused to even admit that they were party to Minsk, refused to negotiate with the elected government of Ukraine, and blatantly broke the terms of that agreement since its inception. I think Minsk is exhibit A in my thesis that a negotiated agreement was unlikely to result in a lasting peace that includes Ukrainian sovereignty. 


&gt;Come on, that obviously was not a viable solution given what happened last week. 

As a strategy it had a pretty good run. Until Putin decided that the threat of US/EU action now was low enough that he could proceed.

&gt;I also contest your assumption that ruling out NATO membership would be a green light for Putin to roll in the tanks.

This isn't 2000s anymore the US cannot contain china with only 10 percent of its naval forces in the Pacific. China's navy has grown considerably and their navy is the largest in the world now and a lot of their ships consist of frigates, patrol ships, and corvettes.

And I disagree that Russia is harder to tank economically. We are already seeing the effects of the sanctions on the Russian economy and we can't really do the same for China without significantly hurting the US. This is because China is the second largest world economy and US largest trade partner and Russia is a economic midget compared to China globally.

China's internal issues are vast, from potential food insecurity to the decline of the working age population long before the country got wealthy. Geographically, they're pretty constrained by the island chains from projecting power. It's pretty easy for the US to support India, Japan, and Australia (potentially also the ASEAN nations) for containment, and then let China deal with their own problems.   


If it was an actual war, 10% of the US Navy could sever China's foodstuffs and energy imports, as well as access to global markets that their export driven economy relies on. It would be pretty brief assuming there wasn't madman's nuclear option in play. Russia is much more difficult to tank economically, because their economy is mostly a one-trick pony (hydrocarbons) and their people are already used to a high degree of poverty due to the parasitic oligarch class.   


Russia's military may be a bit of a joke compared to the Cold War era, but they've had a long military tradition, and plenty of contemporary experience in asymmetric warfare in Georgia, Ukraine, Chechnya, and so on. China's military hasn't realistically been tested since the late 70s when they invaded an even more impoverished, smaller, and weaker Vietnam.   


Toss in trade relationship and supply chain complications, and I'm curious what you think the US should do in terms of a China pivot?

&gt;They are invading a country of 40 million, and are involved in urban warfare. Of course there are major issues.

And when you have major issues, people start discussing the possibility this will destabilize the regime.


&gt;I’m not suggesting this isn’t happening, but don’t you think this is completely expected?

No?  I am no military expert, but those that are have pretty uniformly commented on how this cannot possibly be going how Putin expected.  Had they secured Kyiv in 48 hours and were still fighting insurgency in the rest of the country while spending down their foreign reserves, that would be much more how I would have expected it to go.

&gt;Is it though? How do we know what Putin expected?

Pretty sure Putin didn’t expect his elite paratroopers to get abandoned to die at the airport. Or he wouldn’t have sent them there. Putin’s war strategy suggests he either conceived an inexplicable hatred for his own troops and sent them to die, or he expected it to be easier.  I think that gives us some insight into his thinking.

The second article is by WSJ reporter Lingling Wei, who has a lot of contact within the Chinese bureaucracy.

Despite the vote, China isn't neutral. This vote is just to save face. China can't be a mediator,  the Ukrainians won't trust them. Only a fool would believe the Chinese are neutral. If the invasion was a success, they would have backed it.

China will most likely avoid sanctions, but its bad for China for the following reasons

* The EU is firmly behind the US. They might disagree with the US in some aspects, but they are far more likely to go along with the US on technology restrictions on Chinese companies.
* They lost Eastern Europe. Eastern Europeans will more likely follow the Lithuanians on relations with Taiwan
* The hundred of billions the Chinese spent on the BRI is pretty much flushed down the drain
* Increased dependency on Western Arms. Countries like India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia will gradually shift to Western arms or make their own.
* Increased military spending across Asia. Many nations in Asia fear it could happen to Taiwan.
* The Ukrainians gave the Taiwanese hope

[],False,,WizDub,,,[],,,,text,t2_7bnswsgd,False,False,"&gt;I don't think Biden said he won't intervene in Ukraine because he is already intervening. It is just that he said he won't send in US troops. This is distinguishable from him saying he will intervene in Taiwan because that does not necessarily mean military intervention.  
What strikes me the most is in one of his press event he said he will sanction Russia but at the same time picked options that have the least cost to the US. This indicated to me that he is not willing to pay too much political capital and have more domestic concerns. He would not risk the negative sentiment of military intervention if it have the chance to get many Americans killed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Until the president says to explicitly I am assuming he will do what is the most beneficial for America which is to send military aids to help Taiwan fight China but not directly getting involved.

By ""intervention"" in the original post, I meant direct military intervention. Biden has consistently maintained that he wouldn't send troops (""boots on the ground"") to Ukraine  - including a NATO imposed no-fly zone which would essentially be military intervention. 

I agree that the U.S. position on Taiwan has been relatively the same as with Ukraine: to send military aid to bolster the country's defenses in order to deter an invasion. The distinction I'm seeing is in how Biden handled both issues: on one hand, he *never* said the US would come to the defense of Ukraine. In fact, all three of the past administrations [withheld key aid](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/didnt-us-allies-provide-ukraine-better-air-defense-system-rcna17317) to Ukraine. Yet, on the other hand, Biden has said multiple times that we would ""intervene"" - in a real sense - if Taiwan were invaded, even though his administration back peddled the statements. 

Ultimately, it is Biden's decision to make - not his administration's - so I think this distinction speaks to Biden's deeper military commitment to Taiwan than to Ukraine even if the administration wants to maintain strategic ambiguity. 

&gt;What do you mean? The major nuclear powers are US and China getting into a direct war. None of the other counties apart from India are nuclear power. If America is seeking to get militarily involved, she will absolutely be getting all of her allies involved as well. There is no scenario where only American troops will be sent.

I 100% agree that Biden has made it a top priority to limit the impact all this has on America and American lives. I'd also point out how well he rallied our NATO allies and established an unprecedented collaborative posture - even after tons of people were saying U.S. hegemony was down the drain because of Trump.\* 

My reasoning for why the U.S. could be drawn into a Taiwan conflict alone is because if China believes the U.S. would militarily intervene if it invades Taiwan, they'd have to know that any successful assault would mean preemptively bombing American bases in Japan so they wouldn't have time to engage. China would have to bet that Japan (since it has no legal obligation to aid the U.S) would unilaterally decide not to engage even after Chinese bombs were dropped on Japanese soil. Given Japan's pacifist stance on war, this could be a real toss-up.\* 

Nonetheless, this would still mean a lot of American blood spilled just in the preemptive attack (like worse than Pearl Harbor) - giving Biden and America, in general, more justification and a rallying cry to declare war - with or without allies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\* Now that I think of it, you may be right but there's a little more nuance: An attack on an American military base would absolutely activate Article 5 with NATO but if you think about it, Russia has already given China a blueprint on how to somewhat successfully invade a NATO-adjacent country. Russia didn't have to bomb nearby NATO bases to invade Ukraine, Putin just kinda...invaded anyway? 

This is why the Ukraine crisis and Biden's performance/comments are so important. Biden was able to rally NATO to do things it hasn't done before and I can see that unity persisting even in a war, so it wouldn't make sense for China to preemptively bomb US bases because a NATO response is guaranteed. The only way they'd do this is if Taiwan surrenders before the US and NATO can mount a counteroffensive. 

But if China simply invades and (as shown by Russia's invasion of Ukraine) Taiwan puts up more of a fight, China has no way of winning because a post-Ukraine invasion world would be vitriolic to yet another autocratic invasion of a democratic country.

First, as you pointed out, Putin made certain demands. However, [Putin's demands for NATO to withdraw back to 1997 position is absurd](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato). But of course, the OP didn't provide sources, instead, like most people here, leave it to the imagination or make people use google.

Was the Iraq War about WMDs? Is Putin going to say it's really about ""Oil Deposits in the Black Sea"" or ""I don't want Ukrainians to become richer than Russians after joining the EU, because then the Russians will overthrow me""  Is he saying it to get China's backing?  Furthermore, it's in the security establishment's interest not to treat Putin like the tinpot dictator that he is, but the reincarnation of the USSR

Do you ask yourself what is Putin's chance to become the leader of the USSR if it still existed? Almost zero. If he was General Secretary,  his Dascha would be smaller than Putin's outhouse today

Secondly, it shows the militarized and very American-centric focus of the people here. It is all about NATO (ie the US)

If it was about the US why doesn't Putin invite the US and split Europe like it was during the Cold War. You have Germany, I will take Poland. You can have Finland, Russia will have dibs on the Baltics.

No one here actually cares about what the Ukrainians have to say. And what the Russian officials (ie Foreign Minister) are saying to the Ukrainians. That is why I post this article

[Here is a differing opinion Is Essentially Not About NATO](https://www.justsecurity.org/80343/russias-new-assault-on-ukraine-is-not-entirely-maybe-not-even-largely-about-nato/)

To me at least it is always been about the EU. The EU is the sword, NATO is the shield.  People here **LOVE** to demonize the EU. and dismiss it.  But for the Ukrainians, it is what they really want. You look at the polls on joining the EU, even among Eastern Ukrainians, it is a majority. For NATO they are still divided before the invasion.

If you only look at it through the lens of international diplomacy, obviously it would not make sense. 

But here's a hypothetical voter profile as food for thought:

    You're an average small town American working in manufacturing, let's say...t-shirts. Year-on-year you see your taxes go up in order to fund foreign wars and foreign aid to...Pakistan? when you yourself is struggling at home. You see the boys in your hometown being shipped off to the Middle East and returning in coffins. Adding on top of that, the company employing most of your town now decides to jump ship and set up shop in China for a 1 cent/unit price difference. Now you've got nothing but hopelessness and opioids.
    It's only a matter of time before someone reveals to you that the US does not benefit as much as Europe from these Middle East conflict as we are much less dependent on foreign oil than they are. It's only a matter of time before someone reveals to you that China only gained its economic advantage because the US enabled its ascension with close to a trillion in FDI. And once that happens, you just found the source of all your suffering, even if it's not exactly the case or only half true.

Hopefully, you can now see why people act and vote they way they do beyond painting a large segment of the population as nothing but ignorant. 

Even ardent supporters of the international order recognizes that the US bears an unequal burden compared to the other members. Their only difference from the realists is that they don't advocate for the US putting its own interests first and foremost once again. They believe the US should continue bearing that burden no matter how heavy because the overall good to the world is too great not to.

Whether you agree with realists or liberals is up to you I suppose.",5f4463de2855a3fa5e3aa1e3c809926818f8edd1,True,False,,,,,0,1646423673,,0,{},hzcvv21,False,t3_t68fio,False,True,t1_hzcqyz1,/r/geopolitics/comments/t68fio/what_was_donald_trumps_strategy_for_withdrawing/hzcvv21/,1646423685,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646394873.0,

I have to strongly disagree here. The security situation in Europe / the EU now is fundamentally different to the situation during cold war. Today, the EU is deeply ingrained into the (original) member states. There is an enormous amount of integration in economy, trade, research and also border control and security. There is no systematic conflict between any of the central European members.

I am inclined to believe this is not just a general attack on islamic people since the Uyghurs are not the largest muslim ethnicity in China, that would be the Hui.

Why would Beijing commit genocide? The lessons learned from the years of cultural revolution seem to be to let people keep their traditions. Confucianism is back , Tibetans are all fluent in their language which is taught in school and there are more than 50,000 monks in the monasteries. Everyone's culture is accepted as long as it is amplifies the parties ideological viewpoints as well. Why abandon this successful method for genocide? It does not add up.

Xinjiang is quite remote if there was a genocide we would have seen millions of refugees escaping. By 1939 ships full of Jews were docking in Canada.

I do not have issues with regards to what western media reports just their sources .An example is using Adrian Zenz as a source and Zenz is using vague documents about China building large facilities therefore genocide.

I find it hilarious that you guys have to pivot to not saying anything specific about your beliefs and resort instead to dog whistling because you've been whipped so many times by people who know what they're talking about or banned for spreading lies.  

The reason Putin invaded is because Ukraine was not invited to NATO in 2008 in order to appease Russia.  Ukraine then decided **on its own** to align itself more with the west in 2014, Putin starts sending troops into Crimea, and now this.

There was never a ""diplomatic solution"" on the table.  Ukraine was either going to be a Russian puppet state like Belarus, or it was going to be a new Russian theater.

Putin has currently a 60% approval rate on Ukraine's invasion, their contry might hurt, but that does not mean that his regime will fall.

We could end up with a North Korea situation here, with a the added difficulty that Russia could surpass all current sanctions we are imposing on them over time via China.

If Putin manages to control Ukraine he will have succeded in his plans, since his vision will be realised and his regime will endure, since modern Russia is a mayor importer of food and there's no way his population will starve.

It'll take take years, maybe decades, but Russia would emerge more militarised and full of hatred of the West and over the time, healing it's wounds and become a real power.

I know this is a long shot, and i'm hesitant to ask it because i'm not sure how serious i should take the possibility myself, but what if this is no longer true?

From the war so far we've seen russia has massive issues with troop morale, communication, vehicle maintenance, supply lines, etc.

it is almost impossible to overstate how terrible the state of the russian army is. I'm no army expert, and a lot of the takes below come from twitter and reddit sources, but they don't appear to be wrong:

- Much of the vehicles have tire issues, run out of gas, and are being stranded or blown up. There is no exception to this, as even the 'state of the art' vehicles like the pantsir-S1 end up with flat tires and left up abandoned.

- The russian airforce has been mostly MIA, with the above Pantsir being captured in-tact being a suspected partial cause, but even before that there was suspicion of a lack of guided missiles stock and problems coordinating their AA and airplanes together.

- while the russians are slowly gaining in the southern front, the Ukrainian army appears to be on the counteroffensive in the north. 

I understand the incredible scale of the russian army, and it is easy to assume they just have more and more vehicles and troops to throw at the problem, but it doesn't look like the Ukrainian army is going to run out of resources anytime soon either, with the backing of NATO countries.

If Ukraine were to succeed in pushing back further like they are starting to do on the northern front, how hard is it for Russia to launch a new offensive? Bridges will have been bombed, burned out vehicles are natural obstacles, and there is still no sign of air supriority/supremacy for Russia over Ukraine.

Again, i understand half of this may sound like a 'victory fantasy', but the hard questions regarding the state of the russian army have been asked and we haven't stopped asking them. I'm just wondering when the moment comes where we start asking whether Ukraine can keep Russia out.",f695b142fb61447fd4c3f9c2396d59ea663aa533,True,False,,,,,0,1646411367,,0,{},hzc0ac1,False,t3_t6l2bt,False,True,t3_t6l2bt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6l2bt/what_if_russia_loses_a_defeat_for_moscow_wont_be/hzc0ac1/,1646411381,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646382567.0,

&gt;Footage of an attack on a car park in Kharkiv on Monday, described by a Bellingcat researcher as a cluster bomb strike, shows residents walking in a nearby park just as the sequence of bombs go off. The area appears to be residential.  
  
Dashcam footage, assessed by Russia’s Conflict Intelligence Team to have been shot in Kharkiv, is thought to show a cluster bomb landing in a road last Friday. The driver makes a hasty U-turn as explosions rain around the car. Given the lack of aircraft noise, the bomb was probably fired by a Russian Grad rocket system, the researchers conclude.

&gt;Several NGOs have focused on an attack on a kindergarten in Okhtyrka, about 60 miles west of Kharkiv, on Friday, the second day of all-out fighting. Drone footage taken in the aftermath shows multiple blackened explosion spots, and dead or severely injured people by the entrance.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Aided by the willingness of Ukrainians and others to document the conflict on their phones, independent researchers such as Bellingcat have been able to quickly geolocate and document evidence that could be useful in the future.

I don't think truly objective analysis is possible, we all have biases, allegiances, and pre-existing positions and opinions, and actually broadly speaking those things help add context and decide what information is meaningful. No one person could process every single piece of information from a conflict like this and come up with a coherent analysis, especially with the facts changing this much. Information has to be filtered by relevance, reliability, neutrality, etc.

From my perspective as editor I'd be dishonest if I said I didn't care who wins, or I'm equally happy with either outcome. That said, Lewis's analysis is based in fact and cites sources. I don't think there is anything wrong with interrogating that analysis, but we are a diverse organisation with people from a range of countries and political backgrounds and we are not here to say 'this is what you should believe' or 'this is the side you should take'. 

We are here, as experts in the fields, to give you our perspective of what has happened and why/how, what could happen and why/how, and what broader implications events have for bigger picture geopolitics, using established fact and data. We're not always right, but we are not bending the facts to suit a narrative, we are looking at the facts and sharing how we have interpreted them. 

Our analytical credibility is what matters to us, not our political allegiances. If we said 'Ukraine is definitely going to win' and they lose horribly, then if we were partisans we would say that we did our bit. However, we're not partisans, we're analysts, it doesn't help our credibility to make claims that aren't borne out. If you see us doing that, please do call us out. The truths we think we know have to be stress tested, it's only that way that we get closer to the actual truth.

Of course that cuts both ways and if the information cited to support a criticism of our work is faulty, we will be shining a light on that too. That's the process and you're a welcome part of it if you're buying in, but not everybody does, some people are trolls just there to muddy the waters or pick a side, and we have a duty to challenge that.",1edbb83514b708dbad62c816cbff5693f492b05f,True,False,,,,,0,1646408192,,0,{},hzbsb77,False,t3_t495kh,False,True,t1_hz3xeis,/r/geopolitics/comments/t495kh/30_years_in_a_weekend_the_geopolitical/hzbsb77/,1646408204,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646379392.0,

""Putin will be unable to win this war on his preferred terms. Indeed, there are several ways in which he could ultimately lose. He could mire his military in a costly and futile occupation of Ukraine, decimating the morale of Russia’s soldiers, consuming resources, and delivering nothing in return but the hollow ring of Russian greatness and a neighboring country reduced to poverty and chaos. He could create some degree of control over parts of eastern and southern Ukraine and probably Kyiv, while fighting a Ukrainian insurgency operating from the west and engaged in guerrilla warfare across the country—a scenario that would be reminiscent of the partisan warfare that took place in Ukraine during World War II. At the same time, he would preside over the gradual economic degradation of Russia, its growing isolation, and its increasing inability to supply the wealth on which great powers rely. And, most consequentially, Putin could lose the support of the Russian people and elites, on whom he depends to prosecute the war and maintain his hold on power, even though Russia is not a democracy.

Putin seems to be trying to reestablish some form of Russian imperialism. But in taking this extraordinary gamble, he seems to have failed to recall the events that set in motion the end of the Russian empire. The final Russian tsar, Nicholas II, lost a war against Japan in 1905. He later fell victim to the Bolshevik Revolution, losing not just his crown but his life. The lesson: autocratic rulers cannot lose wars and remain autocrats.""",47eec5c9f87d4a77be3e37296ad53fcc3b0b55c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646406761,,0,{},hzbouh2,True,t3_t6l2bt,False,True,t3_t6l2bt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6l2bt/what_if_russia_loses_a_defeat_for_moscow_wont_be/hzbouh2/,1646406777,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646377961.0,

* Further, ""Xi will assert Chinese control over the island only if he is confident his military can conduct a successful amphibious invasion and if he believes the timing is right for his own career.""

But on the other hand:

* Mastro argues ""nothing Russia or its adversaries have done meaningfully alters the calculus on Taiwan,"" even though by this author's admission, ""Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has certainly changed [read: redefined all] aspects of the international order.""

The number of Russian dead is admitted by the russian government to be at least 500. Ukraine claims 5,000.

While you may believe that most of the stories about Russian disorganization are fabricated, *clearly* they are having major issues in the north that have led to surprising advantages to the Ukrainians. The lack of air support for example has puzzled almost all Western observers.  The south, with more professional troops is unsurprisingly going better for the Russians.

&gt;but the problem is most people in Taiwan may not identify themselves as Chinese. However, it does not mean they will go to front line to fight with PLA soldiers once PLA soldiers landed in Taiwan.

Unless you have a source to the contrary, [this poll says otherwise[(https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2021/12/30/2003770419). 

&gt;Taiwan is not a sovereignty country, at least not recognized by major countries. What kind of response do you believe western countries (except US) could impose a big impact on Beijing? Not much. UN cannot do anything since China will veto anything from the Security Council. Do you believe France, UK, Germany or Netherlands will deploy their military to Taiwan? Nope. The only possible players will doing something even remotely close to deploying military is US, Japan and possibly India.

The UN does not identify Taiwan as part of China. Per Resolution 2758, the UN only recognizes that the PRC is the sole representative of 'China' within the UN, and rejects the ROC (Taiwan's) claim to that title. Strictly speaking it doesn't even mention Taiwan, or the ROC, only ""the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek"".
As for the rest of this diatribe, I've literally just told you what the US, Japan and the wider free World will likely do in my last comment. You didn't even address it, how convenient. Hint, CCP members have hundreds of billions stockpiled in the West.

No relevance at all, explain how this statement is relevant.

&gt;Chinese society has a fear of dying engraving in their culture. They knew the bloody pain of the civil war. So, I am pretty sure there will be very minimal ""resistance"" after Beijing officially declare the victory.

1.) Literally the whole World will know months in advance of the CCP military buildup. Most Taiwanese youth don't identify as Chinese, this is backed up by polls. If they have the tools, they'll fight and guerilla warfare is an absolute nightmare in difficult terrain, a good deal of Taiwan fits that description

2.) Doesn't really matter much, that was all put in place by Western countries decades upon decades ago as taking down the USSR was far more important, recognising China was the pathway to that. Besides, the UK follows the Canada model and uses the term ""acknowledge"" in relation to ""the Chinese position that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China."" France purposely made no mention of its position on Taiwan at all in its joint communique with the PRC, and made it a point not to be the party initiating the severance of diplomatic relations with the ROC.

3.) Agreed, the US and the wider QUAD won't directly attack CCP forces initially, no one wants WW3.

&gt;Edit: Specifically, to the last point, damage control, fleet operations, and crew ability to “fight the ship” isn’t built in a shipyard. It comes from decades of training, shipboard damage control activities, and combat.

100 year old naval doctrine is of limited use in the current year. Additionally, these are not clandestine secrets that only certain countries can ever learn. The mentioned factors certainly do begin in a shipyard because a ship is required to perform such actions.

&gt;Take the USS Cole. That ship took a hit to the waterline, in a maneuvering lineup, that left a hole nearly 10’ in diameter. The crew was able to keep the ship not only afloat, but returned her to combat readiness. That’s the sort of thing that is generational. It’s learned though blood.

No, this is a maneuver that is performed by practice and understanding of the workings of a ship, which any competent crew can learn through practice and training. Calling it ""generational"" or ""learned through blood"" is exaggerated.

&gt;I think it's hard for people to wrap their head around this notion that you just can't buy and build your way into anything, including naval proficiency.

The start to naval proficiency is literally constructing a ship. From there, everything can be learned. Again, such experience is not esoteric secrets that only certain countries can ever possess.

But I do not support removing Russia and China at the current moment. What we need, rather, is to moderate the rhetoric about the UN's role and the importance of International Law. This includes the rhetoric from Western leaders. 

The Veto structure served the purpose of reminding us that the UN was a slow, work in progress with limited abilities. It is a feature, not a bug. It is supposed to remind everyone that there is no 'world government' to appeal to. There is no 'night watchman' of impeccable objectivity and fairness to appeal to in the anarchic international system, as Mearsheimer would put it. The same is true of International Law. These are institutions that are slowly being built, and that one day may serve the above purpose. But we are nowhere near that day yet, and it behooves us all to remember that.

The rhetoric about Russia violating international law in Ukraine annoys me to no end, for the above reason. Yes, if you violate international law, it imposes a cost, even if the cost is mostly diplomatic in many cases, typically more the case if you are a great power. That is fine for now. The law cannot order the world. Great powers still order the world, and there are indeed a different set of rules for great powers and smaller ones. That is the best we can do at the moment. 

In light of the above, if Russia is wrong for invading Ukraine, it is ultimately a judgment that one has to make on an individual level, and then that nations and groups of nations make collectively. If the West were to intervene more directly, they would be right or wrong by the same standards. One can choose to use international law as a guide, but it is not definitive. A country can be in the right and still violate international law, especially great powers trying to protect or expand an order, which is an inherently messy business. 

Imagine that North Korea decided to start massacring its people en masse. Straightforward, no apologies mass murder. So the US and South Korea decided to invade to stop it. China vetos the attack, so this is not under the security council umbrella. This might be technically illegal. It might start a war with China. Would it be wrong? Morally? Strategically? The UN and International Law are not going to tell you that. 

This is still a world ordered by Great Powers using force, or the implied threat of force. It is far from perfect. Pretending otherwise will distort your perceptions and expectations. And what is fundamental about this is to not compare what is being done to some theoretical notion of perfect fairness, which is not on the table. It is understandable when some nations complain that the Western-led order infringes on their sovereignty, or does not always abide by its own rules. But I find it very strange when some of these same people seem to wish for the end of that order for this reason, as if in a world of classic geopolitics, smaller nations would not have their sovereignty infringed upon to a far greater extent. And there would be few if any rules for the great powers to break. At least in the current order, the rules often do bind or at least restrain the great Western powers most of the time.",9f8147fa946530d4b0f52f3d7671f97bacd980d5,True,False,,,,,0,1646381247,,0,{},hzakdfl,False,t3_t5utx2,False,True,t3_t5utx2,/r/geopolitics/comments/t5utx2/time_to_revise_un_security_council_permanent/hzakdfl/,1646381264,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646352447.0,

In his mind, he had to lock in their support, and doing everything possible to gut global initiatives against climate change was the best way to do that. It’s a very easy way for him to sell the idea that he’s not going to let those “big bad globalists” steal American mining and fossil fuel industry jobs.  

There were no foreign governments or entities he was trying to appease in the case of PCD. Nobody else left the PCD. Even North Korea is part of it, which should really tell you something about the Trump movement’s regard for global solidarity and cooperation against climate threats.

As for the Iran nuclear deal, it was mainly an appeasement to Saudi Arabia and Israel, which the Trump administration considered key allies from day 1. Both are actually hostile to any cooperation or peacemaking with Iran, even if it stopped being an Islamist dictatorship, and security interests are not even the main reason why in Saudi Arabia’s case. The Saudis profit massively from the fact that Iranian oil and Iranian industry is so isolated. Trump is the most pro-Saudi president we have ever had, so there’s no surprise there. Israel on the other hand views Iran as a legitimate threat because of Iran’s funding of terrorist orgs like Hezbollah, which helps Israel in its campaign to justify why the hardworking American taxpayer should send them nearly a trillion dollars every year so that they can beef up their already powerful military.

If Iran were to ever shake the shackles off and get rid of that ridiculous regime, they’d probably eat up a great portion of Saudi Arabia’s oil market. As for Israel, I’m not too sure. I’m sure the Israelis would benefit in many ways by not having to worry about Iran, but a free and Democratic iran might also gut what is a major part of how American politicians justify such lavish spending on Israeli defense.

&gt;Findings:  
\- A surge of U.S. investor participation in China’s markets is outpacing the U.S. government’s defense against the diverse threats to U.S. national and economic security posed by U.S. investment in some problematic Chinese companies. This inflow of U.S. capital into China’s economy is occurring as the Chinese government strengthens its ability to direct nonstate firms and resources toward advancing strategic priorities that may harm U.S. interests and as Beijing further fuses military and civilian corporate operations.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- \[others\]  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Compared to portfolio investment, private equity and venture capital investment present a unique set of challenges. Critical technical knowledge, managerial expertise, and business connections often flow to the investment target in addition to funding.   
&gt;  
&gt;Lack of transparency in private transactions compounds both oversight challenges for U.S. regulators and potential risks to U.S. economic and national security interests.

Also, you are assuming Russia is going to occupy Ukrainian land post-surrender. This isn't the stated goals and Russia knows they don't have the resources to successfully do so. They will simply keep a presence in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions while installing pro-Russian officials in the government. Could the population still overthrow such a setup? Sure, they could but it would once again throw the region into war and one where the Ukrainians would be less prepared. That would be up to the Ukrainian people if they want to plunge into war constantly instead of just not joining NATO and going about life as usual. Ukraine could negotiate neutral status to keep Russia happy and then still do economic deals with the west, military buildup would just have to be off the table. That would be the ideal scenario as it would minimize bloodshed and keep the east and west satisfied, it would just be up to NATO at that point if they want to deal with a semi-Russian Ukraine.

Under no circumstances will Russia engage in a protracted war. The worst case for them is that they will obliterate key opposition cities until the Ukrainian will is broken, without NATO intervention it will only be a matter of time. No one with skin in the game wants that scenario, but the west will cheerlead the Ukrainian people into that meatgrinder with no chance of recovery in the name of weakening an enemy for their own benefit.

Ukraine has some leverage in how they shape their government if they surrender because Russia is looking to end the conflict as quickly as possible. They can use that leverage to retain the EU influence that they desire to keep.

Paris climate deal is the most useless thing ever devised. It basically stipulates that you set your own goals and you determine what punishments, if any, happen if you don't meet those goals. Literally it's not even a treaty or a deal. It's all voluntary theatrics.

  
And idk if you've noticed but Iran has been basically begging the US for a new deal ever since Trump took them off. The more desperate they grow, the better the next deal will be. Assuming the US even want a deal after they're done handling all the other stuffs going on in the world. Iran is not exactly top priority for now and the foreseeable future.

  
If you map it out, Trump would fall on the realist side of the geopolitical scale. He does whatever benefits the US directly, instead of indirectly through whatever global institution or multilateral deal in question. If you read Art of the Deal, you can see his negotiating tactics mirrored in his exchanges with foreign leaders. Whether applying hustle tactics on international diplomacy is the best idea, I'll let you be the judge of.

It seems most people are surprised that Russia has still not achieved complete air supremacy. This was expected to be a day 1 or 2 objective. This might be due to a lack of precision weapons, I feel it is most likely because they are still nervous about NATO air power and are keeping them in reserve.

Overall the UA is better supplied than other lower tier adversaries in recent conflicts (Iraq/Afghanistan/Syria), and has financial and hardware backing (not to mention intel and EW) from the West and NATO.

The main beneficiary of withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal, of course, was its most vocal opponent, Israel. Trump’s relationship with Netanyahu after he won the election was well-publicised, and Israel has always been suspicious of Iran actually adhering to the deal. Even today, when reports came in that it may be revived, current PM Bennett said that regardless of the deal, Israel will do whatever it can to keep Iran from having nukes, deal or not. Israel saw Iran’s relief from economic sanctions as a direct threat to its ability to fund Israeli enemies such as Hezbollah and Hamas.

The Saudis also benefited immensely from the withdrawal of the deal. Saudi Arabia is well known for its Sunni ideology, whereas Iran is seen as the defender of Shias in the region. In addition, both Saudi Arabia and Iran use its regional power to fund proxy conflicts as a demonstration of its power, which has clearly been manifested in the devastating crisis in Yemen today. Iran is also a major oil exporter, so keeping Iranian oil off the markets is a major win for keeping oil prices stabilised. 

The UAE also supported the withdrawal from JCPOA, due to being regional soft power competitors with Iran. 

It’s no shock that the Trump Organisation had several major projects in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE approved or initiated in the aftermath of the withdrawal. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who was also hired as a senior adviser, was also known to have a close relationship with both the Saudi Crown Prince and the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince.

The Russian economy under Putin has become dependent on the international order by means of commodity exports, and that has taken over its economy. Wheat, oil, natural gas, coal, metals. While Europe is dependent on Russia at the moment, there are many other regions of the world that can theoretically deliver these commodities. Moscow did not gain globalized power through semiconductors or technology. With population declines (and eventual demand declines) in Europe, the desire in the long term to get off fossil fuels, and the dependency on export prices, Russia and Putin feel insecure over the future. Putin does not want to be the man who reigned over Russia's decline, especially considering the collapse of Russias population in the years ahead.

It is difficult for Russia to become a manufacturing powerhouse in a globalized system due to geography. Russia has not been able to have the information and technology sectors of Moscow and St. Petersburg become major drivers of the economy. So Putin would like to follow the imperial model of the Soviet Union and force Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, to become dependent on Russia. Russia, with a declining military age population, would get a smaller border could use their resources to internal dissent. Ideally Russia would be able to get the Baltic states to anchor at the Baltic sea. Moscow and Russia would gain loads of centralized power, even if the economy declines. 

Putin might be happy with the sanctions, even though Russians will suffer Moscow will gain more control over their population in the long run.",07f7f968a413c049c1c11b206673eaa7abcaffd8,True,False,,,,,0,1646355047,,0,{},hz999aa,False,t3_t62byg,False,True,t3_t62byg,/r/geopolitics/comments/t62byg/what_is_russia_gonna_do_now_that_the_entire_west/hz999aa/,1646355066,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646326247.0,

Your hypothetical is a strange one. I’m not fully cognisant of what you’re implying? West Germany could only exist in a multipolar world, Putin it seems to me could only exist in a unipolar world. 

I am in agreement that there is a identity dimension to this conflict. Ukraine is not the Baltic’s, who historically are a frontier region. Ukraine is at the heart of East Slavic identity because of its history. Especially for a man like Putin who knows his history, the idea of Ukraine looking towards the West perhaps gives extra impetuous to his security concerns. 

Russia has definite limitations to its hard power projections because as you say it’s an underachiever economically. However, I think that military power can still makeup for economic power but the reverse isn’t true. If that were the case then NATO would have no reason to exist, the EU would be enough. 

I don’t think Russia has the capacity to maintain control over the entirety of Ukraine and given how their troops have lined up, it’s pretty obvious that they’re staying well away from Western Ukraine. 

I don’t discount democracy as a vehicle for either agency or power but like any system it can be shaped to suit whosever interests. Democratic elections are no guarantee to binding agreements, we can see this around the world, historically and contemporaneously.
