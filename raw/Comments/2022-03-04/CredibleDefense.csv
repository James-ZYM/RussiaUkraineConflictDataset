Finally, I think the initial counter attack would focus on gaining urban areas behind Russian lines by doing quick flanking maneuvers. Then setup shop in a town and cut off Russian supply lines.

Three places this could happen. First, Melitopol then move West. Second, Chernobyl. Third, Horlivaka pushing deeper, creating supply problems for Donetska. 

Doing it quickly and coordinated might be effective enough to demoralize the Russian forces to get them to surrender. Especially considering they've already committed most of the Russian troops.

[],False,,rrggrr,,,[],,,,text,t2_7adgt,False,False,"Its a mistake to view Ukraine and Taiwan in the same light and here's why in the context of your question:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The US, Japan, Australia, UK and other countries appear committed to militarily intervene in the event China moves en masse on Taiwan. It is not a conflict that would be fought by sanctions.
2. In the event of a limited-scale incursion of one of Taiwan's outlying islands the same may apply, but if the response were sanctions it would be targeted at imports from China, including crude oil, raw materials and coal. CCP member funds abroad would be frozen. As evidenced by Chinese efforts to block Aussie coal imports, China remains dependent on Western nations for imports and that will continue.
3. China's gold reserves are already among the world's largest, but in times of crisis such reserves dwindle rapidly and rarely sell at published spot prices if sold in large volume. It's not clear exporters would be inclined to accept gold under these circumstances at a price anywhere near what China paid to acquire it, nor that China could guarantee good delivery.
4. Given the West's dependence on China for so many products and materials, it's equally unlikely that Western sanctions wouldn't be met with equally punishing export controls. 

Apart from the above, you've asked what is China's view on the war in Ukraine, perhaps in general. We can't know for certain, but here's a guess:

&amp;#x200B;

1. China is probably happy to see Russia's economic power decline as it makes their raw materials less expensive, and it increases Russia's reliance on China for trade &amp; trade terms.
2. China is likely unhappy to see Russia's military struggle as it has to overcome a seemingly much weaker opponent. In part their disappointment is loss of power the growing Sino-Russian military cooperation now projects, and in part what it might say about the cost of invading Taiwan. 

If there are silver-linings to this tragedy, it would be this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Beijing is now reminded, in the starkest of terms, the cost of opposed military intervention from disruptions to normal commerce and trade, and unanticipated costs in men and materials.
2. The West is now more galvanized than ever, not just in opposition to Russia's actions, but in anticipation of what may occur in the South China Sea. Everyone is on notice in ways that can no longer be denied.

There remain serious risks that should not be ignored:

&amp;#x200B;

1. There exists a serious risk of miscalculation in Europe that results in use of tactical nuclear weapons. Why is outside the scope of my reply.
2. A severe disruption in food and energy supplies could result in civil unrest in Western nations that, aside from the terrible human cost, could be construed as an opportunity by Beijing. 

Much needs to happen quickly, but likely will not:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The United States and other Western nations must reinstate a limited draft/conscription. Doing so would match China &amp; Russia, and convey the seriousness of Western resolve in a non-escalatory way.
2. The US must lift bans on carbon fuel exploitation now to ensure energy inflation does not result in civil unrest next winter. 
3. Similar support should be given to US food supply and other critical industries.
4. The US should accept refugees from Ukraine in large numbers for those Ukrainians with skills badly needed and unmet by US workers.
5. And, finally, as crazy is I know this will sound, Canada should join the United States as a 51st state. The many reasons for this ought not be addressed in this reply, but it would be best for both countries in light of the threats and opportunities of our time.",d347d8ed9dc93fc95175f3e3e40489e18788c6e9,True,False,,,,,0,1646436682,,0,{},hzdszrp,False,t3_t6n8ds,False,True,t3_t6n8ds,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6n8ds/chinas_view_of_the_war_in_ukraine/hzdszrp/,1646436696,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646407882.0

Units rolled through half of Iraq half of the time without their heavy weapon (a Mk19) functioning because the battalion supply guy forgot to bring enough LCP. Battalion commands and NCOs hastily abandon a supply truck because of minor breakdowns leading to the loss of the battalion color/flag (morale hit) and food to the point that everyone was on 1 MRE per day for the last couple of weeks. If anyone has read the book or watched the show, Captain America and Encino Man. 

Encino man, a company commander tried to call in an artillery fire mission within 200m of his own position he was standing on. When confronted that he was trying to call in a Danger Close fire mission on top of hinself, he asked ""what's a Danger Close?"". Someone pull out a manual and read line-by-line verbatim of what Danger close was. Well, he called it anyway, but he didn't quite know how, so the fire direction centre ignored his calls. The summary is ""he was about to fuck up badly, but he fucked up the procedure to fuck that up so he didn't get the chance to fuck the original fuck up""

The soviet state was fairly good at projecting power. They just had a command economy that caused it to slowly lose out to capitalist systems that made decision in a distributed manner. So the economy of Russia continued to shrink compared to the economy of the USA and western Europe.

However, the soviet state still used a lot of money to compete with the USA in terms of military power. That worked until the economy broke down due to an overhead of weapons production during the 80s. Where the Soviet Union built up a massive military to compete against the Reagan military buildup. 

After the failed Soviet empire, the Russian economy took over, but it was controlled by corrupt leaders who extracted as much wealth out of the country as possible. They became popular because they essentially stopped the suffering in previous soviet states. 

Since the 90s to now, the Russians never implemented any serious plans to modernize their military. The reason is they were trying to extract as much wealth out of the country as possible. So even though they had some new entrepreneurs, they were heavily weighted down by the corruption. Nowhere was this more evident than the military, because it seems like all the extra funds were diverted to military commander's bank accounts. 

So we're seeing the result of 3 decades of a corrupt military. It seems like 90% of the weapons fielded were produced in the 70s and 80s.

From all that I have read, this is impractical for a number of reasons. Even e.g. Poland sends a bunch of the planes Ukraine is already flying (Mig-29, etc) that doesn't mean Ukrainian pilots can hop in and fly them, or that Ukrainian ground crews would have the parts or expertise to keep them in the air.

Fighters are more like a ""platform."" They go through a lot of revisions and upgrades throughout their lifespan, and the upgrade path is not linear, with various air forces pursuing their own disparate upgrades. Even the ""Supermarine Spitfire"" was in reality many dozens of different models.

Bottom line is, it takes a lot of training for pilots and crews to be competent with these revisions and there's no chance of that happening. Sending somebody into the hostile skies in an unfamiliar jet is not helpful.

I’m not saying the Russians were totally incompetent nor that they wouldn’t be a threat to NATO, but I can’t help but get the impression that the technology gap may be greater and more impactful than Kofman seems to believe. Certainly we made similar mistakes in the Iraq war and occupation, but would a US lead invasion have a stuck convoy, a lost MP detachment drive miles past the front line into the heart of a hostile city, or totally unsupported armor or AA advancing into city streets?",b07219dcc5814dbf03133d687d5b0eb65ffe5766,True,False,,,,,0,1646432690,,0,{},hzdjbeu,False,t3_t6m1a8,False,True,t1_hzc45cp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6m1a8/one_week_in_an_operational_assessment_of_the_war/hzdjbeu/,1646432705,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646403890.0

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"&gt;As for historic examples of the Russian army screwing things up: in WWI, the allies essentially bailed them out. With food, weapons, ammo, medical supplies, you name it. Russia still spent millions of lives against Nazi Germany, and their army was on its last legs as they were pushing into Berlin.

I think you meant WW2, and this distorts the history considerable. While it's true the red army was a mess at the start of the war, largely due to the Bolshevik purge of officers in favor of proletariate ideology. However, as the war progressed that changed. By sheer survival vs attrition leaders started emerging, and Stalin/Khrushchev were smarter than Hitler in realizing they needed to trust their officer core vs micro managing. The red army re-adopted the pre Bolshevik concepts of Deep Operations and started putting them to use very effectively.

A major motivation for the Normandy invasion was exactly because the other allies feared the red army wouldn't stop at Berlin. At the time of the race to Berlin, the conclusion of the war was foregone. The question indeed was who would end up ruling Europe after the fall.

While lend/lease and economic support was vital to the Russian war effort, it's a mistake to characterize red army at the end of the war the way you have. This same army that was ""on its last legs"" immediately pivoted to route all of Manchuria in just 30 days. They were \*very\* capable by the end. This is important to understand as it's what drove us into the cold war so fast.

In any case, extrapolating what happened in WW2 to today is just not relevant either.

So a Chernobyl scenario isn't going to happen, but something like Fukushima could.

The containment vessels on these reactors are likely strong enough to take direct hits from artillery, though obviously not indefinitely, and there's plenty of key equipment outside containment (namely backup generators).

Putin has little to lose at this point from continuing aggression since he's already so heavily sanctioned and the world has made it clear that they will not directly oppose him militarily.

I'm not sure this will change your view. Ukraine already gave up territory (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk) and Putin is back for more 8 years later. So Zelensky gives up some more territory to buy a couple of years of not-open-warfare, until Putin has time to put his military back together and come for the rest of it. I think Ukrainians know how this story goes and that's informing their will to resist the invasion. Zelensky has said in public that Ukraine cannot win this militarily, not without Europe's military intervention. I'm sure everyone fighting for Ukraine is aware of this, and yet, they are fiercely resisting and fighting. Effectively, they have nothing to lose. I think they are convinced that they are going to lose their country whether they concede or fight. I think the whole world is doubtful that Russia is willing to negotiate in good faith anyway, so is Zelensky really a fool for not wanting to concede? Sitting here in my warm home far away from this war, I'm not ready to pass that judgment. In my opinion, there's a reasonable chance that the calculus may change for Russia pretty quickly given the sanctions and isolation they are now facing. If the will of the people is still to fight, waiting it out a bit longer seems strategically reasonable.

Zelensky has already warned that Putin isn't going to stop a Kyiv; he's coming for Berlin. You can attribute that to a desperate leader desperately trying to convince NATO and Europe to help Ukraine (and they are helping), but I don't think the man is wrong about Putin. And I think NATO and the European nations watching closely and making plans behind closed doors. 

I don't think it's been made clear that the the rest of the world is not willing to oppose Russia militarily, but right now this is playing out within the Cold War paradigm of proxy wars instead of direct military confrontation of nuclear armed nations. I think that changes pretty quickly if Putin steps out of that paradigm and attacks any NATO member. In my opinion, Putin was quick to pull a Kim Jong Un style nuclear ultimatum because he know this move makes him vulnerable and if he draws NATO into this conflict there's no way he will survive it. Unfortunately, he may be enough of a madman that most of the world doesn't survive it either. But, I don't think the threat of nuclear weapons means that NATO is going to let Putin restore the USSR.

Now that they've done it, it's harder to say what Russia would do or not do. It's clear that Russian leadership either doesn't understand or doesn't care much about the international consequences of their actions. In either case, that significantly raises the possibility of then doing other horrible things that would inflame anti-Russia sentiment around the world.

==== Limited consequences ====
As long as Russia isn't invaded, it seems vanishingly unlikely that any Russian leaders will actually be sent to prison for any war crimes. As long as Russia has a viable strategic nuclear arsenal, and as long as they don't attack NATO countries, it also seems extremely unlikely that anyone will invade them. Together, these mostly limit consequences for their actions to what has already happened. Full trade embargoes and expansion of sanctions to other countries are still on the table, but their incremental effect has been dulled by the heavy sanctions already applied.

==== National imperatives ====
Russia has bitten off more than it can chew. Ukrainian forces outnumber the Russian forces, and Russia is nowhere close to having committed the manpower it will need to occupy Ukraine. With heavy sanctions against Russia and unprecedented western support of Ukraine, including thousands of veteran volunteers and shipments of advanced weapon systems like Javelin missiles and TB2 drones, there is a real question of whether or not Russia will be able to win. If Russia is pushed out of Ukraine, would the conflict end at the border or would Ukrainians push further into Russia with Western support to ensure that the people responsible for the war are captured and brought to justice?

That brings us to a potentially risky scenario. Suppose Russian leaders see that they are losing in Ukraine as a large Ukrainian/international force pushes them back across the border, with aspirations of pushing into Russia to bring war criminals to justice. If Russia has little to more to lose, and Russian leadership either doesn't understand or doesn't much care about international consequences, would they decide to use tactical nuclear weapons on the advancing Ukrainian force while they are still on their side of the border? From what they've proven willing to do so far, it's not clear that the answer is 'no'.",cb9340768354e9cc3228f2d8aba680c1b6b3197f,True,False,,,,,0,1646422477,,0,{},hzcspm3,False,t3_t6jvqb,False,True,t1_hzck7ao,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6jvqb/ukraine_megathread_march_4/hzcspm3/,1646422495,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646393677.0

[],False,,ringthorn1,,,[],,,,text,t2_13iiix,False,True,"Hi, thanks for your question. 

To the first part of your question, source 4 provides estimates for required Soldier to civilian ratios in a city with an active insurgency. It states that for every 1,000 inhabitants in an area, you would ideally want 20-25 Soldiers dedicated to counterinsurgency (and all its entailed sustainment requirements). Kherson had a population of 283,000 people, which we generously divide in half to represent people who have left their homes to avoid the war, leaving us at 141,500 remaining. Not every person left is an active combatant, but as we often see with insurgencies, members of the local population provide aid for insurgents due to personal/ideological connections. In addition to local support, we're seeing overwhelming international social and material support (though how long that lasts is yet to be seen).

Now to your point about Russian success in Chechnya, we need to preface that discussion by comparing the events of the conflict before and after the signing of the Khasavyurt Accord.

Prior to the Accord, the political goals of the Chechen forces was independence from Russia. Once they lost their cities, their military leaders utilized guerilla warfare and daring raids into Russian territory as means to achieve these policy goals. These raids had the added effect of rallying popular support among the Chechen populace, as they demonstrated that Chechen forces could still strike Russian forces across a broad front. This first war culminated in August 1996 when Chechen forces retook Grozny from the Russians, killing or capturing their Soldiers there. This forced then President Yeltsin to sign the Khasavyurt Accords which provided autonomy for Chechnya.

The inter-war period was chaotic. Socio-political divides caused various commanders to compete with one another, leading to a breakdown in the rule of law. During this time, raids were still conducted into Russian territory, leading to the second war. Important to note in this war was the presence of the Islamic International Brigade (IIB), led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab (who was of the Wahabi sect and in command of foreign Islamic fighters in Chechnya).

Russia initiated its assault on Chechnya with an aerial bombing campaign, while cutting of southern egress routes and committing to brutal block by block combat. Chechen forces in Grozny were forced to retreat through a minefield, under heavy artillery fire. The Chechens suffered massive casualties, including several senior leaders from the first war. Two months later at the Siege of Komolskoye, Chechen leader Ruslan Galaev and as many as 800 Chechens Soldiers were killed or captured.

These two events were a serious blow to Chechen manpower and command. New leaders stepping up to fill the gap held increased radical Islamic views. It is at this point that we begin to see the political goals switch from Chechen independence, to jihad. The terrorist attacks on the Nord-Ost Theater in 2002, and the Beslan School Siege in 2004 where hundreds of Russian children died, destroyed support for Chechen fighters at home, and abroad.

This loss of public support is fatal for an insurgency, and it is why the Russians began to receive support from locals. I don't assess Ukraine to be in a similar situation, and I don't see it heading that way as long as the messaging we have been seeing from president Zelensky framing Ukraine as a fight for independence is enforced as policy. I especially don't see the Russians building and maintaining support especially if [THESE](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/invading-russian-soldiers-are-raping-women-in-ukraine-foreign-minister-warns-130724653.html) allegations are true.

But let me let you in on an open secret - cyber warfare with the gloves off can get really ugly FAST.  State nations wouldn’t go for DDOS attacks against some cheesy .gov website.  No sir, that is the kiddie stuff… here is what a real cyber war would be:

- crash the stock market
- crash the credit card companies and banks
- disable the power grid and cause nuclear power plant to explode
- cause self driving cars to ram into each other going 120 mph all simultaneously
- water companies would start poising their citizens
- hospital and police databases and computers would be full of malware
- ISPs and Cellphone towers would be bricked
- Railroads and traffic lights could either be set to be malicious or disabled
- Oil refineries and gas pipelines would start exploding and killing their workers

It would be total chaos.  Some of these events have already been tested but not on a large scale.

Russia attempted to hack Tesla’s central server that sends out updates to all cars.  Russia also hacked a state of the art Gas refinery in Saudi Arabia nearly causing it to explode and knocked out the Ukraine power grid with malware.  The USA has deeply embedded malware in all sorts of electronics and has lots of back doors everywhere.

Mining before the (imminent) invasion : 
- you guarantee to the separatists and Russia that you're going to remain within your shrunken territory and give up the defense of this perimeter. 
- you give geopolitical ammo to Russia's ""responsibility to protect"" casus belli, since you're drawing internal borders with undiscriminate explosive ordnance against a russian ethnic minority. I'm not making a statement on whether or not this is a legitimate argument, but one which Russia would gleefully expose to the international community.  

Mining after the invasion :
- Same problem, you give Russia more leeway to negociate the territory that Ukraine is bordering with mines
- You have the choice to mine the 300km border with the separatists, which means that your mine line is flanked slightly north of Luhansk by Russia and the separatists, risking having your positions being outflanked Maginot-style. 
- or you can mine the entire-claimed Donbass border, this is even worse since you're giving up the first stage of the war and allowing the establishment of a puppet state.

As for historic examples of the Russian army screwing things up: in WWI, the allies essentially bailed them out. With food, weapons, ammo, medical supplies, you name it. Russia still spent millions of lives against Nazi Germany, and their army was on its last legs as they were pushing into Berlin.

My assessment is essentially if the ukrainians can fall back to a defensive position where relative  equilibrium can be held, that would a) be a major achievement and b) represent a fighting chance of changing the equation in their favour.

Currently (it appears) they are elimiating russian hardware and units faster than their own units are being destroyed. So if equilibrium can be forced, this is in their fscour where the numbers are not.

This plus the taps opening on the types of military help they have requested from the west. There is a limited window for dostribution now, but if advances can be halted, even for a time, distribution and training can provide an added advantage.

Of course, key to this highly optimistic scenario is the air. I do not see the russian advances stopping without aerial help. We do not know what is being provided.

They could still claim to have protected the Russian-speaking populations in East Ukraine and expanded their territory to include a buffer against NATO, without the disastrous occupation and insurgency that would result from trying to take and hold Kiev or all of Ukraine. 

I don't know if this was Putin's original goal, but it seems to be the best option for everyone right now. In a few years, the world would probably get back to business as usual and accept the DMZ and West/East Ukraine split as a fait accompli. It's a moral loss, but the longer this drags on, the more likely, numerous, and severe the war crimes will become.

&gt;Occupation of Crimea is enough reason for NATO to not let Ukraine in.

NATO is not a defensive alliance, it lost that title the day it attacked Yugoslavia without the backing of the UN no matter how good intentioned the decision was.

Why can Russia be concerned about their safety, but Ukraine cannot? Ukraine has every right if not more to militarize and invade Russia.

The stronger has always dominated the weak and its their interests that take precedence over the weaker ones, that's the way of the world. This geopolitical loop has and will always be relevant.

It would be a difficult decision to make psychologically as well. And I think that aspect and how it influences not only decision making but also perceptions of the situation an evaluation of intel. 

The Ukrainian generals may be from the area east of the Dnieper,  have family there. or may have been stationed there and feel a loyalty to the people that could lead them to try to justify and believe they could hold the area despite the obvious risk. Added to that is the knowledge that if they give up that large area with millions of Ukrainians they simply will never have the military strength to take it back from the Russians. 

I've only skimmed the article and did a control F to search for refugees and civilians and came up with nothing. I'm curious if the wargame included those as factors? Fighting on your own land has advantages but many disadvantages as well. The appeal of at least fighting delaying actions to allow civilians to flee the area if they can must be a hard thing for Ukrainian command to say no too despite the huge risk of encirclement. 

The impact upon morale is also a consideration. The soldiers based in the east of ukraine likely have their wife and kids living nearby. So withdrawing dependents from the area adds a logistical challenge to a withdrawal. But *for command I think the danger is to be overly optimistic about your ability to hold and to ignore or explain away intel that challenges that hope.*

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"No not really. Prewar Ukrainian inventory allows for only 29 mechanized brigades at most, and each of these would have only half the firepower and armored vehicles of a standard Russian Motor Rifle Brigade. Ukraine has hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles in storage but to take them out requires a refit which can't be done in short order, especially not while the whole country is under aerial and missile bombardment. Why is this important? There are basically two ways to carry out a conventional offensive now adays. 

Approach 1 involves infantry functioning as de facto ""reconnaissance in force"" assets for artillery (and aircraft, but that's not relevant to Ukraine). Once they make contact with the enemy, they, with the help of drones, ID enemy positions for artillery strikes. The efficacy of artillery follows the law of diminishing marginal returns, in that the first seconds of an artillery barrage will kill a lot of men, the next seconds fewer, and so on. Some armies still practice hours-long artillery barrages, but this is erroneous: by the time artillery has been firing for hours, the artillery would be lucky to be killing 1 enemy infantryman per 5 or even 10 shells fired. A short barrage has 2 functions, to either 1) soften up the enemy position for a charge by infantry and armored vehicles, or 2) force the enemy to withdraw from their position. #2 happens far more often than #1.

Approach 2 involves a mass of tanks and APCs converging on a positioning and overwhelming local defenses. I say converging because armies today have weapons capable of delivering fire over a huge area of effect, such as MLRS and cluster bombs. It would be stupid both for a huge armored-mechanized force to approach as a single body, and stupid for them to remain as a single body post-breakthrough. Divided drive is also important to manage logistics: the more roadways the armor and mechanized forces converge from, the easier they all are to supply, and the faster they can move. We can call this approach ""mechanized shock"". Shock is not a word often used in modern military manuals, but it refers to the demoralizing effect that facing impossible odds has on a defender. Most people think of ""shock"" either as shock and awe (a huge bombardment), or a surprise attack, but it's neither of those things. Shock is the realistic response to those movie scenes where the army of the good guys in Hollywood movies is faced with an enemy many times their size. In real life, people don't hold firm and die heroically in those situations unless they're Japanese - they withdraw.

Today, shock can only realistically be imposed by armored vehicles. Legions of infantry moving across a field can be cut down by artillery and automatic weapons: a few dozen tanks and APCs cannot. These vehicles must be destroyed by defenders one by one using ATGMs and AT guns. If they're terrible, RCLs and AT rifles might do the trick... might. Attackers and defenders in this situation know that, if the defender holds firm, the attacker will suffer heavy losses. But, due to the number of the attackers, they can be reassured that still in that case most of them will survive. The defender knows that, regardless of his choice in the face of such an onslaught, he will certainly die and there will be no survivors.

*Every* well-managed offensive in the past twenty years has followed one of these two models. What happened to the old infantry-centric offensives? Why can't Ukraine just pull a Malaya on the Russians? Because now adays most armies are fully mechanized. Assume Ukraine summons the ghost of Yamashita, who maneuvers tens of thousands of territorial defense forces and commandos deep behind Russian lines. They take advantage of Russia's lack of NODS to crush their infantry in night attacks... and then what? The Russians counterattack the next morning, bringing tanks and APCs. Ukraine's troops know the answer to this: Javelin and NLAW... except there aren't nearly enough of these available to destroy all the Russian vehicles. More cannot be sent, because such ""disruptive"" infantry operations are disruptive in both directions: neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians can be supplied until either the enveloped Russian front, or the Ukrainian rear penetration elements, are destroyed.

This is why localized counterattacks by the Ukrainians are possible and will happen, but a sustained, operational counterattack will not happen until Russia runs out of money, fuel, and ammunition, or until its army deserts en masse. To conduct approach #1, this ""fire support creep"", you need more artillery than the enemy, especially self-propelled: to do this, you need to win counter-battery duels where SPA is king. Russia has the most SPA in the world. To conduct approach #2, you need mechanized and armored forces. Ukraine has them, but Russia has far more. Any breakthrough caused by shock will be reduced by a Russian counterattack using the same methods.",84bd45b18633d3d97f88cdfca84e545d18e8aa34,True,False,,,,,0,1646410173,,0,{},hzbx97v,False,t3_t6fpau,False,True,t3_t6fpau,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6fpau/can_ukraine_counter_attack/hzbx97v/,1646410189,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646381373.0

&gt; What trends can we learn from the tactics Russian forces have employed? What can we learn about Russia’s strategic objectives and operational approach in the campaign? What tools, equipment, and other resources have been most important for defending forces? What role have drones, antitank weapons, and other systems played? What have been the effects of the broad-based international response in support of Ukraine? Participants engage with these questions and more during a fascinating and insightful discussion.

That being said, risk is never nil. The problem with low probability, high impact scenarios is that if you're at that end of the probability tail, you're inherently in a place where a lot of your core assumptions are no longer applicable. For example, restraint and rationality are kind of inherent assumptions during normal times that can easily go out the window in a conflict zone. You're effectively trying to predict stupid and roll that into your estimates. Assumptions about engineering or operations are just as flimsy when you're already in a low probability situation like armed conflict.

To use a geopolitical example, we can look at the risk of Putin deploying a nuclear weapon in the current conflict. The general consensus is that it's not at all likely to happen, but people are still very concerned because a) the potential consequences are so dire and b) it's unclear if the core assumptions regarding MAD etc. are still applicable to the situation. It may not seem like a lot, but for high impact scenarios it's a huge deal for risks to jump from less than 1% to 5% or the uncertainty around your risk predictions to increase in ways you can't calculate.

There is *some* historical debate about the extent to which the atomic bombings led to the surrender of Japan - with others pointing to the Soviets joining in the war in the Pacific and the continued blockade/conventional bombing of Japan holding significant sway. 

The numbers are not what makes it terrifying, it's the cost-effectiveness of such weapons. Before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, you needed fleets of strategic bombers to cause a similar level of destruction over many hours. Now you needed 1 plane and mere seconds.

The first atomic weapons also pale in comparison to the thermonuclear weapons of modern nuclear forces. Smaller tactical weapons were removed from the East/West arsenals by mutual agreement *because* there was a real threat that they would tempt leaders to use the weapons on a 'smaller scale'.

The use of H-bombs can't really be normalised. The level of destruction they bring exceeds most military objectives and this is why they're obtained for 2 reasons. To ensure nuclear weapons are not used against you, and to guarantee the continued sovereignty of your nation.

A-bombs were a step-change in warfare, but they probably would have been used in future conflicts had that been the limit of the atom's power, the development of hydrogen bombs has ensured that they will never be 'normalised'.

Lol, you accuse me of not understanding macroeconomics? Let me explain something to you. Cheap oil stimulates economic growth. Cheap oil is supplied by pumping out more oil. Countries with a lot of oil can decide how much oil they want to pump and therefore are able to influence global supply and thus global economic growth.

If we want to revive the global economy, getting major oil producers to agree to pump more oil to lower prices and thus increase economic growth would be the way to go. Russia, as a major oil producer, has a big vote on this matter. If Russia has a big vote on reviving the global economy after a pandemic, then that means they can ask a lot in return for pumping oil. They were bargaining kickstarting the global economy in exchange for Ukraine. Do you understand now?

In addition to this, the Iran Nuclear Talks are ongoing as well, and so their hand has been dramatically strengthened since Europe needs to get its gas from somewhere. And as it so happens Iran is the second largest gas producer in the world.

a blockade is a unilateral action to prevent access to SOMEONE ELSE'S market BY OTHERS, through KILLING UNARMED TRADERS (since if you're not going to kill them how will you stop trade ships from simply ignoring your blockade?). this is unambiguously an act of war from just about every possible angle you look at it.",04e7ab1207980ee8a3b99daa5f79f59a0a006448,True,False,,,,,0,1646398206,,0,{},hzb6suj,False,t3_t62t7y,False,True,t1_hza056z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t62t7y/why_are_the_norms_for_cyber_attacks_so_different/hzb6suj/,1646398224,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646369406.0

I'm not sure that's especially fair? Most of the rhetoric I've seen has been people being completely bemused *because they expected Russia to do better*. There were broad presumptions that it was all over when that helicopter assault on the airport near Kyiv initially succeeded on day one. Then people were presuming that Russia would win when they retook it. Then it was when the Northen Group reached the outskirts of Kyiv And so on.  

Ultimately, the Russian approach here *has* exhibited a lack of tactical capability - or at the very least an apathy to tactical prowess. The very best thing you could possibly say of leadership at various levels is that it has been 'by the numbers'. But even that's kind. 'By the numbers' leadership wouldn't involve feeding VDV into hopeless assaults repeatedly, or flying troop carrying aircraft low and slow over a city with active air defences, or not telling your frontline forces that they were going into combat at all.

The desertions thing might be overstated, but we've got an awful lot of video of captured people who confirm they're conscripts, confirm they didn't want to be there, and confirm they didn't even know it was an nvasion they were participating in.

Nothing makes sense here. This war is neither beneficial to Russia, nor to Putin. He must have known that this will isolate Russia for decades. The fact that the price of the war itself is higher than expected does not even go in to this equation. Just the economic sanctions, which are 100% expected, should be enough to convince a rational Putin to not attack.

Is Putin really so naive that he thinks the power of a land is determined by how much land they control?

There is also no personal gain. In fact, he just increased the likelihood of a Russian revolution against him from 1% to like 10%. Still pretty low, but something to take serious. He could live the last 10-25 years of his live like a billionaire without worrying about a thing. But now there is the non zero chance of a revolution against him.

But as far as why the norms are different, there are a bunch of factors that feed into it:

* Attacks are rarely directly visible to the public. This doesn't mean they aren't significant or damaging, just, it doesn't provoke an immediate mass public response the way rocket attacks or troops crossing the border do.
* Attribution can be tough. It's pretty common that after a public attack is divulged, for all practical purposes we know who did it (APTs tend to reuse techniques, trojan frameworks, etc) but in the sort of smoking gun sense that would let you walk into the UN demanding action, or would justify going to war in global media.
* The organizations doing this are often criminal organizations that have the de facto support of the sponsoring government, but would be deniable by that same government if scrutinized.
* Attacks happen constantly. Major companies, particularly banks, get hit all the time. For every Maersk hack you hear about, there's probably 50 you don't.

[],False,,i_rae_shun,,,[],,,,text,t2_120byurl,False,False,"I can 100% understand why Russia feels threatened by NATO even though NATO as an alliance is at least, on paper, a defensive alliance. In the broader lens of history, there's not too much use trying to make powers abide to what is morally correct unless its an unnecessary abuse (like genocide or mass killing). Otherwise, in the calculus of ""doing"" vs ""not doing"", there is only benefit and cost.

From the point of view of the U.S or a western alliance, the question of Ukraine is a precedent setting event. It's not so much the invasion by itself that is a problem. It's when you use nuclear response as a threat to get your way that is more concerning. If you show your adversaries that you let them get away with using the threat of nuclear war as deterrence, then they can get away with anything as long as they threaten the use of nuclear force.

In addition, I find the use of ""bottom line"" is absurd. When Cuba became a communist nation, there was probably hysteria and ""this is my bottom line"" kind of thinking. Turns out, it didn't really matter what they were. They couldn't influence the U.S much. I'm not sure the Soviet Union saw Afghanistan as a ""bottom line"" scenario but one can argue that the repercussions of their endeavors there was one of the reasons that led to its collapse. Anything that you term as too great a loss can be called bottom line. In reality, maintaining the status quo of a place like, say, Taiwan, isn't going to collapse the CCP even though China says that's their bottom line.

That's why I say I understand why Russia does what it does but it doesn't change the fact that, if you want a strong western alliance, and if you want your global hegemony unchallenged, then being weak about having a forceful response - especially since it most definitely favors you in the eyes of Ukraine and the world - is not a great choice.",ea0fd4052f55e7d8a58ef8186b77382867370580,True,False,,,,,0,1646367027,,0,{},hz9xssr,False,t3_t5u8mc,False,True,t1_hz9j8j6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t5u8mc/assessing_the_russian_military_campaign_in/hz9xssr/,1646367040,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646338227.0

However, regardless of racial and civilizational perceptions, the successful execution of war lies upon the successful integration of command and control, maneuver, sustainment, intelligence, fires, and protection. We have seen the Russians fail to integrate or even plan some of these key requirements.

 talked about. Also, He talks about no combat experience for pilots in VKS(Russian Aerospace Forces) because experience in Syria doesn't equate to combat operations in Ukraine.    
  
In the Su-57 part of the video, he talks about the aircraft being better than 4th gen aircraft (with respect to stealth technology). which isn't really surprising. But it still dwarves in comparison to an f22 or f35. (He conveniently forgets to mention that there are only 14 of them, 10 of which are in testing phase 4 in serials )  
  
In the third part of the video, he talks about Short wavelength and long wavelength frequencies, and a combination of both to give pilots and missiles an accurate position of enemy threats. In the same part, he talks about Typhoon or Rafale being able to take down a Su-35. But it would be hard with a defence air network (s-400 or s-300 v4)   
  
In the last part of the video, he talks about plans to modernize the VKS. Does he talk about Su-74? and Su-70(UAV) and Sukhoi acquiring Mikoyan... He also talks about UAVs not being secure citing RQ-170 as an example(Iranians detected its presence and hacked it, took control of it).

It is certainly plausible as a factor in keeping the troops in the dark. Given a heads up on the plans the troops might have started talking amongst themselves and reinforced each other's reluctance to fight and kill Ukrainians. Even for all the soldiers from the Russian far east I can't help but think that it is very difficult to think of them as the other. Despite the rhetoric of claiming they're Nazis. And the soldiers being on military exercises in the lead up would mean that there was less time to indoctrinate them with propaganda. 

But once they are there and people are shooting back, the assumption would be that they'd fight. As they have for the most part, but not with any particular zeal. And civilians telling them to go back home hits at the story of liberating these people. 

All I've said is speculation of course. And it could just be the Russian army's disregard for educating the boots on the ground about the overall mission. The top down leadership model that distrusts individual or small unit improvisation. 

I suspect it may not have even occured to the commanders in the know that by not informing their grunts it would handicap their operations. In fact, I lean towards that perspective that it just never even occurred to them and if they did think about then they thought it could only cause trouble, so it's easier to leave them in the dark.

But apparently Russia's demands were crazy, not just ""don't join NATO"" but not seeking adequate arms for self-defense, disrespecting Budapest and borders, etc.  I think Putin has gotten away with being a bully for so long that he drank his own Kool-Aid and though Ukraine would be a cakewalk even after 2014.",cff35bb8efe815a192ab474d96be4b2193858c7e,True,False,,,,,0,1646352880,,0,{},hz94epp,False,t3_t5qvsx,False,True,t1_hz7zfka,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t5qvsx/ukraine_megathread_march_3/hz94epp/,1646352897,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646324080.0

Thanks for this.

I think this one sentence is the most eloquent way I have yet seen to summarize what 21st century warfare is going to be.

Modern weapons allow a military to basically delete any target within the AOE if they have accurate coordinates. 

Even foot soldiers with a javelin can delete a tank as long as they are within 2 miles and a clear line of sight. Thermal imaging satellites can tell the folks on foot where to post up and wait.",b83843451507f3158b1a4c65b51fa4605e69a6f3,True,False,,,,,0,1646352339,,0,{},hz936z3,False,t3_t5qvsx,False,True,t1_hz7ricp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t5qvsx/ukraine_megathread_march_3/hz936z3/,1646352356,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646323539.0

[],False,,Lampwick,,,[],,,,text,t2_432l4,False,True,"&gt; That assumes that capturing kyiv quickly is a priority goal. Maybe. Maybe it isn't.

Their failed air assault mission to capture Antonov Airport near Hostomel doesn't fit with *any* ""maybe it isn't"" scenario.

&gt;Maybe Putin just wants a credible enough threat to split Ukrainian defenses from elsewhere.

UA was *already* heavily concentrated in the south due to Crimea and Donbas. There's really nothing to ""split"". Even if they were, why would their strategy be to have a bunch of ineffective soldiers run out of fuel and food halfway to Kyiv, leaving all their equipment sitting ducks for militia volunteers to blow up, or for farmers to tow away with tractors?

 This ""maybe, maybe not"" argument is entirely unconvincing because there is no alternate plan that fits the facts and *doesn't* include taking Kyiv. ""We don't know"" is not a counterargument to ""this looks like a failed attempt to take the capital city"". 

&gt;we can't assume it isn't doing what was expected.

Galvanizing the entire country to take up arms by threatening to take Kyiv, leaving the president to go on TV every night and rally the citizens to take up arms, spurring the entire western world to economically curbstomp Russia, and leaving gaggles of mystified Russian conscripts lost and hungry in enemy territory can pretty much be 100% classified as ""not what Putin expected'.
