* escalate - declare war, mobilize million people with AK47s, go for human wave attacks, or whatever - there are many problems with this route, but that's literally the only way Russia can even hope to achieve any sort of ""win""
* try to go on defence - which given how balance of forces is changing is a losing proposition, it could be anything from slow push to total collapse of Russian army, but Russia has nothing left really 
* cut the losses and offer Ukraine ""everything back except Crimea"" kind of a deal (really unlikely Ukraine would take ""Feb 23 lines"" kind of deal at this point)

US urban ops isn't based on US cities as we don't fight in them, we fight in foreign cities.

Our doctrine focuses on ops in every type of villages, to suburbs up to megacities, which are so daunting that it's creating controversy since to discuss megacity urban ops means entire corps or even field armies inside them at once, which means a significant part of the entire active duty force structure can be involved dealing with a single city.

Gildeer on Feb 23rd - *Occams Razor. Either famously incompettent russia is pulling off a flawless campaign of hiding their true intent - or Russia really isn't going to invade Ukraine*.

You're laying yourself completely open to even the most badly implemented propaganda campaigns imaginable.

&gt;Since the videos in the alleged ""Lviv"" and ""Zakarpattia"" show streets and buildings, and since no one from these populous cities ever said ""wait a minute, this is not my city"" - then we can safely assume that these are indeed videos from Lviv and Zakarpattia.

Nothing I said above said that they were not. Only that, I guessed (not having seen them) that they wouldn't appear to be filmed and distributed organically as you might expect a real appeal to be .... they appear to be filmed and distributed entirely through Ru Media/Government sources. Are they ?

Because, I'm searching for ""lviv protests"" and even ""lvov protests"" on twitter..... and I haven't seen a damn thing so far. I'd expect an organic protest movement in Ukraine to be, ya know, posting videos of their protest on twitter but so far.....nothing.... which seems weird.

Are these video's *only* appearing on pro-Ru telegram channels ? Why aren't they on twitter, coming from normal ukranians accounts ?

Why do you think that might be ?

&gt;Same for the street protests in pro-separatist areas.

Again, if they were true organic protests.... you'd expect Ukranians, releasing material through Ukranian accounts, to be driving the narrative.

Where is it ? Is it really all entirely on pro-Ru telegram ?

&gt;Since the videos are actually from those cities then the only way this could be a conspiracy is if somebody hired mobs to gather and protest there, in Lviv and Zakarpattia. Which is unlikely, to put it mildly.

Why is it unlikely?

No, not ergo.

[],False,,Acies,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mz6e,False,False,"&gt;Ukraine is actually in a worse position if you're looking at the length of the border it needs to defend and the complexity of that defence. Their defence needs to be orchestrated in 3 different directions as opposed to Finland which only has to worry about their (long) Eastern border. Finland is ""thinner"" so it's vulnerable to being cut in half from a concentrated assault but it at least can't be pincered like what the Russians attempted to do in Ukraine with attacks from Belarus, Crimea, Donbas, and from Russia itself.

Sure, and the length of the border is important. Finland actually has even more of an advantage here because it's major population centers are all in the south, so it's unlikely there would be fighting along the whole border and Finland could focus on defense of the southern part of the country.

But the main point in trying to make about the geographical distances has to do with how they influence strategic planning. Resources I've seen, and this seems to be supported by the war in Ukraine, say they Russia has a range of about 100 miles to extend into another country before their logistics falls apart. This limitation was central to the Ukrainian defense. In basically all directions during the initial offensive, they let the Russians advance those 100 miles, then started harassing their supply lines. That was the plan, tailored to Ukrainian geography, and it worked really well. A key part of it, though, is that Ukraine is about 400 miles tall about maybe a thousand miles wide, so after you stretch those supply lines you still have a lot of country left to organize the defense and logistics in, even if you lose 100 miles on the north and south.

Finland wouldn't use the Ukrainian strategy, because if they gave away the first 100 miles of land from the border, they wouldn't have much country left, especially if you add in artillery range. Their strategy would look completely different, likely so different that it's hard to analogize to the current war.",7c22a3b286992e9f0e28407280552c014073b6b5,True,False,,,,,0,1652650035,,0,{},i8qrhmi,False,t3_uq4l37,False,True,t1_i8qo684,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8qrhmi/,1652650052,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652621235.0

&gt;The last paragraph is a bit no shit Sherlock, you know exactly what I meant. 

My point was that the Baltics' history make them a more preferable target for revanchism. Azerbaijan was a territorial acquisition from the Russo-Persians wars. The Baltics, on the other hand, have a long political and cultural history intertwined with both Russia and central Europe.

IMO there are a couple similarities between China-Hong Kong and Russia-Baltic countries. The Baltics were one of the more developed and educated regions of the USSR and the Russian Empire before it. I remember reading an interesting Russian viewpoint that the Baltics are viewed as having selfishly broken away from the Russian sphere of influence, taking with them the wealth and human capital they rightfully owed Russia.

Russia already has massive amounts of resources. It's not invading Azerbaijan for a handful more. Strategic and sociopolitical concerns will take precedence over resources when it comes to picking targets for the Putin regime's revanchism.

Oh, and on a final note, the Baltics also have ethnic Russian minorities whereas Azerbaijan does not.

Attacks do quickly lose effectiveness once they're revealed, and are also very likely to be copied, reverse engineered, and disseminated - so they're often hoarded rather than used. Similarly any access you have will be allowing you to gather information, and if you use it to do damage you'll probably lose that access.

But of course, potentially and if you chose to, you could probably make a mess of certain parts of certain services like electricity. But you're already in a hot war and dropping a bomb on something will make a far bigger mess.

Then why aren't these video's apparing on Ukranian mothers facebook pages ? Or their twitter accounts ? Or in their discussions ?

Why do they invariably turn up on a Pro-Ru account that otherwise just releases Ru media stories and Ru govt press releases ?

Why do they never link to the ""original Ukranians mothers twitter account I got this video"" ?

Likely because they got the video not from any Ukranians.....but from their usual sources, an Ru media/Ru govt account sent them the footage.

&gt;So, are you saying that all three videos of street protests in Lviv and Zakarpattia were fake, because ""there is no original source"" (what does it mean anyway?).

I am saying..... Ru media is disseminating all thee videos. These are not ""Accounts finding this on Ukranians twitter""..... These are ""accounts being forwarded the videos by the Ru media/Ru govt"".

Where *they* get them from....no-one knows. In some cases (the desrtion videos) they could be faked, could be done with captured prisoners, could be done a bucnh of ways..... In other cases, they could be genuine footage. Of protests organised specifically to be video's and released.

What is striking is that they are presented as ""what the ukranians are saying/doing"".... but in no cases with any original ukranian source linked to.... and always from accounts being fed by Ru media/govt sources.

Clearly, the Ru media/govt aren't telling the Ru accounts they give the material to where they are getting them from.

&gt;Are there yesterday's two videos of separatist pro-Russians protesting against their own mobilisation also fake because ""there is no original source""?

I don't know.

Where were the videos originally posted ?

On the pro-russian persons own twitter/facebook account with a comment ""Here is footage of me protesting today"" .... and with the person in the video and the long-term account holder clearly being the same person ? Ideally with a posting history on that same account of them being a fairly normal pro-russian person up to that point ? Something like that ?

Or did they just appear on a pro-Ru media account that posts only Ru media/govt sources, has no relation/connection to the people in the video, and never says where the original video originated it just ""sprang out of the air"" and they posted it ?",c820d72cd1a75a921b60cd04ccdfc8773993b1de,True,False,,,,,0,1652648162,,0,{},i8qn7i7,False,t3_uq4l37,False,True,t1_i8ql8u0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8qn7i7/,1652648178,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652619362.0

[],False,,FirstDictonary,,,[],,,,text,t2_3si6s2gw,False,False,"Switzerland’s neutrality is a foreign policy that has worked so far. And besides, Switzerland has little reason to join NATO. There is the importance of Swiss banks where in 2018 they possessed $6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of global cross-border assets. It is imperative for the Swiss to provide stability and security for these assets, lest the Swiss lose the trust of foreign nations. 

In addition, an attack on Switzerland would be far from a walk in the park. Switzerland’s terrain is chock full of mountainous terrain and chokepoints. Combine that with a modern military and you get a situation where invading Switzerland is a waste of resources.

So it is in Switzerland’s interests to remain neutral nor is there a pressing need to join NATO. Finland is joining NATO because they share a land border with Russia and it was clear that economic integration and neutrality wasn’t going to prevent war as Ukraine proved. Sweden, well, there’s a reason why their decisions tend to trail behind the Finnish. If Finland joins, Sweden might as well join. Sweden’s reluctance to join NATO comes from Finland. If Sweden joined NATO without Finland, then Russia might decide to ensure that further nations don’t fall into NATO’s hands. In addition, Swedish neutrality isn’t a new concept. 

By comparison, Switzerland has no immediate threat. 

As for Austria, the idea of neutrality stuck. Austria isn’t threatened by its neighbors. So Austria has little reason to join. However, Austria’s active participation in the European Union’s defense policies muddy the waters here.

For Ireland, their military isn’t exactly stunning and they have a defense agreement with the United Kingdom. In theory, the closest threat would be Russian submarines crossing the GIUK gap. So Ireland may not be able to bring much military wise but base-wise, Ireland can certainly provide some airports for NATO ASW patrols to operate out of in addition to the ones based out of the UK and Iceland. And of course, it helps that Ireland does participate in some peacekeeping operations and that Russia hasn’t left Ireland alone with Russian criminals performing cyberattack on medical infrastructure in 2021 and a Russian navy exercise off Ireland’s coastline. So Ireland can join NATO, its a question whether its people want to.

Also, to address something, to say that a country can’t join NATO because its military is too small should probably look at Exhibit A of why that isn’t necessarily the case: Iceland. Iceland has no standing army—only having a coast guard and an air defense system without SAMs—and the only NATO member to not have one. The closest thing Iceland has to an army is its Icelandic Crisis Response Unit. There are 250 in the reserves and 250 paramilitary so that is 500 in total. That is less than half of Luxembourg’s military which has 1,010 troops in total.  However, Iceland is at the GIUK gap, that being the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap comprising of the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland and the portion of the Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and the UK. During the Cold War, it was feared that Soviet submarines would be able to use this gap to access the Atlantic and wreak havoc, whether be on convoys or the eastern seaboard. So Iceland proved to be a strategically important location to prevent this from occurring. Another example would be Luxembourg, one of NATO’s founding members. The reasons behind this are actually quite simple: they learned the hard way through two invasions and occupations in the span of 30 years that neutrality and isolationism doesn’t prevent war. In addition, they saw America as liberators of sorts, the Second World War still fresh in their minds. And then Portugal. Portugal’s islands provided the Allies during the Second World War with valuable airstrips to counter German U-boat operations in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and they sought to continue their use. Portugal dictated some terms and required that the use of the islands required Portugal’s approval. In addition, it would increase Portugal’s prestige at home and abroad and provide stability and security for Portugal. For Albania, it is also relatively simple. Support from the United States was the reason why the opposition party won post-communist Albania so the Albanian government followed up with pro-Western policies. In addition, Albania has viewed the United States rather favorably since the First World War so joining NATO is a no brainer.

For Malta, their neutrality is a result of the Cold War and it has stuck around. So far, their approach towards defense is limited by EU defense policies and the Maltese Constitution. A survey taken shortly before the war in Ukraine stated that 63% of the population desired to remain neutral and a paltry 6% wanted to break said neutrality. 

Another country would be Cyprus but they would have little chance of joining NATO as it would be almost guaranteed that Turkey will oppose this and some Cypriots see NATO as the reason why Cyprus is divided in half as Turkey was and still is a member of NATO. Not like it matters since the British have bases on Cyprus due to the partition. 

In short, the countries that haven’t joined NATO yet are countries that benefit from neutrality like Switzerland, countries that became neutral due to the Cold War like Malta and Austria, have defensive ties to the United Kingdom like Ireland, or are literally incapable of joining NATO like Cyprus. Smaller countries that joined NATO tend to either have strategic locations like Iceland, realized that neutrality doesn’t work like Luxembourg, or are indebted to the United States in someway like Luxembourg and Albania. And for Portugal, it was due to the importance of their islands to the security of the Atlantic and the domestic and international political benefits it would bring to Portugal.

It's also bordered by two allied countries, one of which shares a direct border with Russia too.

True, but it's thin. The long end of Finland is facing Russia, while the short end of Ukraine is facing Russia. I'm not saying it would be a pushover, but it would be a totally different war. That might be workable given the more favorable terrain for defense, but it makes it difficult to make predictions in my opinion.

I've just spent some time looking into the videos posted by pro-Ru channels showing TD units deserting and/or refusing to fight. What I am able to see on twitter and other sources appears to point ot a co-ordinated propoganda campaign on this front that kicked off on May 9th.

There are a few different items, that all surfaced in the same way...

* On a pro-Ru twitter account that previously posted Ru Media and/or Ru-Govt releases
* Between 30th April- May 9th
* With no indication of the source the Ru account received the information from
* Generally starting with claims mothers/wives are protesting their units being sent to the front
* Generally following up with information that purports to show that TD units are being sent to the front, without adequate training or equipments, and are deserting/refusing to fight as a result.
* Always, without exception, not giving any link to the original source of the claim/screeenshot/video. Just posting it with comment.

So far these appear to cover at least 3 TD units, none of which I can find any indications were ever sent to the front.

**103rd Lviv TD/Anti-mobilisation protests in Lviv**

Here it is a simple claim on 10th May, by an account that regularly posts Ru fed content (Ru press releases, Ru media, Ru govt. briefings etc) that

https://twitter.com/ILRUSSO1/status/1523882561239494658
&gt;Recall that today was also a protest action organized by relatives of militants from the 103rd Troop Brigade from the Lvov region 

No information elsewhere exists concerning this protest. Ru sources may claim this is due to a UA media blackout on it, but in that case....how did an Ru account know *on the same day* that a protest had taken place ? 

This was followed up a few days later by claims of mass protests in lvov against mobilisation.... again by pro-Ru accounts....again with no sourcing and using what looks (to my untrained eye) like a photoshopped photo in support of that

https://twitter.com/Russia9May45/status/1524908713953443840
&gt;Mass protests against mobilization took place in the Lvov region

&gt;Ukrainian women took to mass anti-war rallies, demanding that the government of Ukraine stop mobilization in the country.

As yet this one hasn't been followed up by a ""desertion video"".

**115th Brigade**

This one follows a similar format. Claims that surface on 9th May, only on pro-Ru accounts that typically post material produced by Ru media/government. 

Again on May 9th, screenshotted account of a ""wife"" saying 115th brigade is being wiped out on the front, they're surounded and will be destroyed

https://twitter.com/Navsteva/status/1524087598553214978
&gt;A snapshot of Ukraine's defeat: The wife of a Ukrainian soldier from the 115th Brigade, who is almost encircled in Severodonetsk, pleads with Zelensky.

This is followed up with todays video, first seen around 15th of May of men claiming to be a part of the 115th refusing to fight.

Again, as with all these links, posted by pro-Ru accounts who usually only post Ru media/Ru govt. links and with no sourcing as to where they obtained the video. Easliest example on twitter...

https://twitter.com/Levi_godman/status/1525779335717822464
&gt;Another appeal of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The 115th brigade is in touch.

&gt;Brief retelling:

&gt;There is no way to follow orders. The evil enemy, with the help of irresistible force, drove us out of the positions we occupied from April 19 to May 3.

This time claiming that the 115th territorial brigade had been posted to the front and had deserted/refused to fight.

This is immediately picked up and amplified about 10 similar pro-Ru accounts who effectively spread it around, often using the same text on their tweets.

As far as I can make out from any other sources.....115th remains in Zhytomyr, there is nothing I can find other than these claims (all coming from Pro-Ru accounts and without links to original sources) that they've been posted to Sverodonetsk or the front more generally.

**101st Territorial Brigade**

You're never going to guess what ? 

On April 30th a bunch of Pro-Ru accounts who previously post mainly Ru media/Ru government videos, start posting about a protest in Khurt of supposedly relatives/mothers of 101st territorial trying to prevent their TD unit being sent to the front. As always, there is no original source to the videos

https://twitter.com/Vas7Alexander/status/1520464668191780864
&gt;The wives of the fighters of the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade are protesting in front of ""military registration and enlistment office"" in the city of Khust (Hungarian border).
Their husbands being sent to the frontline
The Ukrainian government is acutely short of manpower.

Then just as with the 115th above, this is later followed up by a video purporting to be the unit protesting/refusing to fight/deserting.... which, once again, first comes from Pro-Ru accounts that previously posted Ru Media/Ru govt. sources and who post this video giving no original source from where they got it from. The very first guy to post it....is the exact SAME guy who was the first to post the 115th video to twitter too....

https://twitter.com/Levi_godman/status/1523781333528739840
&gt;Territorial defense fighters complain about being sent to the front

&gt;Militants of the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade (TrO) from the Transcarpathian region complain that they were sent to the front line in the LPR.

As with all the above....no original sourcing..... immediately spread far and wide by about a dozen other Pro-Ru accounts.

Only other references to the 101st I can find online are....Pro-Ru sources claiming this unit lost 600 men in popansa.... and (further back) video's of them training late in April (including a video of them being issued a Maxim gun that was spread around quite a lot by the same Pro-Ru accounts).

It is unclear where the 101st Lviv TD brigade is, however. They may still be Lviv, they may be in Donbas somewhere, we just have no indication of them being on the front the same way we have for other TD brigades there (all from the Oblast they are fighting on the front within).

So....... Where are the Pro-Ru accounts getting all these videos/screenshots from ?

No-one knows, they never say. 

They just, seemingly, appear..... and not just ""appear anywhere"".... appear exclusively to Pro-Ru accounts that seem to previously post almost exclusively ru media and ru govt releases. When the videos go to a link, off twitter, they go to Youtube/Rumble/Odysee accounts where the rest of their content is Ru media/Ru govt.

I don't think is conclusive, but it does appear to me that there is a high liklihhod that there is an attempting propoganda campaign ongoing with at least two aims

1) To lower morale of UA citizens with relatives in TD Brigades and/or TD personnel and convince them to desert and/or refuse to fight.

2) To raise morale of Ru supporters, by showing the UA army ""resorting to"" untrained/ill-equipped forces on the front line .... and further to show those units as deserting and being of low morale.",2a05ba3ffac9fae78dca2dfbf17ca3bc9b809de6,True,False,,,,,0,1652645416,,0,{},i8qgw0k,False,t3_uq4l37,False,True,t3_uq4l37,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8qgw0k/,1652645432,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652616616.0

Cyber warfare isn't bullshit in the sense that it's entirely possible to scope out network vulnerabilities and hold on to zero-days for years in preparation for a major attack. It is bullshit in the sense that cyber ""warfare"" is more like a nuclear decapitating strike than an ongoing conflict. However, after that strike the systems can still possibly be re-imaged and brought back up in some capacity. That strike will also have just revealed all the vulnerabilities to their engineers to patch, as you've already noted.

Russia's infrastructure is actually difficult to ""hack"" simply because it's all so old that either the computer architecture predates modern libraries, there is little to no connectivity to the wider internet, or it's simply analog. I wouldn't be surprised if Ukraine were similar.

What I'm getting is that cyber attacks against Ukraine on any noticeable scale probably aren't possible simply because the infrastructure is not modern (I'm talking about the computers and systems supporting public Ukrainian infrastructure, not Ukrainian software companies which are modern). This leaves NATO countries as the only remaining target of a coordinated large scale cyber attack. However, not only is there little reason to launch a massive cyber attack on NATO countries for this war, but the Russians were explicitly counting on NATO countries *not* to get involved.

All-in-all, I don't think this conflict took place under the right circumstances to warrant a true cyber-attack.

I think those yacht/property seizures are mainly punitive/symbolic really but at least they are targeted and do not affect the general public.

&gt;Well the point is are those byproducts necessary? Are they counterproductive? Those are discussions that need to be had, even if the answer ends up being 'yes'.

&gt;The intent is ostensibly fine, but sanctions have a broad range of real world effects and unforeseeen consequences. They need to be assessed holistically, not solely based on a particular focus.

Yes we can definitely discuss them but don't think that the people responsible for them haven't thought them through/assessed the consequences.

&gt;It also just quite possibly doesn't really work, other than to enforce a 'virtue tax' on the west. I'd argue that it may in fact be one of the more useless sanctions despite being the one everyone's clamouring for.

Where the TD forces are on the frontline, there are tweets and actions shots etc etc. But these appear only to be local TD forces.

This video is looking highly suspicious, given the complete lack of any other information at all that this unit is anywhere near the front line, or any other TD unit outside its oblast.

It seems to be a new line in Kremlin propoganda they are developing, as I'm seeing it from russian accounts a lot ""They are throwing TDs from western oblasts into the line as cannon fodder"".

Portugal joined in 1949, at a time where Ireland joining would be unthinkable for many reasons.  Portugal still fancied themselves a naval power (I doubt the Irish fleet is or ever was much, and they don't have overseas properties) at the time and Britain invited them to engage in further naval coordination with them and the US, as part of a broad alliance.

While Portugal remained neutral in WW2, there were a lot of allied sympathies there so joining NATO seemed like a way to catch up with the pack.

Spain also had concerns about future aggression, which is why it was in military alignment with NATO since 1953.  However, it did not enter formal membership until 1982 due to a combination of popular opinion and Franco in particular being unwelcome in the full alliance.

At present, any new NATO member would only join if they wanted to assert themselves as a regional military power (lol), or if they were afraid of Russian aggression (lol).  They'd also need popular opinion, which who knows how Irish people feel about that.

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"&gt; * Thus, U.S. market dominance in power projection, exemplified in the new American way of war described earlier, could be disrupted via the technology of the ballistic missile and a business model (strategy) that emphasized preemptive strikes against adversary bases.110 

&gt; * What makes ballistic missiles so disruptive to the American way of war? When tied to advanced sensors and a robust command and control system, mobile ballistic missiles offer some of the benefits of a first-class air force to nations whose air forces are weak or developing. Just as the USAF’s ability to initiate military campaigns by penetrating defenses and delivering precision munitions against a wide range of targets has proven to be devastating to adversary conventional military forces, so might a quality mobile ballistic-missile force create similar effects, particularly if used preemptively. Although ballistic missiles are more costly than aircraft to deliver larger numbers of weapons during a prolonged conflict, they could be decisive in a short war under some conditions. Specifically, ballistic-missile attacks on air bases and aircraft carriers have the potential to destroy many aircraft and heavily damage runways and aircraft carriers,111 disrupting sortie generation so severely that an adversary might achieve its military and political objectives before the United States could effectively intervene.112 This would present the United States with a fait accompli to either accept or attempt to reverse at potentially great cost. 

&gt; * Finally, missile mobility is a key attribute of these systems because, instead of presenting fixed targets at known locations (that can be attacked with standoff weapons), mobile missiles present an extraordinary search problem for the United States, requiring persistent high-resolution surveillance of a vast area and either rapid strike or the ability to track targets for hours while subsonic attack systems transit to the target location.114 

&gt; * On the metrics that mattered to airmen,115 not to mention programmers, planners, and strategists, ballistic missiles underperformed. The cost per target destroyed was much greater, accuracy much lower, payload per mission lower, range fixed (and too short), and force deployability and flexibility poor. That slowly changed between 1999 and 2008, as a growing body of research, analysis, and war-gaming built a new consensus within the defense community that Chinese ballistic missiles represented a growing threat to U.S. power-projection capabilities and that counters would be necessary. 

&gt; * Late in the war (WWI), the Germans were so disturbed by a successful attack on Boulay aerodrome (which destroyed five aircraft and damaged another ten) that they built a dummy airfield nearby. The decoy airfield succeeded, diverting subsequent British attacks from the real airfield.127 

&gt; * In the late 1980s, the USAF developed inflatable decoy aircraft like the F-16 shown in Figure 5.2, but the Cold War ended before they were procured in numbers. Similar decoys are manufactured for various U.S. and Russian designs, but they do not appear to be in common use by major air forces. 

&gt; * A multiyear RAND analysis of Google Earth imagery of more than 700 airfields found hardened aircraft shelters in 70 countries, in every region of the world. 

&gt; * As the level of aircraft protection increases, at some point, aircraft are no longer an attractive target relative to other options. Aircraft in the open are clearly a high-leverage target. However, as the resources necessary to damage or destroy them in shelters increase, other targets, such as operating surfaces and fuel, become more attractive. Depending on the attacker’s objectives, expected length of the conflict, and other considerations, closing air bases during critical phases of a conflict might be more important than destroying aircraft. For these reasons, the preferred mix and degree of hardening, postattack recovery, dispersal, and other air base defense measures can be determined only through modeling and simulation, particularly techniques that, like game theory, can account for the complexities and dynamics of opposed and adaptive strategies. 

&gt; * The Polish Air Force survived the initial, massive Luftwaffe attack against its airfields on September 1, 1939, because, in the 48 hours prior to the attack, all aircraft had been dispersed to emergency airfields. 

&gt; * “In a conflict where air bases played a central role, the ability to construct and develop them was critical. Japan’s rudimentary military construction capability proved a serious burden and crippled its forces during Guadalcanal. In contrast, the United States and its Allies showed an impressive ability to organize major construction projects both quickly and efficiently. Although no one guessed it at the time . . . the ability of the U.S. Command to change its priorities overnight and implement a major base construction plan in an area where no one had previously thought to fight eventually brought Japan’s position in the South Pacific to ruin.”

&gt; * As U.S. defense planners look to future challenges in which anti-access threats are likely to be more common, they will need to develop a new portfolio of capabilities that includes concepts for more-dispersed and resilient operations; programs of record (e.g., for mobile command posts and communication, additional security forces, expanded logistics support, aircraft decoys, hardened shelters, and fuel-storage bladders); investment plans (e.g., to help partner nations improve dispersal-site infrastructure); organizational and manning changes (e.g., to allow USAF squadrons to operate from more-austere dispersed locations rather than MOBs); and, finally, a more integrated joint force approach to protecting forward locations. 

&gt; * Highly accurate long-range strike systems, particularly ballistic and cruise missiles, make it much harder to have useful rear-area sanctuaries because these missiles are extremely difficult to defend against and can reach those locations to which U.S. forces would prefer to deploy or from which they would prefer to operate.

The advancement of accuracy of ballistic missiles is a great section to read if you want to skip to that one, there is a helpful illustration in that section on hitting aircraft on the ground that cannot be quoted. This issue is shaping the strategic balance in Asia right now and it seems that it will continue to do so for the next few decades. 

The amount of aircraft that have been hit on the ground is fascinating as we often only think of kills in the air. But striking airbases and aircraft before they get a chance to get off the ground is a tactic that is as old as airpower and much more efficient.

-----------------

&gt; * Air base attacks have been a common feature of both minor and major conflicts in the past century. 

&gt; * In World War II alone, Axis air forces lost more than 18,000 aircraft destroyed *on the ground* by U.S. Army Air Force, Navy, and Marine air attacks. 

&gt; * ...the U.S. Air Force (USAF) lost roughly 1,600 aircraft damaged or destroyed on the ground by Vietcong or North Vietnamese rocket or mortar attacks on U.S. bases in South Vietnam. 

&gt; * The major components of air base defense first identified in World War I (active defense; camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD); hardening; dispersal on and off base; and postattack recovery) reflect enduring military principles and offer a sound framework for air base defense planning today. 

&gt; * After the Cold War ended, the United States found that it could operate from rear- area sanctuaries, and from this flowed a new American way of war. 
&gt; * Emerging long-range strike capabilities are bringing the era of sanctuary to an end, with significant implications for the American way of war. 

&gt; * The United States will need to adapt its power-projection concepts to operate under a greater threat of attack. 

&gt; * Although the mix of air base defense measures will vary by theater and threat, dispersed operations are likely to become central to operational concepts against highly capable adversaries. 

&gt; * Similarly, Iraqi insurgent and Taliban mortar and rocket attacks on air bases, although quite common, did minimal damage to aircraft and failed to disrupt air operations. Even the most successful Taliban attack of the war—the September 2012 commando raid on Camp Bastion (which destroyed six Marine Corps Harriers and damaged another two)—had no impact on sortie generation or the ability of U.S. air elements to provide support to forces in the field. 

&gt; * Once ballistic missiles achieved acceptable accuracy, they had the potential to become the weapon of choice for airfield attack, particularly at the beginning of a short war and especially for attackers inclined toward preemptive strategies. 

&gt; * The United States has used cluster munitions in every conflict since World War II, delivering millions over the course of the past 70 years.59 The Chinese also possess a large and varied inventory of cluster munitions and, in their open literature, have highlighted the utility of these weapons for airfield attack.60 

&gt; * …analytical evidence that combining cluster munitions with accurate missiles greatly increased the lethality and efficiency of missile attacks on airfields. 

&gt; * If we compare the numbers of missiles required to close bases with the numbers that China is currently fielding, clearly the U.S. could face extended periods of time when few, if any, of our bases near China are operating. RAND analysis has estimated that in the near-future, even with conservative estimates of TBM production, Kadena could be kept closed to fighter operations for at least a week and kept closed to heavy aircraft . . . for much longer.67 

&gt; * The Chinese would also likely use SOF in any conflict against a technologically advanced foe. Writing in 2007, Roger Cliff and his coauthors observed, 
“In addition to missile and air strikes, Chinese sources indicate that covert operatives, such as SOF or saboteurs, would also play an important role in attacks on enemy air bases. Some writings on the general missions that are assigned to SOF units suggest their role in air base attacks would include strategic reconnaissance, harassment attacks, and direct-action missions, such as carrying out strikes on critical base facilities, destroying aircraft, and assassinating key personnel.99”

&gt; * Chinese improvements in ballistic missiles and supporting systems… have the potential to be disruptive in the military sphere… With a force of more than 1,000 high-quality TBMs, centralized in a single organization dedicated to missile operations (the 2nd Artillery Corps),106 the Chinese field an offensive conventional missile force unlike any the world has seen. This force has the potential to conduct accurate and sustained attacks against U.S. and partner-nation airfields in East Asia.",a8b1029166d1eddc24bf3166bdbfbf4f16548040,True,False,,,,,0,1652630055,,0,{},i8pht7g,True,t3_uq8r1b,False,True,t3_uq8r1b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq8r1b/air_base_attacks_and_defensive_counters/i8pht7g/,1652630071,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652601255.0

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Basically there are three causes to the division of Eastern Europe. 

1) Military control: pretty simply, the borders of the Cold War were roughly drawn by the victorious powers based on where their armies stopped moving. Where the Allied armies were would become Western Europe, thanks to the France first approach, and where the Soviets stopped became the east. Russia conquered most of Poland in 1944 during Operation Bagration, though they stalled out at Warsaw until the winter. In the west, the Falaise pocket was fought at about the same time as the height of Bagration, and by the time the Warsaw Uprising collapsed the Allie’s were just wrapping up the botched Market Garden operation.  All of it meant that the Allies had no physical access to Eastern Europe, and thus could not have an impact on what was happening there. 

2) Political: military control begot political oppression. From the period of the Warsaw Uprising until the early ‘90s Soviet troops were the enforcers for Communist governments across Eastern Europe. Step out of line, get out of hand, and the Red Army would come stomp your face. This oppression began swiftly and was designed to do one thing: eliminate any and all non-communist opposition. Stalin had promised FDR that he would not do this, and FDR accepted that tho it would have been obvious to anyone that’s what the Soviets were going to do. But he really couldn’t do anything because of the military control, and himself thought he could influence Stalin through their close personal relationship. When FDR died, however, Stalin felt he had an opportunity to remake the deals he had made with FDR. Truman felt he had to be tough on the Russian Bully. And so you have that inbuilt tension which limited even further western influence in Easter Europe. 

3) Spheres of Influence: the UN world system was built on the idea of world cops managing their spheres to limit the chances of a future world war. Each country on the security council would have a sphere and, in essence, be a recognized great power. The system was created from day 1 to give the Soviets disproportionate control over Eastern Europe. Probably it’s the case that had they not, they would have never signed on to the UN system in the first place. After having fought so hard with the old League of Nations, the USSR was inherently distrustful of the whole idea. Of course this only further sold out Eastern Europe to Russian depredation. 

Given the context of the end of the war, the Allies did not have the will or resources to fundamentally challenge Russias military control over the region, which underwrote the rest of the project. And they’d given up political influence for a variety of reasons. And so there was little they could do to stop Stalin from doing what he wanted. But i would also say that Stalin’s treatment of Eastern Europe played a major role in the onset of the Cold War. Many westerners had the exact negative reaction you’re wondering about, and it led to them supporting measures to check Soviet expansion into even *more* areas. So not without effect, the whole project of containment was based on the failure to secure Eastern Europe after WWII.",3f582df481ad37874417c06d040563749f4d4f27,True,False,,,,,0,1652621854,,0,{},i8p07x1,False,t3_upfrh6,False,True,t1_i8nchk7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8p07x1/,1652621866,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652593054.0

[],False,,sanderudam,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iure,False,False,"So let us say you are in charge of planning and executing mobilization in Ukraine. How would you set the process up, would you prioritize reinforcing existing units, creating new ones, how and why?

You have roughly 500 000 men that have either served compulsory service and/or served in the Donbas front during non-active / low-intensity phase. They have experience in the military hierarchy and basics, but do not have experience in a high-intensity combat.

What options do you have?

You can send reinforcements into existing units on the front taking damage. You can send them individually, or you could form new squads, or platoons, or even battalions.

You could prioritize reinforcements on units in refit (in this instance units that took part in battles of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy etc) and that now have had a bit of respite, or you could send reinforcements straight into units engaged in active battle in Donbas.

You could try and form entirely new brigades. You probably have small arms and some personal combat gear, but lack heavier equipment. Where would you take officers? Creating entirely new green units seems very risky. They would probably do alright taking over some fronts with low-intensity combat, but are probably illsuited for larger offensive actions.

Would you strip away experiences units or sub-units from the brigades on the front to gain experiences core around which to build the new brigades?

You are planning to create a strategic reserve with which to take strategic initiative by mid-summer and go on an offensive. Would you try to push these newly mobilized troops into new offensive units, or would you try and refit the old experiences brigades and use the mobilized troops for rear-area duty? Do something completely different?

How I would personally approach this:

1) As a first order of business, try and get as many men as possible under arms and start training.

2) There are surely some troops with very recent combat experience that have fought in the very same units currently on the front line taking damage. These men could be sent to reinforce those active units immediately and they would be familiar with those specific units and hope to have a relatively smooth integration (you would send them to the same squad, platoon, company they served previously if at all possible).

3) Next priority is reinforcements into active brigades in refit (those from formerly active fronts or currently static/low-intensity fronts). Troops with recent experience would go there.

4) Next step will be the construction of new brigades. This takes months of training (quick re-training of basic training, followed by squad and platoon tactics and building up accordingly). I think it might be possible to do this on a battalion-basis. I would create 3 fresh battalions from mobilized troops and consider if I could pull 1 battalion from an active brigade in low-intensity area. Insert 1 fresh battalion in the existing brigade replacing the pulled battalion. And create a new brigade around the 2 fresh battalions and the 1 experienced battalion pulled from the active brigade. This way the newly created brigade would have an experienced core and the existing brigades would not lose too much experience.

5) Create an active reserve of troops that are kept being trained and used as replacements in all the possible formations. Would probably try to keep it squad/platoon based???",e455924f651eeab9516cc1125d253cd928e2dc7a,True,False,,,,,0,1652618218,,0,{},i8otpb8,False,t3_uq4l37,False,True,t3_uq4l37,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uq4l37/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_15_2022/i8otpb8/,1652618235,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652589418.0

Arguably even German reunification had pain points and arguably still does in some parts of the former East Germany and that's harder to pin on conniving Westerners considering that most of it was managed internally by Germany, the strongest Western European economy.

I mean, Germany and Japan seem like two examples rather successful examples of nation building. There's a number of reasons why Ukraine makes an excellent candidate to nation building: 

* It's had a distinct national identity since the late 1700's.

* It has a reasonably well educated population with little internal sectarian conflict

* It has good farmland, a strong industrial base and a reasonably skilled labour force

* Prior to the invasion Ukraine was an emerging free-market economy aligning itself increasingly with Western values of liberal democracy. Since the invasion it has become *staunchly* pro-Western.

I'd say with adequate investment I'd say it's very likely to become a peaceful, productive and stable nation, assuming that Russia can be repulsed from it's territory.

&gt;Ukraine will become free and prosperous on it's own merits, or it won't.

That's a pretty absurd statement to make given the context of this thread. Without the billions of dollars of Western aid provided since 2014, Ukraine would almost certainly be anything but free right now.

&gt;And beyond that, why is it EU's concern?

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"Interesting opinion piece which says a lot more about the position the author is coming from than providing a worthwhile analysis.

For example:

&gt;What has surprised U.S. policymakers is the speed and intensity through which the U.S. and European public have demanded stronger actions. European outrage has led to a far stronger sanctions response than imagined possible be for the war. Europe has demonstrated it is willing to bear substantial economic costs to weaken Russia and is now moving at an incredible pace to decouple from Russia, now targeting Russian oil.

This is patently untrue. The anti-Russian sentiment was shipped up in a calculated manner by the US (beginning around 2012 - remember the role of Victorian Nuland?).

What the opinion piece does get right is the following:

&gt;The basic problem for Putin is that Western strategy to weaken Russia is working better than anyone could have expected. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s comment may have overstepped when he bluntly said, “We want to see Russia weakened.” But underlying Austin’s comments is a clear sense of confidence that the strategy is clearly working.

The strategy to whip up the anti-Russian sentiment may be considered to be a part of the larger political warfare waged by the US against Russia. After all, the best way to wage war is to instigate and provoke your adversary to initiate hostilities on land very far away from your own territory. This the US has done excellently and I consider this to be a strategic failure of President Putin and his circle of advisors.

The author's disingenuous argumentation is revealed in, for example, the following:

&gt;Thus, the two defining obsessions of the Putin era—regime survival and Russia’s geopolitical might—are in tension. As sanctions take their toll and battlefield losses mount, the gap between Putin’s ambitions and Russia’s capacity is likely to grow. As a leader obsessed with geopolitics, Putin will inevitably engage in a desperate scramble to maintain Russia’s great power status, but he will find it incredibly difficult in the weeks, months, and years ahead to do so.

Superficially, what the author observes appears to be true/correct. Indeed Russia is striving to express it's geopolitical might. Though the term ""geopolitical relevance"" is perhaps more appropriate in this context. But then again, presuming a realist perspective of IR, which state does not arrive to maintain its geopolitical relevance. If, as some commentators argue, we should be mindful of the ""agency"" of Ukraine, the equally we have to account for the ""agency"" of Russia (as we do for the US, for the PRC, for I dia etc.). This Russian sense of ""agency"" for a variety of historical reasons is tied into their perception and, importantly, their actions (in the historical context) with that of a ""great power"". Next is the question concerning what the author refers to as ""Putin's regime"". Notice that this formulation already delegitimizes not simply President Putin's government, but also that of Russia as a viable state, that is, a state that can have a viable government and which is not a ""basket case"".

This is the reason why talk about ""regime change"" and President Biden's recent declarations of ""Putin must go"" (or something to that effect) is indicative of how the enemy is framed by which I mean the light in which the enemy is being cast.

Further, the author asserts:

&gt;Russia’s defense industrial prowess is key to its foreign policy and undergirds its relationships with countries across the globe. This is especially true for a country like India. India is dependent on the Russian arms industry and has $8 billion worth of outstanding military orders from Russia, and also needs a continuous supply of spare parts and components. Indian officials said they expect some short-term delays in the “S-400 Triumf missile systems, Grigorovich-class stealth frigates, and Kalashnikov AK 203-7.62x39mm assault rifles, as well as spares supplies for Kilo-class submarines, MiG-29 fighters, and Kamov Mi-17 military transport helicopters. . . . India today imports over 10,000 types of spares and line replacement units worth over $500 million annually from Russia.” 

All this is true. But the author also does not mention that (1) India has leased SSNs (specifically, the Akula class) from Russia (without the weapons since.thrynhave their own), which no other country would be willing to do. And, more importantly, (2) dependency on Russia for arms and, to some extent, oil and gas and some heavy chemicals is one thing, but a larger concern is India's own strategic needs and priorities. Even if India did not have this dependency on Russia, it is unlikely India would turn it's back on Russia again for a variety of historical reasons, it's deep distrust of the West (again for historical reasons) and sheer strategic pragmatism. Notice none of this is mentioned or even acknowledged by the author. This is not surprising. One only has to look at the discussions that took place recently at the Raisina Dialogues in New Delhi to note what I refer to as the monomaniacal focus of representatives from Europe to compel India to abandon Russia. Of course, seasoned international players - the ones who know how the cards fall - like the US, the UK, France understand India's stance and have refrained from lecturing it's political and diplomatic leadership.

In sum, therefore, this article is interesting. But it is only ""an opinion"", which is probably why it was filed under the ""Commentary"" section. But then again, for an august body like the CSIS to give such ""opinions"" a platform surprises me.

Beria was taken completely by surprise. He asked, ""What's going on, Nikita Sergeyevich? Why are you picking fleas in my trousers?""

Besides those listed, a notable difference is the size dynamics at play. Russia is a bigger country than Ukraine, both in terms of size and population. Japan on the other hand was smaller than China, even taking Chinese factionalism and the entire Empire of Japan into account, in terms of size and population.

Unlike the Russians in Ukraine, the Japanese Army in China was _very_ capable of defeating the Chinese in battle, doing so on numerous occasions, even as late as Operation Ichi-Go in 1944. China's size, however, meant that there was just too much of it for Japan to really get a grasp of. Their soldiers remained committed to the fight, often fanatically so, but that wasn't enough.

Other differences include the direct presence of US forces on the ground, and the resource limitations of Japan relative to Russia. The US was directly involved in the China theatre, mostly through the presence of the Army Air Force. It doesn't seem likely that the USAF will directly set up shop in Ukraine. For Japan, the war in China was a huge drain on resources, and given Japan's dependency on foreign nations for these resources, the eventual embargo by the US, UK, and Netherlands would be an important step to Japan's declaration of war on those nations.

Catastrophic Russian losses in a failed river crossing and the military incompetence displayed in that crossing have shaken the confidence of some prominent Russian milbloggers.  
Russian forces continue shaping operations for the Battle of Severodonetsk from the south even though those losses have at least temporarily disrupted their efforts from the north.  
Ukrainian forces announced that they will conduct a counteroffensive around Izyum.  
Russian forces continued to withdraw from northern Kharkiv Oblast, but will likely seek to hold a line defending their ground lines of communication from Belgorod via Vovchansk to Izyum.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely complete their withdrawal from the vicinity of Kharkiv City but attempt to hold a line west of Vovchansk to defend their GLOCs from Belgorod to Izyum. It is unclear if they will succeed.  
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.

Mao creating the border conflict where over a hundred soldiers died simply to artificially create a tense atmosphere was enlightening. And his desire to take Hong Kong by force in 1967 due to a perceived global distraction due to the Six Day War, was a window into his thought process as well. If the war turned out to be longer then perhaps he would have done it. 

The Lin Biao affair though makes for some fascinating reading. The second in command in China made an attempt at a coup, but when the assassination attempts failed he fled the country to the Soviet Union. The plane mysteriously crashed in Mongolia killing the conspirators. Given the tense situation it seems that flying too low to avoid detection resulting in a crash was also a possibility for the crash that wasn't mentioned. Just how close China came to another civil war, this time among the different parts of the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA makes for amazing reading.

&gt; * Traveling across China to interview over fifty retired cadres and officers, he argues that the role of the military during the Cultural Revolution has been understated, its role, in reality, eclipsing even that of the Red Guards in terms of scale and duration.

&gt; * Over the years, Yu has advocated for a more candid, open approach to the historical retelling of recent history, as well as the importance of using primary documents - many of which are still in unopened archives - to get a better understanding of those turbulent years.  

&gt; * …all my conclusions originate in historical facts. If you don’t have the material [to back up your claims], don’t say anything. In situations where you don’t know, don’t jump to conclusions. This is my personal experience in research. 

&gt; * In your book the thing that surprised me most was that in June 1967 Mao had been considering military action to resolve the Hong Kong issue. 

&gt; * That was the year of the Six Day War in the Middle East. The United Arab Republic, that is Egypt and Syria, attacked Israel. While the war was going on, Mao told Sang Mukta Sang that the US’s attention was only on the Middle East and it didn’t care what was happening in other places.

&gt; * He [Mao] thought that because all of their strength was there they would not be able to focus on anything else, so even Mao Zedong was thinking about regaining Hong Kong by military means. 

&gt; * That was the situation for a few days, but as soon as the Six Day War was over Mao said to forget it

&gt; * How would you rate Mao Zedong’s performance in 1969 during the Sino-Soviet crisis?

&gt; * But Mao Zedong deliberately made use of the Zhenbao Island affair to create a tense atmosphere.

&gt; * He knew very well that an all-out war between China and the Soviet Union was never going to happen, but he needed to take advantage of the very limited border skirmishes between the two countries and make a big fuss of a small battle on Zhenbao Island.

&gt; * Putting people on edge domestically diverted away from the social problems that had occurred due to the Cultural Revolution and consolidated Mao’s own power. That’s how I’d evaluate it.

&gt; * Her father was the vice premier and the second in command of the CCP. She abandoned all her family.

&gt; * This is a serious step. It’s the equivalent of betraying her family. Why does she take this step?

&gt; * At that time both were on the side of Mao’s revolutionary line and they both exposed their fathers.

&gt; * Because Lin was the vice premier, the pilot flying the plane obeyed his orders to take off. For example, Lin Biao could have said that he was performing a special mission. It could be that to start off with the pilot believed Lin, but afterwards he started having doubts and because of this deliberately sabotaged the emergency landing. This is my own inference. It’s not necessarily correct.

&gt; * These days a lot of blame is poured on Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. Many of the bad things Mao and Zhou did were blamed on them.

The total western assistance thus far have probably managed to equip a little more than a handful mechanized brigades with heavy weapons. If the Ukrainians are expecting the West to equip dozens more within a month, I believe they’ll be sorely disappointed. Even without any political red tape, moving the equipment into Ukraine, training the soldiers, then deploying them to the front will take more than a month.

It's May 14th and I'm going to say the writing is on the wall here. Russia's force is probably somewhere around 150k right now, if I am eyeballing this correctly. Already we know the UA can make good use of light infantry tactics to make life hell on the occupying force. With Lend-Lease passed, the UA will absolutely get the heavy weapons they are asking for. Even if the Russians manage to encircle Severodonestk momentarily, the chance they can take the city before the UA reaches peak combat power is low. At some point the UA is going to counterattack and the Russian Army is going to face the same situation they faced during the retreat from Kyiv. 

I just don't see how anyone can believe Russia will win this war. Putin clearly wants to avoid mobilization but his forces are going to be outmatched in fairly short order. It will be bloody, but there is currently nothing on the field of play incentivizing Zelenskyy to make a peace deal instead of driving Russia out of Ukraine proper.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-61311026

&gt; * The decades-long spy conflict between Russia and the West is intensifying over the Ukraine war. But what are Russia's intelligence services suspected of doing and how will their officials' expulsion from capitals affect Putin's clandestine overseas operations?

&gt; * But in recent months the spy war has intensified as Western countries have sought to hit back and inflict lasting damage on the ability of Russian intelligence to carry out covert operations. This is symbolised by the unprecedented expulsion of 500 Russian officials from Western capitals.

&gt; * Since 2014, Western intelligence agencies have been working to identify Russian spies involved in such activities. One of those is GRU Unit 29155 of Russian military intelligence, which is believed to be tasked with sabotage, subversion and assassination.

&gt; * It took nearly seven years to find out the unit were behind a huge explosion that tore apart an ammunition depot in a Czech forest in October 2014. They included some of those later involved in the UK's Salisbury poisonings of 2018.

&gt; * The same team also tried to poison an arms dealer in Bulgaria who had stored weapons in the Czech depot - one theory was that the blast and poisoning was linked to his supply of weapons for Ukraine where the conflict had just begun.

&gt; * While Western spies in Russia have long been subject to round-the-clock surveillance, their Russian counterparts in Western capitals have not.

&gt; * Western officials say the recent expulsions are more than a symbolic gesture of protest but part of the wider push to degrade Russia's capacity to do harm. Some spy-catchers also say the mass expulsion is long overdue. The Russians have been laughing at us for our tolerance of their presence, says one official.

&gt; * Berlin expelled 40 Russians. However, a Western intelligence official said they believed Germany had previously housed closer to 100 Russian intelligence officers, acting like an ""aircraft carrier"" for their operations.

&gt; * Security officials say they believe the volume of expulsions over a short period will have a ""debilitating"" impact on Russian intelligence as it scrambles to work out how operations can be continued and who can be placed where.

&gt; * One of the complaints from Western security services has long been the imbalance in the number of Russian diplomats in Western countries, and the proportion who are spies compared to those from the West serving in Moscow.

-----------------

&gt; * According to former CIA officer Robert Baer, author of the forthcoming The Fourth Man: The Hunt for a KGB Spy at the Top of the CIA and the Rise of Putin's Russia, the CIA and the U.S. intelligence community are in a similar liminal period. Since the mid-1980s, there have been lingering suspicions that Moscow had a major spy within the CIA, a spy who is yet to be caught.

&gt; * Baer refers to this person as “the Fourth Man,” counting the CIA’s Edward Lee Howard and Aldrich Ames and the FBI’s Robert Hanssen as the first three traitors. He tells us that since the mid-1990s there has been a candidate for the Fourth Man, a prominent figure in the CIA, but that nothing can be pinned definitively on this officer who is now retired but still alive.

&gt; * In addition, it’s often unclear throughout this book what Baer’s source is for any given claim.  This, of course, is unsurprising. Baer is, of necessity, depending primarily on former colleagues who are to varying degrees speaking out of school. Indeed, it is a bit of a wonder that the CIA cleared this book for publication, as a great many authors who have served in the agency—the present reviewer included—have had the publications review board demand redaction of far more mundane information than appears throughout this book. One wonders about the backstory here. 

&gt; * In bare outline, the story is this: Sometime apparently in the late 1980s, a Russian intelligence officer named Alexander Zaporozhsky, nicknamed Max, whom the CIA had recruited in an East African country, told his case officer that the Russians had two penetrations of U.S. intelligence, one in the CIA and one in the FBI.  The former would turn out to be Aldrich Ames, and the latter, Robert Hanssen. Max was subsequently able to provide ironclad evidence pointing to Ames, so when, in 1994, Max added that there was actually a second penetration of the CIA, his claim was taken extremely seriously.  In fact, a small cadre of mole hunters had already concluded that some of the CIA’s losses in Russia could not be attributed to Ames, Hanssen or Howard. 

&gt; * So in June 1994, Ted Price, the head of the DO, created a  discreet Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to identify this alleged spy. 

&gt; * The SIU started compiling a matrix of “anomalies” that might be relevant going back to the early 1980s.  These were various glitches, failures, or coincidences primarily in CIA operations against the Soviets and Russians but also in a few British and French cases.  In addition, there were strange, ominous, or unexplained behaviors by the Soviets and Russians. For instance, Milburn was able to provide information on dates of “starbursts,” occasions on which the Soviet or Russian residency in Washington had suddenly flooded the capital’s streets with operatives. This tactic, the bureau believed, was used to overwhelm FBI agents watching the embassy so that one Russian intelligence officer would have a strong chance of slipping FBI surveillance and conducting an important operational act.

&gt; * By putting all these anomalies into a matrix and cross-checking them against lists of CIA officers read into particular operations, travel records of CIA officers, etc., the SIU was able in November 1994 to home in on one particular suspect.  In a remarkable scene, Baer describes how the SIU held a briefing for **[the counterintelligence chief]** and a few other luminaries, in which they revealed that the CIA officer most likely to be the Fourth Man was… **[the counterintelligence chief himself]**.

&gt; * Baer describes how **[the counterintelligence chief]** retaliated against the SIU, forcing its CIA members to flee to CE Division where Bannerman ultimately came to work for Baer.  The refugees continued their work as best they could but accomplished little more. 

&gt; * Eventually, the members of the SIU, as well as **[the counterintelligence chief]** himself, retired.  Then, in 2006, the FBI started investigating  **[the counterintelligence chief]**, contacting various retired CIA officers (shades of George Smiley) to ask them about an allegation that had emerged about **[the counterintelligence chief]** —that he had made an unauthorized and highly unorthodox solo trip to Moscow in the mid-1980s.  

&gt; * Indeed, it looks suspiciously like a fallacious “perception of centralized direction,” a cognitive trap that intelligence analysts are taught to avoid but that conspiracy theorists embrace with gusto. 

&gt; * Unsurprisingly, as a result of this kind of thinking, many injustices have been done and many people have been plausibly, but falsely, accused of espionage.

Full thread is [here](https://twitter.com/PhillipsPOBrien/status/1525370885464547329)

Summary is....

* Ru appear to have lost at least 12 tanks and 50 APCs in one big engagement (Bilhorivka crossing) on or around 10th May.
* It was several days between this happenning, and the losses being reported by OSINT twitter, as it took several days for the images to come out and be properly counted
* However, Ukranian reported casualties show a big spike in tank (approx 12-20 over baseline) and APC losses reported (approx 30-40 over average) before this became known, over 10th-11th May when plausibly the UA command could have received accurate reports of the action.
* Importantly, there is not a lot of artillery lost in this crossing as measured by OSINT, and Ukranian reported artillery losses do NOT show a spike on the appropriate days indicating that UA were not just giving bigger numbers across the board but specifically ONLY in the categories were we now know Ru took particularly heavy losses
* The upshot of the above... is that it appears UA reports are at least attempting to accurately report what the forces on the ground report to the UA command chain concerning confirmed losses and aren't just ""Yeah, just say we got 10 tanks today to keep morale high whatever the figures are.... maybe say 15 tomorrow"".

Basically, its at least modest proof that UA reported Ru losses seem to be constrained by/fed from battlefield reports. 

They may still be too high, because its an observed reality that on-the-ground reports do often overstate enemy losses for a variety of reasons, but it seems that the figures we get do at least reflect to some extent what ""the UA soldiers are reporting up to the UA command concerning actions/losses on any given day"".",963286bd54061b0c94136199839c34e85c82e0e0,True,False,,,,,0,1652575361,,0,{},i8n32qd,False,t3_upfrh6,False,True,t3_upfrh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8n32qd/,1652575377,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652546561.0
