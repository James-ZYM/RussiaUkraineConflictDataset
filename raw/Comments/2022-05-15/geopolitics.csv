I am going to open with the final statement the article makes though because I actually cried tears laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;Russia is practising a warfare that the West is not used to — where wars aren’t won anymore

So the author sums up by claiming Russia never really WANTED to win the war, it wants be losing and stuck in an awful quagmire losing 1000s of visually confirmed pieces of equipment, 10,000s of men. The sheer level of delusion from these Russian Shill articles makes we wonder about the intelligence of the people that believe this stuff.

\&gt;&gt;Paradigms, to be relevant, must accurately reflect the reality. When that is no longer possible, the paradigms must be replaced, or the leaderships that rely upon them will inevitably fail. Politicians like Biden and Johnson are used to thinking in terms of a Westphalian world, and are taking time to come to terms with anomalies in the existing paradigm when new **POWERFUL** trends are dramatically altering the concept of war.   
This is not, and has never been about a rising Russia. This is a desperate Russia. With an aging population, dreadful national indicators and GDP. It has lashed out as it has lost its influence over basically its entire sphere. Its model is out dated and broken. This is Russia's Suez canal, the death of its imperialism. If Russia was not nuclear armed, the conflict would be causing nobody head aches. 

I was going to write a whole thing rebutting the rest of the article, but then realised its pointless, the author is a fool, and anyone who thinks its anything more than a shill piece needs educating

&gt; Holmèr then turned his attention to members of the Marxist-Leninist
Kurdish Worker’s Party (PKK) in Sweden, a small and violent
organization of Kurdish refugees agitating for an independent homeland
in eastern Turkey. In 1983, Palme’s government had denied an entry
visa to the party’s leader who was living in Damascus, Syria. Soon
after, two former PKK members were murdered in Sweden. Two PKK
stalwarts were subsequently convicted for the homicides. That, as well
as the Palme government’s designation of the group as a terrorist
organization in 1983, may have provided a motive for the prime

a series of dawn raids, Swedish police rounded up 20 men—most of them

I recently have watched a number of youtube lectures by Zeihan and am also wondering about his ideological bias and accuracy of his worldview and predictions.  If you are going to comment on this thread and have not read his books, you should really watch a youtube video of him talking about this.  Budget about an hour and fifteen minutes.  I would say he does cite demographics affecting most countries, but China has many very negative effects additional to demographics that may cause their downfall.  I would say so much so that replying to this based solely around the effect of demographics alone makes such a response almost irrelevant.  If you have exrensive relevant knowledge from elsewhere, I suggest you include that as you make your case.

Most respondents to this question, now a year ago, have ignored the other factors Zeihan states will harm China in the long term.  Here is what I can recall off the top with my rather poor memory.  If it sounds like my POV it is not. If you disagree it is with him, not me.  I am no expert in this area.  I am bound to have misunderstood or misremembered some things, so apologies to Zeihan and all of you for any of that.  This is accurate to the best of my abilities. 

He says that:

China has accumulated massive debt during this rapid industrialization process, and the capital has not been wisely invested.  It has been used to massively overbuild infrastructure, housing, and other development, to the extent of currently having sufficient empty housing to accommodate the next couple of decades of population growth.  This will remain vacant and suffer from disuse.  Access to capital is determined by state banks and is mostly given to a handful of favored corporations which are poorly managed, while the rest of private industry, including the most innovative companies and individuals are cash starved.  Their large foreign cash reserves and holdings stand surety to this massive debt, so it cannot be applied to remedy this upside down situation.

So he likens the coming time for China to the recession Japan faced for a couple of decades starting in the 90’s when Japan’s sort of capital house of cards tumbled down.  As Japan recovered, they have reduced corruption and invested more effectively in building automation, and they do not have a massive mountain of debt to pay off.  So Japan’s demographics are bad, but the rest of their setup is much better than China’s.  Also, Japan has easy access to the Pacific, unlike China.  Japan is on good terms with western nations, their military support and markets.  China’s terms with these is tenuous and will be imperiled if they sufficiently displease the west.

The large Chinese economy is based mostly on exports. They import many raw materials and the goods produced mostly go abroad, I think 70% going to western countries.  This of course leaves them very vulnerable to sanctions from western countries should they say, invade a neighbor, including Taiwan.

They also import the majority of their oil, upon which they are dependent for energy as well as for a raw material in export products.  They get some from Russia, an ally of convenience, but most from the middle east, easily cutoff because of the limited routes into the South China Sea by even many small regional countries.  Without his oil mass starvation would begin to happen within a few months.

He discusses the extreme level of corruption and how political and government offices as well as military rank is used as a license to steal.  So cronyism prevails over efficiency, and as for the military it creates a high level of incompetence, also exacerbated by the ~20% of time officers are required to study communist ideology.  

Their military is untested and so will make more mistakes than the usual large number of mistakes every country makes at the start of the war.  Their military is permitted to own private for profit businesses and industry with little to no outside oversight.  This makes it an embezzlement cash cow for high ranking military officers, and prioritizes prioritizes profitability and corrupt cash flow over producing effective weapons and stockpiles, much of which may exist only on paper.  Their military tech development has relied heavily on stealing and copying technology, including that in the weapons and aircraft they have bought from Russia.  They were buying all their jet engines from Russia until recently, but the engines they are building in house leave their jets underpowered.  Their submarines are reportedly laughably loud and easily detected by our navy.  In other ways China is 20 years behind in military technology and is not positioned to be able to massively invest to the extent required to catch up.

Similarly, their military tech is untried and so has  not had all the bugs worked out.  Of course, a blockade on oil imports would dictate rapid military success, or failure due to lack of fuel.

China’s foreign policy does not lead to friendship.  Unlike the US that has spread it’s money around as diplomacy, China drives hard bargains.  The investment in Africa, for example, benefits China more than the target country to the point of exploitation.  As for regional neighbors, China has become a bully with it’s large military.  Rather than making them want to be friends with China, these countries are building up their own militaries, making it necessary for China to invest even more in it’s military.

So if China steps out of line by invading a regional neighbor, it is highly likely other regional neighbors will cut off their oil imports, the US, Japan, and other western economies will place extreme sanctions on trade with China, as well as cut off their access to capital reserves held in foreign currencies in foreign markets.

Back around to China’s limited access to the Pacific, Zeihan makes much of how the US navy has made it safe for any and all countries to ply the ocean for trade and naval access.  He believes the US will decide to quit playing policeman to the world and that this will have a wilting effect on international commerce as mediated by ocean-going freighters.  Because of the way China is hemmed in, they would need a larger navy with longer-ranging capacity to punch through the very long and narrow routes they must sail to get to the Pacific. 

He said more in these videos but this is my summary.  I am not saying I agree with everything he says.  In fact, I hope he is largely wrong.  I am just saying what I recall him saying.",54366c6f37ed56da90d6299975c899f7b93a4888,True,False,,,,,0,1652635724,,0,{},i8puxuq,False,t3_hv46xb,False,True,t3_hv46xb,/r/geopolitics/comments/hv46xb/what_are_the_most_legitimate_criticisms_of_peter/i8puxuq/,1652635742,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652606924.0

First of all, Western politicians (or any politicians) aren't quite celebrated for the consistency of their public speeches. And that doesn't even matter that much, because they're in little to no control of the outcome of the war. The warring parties are.

Second, the economic analysis is just wrong (not surprising, given the primary source). Here are a few excerpts from the [report](http://www.cbr.ru/about_br/publ/ddkp/longread_2_38/) of the Central Bank of Russia:

* Inflation in 2022: between 18-23%
* GDP decrease: between 8-10%
* Exports decrease: between 17-21%
* Imports decrease: between 32.5-36.5% 

And that's even without accounting for factors that are impossible to account for:

* The plane park is mostly screwed. Most of the planes are considered legally stolen, and there's nowhere to get spare parts from. How much will this affect?
* How many imported pieces are required in every particular produced good? Mind you, even if 1% of the good is dependent on the imported parts, it's impossible to produce without them. For instance, automobile production has decreased fivefold since the start of the war.
* The currency course is basically manipulated by the Central Bank to look good, which they can do because now the Ruble is a nonconvertible currency for most means and purposes.
* ...

So, the report of the original source is a classic manipulation, but an honest answer as to what will happen to the Russian economy is that we don't know. There are good reasons to expect much worse. If you're an investor, that's what you ought to think.

The narrative of Western disunity is once again, quite mistaken. Hardly anyone at 23.02.2022 could've imagined the amount of the coordinated action that is taken now. The embargo on the Russian oil &amp; gas is a question of when not if. Even Hungary doesn't veto the embargo itself. It demands a postponement - because it's economically impossible to cut off the pipe today, for any government that would've been in Budapest.

Also, there are some obvious red flags in the article, such as stating that certain EU officials have an irrational fear of Russians. And what in the world made the author think that Nord Stream 2 is ever going to be used?

The last 3 paragraphs are not factually wrong, because they're not derived from the rest of the contents. I agree that Karl Marx saw what many people can't see even today, for instance, that there are forces that are created by the condition of our society, that are beyond the control of a single individual or group thereof. And warfare has changed dramatically since the glory days of the famous German general.

Which seems like it would support an honest statement that we don't really know how it can end? But no. The author predicts a quite specific conclusion, that once again cannot be derived even from the most consistent part of the text.",e9e649937e87e0a059b20b8196befccd130a3c7f,True,False,,,,,0,1652635102,,0,{},i8pthkn,False,t3_uq9m5l,False,True,t3_uq9m5l,/r/geopolitics/comments/uq9m5l/why_ukraine_war_has_no_winners/i8pthkn/,1652635116,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652606302.0

UN matters here, if one dont hold any status then getting invaded will give ZERO repercussions (Taiwan still is considered a possible China candidate so they are still good), and any embargo/trade barriers etc will also be invalid by the WTO, all of those moves done to Russia WONT be able to be used at all due to this. You also cant be independent without the UN rules to help you these days.....

There is no ambiguity... the PRC is China within the United Nations.

And the United Nations is irrelevant here. Taiwan holds zero status within the UN, not even observer status. Taiwan is however a member of the WTO, so I'm not sure what you mean by that... they are two separate and independent organizations. Neither of those organizations are governments, neither have the power to recognize who is and isn't an independent state within international law.

[Directly from the United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/about-un-membership):
&gt;The recognition of a new State or Government is an act that only other States and Governments may grant or withhold. It generally implies readiness to assume diplomatic relations. The United Nations is neither a State nor a Government, and therefore does not possess any authority to recognize either a State or a Government.

Within international law, [the Montevideo Convention](https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210596800s003-c002) is still the most accepted definition of an independent country/state within international law. The key point on the Montevideo Convention is that:

&gt;The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.

Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea are all sovereign independent states within international law under the Montevideo Convention.

----
&gt;Your totally using the WRONG example.... NKorea and SKorea is also in Civil war, and for sure not sovereign by the UN. Just like Taiwan and China and they are for sure not sovereign. hell SKoreans themselves dont consider themselves to be either, but they seem to be more logical knows more english and also inline with UN rules than anyone which brushes off anything UN. Of course they are being acknowledged by many ""western democratic"" countries as sovereign, but for sure they are not ""legally"". Just search for it (not on wiki)

? North Korea and South Korea are two sovereign independent states, engaged in a dormant civil war. Just like Taiwan (ROC) and PRC, both are sovereign independent states within international law. This has nothing to do with Koreans speaking better English. 

----
&gt;Oh the UN charter is only around 100ish articles, so it is short enough for you go to read yourself being its too much to post here and not proper to post on this def reddit. Each article relates to each other so you need to read ALL of it (only like a 15-30min read though), is in the simpler legal language being too technical means more loop holes.

I've already read the Charter... but I am unsure where it applies within your argument. As I've asked, if you are going to cite the Charter or a Resolution please cite the specific Article or Chapter you are referencing to.

As you are aware I'm sure, the vast majority of UN Resolutions are only binding to each state that independently ratifies those UN Resolutions within it's own domestic political and legal system. The vast majority of UN Resolutions are non-binding... again, [directly from the United Nations](https://ask.un.org/faq/14484):

&gt;With the exception of decisions regarding payments to the regular and peacekeeping budgets of the UN, General Assembly resolutions/decisions are not binding for Member States. The implementation of the policy recommendations contained in resolutions/decisions is the responsibility of each Member State. 

----
&gt;The constitutional law is not meant for territorial claims, that goes else where, its meant for the formation of the country/state. Do we need to start from the basics of government? Thats like pre-college stuff....... please go read up on this too .

Correct, which is why the Republic of China and People's Republic of China each have their own Constitution.

----
&gt;Its like saying Republic of China dont have the ""exact"" word China in it because there are other words next to it........ Are you even living in Taiwan? please study more chinese if your really there, 中華民國 is right there in RoC's country name... go wiki each character.

Do you understand the difference between 中國 and 中華?

I'll just address Japan if that's okay. Japan wasn't interested in joining the ""global community"" - this was forced on them at gunpoint by Admiral Perry. 

Once Japan joined the world, they were a wunderkind student. They joined the ""right side"" in WW1. And that's where it fell apart - the Allies transferred Central Power colonies to each other, but Japan was excluded. This was the ""White Man's Burden"". Asia had to remain in European hands. 

Japan did attempt to engage in trade in the interwar period. The solution to this were the ""Yellow Laws"" of the coastal US, which prohibited Japanese businessmen from staying overnight in the US. 

If you're an earnest Japanese leader in this period, the problem becomes pretty obvious (and it was the same conclusion reached by Mao, Uncle Ho, and Kim Jung Il) - the West was racist. If you failed to make your own empire, the West would make your country a colony. 

Japan's core strategic imperative was to retain control of their own destiny. This was the same a century ago, and it was the same in WW2. The concept of empire was alien to Japan, but they tried to play that game because they saw it as a binary choice: Empire or Colony. 

(fwiw, the West has cultivated a fantastic relationship with Japan after WW2. If that had been on offer in 1920 or 1930, Japan would have never gone to war in the first place).",2403a8fc9856f3f2199722772871280d7a11fc4f,True,False,,,,,0,1652584969,,0,{},i8nl6zi,False,t3_uotw8w,False,True,t1_i8ngltj,/r/geopolitics/comments/uotw8w/no_marshall_plan_for_ukraine_geography_and/i8nl6zi/,1652584985,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652556169.0

This is revisionist nonsense. 

Japan and Germany thrived under the post-war order, because they were scientific and industrial powerhouses to begin with, and because the US gave them unfettered access to the American market in order to build them up as bulwark against Communism. 

None of the above was dependent on whether the British and French Empires were still around or not. African and Indian markets were impoverished (still are), difficult to access, and their post-WW2 liberation meant nothing for the export machine that brought prosperity to Japan and Germany.

And yes, by fighting each other to death, the Axis powers did contribute greatly in bringing Britain and France down to their level.
