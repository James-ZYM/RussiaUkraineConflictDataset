Ukraine wanted to join NATO from 2008 before any of this ordeal including Crimea annexation and allegations of Russian backing separatist in Donbas. In fact even till late 2013 the Russian is still helping Ukraine financially which never paid back fully and gave them lots of benefit such as free trade, etc.

So the reason of Ukraine wanted to join NATO is not because Russia attacking them.

You failed to see that many are actually not happy with the action of US in handling this crisis including Macron. The statement and action from US is very clear provocation, there is no effort from them for a peaceful talks. Only after the inflation and lots of domestic issues emerges, US backs off a little bit. However fuel has been sprayed out. US is far from the conflict zone and EU lost far more than US. So I think it would be best if the US shut their mouth and let EU handle.

You are free to to choose to join NATO. However you can’t choose your neighbors. So as I said what Ukraine did was not wise. I mean sure Russia should not invade, however Ukraine is not even eligible to join, why don’t they put it in paper and save lives? Was it worth it to destroys their country over something they are not even able to join anyway? Isn’t better to maintain good relationship with your neighbors? It would make more sense to have alliance with all of your neighbors. If they keep balanced affiliation they can reap the benefit and there is no war today.

NATO as defensive alliance can do any offense at anytime, saying otherwise is a bullshit. Missiles will be minutes away from Moscow. In case Ukraine joins NATO, then Russia has to put effort to put defensive capabilities to in the border which increase their military spendings. There are many reasons they doesn’t like NATO in their border those are just few things I can mention. I don’t like it too if I were Russian. If you truly put your shoes in Russian position you wouldn’t like it too. You probably can’t imagine it or refused to acknowledge this fact because you are on the western side.

We will see who will win. I think too early to celebrate anyway. Even if Ukraine won, half of their country is destroyed and rebuilding will be PITA. They will fell under US control, who can refuse any request from a country who helped them with billions? In my eyes as of now Ukraine is being sold pieces by pieces.",008031d6261d41c2394e484907018a7c4b3d26c5,True,False,,,,,0,1652658520,,0,{},i8r9ocy,False,t3_uq45rm,False,True,t1_i8po4pl,/r/war/comments/uq45rm/describe_the_criteria_you_use_to_take_side_in_war/i8r9ocy/,1652658533,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1652629720.0

Ukrainians are nazis only on pictures or they also occupie sovereign countries ? 

Did Ukraine attacked Georgia, Moldova, Chechnia, Syria ? No

So Based on Russians accusation Ukrainians are Nazis only on pictures but Russians are Nazis based on their actions  and unhealthy Nazi ambitions.

This is fact.

Listen I don't give a shit about pictures and videos because it makes no sense unless you are brainwashed, l'll explain you why.

You are saying that Ukrainians are Nazis, do you know what Ukraine population is ? It's 40 million.

How many Ukrainian Nazi pictures and videos do you have 10 million 20, 30 ?

How you can claim from 8 pictures or even 500 pictures that Ukrainians are nazis ? That is not even 0.01% of Ukrainian population.

Russia has Nazis, Sweden has Nazis, US has nazis and because Russia has more population it also has more Nazis than Ukraine.

WTF ?

It was planned long time a go. 

Ukrainian Nazis are Russian code name for regime change.

But for you to understand better listen to this 30 years old prophecy from chechnias first president who of course was assassinated by Russians just like they tired to assassinate Zelenski. 

All this was planned long time a go, Ukraine was their last hope and they fucked it up:

This argument is one Russia has long run with and it doesn't make any sense. If independent states wish to join NATO because they are scared of being invaded by Russia, if they are worried about Russia backing a coup in their country, that's hardly a provocation of Russia.

As it turned out, those nations that were formerly the subjects of the USSR which later joined NATO had everything to fear from Russia. This invasion and the massive loss of life that resulted was only possible because Ukraine was not a member of NATO. Every country that joined is surely thinking now what a good idea that was.

The worst being the Armenian genocide and cultural cleaning, but there is also the Tunceli massacre in 1937, the [Lice massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lice_massacre) where the turkish army killed 30 civilians, and if you want more recent reports, you have Amnesty International's reports of [turkish war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lice_massacre) in Syria.
2. What I mean is that PKK forces usually target turkish armed forces. Like in a war. Except for a few sad events, They don't target civilians. They don't try to kill as many citizens as possible.  ISIS bombs people going to work in the morning, people at a concert, people in trains,...
3. Of course kidnapping civilians is wrong, but the direct democracy is a nice project. It's the opposite of authoritarian communism like in North Korea or in the Soviet Union.

All this bullshit about neonazis in Azov is ridiculous. Yeah the founder of the Azov is a problematic figure with far right views but he is no longer in charge. There even are Jews in the Azov. Of course there are some radicals in the Ukrainian military (btw as in any military), but it's really an exception because radical views in Ukraine aren't popular (radical parties have only 2% of seats in our parliament and we also have a big jewish diaspora).",5b3eab883f5b8decc3a280e92c368b63814198b1,True,False,,,,,0,1652576141,,0,{},i8n4li0,False,t3_up0ib8,False,True,t1_i8m5248,/r/war/comments/up0ib8/footage_of_the_bombingrussian_village_soloha/i8n4li0/,1652576157,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1652547341.0
