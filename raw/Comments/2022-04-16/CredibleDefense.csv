Most of those killed are described as major generals in Russia, which equates to one-star officers, like brigadier generals in the West.

That's actually false. Russian generals are getting killed as they're being heavily targeted by the Ukrainians, made easier because they have a duty to move near the front lines to do their jobs, plus a historic Russian military tradition for senior officers to take risks to demonstrate bravery and to improve troop morale.

While the Russians do have an NCO corps it's not as developed as in the West, but it's there from the squad level to ""first sergeant"" equivalent. However, commissioned officers have a far larger role, duties, and responsibilities than western company grade officers, and there is no platoon sergeant equivalent position in the Russian system. With their system, platoon leaders and company commanders routinely ""take point,"" especially in vehicle movements, and are much more likely to take charge with a ""follow me"" mentality.

I think it should have produced an effect at least as strong as a tactical nuke, and trigger some response from NATO countries and Poland allies(admittedly, Poland itself wasn't very active). Maybe demand for a fair investigation at least(i.e. the one where Russia is not a lead investigator).

My point is - I think people overestimate tactical nukes. Sure, destruction would be massive.

Russia has a system that allows their competent officers to stay in command slots almost as long as they want. That has its pro and cons but it's biggest weakness is meat grinder conflicts because they can't be easily replaced. High performing experienced commanders might have 5-8 years commanding a single unit, and in that type of officer corps the limited rotation means a smaller number of experienced commanders at all levels. Their culture is that commanders tend to command and staff officers tend to do staff. The generals running divisions and higher are often studs within the RuGF and VDV, veterans of Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, and Syria.

Only the S-300 and Buk-M1 and later variants can reach the altitudes of Russia strategic bombers, the Tu-160, Tu-95, and Tu-22M at 40,000+ feet. The Buk-M1 can only provide local air defense at those altitudes. The Tu-160 and Tu-22M are both capable of supersonic dash speeds as a method to avoid air defenses over targets. Both the S-300 and Buk systems Ukrainian operates are Soviet era systems that probably haven't seen much, if any, upgrades. The S-300 donated by Slovakia is a Russian S-300PMU which is more modern export variant. Being these are Soviet/Russian systems the question of ECM is more than valid, and ECCM to point as Ukraine possessed the Tu-95 and Tu-160 for a bit. Some were traded back to Russia for debt relief, some were destroyed under Nunn–Lugar.

Apart from that Russia has released their typical PR style videos showing Su-30/35 pairings flying ""Wild Weasel"" style sorties. SAM sites in a active war do not typically operate their search radars, doing so makes them easily detectable to be fired on by a Anti-Radiation Missile(ARM). Rather a target is visually identified locally or by a forward observer or from intelligence/SIGINT. Most S-300 and Buk variants are Semi-Active Radar Homing(SARH), so the target needs to be illuminated by a radar until the point of impact. So the search/acquisition radar needs to be engaged to direct the missile towards the calculated vector, then the illumination radar needs to ""paint"" the target once the missile has come within range of it's radar receiver until impact. Wild Weasel sorties attempt to bait radar(s) by flying one fast lightly loaded maneuverable aircraft that can (hopefully) outmaneuver the missiles, while a second aircraft fires heavy long range ASMs at the radar.  

Strategic bombing, as the name implies, doesn't aim for accuracy. The goal is to destroy the morale, economy, and the general overall ability of the enemy to continue war. It requires large volumes of bombs.

Nobody knows for sure how many S-300 batteries Ukraine has left operational, or how many missiles they have left. The effects of ECM and ECCM. Expect for active participants in the conflict, anyways.

Things like how powerful is Russia (could they reach the Rhine in 7 days like the USSR), how permanent is Finland/Swede neutrality outside of NATO (apparently not forever), and of course things like drones changing the balance away from tanks (though Armenia/Azerbijan showed that as well). So, why not examine more ""common sense"" things, widely held conceptions that seem unquestionable (no-fly zones still seem too far, but then again smaller ones instead of Ukraine-wide NFZs would be easier, etc)?

While I think there is a legal pathway to kicking Russia out, and it is interesting to think about, I would suggest beyond the scope of this article (can it be done) is should it be done? If we need to hold the door open to diplomacy then pushing Russia out **closes that door** to diplomacy. Russia, if backed into a corner more than it is today, would lash out even harder. I do not think it would lead to WW3 right away, but I could see Russia using more banned munitions and other war crimes if they have to finish up *even faster* cause they can't protect themselves on the UNSC. They may rely on China for **short term** UNSC cover but China will not bat down any proposal forever, even if Vetoes never cost them anything (because the West doesn't want to get into an economic war with China). But that is not sustainable for Russia forever, and being backed into a corner means they will fight harder and dirtier; I do not think it opens up the options for nuclear weapons, but chemical weapons (not biological, I think they are too unpredictable) might come into play. 

However this entire idea rests on the idea that the rest of the wrold will follow the West in booting Russia out of the United Nations.

But surely they'd be far more encouraged if they believed that the option of mobilisation would actually effect the outcome of the war? If the intention is to make Russia lose either way then we should ensure that we take the option of mobilisation outside of the realm of viability before it gets exercised. This entire argument is built on the idea that Russia will refuse to mobilise if the west is more cautious with their aid but that pillar isn't founded on anything but hope.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Except they wouldn't ""lose"" by shifting the framing as a defensive war against NATO. They'd ""win"" by maintaining their borders. This is entirely a question of narrative - ""NATO sent all of their best equipment to invade Russia and we held them back.""

But it would still be a _proxy_ war against NATO and Russia being forced to mobilise just to contain an intervention in Ukraine would do huge damage to their image domestically and internationally. Russians aren't completely cut off from the outside world and if they see that the west isn't mobilising or talk to friends/family in Eastern Europe it falls apart.

That's when the people in St. Petersburg start getting really anxious because suddenly there are now thousands of NATO troops stationed right outside their borders and Russia has already proven that it can't even win when the west has it's hands tied behind it's back.

University of Colorado conducted an opinion poll of residents of the Donbas about what they want the ultimate fate of their region to be. The tl;Dr is as one would expect, there is a sharp divide in opinion based on which side of the front line the person is located, with large majorities of residents in Ukrainian held Donbas preferring to remain a part of Ukraine and a majority of those in Russian controlled Donbas wanting to be a part of Russia in some capacity. 2 major caveats:

&gt;Tanks exist on the battlefield not because they're invincible, but because they fill a role that currently no other weapon platform can supplant at comparable cost.

Going into WW1, nothing could supplant the role of cavalry at comparable cost, speed or reliability. Tanks were slow, expensive, prone to breakdown, and would take most of the war to develop. But cavalry *still* fell out of favor, despite no replacement at the time, simply because they were too vulnerable. The men would be better used as infantry, and the horses better used hauling artillery, then used together as sabre-armed cavalry. 

&gt;Unless ATGMs made them completely infeasible of performing that role

Well that's the whole debate isn't it? Do modern ATGMs constitute such a deadly and intractable foe to the tank that MBTs no longer provide superior utility on the battlefield compared to that same crew used to man something else?

I do think it's rather telling that the only solution I've seen proposed to something like the javelin - a fire and forget top attack missile with twice the range of the tanks its hunting and which can reliably penetrate any AFV in production - is ""I hope active protection systems get better soon"". 

&gt; Tanks aren't going anywhere because there's nothing to replace them no matter how much it sucks to sit in a rolling coffin.

I'd say a third possibility is: The nature of warfare changes yet again. A world dominated by drones, artillery, and PGMs, where the average range of a kill is measured in kilometers without the aggressor being visible.   

Prior to the Ukrainian war, I saw a great number of papers describing MBTs as ""the only thing survivable in a close combat role on a modern high intensity battlefield"". It seems not unreasonable to me that that is no longer true, and in fact *nothing* is survivable anymore. Weapons have become too lethal, and we must look to a future were close combat is an inherently high attrition affair.

Also depends on what's available in the area already. Is there enough access to safe water that water can be ignored? Water available but not safe ( purification tabs/systems). No water so it must be delivered?

MREs are not the most calorie dense option necessarily. Good but not ideal in general under extremely limited supply situations. That's when things like peanut butter and mayonnaise come in. Very calorie dense and still a passable amount of protein. Goes further than almost anything else. Oil and uncooked high protein grains are another route with the drawback of preparation. Slightly more sustainable for that cost.

Water is most critical, then ammo and meds/first aid kit, and finally food. At least on a timescale measured in weeks.

I'd guess an ideal supply package in that situation would be plenty of water purification tabs, aid kits, ammo including some weight efficient anti armor and improvisable explosives, and very calorie dense foods that practically can't spoil like the aforementioned peanut butter.

Just to give a napkin math calorie comparison, a KG of peanut butter is about 6k calories and includes around 250g protein, a solid ratio. A Ukrainian MRE is roughly 2 to 2.5 KG for  around 4.5k calories. So the peanut butter/mayo or grain + oil approach can easily double to maybe triple calories per unit weight. It will suck to live off, but if the supply situation is as tight as it likely is and has been it's probably an acceptable trade off. 

That said, if the situation is critical enough, maybe the food is dropped and scrounging plus whatever was stockpiled is relied entirely upon.",b3f790c5ec8d089d22c9e3071140724cc0fa5583,True,False,,,,,0,1650140649,,0,{},i4zylfr,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i4zfd62,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i4zylfr/,1650140660,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650111849.0,

The symbiotic relationship helps a lot in making the tech actually cost-viable and able to be mass produced and deployed.

I suppose we only need like 50-100 railguns total for naval combat, but I'm not sure they're all that useful when they're primarily just main gun upgrades, and main guns haven't been terribly relevant for about 80 years to begin with. Lasers are very useful for missile/drone swarm defense, the current primary threat, and also can probably end up very useful for anti-air as well, allowing the ship to save its SAM stocks, if not replace them entirely with yet more offensive missiles. If you can take all the SAMs out of a ship and leave it with just anti-naval missiles, you've drastically upgraded its offensive capabilities with a purely defensive armament.

Anyone that was familiar even a bit with the early history of US-AUS relations would know that isn't true. 

The US was reluctant to sign a security treaty with Australia after WW2 despite Australia fighting in the Pacific and SEA against the Japanese. Australia committing troops to the war in Korea, the creation of antagonistic Communist China and the need to bribe AUS and NZ in foregoing a punitive peace treaty with Japan so that the US could make them a strong ally against the communists are the factors that led to the creation of ANZUS.

If ""family"" meant what you think it meant, ANZUS would have been signed in 1946, not 1951, the wording would be a lot more precise and it wouldn't have required the alignment of interests to do so. 

Do you know why Australia joins in every single US war, even though most of them have nothing to do with it? Because it is deeply insecure about the willingness of the US to defend it when SHTF.

This worked well in WW1 and WW2 and for a short period afterwards (think the Arab-Israeli wars). But since then, personal anti tank have gotten so advanced it just doesn't make sense. As the russians have seen, breaking through their lines simply means facing a firing squad of cheap anti-tank weapons. 

Just like the cavalry ceased to be useful after infantry stopped forming into lines and ranks that could be easily broken up by men on horseback, the tanks aren't going to be very useful any longer because the types of entrenched positions we saw in WW1, WW2, Korea and a few other conflicts just isn't there anymore.

[],False,,dilligaf4lyfe,,,[],,,,text,t2_hu461,False,False,"&gt;Firstly, if Russia wanted to claim that they're fighting NATO they're already completely capable of them doing so and there's no reason they have to be losing to do it. There are already a lot of volunteers from western countries many of which are military veterans and so by simply sticking NATO ensigns on them or falsifying recordings they could already create a ""_credible_"" narrative of extensive clandestine operations within Ukraine. It definitely doesn't help in that regard that Ukranians are running their mouths about receiving training from within Ukraine by British soldiers.

This is all true. But the point was that fullbore NATO armament would encourage them to excercise the option of full-blown mobilization and a ""defensive"" war, not that they don't have the option already.

&gt;Secondly, losing to NATO in a contained proxy conflict destroys many national myths that Russia has cultivated about both their own capabilities and the capabilities of the west. The Russian people have seen a huge decline in their standards of living as a consequence of sanctions and if they don't even have security to compensate for it then that surely presents a damning criticism of the current administration. Worse still, if they're forced to mobilise but the west can beat them back without even using their own forces (particularly in the air) while still having a sizable and growing military presence on their now expanded border that would turn what have largely been unfounded fears about a western invasion of Russia very real in the minds of the Russian people.

Except they wouldn't ""lose"" by shifting the framing as a defensive war against NATO. They'd ""win"" by maintaining their borders. This is entirely a question of narrative - ""NATO sent all of their best equipment to invade Russia and we held them back.""

It's an obviously thin narrative, but all of the points you mention here apply already. Russia is already probably going to lose a proxy war with NATO. How they explain it is the big question. 

&gt;Finally, they already have a perfect excuse for why the invasion hasn't been a success: ""_it was only ever a special military operation_"". If Russia fully commits to calling it a war that means the extent of their successes and failures must be representative of the quality of their armed forces overall. So long as it's just a limited military intervention then they're welcome to redefine their success as is convenient and lose to ""NATO"" by citing asymmetric escalation or a desire to avoid endangering civilians.

This is true to an extent I suppose, although I'm not sure what distinction losing a special military operation versus a war really  holds. Would they rather lose a special operation or pretend to win a broader war?",eac7c4c7b3ed2a2823433f4d07e588ff585b26dc,True,False,,,,,0,1650138552,,0,{},i4ztyi8,False,t3_u46gf9,False,True,t1_i4z41yv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u46gf9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_15_2022/i4ztyi8/,1650138566,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650109752.0,

Yeah. I agree with all of what you said. I just think that it's important to emphasize the way we look at these things.

In my humble opinion, I believe that we should try to set aside what we knew about China yesterday, and, for a moment, just look at what it has on paper today. China on paper is getting stronger at an alarming rate. Then factor in what you knew about China yesterday and we know that even though China has capability on paper, we know nothing of the *quality* and *experience* of these systems. This doesn't necessarily mean that they won't work and they won't work well. It's just that we don't know.

People in discussion often have trouble leaving something in ""I don't know"" limbo. They have to assign everything to either ""it's really good"" or ""it's really bad"". You have to treat that in terms of probability, confidence or error. Ideally, we ought to leave enough room for error so that if we miscalculate, it won't be unrecoverable right?

That's why I always think that it's better to be safe than sorry. Safe doesn't mean we fear monger ourselves into wartime economy or something but it should be all the more reason to press forward with prudent research, development and acquisition in a practical and responsible way and without stopping.

My greatest fear isn't China getting stronger. My greatest fear is, again, that we grow complacent, or we miscalculate by not leaving enough room for error.",5a9f67ef6a659945edb5bdff72f87232c256f936,True,False,,,,,0,1650137151,,0,{},i4zqw9v,False,t3_u4xjic,False,True,t1_i4z9n4q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4xjic/chinas_dreadnought_the_pla_navys_type_055_cruiser/i4zqw9v/,1650137167,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650108351.0,

A huge factor here is relative capital costs. Nuclear plants are billions, and probably a decade to get built in the best case. Renewables cost millions and have ROI on the scale of a year or two. Gas turbine plants cost millions and similar near immediate ROI (thanks to lack of a real carbon tax or such but that's a whole nother discussion).

Anyhow, what that means is as economies have built out renewables, they've also supplemented them with gas turbines to handle the intermittent capacity factor. The combo is simple, cheap, and fast to build in comparison to nuclear. Rather dramatically so.

On top of that, the trend in cost of grid scale energy storage is dramatic. There's still significant barriers to getting to a pure renewables + storage future, but on the time scale of planning for a nuclear plant (10 years build, 40 operating life, 20 years decommissioning) the natural question an investor is going to ask is ""why should I write this check if I'm already getting squeezed in the market by gas plus renewables, and in 30 years pure renewables plus storage could plausibly make that even worse?""

Russian officials said Saturday that another of its generals, deputy commander of the 8th Army Maj. Gen. Vladimir Frolov, was killed in combat in Ukraine. They didn’t provide details, but several other generals have already been killed in the conflict, particularly in the early days in the campaign.

Some have been veterans of previous conflicts in Georgia and Syria, where Russia also lost generals, robbing Moscow of potentially valuable battlefield experience.

Some military analysts have attributed the losses to the Russian military’s fighting style. It has comparatively fewer noncommissioned officers to lead operations in the field compared with U.S. forces, leaving generals to take more vulnerable positions further forward. Most of those killed are described as major generals in Russia, which equates to one-star officers, like brigadier generals in the West.

There are also a larger proportion of senior officers compared with Western militaries.

Maj. Gen. Frolov was buried Saturday in St. Petersburg, RIA Novosti reported. The forces he commanded had been deployed to the area around Mariupol, a strategic port on the Sea of Azov which is currently besieged by Russian forces.",b14f3d9e9d159d984e59ccb18240426fa08b5779,True,False,,,,,0,1650132768,,0,{},i4zh4zd,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i4zd6yy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i4zh4zd/,1650132780,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650103968.0,

From the conclusion:

&gt; Engaging Article 6 of the U.N. Charter to expel Russia is not, in fact or law, prevented by Russia’s status as a permanent member of the Security Council. Whether Putin and his agents in the government and military on the ground in Ukraine ought to be prosecuted as war criminals, or even whether Russia should be expelled from the U.N. for directly endangering international peace by waging an unlawful war of aggression against the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighbor and its noncombatant citizens, are deeply complicated geopolitical questions for which this post admittedly offers no hint of an answer. Instead, there is some reason to be optimistic, rather than cynical, about the global community’s legal right to hold even a Security Council permanent member accountable for its illegality by removing that offender from the community itself, as both a deterrent and an expressive signal of how much the global communities values the principles of the U.N. project. I suspect that this view does not appeal to the governments of any of the other four permanent members. But one consequence of making expulsion a real possibility is that it would shift attention to the justification required—the evidence of “persistent violations” that must be presented for the consideration of the General Assembly.

To start with they don't have the infrastructure to house them all, support them, equip them, so that is their first priority, to build that.

Then they have to induct all the reservists, most of whom are going to be poorly trained, out of shape, of the wrong MOS that will require retraining. 

Same goes for conscripts. Additionally, they'll need to change the laws to make conscription 24 months again vice 12 months as it is now, as that's way too short. Probably need to enact a Stop Loss policy so the current crops of conscripts aren't discharged.

They won't have enough NCOs and officers and well trained junior enlisted from the reserves to build new units so they'll have to pull them from existing combat units to use as cadre. This is INCREDIBLY disruptive to unit effectiveness, it means combat units losing upwards of 25% or more of their manpower overnight, often the better ones too. Those individuals then form the backbone of the new units as they are filled up with junior enlisted activated reservists and conscripts. If they do this, their newer units will have a chance to be decent but it'll gut their existing force structure. If they don't do it then all the new units will be ""the blind leading the blind."" 

They'll also going to have to rebuild their leadership system, they're going to need 90 wonder junior officers again and shake and bake sergeants. The days of wanting a professional volunteer military force are over, it's now about quantity over quality. Additionally, pretty much every officer in the military gets bumped up at least one rank, more likely two. Most decent NCOs will need to be commissioned as junior officers. 

While all this is happening they're going to have to itemize every piece of equipment they have in storage, conduct overhauls, and move all that stuff to the bases where the new units are going to be built. They'll also need ammo pulled out of storage for them or made from scratch by factories who will have to go to 3x shifts a day and still likely need to expand as well. In addition to ammo war stocks they'll need more for training too.

I dont think any of you were wrong per se in thinking that China lacks the institutional knowledge.

I dont find the dismissive attitude of our enemies to be wise at all. I see comments about ""China is just ripping off stuff from other people"" literally any time China gets brought up - again this is a valid, supported and justified point. However, the entire point of articles watching the Chinese and their capabilities suggest that they are very much capable of producing their own stuff that actually cant just be dismissed as vaporware or ""sub par quality"".

I downvote because coming to these conclusions and being dismissive of your enemies very easily leads to the thinking that ""we have time and they are neve going to catch up"". I dont know what it takes to convince people like those in this comment chain that China is making progress, catching up, and in some areas slightly exceeding the U.S.

I dont for a moment think China is somehow better than the U.S already - like you said, they have literally zero combat experience to go off of and thus next to zero ability to really know how well or not well their weapons work. But that doesnt mean we can just dismiss them or Russia. These two countries arent just stagnant. If you get complacent, they will one day catch up - just like how China is in shipbuilding ability.

This isnt just a military thing either. People in this society need to not be complacent. Lawmakers need to be not be complacent. And that's my greatest fear post Ukraine - we look at how shitty Russia did, assume China is the same, then get complacent.

Firstly, if Russia wanted to claim that they're fighting NATO they're already completely capable of them doing so and there's no reason they have to be losing to do it. There are already a lot of volunteers from western countries many of which are military veterans and so by simply sticking NATO ensigns on them or falsifying recordings they could already create a ""_credible_"" narrative of extensive clandestine operations within Ukraine. It definitely doesn't help in that regard that Ukranians are running their mouths about receiving training from within Ukraine by British soldiers.

Secondly, losing to NATO in a contained proxy conflict destroys many national myths that Russia has cultivated about both their own capabilities and the capabilities of the west. The Russian people have seen a huge decline in their standards of living as a consequence of sanctions and if they don't even have security to compensate for it then that surely presents a damning criticism of the current administration. Worse still, if they're forced to mobilise but the west can beat them back without even using their own forces (particularly in the air) while still having a sizable and growing military presence on their now expanded border that would turn what have largely been unfounded fears about a western invasion of Russia very real.

Finally, they already have a perfect excuse for why the invasion hasn't been a success: ""_it was only ever a special military operation_"". If Russia fully commits to calling it a war that means the extent of their successes and failures must be representative of the quality of their armed forces overall.

[],False,,abloblololo,,,[],,,,text,t2_qhbwl,False,False,"There are a few potential obstacles with that approach. Generally speaking, pulsed lasers are more complicated to build and operate, and typically run at much lower average power. There has [been progress](https://opg.optica.org/ol/fulltext.cfm?uri=ol-45-11-3083&amp;id=432142) towards higher power pulsed systems, but they are much less mature and robust than CW ones.

But let's say we can get whatever laser we want, then there's the issue of what happens to the laser pulse once it's in the air. Such powerful pulses doesn't necessarily interact the way you'd think, and they wouldn't really ""clear the way"" for the next pulse by somehow annihilating the matter. Instead, what would likely happen is that the electric field strength in the laser pulse would be sufficiently high to ionize the air, which has the opposite effect of what you want (the resulting plasma will effectively block the following pulses). You can observe this with much weaker lasers than what we're discussing here, but it would depend on how large the beam is. This phenomena can also occur when you hit the target itself (I've seen it myself with pulsed lasers hitting metal). So the basic problem is that if you concentrate enough energy to for example ablate material off of the target, you will likely have strong interactions with the atmosphere as well. Furthermore, it's generally desirable to perform laser ablation with short wavelengths (which have higher photon energy) but those are more strongly absorbed by the air.

There is a final wrinkle, which is that very strong laser light experiences something called Kerr self focusing, which causes the beam to shrink and stop spreading out. This can then lead to the formation of a plasma that helps stabilize the propagation of the beam. In theory this can be used to overcome some of the challenges with traditional DEWs, but thus far no one has created these plasmas over any meaningful distance (meters at most) and much of the laser energy is lost in the process. An interesting aspect though is that if the plasma is maintained from the laser to the target, that's a conducting channel that could be used to disturb the target electrically (but that might as well be sci-fi).",fa275233fc23c377e52358522236cbbc45247a5c,True,False,,,,,0,1650126857,,0,{},i4z3duf,False,t3_u4nqds,False,True,t1_i4ytoeo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4nqds/us_navy_conducts_historic_test_of_new_laser/i4z3duf/,1650126868,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650098057.0,

Whether Ukraine wins or loses strategically has little to do with my point - that Russia has already lost strategically. This is an important caveat because we are specifically speaking to Western engagement in this war, and speaking to their long-term interests in funding it. The West has already won and there's not much that can change that. There's pretty much no way that Russia leaves this with a better position relative to the West.

To be clear, I'm not speaking to ethics here but purely self-interest. You could very easily argue that a stalemated semi-frozen conflict is the best the West could hope for, allowing it to bleed Russia from a distance over years.

&gt;Russia doesn't have the capacity for symmetric escalation to counter a real economic investment from the west. Even if they fully mobilised:

Of course it doesn't. It doesn't appear to have the capacity for its limited goals now. But Russian actions thus far haven't been particularly guided by strategic realities.

&gt;1. It would take months to get those units into the field.
2. Russia already has a huge issue with weapons procurement which would only get worse.
3. Russia already has a huge issue with logistics which would only get worse.

This has already been true and hasn't effected Russia's decision-making. Ultimately, what we're litigating is how Russia loses, not where they might succeed. And while full mobilization would still end in a loss, it would likely prolong the war. 

&gt;5. Even with all of that, it's still possible that Ukraine could get more soldiers into the field by fighting a total war which is something that Russia is absolutely not prepared to do.

True, but Ukraine would be facing similar challenges in effectively utilizing total war. 

&gt;4. It would be a massive domestic embarrassment to Putin and likely unpopular in Russia.

This where I think the bulk of the nuance lies. While yes, it would probably be unpopular in the context of invading Ukraine, I'm not entirely sure it would be if NATO goes all in and Russia successfully reframes this internally as a defensive war against NATO. It may be preferable for the regime to mobilize completely, reframe the war, and claim a ""defensive"" victory along roughly the same lines that existed pre-invasion.

To that point:

&gt;The game of gradual escalation is absolutely the opposite of what you want because you ""_boil the frog_"" by inviting small escalatory responses rather than a total re-evaluation of the possible long term outcomes. If you make it clear to Russia today that the long term outcome is abject defeat then the best possible outcome for them comes from sitting at the negotiating table rather than trying to strongarm Ukraine and the war ends much sooner.

I think the long term strategic picture is, or should be, fairly clear to Russian decision makers by now. The question for Russia is ultimately *how* they lose. By ""boiling the frog,"" you deny Russia a clear narrative of losing to NATO rather than Ukraine. If Russia can successfully pitch this as a NATO war, fully mobilizing sells the threat. Of course that would be disastrous for the Russian people and prolong the war, but it might make sense from the standpoint of regime survival.



&gt;Right now they clearly think that they can at least create the appearance of a limited victory (probably by occupying the Donbass and freezing the conflict) or they wouldn't still be pushing. Dispelling those illusions in absolute terms is the best outcome for all involved.

Some form of ""victory"" is likely a political necessity for the regime. Again, they might prefer to recast this as a defensive war against NATO than outright admit defeat.

To be clear, I'm not saying they would be successful in any of this, but I think it's important to factor in that Russia's best interests are not necessarily the best interests of the regime, and given its overall belligerence it is not entirely clear to me that Russia would just accept a loss and move on.",88c1fa003e67f0a0633030a979df8f58b55466bc,True,False,,,,,0,1650123815,,0,{},i4yw1au,False,t3_u46gf9,False,True,t1_i4yepp0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u46gf9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_15_2022/i4yw1au/,1650123828,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650095015.0,

Well here's the thing: you basically were.  The overarching conversation here is aid to Ukraine.  Military aid.  Tanks and bullets.  Tanks and bullets aren't going to ruin the Russian stock market, they aren't going to kick Russia out of the UN, they won't end dependence on Russian gas.  What tanks and bullets actually do is accomplish tactical objectives, such as, oh you know, holding a crucial region that both sides in the war indicate is a priority.

Like right now Ukraine is very transparently asking for aid **with the battle for Donetsk**.  If we're talking about useful aid to Ukraine, then we inherently have to talk in the context of that battle.  So yes, we are talking about tactical victories too.  

Especially since:

&gt;I.e., achieving a result that confers a strategic advantage in the overall goal of curbing the West in Russia's backyard and maintaining Ukraine as a client buffer state along Russia's border.

Ukraine's ability to hold Donetsk is going to have a huge effect both on Ukraine's viability as a state and on their leverage in peace talks, which directly feed into Ukraine's long term strategic prospects too.

If we don't remove Biden well before 2024, we will face a scenario where our ruling elites have so massacred the financial wealth of our middle class that 'one more crisis' will be all it takes in forcing communism upon us.

We are in double digit inflation now and people are losing their religion because neither Democrat nor Republican seem to realize we are onto their 'our agenda is to beat the other side and continue as normal' strategy to layer cake disaster upon disaster with seeming deliberate intent to collapse our economy.

Imagine a world in which there is no B-21.  Where sustainment for the F-35 is impossible because Lockheed is in the same position as MiG or Sukhoi in the early 1990s.  Having a high tech product  but no baseline customer to establish an economic sustainability model for continuing spares and maintenance.

Now imagine that scenario with the further condition the US Dollar is no longer the GRC.  But the RMB is.  And the United States is in the middle of a massive Civil War as the remaining founder population seeks desperately to secede from a million-per-month invasion-nation with a median age of white males of 61 years old.

All while those who so clearly despise prove their hypocrisy by the eagerness with which they seek to return us to the plantation because the average 80-85 IQ of the last half century of immigration has no way of sustaining the skilled professions, GDP or taxbase necessary to just keep the lights on.

You will stand alone.  Because America will no longer exist as the 'United States.'

That said, there is no reason to fight at the straits of Malacca.  The approaches are choked, the water is shallow.  If you have nuke boats, why TLE yourselves to such a constricted waterway apt to be rapidly filled with bottom lay tracking systems and constant overhead wake tracking when you can instead bridge distance with missiles targeted by overhead.

Even with convoying, it just isn't necessary to control any fixed point so much as hunt the spaces inbetween choke and delivery.

Also keep in mind that a torpedo actually costs more than a modern AShM, with the CBASS Mk.48 running around 3.8 million per warshot.  Vs. 1.2 million for an upgraded Blk.IIa Harpoon or 2.2 million for LRASM. 

Never mind the fact that China has something like 5 active space launch facilities and are able to launch into any orbit they please whereas the West has to go overseas.

Are you honestly going to stand up a Space Force against them?

You want security?

I would suggest you begin by politically exiling the terrorists who would COVID gulag your society into total disaffection and mistrust of any central government.

Stop importing the third world as a low function, permanent prison industry and welfare class with completely incompatible cultures and TFRs to your own.

Start having a lot of kids to get your own median age down.

Find other people than China to sell cattle and phosphates to.

Urgently develop your industry and particularly your high tech computer chip industry (when 5nm chips from Taiwan go the way of the dodo) so that info dominance and cyber safety doesn't piggy back on China's components and information networks.

You should try to get as much foreign ownership out of your economy as possible starting at the university level because not only are Confuscious Institutes poisoning the minds of your children, but they are also a backdoor to your entire military R&amp;D base and you know it.

Speaking of which, I would suggest you at least get a leg in other than Uncle Sam's bed on such things as JNAAM and Tempest and FCAS.

Do all of this because this trick with using external sanctions and outright theft to seize other country's foreign invested assets, making them unable to make their debt payment and sending them into default, is going to be something the /next/ superpower sees as very useful.

Once the massively overeased, hyperinflated dollar and a borderline retarded President is no longer pulling the levers and twisting the knobs of the global economy.  Trying to crash it to save his own job satisfaction numbers.

Stabilize, centralize, diversify.  So that you can stand alone in as many areas as possible, rather than relying on foreign sourced anything.

And if you then just /insist/ on joining an alliance hell bent on kicking The Dragon, do so with the lowest value assets you can afford to trade up with.

A Sea Tender operating Robotic FAC-M with a HALE BACON (as pseudolite) asset for remote-operator control and some kind of BAMS to target with.

The SCS is ideal for this kind of warfare for about 7 months a year.  And it would make you a useful ally to the likes of the Philippines and Thailand and Indonesia who will all be looking to standoff both Chinese maritime militia 'pirate fishing fleets' from ever more islands and stage attacks on major fleet combatants from inside their aeroballistics capabilities.  Where a 10-12 million dollar missile should set the limit of your boat+four  missiles in turn.

[],False,,Telinary,,,[],,,,text,t2_aw0ng,False,False,"&gt; For other stupid political reasons, Germany shut down its large and excellent fleet of nuclear power stations in the wake of the Japanese tsunami. That has left them completely reliant on Russian oil and gas. Stupid, but hard to fix fast.

While I think we should have run them longer for other reasons the ""the gas situation would be fine if Germany didn't shut down it's nuclear plants"" take that goes around reddit is imo a bad take and I suspect it is mostly based on that being the only thing most people on reddit know about the German Energy Sector.

I think the more likely outcome of not shutting them down is speeding up the removal of coal plants not avoiding the usage of gas. (Which would have been great, which is why I would have let them run longer, but doesn't solve the Gas problem.) Gas emits less CO2 than coal based energy which is one reason why coal is being reduced in Germany while gas use is still relatively steady. And nuclear power isn't a direct replacement for the way gas is used, because it is less flexible. 

That aside electricity is responsible for 15% of the gas use or so, most goes to industry and households. 15% is significant sure but the focus on the smallest sector as reason doesn't make much sense imo.

The error was not diversifying sources for gas, the connection with the ""Atomausstieg"" doesn't seem all that strong to me.

Side note: Exiting the use of nuclear power is a much older political process than Fukushima. In 2010 it got delayed but Fukushima in the next year lead to canceling the delay and speeding it up again.",a92630daf09060a8f21a7f826c1680fd60c870bd,True,False,,,,,0,1650117074,,0,{},i4ygvd4,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i4ybrmx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i4ygvd4/,1650117089,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650088274.0,

Russia doesn't have the capacity for symmetric escalation to counter a real economic investment from the west. Even if they fully mobilised:

1. It would take months to get those units into the field.
2. Russia already has a huge issue with weapons procurement which would only get worse.
3. Russia already has a huge issue with logistics which would only get worse.
4. It would be a massive domestic embarrassment to Putin and likely unpopular in Russia.
5. Even with all of that, it's still possible that Ukraine could get more soldiers into the field by fighting a total war which is something that Russia is absolutely not prepared to do.

The game of gradual escalation is absolutely the opposite of what you want because you ""_boil the frog_"" by inviting small escalatory responses rather than a total re-evaluation of the possible long term outcomes. If you make it clear to Russia today that the long term outcome is abject defeat then the best possible outcome for them comes from sitting at the negotiating table rather than trying to strongarm Ukraine and the war ends much sooner. The longer that Russia thinks that they can spin the war as some kind of win or that eventually the resolve of western nations will waver the more likely they are to escalate or protract and cause more needless suffering.

Of course we're not!

We squabble and bicker and flounce and argue. That's our deep unity. We're friends because we like each other, not because we have to be.

Arguing and disagreeing and making noise is our very core.

But Germany is throwing Euros into Ukraine. The United Kingdom (who left the EU because Putin told them to) are giving Ukraine weapons so advanced they haven't been operationalised by British forces yet.

Australia is flowing pretty much all our light armour vehicles to Ukraine by air.

And Western Europe is backfilling Eastern Europe as they flood Ukraine with the kit that Ukraine can use today.

Those S-300 and S-400 systems from Poland and Slovakia are being replaced by Patriot.

MiG-29s from Poland and Slovakia will be replaced by F-16s.

There are real disagreements in and between Western nations about appropriate and acceptable levels of support for Ukraine.

And that's how democracies work.

You'll note that Ukraine is asking democracies for help. That's partly because Ukraine is a democracy (or struggling to be one).

But it's also because it was the democracies that build the Patriot, the Eurofighter,  the Rafael, the F-35, the Astute submarines, the Starstreak, the Javelin, the NLAW.

Description:

&gt; China’s naval modernization, a process that has been underway in earnest for three decades, is now hitting its stride. The advent of the Type 055 cruiser firmly places the PLAN among the world’s very top naval services. This study, which draws upon a unique set of Chinese-language writings, offers the first comprehensive look at this new, large surface combatant. It reveals a ship that has a stealthy design, along with a potent and seemingly well-integrated sensor suite. With 112 VLS cells, moreover, China’s new cruiser represents a large magazine capacity increase over legacy surface combatants. Its lethality might also be augmented as new, cutting edge weaponry could later be added to the accommodating design. This vessel, therefore, provides very substantial naval capability to escort Chinese carrier groups, protect Beijing’s long sea lanes, and take Chinese naval diplomacy to an entirely new and daunting level. Even more significant perhaps, the Type 055 will markedly expand the range and firepower of the PLAN and this could substantially impact myriad potential conflict scenarios, from the Indian Ocean to the Korean Peninsula and many in between. This study of Type 055 development, moreover, does yield evidence that Chinese naval strategists are acutely aware of major dilemmas confronting the U.S. Navy surface fleet.

Basically everyone kept expecting Russia to play less poorly, and also recently they expected Russia's ""operational pause"" in the Donbas to lower equipment destruction.  I did too.

But to my shock, a lot of OSINT handles are consistently pumping out images of equipment and more importantly videos of ambushes and artillery strikes on Russian vehicles **in the Donbas** that are very recent.  So really I think Ukrainian analysis is correct - the ""operational pause"" is misleading, and actually Russian units are absolutely still putting themselves in harms way.

Maybe they want to probe the Ukrainian front.

That is also my point of confusion.  

But the pentagon is unambiguously saying ""unmanned boat"" and every other candidate in the naval inventory I can find is a prototype and thus unlikely to be gifted.

Possibility branch 1 - a completely classified and unheard of drone boat is being sent to Ukraine - very unlikely

Possibility branch 2 - it's literally just vaporware and the Pentagon is just saying they're delivering things that don't actually exist - very unlikely

Possibility branch 3 - the pentagon is indeed delivering the above system, the CUSV - odd but I can't see any other logical explanation.

Which comes back to your question - why the fuck would Ukraine need a minesweeper/submarine detector right now?  And I have that same question, and I don't know.  But here are some dumb theories I've come up with:

Theory a: The CUSV has been recently modified (without public knowledge) to  take on other roles, such as intelligence, target spotting or combat.

Theory b: the CUSV is capable of laying mines, not just disarming them, and the Ukranians want to do this

Theory c: the Ukrainians are worried about russian submarines in the black sea..  or something?

Theory d: the pentagon gave the CUSV knowing full well it wouldn't help much during the current conflict, but wanted to make the package size larger.  The Ukrainians presumably didn't look a gift horse in the mouth.

I will say throughout that entire thread the author fails to mention the TC can't control or the fire the guns on a T-72 except for the T-72B3 2011 and 2016. The B3 added a LCD for the TC linked to the Sosna-U sight and a small thumbstick to transverse the turret and elevate guns. Doing so on a earlier mod would require removing the recoil guard for the main gun and crawling into the gunner's position. Going by Oryx Russia has lost at least 152 T-72B 1989 and earlier mods, and these tanks would be nothing but targets unable to fire.

That same belief is still around today, with groups like the The Heritage Foundation promoting it.

[],False,,abloblololo,,,[],,,,text,t2_qhbwl,False,False,"&gt;What are the bottlenecks practically on this tech:
&gt;
&gt; Is it the quality of rapid, accurate targeting?

In clear weather optical targetting is very doable, and optical sensors can be linked to wider FOV sensors like radar. However, in conditions with poor visibility these weapons will likely be useless.

&gt; Is it the aiming of the laser correctly to that targeting?

Aiming is largely a solved problem, putting a laser on a target is essentially equivalent to keeping the target in the centre of a camera and we're talking about engaging relatively slow objects that fly in predictable paths with low angular velocities (because they're likely coming _at_ the ship).

&gt; Is it the amount of power going through the laser not melting it?

These kinds of laser weapons essentially work by heating up the target until it suffers a critical failure, and that is done by illuminating the target continuously. A laser operating in continuous wave mode is relatively forgiving in terms of laser power, because most of the detrimental effects scale linearly with laser power (as opposed to nonlinear effects in pulsed lasers). Most of the optics will operate in reflection, meaning that almost no laser power is absorbed and because the laser is on a honkin' ship there's a lot of cooling power available for optics that need to work in transmission. Of course there are still various challenges associated with very high power lasers, but they're not insurmountable. There are commercially available CW lasers in the ~100 kW range, which is the kind of power we're talking about for these weapon systems.

&gt; Is it the above in combination limiting ranges (I know shooting through near-sea-level atmosphere causes a lot of dissipation, even if you pulse repeatedly. 

Range is definitely limited, as you say shooting towards the horizon is significantly more challenging because the air up to about 40-50 meters above the surface of the water is significantly more turbulent. The turbulence can to some extent be corrected for in real time, but only to a limited degree. Absorption is also a concern, because the transmitted laser power goes down _exponentially_ with distance. Therefore it's critical to pick a laser wavelength that has limited atmospheric absorption, but this choice is also very much constrained by existing technology (certainly wavelengths are much easier to generate and have significantly more mature technology). As you hinted at, there's also an effect called thermal blooming, where the absorption of laser light by the atmosphere then causes strong distortions of the laser light passing through that region. 

I would say these are the biggest, and most fundamental problems (there are ""cute"" ways to get around this, for example using something called laser filamentation, but it's widely unrealistic at this point). The lack of all weather capability is another one, and finally these weapons can only engage a single target at a time making them susceptible to saturation attacks.",92649138bde328f93bac959bb4ce7e94a0be63f3,True,False,,,,,0,1650105830,,0,{},i4xz3r0,False,t3_u4nqds,False,True,t1_i4xe1hz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4nqds/us_navy_conducts_historic_test_of_new_laser/i4xz3r0/,1650105845,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650077030.0,

Blatant escalation will be seen by outside actors as threatening, and may lead to China intervening in the conflict, or Russia expanding the war, or both. The trick is to support Ukraine to win the war, while simultaneously minimizing justifications for the other side to escalate as well.

[],False,,verbmegoinghere,,,[],,,,text,t2_3amxrj0r,False,False,"Huh, have you had a look at just how much coast line Australia has.

I completely understand why the government is considering nuclear submarines.

The problem is that Australia doesn't have the thousands of engineers, physicists, technician and the massive manufacturing and processing, enriching and tritium producing gfacilities, not to make and support the ongoing maintainence and refuelling required for a nuclear submarine fleet.

The UK, EU and US can have a nuclear sector because they have spent decades and trillions in building and supporting the universities and institutions that are required. We lack the personal and institutional experience and knowledge. Let alone the facilities to either reprocess or long term storage of radioactive waste products. 

Shit we don't ven have the land suitable for civilian nuclear facilities let alone for the military. Just 2 years ago 30% of Australia's fertile coastal land burned. Just this year and last we had once in a 1000 year flooding. 

In 2011 an entire city (Brisbane) went under water in a other once in a 1000 year event.

I for one do not want a nuclear reactor to end up at the mercy of these events. Because knowing our governments refusal to create a fleet of a dozen water bombing fire fighting aircraft there is nothing they could do to stop a mega fire burning down a reactor or processing facility. 

Finally we simply do not of the economic base to underwrite let alone create this sector in the timeline outlined by the government. Maybe if the plan was over 100 years. But then again the conservatives were so corrupt and incompetent rolling out the national fibre (and MTM which ended up being decommissioned) that alone should show they cannot be trusted (not to mention their corruption with Chinese money, being in bed with paedophiles who run Hillsong and Catholic Church). 

Worse we do not have enough sailors to man|woman the submarines and surface fleet we have today. Literally we have ships tied up because we can't recruit enough, whilst the DoD isn't do fuck all to fix the chronic and systemic personnel and management issues that are causing experienced and valuable personnel to leave as soon as their contracted period is up.

Imagine we go ahead with this bullshit plan, build subs, train 18 year olds to be nuclear certified reactor operators and then when their sick of the BS leave at 26.

Without the civilian sector having even a fraction of what I've outlined there won't be any sort of work we offer to keep them in Australia.

Instead we'll lose them to the UK and US who's sectors will pay a pretty penny for these diamonds in the rough.

Don't say mine is a simplistic take when in my last two posts I described 80 years of warfare and included sources, whereas the best you did was write the reddit posting version of a bad Toby Keith song. 

Its wrong and also fucking rude.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The Russians had no chance winning against Ukraine due to their own incompetence and not having near the force projection numbers that were needed. 

I don't agree, neither do a whole lot of other highly credible analysts who aren't all ""The Russians suck lol"" because of this war. For instance, the whole reason nearly everyone with any credibility was saying the Russians were going to win the conventional war with ease was the same reason they and the US Army in particular were crapping their pants over Russia Stronk because of demonstrated Russian military capabilities, especially ground forces, for example incidents like [this](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/battle-debaltseve-hybrid-army-classic-battle-encirclement) and [this](http://www.dupuyinstitute.org/blog/2017/03/29/the-russian-artillery-strike-that-spooked-the-u-s-army/). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Once again, you seem to be very focused on anecdotal evidence

Anecdotal evidence? Do you know what that means? 

**I POSTED SOURCES** 

I even hyperlinked a fucking Rand report. I posted a list of conflicts stretching back 80 years, and you are flinging this shit at me?  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However the difference was the US kicked the door in and bombed the fuck out of the Iraqi capital in a demonstration of force and made rapid progress with their main thrusts. 

Newsflash, the Baghdad attacks mostly did shit besides the ones that hit actual C4I targets and not the ones rubbling unoccupied palaces in the Green Zone. And how is that different from the Russians ""shock and awe"" bombing and rapid armored thrusts that blew up in their faces? 

I'll tell you how: there was no major threat from the Iraqi military to stop the two Coalition axes of advances heading into their country, which is there are no large scale battles during the invasion. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians are performing a very top notch defense. While the Iraqis did one of the worst contested defenses of an invasion in modern history.  Which is a major reason why the US looked so good and the Russians look so bad. 

Don't fucking lie and say the enemy doesn't get a vote. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The strategic intelligence assessments I was talking about were invasion plans between two conventional armies.

And I listed numerous conflicts that were conventional wars. In fact the only ones I listed that weren't were Iraq insurgency, Afghan insurgency, and Vietnam, which was partly a conventional war too. Every other war I mentioned with historic examples was a conventional conflict against peer or near peer enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Once again, the Iraq invasions are the best comparisons we have, and the US military was well prepared for each invasion phase. It's absurd you think the US military is that incompetent.

Jesus Christ, you know so little about OIF its fucking insulting at this point you're trying to play the SME about it. 

Okay, for starters:  

The US wasn't well prepared, we had a leave a fucking division on ship because Turkey wouldn't let the 4th ID through their country. That was a major piece of COBRA II, having an entire division plus advance from the north would have pulled forces that could have defended Baghdad (BWT, why didn't they defend Baghdad, why didn't [this plan go into action](https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/bcf5f5d6-0001-0005-0000-000000586984_w420_r1.0294117647058822_fpx55.24_fpy44.86.jpg)?).  

I MEF was tasked to act as a mechanized maneuver element a role it had no business doing, which by its own admission from its officers it had a very tough time doing. Not because they are incompetent but because they are not equipped or trained to perform that mission set. For instance, 3rd ID on their flank who the Marines had to keep pace with, had three armored brigade combat teams of tanks and IFV, while the 1st MarDiv has three infantry regiments and one tank battalion and an LAV battalion. It would be like having the 101st do a division level amphibious assault. Remember when the first time a full bird colonel was relieved of duty mid combat over actual performance issues since the Vietnam War? I do, because it happened during the invasion, when Col Dowdy got relieved by Mattis because his regiment couldn't keep up. 

How about those pesky Fedeyeen nobody thought of? Did you know that the commanders of 3rd ID, V Corps, and Army Third Army all requesting to CENTCOM numerous times to pause their advance to Baghdad so he could deal with them to secure his rear? And do you know what happened afterwards? Rumsfeld tried to have him fired (his career was destroyed afterwards) and they didn't get the pause...I could go on and on about major problems that prove they weren't well prepared. 

And do you know how I can go on and on?

The Russians had no chance winning against Ukraine due to their own incompetence and not having near the force projection numbers that were needed.  The Russians forgot what their strength was which is overwhelming numbers and firepower advantage.  They used these advantages to great effect in their successes and failed to use these advantages in the conflicts they lost.  

Once again, you seem to be very focused on anecdotal evidence and don't take into account the force differential between US and Iraqi forces and what role that played in their demoralization.  Ukraine was in a very similar situation to Iraq pre-invasion.  They made very little preparations for a conventional conflict.  There were several officers with the propensity to capitulate without a fight.  However the difference was the US kicked the door in and bombed the fuck out of the Iraqi capital in a demonstration of force and made rapid progress with their main thrusts.  The Russians meanwhile went in half-assed, very slow, with very little show of force, suffered major setbacks early which boosted Ukrainian morale to keep fighting.  

The strategic intelligence assessments I was talking about were invasion plans between two conventional armies.  You're trying to apply that to a host of different contexts entirely which isn't relevant to this discussion. And once again, the US military would never make such a disastrous intelligence blunder under the same set of circumstances as the Russians had.  Once again, the Iraq invasions are the best comparisons we have, and the US military was well prepared for each invasion phase.

Wrong. 

The successes happened because the opposition leadership and their supporters crumbled in the face of the Soviet/Russian audaciousness. The times it didn't work is when opposition leadership and their supporters said ""Fuck it, YOLO"" and blew the Russians the fuck up. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's because they were convinced of the US's military superiority through demonstration of force. 

Wrong. 

At the very highest levels of the Iraqi high command, which Saddam ran (hence him wearing military uniforms), it was agreed on (because Saddam said so) that Bush was bluffing. So there was almost no preparation to resist the invasion, anyone who tried to bring it up was effectively committing treason, because Saddam had spoken. [source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7249/mg544af.8?seq=1)  

So when the invasion did start, that was too late to start planning and executing a defense because the US severed the C4I capabilities, they couldn't talk to one another for shit. [source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/04/01/in-shift-air-war-targets-communications-facilities/1c0dba8c-ff41-4af0-bd5a-c983b119866c/)  

There were so many truly idiot things Saddam did while simultaneously baiting America to attack him that it makes Russia's foray into Ukraine in 2022 look the Battle of France 1940. For further reading, knock yourself out: 

[Rand Study: Why the Iraqi Resistance to the Coalition Invasion Was So Weak](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG544.pdf)

&gt;All of those other examples you mentioned are irrelevant to the discussion at hand. The context of the discussion was an invasion plan that pitched two conventional armies against each other. The US is not overlooking the enemy in that situation, though they have in other situations that weren't conventional conflicts.
