The ship was being towed. Both the Pentagon and the Russians are stating that. It is most likely true as we have two independent sources confirming.   
A towing indicates it didn't roll and the hits weren't catastrophic. Otherwise it would have broken in two and sunk. There would have been no towing attempts.   
That would indicate most of the crew had a chance to escape since you wouldn't attempt towing without evacuating the crew first. 

Or we can just believe what the Ukrainians are saying and assume it sunk shortly after being hit. That would mean the Pentagon source is wrong. However they've proven to be most reliable source so far. 

If you believe the ship was being towed at one point = most crew survived.  
If you believe the ship was hit catastrophically and sunk right after = most crew perished. 

It's that simple. 

The fire was reported first and the towing second and the sinking third.

For one part it might be because our economies are so much more interconnected and optimisied. Most countries are relatively close to full employment (minus a few percent that are unavoidable due to people changing jobs and special individuial cases) and almost every military depends on international markets to some extent because weapons have gotten so complicated. 

Then there is the aspect of modern expectations in equipment and training, so perhaps these small armies really are much more effective than the large numbers of the world wars.

In the 18th century, simple militias were still serious military forces that could win wars. In the 20th centuries, there were massive conscript armies with relatively simple weapons for the rank and file and the difference to the professionals often wasn't that big. But in the 21st century it seems like a professional army battalion would just chew through a multiple as many conscripts on an even battlefield.",f79b2da6a487a7f5ef1cd73131abaf5973b432c1,True,False,,,,,0,1650145681,,0,{},i509tnn,False,t3_u53rqh,False,True,t1_i505o58,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u53rqh/precise_artillery_hit_on_a_russian_truck_southern/i509tnn/,1650145699,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650116881.0,

Because that is what you do. You are just out of arguments, repeating the same thing all over again. That's understandable you never had any. 

&gt;Calling people dumb after being called weak-minded,

playing dumb means not recognizing obvious things in conversation, that is what you are doing. Sounds pretty accurate, don't pretend you are some kind of victim.

&gt; So you’re the sole arbiter of whether anti-Russian videos are faked? Just you against the sea of people who disagree with you?

Just like everyone else here.

&gt; Or is it—like I’ve been pointing out so often—that you only care about the anti-Russian ones?

i replied to that in a previous post(s). 

&gt; Nope. Just someone who knows how to read. It’s your comment history, numbnuts. If you have a problem with how people read the things you write, write differently.

just look at yourself lol, is this your argument? ""i can read"".  ""go write differently for people to understand you"" Sorry but if you can't understand anything im saying thats not my problem. 

&gt; I get the impression you either forget the things you write as soon as you hit the comment button or you really hope people don’t bother to check your comment history.

Oh look, you are at again, no arguments just crying about ""CoMmeNT HiStoRy"" of other person claiming you are some kind of detective that uncovered some spy holy fuck how can you even recover after that? You should probably contact law enfocement agencies because of your findings in my comment history lul.

&gt; Literally, all I did was look at you deny being a Russian troll and looked at your comment history to see if you fit the pattern. That’s not being “brainwashed,” that’s fact-checking.

No, you just baselessly harrasing other person because you don't like something that that person is doing. So like many ""small minded"" people you put a label on that person because that way it's easier to ignore actual argumets. That is the definition of being branwashed.

&gt; It’s not my fault you act like a Russian troll. Again, if you don’t like being called out for that, act differently.

Why would I change my behavior again? Because some person in the the internet told me to do so? I asked about this before but you never replied.

An exception is made only for materials that are posted in the public domain by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces.  
  
Violation of the ban is punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 years.  
  
Therefore, there are not many fresh videos and photos from the Ukrainian side, more often we see official videos or videos from pro-government structures.

Their whole military doctrine (which informed their designs and logistics chains) was developed on the premise of a defensive war in the wake of them being invaded during WWII.  That's why they keep such a huge stockpile of ancient weapons and equipment, because during Nazi invasion they found themselves quickly running out of war material, and that pervasive fear of having nothing to fight back with persists to this day.  That said, their culture of production and military procurement during the Cold War was not one of seeking the highest quality products, which is good for them because they were not making them, and still aren't as we can see from the smoking wrecks now littering the Ukrainian countryside.

If Russia wants to get past these problems, they need to not only get past the cultural ""good enough"" mindset with respect to their equipment, and they need to stop spending money maintaining an absurd number of wildly outdated tanks.  They'll need to figure out what it is they want their military to be able to do, and spend the next few decades building up the capabilities to accomplish those goals.  This will necessitate new weapons and equipment designs and procurement.  The problem there is that, in the wake of this, shall we say, ""debacle"", they'll be struggling to retain whatever talent they have left that could do that design, they can't build shit anymore with all the sanctions preventing them from getting the foreign goods they'd need (seriously, look at how much foreign shit is in the drones they had) and then being able to purchase sufficient numbers of those items to be meaningful in any strategic sense will be damn near impossible given where their economy is going in the face of international sanctions.",44a775268d7df4b10aad7efa6392b1d49bfbf22a,True,False,,,,,0,1650139532,,0,{},i4zw4b4,False,t3_u4ztac,False,True,t1_i4zk6cy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4ztac/ukrainian_501st_separate_marine_battalion_atgm/i4zw4b4/,1650139545,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650110732.0,

as if fighting and causing collateral damage would have enabled us to win. You are ascribing strategic importance to tactics, which are of little to no strategic importance in a COIN. 

We lose not because we can’t blow up more buildings or kill more people, it’s because we fail to understand the cultures; because we try to build their governments, their armies and their very societies in the American image. We don’t let them solve their problems their own way. 

It’s another example of what I dealt with in Iraq: the buy in of the people.

Action: Fund, contract and build a water treatment facility for the locals.

Result: 2 SVBIEDs, 1 destroying the facility and the other hitting the local market place. 

Action 2: Mentor the locals in planning and managing the build themselves, require them to clear 25% of the supply aqueduct. 

Result 2: The locals use soft pressure and the threat of active resistance to dissuade the Anti-Iraqi Forces from any further action against the treatment facility. 

Killing in a COIN doesn’t help you win, it just keeps you from losing one more day.",034c8adc5d002ecf4b3c4e99131856076b5ed210,True,False,,,,,0,1650139226,,0,{},i4zvfdz,False,t3_u4gw7c,False,True,t1_i4zmzdy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4gw7c/situation_in_mariupol_on_the_15th_of_april/i4zvfdz/,1650139239,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650110426.0,

Maybe except ISIS - they were organized. But still not that professional. It is really not easy to be a professional SVBIED driver. I was trying to find guys with at least some experience in the field, but it is as if they all disappeared in a flash.   
The colonel in the video actually provides evidence after evidence, that the coalition in Mosul was much more like a loose collection of tribes.

Pretty similar to cruise missiles in their effect. However they are short range, far short to make it to Moscow. 

One of the old Soviet design bureaus was based in Dnipro, it still exists, is still owned by Ukraine (there’s zero chance it would have survived this long if it wasn’t) and is now known as Yuzhnoye. They made both missiles and space launch vehicles, though my understanding is that they transitioned to the latter after the collapse of the USSR. After the 2014 conflict they began to develop ballistic missiles again, but the funding situation was difficult, liquid fueled-rockets (their area of expertise) are obsolete, and solid-fuel ballistic missiles were not a Soviet speciality. It’s probably predictable that an old underfunded ex-OKB would have some trouble developing them in a timely manner. In addition to restarting production of ballistic missiles, the Ukrainians also began to develop longer range ballistic missiles. Both projects were close to completion when war broke out, but it’s believed that none of it was actually ready in time for the invasion. Then again, I once thought the same thing about the Neptune missiles. 

Giving them more ballistic missiles would be really, really difficult. We would only be allowed to give them short range missiles, and training would be nearly impossible. It would legitimately be easier help them figure out ways to complete the previous projects and produce those missiles without interference.",17b2055bb6bdc7bf7d256298f2306b0854be6322,True,False,,,,,0,1650134683,,0,{},i4zlh4b,False,t3_u4u4rr,False,True,t1_i4z19eq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4u4rr/caliber_cruise_missile_in_the_lviv_region_this/i4zlh4b/,1650134698,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650105883.0,

In this case a Radar that is able to track a small target like a missile at a range of 10 km can be reduced to ~2km range.
Large search radars, which operate on lower frequencies, generally don't suffer from the same problem nearly as much. So it is entirely possible that they were aware of the two missiles for the last 10 to 15 miles, but were not able to engage them until in range of the CIWS. Would be interesting to know if this has been modeled in DCS, considering that they have an extremel well modeled radar engine.

I do not agree, Israel has basically humiliated Syria's SAA by destroying its Russian AA equipment when and where it pleases throughout Syria using mere stand off strikes. It doesn't need Russia's permission to destroy Russian equipment and Russian allied forces in Syria, it does that already. Israel needs to smooth some things over politically for that, but it has gone too far in the other direction in outright bending the knee and submitting to Putin here.

&gt; Israel is not a staunch US ally like many think,

I disagree with this as well. It is the United States' strongest ally/partner in the region, is an ally through and through. Trying to drive a wedge between Israel and the U.S. here is not going to work. The shared and tightly coupled military/industrials interests with Israel are so strong that if not an ally to the U.S. than no country might as well be.

&gt;there's been plenty of times where it has been actively detrimental to America and NATO. Pollard is probably the standout case, along with the attack on the USS Liberty.

Occasionally, Israel makes mistakes or acts in ways that do not align with the EU and NATO. It is perfectly free to spy on the U.S., the U.S. likely spies on Israel. In some cases sending arms to Azerbaijan it may not align with the EU's stance on the security of Armenia, Israel may nibble on the edges but it has its own discrete interests it may pursue. One could argue equally the U.S. acts against Israel's strategic interests by destabilizing the entire middle east in Iraq, or signing a nuclear agreement with Iran. Or that France and Germany have their own strategic interests and don't have Israel's interests at heart.",63cde65a70380a947f22f176e498eb47d1571cc7,True,False,,,,,0,1650133270,,0,{},i4ziac2,False,t3_u4kjec,False,True,t1_i4zerwl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4kjec/azerbaijani_spike_nlos_taking_out_armenian/i4ziac2/,1650133286,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650104470.0,

Russian security services, including intelligence and the FSB, are actively working with international drug cartels and terrorist groups such as FARC-ELN, Hamas or the Sinaloa cartel. Criminal-terrorist ties in Cuba became intermediaries in establishing such relations that Russia could gradually renew and strengthen by writing off debts to Cuba, and its involvement in the activities of cartels and far-left forces. This very fact is proved by the recent scandal related to 400 kg of cocaine found on the territory of the school at the Embassy of Russia in Argentina. The Russian Foreign Ministry tried to present the incident as part of anti-drug traffic activity, however, the cocaine was transported to Russia by plane of the FSB director.

Yes.  I am doing that.

Calling people dumb after being called weak-minded, eh?  Just gonna…keep doing the thing you were called out on?

Nope.  Just someone who knows how to read.  It’s *your* comment history, numbnuts.  If you have a problem with how people read the things you write, write differently.

Literally, all I did was look at you deny being a Russian troll and looked at your comment history to see if you fit the pattern.  That’s not being “brainwashed,” that’s fact-checking.

That is complete BS. If the cause for the fighting is articulated properly and a worthy justification even conscripts can have high morale. Such was the case in WW2 with the American army where almost all the soldiers were enthusiastic about going. 

In this conflict the Ukrainian morale is much higher than the Russia one. Ukraine is defending its land and sovereignty. Russia is engaged in a war of aggression based on lies. Many Russian soldiers were even told it was a training exercise. Low food, low supplies, etc. 

The mobilization in Donetsk is even worse. The entire place is a Soviet style police state. The “Donetsk republic” identity is a completely artificial one.

Its hard to describe what it is like in these places, but they're in essence absolute fortresses. Everything is overbuilt to take the incredible punishment of making and moving steel around. A lot of the ground and below ground structures will need aerial bombs to blast through, artillery won't do more then peel off the thin steel sheeting walls or open up some vessels and tanks.

In particular the production lines and subterranean levels are what makes it daunting. The production lines have all kinds of maintenance access points to get inside machinery, and basements to service parts of the lines you can't access from above. Lots of underground hydraulic basements, often with tunnels linking them. The roof's above these basements are generally thick cement, able to have 60,000lb steel coils sitting on top of it with no risk of falling through. Underground tunnels connecting steam and electrical systems, substation basements, basements housing water or acid tanks, elevator shafts etc.

It is not just that these exist, it is that an attacker has no idea of where they are. It took me months of working at my mill to gain a basic understanding of its layout both above and below ground. Any attacker going into these mills are gonna be at an incredible disadvantage, there will be hundreds of directions they can be shot at from, and if they try to go into the basements to flush out defenders they'll have no idea what they are getting into or where they will be shot from. If the defenders have a good read of the facility, they'll be able to use all the various access tunnels to move around the facility at will, to hit the attackers from behind and such.

Compared to other things like cruise missiles and fighter jets, stuff like JDAM/Paveway II is very cheap. Wikipedia says Russia was using KAB-1500 as early as 2000 in Chechnya. It's highly improbable they don't have several thousand of similar weapons in stockpile. Granted they don't rely on them as much as West does, but they still have at least as many of them as the missiles they've fired by now.

Greatest obstacle to using KAB-250/500/1500 is that Ukrainian air defense is still very much operational so Russia fighters can't fly too deep into Ukrainian territory or have to fly very low. Both of those make PGMs meaningless - you need to above (or within say 15km) of the target to release them and if you're flying low there is no point in using guided munitions instead simply dropping a bunch of unguided ones.",6015ab61b382239adf07deca47dafc00e7addc68,True,False,,,,,0,1650118180,,0,{},i4yj4bx,False,t3_u4u4rr,False,True,t1_i4xzjx5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4u4rr/caliber_cruise_missile_in_the_lviv_region_this/i4yj4bx/,1650118195,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650089380.0,

&gt; Nah, obvious fakes are obvious and a lot of them are from AFU

I can point to the dozens or hundreds of pro-Russian fakes, but my point is you don't argue *those* are fakes.  Only the anti-Russian ones.

It's *almost* as if you only care about attacking anti-Russian posts and comments.  You know, like a Russian troll might do.

&gt; you want me to change my behavior because you want that?

No.  I'm telling you if you don't like being called out as a Russian troll, you should stop acting like one.  Again, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably not a zebra.

&gt; you are literally saying this in every ~~post~~ [comment] of yours

Because you keep denying it when *your own comment history* betrays the truth of the matter.

you want me to change my behaviour because you want that? what do you think chances that this is going to happen? Why would i change something in my behaviour on this sub? Why would i stop expressing by doubts about videos that i think have been staged?

Spike SR - Nearest analogue is the French Eryx

Spike MR - Nearest analogue is Javelin

Spike LR - Nearest analogue is MMP

Spike LRII - Nearest analogue is MMP

Spike ER - Nearest analogue is Hellfire

Spike NLOS - Nearest analogue are the Japanese Type 96, conceptually similar to the US EFOGM programme. The Serbian ALAS, European Polyphem and US NLOS XM501 were similar but with greater range.

Its important to note that the Spike NLOS (as seen in the above video) is very expensive (c$210,000 per round), so much so that sales were slow to non-existent for a long time. The numbers produced are a lot smaller than other Spike variants, sales tend to be much smaller in volume. The users are listed below, with a rough idea on numbers (some since used in training or combat):

**Israel** \- Unknown number, definitely in the high hundreds, possibly low thousands.

**Azerbaijan** \- Bought 240 missiles but a ***lot*** used in NGK. No idea on current numbers, they will probably restock...

**Phillipines** \- Used on their 2 x Wildcat Helicopters so likely to be a very, very small buy.

**South Korea** \- c60 missiles for Wildcat Helicopters and vehicles to target NK artillery shelling islands and FAC's.

**United States** \- Small number for testing, order for around 220 missiles for US Army AH-64 and USMC testing in 2021.

**United Kingdom** \- 600 missiles bought for Afghan and Iraq, at least 200 used in combat and training. Unclear if it has a long term future. Likely to be replaced by the BGOAA requirement.

Spike NLOS was around for a very long time, it wasn't until the UK funded a production restart in the mid 2000's for its own needs that it started to get real attention. As you can see from the above its a bit of a niche weapon to say the least, there might be a few other users in due course..

**Greece** \- Being purchased for their AH-64A, likely to be low hundreds of missiles at most, probably less.

2 other nations have sometimes been said to have NLOS, but its unlikely..

Slovakia - c100 Possible, but probably Spike LR2 (reporting differs between sources)

To be fair BP were robning them, they didnt need to disclose how much oil they pumped in a year and payed two times by building a swimming pool in Tehran, for millions worth of oil. So he tend to sympathize we the only anti british option you had at the time, short of being a communist, an Austrian painter. As you might imagine by 1944 Britian, Soviets and US werent happy with that and first occupied (mainly Britian and Soviets) Iran and they put he son on the throne. The last shah was bit of violent man, even in his young years and got dethroned after the war. In short lived democratic Iran Moshadeq came to power and wanted that Iran could use its oil wealth to prosper and denounced BP contract as nothing else than theft. He nationalized Iranian oil installation, so the British tried organise military coup, which failed. Trying once more they went to get support from the US and a young CIA. The US government was initialy opposing of coup as they saw it what is was, a neo imperialist attempt at keeping BP in power, yet the british managed convince the US that Moshadeq might be a staunched democrat but he is old and after he dies communist might take over. Which was unrealistic, as after the Soviet occupation communist lost popularity. Well the infamous coup of 1953 happend and shah was back in power and became a key client of western arms to uphold his power and form a bolwork against the Soviet. 


Fun fact the Challanger I was initially a custom tank developed for the Iranian army. Production for a massive production run started in 1978. As you can imagine UK government canncelled the contract after the revolution, but given up the contract would mean thousands of workers losing thier job and elections were around the corner. As MBT-80 program was still going on, UK government had the great idea of scrapping MBT-80, customizing the Iranian tank as much as possible to fit british army's demands and adding some modern equipment, creating Challanger I. Problem was the Iranian tank was in reality a Chieftan 1.5, making Challanger I a bit outdated from the start, that is why Challanger II came so quick after it and why Challanger III is now in development.

*[laughs]*  Considering you said you didn't know how you got outside of combatfootage earlier, you're admitting you've had to learn a bit in just the past few comments.  Learn anything else, like how to not be so obvious of a Russian troll?

&gt; because there is no point of posting thing about things you don't care about?

Think about what you just said, there: you didn't care about much of anything until the start of the war in Ukraine, where suddenly you started going after anything you think puts Russia in a bad light.  So, if you *only post about things you care about*, what does that say about *you?*

And you're offended when people (correctly) call you a Russian troll?

&gt; look at you, you are only seeing what you want to see

If by ""what you want to see"" you mean ""my entire post history for the past six months,"" then yes: my whole point is you went from seldom posting to not posting anything for a few months to suddenly seemingly making it your life's work to debunk anti-Russian posts and comments.

Your behavior matches that of Russian trolls.  If that's not how you want to be perceived, there's a simple solution to that.

&gt; you started this yourself with...blaming me for shilling

Again, someone else accused you of shilling for Russia, you said she was full of shit, and out of curiosity I decided to look at your comment history to see who was right.  The fact that you're so *obviously* filling the role of a Russian troll is just funny--as is your continuing claims to the contrary.

Again, if you don't want to be seen as a Russian troll, stop acting like one.",34008d0d45627577fb0f90523bac9839ef727b6d,True,False,,,,,0,1650110948,,0,{},i4y5z25,False,t3_u45yea,False,True,t1_i4xzhh2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u45yea/the_ukrainian_border_guards_hit_a_russian_vehicle/i4y5z25/,1650110964,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650082148.0,

A perpetually devastated Ukraine is also a security threat to the EU - it would become a hotbed of criminality and full of people disillusioned with the EU.

4041,[],False,,dropbbbear,,,[],,,,text,t2_4guzp50v,False,False,"&gt; Just because Ukraine didn’t roll over and die in the first week, the entire world thinks they’re winning. 

In the north, Ukraine has *clearly won* against Russia's massive force buildup of tanks, troops and artillery, inflicting huge casualties and vehicle destruction. Any Russian troops/equipment that escaped can now move to the east after some time, but the same goes for the Ukrainian troops.

In the southwest, Ukraine has destroyed two Russian troop transport ships *and their flagship* and pushed the Russians back on land near Mykolaiv, making capture of Odessa impossible (allowing reallocation of resources) and recapturing small amounts of territory.

In the southeast, Russia still controls large areas but Ukraine has made small gains near Volnovkha.

In the east, Russia still controls large areas but it appears to be a stalemate for the time being, with both sides making only small equivalent gains in the last few days.

In terms of ability to wage war long term, the massive loss of Russian military vehicles in many cases cannot be replaced due to lack of domestic manufacturing and an over-reliance on old Soviet gear and European supply; [while Ukraine's aid from NATO countries is only ramping up further in the form of drones, armoured vehicles, general financial aid, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) So a stalemate in the east benefits the Ukrainian side.

Overall, though it's hard to say either way, it looks like Ukraine is very capable of eventually winning, as the US government has come out and said.

&gt;but Russia has an endless stream of fresh troops they will be cycling to the front

Which ""endless stream""... the reserves/conscripts which Putin *personally promised on national TV* that they wouldn't be using? It's not out of the realm of possibility, but that would be immensely politically damaging. This isn't a fight for Russia's survival, and Putin has insisted this is neither a war nor an invasion but a ""special operation"", which makes it very hard to sell general mobilization. 

Ukraine, on the other hand, already has successfully mobilized its entire male population aged 18-60 in defense of the homeland and began training. This is about 12 million men. They are actually turning back people now. To do the same, Russia would need to conscript, train, and equip *1/3 of all eligible age men in their country.* Good luck hiding that, or making it popular. 

Russia has already used all the troops it can use without risking creating dissent at home (like in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan), which is why they're now forcibly conscripting Donbas residents and hiring mercenaries from North Africa.",102a9aed781234bafcebbf49b264aba562fcb3f9,True,False,,,,,0,1650099667,,0,{},i4xryjc,False,t3_u4nk11,False,True,t1_i4xog9h,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4nk11/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41622/i4xryjc/,1650099680,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650070867.0,

All the polling stations in the downtown area were closed. Officials said 426 out of 2,430 polling stations opened in the region, still largely controlled by armed militias. Some shops and cafes were closed, and many ATMs had run out of cash.  
  
In a video message, Pavel Gubarev, one of the pro-Russia militant movement's leaders, said the eastern region didn't participate because residents of Donbas already made their choice when they voted in a May 11 referendum for independence from Ukraine.

Ukraine didn't go nuts and ban the Russian language. They renamed public areas/streets for Ukranian figures/icons that were previously named for Lenin and other Soviets, made Ukrainian the official language in schools (although you can take Russian as a second language the way you can take French or German), and most controversially made it so that something like 80% of movies, theatre, radio on a certain station had to be broadcast in Ukrainian (or certain ethnic language in respect to Greek/Tartar minorities, but not Russian).  That said, government forms are still available in Russian and you're not prevented from speaking it on the street or with family.

Yeah bullshit? I assume you're referring to them providing self-defense aid to Ukraine, which wouldn't have happened if not for the globally condemned invasion Russia started. Did NATO literally put a gun to Putin's head and tell him ""INVADE UKRAINE RIGHT NOW OR ELSE"" -?

Or perhaps you're referring to Ukraine trying to join NATO on Russia's border. This is stupid too as Ukraine wouldn't have been able to get into NATO anyway due to an ongoing conflict; Russia already had multiple NATO states on its border before Ukraine applied to join; and in theory, having NATO states and even weapons on Russia's border should not be an actual threat to it anyway due to nuclear deterrent. The only reason Ukraine asked to join NATO in the first place (they don't send out invites) was exactly to protect itself from what's happening now: Russia making up a pretext to invade them.

That's a pretty intuitive thing, but it only became a conscious factor in tank design after WWII, when people knew what worked and what didn't regarding tanks, so they had time to set about refining vehicle designs. The west had really nice infrastructure after the war, so it wasn't a big priority on the FRG side of the inner German border, but the Soviets had a very large country full of weight-limited bridges to deal with, so saving every ton by shrinking the tanks (at the cost of crew comfort!) was something they thought worthwhile. You can see this easily if you compare T-55 to Centurion or M48.

The ultimate evolution of this line of thinking was T-64, which used every volume-saving trick that the KMDB engineers could think of to cram the world's heaviest armor and most powerful gun into a package that only weighed 38 tons- no small feat when the M60A1 and Chieftian weighed 48 and 54 tons, respectively, despite having less powerful main armaments and much less effective armor. 

One of those volume-saving tricks was a clever autoloader that took up much less space than a manual loader's position while still allowing for the use of a very powerful gun. It accomplished this in part by splitting the round in two, allowing a fairly large ammunition rack to take up much less space than it would in a unitary-projectile tank. Interestingly enough, the west also adopted this solution when NATO was looking at 140mm guns during the 1980s- the combined projectile assembly was so huge that even lenient NATO weight limits required two-part projectiles. 

For most of the Cold War, there was no performance difference between a one-piece shell and a two-piece shell, which made it even more attractive, but during the 1980s, it became apparent that the longer a KE penetrator was, the better it performed against enemy armor. This was a real problem for the Soviets, because KE penetrator length in those two-piece shells was much more limited than KE penetrator length in a one-piece shell- if the shell doesn't need to be split in two, you can simply extend the penetrator back into the casing, but if it does, you're stuck with the ammo rack-limited length of one half of the shell. The Russians have been trying to square that circle ever since, but only T-14 has racks capable of taking longer penetrators than the sort the Soviets started manufacturing in the late '80s.",7edbd52a73137c8e714f660148ad2ecd1b95f94e,True,False,,,,,0,1650089648,,0,{},i4xfu1p,False,t3_u4nk11,False,True,t1_i4x6u8r,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4nk11/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_41622/i4xfu1p/,1650089662,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650060848.0,

Additional Protocol I defines a mercenary as a person who:  
a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;  
b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;  
c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;  
d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;  
e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and  
f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.

Just on the virtue of taking his oath in the UA marines he would be excepted by (e) which only includes the Blackwater/Wagner Groups of the world. From what I've read of his tweets/interviews, A, C, and potentially D don't apply either.  


That said, Putin seems to have revoked Russia's affirmation of Protocol I in 2019, and Russia's own definition as I said above doesn't have that test.

Everything I've read about his involvement in Syria is similar in that he went to fight ISIS, not because the Peshmerga paid better than whatever he made back home.

Fallujah was the Iraqi equivalent to a a ghetto mixed with a Bible/Rust Belt redneck town where people survive on meth. Rough town in the best of times, anti-Coalition in this particular time, and revved up from the nascent sectarian civil war that was getting started (their sect was opposed to the sect that controlled the cops and the army).

Fallujah was a base for AQ to manufacture IEDs, and a springboard to deploy said IEDs onto the nearby freeway and attack civilian, government, and coalition traffic. They were already under light occupation before the battle, but things kicked off when some american mercenaries took a wrong turn into a bad part of town and got themselves lynched publicly, and on camera for the world to see.

So we went in there to take the city block by block, find all the ammo caches, kill AQ fighters, and secure the joint so they they couldn't fuck with nobody no more.

AQ, propped up by a lot of willing locals, fought back and made every step forward a fucking headache.

This article highlights a pretty sharp increase in the use of ghost guns in crime between 2020, 2021 and YTD. They have a lot of city-specific numbers, but also cite the feds w\\ national stats:

Difference was, at that time we had enough gas on our own to satisfy our needs. But as demand grew we needed more. Also, consider, Austria is a landlocked country. So, for us pipelines are the only option anyway.

Also, we actually tried to build an alternative pipeline via turkey to get our gas from the east instead of Russia. When I was in school our teachers praised that project and Austria was leading in it. But, it got cancelled in 2013. Not by us, but by the middle eastern part in it. Alternatively they built a smaller pipeline to Italy. My personal opinion is that this happened due to diplomatic pressure from Russia towards the middle eastern countries. Especially towards Turkey. This happened also in 2013, so the war in Syria was already raging which lead to a Russian intervention there shortly afterwards. For me, this war sealed the deal on not building that pipeline...which then lead to the situation that we are now in.

These secular ethno-nationalist groups fight against Pakistan in Pakistan's part of balochistan, while salafist-jihadists like Jaish Al Adl fight against Iran in Iran's part of balochistan, and these Iranian &amp; Pakistani movements are not linked although somewhat similar goal. 

Focusing specifically on the Pakistani movements, they say that the state of Pakistan isn't investing in their area but the money from resources in their area is spent by the dominant province of Pakistan (punjab) on itself instead of the province where it came from. They say that economic marginalization along with physically repression by the intelligence service ISI &amp; its proxies give Baloch people of Pakistani balochistan a legit reason to separate. 

They have committed ethnic displacements of Punjabi workers from balochistan, they have committed attacks against Pashtuns who have moved to Baloch's part of Balochistan (North east balochistan is indigenous Pashtun land &amp; BLA doesn't do displacement attacks there, but some Pashtuns move to Baloch areas to work in the mines there, these ppl get attacked by displacement death squads of BLA). They have committed VBIED &amp; SVBIED attacks against Chinese interests, such as Chinese convoys carrying Chinese workers, resulting in deaths of Chinese &amp; civilians who got caught up. Have also done VBIED attacks against Baloch politicians (sell-outs hahah) who are against Separatism, resulting in against both civilian and non civilian deaths. 

They do not hold land, they have a knack for ambushes though, and the Frontier Corps they fight against are poorly armed thus making it easy to kill them. They've even done attacks against the much stronger Pakistan Army in Balochistan, such as an attack that killed 9 soldiers, and a tri-attack (non-existant word but bear with me here) on 3 bases in Feb or March utilizing SVBIEDs + night vision + thermal scopes mounted on M16s that BLA claims killed 100+ soldiers, while Pakistan claims only 9-13 people died (both of these numbers are probably lies and the truth is probably in the middle). There were 20-30 BLA special forces involved in this attack.

There is a lot of support in Pakistani Balochistan for separation. This is a fact Pakistani nationalist trolls will deny but people who are in the know, know its a fact.

If you also consider how Istanbul projected power for last couple centruies, a powerful Turkey with good economy could've done the same and lessen the power and influence of EU.

Turkish Cypriots loved it when Turkey came to secure them from a genocide in the making. After 50 years, the next-generations do not like the disadvantaged position of Turkey as the time passed and individualism become more of a thing. Now you're connected to IG, tiktok etc and see all the wealth, comfort of your European friends so you would rather ask for that than being noble, or righteous. So many young Turkish Cypriots would like to live under UK or EU-member Greek Cyprus and get the oppurtunities.

In terms of reel-politics Turkey and Northern Cyprus project going worse and worse every year. That is the reason EU or Cyprus is not willing to push for a win-win solution.

To answer your question of why the US invaded Afghanistan: It was to remove Al-Qaeda from Afghanistan following 9/11 and to remove support by the Taliban for AQ. The Doha Agreement was between the Trump administration and the Taliban: that the US would withdraw and that the Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven or allow international terrorism to be launched from Afghanistan in exchange. 

The Taliban got junk from Kandahar. You're probably referencing:

But:

*The imagery from the airport in Kabul also offers some insight into how all of these aircraft were ""demilitarized."" Engine cowlings and access panels are seen open on many planes and helicopters, indicating that certain parts were removed or destroyed. An area on the ground underneath the engine of one of the A-29s is heavily stained with lubricant, further suggesting action was taken to disable its PT6 turboprop engine.* 

*Windows on various helicopters are smashed, as are the gauges in some of the cockpits, while deliberate holes have been cut in the main cabin doors of the Black Hawks. The C-130H is seen now sitting at angle, wing down, with its left main undercarriage now apparently damaged and one of its props is feathered.*

*The U.S. military has said that all 73 of the aircraft that McKenzie mentioned are now permanently disabled. ""They can look all they want but they can't fly them,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told CNN this morning.*   
  
*""Those aircraft will never fly again when we left,"" General McKenzie had said yesterday. ""They'll never be able to be operated by anyone. Most of them were non-mission capable, to begin with, but certainly they'll never be able to be flown again.""*  
  
*McKenzie's point about at least some of the aircraft being unusable to begin is supported by some of the imagery that is now available. One picture notably shows a Cessna 208 aircraft sitting on its tail with no engine and no nose gear, and with the word ""SLUDGE"" spray-painted on the side, a state that is very different from that of the other Caravans and AC-208s.*",2c855ae2fdb26cd392bdb90ced9926030f772e9c,True,False,,,,,0,1650073677,,0,{},i4wo4ht,False,t3_u473sg,False,True,t1_i4vujlk,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u473sg/separatist_artillery_chases_two_ukrainian/i4wo4ht/,1650073689,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650044877.0,True

Vietnam- closer, but the US didn't engage with the NVA on their own turf aside from aerial combat. The war was lost to VC insurgents and public sentiment and morale at home being against the war.


Korea- even closer. Stalemate to this day

WW2 is the closest we've come to attacking a comparably armed foe on their home turf and by the time we got involved in that directly, they already were being beaten back in the East and N. Africa.


Russia attacked a foe with similar numbers of mobilized manpower, virtually the same exact equipment Russia has- in many cases the same exact equipment, and with great morale due to them defending their national integrity on their own turf against an invading army composed mostly of conscripts and volunteers who were only told they were going in after they already crossed the border.",67d2fe0e7a6fdd64359ca2cb7c19bc84eef37a25,True,False,,,,,0,1650068897,,0,{},i4webqe,False,t3_u4gw7c,False,True,t1_i4w5rsz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/u4gw7c/situation_in_mariupol_on_the_15th_of_april/i4webqe/,1650068913,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1650040097.0,
