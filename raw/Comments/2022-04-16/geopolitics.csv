[],False,,TypingMonkey59,,,,,,"The russians say they don't want to engage in urban awarfare because it brings too many casualties. Mariupol has been the only real exception so far.

As for ""shame"", it depends on how many fighters are taking part on each side in Mariupol.

If [The Economist](https://web.archive.org/web/20220324031525/https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/21/hundreds-of-thousands-face-catastrophe-in-mariupol) is correct then there are 14k Russian troops and 3.5k Ukrainian troops, making it a 4:1 ratio. Judging by recent progress, it seems likely to me that the city will be fully captured by the end of the month, but even if it doesn't, it will certainly not hold out to the end of May; let's split the difference and say it will be captured by 2.5 months since the Russians started sieging it.

Assuming these numbers are roughly accurate, we can compare them to other successful sieges to see how it compares. I'm no military expert, but two recent examples that came to mind were the battles at Raqqa and Mosul. The former, from what I'm seeing had anywhere beterrn a 2:1 and a 5:1 ratio based on troop estimates, or about a 3:1 ratio on average, and took 4 months and 11 days to complete. The latter had a roughly 10:1 ratio and took a whopping 9 months to finish. A bit more research also reveals the battle of Baghuz Fawqani, where the ratio was a little over 3:1 and took 1.5 months to finish.

Another notable point of comparison is the size of all these cities. Mariupol had a population of around 431k, Raqqa has a population of around 531k, Mosul of 3.7M, and Baghuz Fawqani had around 10k as of 2004. These numbers roughly correspond to how long each of these battles took, so that probably has to be kept in mind too.

Going by all this, the Russian siege of Mariupol seems to be about average as far as successful sieges go, though we might get a better picture if more examples are given.",55f7415d09699b854fcf74b096d2cb36fa2e2e44,True,False,,,,,0,1650118406,,0,{},i4yjl7j,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i4wnewi,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i4yjl7j/,1650118420,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650089606.0,[],text,t2_q2rnh4c,False,False

I think in the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, the realist faction in the Biden administration has exerted quite a lot influence, because the US has not been this timid in decades, letting France and Germany try to appease Putin once again.

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,,,,"I think it is worth mentioning that despite being officially Sunni, Turkey's Muslims have been quite heterogenous in terms of actual practice. Before Ataturk cracked down on religious observations, Turkey was host to many Sufi orders. Now Sufism is not really a separate denomination, but does incorporate beliefs that run counter to more mainstream sensabilities like ecstatic contemplation and pantheistic worldview. More notable groups like the Bektashi order incorporated folk Balkan practices. Eastern Anatolia was also formerly inhabited by tribes of Shia Turkmen, who formed a shared cultural community with their fellow Turks in Iran and Azerbaijan. Other non-standard faiths like Alevism have also survived. In short, while Turkey may seem quite homogenous from afar, a closer look reveals a more diverse set of coexisting faiths. 

Turkey's public is also not as  strongly sectarianised as one would believe (in fact I do not see overt hostility as a default position for most Muslims. I find that its usually the radical preachers that keep spoiling the broth). Decades of state-supported campaigns have de-emphasised affiliation to Sunnism as a defining trait of Turkishness, instead drumming up perceived genealogical ties to older communities, like the narratives on Hittites and Turan.  As such, as is common in this day and age, the Turkish are likely to see themselves as genetically Turkish first, religiously Sunni second. With ethnic identity at the forefront it is therefore the case that they welcome the similarly Turkic Azeris, especially with the circulating rhetoric that Azeris are just off-brand Turkish anyway. On the other side Azerbaijan's religious establishment was gutted by decades of Soviet policy towards secularisation, and even today the community remains highly irreligious. Hence the Turkish-Azeri relationship was possible because of both countries focusing on a corporeal ethnic identity rather than a more abstract religious affinity (which in any case has been sorely lacking since the fall of the Ottomans).",2e43826ef0f9ea0503e5509bcd94d7d27e6dfec4,True,False,,,,,0,1650093635,,0,{},i4xkwwp,False,t3_t90bmh,False,True,t1_hzu6nbo,/r/geopolitics/comments/t90bmh/russian_policy_concerning_azerbaijanarmenia/i4xkwwp/,1650093651,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650064835.0,[],text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False

Now, I'm not going to haard a guess at what really happened tot he ship, but if you think Russia is refusing to admit that the Moskva was sunk by the Ukrainians because they don't want to look weak, you have to explain why they would then make up Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil in order to justify their retaliation, when such attacks would make them look just as weak as the sinking of their ship.

Also it is a very strategic location, and even having it just as a port allows it to be easier used for other purposes such as helping fishing vessels.
