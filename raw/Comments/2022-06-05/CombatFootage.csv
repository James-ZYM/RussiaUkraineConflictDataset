Just that a specific western country preserved their legacy as eastern hordes burned all of Europe's libraries, sending it to the dark ages. Those that benefited from that preservation enjoy massive advantages in science and acedemia over those that didn't. That's really the essence of why westernization = modernization. 

&gt; What about Arabic and Asian mathematics? Your numbers alone are a mix of Indian and Arabic.

And both India and the Arabic world were only modernized through Russian and Western influence. They haven't been a significant world power since world war one, what's your point?

&gt; Some of the best scientists, mathematicians, engineers and doctors in the world are African, Asian, Brazilian and Russian.

Right, because 99 percent of the world is some sort of Asian, African, South American, or Eastern European. And the vast majority of them are educated in America. That's because the free flow of ideas is an important western concept, there's no problem with this. The only advantage Russian medicine could have over western medicine is that they aren't restricted by those pesky regulations as much. 

&gt; Maybe they should've focused more on developing their government.

That's the eastern mindset at play. Westerners focused on developing education and technology and the rest followed. 

&gt; But Europe is by no means the perfect measure of success and freedom anymore. That's a blatant European bias. 

It never was the perfect measure of anything. They're just the best example.

Everyone misses the 'good ol days' but we don't have the heart to tell them it sucked back then as much as if not more than it does now.

You're putting words in my mouth; when did I say that Ukrainian air defense was made nonfunctional? Btw Oryx also has a list of destroyed radars, feel free to take a look. 

As for the destroyed bases, [Ukrainian pilots themselves]{https://coffeeordie.com/ukrainian-mig-29-pilot-interview/} say that they are operating from austere airstrips:

&gt;The Ukrainian pilots and their ground crews now operate in bare-bones conditions, living in ad hoc, secret bases established after the war began — their families don’t know where they’re located, and communication between units is kept at a minimum. Even so, Ukrainian pilots are never able to fully escape the threat of Russian missile strikes and airstrikes, which have spared no corner of Ukraine’s territory.

&gt; For checking pictures look Oryx when same S-300 isn't counted 19 times.

Not sure what this means or what your claim is.

&gt; I feel like you believe Russian briefings where they claimed total annihilation of UA airdefence and airforce immediately and claimed more planes shot down that Ukraine had total.

This never happened? I know you can't show me anything that says this. And I never said anything about Russian briefings, nor did I cite them??

""The Ukrainian side rejected these proposals,"" R. Bessmertny told the agency on Wednesday evening.  
  
He confirmed that the representatives of the ""DPR"" wanted the ""DPR"" quota in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to be fixed at the constitutional level, to have the right to approve all adopted laws and the right to veto decisions in the field of foreign policy.

This claim was contested by DNR who says that he's lying. So who knows.

Came across this as well while reading, Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov interviewing a Russian diplomat:

&gt;Solovyov: I have the impression that the Minsk agreements, if they are implemented in the logic that Moscow puts into them, are not a package, but an explosive package that will blow up Ukraine from the inside if the so-called republics return to its composition on these terms. They will be a state within a state that has a special relationship with Russia and veto power over a set of key issues. In general, they can turn into an alternative center of influence on decision-making to Kyiv.  
  
Diplomat: Is that what the Russians say?  
  
Solovyov: This is my view of the situation, based on observation, among other things, of what happened at the last summit in the Normandy format. That's why I started the conversation with the question: is it possible in principle to implement the Minsk agreements?  
  
Diplomat: If the goal is exactly as you say, Ukraine resists this.

Many analysts expected huge losses at the onset. When you look at individual actions where Russian equipment went against Western-made stuff, there was a spectacularly one-sided result. As I mentioned in my subsequent post, battle of 73 Easting, and the initial air offensive are good examples where Soviet Equipment failing miserably despite possessing large enough forces to counter the western equivalents they engaged.

The Yom Kippur war was massive onslaught by two much larger forces against an Israeli state that was not mobilized. They initially possessed a huge numerical superiority in troops, equipment, and the element of surprise. They also, arguably had a technological advantage because they had some much newer Soviet equipment initially than Israel possessed in equivalent western technology.  What was the result?  A huge, disproportionate series of documented losses despite all their advantages. 4-5 to 1 losses in tanks by the end of the war.  In air battles like Ofira, just two Israeli Phantoms chased off 28 Egyptian planes and shot down seven, incurring no losses of their own. 

Israel, as a much small state suffered huge losses, but they inflicted much higher ones on Syria and Egypt.  If anything, it helps prove my point.  Older western equipment, in the hands of a small state, vastly outperformed the newest and best Soviet equipment despite almost every advantage (numbers, surprise,  battlefield, etc..) being gifted to the enemy.  

Israel had to be resupplied, but they also didn't get those supplies to the lines before the war was over.  Also, because their tanks had better survivability they were able to get tankers back into action once resupplied.

&gt;hadn't been able to do SEAD and DEAD.

There are enough pictures of burned out S-300 launchers and radars to disprove this idea.

&gt;Number of RU sorties is inflated by the fact that many of them are long range missile strikes.

""Inflated"" lmao. A sortie is a sortie, what changes between launching a precision munition and a dumb bomb?

&gt;S-300 are mobile

Majority of Ukrainian arsenal is S-300PT, which has protracted setup and teardown times of around 30 minutes. This was the type destroyed in Kharkov.

&gt;On ground only near Kharkiv they destroyed a battery as major success.

It's not verified but it's likely many of the warehouses and bases hit in the initial volley still housed their S-300 launchers. What we know for sure is that the radars of the batteries active on the night of Feb 23 were destroyed, which is essentially the destruction of an entire battery.

&gt;After initial strike destroying Ukrainian air defence without ground attacks was impossible for Russia

What does ground attack mean for you? If you mean traditional ARM SEAD missions from aircraft, it's true that they aren't successful, but this was proven in Yugoslavia during the 90s. S-300 has been taken out by cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and cluster munitions since the initial strike.

&gt;Russia still has air superiority but it's not a won air war. And now number of successful UA sorties is growing.

This is delusional. If anything the UAF sorties are decreasing, aside from the two instances in which they managed to surge.

To me, Germany's biggest problem is their communications, not necessarily the aide.  Canada, my own country, has similar issues with chronic underfunding of our military and was left with very little in the way of heavy equipment to offer Ukraine.  Whereas Canada has succeeded and Germany failed was with failing to provide consistent communication (Are we supplying weapons?  Yes! Just not heavy weapons. No, we're supplying heavy weapons too!.  Wait, we have no heavy weapons.  No, youcan't ahve THOSE heavy weapons.  No we're doing the ring system!.  The Weapons will be coming immediately.  No, wait, they'll be there in September!)

Russia still has air superiority but it's not a won air war. And now number of successful UA sorties is growing.

One interesting fact - Ukraine was warned about incoming rocket attack and S-300 are mobile. On ground only near Kharkiv they destroyed a battery as major success.

&gt; Why is westernizing a good thing? Can't these countries just have their own culture? 

I don't know, do you like the benefits of intellectualism that came out of ancient Greece and Rome that was preserved by the western churches? Or would you prefer to have a sterilized culture incapable of competing with western technology?

&gt; You're using westernize as a synonym for modernize. Many western countries could probably do with a little more modernizing for that matter (the US).

Well no, you're just recognizing that modernization is almost always a part of westernization. By every measurable standard the US and Western Europe are the most modernized and developed, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. 

&gt; Also, Russia has grown far more dependent on China than the West. For better or for worse depends on your ideology.

Is that why they shut down their only tank factory because France and Germany stopped selling them parts? Or are you talking about the rubber tires China sold Russia that just seemed to fall apart driving down the road?

Maybe Russia can rely on their own production in the coming years, if they manage to take Ukraine's factories without destroying them.",587cdfa4a8e58f28d97bf513649149332bca788e,True,False,,,,,0,1654463055,,0,{},ibal0hd,False,t3_v4leb7,False,True,t1_ibaiuaq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v4leb7/russian_paratroopers_in_a_firefight_somewhere_in/ibal0hd/,1654463072,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654434255.0,

This might give the perception that the foreign legion has not been active in the Donbass until recently.

Looking at the footage from the Georgian foreign legion, they seem to be a bit more consistent across the different fronts.

Military expert Boris Rozhin - @ColonelCassad brief summary on Severodonetsk:

1.
Fighting continues in the area of ​​the industrial zone of the Azot plant. The enemy also maintains communication with Lisichansk through one of the damaged bridges - heavy equipment passes there with great difficulty, but some vehicles pass.


2.
The transfer of reinforcements from Lysichansk to Severodonetsk, after the Armed Forces surrendered almost the entire city, made it possible to stay in the Azot area and start fighting in the adjacent residential area, while Ukrainian sources themselves admit that there is no ambition to recapture Severodonetsk.
The fighting will accordingly continue in the industrial area, and part of Severodonetsk will soon turn into an analogue of Mariupol in terms of the destruction of high-rise buildings and other residential buildings, taking into account the active work of the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Severodonetsk.


3.
It is unlikely that the command of the RF Armed Forces plans to storm Lisichansk head-on after taking the industrial zone of Severodonetsk. The real assault on Lisichansk will begin when they break through the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Privolye and Ustinovka, advancing to the outskirts of the city, regardless of what will happen in the industrial complex.


4.
Of key importance for all these battles is the struggle for the Artemovsk-Lysichansk highway, since having no control over it devalues ​​any efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to hold Lisichansk and Severodonetsk, unless, of course, there is a plan to sacrifice the entire grouping of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as all foreign mercenaries thrown into Azot industrial zone.


5.
So far, the RF Armed Forces have ensured complete fire control over the route, which has already affected the supply of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk. But there is no complete block on the highway yet, so individual vehicles and groups are still passing, but full-fledged supply, which was still possible back in the first half of May, can no longer be ensured, despite all efforts to push the RF Armed Forces away from the area of ​​Belogorovka and Berestovoye. The current task of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in this direction is to grind the enemy's reserves in oncoming battles and cross the Artemovsk-Lysichansk highway.


6.
Naturally, some activity of the RF Armed Forces in the direction of Seversk is also expected, since taking under fire control (which is not yet available) the Artemovsk-Seversk-Lysichansk highway will lead to the notorious operational encirclement of the Severodonetsk grouping, which will simply lose the ability to supply through Artemovsk, and any retreat will be associated with serious losses.


7.
Therefore, in the near future, on the one hand, we will observe positional battles in the area of ​​​​the Severodonetsk industrial zone and high-intensity battles north of Soledar.

Interesting section here about what the German foreign intelligency agency thinks

&gt; 
&gt;  Russia is on the advance in eastern Ukraine, with military experts beginning to wonder how long the Ukrainian military can continue standing up to the onslaught. The Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, fears that Ukrainian resistance could even be broken in the next four to five weeks. In a number of classified briefings in recent days, BND analysts have noted that while the Russians are moving much more slowly than they did at the beginning of the war, they are able to conquer small bits of territory each day. The BND thinks it possible that Putin’s troops could bring all of the Donbas under their control by August. Which means that it makes a huge difference whether German weapons are delivered next week or at some point in August.",e4160f40b25243db9fbec3fe84c09d321243a2da,True,False,,,,,0,1654460457,,0,{},ibafli7,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t3_v5d4n0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibafli7/,1654460469,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654431657.0,

Not sure what system you're referring to but the updated rockets launched by the M270 and HIMARS are far more accurate than those launched by both the TOS1A or the Grad which are by far the most numerous of these types of systems the Russians have. Those two systems have nowhere close to a 300 km range and the US one that does have a 300 km range is not what will be given to Ukraine.

Anyway the rockets the grad and TOS1A fire are not GPS guided like the M30/M31 rockets that the Ukrainians will be getting for their HIMARS systems. The most common variant of missile fired by the Grad has both a shorter range than the M30/M31 rocket and is far less accurate.

1) The stabilisers are extended in the soil. The Tos 1 seems to be perfectly capable to fire without them ( for example as seen here : [https://www.militaryimages.net/media/tos-1-buratino-220mm-multiple-rocket-launcher.25247/](https://www.militaryimages.net/media/tos-1-buratino-220mm-multiple-rocket-launcher.25247/)) so that suggests to me that they were 'not in a hurry' . (which is odd if they are firing at this range).   


2) Observe the white objects on the left of the field.. Active Battlefields have preciously few white objects generally.  I deem it possible they are for training purposes.   


3) The brown trodden tracks on the foreground are quite interesting in their pattern shape and form. Again, suggests something of a shooting range, but could have been entrenched positions and only the TOS remaining on the frontline or something (?).   


4) The white smoke is oddly placed. It's not enough to really do much - at that range - but it's also too much to just be a casual fire of sorts. It does seem chemical smoke. It should have been deployed closer to the vehicle if done correctly to avoid being targeted from the treeline, I guess.   


All in all I find the whole setup odd. It does feel like a training ground, but it's hard to conclusively prove it. 

p.s. They are firing in an open field, presumably against infantry (As no larger vehicles are visible). Infantry could make it to the tree line with a Javelin or anything else and be in a prime position to engage this vehicle.

It is virtually impossible for Russia/Soviets to have planned to achieve any sort of parity when they faced such disproportionate loss rates in real world engagements. Further, NATO achieved this in Tanks, Planes, and a bunch of other equipment classes. 

We know from released Soviet documents that they seriously overestimated their Army's ability to engage with NATO in some type of relative equipment parity. They didn't know how bad their stuff compared. The Soviets weren't ever close to achieving the the types of attrition balances necessary to equally engage a NATO supplied army in anything close to parity. We didn't know it at the time, but we know it now. 

They can't build as well as the west so they just pretend it was always supposed to be that way, like it was all part of some grand strategy, like they were always designed to lose huge numbers but win in the end.

And once a crew misused their 88 in the right way it's true power was unlocked and it ended up in everything from towed AT to tank destroyers and Tanks.

 If not winning, another 1500m to get out again. 

 That gun for a while meant death with no hope of surviving for Sherman crews already before some battles had begun. Where it was used in traps luring Shermans on to battle fields on which they were trapped to far away to do damage and had to far back to safety to even hope to make it - for a while in some specific battles they were not better, but so much better they mounted on Tanks made the order to attack 100% suicides if not 15 to 1. And still then in more than one case such numerical superiorities ended up with 15-25 Shermans destroyed in which 2/3 of crews were dead for 2 Tigers!

That is next level shit, showing up in one of the best tanks in the world on a battle field with 10 Tanks per enemy Tiger and Panther - and still basically ALL be dead in 20 minutes.

 It was soon over though. Tactics changed. Tanks changed. German production all but stopped and it was all for nothing soon after, 

 For a while though, and on some battle fields.

Once it became the short-long range MLRS system via the ballistic computer it was something to be reckoned with. Then in 2020 they released the updated version which we thought they are running but can't confirm had a range of 10km (6 miles). The reason I say can't confirm is that there has been record during this conflict of them launching these guys and their other MLRS systems over 300KM (186 miles) which is encroaching  on the US m270 500KM (310 miles) - But with stupid crazy pin point accuracy. The M270 is designed to disperse smaller muntions on target. More so for light vehicles, encampments, personnel.
When you are fighting in mountains, hills etc your firing distance doesn't need to be that far...just accurate, id also like to add that they can shoot 2x the amount of rockets with a larger payload then the US/NATO m270 which albeit has a long range, the vehicle itself is under armored, under powered and smaller payload. Not saying its better, but the TOS-1 doesn't need the same security and is designed to take out entrenched artillery, tanks, bunkers. It moves within a tank battalion as artillery support but  if there are any arty guys here they know ""the god of war is and has been artillery"".

i have quite a bit of infantry experience myself and I disagree. 

A team sized element ran into a defended trench line within hand grenade range, reacted to contact and got on line, took good cover, everyone was firing back, they started tossing frags. That's not incompetence, that's actually a pretty good response. Incompetence would be things like disordered effort with no team work, individuals running away or hiding, doing really stupid shit like not using cover and concealment, etc. 

And you're focused on a single Ukrainian rifleman holding them up. How do you know there weren't more? Even this drone footage shows what appears to be 1x white hot spots in the field to the left of the trench defender and 1-2 more behind the trench, which likely means there are probably other Ukrainians in the area. 

More so, how would the Russians then know there was only one? Is that a realistic tactical assessment? Based on your military experience and knowledge, how often is a single lone soldier expected to hold a trench defensive position without any mates around? Almost never, if so that's a major fuck up on their part, even an LP/OP is supposed to have 2x men to watch each other, and still within relatively close distance to the main body. If the Russians found an actual defensive position the way they did, blundering into it and reacting to contact, there is no way for them to know there isnt a full squad nearby, mutually supported positions, etc. It's actually dangerously stupid to assume the defender is alone, because again, nobody is supposed to be alone in ground warfare.",02bbb32c3dbaf99a103201a3757c11bcf02afa8a,True,False,,,,,0,1654457169,,0,{},iba8t4e,False,t3_v58sgg,False,True,t1_ib8f0qx,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v58sgg/russian_vdv_attacking_ukrainian_position_in/iba8t4e/,1654457183,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654428369.0,

But by taking out the BMP and all those troops they just stopped about 12 different individual people spreading out, taking cover, and returning fire.

So then all that is left is the tank, just 4(?) guys alone in one vehicle that can't just take cover or spread out etc. They are panicking, they are too busy shouting at each other about trying to find the enemy, switching optics, or moving to call in any accurate support.


The tank is a sitting duck against a prepared anti-tank ambush team. They could risk the extra time to reload to hit it next. It was risky of course. The tank was aiming for them. For all we knew it was about to fire and wipe them all out.

1452,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"1. It is not worse strategically, that is a universal statement that has no basis.  Example: I spend an extra 20M extra on an F-35 and it shoots down five SU-57's without single loss, it doesn't matter how much cheaper the SU-57 is or how much more serviceable, it will get destroyed for no battlefield advantage.  We've seen examples of this over and over again.  Cheap, but less effective, weapons have their place, but there is nothing that makes them strategically better in a vacuum when their effectiveness limits their ability to attrite the enemy.  Look at the F-15, F-16, Abrams, etc.. kill-to-loss rates.  There is not a country on earth that would choose Russia equipment based solely on effectiveness in mass use.  Look at what happened to the simple, cheaper equipment in Desert Storm, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War, etc.. it was completely outclassed by western equipment.  In every single engagement where modern Soviet/Russian equipment has come against modern western equipment it has lost decisively both numerically and when perceived through an attrition strategy.  You're simply wrong.

2.  This is nonsense. Every country on earth seeks simplicity of production, logistics, and training as a goal.  It was not exclusive to the Soviets, nor was it some hallmark of theirs compared to the rest of the Allies.  Have you seen a production Sherman? A Sten Gun? A Grease-gun?  You can't attribute one or two element of the war (which all participants were seeking) to success.  You could just as easily say the 10's of billions in American assistance was the decisive factor, the relative demographics, or the relative size of the economies were the deterministic factors. 

3.  Israel is a small country and they do quite well with US equipment, winning many wars against much larger Soviet-supplied forces. Iran slaughtered the Iraqi (soviet-made) air force fighters with their western-made jets.  Small countries can effectively employ expensive western equipment without the USA's budget or logistics.

Unlikely given how Zelensky consistently asks for more air defense systems. The fact that footage from the start of the war is being posted also doesn't bode well for the integrity of the air defense. Finally, Russians strategic bombers have been operating over Ukraine proper, they aren't too scared.

&gt;thr S-300 launcher has its own radar.

The only version that has this capability is the S-300V TEL, which Ukraine has only a few of. Most of the force is S-300P variants which rely on a battery radar.

&gt;On top of that S-300 can be given literally geospatial coodrinates by ant other radar. It sill fire the missiles and they will home in thrm selves.

The only missile in Ukrainian inventory with semi-active homing is 5K55KD. Again, Ukraine doesn't have very many of them, and there still needs to be a lock from a targeting radar until the radar on the missile itself can begin to track around 15-20 miles from the target.",90d9c77475e5224c4ca85dae0c8451ae3cf98518,True,False,,,,,0,1654452284,,0,{},ib9ykq0,False,t3_v4tbvn,False,True,t1_ib6yrwd,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v4tbvn/newly_released_footage_of_a_ukrainian_s300/ib9ykq0/,1654452299,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654423484.0,

1600,[],False,,marrchERRY,,,[],,,,text,t2_5gaeqbda,False,False,"&gt;Over a thousand victims of Ukraine’s military aggression against Donbass were discovered in unnamed graves. From the summer to the present, an active search for all victims of the Ukrainian military and their allied Far-Right militias has been underway, culminating in the creation of a joint committee which includes representatives of the Donetsk (DPR) and Luhansk (LPR) People’s Republics, investigators, forensic experts and others. Investigations into the mass graves will form the foundation of a future tribunal against Kiev. Collected dossiers of Ukraine’s war crimes in Donbass have already been transferred to international authorities.

There is colossal work that needs to be carried out in Donetsk. Since 2014, about 130 burial places of missing persons have been discovered. It is not known how many more there are. According to Daria Morozova, head of the commission for the search of missing persons in Donetsk, more than 3,000 claims have already been sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

“There is information that the documents have been accepted for consideration and included in the evidence base,” Morozova said.

According to the head of the DPR forensic medical examination bureau Dmitry Kalashnikov, the investigated graves contain people who died during the Ukrainian military’s artillery shelling. However, there are also remains of people with traces of torture and bullet wounds perpetrated by the Far-Right militias.

“There were cases when people came and knew by their names those who were buried in unknown graves, but they had no death certificates. In such situations, children cannot receive survivor pensions and other social benefits,” Kalashnikov said.

In Luhansk, teams are also continuing to search for victims of Ukrainian aggression. Seven out of 17 discovered mass graves were investigated, 300 bodies of the dead were exhumed and almost 400 people donated blood for DNA examination. The remains of many victims were reburied in November at a cemetery in Luhansk, where a memorial complex is being created.

Anna Soroka, chair of the interdepartmental working group on the search for burials in the LPR, said: “the enemy went so far as to prevent the burial of the dead, cemeteries were mined, people could not send their loved ones on their final journey.”

“As for tortured civilians from the graves, if the places of these graves are put on a map, then they fall on settlements that have been under the control of the so-called Ukrainian ‘volunteer battalions.’ We have information where they were based. It is there that the bodies with traces of torture and execution are located,” she added.

Donbass residents also submitted burial site examination results to the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court. The Commission managed to establish communication with private groups of Ukrainian volunteers and human rights defenders who are looking for missing persons on Kiev-controlled territory.

Meanwhile, Kiev’s authorities completely ignore the Donetsk and Luhansk initiative to establish cooperation in this area. The reasons for non-cooperation are clear: the perpetrators of aggression do not want to admit crimes and be held accountable. Therefore, Kiev is blocking all proposals for a joint search of missing persons and mass graves.

Of the international organizations and bodies, only the Red Cross provides assistance in exhuming bodies in Donbass. Although the OSCE has all necessary information and records, visit morgues and mass graves, and document violations and take photographs, their published reports are emasculated and their conclusions biased.

This manipulation of information was assessed by LPR representative Andrey Marochko: “I have read all their reports from 2015 to this day. […] In general, drafts of OSCE reports leave Luhansk in voluminous terms, and already from their office in Kiev, fairly cleaned up versions are published. […] Sometimes even journalists recorded the mistakes of the OSCE mission representatives who saw violations, but this was not reflected in the reports.” As an example, Marochko cited how an OSCE representative was captured near a Ukrainian tank, but this tank was not listed in the report.

After the kidnapping of Luhansk observer Andriy Kosyak, the Joint Center for Control and Coordination issued a number of statements for the OSCE to influence the terrorist-like behavior of Ukraine. There is still no reaction from the European mission even though a month and a half has passed since the abduction of the Luhansk observer by Ukrainian saboteurs. As a result, the OSCE mission is limited in movement across LPR until Kosyak is released.

In order to break the obvious information blockade, the DPR and the LPR are creating a special site, “The Tragedy of Donbass”, to collect data on Ukrainian war crimes and on those missing. The project aims to process and organize data and provide access for the general public to collate stories of survivors and victims. Just as importantly, it will also provide the names, ranks and other information of Ukrainians suspected of committing crimes against humanity, including mass killings.

Although this resource will assist in highlighting Ukraine’s war crimes, true accountability cannot be made until the OSCE is depoliticized and carries out the work it is expected to do in an apolitical manner. However, there is little evidence that this will occur in the short-term.",87f6c1e7553b8e26e927b5e4f3d84359d8d4cc89,True,False,,,,,0,1654451203,,0,{},ib9w8qx,False,t3_v54dpf,False,True,t1_ib9tpip,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v54dpf/at_the_edge_of_the_abyss_the_battle_for_mariupol/ib9w8qx/,1654451216,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654422403.0,

1607,[],False,,Sociojoe,,,[],,,,text,t2_4mryd,False,False,"It is a cost/benefit issue for Putin based on what I've read. If he calls it a war, there is a bunch of additional powers Russia's military can use to try and fix some of their issues, but there's also some major downsides.

Benefits to calling it a war:

1. They can draft more people to fix their personnel issues.
2. They can send conscripts into battle zones more easily. (Right now they're not supposed to do so, but it is still happening) 
3. They can prevent soldiers from quitting. (Kind of like stop-loss)
4. They can issue much stronger charges if a soldier quits/deserts, etc..  
5. Economically, there are likely some things Russia can do too.

Downsides:

1. Politically, if you declare a war of your choosing, the public expect you to win.  You have to have tanks rolling down the streets of Kyiv.  If you can't do that, then the public will likely see that you've lost and there are political (and historical) ramifications for that. Russia is struggling and even if they declare war, it might not actually allow them to win. Committing to war you might not be able to win is a bad idea politically.
2.  It looks really bad internationally.  Right now, they can hide behind some wording and some vague goals about denazification.  If you declare war, even allied sitting nations start looking at you like funny. 
3. Much of what needs to be accomplished above in the ""benefits"" can also be accomplished by spending extra money.  That negates a lot of the downside of a war declaration for a small additional cost. 
4. War is incredibly unpopular. Mobilization doubly so.  There are huge political and economic costs to drafting people.  Putin might not want to pay that price.  For Russia, both the Chechen War and the Afghan war ended because of mass political upheaval due to the unpopularity of conscription. Look at the USA in Vietnam too.
5. It locks Russia into the war.  Right now, Russia can retreat to the Feb 24 lines and Ukraine is unlikely to keep pushing.  Both sides can sit down and negotiate from there. Russia will be in a bad spot long-term due to sanctions, etc... but at least they still have some leverage (controlled territory) to negotiate with and save face.

&gt;14k deaths by the Ukrainians since 2014, confirmed by OSCE

Yeah, no dude. First of all, it wasn't the OSCE. The OSCE study found 161 civilian deaths from 2017-2020. 

The OHCHR, which is the UN's version of the OSCE, produced a study that does find 14,000-14,500 have been killed since 2014. 

But that includes soldiers. 6,500 Russians + militia and 4,600 Ukrainian soldiers.

~3,400 civilians were killed. **It does not state by whom.** From what we've seen so far I don't doubt that the majority were from Russians, they seem to not have any problem indiscriminately shelling residential areas.

The OSCE, which you seem to trust as a source, found that **Ukraine has not purposefully targeted civilians in the Donbas.**

\- Brimstone, Harpoon Block IC+, Byraktar

\- Spain to provide Leopard 2A along with additional weaponry

\- Advanced radars, counter battery radars

\- A literally metric ton of Anti-Tank and Anti-Air portable systems

\- They also received self propelled howitzers from Italy, Norway, Finland

\- 12 Phz 2000 self propelled howitzers from Germany &amp; Netherlands

The UNSC voted unanimously that Iraq was in breech of various disarmament requirements set forth in the 90’s. The only disagreement was on whether the breech required the use of force. Even Russia, a month after the invasion, was still unconvinced that Iraq was disarmed of banned weapons.

And of course, this isn’t a comparison of liar US vs honest Russia. Russia has been lying about their casus belli from the start. Unfortunately for them, virtually nobody in the UN believes the claimed conditions exist, let alone believe the claims justify a use of force.

&gt;2.	⁠That’s true the protests were much bigger but I can make a counter point - how many western people were arrested for opposing the wars versus how many Russians?

How is this a counter point at all? If anything, you’re making a point for the “western” side. I guess you’re trying to say that more Russians may protest if they weren’t risking arrest, but that’s a minuscule point compared to the fact that “western” nations actually provide for protest and democracy, and the fact that entire political groups in these nations still tout their original opposition to the invasion of Iraq as a defining characteristic.",bfd7e5a27123c1d6798f48cdb0d106c0a9dd3a1a,True,False,,,,,0,1654446627,,0,{},ib9mgw5,False,t3_v5c8yf,False,True,t1_ib8xvv6,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5c8yf/dpr_ukrainian_rebels_grads_multiple_launch_at/ib9mgw5/,1654446638,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654417827.0,

US overthrown Ukraine‘s government back in 2014 and triggered a proxy war between

US and Russia，（see 2014 Ukraine crisis wiki page for more information on this，or the documentary “Ukraine on fire”，and also there is a Vice documentary）

most of the fighting happened between 2014-2016，somehow when Trump got into office this side project was put on hold

US restarted this proxy war by training more troops to send in donbas region as well as weapons to prepare for a decisive attack on the separatists regions

which Russia reacted with deploying it's troops along Ukraine’s boarders

and the rest is ongoing history

Russia invades Ukraine for it's national security interesting and in the name of

liberating the donbas people from nazi terror. and in support of the separatist states.

and us invaded Ukraine basically to fuck with Russia aiming to overthrow and take control of the Russian regime. while claiming it's defending a sovereign nation against expansionist Russia，when in fact they destroyed Ukraine's sovereignty and pushed Ukraine into this chaos in the first place.

so yes, nobody actually give a fuck except US and their lackies，like Poland who historically hates Russia，this is a US vs Russia War，even though they try to claim it's in the interest of Ukraine, and protecting freedom and all that crap.",399356aebb14663bd02743de09582e50bddde00e,True,False,,,,,0,1654445444,,0,{},ib9jz66,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ib998ma,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ib9jz66/,1654445456,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654416644.0,

Let’s see about that.

&gt;They took up arms in order not to get burned to death 

The reason is irrelevant, but by taking up arms you are starting a war.

&gt;Second thing

Wait what? You refuted nothing I said yet and you’re already on 2?

&gt;I do not understand what you mean exactly? 1 year old government?

2014, something happened in 2014 before the war.. cmon, mate. 

&gt;But Ukraine government is like a century old in its current form since the founding of soviet Ukraine 

Obviously I mean after the old government fled the country and a new government was elected, a military not used since the soviet era, yes the government of Ukraine was pretty fresh come post revolution, with a lot going on. 

&gt;what is it mean shitty soviet spec military? 

Ukraine’s military in 2014 was a typical top down soviet style military, with outdated soviet equipment. Therefore - shit soviet spec. 

&gt;Finally, I find your stance on the German side in WWII a bit problematic. 

Let’s see what problems you actually mention, hm?

&gt;I understand that the British wanted to get revenge for the London bombing campaign, but still, one crime does not justify another 

Yes it does, if you start invading other countries, you have forfeited peace. Your cities are now production centres, part of the war effort. Your construction sites are now enemy infrastructure. Britain bombing Germany’s cities caused Germany to stop bombing the RAF, and instead bomb London, also as it was much easier and less precise. This helped the British. But my core point is, do you *really* want to debate between Germany and Britain in WW2 who was the bad guy? Yes, britain firebombed Dresden, yes, Canadian soldiers treated Germans terribly, yes, American massacres of Germans exist, and while they are not justified crimes, the actual point being made is that those small events did not decide who was right or wrong. 

Germany unjustly invaded other sovereign nations, and therefore it was the bad guy. Same with Russia in Ukraine. 

&gt;if you approve pure revenge 

That’s not the thing, it doesn’t matter what you or I think, it’s deciding who’s in the wrong. 

If you attack someone in the street but the gouge your eyes out, it’s your fault for starting a fight, sure everyone will say “that’s kinda fucked, *but HE started it.” 

Don’t want a fight, don’t start one. Don’t want death? Don’t start a damn war.

&gt;But we should atleast say, today, that it would not be acceptable tactic at our present time.

That’s not for us to decide, it’s for the provocateur. Russia started this war bombing Ukrainian cities and massacring civillians, that’s the war they set. Ukraine is atleast in the excuse that it is fighting for survival unlike Russia, and therefore it’s more justified for them to fight dirty if they have to.

Tl;dr, you failed to refute me at all. Ukraine is indeed doing some things that aren’t great, but *still* they are the good guy of the two in this war.",3f35a951d4016bb1190a87ee272d817040d7679b,True,False,,,,,0,1654444795,,0,{},ib9im10,False,t3_v54isu,False,True,t1_ib9g2u0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v54isu/ukrainian_soldier_records_mlrs_being_fired_into/ib9im10/,1654444809,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654415995.0,

That shell fell about meters from them. They were extremely lucky and only 2 people got lightly wounded from small fragments. Notice that one tree is falling in the video from shrapnel impact, if anything like that hit one of them, they would have been eviscerated, or a leg or arm would fly off them. Shrapnel is ultra dangerous, but it is a lottery.  
Have seen a video where a small artillery shell fell like 20-30 m from a soldier. he dropped dead instantly even being far from the explosion. Small mortar shells falling in a street and random people dropping dead 20m away, with some ppl 3m from the impact totally unscathed.

Pointer 17 marks the ammunition carousel. It's vertical position is exactly at the height of the impact. The rear lower glacis armor is 25mm thick. That's nothing. The ATGM's jet stream will (and has in this case) easily reach the ammunition carousel.

Regarding your assumption that this is ""only"" a fuel explosion, check this drawing that shows the location of the T-72 fuel tanks: https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TBfWH3_1MCo/VTPI-W92eeI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/v2KTJkNY9aY/s1600/image.php.jpeg

If I interpret the video correctly, than the tank in the video is missing the optional external mounted fuel barrels (number 10 and 11 in the drawing). But even if those were mounted, there's no way to get such an explosion from just the fuel in those tanks. There is only one other location of gas tanks that is not within the combat compartment (were the crew and the ammunition is). That would be the fuel tanks above the tracks and that's definitely not where the ATGM hit.

I've taken many a downvote because I voiced a critical opinion on videos that showed a hit on a non-critical position and cut off immediately after the hit, but had ""Another Russian tank gets ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED by..."".

2.  Some of the other stuff is rarer. For instance, there isn't that many Uragans and Smerches out there that are able to be acquired. Look at the Wikipedia page. The Uragans out there are in Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyryzstan, Uzbekiztan, Iran, Russia, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria. Ukraine is already using theirs. Moldova and Georgia are probably next on Russia's list if they win in Ukraine so they're unlikely to give theirs up.   The countries that have them are generally Russian client states, fighting wars of their own, or are unable to buy western arms because of massive human rights issues.  One of the ways the Russian arms industry survives is because they're willing to supply countries that are otherwise unable to acquire these types of systems. India could provide some, but what happens post-war when Russia refuses to ever sell India anything again and India gets into a war with China? 

3. NATO gear is almost universally better. I can't think of a single Russian system that I've read about that is considered superior to an equivalent NATO system. The only advantages seem to be cost and serviceability costs. This is not a small matter when you're dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars.  This isn't a shot at Russia, the west makes better stuff but it often costs a lot more and they're often unwilling to sell it because of technology transfer issues, human rights abuses, etc.. 

4.  Even if you acquired the system, you still have to reload it and service it.  Almost all the manufacturing for ammunition  (and parts) for the systems are in Russia. Switching Ukraine to NATO systems allows them to keep the ammo/parts coming.  A Grad is useless without missiles.  

5. Ukraine needs to switch to NATO standards post war anyway if they're going to join NATO.

1.  Russia needs infantry, we have seen throughout this war mechanized units without appropriate infantry support, mass artillery advantages without the infantry to go in, etc.  There is a reason Moscow raised the age limits so Grandpa's could join the military.  

2.  DPR and LPR units are deployed outside of their territories and may not want to fight.  

3.  The Russian advances aren't going so well and they once again hit a city/river that is causing mass casualties.  Usually to DPR and LPR troops first.  

4.  The US is sending long range missiles to Ukraine and Russia wants to pretend Ukraine is using them to bomb civilians as a precedent.

The reason that trenches have 90 degree angles is to negate pressure waves. They worked that out in WW1. Nikola Tesla made the Tesla valve based on the same principles.

In this case, their hatch was open. When you have a high-pressure event behind that, the amount of overall pressure that will make it into the crew compartment is small compared to the entire event. It might be huge relative to your hearing, but overall, it's nothing compared to what's happening outside. Your eardrums are a thin AF flap of skin. Can sound loud, can be broken easily. But is not lethal. Most of the explosion went sideways and upwards, hence the visuals.

It's like water or electricity. The energy goes to the point of least resistance. In this case, it's straight into the atmosphere in every direction. That's why the entire frame is taken up by the flames. How much pressure made it into the actual turret via the open hatch? Not too much, and certainly not enough to do anything to the thick armour that makes up the turret.

In order to penetrate the turret, you need a high impulse event. Kind of how tazers are 20,000 volts, but 0.0001 amps and it'll disable your nervous system and you'll live. But if you stick a fork into a 240 volt, 10 amp outlet and you're toast. It's the amps that matter in that case. The impulse, a sudden event. Substitute the amps for the timeframe that the energy gets released. Fuel burning makes a good visual, but is 'slow'. Low amps. Yet if that happened in the blink of an eye, it'd be a high-amp event, and on top of that as I said, most of the energy went straight into the atmosphere and blowing off panels that were on the outside of the tank.

Notice that animals that require enhanced hearing develop larger ears to capture more pressure (sound), and those can be bent back in case of too much pressure, rather than having a larger earhole to achieve the same effect. That limits the effects of overpressure. It's hard for pressure to go into a small hole. It's way easier for it to be dissipated into the general environment. I've never seen an animal with large earholes. But I have seen plenty with large, flexible ears. And it's the same case here. A small hatch is open. It can also be blown closed.

Sorry for the essay, but I feel the need to explain the dynamics behind it after so many people can't understand what's happening. One comment said that a guy bailed from the tank, and got upvotes. Right below, I say that it isn't necessarily lethal, and my comment is downvoted into oblivion because a bunch of people saw a large fireball.",2da128e445e5445d04131cd5a90b570ca0046708,True,False,,,,,0,1654440419,,0,{},ib99owc,False,t3_v5bmhl,False,True,t1_ib90h8f,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5bmhl/fsa_tow_catastrophic_kill_on_t72_syria_saleppo/ib99owc/,1654440436,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654411619.0,

Those just as a complete amateur why would you put your self on a wider defensive when you can cycle in depth defence since you hold better positions.

Ukraine now depends on which report/map you believe holds 50-70% of the city. It seems they are extracting an extremely heavy toll on Russians here and pinning them down to buy one thing that people can't get past their thick skulls. TIME TIME TIME fucking TIME is what Ukraine needs.

TIME for the absurdity of overwhelming weapons packages coming their way in next 2-3 weeks, time to train up with NATO on their systems, time to setup logistics, time for NATO trained troops to return home and time to finalise training mobilised troops.

We saw what happens with Russian professional soldiers who go past 3 months of training then are on bench for years. Or even worse poorly trained and mobilised civilians.

There is no point in holding completely kicking the enemy out of the city if you can pin him down.

That doesn't make the CAESAR photos a collage of training photos. These are all legitimate needs for any military in the war, and there's no reason why they have to stage to get photos instead of being right on the front line where these artillery pieces are currently being needed the most.

&gt;Also there are no information of them being used in the east.

There's no information on them being used *anywhere*. And there's a good reason why: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations\_security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security)

The location of critical weapon systems like submarines in the US are kept under lock and key at all times. They do not broadcast their location. Modern systems like CAESAR are as valuable as nuclear submarines to the US. Why the hell would they tell the Russians that: ""Hey, we have our best, foreign-made artillery pieces located right here. Come and take it.""

&gt;Better this than alternative. So many bullshit biased takes there is about almost every event.

Then, like I said, you don't learn anything at all. And as I've already demonstrated, you already judged a photo wrongly for a non-sense and comical reason (I genuinely laughed at your reasoning).

Link the page or take a screenshot because I doubt that's talking about mass shooters. 




&amp;nbsp;


&gt;**Results**: Assault rifles accounted for **430 or 85.8% of the total 501 mass-shooting fatalities reported** (95% confidence interval, 82.8-88.9) i**n 44 mass-shooting incidents**. Mass shootings in the United States accounted for an increasing proportion of all firearm-related homicides (coefficient for year, 0.7; p = 0.0003), with increment in year alone capturing over a third of the overall variance in the data (adjusted R = 0.3). In a linear regression model controlling for yearly trend, the federal ban period was associated with a statistically significant 9 fewer mass shooting related deaths per 10,000 firearm homicides (p = 0.03). **Mass-shooting fatalities were 70% less likely to occur during the federal ban period** (relative rate, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.39).

&gt;**Conclusion**: Mass-shooting related homicides in the United States were reduced during the years of the federal assault weapons ban of 1994 to 2004.

You're thinking of restraint in binary and absolute term instead of relative. Is dropping agent orange same as dropping agent orange AND a nuclear weapon? If you set up an argument in a way where crossing a line in the sand means no restraint was used, then there's no difference between using agent orange and committing a Holocaust. After all, neither show restraint according to your own definition. I am using a more useful definition which is a sliding scale. I am not saying US did 0, I am saying they did 10 when they could've done a 100. And the difference between 10 and 100 constitutes restraint. 10 shows lack of restraint. I agree using agent orange represents lack of restraint, but the entire war was fought with a greal deal of restraint given what US could've done but chose not to.",5581dd0a195e32d9f7c6a04e461b02020e98669c,True,False,,,,,0,1654434700,,0,{},ib8zay9,False,t3_v4r6yw,False,False,t1_ib8xvn1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v4r6yw/3_clips_showing_the_effectiveness_of_the_m230/ib8zay9/,1654434715,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654405900.0,

But Agent Orange wasn’t used to destroy buildings or target military installations, so comparing its destruction to actual explosive munitions doesn’t mean anything. Agent Orange was used to destroy foliage, and to destroy crops. The US deliberately targeted food supplies, despite many of these been in civilian towns and villages. Agent Orange has caused birth defects in now 3rd generation children from those who originally got exposed to it. Kids today are suffering from a war in which their parents weren’t even alive for. 

You can’t commit a war crime, and say because we didn’t carpet bomb everyone and everything to death and rubble when we could’ve, we showed restraint. When you have 3 million soldiers and over 100 billion dollars in a conflict, that’s a complete and total involvement in a conflict. That’s not a half measure. 

That’s not true, as the UK used the same chemicals in Malaysia during the 1950s, so by 1960-1970s, the effects were known. It was debated in the United Nations numerous times during the Vietnam war, with the US strongly backing itself against other countries calling for the use of the chemical to end. 

It’s not rational to say the US showed restraint in some parts but not others. It was a decision made by the military that had no restraint, thus the US military used no restraint in Vietnam. 

The USSR had 3000 soldiers that had some combat encounters. There’s even reports they shot down US aircraft. I’d say that’s active combatants. 

Compare it to now. RUS vs Ukraine. If Russia mobilised their entire air force and sent all their soldiers in at the start, Ukraine wouldn’t be a country anymore.

It's certainly a badge of honor among soldiers. When people find out what I did for a career they invariably say and ask a variation of:  ""Thank you for your service, Did you ever kill anyone? Were you ever shot?"" 

Some do it sort of straightforward, kids however are blunt and I love them for it. Most however just kind of stumble around the questions worried about triggering a flashback or whatever kind of stereotypical crazed veteran response they imagine they might get. That makes me as uncomfortable as they appear to be when asking. I always remember being a teen or even as a young soldier and it was hard to find a veteran let alone get them to spill the beans on what it's actually like because of that weird stigma of ""You shouldn't ask that"". I very clearly remember deciding I would not do that and would venture to describe in detail what it was like. Not just a simple it's scary but those layers of thoughts we all have, layers of thoughts and emotions stacked on each other every second, and what I found is that its really the bottleneck of speaking or writing that probably causes it. How do you truly describe the seemingly indescribable? I wish I could just touch someone and transfer all of it. Sometimes I feel like Roy Batty... ""You people wouldn't believe the things I've seen"", except I really do wish I could show you and hope you never have to experience it for yourself. It's not all horror and grim filled though. A moonless, star filled Afghan night on a mountain peak is still the most stunning thing I've ever laid my eyes on. It feels like you could just reach up and pluck a star and put it in your pocket. And then right below that heaven men were fighting and dying, lead and steel ripping through the air and flesh, tracers streaking across the void, bright white flashes of impacts, the concussion evicting the air from your lungs. To call it wild is an understatement, and to keep it all to myself I think would be criminal.

All this footage we now have access to gives a glimpse into the experience, but it does not capture its essence. It's more light ESPN highlights. Clips of selected moments of a much longer action. Can't smell the battlefield from a video and it's hard to explain just how much of the experience is lost without that. 

Sorry, I'm having my morning coffee and watching the sun make its slow ascent and kind of veered wildly off course there for a bit. But yeah, I got a wicked scar from a chunk of hot rocket steel and it definitely still strikes me as being pretty rad given the right moment. Mostly it reminds that all of that was real life. All of that insanity was real and now everyday I can see videos of Ukrainians  having to embrace that insanity as their reality as we commenate as though watching a sporting event and it's absolutely surreal to me.",a81c0028ddba1f6a2d4fe0eae3fe40e9545d167a,True,False,,,,,0,1654428134,,0,{},ib8pvdx,False,t3_v4mn3q,False,True,t1_ib8clwq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v4mn3q/near_artillery_and_a_loud_shrapnel_sound_over/ib8pvdx/,1654428145,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654399334.0,

Yeah, that study was/is commonly misinterpreted by tankies. You might want to take a look at the actual facts involved.

https://nintil.com/the-soviet-union-food/

&gt;these figures are for food supply, not ingestion, which is lower because of losses. The CIA analysts also estimate that losses from production to consumption are higher than in the US.

&gt;Soviet utilisation of food (from the Soviet Interview Project). Apparently, even when the USSR was the world's largest milk producer, only 60% of this milk was consumed by humans (36% was fed to animals, and the remainder was wasted). This number was around 90% in the case of the US. 7% of it was converted into 'hard' cheese (24% in Europe). Official Soviet sources (mentioned in pp. 491-541) also confirm the high level of waste and inefficiency in the food supply chain.

&gt;Dronin and Bellinger (2005, 310) point out, per capita consumption figures likely overstate actually available amounts, given that the Soviet Union’s inadequate transportation and storage infrastructure led to frequent shortages in stores, as well as significant loss of foodstuffs and raw products due to spoilage.

&gt;Dronin and Bellinger (2005), for example, questioned the reliability of Soviet food consumption statistics after having discovered a discrepancy between the increases in per capita consumption reported in official government data, and the widespread mentioning of food shortages and rationing by the local Soviet press.

Both foreign observers and the Soviet press repeatedly noted the discrepancies between official production statistics and actual availability of food in stores. In 1988, at the height of perestroika, it was revealed that Soviet authorities had been inflating meat consumption statistics; it moreover transpired that there existed considerable inequalities in meat consumption, with the intake of the poorest socioeconomic strata actually declining by over 30 percent since 1970 (Dronin and Bellinger 2005).

&gt;Another factor that adds to the difficulties of comparing the USSR with the US is that the quality and variety of the goods was inferior. Gertrude Schroeder, a CIA analyst who spent months in different Russian cities reports that the quality of life and goods was worse than she had estimated from reading the literature. Queuing was prevalent when she reported, in 1968. By 1989, they were even more prevalent.

If you're intellectually honest, which you aren't because you're a tankie, then this entire article is a good read.

You could also figure all of this out yourself by talking to a random assortment of people who lived in a USSR country in the 80s versus any Western country in the 80s.

Russia however, sent roughly 3,000 troops in, but did supply a large amount of weapons and SAMs. Just by those numbers alone, which country showed more restraint? 

The US didn’t have to adopt a policy of “kill anything that moves” and murder 100s, if not thousands of unarmed civilians. They had the power to fight without taking those actions.

The US didn’t have to use chemical warfare, but illegally did so anyway. Where is the restraint in that? They had the power to do so, and did it, when they didn’t need too. I think your definition of restraint is quite off. 

So if you want to keep on deludedly saying the US showed restraint in Vietnam, go ahead. But it would be hypocritical of you to say that and not agree that the actions taken by the US were on the majorly extreme side in comparison to the allies of the North. 

In other words, the US barely showed any restraint, while the Chinese and Soviets showed remarkable restraint.

And no, the USSR did not only invade after the government capitulated to prevent a complete German takeover, that's complete nonsense and honestly the first time I have ever heard someone say this. The Soviet troops entered from the east in mid September, as the Polish forces were still engaged in heavy combat with the Germans at that time. The Soviets were involved in some battles with the Polish, and even committed atrocities (Katyn massacre) in case you didn't know.
There never was a Polish capitulation, bc the Polish government fled and set up a gov in exile.

Literally an hour after that, we heard loud female screams upstairs. The woman repeated the same phrase: “Why did they go out, why did they go out, why did they go out ?!” As it turned out, during the shelling, a shell hit one of the apartments, and the woman's son, Denis, ran out into the street from the entrance to see which floor was on fire and try to put out the fire. At this very moment, a sniper kills him with a direct hit to the temple. His father rushes to him - and the next shot kills his father. They lay in front of the house for a whole week. Then a big orange dump truck arrived, already half loaded with bodies, and the DNR soldier threw the bodies of these two guys into it. Denis's mother (she, along with his wife and one-year-old daughter, was sitting with us in the basement) was given the documents and personal belongings that were found from the dead. The ring was not removed from the son's finger, and one of the DNR soldiers suggested cutting off the finger. Can you imagine how they relate to people? The woman, of course, did not agree, then one of the residents brought oil, and with his help the ring was removed.

____________________________

There was another unpleasant meeting, as I assume, with employees of the Ministry of State Security of the DNR. They walked around the yards and asked the residents if someone from the Security Service of Ukraine, from the military, from Ukrainian activists lived in the houses. Well, one decided, obviously, to curry favor with them and handed me over, saying that I was filming everything that was happening on the camera. They call me: “Well, ""correspondent"", tell me what you filmed there.” “Nothing special,” I say. - I filmed how people cook food on fires. But this is no longer there, everything burned down. My apartment is over there, if you want, I can show you two burned-out cameras.” And in the basement where we lived, I had another camera, a whole one, and my entire photo archive. So all this could end very unpleasantly. I remember he also asked: “Did the Chechens cut your heads off?” “No, thank God.” - ""Well, we will cut."" However, they left me behind. And that comrade who wanted to earn “points” at my expense, then got hit in the face from them: he wanted to squeeze out his neighbor’s apartment with their help, but they apparently didn’t like it.

___________________________________

They began to dismantle the rubble of houses and look for corpses, this was done by the Russian Emergencies Ministry. I saw a grader come and scoop up the bodies. Guards stood nearby and made sure that no one drove up and filmed what they were getting out of there. The rubble of the drama theater was also dismantled, I walked by and saw that everything inside was burned out. Once, a young Caucasian, a Russian military man, came to our yard and also asked if there were corpses. It is obvious that they care a lot about it [...] All electrical substations are out of order, many are completely broken. The Russians promise to give light soon, but I have no idea how this is possible. On the eve of May 9, they began to clear the streets - they also had to show some kind of picture on TV. I heard from people that the cleaning was done by locals for rations.

Incorrect assumption. Russia loves artilery. NATO have low supply of 152mm ammo. Russia should have big 152mm ammo supply. If noone will supply UA with 155mm artilerry, then UA can run out of ammo. Europe can stop providing this type of equipment, because France and Germany are asking UA to ""surrender"" (I mean  to get ""peace""). In this scenario every lost 155mm artilery is huge problem.

Also without enought armour UA could have big problems with retaking land. In this case unlimited manpower would change nothing.

A  separatist movement responsible for terrorist attacks across the country on governments and civilians.

On the other hand Ukraine has taken remarkable care to persevere and protect the lives of civilians in harms way, evidence by the fact that Donetsk (a city Russia claims has been ""devastated"" by the civil war) still stands in fact, is relatively untouched by the horrors of the civil war.

the DPR and LPR LOVE to add the deaths of their fighters into their alleged civilian population deaths (most aren't uniformed so its easy to hide their existence) so all we can know is that about 2500 civilians + rebels died in Donetsk in 2014 and 2015, 1185 civilians + rebels died in Luhansk in 2014-2015. After 2015 the fighting relatively died down and most years saw less than 100 civilians die anywhere in the war on both sides (yes Ukrainians civilians died to, killed by the aforementioned terrorist separatists)

Not even to mention the 300+ foreign citizens killed in MH17, of which basically all international investigators agreed were killed by separatists  operating Russian AA systems. 

Compare these relatively low deaths for \~3000 civilians (and not all were civilians) over 8 years of war to the incredibly large number of civilians killed in only **100 days** by Russian forces. 

over 3000 Civillians have been **confirmed** to have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the war, the true total is likely much highers. Especially in cities like Mariupol and Seveirdonetsk civilian casualties  were incredibly high. Some estimates puts Mariupol over **22,000** and at least **6000**

That's a *single battle,* a single battle that killed literally anywhere from 2x to **7x as many as the whole war for 8 years in the Donbas**",8db3855fe26e69aaa9be0d92738c228ff81009ca,True,False,,,,,0,1654416198,,0,{},ib8ct41,False,t3_v528xq,False,True,t1_ib8bcu3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v528xq/shelling_of_voroshilovsky_district_city_center_of/ib8ct41/,1654416211,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654387398.0,

They sent them weapons, training and in many cases soldiers without patches on to fill the ranks of their supposedly grass roots popular secession movement.

It was a fraud from the start, when the country split from the soviet union in the 90s even the most pro-russian areas voted in favor of independence, Russia can claim otherwise but its quite obvious that plenty of people there wanted and still want to be Ukrainian.",122aa4f2db929dfda4b71872317e6b5fce86d305,True,False,,,,,0,1654415090,,0,{},ib8blx7,False,t3_v528xq,False,True,t1_ib87x01,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v528xq/shelling_of_voroshilovsky_district_city_center_of/ib8blx7/,1654415100,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654386290.0,

Because they have to. Because their attempts at larger offensives have failed horribly.

Odessa is surrounded by sea and steep cliffs - Russia has lost most of their landing craft that would make a sea assault possible. Odessa is more than twice the size Mariupol was, and it's built over the largest catacomb network in the world that would make it even more difficult to use Russia's artillery tactics on than Mariupol. An entire city worth of Azovstal.

It's further west - away from Russian logistics, close to Ukrainian - than Mariupol was. It's well prepared for its own defense. And Ukraine will fight much harder for it because if they lose Odessa they lose all port access to the Black Sea and international commerce.

It is *extremely* unlikely to be successfully assaulted, and short of the entire Ukrainian army giving up and committing suicide, almost impossible to assault without *severe* Russian casualties that they can't afford with their limited number of troops.",3432adddab6f9942ae1fa6dada08f84578cc591e,True,True,,,,,0,1654413427,,0,{},ib89ror,False,t3_v2xvtp,False,True,t1_ib6ivtz,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2xvtp/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6222/ib89ror/,1654413442,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654384627.0,

4236,[],False,,dropbbbear,,,[],,,,text,t2_4guzp50v,False,False,"&gt; The US lost Vietnam and didn't fall

That's the thing, they didn't lose militarily, they voluntarily withdrew despite inflicting proportionate casualties on the VC and still being in a good military and economic position to continue the war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive#North_Vietnam_2 - unlike Russia's current position. And unlike the USSR, who suffered disproportionate casualties despite outnumbering the Afghanis.

The US pulled out because people at home were sick of seeing US troops die, totally regardless of whether they were winning. Live footage of the war and casualty reports were available to Americans and they could see what was going on for themselves as the government did not cover up everything that was happening. They could then protest (I'm not saying arrests didn't happen, but anti-war protest was still more permissible than in the USSR/Russia).

And *because* the US *listened to its people and pulled out,* followed by the usual democratic change of leadership, that diffused a lot of the anger and prevented more serious outcomes against the entire governmental system.

But in the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan, casualties and how badly the war was doing was all covered up at home - Russian people only found out through word of mouth, or when mothers found their children were no longer replying to letters. Protest was heavily suppressed. This created disillusionment with the government. As for Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Russia is *literally denying this is even a war or invasion* to its own people.

The USSR didn't listen to the people, as they were not able to publicly and normally express anti-war sentiment; and the same goes for Russia during this invasion, which is actively suppressing protests and jailing huge numbers of people. Protesters are now even being detained for holding signs saying ""war is bad"" or signs that say nothing at all. What message does that send to people who see it?

Another factor for the withdrawal of the Soviets from Afghanistan, which did not apply to the US in Vietnam, was Gorbachev being concerned about sanctions from other countries crippling their economy. And Putin's invasion has also drawn international sanctions against Russia.

One more thing worth mentioning is that 'Nam did not lead to any attacks on US soil. But the Soviet-Afghan war resulted in Afghan raids on the USSR, and Putin's invasion has resulted in (Ukrainian?) missile and helicopter attacks inside Russia.

So in summary:

US in Vietnam War - situation was not hidden from citizens, open protest was mostly possible, disproportionate casualties were not suffered, war was ended democratically followed by democratic change of leadership, war had minor economic impact

USSR in Afghan War - situation hidden from citizens creating distrust, open protest not possible, disproportionate casualties are suffered, war was not ended democratically, leadership was not democractically changed, war had major economic impact 

Russia in Ukraine War - situation hidden from citizens creating distrust, open protest not possible, disproportionate casualties are suffered, there is no democratic recourse for the war to end, leadership has not changed (?), war has major economic impact 

Therefore Vietnam is not an applicable comparison, but the Soviet-Afghan war is.",3b28ee09c8dc736b10c66182ac53ac7c653414e4,True,False,,,,,0,1654411220,,0,{},ib879p4,False,t3_v2xvtp,False,True,t1_ib740k5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2xvtp/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6222/ib879p4/,1654411232,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654382420.0,

As long as Russia keeps getting attacked and is suffering high losses, Russia is definitely not winning. Winning is if you can hold territory without being attacked constantly, and you can't say that about Russia, the front lines change daily. 

The tide of war has already turned early in the war when Russia retreated from Kyiv, the remaining areas its only a matter of time (months) before Ukraine recaptures them and forces Russia to retreat fully. 

Weapons and manpower will be increasing in the weeks ahead for Ukraine, the same cannot be said for Russia. Ukraine has been primarily in defensive mode, wearing down the enemy bit by bit, a few small /medium sized counter-attacks, but when Ukraine is ready, they'll switch over to primarily offensive attacks. 

The Russians have overall performed very poorly since day 1 by western standards and are not expected to get better any time soon, if ever.

This report and Himmler's treachery prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life.[29] Shortly after midnight on 29 April,[30][31] he married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the Führerbunker. The two then hosted a modest wedding breakfast, after which Hitler took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. It left instructions to be carried out immediately following his death, with Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assuming Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor, respectively.[32] Hitler signed these documents at 04:00 and then went to bed. Some sources say that he dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all agree on the timing of the signing.[n][o]

The missile was launched at 3s, and hit at about 9s, taking about 6s to reach the target.

Now consider the scale. I know it's way easier to think about things in absolute terms, but there is nuance. If there is NATIONAL majority (still disputed that they WERE a majority though, they were just the loudest of all), then by definition there can also be a REGIONAL majority - whose opinions, by that logic, should be disregarded and they should bend over by any means necessary, because some retards, somewhere in the capital jumped in protest at the Maidan square, right? 

If you were truly following the events since the start, you'd know that they (Donbass) at first asked for federalization (more autonomy for decision making process for their region) WITHIN Ukraine - that's absolutely normal in any developed country, ex. Hong Kong within China, Quebec within Canada, Northern Ireland within UK, Puerto Rico within US etc etc. But Ukraine (it's handlers, if we're being honest) said NO, it's my way or no way and started bombing the region and with military intrusion prevented people in hundreds of cities across Donbass from gathering to vote on it. It was only after THAT, that actual separatism (on a constitutional level) became a thing, and why shouldn't it after shit that Ukraine pulled? I'm of course oversimplifying the entire ordeal, there is way more to every point I listed. 

If freedom of choice and vote truly mattered and applied to everyone equally (on all scales) would this situation even happen? I doubt it. Ukraine would at least ATTEMPT to compromise with the region that isn't satisfied with the new regime (for good reason). But since it's a once sided democracy, it ain't an issue, correct?

In addition, the efforts to cut back on local militias crippled the defense of the country and most importantly the north, anti Taliban locals had a hard time fighting against the Taliban because of this, finally in the early months of 2021 and going into summer the government removed some of the most competent commanders from their positions and either completely fired them or put them in posts separated from their units where they had little power. Because the militias in the north were weakened the Taliban were able to take over during the last few years and there was nowhere to fall back to when the south was overrun, also because many commanders had been moved the situation was confused and it was hard to rally or reorganize, finally many remaining commanders were offered money and protection to surrender their units and with no real hope left to do more than to holdout in a few provinces many took the deals.",ee196ba37eb8d8fa8e68f7b1b45f2e8e74379066,True,False,,,,,0,1654391939,,0,{},ib7dviu,False,t3_v52iut,False,False,t3_v52iut,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v52iut/why_did_the_afghan_national_army_and_the_new/ib7dviu/,1654391955,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654363139.0,

While Earth-imaging technology has always been considered of vital importance to the U.S. military, the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted the need for detailed, accurate images from the private sector that can not only aid the intelligence community in decision-making, but can also help the public understand what is happening on the ground.

Additionally, tracking the buildup of weapons systems by hostile regimes has only ramped up in recent years as countries such as Iran and North Korea have sought to expand their nuclear capabilities.

The increasing focus of the private sector on Environmental, Social, and Corporate (ESG) governance has also expedited the need for detailed images that show mankind's impact on nature. Many of these initiatives are spurred on by agricultural companies that seek to understand the changes in their land over time, as well as investment banks that have backed farms and other food-producing ventures.

Whether it's in the public or private sector, Earth-imaging has applications to dozens of different industries, and the three companies featured in the NRO's contract are some of the most promising players in this burgeoning field.”

Western armies have had radios down to squad level or below for several decades; this allows squad and team leaders a much greater degree of responsibility and independence. Heck, when I was a platoon signaller overseas, we had two radios per section/squad, on top of four radios in PHQ. Even a brick of four dudes could be detached for a task.

Meanwhile, Russian/Soviet troops have had radios at company level, and sometimes platoon level if they were doing well (usually radios and their operators were allocated by the regimental signals company, whereas radios are organic to each Western company). To compound on their issues, they don't even have enough of their new radios (Azart) for that. How do they make up for this shortage in a modern war against a sophisticated opponent?

&gt;**Non-military Actions**  
&gt;  
&gt;Putin would initiate this scenario against the backdrop of repeated US and European threats to impose dramatic economic costs on him for an attack on this scale. The Russian approach laid out in this scenario would thus likely aim at breaking the will of the Europeans and especially the Germans to support any such dramatic economic actions by the United States. Putin would be deploying the fear of catastrophic reductions in energy flows during a very cold winter, fear of an ever-escalating war that could end with the full occupation of Ukraine, and messaging about how Western-encouraged Ukrainian adventurism caused the entire conflict to pressure European governments.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States can attempt to mitigate that problem by making clear to Putin that it will adopt devastating economic countermeasures on its own if necessary, and even at the expense of seriously straining relations with Germany.  
&gt;

&gt;Putin would likely try to use his tremendous leverage on the United States by withholding or threatening to withhold energy supplies to Europe—or threatening other actions—if the United States imposes or retains harsh economic measures in response to this scenario. European fears of that threat and of the economic consequences to Europe of devastating US sanctions on Russia would also advance Russia’s efforts to split the NATO alliance, which is why the Biden Administration has been very careful to try to remain in lock-step with its NATO partners.The United States would naturally need to increase its own and others’ gas supplies to Europe to offset the loss of Russian supplies to the greatest possible extent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The danger this scenario poses to the United States is **precisely the degree** to which Putin can turn it so that nearly the **full weight of any American response rests on Germany**. If Berlin demonstrates that it will not bear that weight and the United States shows that it is unwilling to let **Germany be crushed by it**, then future Russian aggressions are certain. Worse still, the United States will have lost the credible ability to use economic leverage as a deterrent and will be left in the future to choose between war or further surrender. The United States must confront that reality now and **must force Berlin (and Paris) to face it as well.**

The West and Russia have a long history messing with the internal problems of other countries, favouring those under their wing. But even if Maidan's revolution was an external job, is not like Russia has held the power in Ukraine since a long time, just until the revolution. Even if you think that there isn't democracy after, something I completely disagree, absolutely there was not democracy before the revolution, and so pro-Russian governments never had anything similar to democratic legitimacy. So Ukrainians may have changed to a democracy or only changed the leash, but absolutely that they were completely dominated before.

The second concept is ""You cannot change borders of countries except through democratic ways"". This means no conquest, no illegal referendum and no nothing. Here, Russia first invaded Ukraine through the ""little green men"", russian contract soldiers that fought under Russian budget for the independence (there are multiple sources of this, direct and indirect) of the self-proclamed republics. Also Russia has tried to destabilise other western countries with these means (like Catalonia and the promise of even military support in the event of an independence from Spain). And Russia has completely broke this law, making expansionism and provoking internal population movements to solidify its power in the Donbas region, following the Stalin's way of repopulate regions and, like this, ""russificate"" them. 

Even if Ukraine is not a democracy (that is), even if Maidan's revolution was just a coup organized by the US (that was not), Russia is guilty of this war because they made the first move trying to secede a region from a country for their own interests, starting a bloody war just to keep the water flowing to Crimea after Ukrainians threatened to cut it after the attack, to the point of taking off the mask and trying to absorb Donbas even without a false referendum.
