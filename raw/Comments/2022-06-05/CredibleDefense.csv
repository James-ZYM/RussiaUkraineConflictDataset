So now we're talking about two different offensives. First, an air campaign to destroy Ukrainian air defense network. Then another to destroy Ukraine power infrastructure and transportation nodes, namely bridges, to interdict logistics to eastern Ukraine. 

Neither would be easy for the US (at least haven't in the past), I think its a very tall task for the Russians, whose air force has never come close to American capabilities. Especially since if the Russians have success with that then the response is Ukraine being flooded with NATO ADA. 

I don't proclaim to be an expert on modern air warfare but I know enough to believe that the Russians probably can't rely on air power to play a major role in this conflict. I think they can help, but they are never going to be a solution like air power is for the US. But that is unique, the US not only invested in Air Power more heavily than anyone else since even before WW2, but American military political decision making has weighed heavily in the favor of Strategic Air Power to not just support strategic victory but to outright win our nation's wars without even needing ground troops, which is the essence of Air Power. 

Neither the Soviet Union or modern Russia has ever believed that to be true, nor pursued it as a goal. Which now affects decision making, doctrine, and capabilities that will limit their ability to pull off impressive air campaigns in Ukraine. 

That said, even taking out the occasional bridge in Ukraine can hinder them.

* Ukrainian counterattacks in Severodonetsk recaptured large parts of the city and forced Russian troops out of the southern suburbs of the city.  

* Russian forces continued efforts to converge on Slovyansk from the southeast of Izyum and west of Lyman but remain unlikely to make notable advances around Slovyansk due to their continued prioritization of Severodonetsk.  

* Ukrainian troops reportedly conducted limited and localized counterattacks north of Kharkiv City.  

* Russian forces continued to hold their defensive lines and fire at Ukrainian positions along the Southern Axis.

Some different approaches under the sun: 

1 - Tell the world and Putin that the US will not militarily intervene, the military option is fully off the table. Make sure to make it perfectly clear in to the reporters you speak to that you are not risking WW3 over Ukraine. 

2 - Tell the world and Putin nothing about US intentions if an invasion occurs. On one hand you don't placate the Americans and our allies who want to know, but on the other hand the lack of a public announcement leaves Putin and the Russians in the dark, they have to guess and there will be more doubts. 

3 - Tell the world and Putin that US will not allow it and the military solution will remain on the table. This can dramatically increase tensions and raise the chances of WW3 starting over Ukraine if the Russians do it anyway. But now Putin and every Russia has to consider the risk of calling Biden's bluff. He might just be bluffing. But what if he isn't? 

All these different approaches have pros and cons. Option 3 definitely stops the war but is very dangerous. Option 2 is probably the best, nothing lost and nothing gained, but there is likely enough doubt that Putin balks.  

But Option 1, which is what Biden did for months, totally reinforced the idea to Putin (and much of the world) that there was no threat of American military intervention should he invade Ukraine. That would been a massive weight off his shoulders and any others pressing for the invasion. At that point they only needed to worry about sanctions, which they wrongly believed were going to be light enough that their ""war chest"" funds would be enough to keep them solvent. 

Even now historians still argue about April Glaspie's role in possibly giving Saddam Hussein the impression the US didn't care if he invaded Kuwait and accidentally ""green lighting"" the invasion. At a minimum, there needs to be an equally if not larger discussion over Biden's political choices.

The BDD appliqué armour package brings the frontal armour to nearly equivalent to the early T-64A and T-72 Ural and consists of an appliqué plate on the glacis and two horseshoe shaped blocks fitted to the front of the turret. This armour should be proof against all 84mm and 90mm tank gun rounds at all ranges, 105mm APDS and HEAT, 84mm and 106mm recoilless rifle HEAT rounds and many 1st generation anti-tank missiles as well as the M72A3 LAW and RPG-7. The handrails around the turret have been removed to make space for the bra appliqué armour. Fastenings for four spare track chain links have been added on the side of the turret. The tank is fitted with RhKM tracks from the T-72 main battle tank and two additional shock absorbers on the first pair of road wheels. The ""Volna"" fire control system was improved by fitting the KTD-2 (or KTD-1) laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the main armament. There is a new TShSM-41U gunner's sight, new commander's sight, ""Meteor-M1"" stabiliser, BV-62 ballistic computer and 9K116-2 ""Sheksna"" (NATO: AT-10 Stabber) guided missile unit with 1K13-BOM sight (it is both a night sight and ATGM launcher sight.

The ammunition load was increased by two rounds. Some are fitted with two clusters of four smoke grenade launchers each on the right rear of the turret.

Leadership is supposed to be on the front lines, just not all the time. Not only to do things like address problems but also basic battlefield circulation to see the ground for themselves, visit their troops and see how they're doing, judge conditions and see the realities themselves. 

These guys don't show up alone, they travel with entourages. They usually have some level of announcement with messages sent to subordinates to expect them at certain times (as the senior commanders will want briefings, tours, etc). They might also toss in some administrative duties like handing out some awards while they're there (which means those individuals to be awarded need to be present). He might want to visit a local field hospital. Etc. 

It doesn't require modern tech to find those, those had been regularly found and targeted since WW2 by a host of means. However, modern tech does make it a lot easier. Especially when one considers what the UAF has access to in terms of actionable intelligence either their own or whatever NATO is providing them. 

That is the essence of modern warfare and Precision Strike doctrine, modern tech opens up new doors never before fully exploitable, and we're seeing it being used in Ukraine. Technologically advanced ISR and SIGINT assets allow them to find targets that previously were very difficult to find, down to a 1 meter grid coordinate location. With technologically advanced communications systems it allows near instantaneous secure transmissions of messages, to include sending digital photos and videos, not just text. And with technologically advanced accurate and responsive fires they can destroy those precise locations at will, 24/7, with very short notice warning. All of that creates abilities that in past conflicts were either much more difficult or next to impossible to achieve.

I believe this is a misunderstanding of Roman law. The ancient Roman commanders had imperium, in fact, absolute imperium. All Roman official have imperium but depending on their ranks some would overwrite other's command. The consul would overwrite the aedile and praetor. But as the leading leader of the Roman state in a location with imperium and the fasces, the official would absolutely be able to administer legal punishment on **any civilian** with a trial [while leading citizens who can afford lawyers likely prevail]. And in time of crisis without a trial.

Now these kind of punishments specifically state are quite rare, I don't think ""disobedience, carelessness"" are part of it. I think that need to be elaborated. Disobedience to military ""law"" three times? Carelessness and slip from your sentey post? 

But in any case, these instances are rare by the time of the late republic, with Crassus' punishment often said to be archaic. But, as leading official in their field with legal imperium, they absolutely can punish soldiers to death. However as Plutarch noted, *Crassus gave Mummius himself a rough reception* while had 500 of his men killed in horrible public measures.

But is there a military law?

Of course. It's the *ius militares*. Acts against it is called *delicta militium*, from the bad like breaking military trust *fidas* to things like sloth. The punishment can be physical labor to death.


So, there is military law, there is legal authority to exercise said military law via the people who grant him said powers, and the punishment lies in the hand of those who wield imperium. 

I'm not too sure if the Romans continued to have military trials, I assume they merely continued the tradition from the time of kingdoms.

In 472BC, Livy told us that Appius Claudius after defeat, orderes a council to be set up,  and cursed the soldiers for abandoning the field. And then he had the cowards draw lots and killed 1/10.

The quoted text made it seem as if soldiers had no rights and any litttle thing could get them killed. But there is a military law, and there is military discipline, and the Romans could not have conquered so much by killing their soldiers for carelessness in the casual usage.",15a7cf3f951b48c9dfd74ff7b874f5a1097049fe,True,False,,,,,0,1654459978,,0,{},ibaelr7,False,t3_v5cvx0,False,True,t1_ib8z1hq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v5cvx0/the_military_step_theorizing_the_mobilization_of/ibaelr7/,1654459990,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654431178.0

One of the scariest things about the war for me is that I have no idea what happens if Putin nukes Kyiv, and I think that means Putin isn't 100% sure what happens if he nukes Kyiv.

I don't find it particularly likely.  I think there has been a lot of nuclear scaremongering that isn't very interesting.  But back in the Cold War, it was super clear that if the nukes started flying, that was it.  That was endgame.  There was clarity.  Today, I think there's reason to doubt that Biden would end the world if Russia nukes Kyiv.  Nixon was a shithead, but I basically believe that he was 100% willing to push the button.  And I think that Soviet leadership in the 70's estimated that Nixon was 100% willing to push the button.  In that scenario, you know you can't com out ahead by using a nuke, so nobody seriously considers using a nuke.

When there's ambiguity, Putin might think he can come out ahead with a nuke.

So they would realistically have needed to be drafting people even before the end of 2021 in order to get them all to the battlefield by early 2022.  Because in the actual historical events, the 2022 invasion force was probably as big as they could bring to bear in that time frame.

If you see Oliver stones interview with putin you can see how insistent putin is on wanting “Minsk amnesty to be fulfilled” basically to get his agents in the Ukraine parliament, including the warlords rapists and criminals he elevated who served alongside Russian echelons. He wanted them to be given total amnesty and be allowed to control the Ukrainians destiny from within.

I specifically remember I think in maybe 2020 or maybe it was 2021?

The Russians were alarmed at the Ukrainians successfully using drones, I think it may have been baryaktars even on the forces in donbass and it alarmed them because it was a sign of how much stronger and stronger Ukraine was becoming. I remember and article about it showing their anger.

Definitely feels like between that and Ukraine rotating combat troops into donbass for years made Ukraine have an advantage in the long game from the frozen situation.

It’s incredible that putin counted his chickens early by vapourising many of the original local “separatists” that had some legitimacy and name.

First mozgovoy was killed early on when he got too big for his boots ( the one in the vice Russian roulette talking about arresting women for being in a cafe alone).

Then Motorola was killed with a thermobaric bomb.

Then givi killed with a tthermobaric bomb planted in his office.

Then zakharchenko with a thermobaric bomb planted in a cafe just weeks later.

Not only does that vastly increase the intelligence pool in the Age of Information, but it allows the West to maintain a more robust, more resilient global trade network in times of crisis. If shit hits the fan in any real sense, China is not going to be able to shore up every single production pipeline for every single component that is necessary to maintain the same level of innovation that they see right now, let alone increasing that bottom line when post-industrialized nations already tend to slow down in growth unless heavily invest. Considering the CCP has purged all dissent or disruption over the last 5-10 years, I would hardly say they’ve “invested” intellectually.

Second, I’d like to state that “China has already moved to a new-age army” is kinda true, but the Russians have been “cutting edge” for decades. The modern Chinese military, as well as all of its equipment, is entirely unproven on the battlefield. It took them more than a decade to clone the F-22 and it barely competes with the F-35, and is not being sold, whereas the F-35 is being exported to just about any country that can afford it. Wartime innovation is a much quicker game. The Chinese can’t keep up against the combined brainpower of the West without copying the answers with cheaper mats.

Lastly, I also cannot stress this enough. Their economy is built entirely on govt-sponsored debt. It is an increasingly volatile, short-term growth system, but now that much of their cheap manufacturing work has migrated south to other countries, they do not have any other market share to feed to that system and it is starving and sooner or later it will eat the CCP alive. Authoritarian regimes struggle in global economic disruptions and China is already seeing breakdowns in its major industries.

One can say things would definitely be better under Biden but also be extremely pro Ukrainian and wish we had given everything we have given now 2+ months ago as it would have crushed the Russians. They were very vulnerable as they were reforming and kicking their wounds.

This made agriculture prosperous, army recruitment easy, and the collection of taxes straightforward. From 150 to 450, the climate entered a transitional period, in which taxes were less easy to collect and bore more heavily on the working population. After about 450, the climate worsened further in the Late Antique Little Ice Age that may have directly contributed to the variety of factors that brought Rome down.[20] The Roman Empire was built on the fringes of the tropics.

Even after the the code breaking was revealed, the story was incorrect in large parts until the **Shattered Sword** decided to do a deep dive into Japanese primary sources and learned that the ""story of midway"" relied heavily on a few Japanese sources who had a history of dishonesty.  

One glaring example was the ""bad luck"" hypothesis that relied on the idea that the Kido Butai was attacked just a few minutes before they were to launch their own strike, when they were at least 90 minutes away from doing so.  

Japanese carriers never spotted strikes on the deck, they were done in the hangers, so the ""decks full of fueled and armed planes"" myth was impossible.  

Additionally, Japanese doctrine prevented spotting a strike while under attack because each carrier was tasked with providing its own CAP aircraft and the Zero's low ammunition capacity meant that planes were constantly landing to be re-armed and refueled.  Carriers of the time simply couldn't recover (and realistically couldn't launch) aircraft while a strike was on deck.  In 1942, Japanese doctrine simply didn't allow Nagumo to decide ""all of Soryu's zeros will be used for CAP, other carriers will prepare a strike.""  This doctrinal failure really screwed the Japanese because they were under attack from Midway based aircraft for most of the morning and never had time to spot a strike once those attacks started.

Another doctrinal failure was the aversion to piecemeal attacks.  The Kido Butai generally only launched coordinated attacks from multiple decks, so Nagumo couldn't say ""have all the returning planes land on Akagi and Hiryu and launch strikes from Kaga and Soryu,"" the Japanese just weren't trained to do that.",33a9ea961f9d06bd7593266895b087efed2e4907,True,False,,,,,0,1654441107,,0,{},ib9b1pi,False,t3_v5bwaa,False,True,t1_ib95z2e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v5bwaa/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_05_2022/ib9b1pi/,1654441123,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654412307.0

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the thought process, but hasn't this happened before? I.e., the transfer of extremely powerful weaponry that can hamper an adversary's war effort? It really isn't a tit for tat as it has mostly just been America funding adversaries and not the other way(minus Iran in Iraq).

Operation Cyclone, the CIA's project in Afghanistan in the 1980s, gave the Afghans Stingers and other anti-aircraft weapons that definitely hurt the Soviets.

Relations were good between the US and Russia during the 2000s when Iraq and Afghan was popping off, so Russia didn't have any need or want to ship or have advanced weapons conveniently fall off the back of a truck and be used to shoot at the Coalition.

To be honest, with how low relations between the US and Russia have been since 2014, especially with the ""Bountygate"" that turned out to be false, I'm surprised Russia didn't send the Taliban or whatever Iraqi groups some RPG-29s or something.

Maybe it is just a lack of will, or capability, but enemies sending weapons that can be used to hurt Americans hasn't really proven true, since Vietnam I guess?

Sure, if America gets into any more adventures in the Middle East or Africa soon, there may be some suspiciously Russian weapons there. But that is kind of a question for the future, and diplomacy can always bribe or threaten Russia to not send weapons.

You don't back dictators into a corner unless you have no other options because most dictators would rather risk seeing their country destroyed than take actions that diminish their power.  Self preservation is a powerful motivator.  I could name dozens of dictators who have been willing to destroy their own countries rather than give up power.

If Biden or anyone else backs Putin into a corner, there are few realistic outcomes.  The most dangerous, yet very possible outcome is that Putin escalates the conflict and the risk of nuclear war is dramatically ramped up.  This is simply unacceptable.  There are no rational scenarios where Ukraine is worth risking either a limited or total nuclear exchange that sets mankind back a few centuries.  

Second, I'm no Biden fan, but his administration played the Russian buildup perfectly and the outcome was - by far - the best one could have reasonably hoped for.

This administration absolutely destroyed Russia on the diplomatic stage, putting on a master class in Geopolitics, diplomacy, and unity building. The idea of a united EU/NATO supporting Ukraine was unlikely 12 months ago. The idea that these countries would enact serious sanctions against Russia, provide significant military support, and hurt their own economies to cut off Russian energy sales was laughable 12 months ago. So how did that happen? The classic ""give your opponent the rope and let them hang themselves with it.""

The Biden administration, understood that they would have to climb a tall mountain and organize a coalition of countries that were sacrificing their short term interests to unite against Russian aggression.  They knew they couldn't do that unless they played the cards correctly.  They slow walked the intelligence they obtained about the war in the months and weeks prior. First quietly, then publicly.  They showed pictures of the buildup and backed that up with intelligence.

This forced Russia to not only deny the claims publicly - calling the administration all sorts of names - but more importantly, Russian diplomats were lying to other countries throughout the world.

In every embassy and consulate, Russian diplomats were asked whether the intelligence was real, whether Russia would invade Ukraine. They said no, meaning they were either lying or they were lied to. In either case, it became crystal clear that Russia could no longer be trusted. Losing trust is a huge thing in diplomatic circles because so much of diplomacy relies on trusting another diplomat's word.

Meanwhile, US diplomats were in those same embassies and consulates securing promises: ""yeah, I know they said they wouldn't invade, and I know you told them there would be consequences if they did, but lets talk about what those consequences should be. Here is what we propose."" It is always easier to get an agreement to the hypothetical rather than the actual situation.

Russia then triggered those agreements by invading, shortly after they said they wouldn't.  The result is that they are losing and will ultimately lose, now the only question is how bad.  Their economy has been set back a ***minimum*** of 5 years, and likely 10-15 years as the sanctions will continue to bite, even if they're all withdrawn tomorrow.  Even taking the entirety of Ukraine would not have been worth the economic consequences, let alone the loss of life and equipment.

I really agree with your comment on the other recently closed thread:

“Mobilization has long delays, and none of the options are great:

•	⁠if Russia mobilized Feb 24, and tried to create at least somewhat effective military units, first one would be heading to battle about now; Russia would have much better long war perspectives



•	⁠if Russia mobilized Feb 24, and sent them as cannon fodder with barely any knowledge which end of AK74 is the shooty end (this is current Russian policy), it wouldn't change outcome of the war really; what Russia could do is put its cannon fodder soldiers in occupied North Ukraine to keep occupation going (and suffer massive daily losses like in March), instead of withdrawing - Ukrainians would need to spend a lot of resources pushing even shitty reserves out of Kyiv and breaking siege of Chernihiv, Sumy etc. - and that means Ukrainians could spend less on the main frontline


•	⁠if Russia mobilized mid-late 2021, with intention of attacking Feb 24, that would be extremely obvious and it would give West and Ukraine 3-6 months to prepare the answer. *Worst case scenario for Russia is US putting a few hundred tripwire troops on the border and Russia having to cancel mobilization and not go to war, as even in copium delirium Russia knows it can't go to war with US”**


Like imagine if Biden had simply not telegraphed total. Dove signals again and again and stated months out, after the horribly Afghanistan withdrawal that “we will not use American soldiers”

Imagine if in regards to the American soldiers Biden had simply said “well Russia says they aren’t going to invade so they’re staying put” or better yet, said nothing. It would have taken the initiative and kept Putin guessing.


Anything but just make Putin think “sweet I got the green light just like crimea”

Because with crimea the Obama admin literally told the Ukrainians to do Nothing! Basically said “don’t attack them that would be provocative do nothing and we will negotiate against Russia” screwed them by basically giving lukewarm sanctions and then Europe continued business as usual in regards to gas etc.:

Phillip karber himself said talking to Russians they just laugh like “ sanctions are priced into it, you put sanctions, fine we will just take more then negotiate to remove sanctions after” and we’re seeing just that with them seizing the grain.

With regards to what you said someone said something interesting to me.

Imagine if instead of giving putin hebultainte victory giving him a huge territorial seizure (crimea) for absolutely no cost in terms of blood and stifling the Ukrainians by demanding they not resist.

Imagine if Obama simply said “ok if you say they’re not Russian troops, we will immediately assist the elected Ukrainian government in destroying these terrorist units, with drone strikes and also we are considering sending heavy weapons.

It doesn’t matter not actually planning to do that, it would put actual scare into Putin and have to make him reframe his propaganda.

We never got any creative pushback all we ever got was deliberate and repeated stating of how passionately and transparently we definitely WONT offer any opposition to their actions. That’s what I think emboldened these war aims of putin.

&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday we received a lot of questions from various sides about the Ukrop counterattack in Severodonetsk.
&gt; What is going on and whether it is happening at all? Is it a miracle or a big trouble?
&gt; 
&gt; My dears, when and if I, God forbid, command the 2nd AC of the LNR militia, you will be the first to know everything.
&gt; But, hopefully, the staffing crisis will not reach such Homeric proportions.
&gt; 
&gt; Just because I am in the LNR does not mean that I know all the soldiers of the Republic by name and constantly keep my hand on the pulse of all movements throughout the LNR. When I know something for sure, and it is not a military secret, I will tell/write.
&gt; 
&gt; I know the situation in Severodonetsk in general terms as of the morning of June 2.
&gt; 
&gt; The city, which had already been declared taken, like Volnovakha, had not yet been mopped up at that time. In addition to the industrial zone, there were still several residential areas under the control of the AFU. Not many anymore, but there were.
&gt; 
&gt; The battles for the city were fought by the 2nd and 7th brigades of the LNR militia with attached units, including units of mobilized Luhansk residents and Chechen Rosgvardia, as well as, I understand, with units of the corps subordinate to the 2nd AC of the LNR militia. There is a lot of talk about the Chechens, how useless they are as selfies troops, and I think this topic demands a separate post, but for now I will say that the question of interaction with the Chechens seems to have been solved in the 7th Army - how to properly integrate them into the military machine so that their keen desire to shoot with whatever they have with them turned out to be relevant and useful. In reports from Severodonetsk the commanders of the groups are covered with walkie-talkies for a reason. It is not for the sake of showing off - it is communication with the neighbors, with the superiors, with the attached forces, with the artillery. Since most of this communication is off-standard and in some places trophy communication. A freaking madhouse.
&gt; 
&gt; I will not say anything about the ""two"", but the ""seven"" in general terms have learned the bloody lessons of Rubizhne. No one is driven forward, into the firing pockets when their flanks are lagging behind. The command, hurrying up the troops, seeks to align the front line more often, so as not to give the Ukropians convenient places to counterattack. We simply do not have enough infantry to squander men any more.
&gt; 
&gt; Our artillery works very well at times - it is the effect of well-established observation of the enemy and communications, including surveillance from the air. Alas, as of the morning of June 2, we were unable to completely destroy the only remaining bridge to the city, which runs from Lysychansk, and the artillery is trying to cut off traffic on it, but it does not always succeed.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, the main question about the success of the ""foreign mercenary counterattack"" is whether the Ukrops were able to covertly move enough fresh forces across the river and concentrate them in one place. Radio suppression in the 2nd AK may not be mega-successful, but SIGINT is good. If the guys turned on their Motorolas before they got across the river, got to their initial positions and went on the attack, then surprises for them could have started right from the start. Which, of course, does not preclude local success. If the foreign guests and the Ukrainian senior commanders, who introduced them into the battle, did everything right, then the local success of the guests is practically guaranteed, and the news will be able to tell a couple more times that Severodonetsk is the part of Ukraine. And then the "" Zmey Gorynych"" will arrive. Almost a ton and a half of plastic that will fly in and demolish buildings, and they don't care how much your biker boots cost or how tacticool your equipment is. This isn't strikeball, this is war. Rubizhne, as I wrote, ended after 17 launches of the UR-77 and UR-83P at heavily fortified strongholds.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, the Tulips. I hope the guests were warned that they are going into the coverage of these beautiful 240-mm self-propelled mortars, sung by Divov in ""The Weapon of Vengeance. Otherwise it would be awkward, like with those who have not been warned that a cruise missile might come.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, if the ""guests"" do everything right at all, they will be able to achieve a nice local success, take back a few blocks, push through the front in the city, maybe even take prisoners, using the effect of surprise. If after that they don't disperse in time, they'll get beaten up. If they made a mistake at the start, and especially if the ""mercenaries"" were recruited from different places and had not been combat-coordinated, they may have already gone back with an incomplete squad. The question of securing a possible local success will be a question of the accuracy of their interaction with the Ukrainian artillery and the availability of the ammunition. Again, as of the morning of June 2, the Ukrainian artillery had it in that area.
&gt; 
&gt; We will wait for reliable information.
&gt; 
&gt; It has been said a hundred times already - our enemy is resourceful and persistent. He will counterattack, snap back, drink more of our blood. Whoever doesn't get it right the first time will continue to lose people foolishly.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yes, the enemy was brave - the greater our glory"" (c) Konstantin Simonov.
&gt; 
&gt; If the higher echelons of the military command do not learn the bloody lessons of the first months of the war, we will lose it. The Luhansk infantry are people who are already used to carry out the impossible, but if there are no people, there is no one to carry it out.",98a405b202b4a311a7a68be1db288214b54f6570,True,False,,,,,0,1654435312,,0,{},ib90bua,False,t3_v5bwaa,False,True,t3_v5bwaa,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v5bwaa/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_05_2022/ib90bua/,1654435328,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654406512.0

ABSTRACT 

This article considers the dynamic relationship between the soldier, the army, and the warzone, using contemporary philosophy and military theory to frame a reading of Roman sources. I will discuss how Roman literature reveals geographic space to be transformed by military activity, and likewise how this space and the soldier’s func- tioning in it synchronously makes the soldier’s body military, specifi- cally Roman military. The aim is to utilize examples from ancient warfare to reflect on issues of de- and reterritorialization, in modern critical military studies. I will explore how the soldierly body both constructs and is constructed by the space in which it moves. 


&gt; * Therefore, a considera- tion of Roman, as much as modern, military geography ought to include environmen- tal, technological and corporeal factors. 

&gt; * The ubiquitous description of the Roman armed forces as a ‘machine’ (Peddie 1994; Nicolet 1980, 90; compare Mattern 2009, 127) should not be readily dismissed as cliché: during the Republican period alone, the territorial space of the Roman state expanded from a tiny portion of the Italian peninsula to roughly five million square kilometres across Europe and North Africa 

&gt; * The review of Roman sources in this article therefore has at its philosophical heart this perception of the army as a state-operated territorializing machine – a force mobilized for the safe- guarding of sovereignty and the continuance of government power. 

&gt; * In fact, Cicero, a contemporary of Caesar, condemns the general’s attitude to warfare as a turning point for Roman expansionism, stating, ‘It always used to be the policy of our generals to keep these peoples at bay and avoid aggression. . .. But Caesar’s policy has, I observe, been quite different . . . he wanted the whole of Gaul forced to recognise our sovereignty’ (On the Consular Provinces, 32, translated in Sabben-Clare 1971). Cicero here makes clear the displacement of one state stratification for another, within the geo-political boundaries of (former) Gallic terri- tory. The Gauls’ strategy of retaliation seems clear: prevent the land from being reterritorialized as Roman. 

&gt; * It is this dynamic relationship between military landscape and body which will now be explored, by paralleling the territor- ializing effects of Roman military mobilization on environment with the effects on the soldierly body, which, as MacLeish suggests, is just as much an ‘object of state violence’ as its agent. 

&gt; * The success of the Roman state in its expansion might at least partly be attributed to the dogma of military might and conquest which pervaded Roman culture, namely the collective normalization of military violence as the means to both citizenship and masculinity (Alston 2010, 205; Chidwick 2017). Young Roman males were raised surrounded by reminders of their ancestors’ victories, which ideologically prepared them for entry into military service at 17 (Keith 2000, 19; McDonnell 2006, 177–8). It could be argued that simply by participating in the structural, performative codes of the Roman socio-political terrain, Romans were by nature also soldiers (an identity they were arguably forced to adopt during the civil wars; Roller 1996). Various accounts suggest that in the second century BC more than half of Roman citizens served for at least seven years in the army and, as the empire expanded, war became a profession upon which hinged the stability of the state (Coker 2002, 39–40). 

&gt; * The result was a mixed national corps, all bracketed as ‘Roman’, but who may not have been raised with the same pervading military interest as the supposed ‘citizens’ militia’. 

&gt; * Rather, it was conduct on campaign that made a soldier, and this facet makes Roman military practice particularly pertinent to an argument which concerns the reflexive territor- ializing effect of military mobilization. 

&gt; * ‘The military body ... represents the transformation of men and women into tools. It is a body instrumentalised via discipline and control’. The Roman literary canon reveals that this conceptualization of the soldierly body as a component part, which must function properly in order for the territorializing machine to work, is not confined to recent discourse. 

&gt; * …soldiers became synonymous with their caligae, ‘marching boots’, another Roman nickname for legionaries (caligati, see Phang 2008, 17; Pliny, Natural Histories, 7) echoing modern slang, ‘boot’, for an inexperienced soldier. The Romans’ marching in these boots reterritorialized their bodies as well as the ground they covered, making the military step more than just a means of transporting the army from one location to another, but key to the construction of military territory, overall. 

&gt; * As such, the correct pace was necessarily a quotidian practice: ‘at the military step twenty miles should be covered in five hours’, while ‘at the full step, which is faster, twenty-four miles should be covered in the same time’…

&gt; * This movement generated a uniform muscular memory worthy of the synecdochic Latin word, miles, which translates into English as both ‘soldier’ and ‘army’. ‘The relationship to space of a “subject” who is a member of a group or society’, writes Lefebvre (2009, translated by Nicholson-Smith, 40), ‘implies his relationship to his own body and vice versa’. The functioning of the soldier’s body and, importantly, his self-perception were reciprocally determined by his activity as a ‘member’ of the Roman army, whether on the march, in the camp, or in the mêlée. 

&gt; * Any refusal to uphold the rigid structure of the military machine would likely result in the punishment of fustuarium (‘beating to death’, see Polybius, 6.37; Ward 2017, 304), exacted for disobedience, carelessness, and desertion – a punishment which makes brutally clear the soldiers’ bodily rights versus those of the (elite) citizen…

&gt; * Despite the centrality of war in Roman culture, the murder of humans was still criminal and hardly habitual. Therefore, ‘Roman military training sought to overcome the natural fear of cold steel and inhibition toward killing at close range’ (Phang 2008, 42). 

&gt; * In short, constant practice of military movement was specifically designed to render professional soldiers better at killing than dying (Coker 2002, 26). 

&gt; * A theme consistent in the ancient and modern sources included in this article is that, in their ‘national’ service, the army carried Rome with it by extending and preserving the ager Romanus and, therefore, Roman civilization. This re-production of Rome is represented exemplarily in the daily con- and destruction of the military camp (cas- trorum metatio) 

&gt; * …the rapid and violent expansion of the Roman empire was accomplished through the reterritorialization of geographical terrain and, likewise, of bodies and identities. Yet this reterritorialization did not generate perfectly ‘Roman’ simulacra, but rather a synthetic, mass-produced military mutation which purported the illusion, and enforced the sovereignty, of Romanness. 

&gt; * …this article has aimed to show how the theoretical impetus behind many of these praxes can be read as continuing to underpin military mobiliza- tion in the twenty-first century. 

&gt; * The traces of militarization do not confine themselves to the ground, but also infiltrate the boots marching upon it. ‘Power produces’, asserts Foucault (1991, translated by Lane, 194); ‘it produces reality...’. Military might pro- duces militarized territory; it leaves an insignia, and ‘Nothing disappears completely . . .. In space, what came earlier continues to underpin what follows’ (Lefebvre 2009, translated by Nicholson-Smith, 229).",07ded7ac07b74cce85d4e91f81380eec00b867af,True,False,,,,,0,1654434538,,0,{},ib8z1hq,True,t3_v5cvx0,False,True,t3_v5cvx0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v5cvx0/the_military_step_theorizing_the_mobilization_of/ib8z1hq/,1654434550,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654405738.0

As a person who lives with electronic component shortages on a day to day basis, there was no way the Russian companies could have stockpiled electronic chips even if they had known about the impending action. Most of the chips in the supply pipeline dried up due to lack of production due to early pandemic shut downs, then when the economies came back roaring, many companies placed 18 months worth of PO’s in 12 months thus creating backlogs and past dues. 

Further the demand itself changed with a lot more industries going I4.0/automation compared the pre pandemic. Hence a lot chip manufactures placed chips on allocations. 

So if company XYZ was buying 10,000 ABC microchips annually prior to the pandemic, and now has a demand of 20,000, the allocation will be 1500 every quarter adding upto  6,000 instead of the 20,000 demanded. Either you substitute or redesign for the rest of the 14,000 requirements or just forgo the business. I have done both. 

Given how Russian economy is, the intense need to substitute and build a pipeline of chips or redesign may not have been as acute as it was in the US. So they were caught with their pants down. Now they can’t even substitute and redesign with cheap Chinese chips which I’ve been doing lately because even China will not supply them, they are toast. If it happened to me, my company of $20B in revenue will stop producing in almost the entire product lines and we will go bankrupt in 3 months.",ba9995e8853dca1d2f12c2016ff540cf700c8026,True,False,,,,,0,1654429958,,0,{},ib8s8mc,False,t3_v4twqt,False,True,t3_v4twqt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4twqt/can_russia_rebuild_its_tech_sector_with_chinas/ib8s8mc/,1654429976,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654401158.0

Hell the UK recently made it policy that they will never look into war crimes in northern ireland and soldiers are immune to prosecution. Same old shit tbh.

All you have to do is look at the yugoslav tribunal. NATO provided as much evidence as they could on the other side committing crimes, but witheld information/ scuppered inquiries on their own activities and the US actively pressured the prosecutors not to even look into anything the kosovans or we did. Hell the US forced serbia to illegally extradite milosevic.

&gt; India's present stance in this conflict isn't likely to change future weapon acquisitions from the West. If anything they will continue to increase and India will continue to increase their domestic abilities. The West will continue offering weapons to India as they are the balance against China's growing military powers.

I think you have it backwards. 

What India does now will not impact what they can buy from Russia. Russia was desperate for cash before all of this, after they will not be in a position to say no to India no matter what. But it will impact their relationship with the western block. With Russia in a rapid decline, and NATO unified, expanded and re-invigorated, they will exit this conflict with more bargaining power than they entered. 

Domestic industry is great. But it's not quick, and India is a very long way from being able to make a 5th or 6th gen fighter. India needs to maintain a modern air force, and domestic versions will not be ready in time.

They have a set of targeting parameters which they’ve fulfilled and are capable of independently making decisions (such as the direction of their fins, mostly) in order to achieve a kill.

It will be gradual, likelier than not. Missiles will achieve more intelligent targeting parameters, drones may have a short period where they loiter in the presence of known enemy forces. Targeting parameters for everything will continue to get more and more intelligent, which will then allow munitions to become more and more independent.

China may be 1-2 generations behind TSMC and Intel, but they are going to stay miles ahead of what your suggested Ru/NK/Iran bloc could manufacture internally.  The Russia+ bloc simply isn't a very large market.  There's not remotely enough of a customer base to fund a competitive R&amp;D base.  And the size of the customer base pretty much dictates the R&amp;D funding, which dictates the rate of advancement.  So Russia just gets further behind, and makes a less desirable product every year, further strangling the potential customer base.

I am reminded of an article I read about the Soyuz clocks made during the Soviet period:  http://www.righto.com/2020/01/inside-digital-clock-from-soyuz.html

This is how competitive Soviet tech was with the West, when they had the whole USSR and Communist world funding their R&amp;D.  At the time the USSR could build a clock with 100 of their best IC's and ten circuit boards, home computer companies like Apple were making whole computers with half as many chips on one or two boards that run a complete GUI operating system.  The bleeding edge for the USSR was basically what the US had used in the 1960's for the Apollo program.  Russia under sanctions is in a much less favorable position for tech development than the USSR was in the 1980's.

People really underestimate just how many people modern global tech companies interact with today.  Apple is an ""American company"" but their revenues don't come from 300M people in the US.  They come from billions of people globally.  Apple has so much cash on hand, it could do a project that matched the entire Russian military budget for years, without impacting operations in the slightest or needing any additional revenue.  The Russian nation state can't remotely compete with global megacorporations that have hundreds of billions of dollars just sitting around waiting for interesting R&amp;D projects.

Cities in the US are generally in notoriously bad financial situations. You can fund them through debt and through money paid into the city for new developments, and then money runs out and the city goes bankrupt. Happens all the time.

Key Takeaways

Ukrainian forces conducted successful local counterattacks in Severodonetsk and Russian progress in direct assaults on the city and wider operations to encircle it remain slow. Ukrainian defenses in eastern Ukraine remain effective.

Russian forces launched a series of unsuccessful offensive operations southwest of Izyum and in the Lyman area.

Russian forces continued to defend previously occupied positions around Kharkiv City and launched missile and artillery strikes against Ukrainian defenders.

Russian forces did not attempt to launch assaults on settlements in Kherson and Zaporizhia Oblast but continued to fire at Ukrainian positions throughout southern Ukraine.

The Kremlin faces rising partisan activity in southern Ukraine despite Russian efforts to restrict movement and telecommunications access.

Ukrainian officials are continuing negotiations for a prisoner exchange of the captured Mariupol defenders.",b8de8af9de4857340f6b79de6c98ff1070b4dd3a,True,False,,,,,0,1654388390,,0,{},ib77hrn,False,t3_v4neox,False,True,t3_v4neox,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib77hrn/,1654388403,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654359590.0
