Never generalize. Never. This rule was taught to us by all dictatorship regimes, who seeked for inner or outer enemy. Nazis generalized jews for their ""crimes to be jew"", NKVD generalized peasants and kulaks as 'enemy of worker's class"". Their families were marked with sin, they were told that they're guilty just because they're happen to live in same family with their parents. Tvardovsky in ""By right of memory"" wrote: Son is not responsible for father. The mutual responsibility- probably, ugliest thing in russian society- army, prisons, colleagues -they love to blame group for shit made by few, they force society to personally punish the ""guilty"". This rhetorics is sprouts of totalitarianism and dictatorship.

Putin both idiot and not at the same time. There is no mobilization in Russia, so civilians think  that it does not concern them, that the war is somewhere out there, far away, and, of course, ""only professional soldiers will die"". That is why there is no mobilization, so as not to cause panic among the Russians.

/If they say they are against war, they are not against victory/- you are wrong here. Because sanctions and economical damage will not fade away at the snap of a finger, even if Russia wins.

If only i had these answers, i wouldn't spoke to you here. I do not know how russians could make an overthrow or revolution. Probably, when gas/oil embargo will hit (and they will hit very hard), they could understand the depth of their crisis.

Russians were before Peter, before Ivan IV, but now most of them are mixed to the ""noviop"" state. Homo soveticus, as some say.

Reparations were taken from country, not from nation.

Russians don't rebel now. In future- probably, if they lose this war, but even then there is no guarantee, that they will took over regime.

Russians will be responsible for crimes only if they're commit them. To live in Russia- is still not a crime. You might as well accuse the Americans of killing North Vietnamese citizens.

Do you know what the Russians did next? They condemned the Maidan. The Maidan was made not by the opposition, but by people who fought for their freedom and paid the price.  
And now we look at Russia. Protests where they are beaten, violate citizens' rights and show that no one legally accepts them, they justify by saying that they can do nothing. These are all excuses to deceive empaths like you. Russians are savages and barbarians, and you perceive them as civilized people.  
Aren't Russians afraid to attack and die in Ukraine, to die from the resistance of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the military actions of the regular army defending their land, and are they afraid to come out against Putin, who is guarded by policemen with truncheons? They are dying for their imperial ideals. If they say they are against war, they are not against victory. The Russians themselves must pay for the freedom of the Russians. **And you never answered who should free the Russians from the ""oppression"" of Putin? And how do you imagine it?** And if they still support Putin, it is an invasion of another country. Give me the answers and think about it.  
  
Russians, this is a nation formed under Peter the Great from nomadic tribes. The beginning of her upbringing fell on the ""strong hand"" of the king.

Germany paid reparations and was condemned by the whole world. They were also made to realize what they had done. This is what the Russians should expect after the war. I am not campaigning for the extermination of Russians who are now Nazis, I am in favor of not taking responsibility from them. 

When you listen to the ""good Russians"" (liberals), they are not against the annexation of Crimea, and this is the inevitable support for the invasion. Now they just don't like the format, but they are the same emperors who, by the way, reflect the mood of society. And that's why they are not good Russians. They bring only sorrow. Even these ""good Russians"" tell Ukrainians what to do. They do not work with the sick Russian society, but climb to Ukraine. There is no opposition in Russia because they are consolidated in [their imperial ambitions](https://activegroup.com.ua/2022/03/16/survey-says-86-6-of-russians-support-the-armed-invasion-of-russia-in-other-european-countries/).   
 And that is why they are not rebelling now. They rebel not because they are against the war, but because they cannot cope with the war.
