The sobering reality is that we’re as close as we’ve ever come to nuclear war. Anyone confidently saying we’re not is probably just distancing themselves from that reality to avoid the anxiety of it.

I can’t blame them. Even willful ignorance can be a relief.

I just pray that those with the capacity to steer our societies generally understand the reality we’ve found ourselves in.

This is what I think would happen.  War protestors are few but Putin's war is so incredibly stupid that its impossible for a large proportion of the population to truly support it.  So many Russians have been needlessly slaughtered at the front, sent to die to protect the wealth of Putin and his elite.  How many people really don't get that?
