His big idea is basically that the US will become mostly self reliant in fuel, food and manufactered goods soon and won't see any need to protect global shipping through the Bretton Woods trade agreement, or engage in the world in any of the ways we've become used to over the last century or so and the entire global order will collapse because of that. Countries that have their own supply of the basics of civilisation like food and fuel, or the means to get them, will be okay, countries that don't (which in his veiw will be most of them) will either collapse or face extreme hardships. This is why he thinks China is so doomed; it doesn't have enough fuel to power itself or enough food or fertiliser products to feed its population and because of the security risks of the first island chain, the sheer distance of those things and a war in the Middle East (that he predicts will happen) they'll have trouble importing them.

I think that's very speculative though. It relies on a very specific chain of events. Maybe the US will cease Bretton Woods and maybe the rest of the world won't be able to work out a replacement, and maybe the Middle East will erupt into a war that interupts oil supplies, and maybe China aren't able to source fuel and maybe they can't get it from Russia or US imports and maybe if they can they can't get it through the first island chain, but he's going to have to be right about a whole load of things to get to the end result he's predicting.

To put it in context, back in 2015 he predicted that Russia would launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine by 2022. That sounds impressive but in his predicted war Russia would conquer Ukraine very quickly and would go on to start a major European war in which they'd try to conquer the Baltic states and Poland, and the US would provide only limited help.

Basically the US Navy guarantees global shipping lanes. If the US Navy stops doing that, the Bretton Woods system (we guarantee shipping lanes and you fight with us against communism) collapses and then states or groups of states will have to guarantee that themselves.

The problem is that most countries don't have a very good navy yet their economies are super reliant on global shipping.

One of those countries is China, which is geographically in a bad position. Their navy is not green water capable, they can't even break the first island chain. Yet China are the biggest importers of crude and they also import a lot of foodstuffs. More crude cannot be imported from Russia because Russia doesn't have the tech, money or time to create a new pipeline or to open new wells. That leaves oil from the gulf state.

The problem with that is that in order for tankers to go from the Strait of Hormuz to China, those tankers would have to go through the spheres of influence of India, Malaysia, Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan.

He thinks a famine will kill close to a billion people in places like India and China over the coming few years due to a lack of wheat resulting from the war in Ukraine. He doesn’t mention that countries like India and China don’t eat wheat. They eat rice. India alone exports 1.8 million metric tons of it and most of that is grown completely free of fertilizer or pesticide because India has some of the best agricultural land on the planet. 

It’s important to note that Zeihan isn’t the only one to come out and say that new Chinese data points to a halving of their population by 2050, which is one of the assertions he makes that sounds most radical the first time you hear it. Michael Beckley has said the same thing. I also think it’s important to mention that basically every country that ever held the world reserve currency also concurrently maintained the world’s top naval fleet at the same time. Trade and naval power are intimately connected.

He is basically predicting that increasing US domestic discord will lead to a lack of any real focus in international policy and that as a result the US Navy will not enforce global trade for many other countries. As a result countries like Iran, Japan, India, China etc will become more assertive with their naval forces to further their own goals.

He views the current Chinese economy as a mercantilist bubble that resembles pre-bubble era Japan. He thinks that the war in Ukraine will lead to a decrease of overall world oil supply. He also asserts that the Saudi-Iranian war will finally happen to hot and that because of this Persian Gulf crude will go offline. From this he deduces that East Asian powers will have to increasingly compete with one another for oil and energy, which leads into his next major prediction which is that due to this high level of open competition for oil, China (which is geographically last in line and doesn’t have a blue water navy) won’t be able to outcompete Japan and India and will have their oil essentially cut off while the US economy fully decouples from China at the same time. 

He thinks that war will break out in East Asia, with Japan and China openly competing with one another. 

In my opinion it’s an interesting narrative.

He thinks a famine will kill close to a billion people in places like India and China over the coming few years due to a lack of wheat resulting from the war in Ukraine. He doesn’t mention that countries like India and China don’t eat wheat. They eat rice. India alone exports 1.8 million metric tons of it and most of that is grown completely free of fertilizer or pesticide because India has some of the best agricultural land on the planet. 

It’s important to note that Zeihan isn’t the only one to come out and say that new Chinese data points to a halving of their population by 2050, which is one of the assertions he makes that sounds most radical the first time you hear it. Michael Beckley has said the same thing. I also think it’s important to mention that basically every country that ever held the world reserve currency also concurrently maintained the world’s top naval fleet at the same time. Trade and naval power are intimately connected.

He is basically predicting that increasing US domestic discord will lead to a lack of any real focus in international policy and that as a result the US Navy will not enforce global trade for many other countries. As a result countries like Iran, Japan, India, China etc will become more assertive with their naval forces to further their own goals.

He views the current Chinese economy as a mercantilist bubble that resembles pre-bubble era Japan. He thinks that the war in Ukraine will lead to a decrease of overall world oil supply. He also asserts that the Saudi-Iranian war will finally happen to hot and that because of this Persian Gulf crude will go offline. From this he deduces that East Asian powers will have to increasingly compete with one another for oil and energy, which leads into his next major prediction which is that due to this high level of open competition for oil, China (which is geographically last in line and doesn’t have a blue water navy) won’t be able to outcompete Japan and India and will have their oil essentially cut off while the US economy fully decouples from China at the same time. 

He thinks that war will break out in East Asia, with Japan and China openly competing with one another. 

In my opinion it’s an interesting narrative. I think he neglects to fully investigate just how severely a Chinese war with Taiwan would cripple the West due to TSMC being the only economical source of 5nm and 3nm chips on the planet and how dependent we are on them. I also don’t think he fully addresses Chinese shale developments.

While Earth-imaging technology has always been considered of vital importance to the U.S. military, the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted the need for detailed, accurate images from the private sector that can not only aid the intelligence community in decision-making, but can also help the public understand what is happening on the ground.

Additionally, tracking the buildup of weapons systems by hostile regimes has only ramped up in recent years as countries such as Iran and North Korea have sought to expand their nuclear capabilities.

The increasing focus of the private sector on Environmental, Social, and Corporate (ESG) governance has also expedited the need for detailed images that show mankind's impact on nature. Many of these initiatives are spurred on by agricultural companies that seek to understand the changes in their land over time, as well as investment banks that have backed farms and other food-producing ventures.

Whether it's in the public or private sector, Earth-imaging has applications to dozens of different industries, and the three companies featured in the NRO's contract are some of the most promising players in this burgeoning field.”
