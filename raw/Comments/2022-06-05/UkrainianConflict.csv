66,[],False,,WillBryantSC,,,[],,,,text,t2_8vap6it9,False,False,"Katchanovski’s political agenda prompts him to try and “prove” that the snipers in the Euromaidan were primarily from the Euromaidan protesters and “far right.” One of the first questions that springs to mind is, why has only Katchanovski been able to find purported supporting evidence if it truly is “publicly available, but unreported, suppressed, or misrepresented.” As Marples too has pointed out, the photos used in Katchanovski’s paper are from videos and, therefore, are very blurry. This makes it practically impossible to see snipers, never mind ascertain who they were. There certainly could have been some protesters with guns, although in all of the videos and photos that I have collected, there are only a handful of armed people and these are standing among protesters on the streets – not “shooters” firing from roofs and hotel windows.

Alternative Hypotheses Ignored:
There are various additional explanatory hypotheses for the shootings that Katchanovski never even considers, such as the chaos that results during pitched battles or the collateral damage that results from the actions of different police, Security Service (SBU) units and vigilantes (some of whom had ties to organized crime) involving weapons. Also, the possibility of Russian actors is for some reason never even entertained by Katchanovski. Ukayinska Pravda journalist Serhiy Leshchenko in his new book titled “Mezhyhirya Syndrome” about Yanukovych’s presidency investigates the influence and involvement of President Vladimir Putin and Russian intelligence operatives in Ukraine. Even Putin has admitted that his forces assisted in Yanukovych’s fleeing from Ukraine.

A Western journalist in Kyiv that I interviewed (who desired to remain anonymous) heard from a number of sources that some of the snipers were from Russia. “One source from the presidential administration told me several times in December through February that Yanukovych had brought in mercenaries from Russia and had them based somewhere in central Kyiv, adding that it was not sure what the arrangement was and whether Putin had a direct role in providing them, but it was clear they were ready to shoot at the protestors if needed.” The role of “The Family” was also a factor in the snipers’ activities and later in the violence in the Donbas: “After the sniper shootings took place, this source said he heard from good sources that Yanukovych’s elder son gave the de facto orders to shoot. A second oligarch source said Yanukovych’s eldest son ‘Sasha’ gave the orders to shoot as he was sitting in the situation room.” On leaked intercepts of police radio traffic the words “Sasha, Sasha” are audible. The Western journalist investigating law enforcement officers asked who the snipers in black were, and the Interior Ministry and SBU claimed they were not their men and that they didn’t know who they were.’

A genuinely “academic” paper would have tried to objectively analyze and present these different scenarios and then in his conclusions provide and explain what the author took to be the most likely scenario. Katchanovski instead seems to proceed in the opposite direction insofar as his paper on the massacre caused by snipers appears to have reached a foregone conclusion that is politically driven.

Poor Academic Knowledge and Conspiracy Theories
Still other elements of his paper also do not stand up to scrutiny as reflected in the following three examples. First, Katchanovski criticizes the prosecutor-general’s office for not investigating the murders in a thorough manner. But as is well known, this office is over-manned, incompetent and corrupt, and it has never been able to investigate high-level crimes such as the murder of journalist Georgi Gongadze in 2000 or presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko’s poisoning in 2004. Why should the Euromaidan murders be any different? Second, Katchanovski makes a rather unusual claim for anybody studying Ukraine that there is no written order by Yanukovych ordering the killings. But, as is also well known, such tactics were the norm in the USSR and continue in Ukraine with “telefone pravo” (telephone law, or orders given over the telephone). Orders, and especially controversial orders, are not written down in societies without the rule of law. It is, therefore, not surprising that there is no written order as to who sent police special forces to repress the Orange Revolution on 28 November 2004; there is no documentary evidence to prove who gave the orders to conduct massive election fraud in that year’s election; and there are no documents to show who gave the order to poison former president Yushchenko.

Third, a conspiracy mindset was very deeply ingrained in the former USSR and in post-Soviet Russia and Ukraine where cover-ups, poor investigations and concealed evidence are pointed to as evidence of the existence of conspiracies. Katchanovski’s paper on the snipers massacre follows in this pattern. The conspiracy mindset is heavily prevalent in eastern Ukrainian and in Russian political culture such that Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, the Communist Party and Russian politicians believe that the Georgian Rose and Ukrainian Orange Revolutions as well as the Euromaidan were the supposed product of Western backed putschs.

That Katchanovski’s paper on the snipers massacre is politically driven may be seen in his conclusion when he provides whatMarples believes is an argument “that appears to fall closely into line with the RT version of events disseminated in the Russian Federation.” Katchanovski claims the murders of protesters “represented a violent overthrow of the government in Ukraine and a major human rights crime” committed by “elements” of the Euromaidan and “far-right.” His position ignores the crucial detail that the far right did not come to power after the Euromaidan came to power, and that they lost two pre-term elections in May and October 2014. More importantly, Yanukovych had been preparing to flee throughout the third week of February as can be seen in the security camera videos at his Mezhyhirya palace that he left behind. His flight from Kyiv was, therefore, not in response to a threat expressed by Euromaidan activist Volodymyr Parasiuk from the Maydan stage—who, incidentally, was not a member of Pravyy Sektor. Katchanovski (like Russian statements and propaganda) ignores three other important factors: (1) Yanukovych was impeached by a vote of 328 to zero by parliament: (2) the Party of Regions condemned Yanukovych; and (3) Yatseniuk was appointed prime minister by a vote of 374 to 1.

As these facts demonstrate beyond any doubt, nobody “seized” power, and the Euromaidan was not an illegal “putsch.” If a Ukrainian president dies or is incapacitated, there is provision in the constitution for the parliamentary chairman to become “acting president” until new elections are held. There is, however, no constitutional provision for what action should be taken if the president abandons his job",d7fd4c44b5ff3c403d8b5425b121204faba50a83,True,False,,,,,0,1654472730,,0,{},ibb47x9,False,t3_v5fvu3,False,True,t1_ibb01ig,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5fvu3/why_ukraine_war_is_not_the_wests_fault_realism/ibb47x9/,1654472741,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654443930.0,

A nuke isn’t going to be used. In the event one is used then it will look different than the image in your head of total destruction.

I also believe that if Russia wanted to launch a nuke they would be unable to do so. The US has invested trillions of dollars on its military over many years, decades. Russia isn’t a new threat. The US has the intelligence and capability to stop all attempts. They know where these weapons are and when they’re moved. They also have people on their payroll that are involved in the nuclear launch process.

I know Joe Biden said we wouldn’t go to war with Russia because they have nukes. I think what he really means is that we expect China to make a move and don’t want to be distracted by Europe when every country in Europe has capable militaries. Thus the US does what the Brits, French, etc. tell them to do. This is great teamwork.

I think the west has done a terrible job at deterrence. The single biggest mistake in my opinion was the early statement by Joe Biden that there would be no US boots on the ground. Obviously, no one wants boots on the ground. However, it’s a terribly destructive comment that gives away strategic ambiguity. Russia now has a little more comfort knowing the US will stay out. The US would be better suited to threaten Russia with involvement.

I believe the Leopard 2A4 is from around 1990 so far from state of the art. Would say it would have to be at least a Leopard 2A6 earn that designation, some very improvement upgrades came in the A5 and A6 versions.

However what is probably much much more important than the performance of these on the battlefield is the HUGE significance this would mean to the Ukrainian army, of switching to NATO tanks instead of soviet designs, just as they did with howitzers/MLRS.

The difficulty of integrating NATO tanks in the army will be monumental for their logistics/mechanics etc BUT once this bridge has been crossed it will be much easier and so much more conceivable to get access to more modern NATO tanks after this.

We saw it started with M777 then Ceasars, Panzerhaubitse2000 etc etc and now they've gotten HIMARS/M270's.  Step by step by step.

Thats the whole point of why they say this stuff. It's all vague or from lower level politicians just to cause apprehension and scaredness to support Ukraine in the west, while reinforcing the ""we are victims"" status inside Russia. They use their lower level politicians to spread FUD in the west in a way where their actual leadership will never have to take responsibility for it. 


&gt;““There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic – the balance must be restored,” said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012.” here

They already have nuclear weapons in the baltic sea and in Kaliningrad. (Not that the location of nuclear weapons matters with ICBMs existing)

&gt;One quote from Putin: “Speaking at a meeting in Moscow earlier Monday with several Kremlin-aligned leaders, Putin said Sweden and Finland joining NATO would “certainly provoke our response”” here

I am NOT ruling out potential aggression in the future if another warmongerer takes his position, but these ""provoke our response"" statements could just mean them building more military bases. Like they said they would.

&gt;Another from deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov: “Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the admission of Finland and Sweden to NATO would be a ""grave mistake with far-reaching consequences.""” here

Vague shit. ""You destroyed our ""friendly"" relations"" would suffice for this. Even though Finland and Sweden would prefer to remain completely peaceful with them. Or some other stuff about economics, oil, gas etc.

&gt;Putin again on May 14th, two days prior to his statement about it being “no problem.” “Putin stressed that the end of the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake…” (official Kremlin statement) here

By another example, white St. Petersburg Russians are nearly as exempt as white Muscovites from direct exposure to consequence or carnage.   It's not just Ukraine that's being systematically purged and dismantled, this war is another white genocide.

ISW presents a high quality daily assessment of the Russian Military Campaign on a daily basis which has been incredibly predictive since day 1. So much so they already knew there was no way the Russians were going to take or surround Kiev nor that they will take the current salient in the Donbas.

As we saw with the drive on Kiev, details were only revealed after the Russian retreat, showing a much more fierce battle and very different combat evolved there than previously thought.

Currently there is very, very little data coming out of Sverodonetsk to draw conclusions from. All we know for sure is the UAF's statement that 20% of the city had been recaptured yesterday, that there is very heavy fighting and that artillery keeps making up a larger proportion of the fight.

““There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic – the balance must be restored,” said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012.” [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/4/14/russia-warns-of-nuclear-deployment-if-sweden-finland-join-nato)

One quote from Putin:
“Speaking at a meeting in Moscow earlier Monday with several Kremlin-aligned leaders, Putin said Sweden and Finland joining NATO would “certainly provoke our response”” [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2022/05/16/sweden-officially-announces-nato-bid---after-putin-ominously-warns-of-russian-response-if-it-joins-alongside-finland/amp/)

Another from deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov:
“Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the admission of Finland and Sweden to NATO would be a ""grave mistake with far-reaching consequences.""” [here](https://www.rferl.org/amp/finland-sweden-nato-russia-debate/31852819.html)

Putin again on May 14th, two days prior to his statement about it being “no problem.” 
“Putin stressed that the end of the traditional policy of military neutrality would be a mistake…” (official Kremlin statement) [here](https://www.voanews.com/amp/zelenskyy-duration-of-war-with-russia-depends-on-countries-of-the-free-world-/6571211.html)

Even if Putin was not the most direct about what the potential consequences of that “mistake” might be, many of his ministers were more direct about it (as seen above). For him to come out several days later and portray it as “no problem” in a seemingly nonchalant manner represents a reversal of Kremlin foreign policy rhetoric.

All he’d do is use that ploy again, it’s like when the west kept self deterring over sending weapons acting like that means putin will immediately throw nukes. Then he smelled blood and kept threatening nukes again and again.

And again, with off ramps. Everything is a manipulation for putin, you exchange POWs? Well fine I’m going to kidnap your own citizens and trade them for our POWs too.

“Russia is going to lose this war. They are not going to win.

The difference is in the culture; the way the average person think and behave in their country. In Europe we have mix of at least three cultures.  


1. Rule of law (e.g. France, Germany, Scandinavia): ""We have rules, the rules are the same for everyone, and we must follow them"".

3. Dominance (e.g. Russia): ""The strongest should rule over the weaker. Higher-rank individuals dominate lower-rank individuals"".

I have no idea what plans Ukraine has in respect of it's future intent for the city.  My feeling is they already implicitly broadcast their intent via the Ukraine Luhansk Governor comment today that Severodonetsk is not of strategic importance but Lysychans""k on the west side of the SD river is important.  And ""coincidentally"" happens to be much easier to defend.

So I feel the current operation by Ukraine is opportunistic - eradicate as many Russian forces as possible and if and when the loss equation be unfavorable, then stop and either hold or pull back.

As Ukraine is attacking the losses reported do not surprise me.  

We don't actually know the extent of Russian casualties.  Even Russian sources are inferring that they have been quite substantial and they are pouring everything but the kitchen sink into the city to hold it.  Many assess Russia needs the propaganda victory of taking the city far more then Ukraine needs the strategic victory of holding it.  Especially since Russian media had already reported the city in their hands.

Twitter user WarMonitor posted some [fresh detailed conflict maps about an hour ago](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1533522639398092802) based on various Russian and Ukrainian sources he follows.   They seem to be fairly reliable and indications are Ukraine firmly controls about 50% of the city, there is a gray area that is not reliably controlled by either, and Ukraine is now facing the hard Russian front line guarding the 20% that Russia firmly controls.

As this is where Russia has decided to stand and attempt to hold its ground in my mind the question is whether Ukraine will continue to pound against it to use up Russian reserves which would be a costly strategy to them even if they might win or will they more or less cease in order to preserve their own capacity?

To date I have observed that Ukraine likes to preserve capacity as it seems to be looking at the mid term to long view, and knows that as the war progresses it will continue to grind Russia successfully at many points of contact.

So I suspect Ukraine commanders on the ground will be doing some cost benefit analysis right now.",3fd2516b0a1adeacb3a1e305e8785d78734e8edd,True,False,,,,,0,1654462712,,0,{},ibakaf1,False,t3_v5gelt,False,True,t3_v5gelt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5gelt/talked_to_a_foreign_fighter_in_severodonetsk/ibakaf1/,1654462729,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654433912.0,

The 17-19th century Europeans didn't have today's morals, so I don't really judge them for it (except for shitbirds like Leopold, fuck that guy), but 20th century we knew better.






It's good that Europeans realized colonization was wrong, but just up and leaving was a disaster. We should have prepared Africa and  set them on a stable path. Africa should have only been decolonized completely in the 90s, maybe the late 80s for some places. On top of that Africa should be completely unrecognizable from what it is now. It should be a collection of nearly 1000 unions, federations, and Kingdoms loosely collected together by decision of the locals and overseen by the few large nations with any semblance of a national identity (Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana) and the UN.




That way you avoid shit shows like Congo and Rwanda and Liberia and CAR and fucking everywhere else. If the locals want democracy, cool. If they want tribal communism, fine.

&gt; HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, June 5 - Italian oil company Eni SpA and Spain&amp;#039;s Repsol SA could begin shipping Venezuelan oil to Europe as soon as next month to make up for Russian crude, five people familiar with the matter said, resuming oil-for-debt swaps halted two years ago when Washington stepped up sanctions on Venezuela.

&gt; OTHERS EXCLUDEDWashington has not made similar allowances for U.S. oil major Chevron Corp(CVX.N), India&amp;#039;s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd and France&amp;#039;s Maurel &amp; Prom SA(MAUP.PA), which also lobbied the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury Department to take oil in return for billions of dollars in accumulated debts from Venezuela.

&gt; All five oil companies halted swapping oil for debt in mid-2020 in the midst of former U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Maximum pressure&amp;quot; campaign that cut Venezuela&amp;#039;s oil exports but failed to oust Maduro.

1587,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"The russians took the strategic rail-hub city of Melitopol on the third day of the war, their route apparently greased by Ukrainian turncoats. Controlling the city, a crucial segment of Vladimir Putin’s land bridge to Crimea, has proven somewhat trickier. Every few days brings a surprising report: an armoured train destroyed and a grenade attack on a command post (May 18th); railway tracks and a radar station blown up (May 22nd); a pro-Ukrainian rally (May 29th); and a collaborator’s house hit by an explosion (May 30th). Ukraine claims its partisans have killed more than 100 Russian soldiers behind enemy lines in Melitopol. “Our people are doing everything to make sure the land burns under the feet of the occupiers,” says the town’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, now safe in Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Melitopol is the unofficial capital of Ukraine’s resistance. Since mid-March the war maps produced by the American-based Institute for the Study of War show it covered in stripes, meaning it is territory where partisans are active. But it is far from the only place that has seen such operations. In neighbouring Kherson, a Russian-controlled airbase has been blown up nearly two dozen times. In Enerhodar, Andrii Shevchyk, the collaborationist mayor, was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt. In Izyum, hungry Russian soldiers were purportedly given spiked pies by a seemingly friendly old lady, according to a telephone conversation between a Russian soldier and his girlfriend that was intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence; eight of them reportedly ended up dead. When Russians abandon tanks or petrol trucks, Ukrainian farmers tow them away. Reports of explosions at arms dumps trickle in from the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Fires and explosions at military facilities inside Russia itself are, apparently, becoming more common. In many cases, the evidence points to poor fire safety. But Ukrainian special forces do appear to be targeting supply chains in Russia’s border provinces. On at least one occasion a helicopter struck an oil-storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. Officials in Kyiv refuse to comment on the operations. Speaking off the record, a tight-lipped senior intelligence officer says it would be better to speak to a priest: “This is God’s work. God is punishing the Russian Federation. Maybe not directly. Maybe not with his own hands. Maybe he has to use helicopters.”

Ukraine’s underground resistance in occupied territories is co-ordinated by a unit of its armed forces called the Special Operations Forces (sso). The division was formed in 2015 after attempts at partisan activity failed disastrously in the early stages of the war in the Donbas. A former operative in the unit, who asked to remain anonymous, says the work is split into three parts: military action, support operations and psychological warfare. “Say the task is to stop the enemy from moving more reserves to Melitopol,” he explains. “The sso assigns special forces the task of blowing up a bridge, it asks partisans to damage the railway, and it gets psy-ops [psychological operations] to print leaflets to say we’re on the watch. So in the end, only half the troops dare to come.”

The source says his colleagues spent considerable time preparing potential partisans—“simple local people, but with a secret”—in the years leading up to the war. He refuses to go into detail about the training, but says the basics could be found in “Total Resistance”, a classic guerrilla instruction manual written in 1957 to prepare the Swiss for potential occupation by Warsaw Pact countries. A website published by the sso offers life hacks for Ukraine’s underground warriors. This includes advice about how to organise clandestine resistance (stick to a need-to-know basis), prepare an ambush (ensure clear escape routes), and cope with being arrested (keep calm and hope for the best).

Vladimir Zhemchugov ran dozens of partisan operations for Ukraine in his native Luhansk in 2014-15, before he was maimed by a mine and captured. He says the current resistance mixes professional soldiers and volunteers “60-40, in that order”. Mr Zhemchugov, who now helps train volunteers, says Ukrainian authorities had laid down the basic structure for an insurgency in a few rushed months before the war. A network of secret arms dumps, safe houses and potential sympathisers now exists across the country; in some cases, criminal networks were co-opted. But the preparation was less thorough than it could have been. It was apparently undermined by officials who later switched to support Russia. “The security services and police proved to be our weakest link.”

As in 2014, when war erupted in eastern Ukraine, Russia’s security services appear to have got their hands on secret military databases. In Kherson, Russian officers are visiting the homes of Ukrainians who served in the army. Those who haven’t managed to switch addresses are detained, beaten, tortured or worse. “This work isn’t always good for one’s health,” says the sso source. “The risks are real and it isn’t a walk in the park.” Russia also appears to be stepping up efforts to stamp out Ukrainian resistance, increasing arrests and demonstrative punishments. But intercepts released by Ukrainian security services suggest some Russian soldiers are fearful. “Every fucking night we’re fighting with diversionary groups who come into the village,” one soldier tells his friend in a call. “Some of us have had enough. We’re getting the fuck out of here.”

Mr Fedorov, Melitopol’s mayor, was abducted by occupying forces before being released on March 16th in a prisoner exchange. He said Ukraine’s resistance would continue to attract new recruits despite the risks. Only one in ten of Melitopol’s residents had switched to the other side, and that wasn’t a critical mass, he suggested. But the true strength of Ukraine’s resistance will be tested only in a new phase of the war: provided enough Western weapons arrive, Kyiv hopes to launch a counter-attack to retake the south. The tight-lipped intelligence officer predicts Ukraine’s underground army will prove to be a big asset. He suggests Vladimir Putin’s troops will be forced to beat an ugly retreat. “The Russians will be able to write another ‘War and Peace’. I’ve always been very fond of Tolstoy.” ■",a59b64ebafd9d73977278437b84f7336366fd9b5,True,False,,,,,0,1654454837,,0,{},iba3xom,True,t3_v5jlsr,False,True,t3_v5jlsr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5jlsr/ukraines_partisans_are_hitting_russian_soldiers/iba3xom/,1654454853,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654426037.0,

*In Russian-occupied cities like Melitopol, covert resistance continues*

The russians took the strategic rail-hub city of Melitopol on the third day of the war, their route apparently greased by Ukrainian turncoats. Controlling the city, a crucial segment of Vladimir Putin’s land bridge to Crimea, has proven somewhat trickier. Every few days brings a surprising report: an armoured train destroyed and a grenade attack on a command post (May 18th); railway tracks and a radar station blown up (May 22nd); a pro-Ukrainian rally (May 29th); and a collaborator’s house hit by an explosion (May 30th). Ukraine claims its partisans have killed more than 100 Russian soldiers behind enemy lines in Melitopol. “Our people are doing everything to make sure the land burns under the feet of the occupiers,” says the town’s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, now safe in Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Melitopol is the unofficial capital of Ukraine’s resistance. Since mid-March the war maps produced by the American-based Institute for the Study of War show it covered in stripes, meaning it is territory where partisans are active. But it is far from the only place that has seen such operations. In neighbouring Kherson, a Russian-controlled airbase has been blown up nearly two dozen times. In Enerhodar, Andrii Shevchyk, the collaborationist mayor, was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt. In Izyum, hungry Russian soldiers were purportedly given spiked pies by a seemingly friendly old lady, according to a telephone conversation between a Russian soldier and his girlfriend that was intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence; eight of them reportedly ended up dead. When Russians abandon tanks or petrol trucks, Ukrainian farmers tow them away. Reports of explosions at arms dumps trickle in from the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. 

Fires and explosions at military installations inside Russia itself are apparently becoming more common. In many cases, the evidence points to poor fire safety. But Ukrainian special forces appear to be targeting supply chains in provinces bordering Russia. On at least one occasion, a helicopter hit an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk. Kyiv officials decline to comment on the operations. Speaking off the record, a pursed-lipped senior intelligence officer said it would be best to talk to a priest: “It’s God’s work. God punishes the Russian Federation. Maybe not directly. Maybe not with his own hands. Maybe he has to use helicopters.

Ukraine’s underground resistance in the occupied territories is coordinated by a unit of its armed forces called Special Operations Forces (sso). The division was formed in 2015 after the disastrous failure of attempts at partisan activity at the start of the war in Donbass. A former agent of the unit, who asked to remain anonymous, explains that the work is divided into three parts: military action, support operations and psychological warfare. “Let’s say the task is to prevent the enemy from moving more reserves to Melitopol,” he explains. “The sso assigns special forces to blow up a bridge, he asks partisans to damage the railroad, and he gets psy-ops [psychological operations] print leaflets to say that we are on the lookout. So in the end, only half of the troops dare to come.

The source says his colleagues spent a considerable amount of time grooming potential supporters – “just locals, but with a secret” – in the years leading up to the war. He declines to go into details of the training, but says the basics could be found in “Total Resistance”, a classic guerrilla warfare instruction manual written in 1957 to prepare the Swiss for possible occupation by the countries of the Warsaw Pact. A website edited by the sso offers life hacks for Ukrainian underground warriors. This includes advice on how to organize underground resistance (stick to the need to know), prepare an ambush (ensure clear escape routes) and deal with arrest (keep calm and hope for the best).

Vladimir Zhemchugov carried out dozens of partisan operations for Ukraine in his hometown of Lugansk in 2014-2015, before being maimed by a landmine and captured. He says the current resistance mixes professional soldiers and volunteers “60-40, in that order”. Mr Zhemchugov, who is now helping to train volunteers, said Ukrainian authorities established the basic structure of an insurgency in a rushed few months before the war. A network of secret arms depots, safe houses and potential sympathizers now exists across the country; in some cases, criminal networks have been co-opted. But the preparation was less thorough than it could have been. He was apparently undermined by officials who then turned to supporting Russia. “The security services and the police have proven to be our weakest link.”

As in 2014, when war broke out in eastern Ukraine, Russian security services appear to have got their hands on secret military databases. In Kherson, Russian officers visit the homes of Ukrainians who served in the army. Those who failed to change address are detained, beaten, tortured or worse. “This work is not always good for your health”, says the sso The source. “The risks are real and this is no walk in the park.” Russia also appears to be stepping up its efforts to stamp out Ukrainian resistance, increasing arrests and demonstrative punishments. But intercepts released by Ukrainian security services suggest that some Russian soldiers are scared. “Every goddamn night we fight against diversion groups that enter the village,” a soldier told his friend during a call. “Some of us have had enough. We’re getting the hell out of here.

Mr. Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol, was abducted by the occupying forces before being released on March 16 in a prisoner exchange. He said the Ukrainian resistance would continue to attract new recruits despite the risks. Only one in ten Melitopol residents had crossed over, and that was not a critical mass, he suggested. But the true strength of Ukrainian resistance will only be tested in a new phase of the war: provided enough Western weapons arrive, Kyiv hopes to launch a counterattack to retake the south.

Macron's statements do nothing to create or maintain an option for negotiations to open considering negotiations are open without them.

The most generous interpretation is - they are pointless and ignore the entire context of what's going on. They'd have a point if Ukraine was insisting on not coming to the table but the only country doing that right now is Russia. Talking about how the west needs to make it even easier for Russia to do the thing it is refusing to do (negotiate) doesn't help the goal you say it has (bringing Russia to the table).

You started by talking about how it's Macron's statements are important to not give Russia fodder for its propaganda. Three comments later you drifted over to 'if NATO was waging war on Russia and refusing to negotiate China would be reacting differently.' That's got nothing to do with where the conversation started - did Macron's statements about not humiliating Russia have a positive effect? Unless, of course, you're thinking that, without Macron's statement, China would believe NATO is at war with Russia and refusing to negotiate. 

But the fact that I'm keeping the conversation on the topic it started is, for you, proof that I have no desire for good faith conversation, huh?

The first rockets and the first Russian soldiers arrived in Ukraine, and the world was stunned. Since then, Russia has succeeded in conquering 20% of the Ukrainian territory, according to the figures put forward by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.

The primary objective of the Russian “special military operation” was the complete conquest of Ukraine, to “denazify” the country and its state structure. This goal has not yet been achieved: the offensive around Kyiv has been stopped, and the second and third largest cities, Kharkiv and Odesa, also remain in Ukrainian hands.

However, in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts (provinces), the situation is less rosy. Mariupol has been conquered, so Russia now has complete control over the area between the pro-Russian satellite states of Ukraine and the annexed Crimean peninsula. Meanwhile, the battle for Sievierodonetsk, the last major city in Luhansk, which at the time of writing is still partly in Ukrainian hands, is raging.

This extremely cruel war teaches us at least 4 major lessons about the future of modern warfare:

But for well over a century there have been international standards in how war is conducted to ensure that military campaigns are waged in a manner which is focused on attacking legitimate military targets as best they can. Civilian casualties and damage can never be avoided entirely, so international law makes provisions allowing a degree of collateral damage based on limitations in military capabilities, and talks about things like '[military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_necessity)', '[proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(law%29)', and '[distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_(law%)'.

The Allies were defending themselves against the wars of aggression launched by genocidal fascists, and ending the war *would also end their campaigns of genocide*, which were killing many thousands of innocent people per day. The targeting of specific cities because that was the extent of the military's ability to target those cities' contributions to the war was a limitation of the technology of the time under combat conditions. Had the city been undefended, attacking it would have been very different and civilian casualties would have been largely avoidable, but the people attempting to attack the military targets *were also being shot at*.

There are cases where specific actions by allied nations can be criticized - for example, the British legitimately did retaliate against the Nazi bombing of civilians by deliberately targeting civilian housing, and that's not okay. But the allied command started out with the idea of surgical bombing strikes and it turned out that *literally didn't work* with the technology of the time - the shift to massed strategic bombings occurred in response to the ineffectiveness of aerial bombing at achieving strategic objectives, it wasn't just done for the hell of it or without consideration for how it was to actually help win the war.

&gt; That is based on the accounts of the Allied generals, and, still, there are few living people who confirm that. Please do your research.

I *have* done my research: you clearly have *not*. If you actually read the documents available from during the war, the allied bomber commands were were working with the goal of ending the war and with the laws of war in mind - unlike the Nazis they were fighting who engaged in deliberate terror bombings of civilians from the start - and while we have some specific examples where they did things wrong, so long as the Nazi regime defended those cities their destruction was an inevitability of the war the Nazis started.

&gt; You sound like a russian appologist who tells on russian tv that bombing Ukrainian cities is justified.

No you lying fuck, I sound like someone supporting the Ukrainians' right to self-defense even if collateral damage results, so long as the collateral damage inflicted by the Ukrainians is proportional, of military necessity, and distinguishes between military and civilian targets to within the best of their ability.

I sound like someone saying that any such damage affecting civilians is the fault of the Russians for invading in the first place. And like someone saying the Russians are to blame for any harm to Ukrainian civilians for launching a war of aggression in the first place.

You sound like someone saying the Ukrainians can't morally defend themselves against invasion and should surrender to the Russians.

Preserving the man's dignity prolongs a horrible war, and leaves him with the scraps of a good bargaining position to play with. The better course of action would be to utterly humiliate him. Laugh at him publicly. Call him names. Openly mock Putin and his military. 

When Putin is treated with open contempt, he will come to the table quite quickly. As long as he can preserve a shred of dignity, he will continue to see what he can get away with. Moreover, we should now be seeking to break Russia up into several more nations, and remove some of its territory. Putin should be wondering if he won't lose Königsburg, his ports on the Azov sea, and several of the islands North of Japan for pulling this stunt. It shouldn't be a question of letting him go back to his pre-war borders. 

It's easier to give things up in negotiation. We should be re-defining just how bad Russia has fucked itself here.

A week ago former German NATO general Ramms said in an interview that, in his opinion, the appearance of this tanks just means that Russia tracked more units from their military district south. They are usually equipped with older equipment like the T-62.

More modern equipped units from the military district west are likely held back to counter the NATO troop reinforcements on it's eastern flank.

&gt;it is better than no tanks at all.

Regarding the T-62 Ramms said that it should not be underestimated. It is indeed more vulnerable against short-range anti-tank weapons due to its weaker armor, but has a powerful gun and can engage targets at longer ranges.

Your post is full of assumptions anyway. I never claimed the Russian army was extremely skilled or even equipped for modern war. They are not. I said that they are pulling their modernized T-62s and T-64s out of storage and almost definitely using those to outfit new BTGs. For any modern army, a modernized T-62 would be a waste of time. But Russia does not have T-72B3s or anything else more modern to outfit 70 new BTGs at the scale required. Each BTG has at least 10 tanks. That's 700 tanks at minimum to outfit the newly constructed units and you can easily double that, since they will need just as many to replace losses or just because of various malfunctions and failures. So 1400 tanks.

They have that in storage in terms of upgraded T-62s, ready, right NOW. They do not have other tanks good enough for the battlefield ready yet at the kind of scale required.

I am being pretty precise here with what I'm saying.

&gt;performing anywhere near as well as you claim.

&amp;#x200B;

Where did I claim stellar performance, ANYWHERE in what I posted? I said their logistics seem to have been mostly ironed out. I didn't say they were equipped for modern war or even really that great. They didn't even iron out issues with radios, which is crucial for the function of the BTGs, before they started. The BTG being a smaller formation which is more flexible and hard hitting but also more fragile, it needs excellent communications, which were severely neglected. 

One of the reasons you even see so much artillery and use of tanks is that when you're a leader in a BTG, that's one of the first tools in your arsenal. One of it's primary weaknesses is the extremely low number of men and the primary criticism of it, which means, less troops for security and unwillingness to engage in urban combat, because you simply don't have the sheer manpower to pull it off. Again, why you NEED good communications and solid cooperation with other elements, which they HAVE NOT achieved, even to this day. 

Drones SHOULD NOT be flying. Every drone the Ukrainians use is within the theoretical ability of Russia AA to disable. But they are not disabled.

I just watched the latest Perun video (https://youtu.be/sSPhOWDkcPk ) so I have Poland on my mind. They’ve already been in the process of modernizing their military and the ring trade has just sped that up as they give Ukraine all their old kit, and that means that the Poles are also going to have increasing needs for establishing training and maintenance programs on NATO hardware. 

Above and beyond the current need to get Ukrainians trained on western equipment for supply reasons, assuming Ukraine kicks out the Russians they’ll also likely end up stocked to the gills with NATO hardware. 

Seems like the right opportunity to go all in on developing those capabilities in full in Poland as quickly as possible and include as many Ukrainian units as they can provide instead of piecemeal efforts sending a handful of Ukrainian units here or there as equipment opportunities pop up. 

You’d have robust, permanent, training and maintenance programs protected in Poland, the ability to max upgrade Polands forces, the chance to train Ukrainian troops in NATO combined arms, and a nearby parts and repair pipeline - two birds with one stone.",8831d571ebe427e389c898d89962f3979060e6c5,True,False,,,,,0,1654446589,,0,{},ib9me29,False,t3_v5fduc,False,True,t1_ib9l05m,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5fduc/german_head_of_armed_forces_ukrainians_are_done/ib9me29/,1654446607,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654417789.0,

I see the difference between the two statements at the end of your comment. I have been arguing that now is not the time for the second statement, not that it cancels out the first. I'm not sure why you're misrepresenting or misunderstanding that.

To take your comment in order: 
All those videos add up to... less than 30,000 people. If you believe civil opposition in Russia has a meaningful ability to affect politics or society your understanding of modern Russia is way off and I'm not sure Reddit's comment limits allow for the in-depth discussion necessary on that. 

If you really think domestically-oppressed Russians are acting as they are not in response to the situation for them in Russia but because of the words of some distant western leaders, you're engaging in chauvinism and have a basic misunderstanding of Russian society. I tell you this as someone with firsthand knowledge of the latter. Point me to a significant opposition figure in Russia who is saying that this war will stop from domestic opposition or the West needs to be holding out its hand more if you think that my assessment is wrong, don't just theorize based on how public opinion works in (I presume your) western society.

To your next 'point' - I understand two things can be done at once. What I'm saying is that context matters and when you do something matters. When Macron is talking about after the war before the conditions of the end of the war have been figured out, he is putting the cart before the horse. When Russia is saying 'we're going to keep killing Ukrainians' and Macron's response is 'don't be too harsh on it once you manage to get it to stop killing Ukrainians' it's a response that is not appropriate to the context. It would be the same thing as Britain saying in 1940 that the Poles shouldn't humiliate Germany with their demands. 

It seems you're arguing that, without any context, in the abstract, it's better to not humiliate defeated nations. Ok. No one's arguing against that. The argument is 'while a country thinks its aggression is right and is continuing that aggression, don't talk about how we should worry about not upsetting or humiliating that country until the aggression has stopped.' What about that seems bad to you? What is the danger? Or are you thinking that this ends with Russian civil society rising up against Putin and we need to encourage that? If so, I can tell you right now that won't happen.


You seem to think I'm arguing 'Russia should be humiliated'. What I'm arguing is 'being the first to talk at length about peace conditions before the war is won is counterproductive, particularly when one side of that war believes it can outlast your allies'. So far the only argument you've made for why it is important to talk about not humiliating Russia *now*, while it's still attacking, is that it helps Russian opposition in some meaningful way. That is wrong based on my knowledge of the society but I'm guessing we won't agree on that point. So you have any other reasons, beside the imagined domestic effect in Russia, to be talking about this now?

 You're saying Macron is talking about peace conditions without responding to any concrete proposal from the Ukrainian side and not worried about any concrete thing. Why do that? It emboldens Russia by giving it hope the west will tire (as Putin has stated he believes) - so there's how it harms Ukrainians directly. The war continues and Putin doesn't come to the table nor are there signs of the regime losing control - so there's how it doesn't help Ukraine or the world end this war. If you believe Macron's statements are enough to make a difference in Russia, why might they not make a *negative* difference by confirming Putin's hope that the west will lack the will to support Ukraine through a long war?

Macron's talking about peace conditions before the war is close to won. The most generous interpretation is that what he is saying is pointless since, as you say, it is not responding to any concrete proposal or plan and is not happening at a time when those are being developed. 

Finally, I think you and I have a basic disagreement about the importance of morale and leadership in war generally, and a potentially-existential war in fact. To me it seems obviously ludicrous for the Allies in 1942 to have publicly begun to talk about the fair peace terms and reasonable German people. It would have sapped morale and made Germany believe even more strongly that a negotiated peace was available to it should it want (though at that time, the main problem would've been that allied civilian and fighting forces would either be less willing to sacrifice to defeat the enemy or would democratically depose the government thinking about the terms of rapprochement while their children were being bombed).",a70a4bc926eb0d2a1154391a6a566ce363a257a4,True,False,,,,,0,1654445515,,0,{},ib9k4jd,False,t3_v4pq46,False,True,t1_ib8osy7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4pq46/kotkin_stalin_biographer_in_a_foreign_affairs/ib9k4jd/,1654445532,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654416715.0,

They can fit basically any fighter role from air superiority to bombing and SEAD.

Nothing on a T72 B3, but they have upgraded T62s and T64s which are ready NOW. 

Those are thousands of tanks they can use to outfit 70+ new BTGs. In case anyone forgot, the Russian BTG is that slightly smaller battalion the Russians use which has integrated combined arms and a slightly smaller number of troops, which Russia has adopted for quite a while now. One of the advantages of having a lot of hardware in storage or just in general is that you can have battalions which punch way above their weight class, potentially. Hence, the Russian BTG. 

Ukraine does not have an equivalent in the ability to outfit a vast number of battalions with the equipment they require. You can go through the list of equipment they received at your leisure and quickly figure out this isn't equipment at the scale necessary for raising new armies back home.

As far as improvements to defence procurement, logistics and the supply chain, we've been hearing how Russia ran out of trucks 1500 times already. Yes, they had issues and still have some issues, but I don't think counting on logistics and supply chains not to be ironed out in as harsh an environment as a war is a little optimistic. 

Small unit tactics are all well and good, but you actually have to inflict decisive defeats on the enemy, which Ukraine has yet to achieve. If this is just a battle of attrition, it's anyone's game.

Russian morale is a tossup. It could get worse, it could get better. It depends on a lot of things. Ukrainian morale could also drop if they have a significant setback in the Donbass as well.

Putin’s dependence on petrodollars means that, by [announcing](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61638860) an embargo on about 90% of Russian oil imports within the next 6-8 months, the European Union is hitting Russia where it hurts. Putin is now all but certain to face a major fiscal crisis within a year, making it difficult to sustain his war in Ukraine, let alone invade another country.

The problem is that the embargo will help Putin in the short term. The mere announcement of it has already caused [oil prices to spike](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/31/oil-prices-eu-russian-crude.html). That is why Europe should complement its oil embargo with additional, immediate measures. Two options stand out. The first – which [Ricardo Hausmann](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ricardo-hausmann)[proposed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/case-for-punitive-tax-on-russian-oil-by-ricardo-hausmann-2022-02) immediately after the invasion, and which others [have shown](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/27/Garicano-OpEd-Russian-Oil-Tariff-EUCO.pdf) can be [implemented quickly](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/western-buyers-cartel-could-deny-russia-oil-revenue-by-simon-johnson-2022-05) – is a high tariff on Russian oil imports. This approach makes perfect economic sense. Every euro spent on Russian oil helps Putin finance his violent campaign in Ukraine. This is a “blood externality,” and should be priced accordingly. Part of the amount paid by buyers of Russian hydrocarbons should be transferred to Ukraine as reparations or stored in special escrow accounts until reparations are formally awarded. But at a time when European households are facing soaring energy costs, there is little political appetite for an oil tax. With this in mind, Italian Prime Minister [Mario Draghi](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/mario-draghi) has [proposed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-05/italy-to-discuss-price-cap-mechanism-for-energy-from-russia) an alternative solution: a price cap. Under this proposal – which the European Council has [instructed](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-eu-draghi/eu-commission-has-been-given-mandate-to-examine-gas-price-cap-italy-pm-idINR1N2WC01E) the Commission to assess – Western countries would pay a lower price for Russian oil and gas, and impose secondary sanctions on third parties that pay Russia more. A price cap could be implemented immediately – say, at $70 per barrel – and lowered by about $10 each month the war continues. Yes, Putin could refuse to sell oil at this price. But, given that he is already desperate enough to sell to China and India at [steep discounts](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-putin-wants-help-from-india-china-on-oil-europe-doesnt-want/articleshow/91915275.cms), and today’s energy prices far exceed production costs, this seems unlikely. Instead, Russia would probably continue supplying oil and gas to Western buyers at the capped price, while buyers like China and India, under threat of sanctions, would have no reason to pay more. This would provide consumers relief from high energy prices and cause Russia’s revenues to decline sharply. Some might argue that price caps distort incentives – in this case, the incentive to adopt renewables. But this argument applies only to a competitive market. In today’s oil and gas market, prices far exceed marginal costs, and the global oil cartel OPEC+ (which includes Russia) has only recently [agreed](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/02/energy/oil-prices-opec-russia/index.html) to increase production in July and August. Russian gas supplier Gazprom was likely [manipulating prices in Europe](https://www.martenscentre.eu/blog/how-gazprom-manipulated-the-eu-gas-market/) even [before the war](https://www.ft.com/content/e06c3b5d-153d-4c86-8c49-0d5447d58e76). Such monopolistic behavior warrants a price cap.

Another frequent argument against a price cap is that it may spur a black market. This is a real risk. Already, European energy companies have begun [combining](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-04-08/ukraine-war-this-backdoor-keeps-russian-oil-flowing-into-europe) Russian petroleum products with others – a “Latvian blend” – so that they can take advantage of lower prices, while claiming not to support Putin’s war machine. But these firms are not currently violating any laws. If a price cap were implemented, they would be. Given public outrage at the war, the West’s commitment to secondary sanctions, and the [rise of citizen-led investigations](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/05/24/anonymous-tipsters-angry-at-russia-help-detect-sanctions-busters) relying on open-source intelligence, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to get away with such rule-breaking. The EU’s oil embargo will hurt Putin, but not soon enough. Europe must immediately impose a price cap on Russian oil and gas.

# Europe’s Oil Embargo Is Not Enough

Jun 3, 2022 [Sergei Guriev](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/sergei-guriev)

*By announcing an embargo on about 90% of Russian oil imports within the next 6-8 months, the European Union is hitting Russian President Vladimir Putin where it hurts. But, unless Europe also imposes an immediate price cap on Russian energy imports, Putin will spend the next several months benefiting from sharply higher oil prices.*

PARIS – Vladimir Putin needs petrodollars, and he needs them now. Many expected Russia’s president to issue a formal declaration of war on Ukraine, a move that would permit the full mobilization of Russia’s reserve forces. But while Putin may want to send more soldiers to Ukraine, he cannot afford to do so. Will the European Union’s newly announced oil embargo force him to wind down the invasion?

Already, the Kremlin has toned down its propaganda. There is no more talk of taking Kyiv. Putin’s only goal now, apparently, is to occupy the [eastern Donbas region](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60938544). But even there, Putin is not guaranteed victory, as that is where Ukraine has launched its so-called [Joint Forces Operation](https://www.ft.com/content/384d981b-d3da-4fca-b6ab-21b1136bd2ab), which includes its best-trained military units – increasingly armed with advanced Western military equipment. Russia, meanwhile, has lost much of its [modern military equipment](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-war-military-equipment-losses/31847839.html#:~:text=Russia%20has%20reportedly%20lost%20more,morale%2C%20and%20important%20design%20flaws.), and Western sanctions have left it unable to replenish its stocks. With few options, Russia is now [unpacking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/05/25/the-russian-army-is-running-out-of-tanks-for-the-war-in-ukraine-these-60-year-old-t-62s-are-proof/) Soviet-era tanks. The only way Putin can make up for the lack of equipment is to send more soldiers. But drafting new conscripts is an unpopular idea, so Putin has resorted to paying people to fight for Russia – and no pittance, either. Recruits are now reportedly receiving [$3,000-$5,000 per month](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-offers-soldiers-signing-bonuses-ukraine-war-manpower-crunch-2022-5). But, the recent decision to [scrap the age limit](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lawmakers-vote-scrap-upper-age-limit-military-2022-05-25/) for army recruits suggests that even the prospect of earning pay that is an order of magnitude higher than the average wage in the median Russian region is not attracting enough fighters. Recently published [budget data](https://thebell.io/en/rising-oil-dependency/) from Russia’s finance ministry suggests that Putin can hardly afford to cover the war’s mounting costs. The data confirm, first, that the war has been expensive, with military spending having increased by almost 130% last month, to 630 billion rubles ($10.2 billion), or 6% of annual GDP on a prorated basis. The data also show that Russia ran a fiscal deficit of more than 260 billion rubles in April, or 2.5% of GDP when prorated to annual figures. While global oil prices are very high, Russia has been selling its oil at a huge discount – accepting [$70 per barrel](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/050322-lured-by-cheap-oil-india-becomes-largest-customer-of-russian-urals-crude) for Urals crude in recent weeks, 30% below the market price – while overall output is set to [decline by 10%](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/051822-russian-hydrocarbons-output-exports-to-drop-significantly-following-ukraine-invasion) this year. Meanwhile, non-hydrocarbon revenues have plummeted, leaving oil and gas taxes accounting for more than 60% of fiscal revenues, compared to less than 40% a year ago.",9b1afad3b3419eaa86f65805c74727ef88e9d0b3,True,False,,,,,0,1654444338,,0,{},ib9hnic,True,t3_v5g6p4,False,True,t3_v5g6p4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5g6p4/europes_oil_embargo_is_not_enough_by_sergei_guriev/ib9hnic/,1654444355,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654415538.0,

Google translation of the original source:

Unbelievable are the quantities of weapons and ammunition that they gave or are about to cede to the Ukrainian zelensky regime to fight the ""authoritarian Russian regime"", as the Greek ULA N. Panvagiotopoulos described it. They all come from warehouses of the Greek Army on the islands.  
In total, the type and quantities of war material are reportedly as follows:

 122 TOMA BMP-1 with all the ammunition of their machine guns  
15,000 73 mm projectiles.  
2,100 122 mm rockets

20,000 offensive AK-47 Kalashnikov rifles  
  
3,200,000 7.62mm cartridges,  
  
60 MANPAD FIM-92 Stinger,

17,000 155mm artillery projectiles  
  
1,100 RPG-18 anti-tank rockets  
  
According to reports, 6 Greek C-130, 10 Canadian and 5 New Zealand transport aircraft were used to transport all this.

For the transportation of the BMP-1, Greek and allied tanks will be used that will sail to the port of Alexandroupolis. The Ukrainians themselves say that ""they succeeded with the Greek weapons in the extermination of hundreds of Russians"".

A bunch of countries. It was the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances), a non-legally-binding memorandum.

Ukraine didn't have the resources to secure and maintain a nuclear arsenal, and in exchange for giving it up, they got a lot of financial and diplomatic support from the other parties to the memorandum. Which is likely why their economy and government has been doing relatively well for the past decade. Uniting against Russian interference in their government was a great turning point.

If Ukraine still had the nuclear weapons, and had they spent the money to maintain it, it would have drained resources and likely resulted in a worse outcome for the country.

True.  It was a long, slow and arduous process that took centuries, dotted with a variety of historical accidents, coincidences and periods of relapse into older, dumber, more barbaric ways of doing things.  

And it was by no means inevitable.

In that instance, they’re capitalizing on the anti-west sentiment they’ve been amplifying through online trolling for the past two years in Africa. Sadly, people very often care more about being right and having their opinion confirmed rather than actual facts, so that troll campaign have been very successful. That’s how Wagner got invited to replace the French military in Mali, and they started slaughtering and raping people as they always do (these sick fucks raped women in a maternity ward). Wanna know what the military junta in power did when our medias reported it ? They banned the RFI and France 24 channels, and tried to accuse the French military of being the killers. One of our drones fillmed the Wagner guys burying cadavers in the sand near a base we were handing over to the Malians, so the junta accused us of using illegal surveillance stuff on their land. We were there completely legally, the government they toppled asked us for help against islamists fighters in their northern territories a couple years ago. 
Malians seems pretty happy, they see the Wagner guys are liberators from the French oppression and totally denied even needing troll for hating France after we published a study proving their influencers were being paid by Russia (as I said, that troll campaign is very successful); even though we weren’t oppressing them, lately we merely served as a buffer to prevent the military junta from blindly slaughtering nomads in the north, which they did do with the help of Wagner as soon as we left.

Knowing all that, it kinda piss me off when people argue Macron is being too friendly with Russia, we’re not friends with them, they are clearly an enemy to us.

&gt; According to a survey performed by Civey, half of all Germans don&amp;#039;t believe that Scholz is doing everything in his power to rapidly provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs.

&gt; On the day after the war began, a Friday, Dutch Defense Minister Karin Hildur Ollengren called her German counterpart Christine Lambrecht and informed her that the Netherlands intended to deliver 400 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.

&gt; Olaf Scholz has never satisfactorily explained his aversion to sending armored vehicles to Ukraine.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a renewed threat to Western leaders that Moscow would order strikes on new targets should the U.S. supply Ukraine with long-range missiles, according to a state-owned mouthpiece.

&gt; The TASS news agency quoted Putin&amp;#039;s comments from a Sunday, June 5, interview on Rossiya-1, where the Russian leader mentioned the delivery of U.S. rocket systems to Ukraine.

&gt; Putin said if the long-range rockets were delivered that Russia would strike new locations, although he stopped short of mentioning where these targets might be.

Look at Iraq and Afghanistan. They were spoonfed democracy, they rejected it, massively. Good or bad people are really just the choices they make and characters that result from those choices. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, also made a choice, and lo and behold what happened. 

The morality level in the middle east is crippling for example, non rational-tradition based, can't ask questions, don't want to for the most part therefore their institutions CANT go beyond that level.

The rest of the world killed people like Socrates(like the greeks and the jews with Jesus) AND their ideas in their lands, efficiently, by choice btw, and those ""lucky"" ideas never took root-including science, they had plenty of talented people who were disregarded.

Leos arent better than M1s, but the difference between the 2 in fighting capabilities is small and from the information we could gather from the battlefield, the russian tanks are filthy, ill maintained and lack logistics. (fast refulling and repairment etc)

If Ukraine  receives superior anti air and finally some fighter jets, which can outclass the russian airforce, the war should be over soon. The only pressure russia is able to hold up is artillery fire in combination with air strikes. Ukraine lacks anti air capabilities, which could have been delivered much ealier by germany. With marders and gepards and german howitzers, russian airforce would not be able to attack the superior western artillery pieces and russian regiments would get shreded to pieces. Germanys anti artillery and artillery is superior to most russian artillery material.

At this point western allies should dicuss the delivery of all possible sovjet style jets they still have in stock + training for ukraine pilots on f22 raptors and not debating about humilation.

*Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a renewed threat to Western leaders that Moscow would order strikes on new targets should the U.S. supply Ukraine with long-range missiles, according to a state-owned mouthpiece.*  
  
*The TASS news agency quoted Putin's comments from a Sunday, June 5, interview on Rossiya-1, where the Russian leader mentioned the delivery of U.S. rocket systems to Ukraine.*  
  
*Putin said if the long-range rockets were delivered that Russia would strike new locations, although he stopped short of mentioning where these targets might be.*  
  
*He added: ""If it now comes to rockets and they are supplied, we will draw conclusions from that and employ our weapons that we have in sufficient quantities to strike those facilities that we are not attacking so far.""*  
  
*It comes after President Joe Biden announced earlier this week that the U.S. would provide Ukraine with ""more advanced rocket systems and munitions.""*  
  
*The U.S. Department of Defense on Wednesday announced new security assistance for Ukraine worth an estimated $700 million.*  
  
*During the interview, Putin claimed the ""fuss"" of armament deliveries to Kyiv was to stretch out the conflict as long as possible.*  
  
*He added the new armaments were being sent to Ukraine in order to refill its depleted stock.*  
  
*In the interview, Putin said: ""We believe that the delivery of rocket systems by the United States and some other countries is related to making up for the losses of this combat hardware. There is nothing new about that and this actually changes nothing""*  
  
*Putin also claimed Russian air defenses had shot down numerous Ukrainian drones as the conflict moves beyond 100 days.*  
  
*He said in the same interview: ""We do have such systems. Buk, Tor and Pantsyr \[air defense\] systems are highly effective.*  
  
*""Our defense systems are operating in such a way and hope that no one if offended, but they are cracking them \[drones\] like nuts. Tens and tens of such drones have been eliminated.""*  
  
*Newsweek has contacted the office of the President of Ukraine and the Kremlin for comment.*  
  
*While Russia has faced numerous strategic setbacks during the opening phase of the war, including failing to capture Kyiv, its forces have focused their efforts in eastern Ukraine.*  
  
*The region is populated by many Russian-speaking people who have been engaged in armed conflict with Ukrainian forces since they declared the breakaway separatist regions of Luhansk and Donetsk were independent of Kyiv's control in 2014.*  
  
*But pundits on the Kremlin's state-run television channels admitted that some Russian-speaking Ukrainians had been fighting back against Moscow's forces.*  
  
*It blew a hole in the Kremlin's narrative that Russian forces invaded Ukraine to liberate the peoples of the region and also to de-nazify the country.*",d12f1f43106ecc46c3e2d6b2c17e5e465e447d95,True,False,,,,,0,1654438244,,0,{},ib95jj0,True,t3_v5e4re,False,True,t3_v5e4re,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5e4re/putin_issues_fresh_warning_to_west_over_missile/ib95jj0/,1654438258,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654409444.0,

In short:  the default state of the human race prior to the Enlightenment and the scientific/humanist revolution of the 1700s.

That is the problem I have with both the rah-rah western racism(""we are inherently better than ""those people"""") and the sort of post-modernist moral relativism(""western values are just one of many ways to live and you can't say one is any better than another"").  Both miss the point.  

Yes, our way of life and organizing civil society is better.  But not because we are better people.  We were just lucky enough to figure it out ahead of the rest of the world and reaped the massive benefits of that, often to other nations detriment as those benefits also came with massive economic and military power as a byproduct.  That, by the way, is one thing I only really learned later in life - the hard left ""post-colonial"" critique of the west that we only have enjoy the liberal institutions we do because we exported our misery to other parts of the globe via military and economic dominance has it backwards - the only reason why got that dominance in the first place is because we built superior institutions first.  

&gt;And ofc, its all the wests fault, that forbid slavery and the slave trade AGAINST the economic interests of Africa and the Middle East-it was a serious economic activity over there.

To be fair ""ending slavery"" was for the British Empire in the mid to late 19th century what ""spreading democracy"" was for the post-9/11 US government.

Its not about Ukraine.

Russian propaganda has framed this conflict as righteous defense against Western/NATO expansion.

In many countries the wounds of western imperialism are still wide open, the memories fresh, the victims alive or recently dead and still remembered. Millennials were alive during Apartheid for example. Parents and grandparents fought in the wars for independence or were brutalized by colonial forces. In a lot of places the Soviets were the only ones willing to help independence movements so they fostered good will toward Moscow.

My point, its not surprising people in a lot of former colonized nations would eat up Russian propaganda about Western expansionism because it makes perfect sense even if its completely wrong. Its all about perception.

Russia stated early that they had destroyed all Ukrainian combat aircrafts. However, 100 days later the Ukrainians are still flying sorties. Do you still believe the Russian reports without any form of evidence? According to Oryx Ukraine has lost 22 combat aircrafts so far.

Ukraine claims that they have destroyed more than 200 Russian combat aircrafts. Russia have only lost Su-25, Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35’s during the war, and I’ve not seen any reports about other planes being spotted either. Which probably means that they don’t use any other variants in Ukraine. They have 507 (Su-25, Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35) in total. If Ukraine has downed 200+ it means that 40% of their planes are gone. Do you think it’s realistic that they have lost 2 aircrafts each day? I don’t. According to Oryx the Russian air craft loses are 29, and I will take that a fact until you (or someone else) can prove him wrong.

Ofcourse the loses are higher than 22 and 29 loses. But they are not 85% higher (Ukrainian claim). As I said earlier, downed aircrafts is a big victory.

You can find plenty of articles, that show there are quite a few issue with how the food industry operates. Technology has enabled us to produce abundant amounts of food.

Also this - Just as a US reference.

The federal poverty level, set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the minimum amount of money the bureaucrats in Washington think a family needs each year to afford the basic necessities of life: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Even most capitalist economists consider anything below twice that amount to be “low income.” No wonder, then, that the number of people in the United States living in households considered “food insecure” — meaning they have limited or uncertain access to enough food for every person to live an active, healthy life — is far greater. In fact, an estimated one in nine people in this country struggle with hunger.

On Tuesday, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached its 100-day mark, the United States government announced that it would send powerful new artillery systems to Ukrainian troops fighting in the country’s southeastern and eastern fronts, as well as radar systems and a number of additional weapons as the war condenses into a brutal slog to push Russia out of the Donbas and surrounding areas.

The four M142 HIMARS, high mobility artillery rocket systems, and associated ammunition, in this case the Unitary guided multiple launch rocket system or GMLRS, will supplement the shorter-range howitzers that the US, France, Britain, and Germany have sent to Ukraine in recent months and allow the Ukrainian armed forces to better keep the Russian military at a distance.

President Biden announced the new weapons and aid package in a New York Times guest essay, saying that the US would send “more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine,” without mentioning specifically which weapons would be deployed. In a June 1 press conference, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl announced that the HIMARS, which can hit targets in the range of over 70 kilometers away, were included in the package, as well as five counter-surveillance radars and two air surveillance radars.

Russian officials, for their part, have claimed that the new weapons package represents a provocation from the west. “We believe that the United States is deliberately and diligently ‘pouring fuel on the fire,’” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, claiming that, “Such deliveries do not contribute to … the Ukrainian leadership’s willingness to resume peace talks,” according to the Washington Post.

We’re looking at a dramatically different war than in the beginning of the invasion

The HIMARS have been at the top of Ukraine’s wish list, even more so than the fighter jets they were calling for in the beginning of the war. That’s because, as Rita Konaev, deputy director of analysis at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told Vox, the battlefield has changed dramatically as Russia shifted and reorganized its assets to fight in the Donbas region. That means a move away from urban environments, where poor planning on Russia’s part weakened its offensive, and Ukrainian troops familiar with the territory had the advantage.

“It’s increasingly clear that no one side is winning the war,” Konaev said. As opposed to the fast-moving initial weeks of the invasion, when outsiders thrilled to the idea of the scrappy Ukrainian forces dealing blow after surprising blow to the bigger, better-kitted Russian forces. But the fight for the Donbas has become “a war of a mile a day,” she said, a back-and-forth battle over territory more like World War I than the fast-paced campaigns of February and March.

“That phase of the war is over,” Konaev said. “This phase is more grinding, piecemeal.” Because of the radical shift in the nature of the battlefield, the weapons on offer have to change dramatically, too.

“I think the impetus for sending the HIMARS is twofold,” she told Vox. First, she said, the new weapons systems provide “greater standoff capabilities” — the ability to keep battlefield distance between two forces — about double that of the howitzer. Second, HIMARS represent “a massive upgrade in firepower,” she told Vox, adding that when used strategically, the “impact is similar to airstrike lethality.”

The Russian military has its own MLRS, but as John Spencer, the chair of urban warfare studies with the Madison Policy Forum and author of Connected Soldiers told Vox, “our weapons are farther reaching, more accurate” than the Soviet-designed systems.

But as of now — without the advanced weapons systems the US has promised Ukraine — Russia has some clear battlefield advantages, Konaev said.

“It’s not that Russia has gotten better,” she said, “it’s just a concentrated force [in an area] more amiable to Russian strengths.” Because the fighting is much closer to Russia’s territory, “there are shorter supply lines, and limited airstrikes used more effectively — they can run these quick ops and head back to base,” with a lower-risk, higher-reward calculus.

“In Donbas, the battles are happening at greater distances,” Spencer explained. Right now, Ukrainian troops “are really hampered in terms of range,” he told Vox. “If you know where a target is, you have to be able to reach it.” In other words, Ukraine may have the intelligence about where a crucial Russian target is, but a howitzer just can’t get there without putting Ukrainian troops at increased risk.

“At this moment in the war, this makes the most sense,” Spencer said of sending the HIMARS.

Here’s how the HIMARS could help shift Ukraine’s advantage

However, the new systems aren’t immediately going to win the war for Ukraine. “I don’t think these [HIMARS] will provide overnight change,” Spencer told Vox, but once they get on the battlefield, the four systems could help Ukrainian troops “regain momentum,” he said. Konaev agreed, telling Vox, “we won’t see the impact for at least another month.”

Although the Pentagon would not disclose whether the systems had yet been delivered to Ukraine, citing “operational security reasons,” Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth confirmed that, “We did pre-position the HIMARS systems in Europe to ensure that they can be rapidly delivered.”

After the weapons do make it to Ukrainian troops, it will take around three weeks for them to be trained on the systems, before they’re put to use on the battlefield against Russian forces. On Friday, it appeared that moment couldn’t come quickly enough, as Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu threatened to “accelerate” Russia’s “special military operation,” in a meeting with Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov. According to a briefing from the Institute for the Study of War, Shoigu didn’t provide specifics but in their assessment, Russian forces will likely be unable to launch more advanced operations given the enormous investment in equipment and troops it would take.

However, Ukrainian losses are piling up, with between 60 and 100 soldiers dying each day, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech this past week. And Russia has ramped up its scorched-earth tactics in the Donbas, pummeling cities like Severodonetsk — preventing evacuations and resupply, in a nightmarish repeat of its siege of Mariupol.

“The Russian massing of fighters [in the Donbas has] turned momentum briefly,” Spencer told Vox, although he predicted that getting the HIMARS onto the battlefield “will result in more dead Russian generals” — translating to an ever-more disorganized Russian fighting force. “The path to victory is unraveling.”

Both Spencer and Konaev told Vox that intelligence on the Ukrainian side will play a decisive role in any gains in territory or defeat of Russian forces, as it has so far in the war. “The most important impact has been intel,” Konaev said, giving Ukrainian forces “the ability to protect themselves, and pre-empt attacks on supply lines.” Radar systems will augment that intelligence, with air surveillance radars and HIMARS disrupting Russia’s ability to command air dominance.

But right now, mitigating shelling from the Russian side could have a much greater impact on the battlefield — and on the safety of civilians. “Russian artillery has caused the greatest damage,” Konaev explained, leveling cities like Maruiopul and Severodonetsk, and the combination of the counter-artillery radars and the mobile, longer-range weapons will hopefully prevent Russia from “ruling the rubble,” as Spencer put it — claiming victory by subduing and destroying population centers.

The future of the war may include different weapons but more of the same grind

Biden’s op-ed reiterated his position throughout the war — that the US and NATO are not seeking a war with Russia, and that the US will continue arming Ukraine because it’s the right thing to do, but it’s still not quite clear, at least from the op-ed, how far that will go. Considering just how grueling and grinding the war is now, the field seems open in terms of additional weapons the US will supply, which, as Kahl pointed out in his Wednesday press conference, could include more HIMARS.

Whatever additional resources are on the way, the summer will likely be just as grinding, bloody, and devastating as the past few weeks have been, as a recent Politico feature acknowledges. Even if Ukraine is able to turn on the offense and begin retaking land, it will be slowly — piecemeal, position by position and village by village, said Serhiy Haidai, the head of the military government in Luhansk, one of the regions that makes up the Donbas. Until then, Russian forces are raining down artillery and making incremental advances; as Haidai said to Politico, “they are destroying everything and then moving through the ruins.”",3cb76f3021e5f1e07ce6ffca2148c2f9c83770a5,True,False,,,,,0,1654435415,,0,{},ib90hzw,False,t3_v5cglm,False,True,t3_v5cglm,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5cglm/how_ukraines_new_weapons_reflect_a_very_different/ib90hzw/,1654435432,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654406615.0,

And to be clear, none are there, and NATO, at least before February 2022, didn't ever plan to put them there. And before 2014, NATO didn't even consider it necessary, to have any significant troops in the new eastern member states, it was only ever a very small rotated contingent.

So you can't compare the two situations at all - Ukraine in NATO wouldn't - even if NATO would put missiles there, raise the risk for Russia in a significant way by that, compared to missiles in Poland or the Baltics or the Balkans, while missiles in Cuba would change much for the US. In addition to that, there are nearly no NATO nuclear missiles outside the nuclear nations anymore, it is only nuclear participation (with bombs, and that't more a show...), and there is zero reason to think that was planned to be extended to any further nations.

And then - the chances that Ukraine would become a NATO member in the next decade, even decades, were close to zero in early 2022. All NATO-members need to agree on that, and not just the leadership, even the parliaments for ratification in most of them. Like roughly 50% of the members don't really wanted Ukraine in NATO (even if many didn't say it that clear or loud), _one_ vetoing it is enough. So even that is not a real risk for Russia.

To get more real, from a ""realist"", geopolitical, topographic point of view, like e.g. by Karaganov, indeed Ukraine is the military highway for NATO to Moscow, but that's related to a huge, conventional land war. That's not false if NATO would start such a war. But - this completely misses the point ""realists"" often miss, that that's surely possible in theory, but it is politically impossible for the West to start such a war, and NATO doesn't even have the correct forces for that and it didn't (and still doesn't) arm in that direction. 

It is pretty delusional to see that - in a comprehensive, actually realist, and not just ""realist"", view, as an actual problem.

In reality NATO is indeed restricting the Russia Federation in the sense that it is an IR-liberal organization, and it prevents old-style spheres of influence and power politics, and it makes a non-power-politics, soft hard competition possible (which the Russian Federation played very bad in the near abroad) but there was zero risk that NATO will attack the Russian Federation militarily.",792ae3d74d2eac4d33745a39fb47444f50be788b,True,False,,,,,0,1654434507,,0,{},ib8yzoj,False,t3_v5b26w,False,True,t1_ib8ul9b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5b26w/dont_romanticise_the_global_south_its_sympathy/ib8yzoj/,1654434521,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654405707.0,

Further its incredibly embarrassing for Germany to tied itself so thoroughly to Russian energy dependence.

I explained how your statement was factually wrong and exposed your dishonesty, it's not that I only ""confirmed specifics"". So yeah, the naval chief had to resign with good reasons, what's your point? What your second point is concerned, I'm completely with you. The lack of alternatives in gas supply is a huge miscalculation.

&gt; My heritage is German, I'm embarrassed by the choices my home country has been making.

I don't know what your heritage has to do with Germany and its population. 

&gt; Put it all to rest by listing the actual German military aid that has delivered to Ukraine. Not pledged, not promised, but ACTUALLY delivered. 

Of course Germany delivered military aid already, as early as February. It's a shame we haven't sent heavy aid yet, but this is in process right now. 
Please tell my why Germany deserves special attention, when it's not the only country which hasn't yet delivered all the aid it promised?

What do people like you think when you point these things out, but don't put into perspective what other countries did or could do and why? Like the issue wasn't much more complicated and most of the things are coordinated among NATO members. Why hasn't the US delivered M1 Abrams? Or the UK Challengers? Why do people only point out that Germany hasn't yet delivered Leopards? 

You ask why we haven't delivered more aid than Estonia? First you should check that this is not the case. Secondly, you should question why only old Soviet equipment is sent by most countries.

I pretty sure this is not only ignorance, but deliberate misinformation. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Russian litigants fighting cases in London’s High Court are being forced to find new representation as the biggest UK-based law firms are increasingly refusing to act for them in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Lawyers at some of the top London firms have warned the wider fallout from UK and other western sanctions targeting those close to the Kremlin could spell the end to the heyday of big ticket Russian litigation in the capital. Adam Greaves, litigation practitioner at law firm LK Law, said that City law firms had started to conduct a “sniff test” on potential Russian clients irrespective of whether they face sanctions as a result of the war in Ukraine. He added that he did not foresee certain Russian work returning to London in the long term and suggested it would shift to places such as Dubai or Singapore. “There are signs that law firms are steering clear of Russian work and are thinking twice about it partly for reputational reasons,” added Jonathan Fisher QC, a barrister at Red Lion Chambers. In the past, Russians litigants have flocked to London’s High Court attracted by the independence of the judiciary and a robust legal system that unlike the US does not use juries to try civil cases, which makes the outcome more predictable. Big law firms, which typically make less than a quarter of their profits from all litigation, are technically permitted to act for sanctioned Russian clients but only if they first receive a special government licence. Jonathan Fisher QC says there are signs law firms are steering clear of Russian work © Charlie Bibby/FT But as the west increasingly severs its links with Russia and targets those linked to the regime of president Vladimir Putin, law firms, which are typically partnerships owned by the most senior lawyers, are turning their backs on one of their more lucrative client bases. Russians were the second-largest group of litigants by nationality, after British citizens, to use the English courts to settle commercial disputes in the 12 months to March 2022, according to a survey by Portland Communications. It found that there were 21 cases involving Russian litigants, including four brought by Russia state-owned bank VTB. Several high profile cases have already been affected due to law firms dropping their Russian clients. In April, Freshfields told the High Court it had ceased to act for VTB, which was sanctioned earlier this year. It had been acting for the bank, which is a defendant in a case brought by the Republic of Mozambique over the so-called “tuna bonds” scandal, where the country borrowed from investors purportedly to fund maritime projects. The case is set for trial next year. Freshfields, which declined to comment, had previously condemned the Russian invasion in March. VTB did not respond to a request for comment. White &amp; Case, a US law firm, told the High Court in April it was going to stop representing the Russian Federation in another case due to be heard later this year. The firm said in a statement it was “ceasing all representations” of Russian state and state-owned entities and those of Belarus, the Kremlin’s closest ally. The lawsuit relates to a case brought in London’s High Court by ex-shareholders in Yukos against the Russian state over claims Moscow had unlawfully expropriated the assets of the former Russian oil company. The lawsuit to enforce an arbitration award was put on hold while a parallel case was heard in the Netherlands. Ed Crosse, a past president of the London Solicitors Litigation Association and a partner at law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons, said that while the war in Ukraine would have a bearing, there would still be legal representation available. “There will be fewer lawsuits coming to London from Russian companies and Russian litigants, who may now find it difficult to get lawyers to represent them, although there are still some boutique law firms that are actively seeking out Russian disputes work,” he said. Crosse said he thought the risk of losing Russian clients was overstated, certainly in terms of profits generated by most law firms, adding that money could be made from work generated by the war, particularly in terms of providing advice on sanctions and regulatory issues. “There should be limited impact on law firm profits because, for most firms, Russian related litigation was not that significant — firms may have just one or two partners who have Russia as their focus,” he added. But those on the other side of legal disputes involving Russian clients worry that law firms turning their backs on Russian clients now seen as pariahs in the west will leave them struggling to pursue their claims and gain access to justice. Tim Osborne, the chief executive of GML, a company representing ex-shareholders in Yukos, is facing this issue in both jurisdictions where he is pursuing Moscow. Dutch lawyers representing Russia in the other case in Amsterdam have also recently walked away from their client. “It definitely benefits the Russian Federation. Our case started in 2005 and the defendants have sought to delay at every opportunity,” he said. London law firms are now looking at court decisions in other jurisdictions including a recent ruling made by a British Virgin Islands court, which sent shockwaves through the legal world. Mr Justice Adrian Jack, sitting in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, refused an application by law firm Ogier, which did not respond to a request for comment, to stop acting in another lawsuit involving VTB Bank. The judge said in his ruling: “VTB may be a pariah. It is precisely when VTB is stigmatised as a pariah that VTB needs the best endeavours of their legal representatives to advise them. Even pariahs have rights.”",4a1f4dcc5308614c563b5b4704316b9f6349e041,True,False,,,,,0,1654431924,,0,{},ib8uzn6,False,t3_v5a5pe,False,True,t3_v5a5pe,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5a5pe/russian_litigants_left_struggling_to_find_lawyers/ib8uzn6/,1654431942,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654403124.0,

The source of imperialism, the source of fascism is not Putin, but Russian people. 

They did what they did and act in this manner precisely because of the lack of humiliation for their past wrongdoings.  They live in a parallel universe where they did never anything wrong in history. They live in a universe where starving millions of Ukrainians to death and omitting genocide of Crimean Tatars is perfectly ok, and nobody in the world criticizes them for that or calls them to acknowledge the crimes of Soviet past. In fact denying that Holodomor was a genocide is perfectly acceptable in a lot of circles.

Instead we saw contrary, we saw your ""sensitivity"", constant handshaking with literal fucking KGB agent,  constant appeasement, money and reputation laundering services in Europe for these bastards no matter how many people they kill. Imagine if today nobody in Germany would condemn national socialists and 70%+ of Germans had a positive view of Hitler like Russians view Stalin today? Instead these absolute morons kept asking Putin what he wants not to feel offended, and as a result you see them doing what they want with Ukraine what they wanted to do for ages, what they did in Soviet Union too, Putin has been saying ""we are one people"" (which means Ukrainians do not exist) for ages. This all has gone past European leaders ears of course, why would THEY care, they are not Ukrainian, right?

 Instead, he felt that ""diplomacy"", ""never ending dialogue"" of Sarkozies, Makrons, Shroedders, Merkels and Sholzes of the world as a reassurance in his impunity, as an allowance, as a cart blanche, an invitation for further action, of course, why not? Putin understands, that the ""free world"", values, freedom is a myth, half of Europeans care only for themselves and their fat pockets,  business as usual, they couldn't give two shits about some weird eastern Europeans if it threatens their comfy lives in any minor way or delusions about being great diplomatic superpowers. People borderline say it openly right now, you don't even have to read between the lines, they value lives of Easter Europeans less than Western Europeans. These are not the majority, but there are such people.

Yes, this is all well and good. 

The size of Ukraine's active army is somewhere around 200,000-250,000. 

They announced a general mobilization a while ago. The problem is that while Russia will be able to field an army of 350,000-400,000, Ukraine will not able to do the same. You can use those mobilized reserves to replace casualties, but a large scale reinforcement in order to conduct offensive operations doesn't look like it's going to materialize. Maybe they push the size of the army to 300,000. But I think that is the absolute maximum. 

Russia, with a partial mobilization, can almost definitely get the size of its army in Ukraine to 350,000-400,000 equipped troops. 

So, this situation is not exactly sunshine and rainbows. Every day that goes by is another day that mobilization in Russia continues. Upgraded T-64s are being pulled out of storage and all those troops being equipped to a decent standard, along with artillery systems and all the rest of the gear required for the war. 

But I don't see an equivalent on the Ukrainian side in terms of standardized, well supplied gear.

No people wanting peace with Ukraine and the West ?

You still seem to confuse terms, at no point he's talking about stopping supporting Ukraine nor letting Russia keep the territories it invaded. It's never good to humiliate a country that lost, never, it only creates instability, anger, seek of revenge, and prevents any reconciliation between countries. And as french, we know it very well since we did that mistake by the past, and it costed a lot to the World.

So even in 1942, there would have been no problem at saying that the responsible of the war are the nazi leaders and elite, and that once their agression is pushed back and army defeated, they would have to rebuild a new peace with a pacified Germany, which is what they did. Saying something like this wouldn't have mean that they wanted to let Hitler win anything!

I don't see how reminding such a basic, yet very important, thing about how to treat a defeated country would help Putin, since at no points it means that France is stopping to help Ukraine, nor that France is getting tired to help, nor that France wants Ukraine to stop its claims. And no, it's not a respond to the Ukrainian conditions (which France always approved and agreed with), it's just something important to remind since we get to see more and more people (like in this sub, just look at the comments), including people in power, wanting to crush Russia as an entity, wanting to treat Russia like Russia wants to (and already start to) treat Ukraine, having the same state of mind as french people in 1919, which is dangerous in the long term.

He already said the same thing earlier in May, that we will have to build peace after the conflict, that this peace will have to be build with Ukraine and Russia around the table if we want a stable peace, and not ""giving in to the tentation of spirit of revenge nor even humiliation"" because it always made it impossible for the path of peace, but that until then, european countries ""has to do anything they can to help Ukraine hold against Russia and make sure Russia can never win"" that war. In this context, he's talking about the after, and that's what he's still trying to do, that even in the most difficult times, we should never exclude diplomacy and never stop thinking about the after. But at no moment that means he wants Ukraine to give up a piece of its territory.

It's tiring to see how people can't understand such a basic thing and how they can't do two things at the same time.

&gt; Yes, I had seen The Buddha of Suburbia, in which white English couples fall for the fake mysticism of a bluffing “guru” in Bromley. I had read Paul Theroux on the power of the African continent to “bewitch the credulous”. It was not until later, though, as a working and dating adult, that I saw up close (and profited from) the western romanticisation of — now, what shall we call it?

&gt; “Third world” is rude. “Developing world” implies that all countries have the same teleological destiny. “Global south”, though it will have to do, is a geographic nonsense, encompassing as it does the northern hemisphere’s India and Middle East. In the end, the name of the place is less the issue here than the goodwill, the moral benefit of the doubt, that it tends to get from rich-world liberals.

&gt; Or, at least, used to get. No event this century has done as much as the Ukraine war to expose the difference in outlook between the west and — another phrase that doesn’t fit — the “rest”. Anglosphere, European and Japanese sanctions should not be mistaken for a truly global front against Vladimir Putin. In the latest Democracy Perception Index, an international survey, Russia retains a net positive reputation in Egypt, Vietnam, India and other countries that arouse fuzzy feelings in a certain kind of western breast. As for Morocco, another staple of the gap-year trail, Ukraine recalled its ambassador in March after failing to extract enough support from it. Pro-Russia protests have flared up in west and central Africa.

&gt; All of this is well within the prerogative of what are, after all, sovereign countries. Nor is it all that hard to account for. Some of it stems from their resentment of the west’s own record of conquest, from Robert Clive to the younger George Bush. The rest reflects cold national interest, and there is no disgrace there. Russia is a valuable patron.

&gt; But if these nations are free to reach judgments of their own, so is the west. It might respond to the present crisis by shedding its sentimental illusions about (yet a fifth term for it) the “majority world”. 

&gt; I know this sentimentality as only a frequent beneficiary of it could. The harmless side of it is a kind of cultural dabbling: the half-understood eastern fads, the “challenging” holidays instead of Antibes again. But it can very quickly go from there to the soft racism of holding non-white nations to a lower moral standard.

&gt; I cannot be alone in knowing someone who boycotted the US during the Trump years while visiting semi-democracies and gay-criminalising kingdoms with a cloudless conscience. In the aftermath of empire, it made sense to attribute special virtue to recently subjugated peoples, even if VS Naipaul saw through it. To keep it up forever starts to look like its own kind of paternalism.

&gt; With luck, the war will be a clarifying moment. Decolonisation, apartheid, Live Aid, Drop the Debt: western liberals have been able to live a human lifetime without going against the global south on a large moral question. (The denialism about Aids in Africa around the turn of the millennium is the nearest thing to an exception.)

&gt; The past few months have ended that convenient run. To stand up for Ukraine now, one must be willing to knock the halo off a lot of countries. It means wading against half a century of postcolonial theory about where moral authority lies in the world. It is easy, and right, to implore the likes of France and Germany to do more for Ukraine. It is more transgressive to suggest that poorer nations are being cavalier in their attitude to the global order or selective in their opposition to imperialism.

&gt; But transgress we must. It is the truest egalitarianism. The ongoing project to find a collective name for poorer countries shows how sensitivities have got in the way of truth and plain-speaking. That this is a nuisance for the west hardly needs saying. The larger point is that the global south loses, too, by way of infantilisation. Nothing is as first-world as being treated as a grown-up.",cc0f6e49d24896c0fe2abf1d3d8a2d344a4cae2a,True,False,,,,,0,1654427045,,0,{},ib8ojwt,True,t3_v5b26w,False,True,t3_v5b26w,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5b26w/dont_romanticise_the_global_south_its_sympathy/ib8ojwt/,1654427056,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654398245.0,

Proto-slavic language was not created. It has developed. As did Russian, as one of its child dialects. The language that is currently called Ukrainian, was a ""way of speech"", not even a dialect, specific to to people that were called 'maloross' in days of Russian Empire. Even a word for language - ""mova"" in Ukrainian, in all other slavic languages mean ""speech"" or ""manner of speech"".

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

*Is this bot monarchist?*

No, just pedantic.

It's clear that Germany withheld any support for Ukraine because Germany believed the invasion would be over within a very short period of time and their precious Nord2 pipeline would continue to move forward and Germany didn't want to upset Russia.

The processing power capable of performing such tasks with ease have only been commercially available for about 10 or so years. 

We use 5nm and 7nm chipsets now. There's even a 2nm processor likely to hit market in 2025-2026. These do not require a lot of power and perform billions of calculations a second. The jump from 7nm to 2nm already looks like a 45% increase in efficiency. That's lightyears ahead of a 90nm chip. If Russia want to stay relevant in the next 15 years, they need to find a way to;

A. Agree a deal with highend chip manufacturers (unlikely)

B. Create their own FAB (expensive and requires immense expertise, braindrain isn't helping).

C. Over-engineer all future tanks or smart military technology in order to try to compete with western military hardware (only feasible short term, obselete by 2030).


Chip shortages are devestating to any developing nation, and even for developed nations like Russia. They wont be able to make high end fighter jets or tanks. The T14 isn't happening anytime soon.

*ROMAN PETRENKO — SUNDAY, 5 JUNE 2022, 11:26*  
  
*Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk Oblast Military Administration, has said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine controls exactly half of Sievierodonetsk.*  
  
*Source: Haidai during the 24/7 national newscast*  
  
*Quote from Haidai: ""The Russians did control 70% of Sievierodonetsk, but within two days they were pushed back, and the city has been divided in half \[in terms of control\].*  
  
*They are afraid to roam the city so freely.""*  
  
*Details: According to Haidai, the occupiers have lost a huge number of personnel, with eight Russians taken prisoner.*  
  
*Haidai explained that all the reserves of the aggressors’ army are focused on seizing Sievierodonetsk and the main Lysychansk-Bakhmut road.*  
  
*Background:*  
  
*According to the American Institute for War Studies, Russian forces can still capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, but Ukraine's defence remains strong in this key position.*  
  
*Fighting is currently continuing on the streets of Sievierodonetsk, and the Russians have forcibly deported some of the residents of Sievierodonetsk to the occupied territories.*",8efa5768e8148541f1ea0e851cd3b9b42f59f827,True,False,,,,,0,1654423591,,0,{},ib8kpy4,True,t3_v5a8o3,False,True,t3_v5a8o3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5a8o3/haidai_armed_forces_of_ukraine_control_half_of/ib8kpy4/,1654423607,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654394791.0,

They probably need to apply in person at the consulate.  Mexico can be a bit bureaucratic even for Mexicans, but they are generally pretty welcoming.  

Mexico’s neutrality helped them mediate a solution to the Cuban Missiles Crisis in 1962, the closest the United States and the Soviet Union ever came to nuclear war.  And Mexico could fulfill that same role again.

Highly skilled Mexican diplomat Gilberto Bosques was a personal friend of Castro and trusted by both the Russians and the Americans and became a chief facilitator of communication between Cuba and the two superpowers and was critical in diffusing tensions.  So, here another story of a man who save the world, Gilberto Bosques.  

Bosques is also known as the “Mexican Schindler.”  He saved over 40,000 Jews from the Holocaust while working as a diplomat in France during WW II.

I think Mexico would be a good choice for a mediator in this current conflict.  Diplomats on all sides of this conflict would do well to use Mexico to help establish diplomatic back channels now. Although they have offered to mediate, Turkey is not really neutral as they are a member of NATO.  Mexico would be a better choice, again.

Do I sound like a proud Mexican?  I am not Mexican, but I am proud of Mexico and travel there a lot.  It is a great country.  They have always taken in a lot of European refugees going back to the Spanish Civil War up to and including today’s crisis in Ukraine.

Ask Mexico to mediate. Use them start back channels of communication now, as soon as possible.  They helped resolve this crisis before and they are capable of doing it again.

There are still unconfirmed informations going around, but sources say that Russians lost pretty much all of the elite forces there.

You said:

&gt; all the countries you listed did not do anything prior to 2022. 

Do nothing is very easy to disprove as it is boolean. If even 1 euro was sent, then your assumption is wrong. Let's see if quick google can find something to disprove this outrageous claim. I will not even put much energy into it, I just check if your claim is easily proven false.

As you can see every listed country did more then nothing. Except of course if you have some bizarre definition of ""nothing"" that nobody else has heard about. Just in case, check this link what nothing means: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nothing

A full list of acceptable donations can be found on our event website - http://www.a2food4ukraine.org/
We will have a Live Band, DJ and variety of fun activities on site for all ages to come and enjoy.
Bring an appetite! Side Biscuit along with a variety of other food vendors will be preparing Ukrainian, and other cuisines while offering a portion of their proceeds in support of this event.
We will also have a variety of ways to send a message to our friends in Ukraine. Painting the container, along with hand written notes to be included with your donation.
Local Artist Shingo Brown will be painting a mural live on one side of the container while the public is invited to draw on the other.

As Russians are apparently not allowing lightly wounded soldiers to leave Ukraine, we should round that number down somewhat. It still means that those 124k are either dead or can't take part on the offensive, lightly wounded being posted in the rear or guard duty.

Story I heard/read back in the first few weeks of the war was they had somehow managed to get access to hospital records in the areas bordering Ukraine. Hospital capacity/bed/icu numbers aren't really considered high level secret information, those numbers were being reported constantly during Covid worldwide. So all they would have to do is access that plus the records from before the invasion to get an idea of the normal operating tempo then compare those to how they're currently operating and you've got an idea of how many seriously wounded are in each hospital. Also they can probably access the morgue records as those are usually attached to hospitals, do the same process and you know how many KIA, or dying from wounds, are being processed through that facility. Add that to proven KIA still on the battlefield or in Ukrainian morgues and you've got a pretty good idea of how many troops Russia is losing. 

I can't prove that though, information on that has been scarce to come by on google, the UK intelligence services won't be publicly releasing how they got their information until well after this is over, so take my story with a grain of salt.

I watched this one yesterday.

The core of the conflict seems to be, again, oil and gas.

Problem is, with all these oil and gas revenues, they failed to build a real economy, with real grassroots industry and knowledge. There were some attempts. But still too much was stolen out of the country.

The main problem there: you can not build such an economic system based on authoritarianism. You need the creativity of ALL people. Not just a few bosses.

Same reason why the Ukrianians are so hellbent on killing officers. Without them nothing happens anymore.

In the 90s there were a few huge NATO excersises in Germany. Dutch army came out very well. If you interrupt the chain of command, nothing much changed.

The Spanish Army will instruct the Ukrainian military in Latvia and on national territory in the handling of tanks in their fight against the Russian invasionThe Spanish Army will instruct the Ukrainian military in Latvia and on its own territory in the handling of tanks in their fight against the russian invasion.
Spain is willing to make a qualitative leap in its military support to Ukraine against the Russian invasion, according to government sources. If until now it had delivered ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons (C-90 grenade launchers or machine guns), it is now preparing the supply of heavy weapons, with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks, and the essential training of the Ukrainian military.
The Ministry of Defense is already finalizing the delivery to Kyiv of a battery of short range Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish Army has replaced with another more advanced system. The shipment of this material, produced by the European missile company MBDA, is pending completion of the negotiations through a cell in Stuttgart (Germany) that is in charge of coordinating military aid to Ukraine to avoid lack of equipment and duplication of others.
The Spanish Government is also willing to deliver to Ukraine the Leopard A4 combat tanks that have been hibernating for a decade at the logistics base of the Spanish Army in Zaragoza. These tanks are part of the batch of 108 second-hand units that Germany sold to Spain in 1995, as a prelude to the Leopard manufacturing contract in Spain. Defense's intention was to convert them into recovery cars for engineers but, given the lack of budget, they opted to subject them to a dehumidification process (remove batteries, oils and any other element that could deteriorate them) and leave them in storage waiting to be disposed of. Defense sources estimate that some 40 cars could be rehabilitated and delivered to the Ukrainian Army, but they warn that this would require subjecting them to a fine-tuning by an industry that is unlikely to undertake these works at a time when there are calls for the general increase in military spending in Europe.
In addition, Spain has offered Ukraine to instruct its military in the handling of these battle tanks. The training, according to the sources consulted, would initially take place in Latvia, where the Spanish Army has deployed a contingent of 500 soldiers with six Leopard 2E tanks, within the framework of NATO's Enhanced Advanced Presence (EFP) operation. In a second phase, the training of the Ukrainian tankers would already be done in Spanish territory. This program would allow the preparation plans of the Kyiv Army to equip itself with powerful combat tanks which are able to face the modern Russian T-90, since now they only have a center in Germany to be instructed in their handling.
The offer of the missiles and the instruction of the tankers was raised when the President of the Government, Pedro Sánchez, traveled to Kyiv on April 21 and met with President Zelenskyy, but it has been delayed due to the complexity of the operation, according to the sources consulted. That same day, the Army ship Ysabel set sail from El Ferrol loaded with 200 tons of ammunition and missile supports. She was also carrying 30 trucks and 10 light vehicles that traveled 800 kilometers along Polish roads to bring the material to the reception base of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. This shipment represented, in the words of Sánchez, ""more than double"" the material sent until then in 11 military transport flights. On the occasion of the visit to Madrid this week by Igor Zhovkva, Zelenskyy's adviser, talks have been relaunched to speed up the delivery and expand the list of possible supplies.
At a press conference last Friday, on the occasion of the 100 days since the beginning of the invasion, the Ukrainian ambassador in Madrid, Serhii Pohoreltsev, thanked the military aid provided so far by Spain but considered it insufficient, warning that the ammunition it is only enough “for two hours of combat”. ""We are grateful but we cannot say that we are satisfied,"" he stressed.
The diplomatic representative of Kyiv asked for heavy weapons (anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, 155-millimeter howitzers or 120-mm mortars), but above all he demanded the delivery of Leopard tanks, even before instructing the Ukrainian military on how to use them. ""There is good will from the Spanish Government and the Ministry of Defense about sending instructors to teach the operation of these battle tanks, but the important thing is the tanks,"" he stressed. The ambassador insisted that his country does not ask for ""anything that Spain cannot contribute"" and complained that, according to his reports, Spain presents ""one of the lowest rates of military aid [to Ukraine] in relation to its defense budget""
The diplomat framed his request in the new phase of prolonged and attrition war in which the conflict has entered, with the occupation of 20% of its territory by Russian troops and the destruction of 30% of its infrastructure. And he assured that the Spanish government has shown ""indisputable support"" for the Kyiv cause and has not perceived ""pro-Russian sympathies"" within it, despite the criticism of the ministers of United We Can to the delivery of military material to Ukraine.
What the diplomat did not criticize is the reception in Spain of the 140,000 Ukrainians (women, children and the elderly) who have arrived fleeing the war, of which 116,000 have already obtained international protection status. ""The process has been well organized,"" he acknowledged.",5e3fd7b5aa978eeac90f8b1d70219e1cb4500c27,True,False,,,,,0,1654414593,,0,{},ib8b29p,False,t3_v57cdi,False,True,t1_ib86qwq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v57cdi/spain_is_ready_to_hand_over_antiaircraft_missiles/ib8b29p/,1654414607,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654385793.0,

When they have integrated relations and trade there is a real cost to causing problems, similar to the costs they're going through now domestically due to trade being cut off with many.

The issue is that quite a few actual experts have pointed out that Ukraine doesn't have sufficient weapons to reclaim lost territories.  And when the views of such actual experts are pointed out, the response from this forum tends to be:

a) you, the person who posted the analysis of the actual expert is an 'appeaeser'/'russian troll', etc.

b) ""but more weapons are coming"" in some handwavy way, ignoring the fact that the expert analysis has already considered this.

c) ""yes, but the ukrainian fighters will never stop fighting for their land"" hopium.

and now your bullshit take.

the great irony of it all is that those of us noting that ukraine doesnt have enough weapons (and hence are calling for many many more weapons for ukraine) have views which are a) consistent with those expressed repeatedly by the ukrainian military and civilian leadership b) is entirely pro-ukraine.  we WANT ukraine to win and so want it to have maximum resources.

I have different feelings then most on Russian KIA numbers. I believe the count that the UA DoD reports as pretty accurate. The Russians are known to kill there own wounded soldiers then packing them out and providing medical treatment. Those with superficial wounds are recovered because thay can get back in the fight later on. Those with significant wounds are shot by the officers so as not to be a burden. This also effects the Russians wounded numbers which I would estimate as 2x KIA not the usual 3x. 

I believe the Russians are doomed to fail. Their current rate of both human and equipment losses are not sustainable. This is observable by the introduction of old T62's to the theater and forcible conscription of DPR and LPR males as attackers, cannon fodder. If the UA has suckered  the RF into what appears to be a trap at Severodonetsk, and Putin continues to feed personnel and equipment into the grinder, it will only be a month or two for the inevitable collapse to occur.

You see on this post, we are bringing up ww2, insulting a war hero of the French or making light of him. And nobody is getting overly offended. France is also giving quite a lot of assistance to Ukraine, nothi by to scoff at relative to Germany.

What I don’t understand is why, with every to big we just said:

Why is it that any post about Germany before anything is even said there’s top comments circling the wagons saying “this anti German hatred is gettigg by old” “people need to stop bashing us” “this is Russian disinformation”

I just don’t get why  when it comes to just discussi mg policy of Germany there’s such a damn defence squad that turns up.

It was really interesting to see Ukraine doing the same but luckily with more devastating effects in the North and West earlier on as you may remember hearing about all the Russian command posts getting attacked and supposedly a lot of that was due to Ukraines own EW devices pinpointing those sites due to the high use of devices and communications.

Macron is not French leadership. Macron is a tiny man, he is weak.

But people will follow France if they are strong. What does French strength look like? French losses in war after war against peer adversaries, and appeasing statements? 

No.

An example would be: send French troops as a peacekeeping mission into Kyiv and Kyiv. Put them on the border between Belarus and Kyiv. Relieve Ukrainian troops and let Ukraine send those soldiers to the Donbass.

Europe is being attacked *right now*. Now is the time to fight, so that when their is peace the EU nations see how France lead in war. Clearly if France won’t send troops to defend Europe while it is being attacked, why would they do so when pretending to have a European army?

Because the French are weak, and they will never send troops to fight for Europe. Ever. And all other countries know this, so Macron and the French are not respected.

No one would care if France wouldn’t display weakness again and again to Putin through these statements. French weakness has prolonged this war for 8 years via Minsk I and Minsk II, and now they are trying to extend the war again.

However, I think it would be reasonable for Ukraine to ask Russia to return to 2014 lines in exchange for 10-20% of France.  America could escort Russians and give them safe passage to an area of Macron’s choosing as part of the deal.

&gt; ""shitty culture"" causes the current reign of organised crime cartels, as opposed to weak institutions, corrupt politicians, vast drug revenues, a totally dysfunctional colony inherited from Spain

What makes you think that weak institution, corrupt politicians, lack of respect for rule of law are something extra-cultural? They are all part of Mexican ""culture"" that contribute to the trouble they are in. Why do you think there are fewer drug gang related decapitations in US and Canada? Just because they had better geopolitical luck? Sometimes luck is what you make yourself. You cannot say that US was always lucky, they also have devastating Civil War...

&gt;But for an entire country? An entire people numbering tens of millions? That's just too simplistic, to put it very politely.

That's exactly when you can talk about culture, it's more of a statistical thing, you cannot talk about a person being how they are because of the culture, but you can talk about a country being as it is at least in big part because of their culture. 

&gt; Because the ordinary Afghan immigrant is the one who ends up getting blamed

See my point above, it's not about individual people or at least not treating people statistically (that's how racism works). Everybody is their own person based on their merits and faults not based on various groups they are part of (especially when belonging to the group is not a voluntary thing).

&gt;Was America a ""shithole country"" with ""shitty culture"" before that?

Yes, of course, even now there are shitty elements about American culture, but as a whole is much less shittier than Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Mexico, unless you perhaps have another opinion? 

&gt;Afghanistan isn't inherently a ""shithole country""

Never claimed that. No country in the world is inherently anything. As I mentioned before, I didn't even touched onto the ""why"", the thing is that it **IS** a shitty country and it **HAS** a shitty culture that stops or makes it very hard for them to get out of the shit. Think about Japan or Germany after the WWII, no matter how many billions you'd pour into Afghanistan it would still be a shitty place they would never become the next Germany or Japan or even South Korea. And talking about that, yes North Korea has a shitty culture too, although I don't know how deep or permanent the damage is, it will still probably take a few generations before they get to some normality back even if they get rid of their communist dynasty.",28c5fb167fb1f292afcf8745ae1b3d476916e97a,True,False,,,,,0,1654394250,,0,{},ib7hypz,False,t3_v4jkzh,False,True,t1_ib7blpf,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4jkzh/bond_between_americans_and_ukrainian_forces_they/ib7hypz/,1654394260,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654365450.0,

They are tired and depressed. **The Russians have drones to spot them and artillery to whack them.** Four tanks were taken out in an hour during their last sortie. I am struck by the age of these territorial defence volunteers — many in their fifties, like me. I’ve met a couple of ex-British forces guys in Ukraine training the territorials, and they’ve told me how they are taking raw recruits and giving them quick lessons in how to take up a firing position before sending them to the front. I’ve often thought how lucky I am to have lived in an age in which neither my father, nor I, nor, now, my son had to sign up for war. Did these volunteers once think that?

I think now might be the time to start building drones that have the capability to shoot down drones of similar speeds and capabilities. A 10 kg helicopter drone should be able to fly next to another helicopter drone, and shoot it down. This task could also be done by a model airplane-type drone equipped with a smart camera capable of recognizing helicopter drones at several km distance.",6dd75164b9d0d6be37ae205ab2c381d67aebf1ab,True,False,,,,,0,1654392553,,0,{},ib7ez89,False,t3_v4rxjq,False,False,t3_v4rxjq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4rxjq/lessons_in_resilience_from_the_people_of_a/ib7ez89/,1654392568,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654363753.0,

The world is no longer a war of all against all, with occasional pauses while the adversaries regain strength for the next attack.

Out of curiosity, do you believe that...

1) British/Christian ""shitty culture"" caused a decades-long sectarian terrorist conflict in Northern Ireland, more so than colonialism, the forcible separation of N. Ireland from the rest of Ireland without democratic legitimacy, as well as violent repression/persecution of Catholics and brutal policing?

2) American/Christian ""shitty culture"" caused the Ku Klux Klan to flourish and murder thousands of African-Americans, more so than segregation policy, low quality and racist education, the failure of Reconstruction, the purposeful stoking of the Lost Cause narrative, and political greed?

3) Indian/Pakistani ""shitty culture"" caused millions of deaths and tens of millions displaced during Partition, more so than corrupt politicians, a local Indian desire for British withdrawal immediately at all costs, a negligent British exit strategy, and general bad planning by all involved?

4) Mexican ""shitty culture"" causes the current reign of organised crime cartels, as opposed to weak institutions, corrupt politicians, vast drug revenues, a totally dysfunctional colony inherited from Spain, multiple civil wars, a French invasion/occupation, and the murder of any modern-day politician or journalist who tries to fix it?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I can point to any conflict in the history of the world and show you the detailed reasons why it happened, and it's not ""shitty culture"". It's a complicated melting pot of different factors. Now, you can say ""my old job had a shitty workplace culture"", sure, that's specific. But for *an entire country?* An entire people numbering tens of millions?

That's just too simplistic, to put it *very politely.*

Why does it matter? Because the ordinary Afghan immigrant is the one who ends up getting blamed. It becomes *his* fault, his people's fault, because they're dirty primitive barbarians with shitty culture. I've literally seen this happen so many times. I've sat at dinner tables in the UK with family and (ex) friends who call these people ""uncivilised"" and ""violent"". And all because they're too ignorant to understand why these conflicts happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You can only blame other countries, Britain, and imperialism so much 

That's why I also blamed corrupt politicans, a genocidal dictator, warlords, unemployment, poverty, and incompetent counter-insurgency practices.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;mistreating and not giving full rights to your women citizens for example (and that's just a small example)

Switzerland gave women the right to vote in 1971. Were they a ""shithole country""? It was legal in America to rape your own wife until 1975, and it didn't get outlawed in all states until 1993. Was America a ""shithole country"" with ""shitty culture"" before that?

Afghanistan was a functioning state in the mid-20th century. It was modernising technologically, women's rights were improving (slowly), the economy was growing, it was peaceful. It was also deeply autocratic and the king was unpopular. A revolution ousted the king, all of the bubbling insecurities exploded, the Soviets invaded, and almost a decade of war followed, with weapons, money and troops pouring in from all over the world. The Soviet-Afghan war destroyed the country. Warlords emerged, heavily armed and funded by opium. Afghanistan isn't inherently a ""shithole country"", it's problems come from bad policies, invasions and instability.",7e44e95aac06b32c45c1872c92c53a2db77a1259,True,False,,,,,0,1654390654,,0,{},ib7blpf,False,t3_v4jkzh,False,True,t1_ib6yasy,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4jkzh/bond_between_americans_and_ukrainian_forces_they/ib7blpf/,1654390670,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654361854.0,

The two troopships taken up from trade (*Queen Elizabeth II* and *Canberra*). These carried the only troops that could take back Stanley. The Royal Navy kept them mainly down at St George Island, well out of range.

And the cargo ship taken up from trade, the *Atlantic Conveyor.* Her loss changed the war. It became a war more like the Korean War, without the vertical envelopment her helicopters would allow. The result was that the attacking Royal Marines and Paras had to trudge (""yomp"") nearly 60 miles to Stanley to close with the Argentinians. This march took time into the face of the closing Austral winter.  In Admiral Woodward's memoirs, he said he thought he had 10 fighting days left before the Brits were exhausted (""culminated"").

On the other hand, the Royal Navy had lost two destroyers and two frigates, one of which was sunk the same day as *Atlantic Conveyor*. The naval war was over almost before it started, and the air war was at an end. Only the land war remained.

“What China is trying to do is to be with Russia, signal neutrality publicly and not be compromised financially,” the U.S. official said. “Many of those goals are contradictory. It’s hard to fulfill them at the same time.”  
The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.  
China has called for an end to the war but has refused to join a global consortium of countries in imposing sanctions on Moscow, instead laying blame for the conflict on the United States and NATO expansion in Europe.  
“For a long time, China and Russia have maintained normal cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and energy. The problem is not who will help Russia bypass the sanctions, but that normal economic and trade exchanges between Russia and China have been unnecessarily damaged,” said Liu Pengyu, spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington.  
Liu added that the sanctions brought about a “lose-lose” situation for all parties and made “the already difficult world economy worse.”  
Beijing’s public support for Russia has not faltered. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to Moscow during a virtual meeting that was also attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Wang said China is willing to work with Russia to promote “real democracy,” alluding to a Chinese foreign policy goal of countering what it has described as U.S. hegemony in global politics.  
Russia has not requested “weapons and ammunition” to support its war, the Chinese officials said, but declined to comment on whether Russia had requested other items that could be used in military operations including technology and supplies.  
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States has not seen any “systematic effort” by China to help Russia evade sanctions, nor has it seen any significant military support from China to Russia.  
Biden warns China's Xi not to help Russia on Ukraine  
Blinken, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event commemorating the centennial of Foreign Affairs magazine, noted a “remarkable exodus of companies from Russia” as a result of the invasion — 7,800 companies, Blinken said, that “didn’t want their reputations to be at risk by doing business in Russia.”  
The sanctions themselves did not drive the exodus, Blinken said. “It was really companies deciding on their own that they were not going to do business as usual in a country that was committing this kind of aggression. That’s something I think that China also has to factor in as it thinks about its relationship with Russia.”  
China has balked at helping Russia evade sanctions, fearing the United States and it allies could cut China off from critical technology, including semiconductors and aerospace equipment, as well as target its financial system, a Beijing official said. Shipments of high-end Chinese technology to Russia — including smartphones, laptops and telecommunications equipment — have plummeted since the war began.  
Nonetheless, the Chinese maintain that the U.S. and Western sanctions are illegal and that China will continue to do business with Russia. “The Chinese side is willing to fulfill its commitments to the Russian side, and is doing that when suitable conditions are met,” said the person in Beijing familiar with the discussions.  
Asked about U.S. warnings that China would face consequences if it aids Russia, the person said, “The true reason is to sow discord between the Chinese side and the Russian side … that will not happen. They will not succeed in undermining the China-Russian relationship.”  
The Chinese official noted, however, that the war in Ukraine had dragged on much longer than expected, and Beijing has made clear to Moscow that an end to the conflict would allow China more leeway to oppose sanctions and grow business ties inside Russia in the wake of the exodus of foreign firms.  
Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said, “I think that the hope of the United States and Europe is that China will be forced to choose \[between siding with Russia or with the West\] and that it will make the right choice. But China has competing interests, and it will be virtually impossible to compel them to place their long-standing support for territorial integrity and sovereignty above their relationship with Russia.”  
Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, said “The whole purpose of standing with Russia is they want Russia to work with them in strategic alignment against the U.S.” But by abiding by Western sanctions, after all the public support it has given Russia, Beijing runs the risk of undermining its relationship with Moscow.  
A second Chinese official said that discussions among high-level officials have emphasized fast-tracking Russian ventures inside China to cement closer ties while minimizing the risk to Beijing. And open source documents show that Russian-linked projects inside China are forging ahead.  
Domestic Chinese bidding documents show that financing for new construction on the strategically significant Russia-China Eastern Route gas pipeline has continued since the war began, with fresh purchases for materials and machinery earmarked for the southern leg of the project. It is expected to provide 18.9 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to China’s economically vibrant Yangtze Delta region by 2025.  
China’s Institute of Atomic Energy in April also purchased new services and equipment from Russian nuclear engineering firm OKBM Afrikantov for the Russian-built China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) nuclear project near Beijing, documents show. In the same period, it purchased new supplies and services from Russian state atomic energy firm Rosatom for the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant, a landmark Sino-Russian project under construction in China’s Jiangsu province.  
Municipal and provincial governments have also been directed by Beijing to launch projects to expand trade and financial ties with Russia, according to the Beijing officials and domestic bidding documents filed in China.  
“Based on the comparative advantages of location and resources, we will analyze the favorable factors and obstacles of regional cooperation between Dalian and the Russian Far East … so as to promote the high-quality economic development,” stated one May 19 document outlining funding for research into investment opportunities in Russia for the northeastern Chinese manufacturing and port hub of Dalian, which is located close to the Russian border.  
Chinese officials also said senior leadership had called for new investment and trade with Belarus, which has been targeted with financial and defense sanctions linked to its supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
Bidding documents and contracts issued in April and May show Chinese companies continued to make shipments to the China-Belarus Industrial Park, a logistic hub outside Minsk, Belarus, that was created as part of strategic agreement between the two countries. Over half of the companies in the park are financed by China, according to data released in Chinese state media in May.  
Further bidding documents released on May 20 outline plans by a subsidiary of state-owned technology giant China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) to launch a $30 million project for a China-Belarus joint research laboratory that will study and test of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) equipment — a technology with military applications. The project includes an 11,000-square-foot research base and an array of EMP equipment.  
CETC and its subsidiaries have already been placed on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List, which restricts exports to listed companies, for their cooperation with the Chinese military.",3fed7a35598e89da69ba5b243cc830e0839ce505,True,False,,,,,0,1654388517,,0,{},ib77qfo,False,t3_v4zvxc,False,True,t1_ib77pb2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4zvxc/beijing_chafes_at_moscows_requests_for_support/ib77qfo/,1654388530,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654359717.0,

China’s leadership wants to expand assistance for Russia without running afoul of Western sanctions and has set limits on what it will do

Russian officials have raised increasingly frustrated requests for greater support during discussions with Beijing in recent weeks, calling on China to live up to its affirmation of a “no limits” partnership made weeks before the war in Ukraine began. But China’s leadership wants to expand assistance for Russia without running afoul of Western sanctions and has set limits on what it will do, according to Chinese and U.S. officials.

Moscow has on at least two occasions pressed Beijing to offer new forms of economic support — exchanges that one Chinese official described as “tense.” The officials familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

They declined to share specifics of Russia’s requests, but one official said it included maintaining “trade commitments” predating the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and financial and technological support now sanctioned by the United States and other countries.

“China has made clear its position on the situation in Ukraine, and on the illegal sanctions against Russia,” said a person in Beijing with direct knowledge of the discussions. “We understand \[Moscow’s\] predicament. But we cannot ignore our own situation in this dialogue. China will always act in the best interest of the Chinese people.”

China is in a bind as it seeks to help its most important strategic partner, which started a war that Beijing did not anticipate would now be entering its fourth month, Chinese and U.S. officials said. They said that President Xi Jinping has tasked his closest advisers to come up with ways to help Russia financially but without violating sanctions.

“That has been difficult,” said a senior U.S. official. “And it is insufficient from the Russian standpoint.”

The U.S. official said that China has tried to find “other opportunities” diplomatically, and through joint military exercises, to bolster Russia. Last week, Russia and China flew strategic bombers over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea while President Biden was in Tokyo, wrapping up his first trip to Asia. It was their first joint military exercise since the invasion of Ukraine and a pointed signal of the growing strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing.",95fd9e74dde2172f7fb9e32e05c752d995da6d77,True,False,,,,,0,1654388500,,0,{},ib77pb2,False,t3_v4zvxc,False,True,t3_v4zvxc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4zvxc/beijing_chafes_at_moscows_requests_for_support/ib77pb2/,1654388515,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654359700.0,

Yeah nope, the shortage is *that* bad https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/25/chip_shortage_report/

&gt; Following interviews with 530 engineers spanning the planet, Avnet said 93 percent of respondents are seeing delays in chip shipments, with longer lead times. A majority also expect chip prices to go up in the next 18 months.

&gt; Among the most problematic parts are microcontrollers (MCUs), with delays stretching 50 weeks. MCU demand also outstripped supply, which led to drastic price increases. Respondents said that MCU prices were ""more than 10 and even 20 times that of pre-pandemic pricing,"" according to the survey.

&gt; MCUs from companies like STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments have been in heavy demand. A popular STMicro MCU, the STM32F437VIT6, is on backorder at Digi-Key, and has a 65-week lead time on Mouser, while distributor Newark hopes to restock on the microcontroller in April next year.",09e1967d787eca0cd8ddfba1d0ae404686bd44a6,True,False,,,,,0,1654388351,,0,{},ib77f7j,False,t3_v4xu40,False,True,t1_ib6xjax,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4xu40/everything_is_gone_russian_business_hit_hard_by/ib77f7j/,1654388367,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654359551.0,

&gt;First, it suggests that the boss of Chechnya has been far less successful in attracting Chechens to his units than he claims despite his use of repressive measure to get people of the republic under his control to “volunteer.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, it helps to explain conflicts between Kadyrov’s unit and others in the Russian invasion force such as the Buryats, something that may have less to do with hostility among non-Russians than with hostility between all non-Russians and the ethnic Russians who dominate the Russian command if not always its lower ranks.  
&gt;  
&gt;And third – and this is far and away the most important – it indicates that much of the brutality that the Kadyrov force has engaged in has less to do with Chechens than with Putin loyalist Kadyrov’s desire to show how tough he is, even if he has to do it with ethnic Russians who may be far more guilty than many suppose.",9ac02e6d1f6bd4470c7ef38f00b0924d1ed827b0,True,False,,,,,0,1654388329,,0,{},ib77ds8,True,t3_v51osd,False,True,t3_v51osd,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v51osd/only_53_of_kadyrovs_troops_in_ukraine_are_ethnic/ib77ds8/,1654388345,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654359529.0,

&gt; Over the course of 4 June, Russian occupation forces launched Tochka-U missiles on Kramatorsk, Bakhmut, Lysychansk, and Kostiantynivka.

&gt; The General Staff has said that Russian propaganda continues to spread false information that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are allegedly opening fire on schools, hospitals, and churches in order to frame the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine on Russian troops.

&gt; On the morning of 4 June, the General Staff reported that Russian occupation forces had suffered losses on the Sloviansk front and were forced to retreat.
