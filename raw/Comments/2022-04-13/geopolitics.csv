I don't know too much about African geopolitics, all I know that may have affected this Is basically know that many nations  get a lot of western aid, which has helped alleviate poverty. That China is investing heavily and there is resentment against colonialism, so I can see why many had no problem condemning.

&gt;&gt;Also, the recent UN vote to eject Russia from the human rights council was much more closely divided if you count abstentions, it was like 90 vs. 80

I think the abstentions were not a support of Russia. Ukraine and Russia  are 6 weeks into a war, there has been no 'proof' of war crimes etc bought before any sort of international court yet. So it could just be nations not wanting the west to ram through something that suits them. Kicking Russia off a UN body could reduce the chance of peace talks as well. Disagreeing with that doesn't mean they don't condemn the invasion.

I think it will take a large hit.

Soft power is not just cultural. This will complete the impetus for Europe's drive away from fossil fuels. I have always suspected Europe was fast to act on climate change due to Russian fossil fuels. This process will now be accelerated. Reducing Russias leverage over many nations and reducing their income.

Russian media has already been booted out of many nations, as well as embassy staff etc.

Cultural exchanges will be shut down, there will be less tourists etc who go to russia and enjoy their time there and bring money into the country.

This is probably a huge wrench in china's plans as well. Although China can pivot. China has probably lost a large respect for Russia and has accelerated Russias path to being a Chinese vassal state. A unified west, with an incensed Japan must have irritated China. Plus so far it is a dry run for America to test out methods of defending taiwan short of war. I can't imagine China is anything but pissed at Russia. 

&gt;&gt;From what I've gathered, outside the west and its partners, Russia's invasion is viewed as no worse than the Iraq war hell if anything slightly better since the argument for NATO encroachment. 

Here I disagree as well. Most nations condemned the invasion, but are in no place to actually do anything other than offer verbal support. Everyone knows why India and China (the only two relevant nations who havnt condemned) haven't condemned. 

Later, as food prices really start to impact poorer nations, and the war affects those nations livelihoods, where will anger be directed? Russia will need to do some serious propoganda work so that its not directed at them. 

Russia as they have already begun to, will need to pivot away from the west. However geographically they are limited to China, no matter how many far flung friendly nations they have.

There are some things the EU &amp; US both mostly agree on for sure, and the news will emphasise what is 'shared' to some extent, but even then it's not that simple.

Europe still has a large amount of diversity in culture, and different regions are invested at different levels in the EU project, especially in terms of some of the ideologies certain members want to enforce on the others.

[],False,,rdj12345667910,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ox0jts9,False,False,"I am definitely not saying that every diplomatic compromise is 1938 Munich, but I think there is an important distinction between a diplomatic concession and appeasement. Israel handed back the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1979 - this wasn't appeasement because in exchange Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt and improved their own security situation. Giving up concessions without getting any concrete concessions or security guarantees in return is appeasement. 

I don't think many people actually believe that a Communist Soviet Union 2.0 is going to emerge from the ashes. I think the argument is that Russia will seek to control former Soviet Republics and will, through either outright annexation or puppeting, reemerge as a ""Greater Russia"" which controls much of the same resources and territory as the Soviet Union. As far as the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe - the former Warsaw Pact countries and the Baltics jumped at the chance to join NATO. This isn't a situation where these countries desired closer relations with Russia and the West dragged them kicking and screaming into joining NATO. Similarly, why do you assume that Russia dominating Eastern Europe wouldn't also lead to another Cold War in which Russia is in a much stronger position then it is now? To me, Ukraine is a textbook example of how a Russian sphere of influence would work in Eastern Europe. Everything would be nice and peaceful until a pro-Russian government is replaced with a government who desires closer relationships with the West. Then the veneer would be stripped off. 

As far as Taiwan, I think a peaceful reunification is unlikely at this point. Again, I don't think the majority of Taiwan is too enthusiastic about joining mainland China. As far as the US, I agree a war would cause a large loss of life for all parties involved - but I think it would be unavoidable if China decides to try to seize Taiwan. China is the biggest geopolitical rival to the United States and Taiwan is a critical piece in US's strategy of containment. Not only would the fall of Taiwan severely damage US credibility to its allies, Taiwan would be an excellent strategic position for China to use to challenge the US in the Pacific. 

I am not saying that every diplomatic compromise is appeasement, and I'm certainly not saying that diplomacy is worthless. What I am saying is that there is a reality of realpolitik that Superpowers and Great Powers generally do not give concessions to rivals in exchange for nothing but the ""hope"" of peace. And honestly - why would they, especially if the granting of these concessions strengthens their rivals for nothing concrete in return? As far as Versailles, in my mind the issue was that it was strong enough to make the Germans feel slighted, but not strong enough to prevent their rearmament. In combination, the British and French governments were too economically and politically weak to enforce the terms of Versailles, and then halt German expansionism and aggressiveness by militarily intervening. If Germany truly thought they'd be starting a war with France and Britain when they reoccupied the Rhineland, annexed Austria, and annexed Chechoslovakia - Hitler's calculus would've probably changed and Germany may have made different decisions. And yes, Britain and France were unprepared in 1938, but so was Germany. 

As far as Russia in the 1990s, I think the strategy for the US and the West was cautiousness. Certainly the US and NATO would have preferred warmer relations with Russia and you are correct that Russia was temporarily weakened and not nearly as powerful as the former Soviet Union. That said, there were valid concerns that a resurgent Russia could dominate its neighbors in the future. Obviously former Warsaw Pact countries were concerned about this occurring and were eager to join NATO. With respect to security for Eastern Europe and the Baltics - partnerships and warmer relations with Russia are important but they are not as secure as a defensive military alliance. I am not discounting diplomacy and trying to foster good international relationships, but from a security perspective those are not concrete and can change with time. Can we really say with confidence that if NATO hadn't expanded in the 90s, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania wouldn't be experiencing the same situation we're witnessing in Ukraine right now? Furthermore, why are non-NATO countries close to Russia such as Finland and Sweden scrambling to join Nato? If they are not a part of NATO currently (and thus not a security threat to Russia), why do they feel the urgent need to join NATO?",ff01f9eb316f797db2e627b4cf41cc8b2056b5e8,True,False,,,,,0,1649885304,,0,{},i4mara3,False,t3_u22n76,False,False,t1_i4kznol,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4mara3/,1649885323,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649856504.0

[],False,,Luxtenebris3,,,[],,,,text,t2_9pe1c,False,False,"The US maintains this commitment to Europe for 2 reasons. The first is ideology. The US really does believe in the idea of a liberal international order. It's commitment to this is imperfect to be sure, but it doesn't change that this belief does drive policy in many instances.

Democracies and authoritarian regimes broadly speaking seek to undermine the other camp. Both seek regime change of the other because the other seeks regime change of them, and the more international states in your camp the safer your regimes position. This isn't an absolute of course. The US is allied to states like Saudi Arabia. But it should be recognized that tactical concessions do get made to achieve greater strategic goals.

The US maintaining involvement in Europe helps to (imperfectly) guard against democratic backsliding.

The second is geopolics. Functionally the US is an island offshore from the mainland (Afro-Eurasia.) It has no security threats at home, so the next step is to ensure no one comes to dominate the mainland. From such a position a challenge to the US could be made.

Europe is full of small weak countries and a few mid sized powers. It's terrain is ideal for armies to sweep through and conquer whole regions from pitched battles. Historical precedent is that conquest is possible and that insurgencies can be defeated. That's not to say it is necessarily easy. But a powerful Russia could easily swallow eastern Europe and use those resources to dominate much of the remainder. Using that empire and aligned states it could expand further in Eurasia or build major fleets. 

It is pragmatic to make certain no new Russian empire ever comes to exist and that Russia is kept a regional power in perpetuity.

It should be noted that any conflict vs China would likely be a naval + air war and not a ground war. The limits of what the US can actually field in the western Pacific leaves plenty to secure Europe as well, especially given the rest of Europe has military assets as well.",0e0af46f8bfe2421d86828a475292a2f8463cad9,True,False,,,,,0,1649872388,,0,{},i4le26l,False,t3_u2q898,False,True,t3_u2q898,/r/geopolitics/comments/u2q898/im_looking_for_an_indepth_discussion_of_the/i4le26l/,1649872402,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649843588.0

Other than what already been said and related to this, it is in the interest of the USA to maintain control of the Pacific and Atlantic. Not only to project power but also to defend itself. USA can only be attacked by sea power. Only the UK and Japan have ever attempted a proper attack.

So keeping them friendly is an easy way of avoiding war. It also means they act as buffer states. Maintaining a forward position in Japan and UK is easier than shipping from bases 3000 miles away. For example, China now is seen as a threat, Japan is the forward base there.

Where as UK is the forward base to stand off against a hostile United Europe. Which right now might not be an issue, but in the future could be.

Ofcourse both Japan and UK benifit from the defence agreements.

Further into Europe, the more states on the Atlantic coast that are friendly and act as buffer states is good for the US.

(b) is kind of conditional on (a) because the IMF thinks the current debt burden is fundamentally unsustainable. But on (b), Sri Lanka is due to start meeting with the IMF in the next few days.

Its hard to know exactly how effective modern Chinese equipment is as we haven't seen them in actual use and they don't seem to export the more advanced stuff.

Invading Taiwan would be a lot more difficult due to it being an island, and a pretty small one at that. The most plausible landing beaches have been fortified for decades now. The island is also densily populated and as we've seen in recent wars urban areas are basically fortresses that take weeks or months to reduce when defended by a determined force.

A disadvantage for Taiwan being an island is that they will be blockaded by China making it a lot more difficult to receive foreign help.

[],False,,MauritanianHistory,,,[],,,,text,t2_3g8sklbz,False,False,"You can't argue that every single political juncture between great powers an example of Munich 1938 or pretend that the post-war and post-Cold War era hasn't left a status quo which is detrimental to security in many ways. These bizarre fears of a renewed Soviet Union makes no sense - the USSR fell from the inside because it was unviable and Russians didn't want it, and it doesn't comport with Russian national identity or ideology post-Cold War. Russian domination of the Baltics and its immediate former Soviet States is not a threat to global security in the way that a renewed Cold War with Russia is, and the West can always counterbalance that influence with carrots and sticks that aren't full-blown military alliance, as it did successfully in Ukraine for decades. 

In fact, diplomatic and economic ties between those post Soviet nations and the West have been welcomed by Russia even as they participated in the NATO's MAP. Putin found that to be a tolerable and sometimes even advantageous status quo, and did not really try to upset it until after 2008, when it became clear that the West were pushing to end it by making all those states NATO members. It's remarkable how before 2014, Putin was a guy who was viewed as willing to compete peacefully with the West in his own backyard, even if he was bitter about NATO expansion, and after that he is supposedly on the march and unwillingly to accept anything less than revival of the USSR.

&gt; If China ""reunites"" with Taiwan, what prevents China from directly challenging the US in the Pacific? Why should the US and the West ""grant"" these concessions to their foremost geopolitical rivals for nothing in return except a hope of preserving peace.

The alternative is for the United States and China, two nuclear powers, to go to war over Taiwan, a prospect that nobody really likes to think about except military planners who agree it could be a global disaster regardless of the outcome and the prospect for nuclear weapons use is unknown because we have almost no real experience with the mechanisms of nuclear escalation in a hot war. And losing Taiwan is not synonymous with losing the Pacific for the USA.

&gt;I mean, some variation of ""peace in our time"" was why the UK and France didn't respond more forcefully to multiple aggressions a few years earlier.

This is - if you really think about it - a facetious argument. If you take the particular moment of the Munich Agreement and try to universalize it into a view where any compromise between great powers is ""appeasement"" and will necessarily lead to expansionism and war between those powers, you are not only missing the big picture, but advocating for a world where diplomacy is pointless and war in inevitable anyways. After all, who is going to give anything up if they think its always to their detriment?

You forget something important about Munich 1938 - The Treaty of Versailles, ""neither just nor wise"" was the instigating cause behind Germany's explosive revisionism. Humiliating conditions, encirclement and diclinism imposed by foreign powers are what radicalized important segments of German society and transformed it into a military state *par excellence*. Historians are more and more voicing the idea that WWI and WWII should be considered more like a single conflict with a long ceasefire in the middle. 

This is actually not dissimilar to what happened to Russia when the USSR fell and the United States, Gorbachev and Yeltsin negotiated an end to the Cold War that planted the seeds of the current conflict (consider Ukraine's bizarre borders for example). The only way to rectify that is to create clear and inviolable spheres of influence based on geopolitical and demographic considerations. Instead of crafting an Eastern Europe - with Russian help - that would accommodate both East and West, what instead occurred was a sham compromise (make no mistake of it) where unsteady and paralyzed Russia agree to what amounted to an encroaching Western monopoly on all of Europe, and the final straw was the Maidan coup d'état, which truly did disenfranchise Russian peoples in Ukraine right across the border from Russia. This was an extremely unadvisable policy, as even in 2013 it appeared that Russia was coming to live with the first tranches of NATO expansion and perhaps even creating a mutually beneficial status quo with NATO in the Baltics.

By the way, there are plenty of great arguments about appeasement's causes - not naivete or some kind of misplaced peacenik attitude, but the fact that both Britain and France were unprepared to face Germany at the 1939 juncture and after, and only the partition of Poland forced their hand into what would be a losing war had the United States not interfered.

China can send fighters and missiles galore to bomb all the infrastructure into submission, the whole island is flying distance. Taiwan has little to replace the losses being blockaded so a war of attrition would go to China by default.

The US would have trans-pacific supply lines, that would take years to ramp up to WW2 levels.
Supply would require massive convoys. These could be hidden in WW2, these days not a single surface ship would get through. Detection range is global, bomber range a few thousand miles.

It's also not fighting Japan that had far less technology and an entirely resource starved home base. Historically US is big on promises but not really a reliable ally in the face of costly decisions. 

China can impose massive cost on the US. No Chinese exports would totally cripple the US economy. Imagine having to recover anything from household appliances, office supplies, electronics, production machinery, heating systems, HVAC, car parts, farm implements.
In turn all the US could do would be long distance bombing (carrier strikes would last a week or two max) or nukes. Nukes would carry retaliation, hard sell to trade SF, LA and New York  for Beijing and Shanghai. This would also end the dollar as a reserve currency and intercontinental oil trade.

For the same reasons I can't see the West try the same sanctions now applied to Russia. Later this year when the sanctions result in lower GDP, unemployment, higher inflation and tax rates, the support for sanctions will crater.

China has fuel, soldiers, guns, artillery in plenty, no need for super high tech weapons.
Urban fights can be avoided if you use the Russian method and mostly flatten cities. Cities are only valuable for their density and infrastructure. If you can rebuild those after the war, you starve cities but don't occupy. You can even try decapitation strikes on city level.
They would have weeks to establish a foothold if they can't take one by surprise. China can turn the LZ into a killing zone as well, the conflict could look a lot like WW1 or the siege of Sevastopol.

2) Ukraine is technically the largest country by landmass in Europe if you ignore Russia. Spreading out exacerbates supply line/connectivity issues. During the early stages Russia did well, it was only once they started spreading out trying to take the whole country that they started to falter.

Taiwan is much smaller, hence it's a totally different situation. There are downsides to the sea, but there are upsides too - that is to say, you won't have many road blocks. At least you won't have to worry about getting stuck in the mud like what happened in the Ukraine, hence you don't have to worry about this as much in calculations and can expect to get from A to B within expected time ranges. 

3) The Taiwan conflict will be determined by technological edge, rather than infantry competence.

Missiles &gt; Navy &gt; Airforce &gt; Army. The distance from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan is not that far. Close enough for missiles to reach, barrage and overload given current technology, this will become easier and cheaper in future generations. Utilizing missiles you don't have to risk as much, if you don't want to during the initial phases.

The main trigger of a Chinese invasion any time soon, probably is if Taiwan openly and clearly pushes for independence (instead of the current status quo of eventual 'peaceful' reunification through diplomacy). From the CCP view, they will have a lot more casus belli in this scenario, hence can be more brutal than if China invades first. Then it'll be a game of chicken to see if the Taiwan people actually want war (just look at all the destruction occurring in Ukraine. The Taiwanese are wealthy and have a lot more to lose, are they so willing to fight? - vs at least, stopping with the push for independence and returning to the stable status quo).

The article describes the former event that led to US invasion of Afganistan and the actual seizing by Joe Biden of $7 billion in assets held by the Afghan Central Bank in US financial institutions which will certainly have dire consequences on a' already beyond damaged country and popular. 

Quote from the article : ""The subsequent war and twenty-year occupation of Afghanistan have had a devastating impact on the people, who never really recovered from the ten-year Soviet Occupation of 1979-1989 or the civil war which followed. Five decades of famine, war and occupation have broken the country, but just when the Afghan people thought that matters couldn't get worse, they did.

February, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order which froze $7 billion in assets held by the Afghan Central Bank in US financial institutions. On top of that, he seized $3.5bn which he said would be used for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan and, bizarrely, for the families of the 9/11 victims. ""This executive order is designed to provide a path for the funds to reach the people of Afghanistan while keeping them out of the hands of the Taliban and malicious actors,"" said the White House. Really?

I am in Afghanistan as I write, and I can tell you that Biden's executive order is proving more deadly than the trillions of dollars spent by three previous US presidents in their war against the Taliban. I have seen with my own eyes the poverty and deprivation in Logar and Nangarhar in eastern Afghanistan, two of the most bombed provinces in the country.

Later this week I will be travelling to other remote, rural areas where the hardship being endured at the hands of US sanctions borders on the criminal. The US has plenty to say about Russian atrocities being committed in the war in Ukraine — and I'm not disputing that — but Biden's sanctions on Afghanistan are also having a deadly impact on millions of innocents.""

China and Russia were simply integrated into the global system at a time where they could take advantage of it the best. China succeeded because it has tighter regulations. Russia failed bc it was privatized and looted in the 90s, thus creating an oligarchy (and the logical conclusion of where the US is headed).",476e5feca2f0a7920882a0354b4f3f412438ec50,True,False,,,,,0,1649837889,,0,{},i4jhai3,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t3_u22n76,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4jhai3/,1649837906,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649809089.0

[],False,,EqualContact,,,[],,,,text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,"Many people have addressed the matter of invading Taiwan itself, but let's muse on the PLA itself for a little while.

China has not fought a large-scale conflict since the Sino-Vietnamese War, which arguably they lost, and that was in 1979, and involved likely a fraction of the troops that a successful invasion would require. The Korean War is similar to the scale of operation needed, but that was so long ago now that it may as well have been fought in the 1650s.

Countries that do not practice military operations somewhat often tend not to have very good execution when conflict actually starts. Russia in Ukraine is I think a good example of that. It was Russia's largest operation since Afghanistan, and they seemed very ill-prepared for the amount of communication and coordination needed to manage so many troops. This is not a new problem (see the Battle of Tannenberg), but I think it goes to how much practice command structures need in order to effectively control massive amounts of manpower.

The complexity has further increased in the age of combined arms. One of the criticisms of Russia's military is that its control structure is far too centralized, meaning that individual units are rarely allowed to take initiative, and it is nearly impossible to communicate with other units outside of the chain of command. 

Authoritarian states tend to rely on strict command structures because they do not want to allow for the possibility of the military turning against the state. This is why the USSR structured the military the way that it did, and Russia has changed little about it. We can't know for sure (because again we haven't seen it in action), but it is likely that China suffers from this same flaw. 

The only real counterexample I can think of is World War-era Germany. In WWI, the Prussian military tradition meant that state and army were not clearly delineated from each other. Then in WWII, the military was a major political force that the Nazis needed to ally with to accomplish their goals, so subjugating the Wehrmacht never happened—though I wouldn't have been surprised if a victorious Germany hadn't proceeded to execute all of its generals.

I would guess that China is technocratic enough that leadership is generally aware of these problems.

What China does have going for it is being a much more organized state than Russia at current with immensely more manpower available. Nevertheless, I would anticipate that an invasion of Taiwan would be a massive failure if the PLA didn't take many steps to assure victory. This includes gaining experience in combat situations and allowing for effective self-critique of its effectiveness. This is of course immensely expensive, but it's how the US military stays sharp—getting involved in an armed conflict every 10–20 years.

If China is serious about an invasion, expect to see military interventions by it in Central Asia or Africa at some point in the coming decade. If this doesn't happen, I would guess that China has decided invasion is either impossible or would require complete destruction of the island before landing troops.",86722582399dc8b6307ce053a024bb293d5df3f8,True,False,,,,,0,1649834791,,0,{},i4jdnqh,False,t3_u23uah,False,True,t3_u23uah,/r/geopolitics/comments/u23uah/would_china_and_the_pla_be_any_more_competent/i4jdnqh/,1649834803,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649805991.0

Actually its just a crudely put version of a serious argument in diplomatic history right now. It's an argument made in the pages of most basic introduction to IR books, and foundational analysts of the international system like Jervis, Waltz and Mearsheimer.

&gt;How? How were their role subservient?

For the systematic bias of the WTO against non-developed economies (including Russia's and China's economies in the 2000s) see Michael Khor's work.

&gt;Why should Russia be ""granted"" anything?

Great powers should be ""granted"" things in the case that it serves the general peace and expediency of the world. Not ""granting"" states that have serious global influence some security or trade concessions in areas you don't consider vital to your interests, but are vital to their interests, sets the stage for a dangerous deterioration in international security. 

&gt;They are an economical and military smidge compared to China and USA.

So is the UK, so is France. They still have a seat at the table. In fact, they are more capable and more dangerous than either the UK or France. Just ten years after Stalin died, while still under a backwards communist system, they were capable of bridging the military and technological gap with the West and creating all sorts of global problems. It does not matter if Russia's economy is about the size of Italy's. It still has significant global power, and is the regional hegemon in Central Asia. 

&gt;Also who grants that mythical ""seat at the table""?

I hope you meant to say the metaphorical seat... you can't seriously imagine that there is no such thing in international politics. The UNSC members weren't picked by lottery. They were picked based on the foundationally important fact that you cannot run international protocols and institutions to manage conflict between great powers without including said great powers. To maintain global peace between great powers and to resolve security disputes without reigniting potentially species-ending confrontations between them, there must be willingness to sacrifice marginal interests and principled mumbo jumbo stances and practice serious and strategically-motivated diplomacy. 

&gt;What were China and Russia not granted?

China was not granted reunification of its territory, e.g. Taiwan, which by U.N decree is not an independent state, and which cannot and will likely never declare independence out of fear of losing its de facto independence through war. Taiwan is a small state and has no place at the table. Russia was not granted appropriate respect to its security and trade spheres following the collapse of the USSR, especially the demand to maintain a buffer zone between itself and the West.

Of course none of these are ""entitlements"" in the normative sense. They are simply the various security needs and demands that nuclear powered nations have repeatedly and seriously attempted to resolve through diplomacy, mutual agreements and some diplomatic respect for a stable modus vivendi.",4c1ea4dcf90cad71c2147240179e9a112711ce24,True,False,,,,,0,1649833107,,0,{},i4jbljn,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i4j24rw,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i4jbljn/,1649833119,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649804307.0

[],False,,Alembici,,,[],,,,text,t2_bayisjqh,False,False,"This question predicates more on whether Taiwan can shift its military doctrine moreso than any of China's capabilities. 

As of current, the Taiwanese military emphasizes a ""drive them off the beaches"" approach to combating a PLA invasion. Obvious problem herein lies with the overwhelming air, naval and firepower superiority enjoyed by the PLANMC in any opening landing. It won't be light infantry assaulting the beaches; it'll be mechanized ZBD-05s and airborne elements which require more standoff anti-armor and anti-air weapons which Taiwan is not procuring in big enough numbers. In particular, infantry-laden weapons are key because of their high mobility and assumed PLA interdiction and destruction of any artillery or missile units which open fire or turn on their radars. There will not be a chance where the Taiwanese military can remotely compete with the PLA in any domain owing to both a numerical disparity and an increasing technological disparity, leading to a necessary overhaul of Taiwan's defensive doctrine. 

Currently, there's an idea known as the Overall Defense Concept which would revolutionize Taiwanese defense doctrine. It calls for a more protracted war, though not one of active civilian resistance. The main emphasis is on the procurement of asymmetrical warfare items such as MANPADs to mitigate PLAA attack helicopters roaming and destroying Taiwanese units. However, purchases of big-ticket items like the F-16 are still necessary to bolster political support both in Washington and at home of the defense of Taiwan, and committing the United States to strategic ambiguity which has shielded the island for so long. Han Kuang military exercises are a waste of resources, but it provides the public with a palpable solution to a Chinese invasion, even if such an exercise is extremely outdated and inapplicable to any Chinese invasion. 

Neither side has any experience in large-scale operations, but few countries do, less so or none in respect to modern amphibious operations. All one could say is that Chinese missiles and PGMs will knock out most Taiwanese C2 units in the immediacy of the war, so everything falls on a decentralized framework of asymmetrical warfare bordering on active civilian resistance.",8f2afb877ed7139d13a002f51cbddd137ddc106f,True,False,,,,,0,1649827566,,0,{},i4j419h,False,t3_u23uah,False,True,t3_u23uah,/r/geopolitics/comments/u23uah/would_china_and_the_pla_be_any_more_competent/i4j419h/,1649827577,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649798766.0

I would encourage you to take a step back and not come to any bold conclusions quite yet. While it is true that the Russian leadership and its military have made a lot of mistakes, the fog of war has not dissipated yet and we don't actually know what is truly going on. The situation there is still very precarious and the upcoming fight in Donbass could reverse the fortunes of war.

Here in the West we only get footage of all the small ambushes and skirmishes that overwhelmingly show Ukrainian victories, what we are not exposed to at all is the stuff that the Russians do well. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pVEP0AzZ4&amp;ab_channel=TheChieftain) does a good job explaining it.

So it is important that when we analyze the current war in Ukraine, we don't let the war propaganda skew our perception of our adversaries and to develop a sense of superiority and arrogance because we are not exposed to the full spectrum of information. Likewise when analyzing China's potential, we don't want to fall into the trap of thinking that just because the Russians are struggling, that Taiwan is going to go along the same lines.

Taiwan doesn't have a land border with a NATO country, while China does have a very concentrated Navy in the region that could contest resupply of the island. At the same time the Chinese military is inexperienced and conquering an island presents its own very unique challenges.

TLDR: don't be too quick to write off the war in Ukraine quite yet and don't use the same lens to analyze the Taiwan situation.",af1251fc05a1eead901cae749f7a623a4f3837c7,True,False,,,,,0,1649823593,,0,{},i4ixe7r,False,t3_u23uah,False,True,t3_u23uah,/r/geopolitics/comments/u23uah/would_china_and_the_pla_be_any_more_competent/i4ixe7r/,1649823610,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649794793.0
