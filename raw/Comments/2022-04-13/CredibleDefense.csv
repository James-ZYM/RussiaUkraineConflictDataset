This is simply not true - or rather, it's probably only half true. This is about Ukraine *and* NATO. If Russia was hell-bent on destroying Ukraine, they would have done so in 2015 when the Ukrainian military was close to collapse, not 7 years after the fact. The goal is not a destruction of Ukraine, it's that they wish Ukraine to be firmly within the Russian orbit and sphere of influence - almost a permanent vassal. Obviously Ukraine does not want this. 

I agree with you that Russia / Ukraine have always had fundamental security issues that shape their relations. This has been true since the end of the cold war (hence why George Kennan and so many others opposed NATO expansion and warned about the dangers of the Ukraine / Russia situation). The issue with NATO expansion is that Article 5 renders these concerns sum-zero and binary in outcome - it raises the stakes of Ukrainian / Russian conflict to WW3, and thus a defensive alliance can have a destabilizing impact. 

Complex affairs are almost never monocausal and this war is no different. Russia wants a say in Ukraine's foreign policy and aspects of Ukraine's internal governance. Russia also wants to block further NATO expansion and roll back Ukrainian cooperation with NATO who, since 2016, was increasingly being treated as a de facto NATO member. Russia always links concerns about Ukraine to broader concerns about European security. A player with the significance of Russia does not view itself as a fundamental stakeholder in European security, and there is little evidence that without the United States, Europe can lead their own way out of a major crisis.",13f0fb86c10af4570a88e6ea47063c66bec09e3f,True,False,,,,,0,1649886374,,0,{},i4mdez3,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4mbd4a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4mdez3/,1649886385,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649857574.0

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,False,"The issue I have with that, it's true that the analysis has often been wrong, but it's really only been wrong in one direction. Just on a schematic level, that suggests a systemic error in the analysis but not a problem with the analysis itself.

There have been few, if any, credible people who have erred by underestimating Russian capabilities. ISW was one of the first groups to identify the Russian invasion as faltering and took a lot of heat for it before being proved correct.

There seems to be an underlying assumption in the general media that (1) Russia is preparing the all-out assault you mention, and that (2) the assault will obviously have at least some success when carried out.

In my view, there are four identifiable issues here with an all out assault:

- The first is that the West is starting to  provide heavy weapons to Ukraine, and Ukraine is digging in. We all know exactly where Russia will attack from, and the UA has access to US intelligence which had clearly penetrated Russian comms at a high level. All of this suggests that Russia must attack as soon as possible because the UA position improves by the day.

- The second is that the spring mud is still here, and will likely be here through the end of the month. Russian vehicles are, once again, confined to roads while UA light infantry with ATGM can ambush at will. This prevents Russia from attacking immediately. 

- The third is that Ukraine is finally getting heavy equipment from the West. Although they are unlikely to match Russia's firepower, every day Russia delays lessens their firepower advantage, which is the only advantage they have.

- The fourth is the logistical problems that Russia continues to have. The 40-mile convoy situation in the spring resulted from a bunch of smaller convoys stacking up at a choke point. I think the new 8-mile convoy outside Izyum is evidence that these supply issued remain unresolved. Russia needs to delay further to ensure any new offensive can continue for more than a few days.

So that's where we are: Russia's best chance is to attack immediately, and nearly every factor would appear to force the delay for major operations until at least late April. One question is whether Russia has the capability to actually launch a large scale attack, which Inam skeptical of. But I think the larger question is whether Russia can launch any attack that isn't suicidal in terms of attrition, and I think the emerging answer on that is probably not under foreseeable circumstances.",565a1b48f9363d5cfef1ebb6c9521d35ab3e1039,True,False,,,,,0,1649885885,,0,{},i4mc73n,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4m33re,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4mc73n/,1649885900,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649857085.0

I don't disagree, what I find concerning; however, is a reluctance to admit that Russia has the ability to impose costs on Western powers.

Is this true? I find this take very common amongst people who don't remember a Russia before 2008, as if Russia is somehow deterministically anti-western no matter what and decidedly imperialist for no other reason than they're Russian. A brief overview of post-soviet history from the 90s onwards shows this isn't the case. Indeed, the failure to secure a post-cold war settlement is partially to blame for where we are today.

If anyone is serious about providing sophisticated capabilities, train them like US trained Chinese expeditionary force in Burma. Ship out tens of thousands of best Ukraine has to offer in complete units and take them somewhere to do a total makeover for a year and or 2 top to bottom, then send them back along with all the shiny toys. Maybe after that help them build western infrastructures and keep a few hundred advisor embedded.

And if they really want to operate fighters effectively they need to significantly up their game in air and missile defense for fixed sites, figure out agile deployment and rapid damage recovery. They need an entire suite of even most sophisticated capabilities to deal with Russian air defense to operate along Russian and separatist region border. And since present day warfare favors offense they fundamentally need to deal with long range missiles left of launch, which means Scud hunt, sinking quite a few major surface warships and if that's not crazy enough going into Russian airspace shoot down a few bears or fire JASSM-ER on their airfield. And they need a very significant mass to come close to match Russia. Basically they need to be a slightly smaller US...

In terms of aircraft types of choice, avoiding a bizarre mixed fleet causing a logistical nightmare is IMHO important, so they need types with significant fleet size but cover all the bases in term of capability.

[],False,,darawk,,,[],,,,text,t2_3sked,False,False,"&gt; A key part of being in a terrorist organization is evading capture and surivleance , by killing off terrorist you select for those with the best OPSEC. One of the reasons the allies didn't try and kill Hitler was that they were scared someone more competent would be put in his place.

This is true, but that makes it a choice between ""all the guys with good opsec *and* the guys with bad opsec"", or ""just the guys with good opsec"". In order for the former to be preferable, you'd have to posit some substantial benefit to ""opsec density"" in the command structure. In principle this is possible, but it doesn't strike me as likely to be outweighed by the loss of personnel with other capabilities. 

&gt; Those organizations are not comparable to AQ. AQ is not meant to make profits, or to be a standing army. It's made to cause enough destruction through terrorism that the US would be forced to engage in very costly military actions in order to defeat it. They bet that they could grind down the US enough to the point that the American people would grow weary of intervention in the middle east and get their politicians to pull out. Once this happened, AQ then wanted to take care of the near enemy and overthrow the house of saud and other gulf rulers that they saw as puppets.

Those things are definitely true. And a decentralized organization can definitely be effective, I think the argument is just that it will be materially less effective than if it were allowed to be centralized.

I think a possible counter-argument to this is that, while perhaps AQ could be more effective strategically if it could centralize itself, that would also make it much easier to monitor. So we'd be somewhat choosing between degrading strategic efficacy and losing insight into their plans and structure. I lean towards degrading their strategic efficacy being more important, but reasonable people could differ on that.",746f9cfa84483bfad30f62b2ac0d8d9716a4e1ec,True,False,,,,,0,1649881173,,0,{},i4m07e8,False,t3_u2rs88,False,True,t1_i4ltb49,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2rs88/were_drone_strikes_effective_evaluating_the_drone/i4m07e8/,1649881184,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649852373.0

I've sincerely had doubts for a few days that Russia was actually ever going to launch a WW2/Kursk style offensive, but this is the fist time I've seen the suggestion that it won't happen from a good source.

This does not, in my estimation, bode well for Russia? If they are just feeding in reinforcements instead of concentrating forces, this really might just turn into a replay of the northern front.

You spam that 8th grade linear model, which isn’t even useful, as some sort of prediction of Russian collapse from *equipment* loss. Even if you were going to use such a hamfisted method, you’re mapping what’s clearly a logistic growth function to a linear model and pretending that’s useful insight. 

That’s not to mention that half of the tanks lost were abandoned, not destroyed or captured. Likely due to logistical issues in the north which no longer exist. That’s not to mention that the usefulness of javelin teams is drastically reduced in the terrain of Donbas. 

Your model isn’t useful, it lacks context, and anyone who tells you they know how a battle is going to unfold is either promoting a narrative or has an agenda. There’s a reason every credible analyst is hedging their bets and says they don’t know how the battle in the Donbas will unfold, because they don’t know. 

It’s honestly shocking that we’re on a sub about credible defense policy and people are here touting arguments that wouldn’t stand in an undergraduate strategic studies class that had stuff by Biddle in the syllabus. Russias failures here are a matter of force employment (and now manpower to a lesser extent). Your flawed observations observe a side effect of Russia’s poor employment of their forces. Talking about materiel losses in the sense that you are isn’t useful. If Russia continues to employ its forces poorly it will lose, if they correct their failures in force employment then they might not lose.

If you go to any factory in the world and kill all the workers, even if the company can hire new ones, productivity is going to drop for quite a while, even if the processes they're executing are relatively simple.

A key part of being in a terrorist organization is evading capture and surivleance , by killing off terrorist you select for those with the best OPSEC. One of the reasons the allies didn't try and kill Hitler was that they were scared someone more competent would be put in his place.

Why shouldn't Apple and Google adopt a decentralized command structure where every engineer just works on what they feel like today?

Those organizations are not comparable to AQ. AQ is not meant to make profits, or to be a standing army. It's made to cause enough destruction through terrorism that the US would be forced to engage in very costly military actions in order to defeat it. They bet that they could grind down the US enough to the point that the American people would grow weary of intervention in the middle east and get their politicians to pull out.

What a wonderful way to characterize the comment you're responding to: ""Russian supporter."" Almost reminds me of the kind of rhetoric floating around inside Russian society right now: you either support the war, whatever that means, or you're a traitor.

It's not ""supporting Russia"" to urge caution here. It's realism. NATO and the US cannot endlessly escalate against Russia until it submits as we've grown accustomed to in other conflicts. Everyone who isn't insane understands that.

Where the line is, that's the matter of debate. Clearly things like, say, a NATO invasion of Russia to topple its regime and replace it with one of our choosing is off the table, but there are people (lots of people it seems) who want to convince us that direct NATO attacks on Russian forces *operating in Ukraine* won't for some reason cause the conflict to spiral out of control.

Why? They can't say. They just want us to trust them, and they're sneakily ratcheting things in that direction every day. And if we don't think this is a good idea? We're ""Russia supporters"" or ""cowards"" rather than what we actually are: people with a very clear understanding of the risks and a realistic appraisal of the diplomatic and political situation.

A couple of questions about all this.

First, assuming the war goes on past May 9th, what is the likelihood of the West supplying more advanced planes? Are there any jets that Western countries are planning to phase out that would nonetheless be superior to the planes being flown by Russia? Would eg German Tornadoes be of any use?

This is not exactly true. Conflicts are rarely settled by complete battlefield victory or defeat (in fact, these types of resolutions are relatively rare and play an outsized role in our view of conflict thanks to the mythologic status that WW2 has in the Western world). 

The reason conflicts typically end at the negotiation table is that conflict is extraordinarily costly, so much so that often victory looks indistinguishable from defeat. 

The desire to give Putin (or, more accurately, the Moscow policy elite) an off-ramp comes out of a concern that Moscow will escalate as the conflict becomes existential for Putin's regime. Or, on the flipside, if Putin's regime falters and the war is lost, then we could see Russia emerge as a hyper-nationalist revanchist power, disconnected from the global system.

And before you argue that we're going to destroy Russia's capabilities for decades, I'll remind you (ironically with a WW2 reference) that Germany managed to build a frightfully damaging war-making machine from 1918-1939.

Whenever something like this comes out, where we get access to a source of relatively incontrovertible ground-truth about an issue that people have been arguing about for a long time using indirect means, I think it's particularly useful to go back an re-evaluate the epistemic norms that underlay the earlier discussion.

That is, what kinds of arguments were the people who were on the wrong side of this debate making? Why were they wrong? And most importantly, how can we recognize that category of error in the future, and avoid it?

From my reading of this piece, it seems like the meta problem underlying the incorrect views here were strong assumptions of near infinite elasticity in the supply of personnel and capabilities:

&gt; Others have argued that terrorist groups with bureaucratic structures and procedures will have little problem generating deep pools of specialized personnel and talented leaders who can be promoted once a senior leader or middle manager is killed.18 Al-Qaeda’s well-documented standard operating procedures and specialized organizational roles could thus insulate the group from the costs of personnel turnover.

How could this possibly have been true? It certainly wouldn't be true in the US military. It wouldn't be true at any corporation i'm aware of. People who've spent a long time in organizations develop substantial practical knowledge and skills that are not easily transferable in short time frames. If you go to any factory in the world and kill all the workers, even if the company can hire new ones, productivity is going to drop for quite a while, even if the processes they're executing are relatively simple.

Similarly here:

&gt; Others have argued that terrorist groups can adopt organizational procedures and decision-making models that allow them to overcome the tradeoffs between organizational security, efficiency, and control.27 More specifically, terrorist groups can institute decentralized decision-making processes that delegate greater authority further down the chain of command to trusted subordinates, requiring less direct supervision and monitoring from senior leaders for the organization to function.28 Under these conditions, periods of reduced management activity need not derail the speed of a terrorist group’s processes or the responsiveness of its operatives, as well-screened and highly committed subordinates can proceed without senior-level direction.

If this were true, why would people adopt centralized command structures in the first place? Decentralized command structures have their place, but they're strictly worse than centralized ones, *except* in the area of resiliency against attack. If you can force your enemy to be decentralized, you've significantly degraded their ability to pool resources, intelligence, and coordination across their forces. It's true that they can still operate at some level, but small bands of 5-10 guys are far less capable than a coordinated organization of thousands.

I think if I had to try to distill a rule for identifying specious arguments of this form, it would be to ask the question: What else would this argument prove, if true? In this case, the argument is that decentralized command structures are nearly just as good. So, why shouldn't the US military adopt that? Why shouldn't Apple and Google adopt a decentralized command structure where every engineer just works on what they feel like today? In this light, the failure of this perspective is pretty glaring, and it seems to me it could only ever have been seriously believed by treating the enemy as some formless abstraction, somehow entirely differently constituted from us.",bff0021afc12186002bb1dd5c4895588c39f7512,True,False,,,,,0,1649873894,,0,{},i4li0nm,False,t3_u2rs88,False,True,t3_u2rs88,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2rs88/were_drone_strikes_effective_evaluating_the_drone/i4li0nm/,1649873905,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649845094.0

The Taliban was only a single faction that sprung up as that civil war concluded, and it took many more years for them to unify the country until a few warlord holdouts, the Northern Resistance, were all that was left.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;This isn't WW2, there won't be a grand battle; Ukraine can't walk into a fight like that and win without unsustainable losses. They will fight retrograde actions pulling back to urban areas, hills, forests, anywhere that gives them cover, and try to inflict heavy and consistent losses on the Russians. They're trading land for time and casualties, and it might work; has worked so far in other areas. They need to avoid encirclement and maintain enough of a reserve for a genuine counterattack if/when the Russians present a genuine weakness.

I disagree. 

First, there have been grand offensives, Russia just fucked them up because they didn't plan on resistance, and invaded during the mud season, so it was easier to stop them than it should have been (though they still made lots of progress).

Now it appears Russia is on the verge of another massive strategic offensive. Though smaller in focus than the first (as goals should be when the force suffers from limitations), it's still going to be a massive mechanized combined arms attack to grab up a lot of land Ukraine doesn't want to give up. 

Ukraine can't avoid these battles. They can either defend those places like the Donestk oblast, or else they retreat and allow the Russians to take them, which means they require a combined arms mechanized counteroffensive at some later date. Both of those are going to be large scale battles. 

And there just aren't enough urban areas, hills, forests, or other channelizing terrain in the areas of operation in question to rely to do more with less. Right now they still have the mud season going for them now, which still limits Russian cross country ability, but they'll be less mud as the temp warms up and dries it. 

Zelenskyy and the General Staff have an extremely tough decision to make. Do they commit to try to stop the Russian's set piece battle, and suffer the attrition the coming battle will cause? Launch an offensive somewhere else as spoiling attack to cause the Russians to abandon their offensive to shift troops to reinforce areas under attack? Do they pull back beforehand and retreat out of the Donetsk/JFO salient to avoid the battle, and if so do they accept its loss permanently or hope at some much later date they can maybe win it back along with the DPR/LPR and Crimea?",2512b253166bfc1e2a6324c388dba9de2325f5d9,True,False,,,,,0,1649870628,,0,{},i4l9epd,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4l5cov,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4l9epd/,1649870641,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649841828.0

""Time on their side"" is debatable.  Russia has vast reserves of men and materiel, though the ability to get that to the front in a timely and cost effective strategy is questionable.  It remains to be see if political and economic pressures will work.  

It is clear now that most of the big pushes used professional front-line troops, such as the VDV, who took egregious losses.      


&gt; why isn’t Russia turning each and every Ukraine city into Dresden every two days. Is it a matter of limitations or restraints?

They're only near a handful of cities -- they can't bomb everything.  Artillery has a range limit, and Ukrainian AA is good enough to present a threat to aircraft.  

Plus it takes a lot of ordinance to level a city.  Don't waste bombs on cities that you aren't trying to take. 
 

&gt; to me it seems that Russia is not doing well, as from what little images and footage on the aftermath, the station seems to be largely functional compare to one big smoking crater left by a Tallboy of a Grand Slam

Just like with aircraft runways, small defects can prevent transport.  Blast a couple tracks and that takes the station out in the short term, but long term is unlikely; railways aren't especially hard to fix if you've got the crews and resources.  No shortage of rail lines that are busted up, though.  

Big picture it is likely that Russia wants to keep rail lines intact for their use later, since their logistics are dependent on them.  Or that they don't have the resources to focus on strategic-level supply and transport issues; they're trying to win the local fights.

I personally hope and believe the former are in the money, but do we have any concrete and up-to-date evidence to make a judgment

The only people making the “cannon fodder” argument are Russians and their supporters scraping the barrel to justify the military’s performance so far. There’s no reason to believe it’s true and there’s plenty of evidence for the opposite. Airborne and Marine units have already seen heavy use in the conflict, and many of the vehicles being destroyed are Russia’s most modern weapon systems. This is not the makeup of a “cannon fodder” force.

&gt; While the suffering and casualties faced by the citizens are horrendous, and not meant to take the situation lightly, why isn’t Russia turning each and every Ukraine city into Dresden every two days. Is it a matter of limitations or restraints?

The main reason propaganda. Russia isn’t completely ignorant of how it is perceived. It knows it’s already hated in the West, but there are vast numbers of Russians supportive of the war, and a significant ratio of people in non-Western countries sympathetic to Russia. Russia is selling the war to these demographics in two main ways: as a war of liberation against an evil Nazi regime in Kyiv, and a reluctant war of unfortunate necessity to protect Russia. Russia is also leaning into the “Western hypocrisy” fallacy to not necessarily justify the war, but to deflect criticism of it.

These arguments become a lot harder to sell when you start firebombing cities. If Russia flattens Kharkiv in a day with incendiary  munitions and kills tens of thousands of people just as quickly, it becomes a lot harder to argue that Russia is “liberating” Ukraine or just doing what is necessary. They also couldn’t deflect criticism by whining about hypocrisy, since the scale of destruction would be unlike anything seen since at least Vietnam.",ada2744160ecff6b27e857a309351f350ba7d2d5,True,False,,,,,0,1649868771,,0,{},i4l4k4c,False,t3_u2oojz,False,False,t1_i4kpcyy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4l4k4c/,1649868782,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649839971.0

Markings on vehicles, POWs, SIGINT etc have identified Russian units and many of them are top level units. VDV, Guards motor rifle and tanks, etc. The Russian Ground Forces (their army) has \~175 Battalion Tactical Groups in total, and roughly 120-130 have been committed to Ukraine.

&gt;why isn’t Russia turning each and every Ukraine city into Dresden every two days. Is it a matter of limitations or restraints?

To burn down Dresden required a list of conditions. 1)Total air dominance, the city wasn't even defended by flak and the Luftwaffe fighter interceptors at that point barely existed. Ukr still have active air defense 2)Over a thousand heavy bombers were involved in the raid on Dresden. Russia doesn't have that many. 3)Purposeful targeting of civilians to include use of incendiaries that has since both been outlawed by international treaties. If Russia got in trouble over the low body count of Bucha and the Kramatorsk train station, outright terror bombing designed to kill maximum number of people would be a risky decision. 

Meanwhile, the raid damaged/destroyed a lot of housing it didn't destroy the city, force it to surrender, or break the morale of the German people or even the residents of the city (it wasn't taken by the Red Army until the last day of the war). The Dresden raid was designed to impede the Germans at a major transportation hub while the Red Army was launching an offensive to the east of it.

&gt;Regardless of when they commence the attack(if at all), this kind of warfare is what the Russian army designed for and are meant to excel, I would like to listen to your view and prediction of this supposed grand battle.

They'll do their best to use intel to find the Ukr main line of resistance, then they'll find an area they want to attack that affords them the best route to accomplish their operational objective (likely to cut off a Ukraine salient). Because of the more open terrain in that part of Ukraine, its going to be much harder to hide small AT hunter killer teams to conduct effective point ambushes to stop major advances. They'll still have some ability to do that since the Russians wont have full cross country capabilities, but its a far cry from ambushing strung out columns in suburban areas. 

Based on their doctrine, the Russians will likely mass indirect fires on the smallest amount of Ukr frontage they can to maximize damage. Either they'll take their time and spend a couple weeks pulverizing defenses, doing counterbattery, targeting HQs, or they'll try to do it in an hour or so to keep the element of surprise. Also following Russian doctrine, they'll likely only shift/lift the fires as the attack force basically drives into the impact area. Note, the Russian system is designed for this sort of set piece battle, and not for thinking and reacting on the fly and coming up with new plans. So they'll probably do well at this point.

Large numbers of armored units, BTGs based around motor rifle (IFV) and tank battalions with combined arms will either try a roadbound movement or will risk some of the force getting stuck in mud doing cross country. There will likely be a primary attack point against the main effort, with a supporting attack against a supporting effort, to fix Ukr in position and prevent them from responding/shifting forces. How well this works is entirely dependent on their ability to gain intel on the Ukrainians, and the weather. 

If Russians can unfuck their air operations and properly coordinate them, they'll probably try to interdict Ukr forces as they move around behind the front lines, repositioning forces in response to the attack, moving reserves, retreating, etc. Not only will that cause attrition but it'll also cause major delay and loss of morale on the part of the defenders, as nobody likes being attacked by rotary or fixed wing. That's assuming Ukrainian ADA can't deter them, or that the Russians unfuck their significant commo problems (which is going to be a major point in how well this operation goes). 

This coming operation is probably going to rather large scale. At least some of the forces that retreated out of the Kyiv front were immediately committed back into local operational reserve in the Kharkiv area, staging for this upcoming attack; that means they purposely sacrificed the opportunity to reconstitute those units, give them some much needed R&amp;R, time to do maintenance, do some retraining on much needed drills (like react to ATGM). If so, it was either because Russian high command are idiots and don't know any better, or more likely they were desperate to increase their operational order of battle for a major upcoming attack and couldn't/wouldn't spare them. 

Plus, politically, Putin needs a win very badly. Finishing off Mariupol isn't going to be the big win he needs, that is a small tactical victory that doesn't change anything. He needs an operational victory, with a large gain in ground coupled with large Ukr losses so Russian looks stronk and Ukr looks weak. 

Also, the Russians finally unified the Ukr theater command under a single HQ, using the the existing Southern Military District OSK. That commander needs a large scale operation that is all his own so he can show he's competent, that Russians are competent, and that they haven't lost the war. A small localized attack to achieve a small victory wouldn't be ""his"" battle, that would be something one CAA could accomplish. To make a battle ""his"" needs multiple CAA that he has to command and control. Which means at least a two pronged attack, plus a supporting attack (likely in the Sumy area).",eb4729f016f9bde4c137940466ba97dc2bc586fa,True,False,,,,,0,1649867947,,0,{},i4l2cif,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4kpcyy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4l2cif/,1649867964,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649839147.0

-------------

War on the Rocks Podcast, about 27 minutes.

&gt; Michael Kofman joined Ryan once more to update us all on the war in Ukraine. In this episode, Kofman explains how and why Russia is refocusing on the east of Ukraine, what the war in Syria revealed about shortcomings in Russian air force, and what Ukrainian forces need in terms of weaponry and supply to win this war. The two also discuss Russian war crimes and their relation to the Russian military’s internal culture of violence and hazing as well as Vladimir Putin’s framing of this war of “de-nazification.” The conversation ended with Kofman explaining Moscow’s big military manpower decision, which you may have missed, and how it connects to Putin’s difficult strategic position.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"To echo what /u/jrex035 said, most of the equipment that isn't already in Ukrainian hands needs a lot more training and logistics to be effective on the battlefield. 

We talk a lot about military doctrine. The reason for that is most weapons on the battlefield are specialized in the way they are deployed. 

For example, a simple M249 machine gun. You'd think that it is just a machine gun that you point at the enemy and pull the trigger. That would be a wrong assessment. NATO doctrine is to use the machine guns in teams with two machine guns and to use them for superior firepower. So when they encounter an enemy, they immediately deploy two machine guns to pin the enemy, and then work to flank the enemy with another squad. Or call in artillery or air strikes. 

If you don't deploy the M249 in the same way, a heavier, more long range gun would be more effective. The 249 shoots 5.56 which generally has an effective range of around 600-800m. The RPK has a longer effective range of around 1000m. So if the 249 is used as just a squeeze and shoot gun, the RPK would be better. As teams with the RPK would be able to hit teams with the 249 from a further distance. 

The 249 uses 5.56 so they can carry more rounds and then pin the enemy for longer. The RPK uses 7.62x54R, which is about 2X more heavy per cartridge, so carry half as many rounds. So the 249 advantage is specifically related to that doctrine of ""pin the enemy and flank.""

The machine gun is just an example of how training and doctrine goes hand in hand with the weapons in use. There are a lot of weapons that are not effective without the right doctrine and training. Strykers and Bradleys are other great examples.",62d98935e4cb4aa09ab8b986524763fa5ab8801f,True,False,,,,,0,1649865870,,0,{},i4kww1u,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4kqsbp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4kww1u/,1649865885,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649837070.0

&gt;why isn’t Russia turning each and every Ukraine city into Dresden every two days. Is it a matter of limitations or restraints?

Russia doesn't have the ability to do this at all. Mariupol is a special occasion because it's been bombed/fought over for a month and a half already. Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Chernihiv have taken a lot of damage, but not as much as you'd think.

It's bizarre how little of Ukraine's rail infrastructure has been targeted in the war. It's largely operational still across the board, and it's a major part in how Ukraine is moving troops and supplies into the Donbas to prepare for the inevitable Russian attack. The Kramatorsk attack wasn't apparently to damage the station, but to attack what the Russians thought were Ukrainian forces but were really civilians trying to flee (Russian sources celebrated the attack on ""Ukrainian troops"" but quickly deleted their Twitter posts).",f5a1950c36008bbb8a4df69644c5a710d4126cdb,True,False,,,,,0,1649863470,,0,{},i4kqo28,False,t3_u2oojz,False,True,t1_i4kpcyy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u2oojz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_13_2022/i4kqo28/,1649863489,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649834670.0

A delayed attack will also mean for solid ground for heavy equipment and less confined to roads. Regardless of when they commence the attack(if at all), this kind of warfare is what the Russian army designed for and are meant to excel, I would like to listen to your view and prediction of this supposed grand battle.

5. There are plenty of debates regarding Leopard 1 tanks and other western design heavy equipment being sent to Ukraine. I categorized them as follow, and would like to have your opinions.
 a. Whether Ukraine is still in the defensive and fight to prevent sudden-death  stage of the war, thus these deliveries are a distraction to the more important, even vital delivery of the well-established useful defensive weapons (i.e. ATGM and Manpads),as well as other “multipurpose” equipment (i.e. drones of all sizes).
 b. The general suitability of such weapons to the tactical doctrine of Ukraine Army, as they are design and built under a different philosophy.
 c. The required to train crews on these weapons, as they different to what the Ukraine soldiers familiar with, and this lead to should these weapons be send to front-line units as replacements, re-equipping established units rotated from the front-line or train new formations from the ground up with western equipment and doctrines.
 d. The burden on the logistics by a diversified weapon pool, from both a short-term wartime and a longer-term perspective( as some of the western weapons are “endangered species” per say).
 e. The viability to contract western manufactures to produce Ukraine designed weapons, such as Stugna-P or BTR-4.

6. The impact of this war to Non-proliferation, as well as what will happen to the world if the Nuclear Taboo was broken, particularly if some leaders (be it correct or not) get the impression of a limited nuclear exchange is somewhat survivable.

5.	There are plenty of debates regarding Leopard 1 tanks and other western design heavy equipment being sent to Ukraine. I categorized them as follow, and would like to have your opinions.

a.	Whether Ukraine is still in the defensive and fight to prevent sudden-death  stage of the war, thus these deliveries are a distraction to the more important, even vital delivery of the well-established useful defensive weapons (i.e. ATGM and Manpads),as well as other “multipurpose” equipments (i.e. drones of all sizes).
b.	The general suitability of such weapons to the tactical doctrine of Ukraine Army, as they are design and built under a different philosophy.
c.	The required to train crews on these weapons, as they different to what the Ukraine soldiers familiar with, and this lead to should these weapons be send to frontline units as replacements, re-equipping established units rotated from the frontline or train new formations from the ground up with western equipments and doctrines.
d.	The burden on the logistics by a diversified weapon pool, from both a short-term wartime and a longer-term perspective( as some of the western weapons are “endangered species” per say).

6.	The impact of this war to Non-proliferation, as well as what will happen to the world if the Nuclear Taboo was broken, particularly if some leaders (be it correct or not) get the impression of a limited nuclear exchange is somewhat survivable.

This article was a fascinating read. To read what the al Qaeda members were saying to each other about the impact of the drone strikes and the internal problems they were having is bizarre and captivating. Having lived through this period and wondering what was going on in actuality to reading it now is a little surreal.

These documents have been declassified for a few years now but the archive is massive and in Arabic so I never knew what was in them until reading the selection the author used in his methodology. 

It seems like a mistake commonly made is the over estimation of aerial bombing of non tactical targets. On the battlefield in support of ground forces the effectiveness of bombing can change the balance of power immediately as the intelligence is better, targets are more accurately chosen, and the results better exploited. Targeting and organization from the air alone can be effective but it takes a much larger amount of time and sorties to produce tangible results than is commonly estimated. 

In this case the period was in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and any pressure that could be exerted on a deadly adversary was a positive thing. Even if studies proved that an aerial campaign was completely ineffective (studies do not show this) it would be unlikely to have prevented them from being carried out due simply to political reasons. 

-------------

I paraphrased the first paragraph in the title:

&gt; Through a comprehensive evaluation of declassified internal correspondence between al-Qaeda leaders recovered in bin Laden’s Abbottabad compound, this study aims to provide a direct assessment of the effects of U.S. drone strikes on al-Qaeda’s organizational capabilities and performance. That is, the study asks: Did the drone campaign render al-Qaeda unable to replace personnel killed in the campaign with equally skilled operatives, undermine its organizational efficiency or internal control, and reduce its reliance on its safe haven in Pakistan’s tribal regions, as many policymakers claim and theories of its effectiveness imply? If so, when in the campaign did these effects become apparent?

&gt; This study uncovers novel evidence that U.S. drone strikes did have an appreciable effect on many of these dimensions of al-Qaeda’s organizational capabilities. This challenges a bevy of theories and claims regarding the ineffectiveness of high-value targeting and precision airpower in general and the U.S. drone campaign in Pakistan in particular. It also finds, however, that these results were less pronounced than some of the more sanguine assessments might expect and that they emerged quite late in the drone campaign. Targeted killing should thus not be thought of as a necessarily expedient or flawless option for pacifying or disrupting the ability of terrorist groups to plot and execute attacks.

Ukrainians are de facto Russians as Bavarians are german, and everyone who has a bit of a clue about slavic history should know this.

Most importantly, start by asking 10 randomly selected Ukrainians whether they are of Russian or Ukrainian nationality. I think you'll get, overall, a very different answer to your opinion. 

Because what makes a national identity""? What is THE MOST important factor? I'll tell you: A large group of people as distinguishing themselves as distinct from other groups - and running their own country too.

If you ask 10 Bavarians what their *national* identity is, you will most likely get ""German"" as a response.

But if you want arguments, start with the enormous clue of languages. Ukrainian has been spoken since the 1500s and is currently spoken by 67% of the population.

For another argument, look at Putin's own claims of Ukrainians genociding ethnic Russians. How can the Ukrainians be ""genociding"" their """"""own people"""""" if Ukrainian and Russian are not distinct national/ethnic identities?

Read through this article for plenty of cultural, historical, and ethnical evidence of a distinct national identity.

Literally meaningless words. There is no such entity in 2022 as a ""greater Russia"", except when Putin wants it to exist for the purposes of annexing Ukraine's oil and gas fields, boosting his personal legacy, and creating an anti-NATO buffer state.

History, hmm, let's take a history lesson.

There are hundreds if not thousands of ethnicities worldwide, but relatively limited actual origins - thousands of years ago caucasians were all one ethnicity, now they're like 50.  

Ethnicities aren't an absolute, they evolve due to geographical, political, cultural and language differences (many of which are visible in Ukraine) until at some point a group of people considers themselves a separate ethnicity (Ukrainians do).  And then that ethnicity eventually becomes a distinction (it has) - like most human distinctions, somewhat subjective but a generally agreed upon method to classify things.

Like this literally can't be any simpler dude.  Let me show you a cool western meme:

I liked the above resource - for example it touches upon the blocking devices

&gt; the majority of weapons are
equipped with mechanical,
electro-mechanical, and electronic
blocking devices to prevent unauthorized access.14 These devices
can be unblocked only after receiving the necessary codes from Moscow. 

&gt; the traditional Soviet
lack of attention to negative control
over the tactical nuclear weapons
raises some doubts about whether
the blocking devices are actually as
efficient as they are intended to be.
Negative control over tactical
nuclear warheads is reported to be
less reliable than that over strategic
warheads/weapons

&gt; Ukraine would have to organize its own production of raw materials, spare parts, and liquid fuel
for the missiles; in the past, all of
them were imported from Russia.
Undoubtedly, Ukraine’s industry is
developed enough to do that. The
main obstacle is Ukraine’s inability
to allocate the necessary financial
resources for such an expensive program. The rapidly deteriorating economic situation there provides few
chances to appropriate additional
expenditures from the shrinking
budget.
Moreover, even if Ukraine establishes positive control over the missiles, Kiev will face serious difficulties in their operational use.

&gt; If the
Ukrainians develop their own targeting and guidance systems, their
missiles could reach only the distance of, for example, Siberian targets.

&gt; The recent removal
of warheads from the SS-24 ICBMs
deployed in Ukraine provided Ukrainian personnel with important physical access to the warheads. This
access facilitated implementation of
possible technical measures directed
at overcoming the blocking devices
that were installed on the warheads
in order to prevent their unauthorized activation.
Official incorporation into the
Ukrainian Armed Forces of the
troops fulfilling routine inspection
of the strategic nuclear weapons in
Ukraine has led to a situation where
Kiev’s ability to establish positive
control over the weapons is mainly
limited not by technical, but by
broader economic and political constraints",aff67406177aad7163f5495fae5448d1e55bcb8c,True,False,,,,,0,1649847595,,0,{},i4jt8w1,False,t3_u17yua,False,True,t1_i4akqf5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u17yua/did_ukraine_make_a_mistake_by_giving_up_nuclear/i4jt8w1/,1649847610,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649818795.0

[],False,,dropbbbear,,,[],,,,text,t2_4guzp50v,False,False,"&gt;The most obvious interpretation of the war is that tanks are nearly useless, and light infantry, which they're supposedly great against, is now capable of wrecking tanks from beyond tank firing range.

&gt;What's the best counter argument? What could Russia have done differently?

I'll sum up the counter arguments I've seen elsewhere.

Tanks are not nearly useless, as they offer good mobility, great firepower, and the best protection against small arms all in a single package. Even if they are more vulnerable now on modern battlefields due to anti-armour, this vulnerability can be compensated for. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is almost a worst-case scenario for tanks because:

* Ukraine has a *lot* of modern anti-tank weapons that supersede Russia's largely obsolete tanks and defense systems. Russian tanks also have a tendency to have their ammunition cook off and explode after being hit. This is not necessarily going to be the case in other conflicts if another military is using modern tanks and defense systems against obsolete anti-tank weapons. So Russia should have updated its military or stuck to bullying someone who wasn't a near-peer.

* Russia does not have proper control of the air in much of Ukraine; they can't fly low because of very common MANPADS, they can't fly high because of AA systems, and they don't have a fantastic air force to begin with. So they can't send aircraft ahead of tanks to do recon or deal with the artillery that have been the cause of many tank kills. This could have been avoided by having a more modern air force.

* Ukraine has access to NATO high-quality satellite imagery, fleets of drones and other intelligence services, allowing them to spot tanks, which not every country can boast in every conflict.

* Tanks operate best in hilly terrain which offers some cover, and worst in cities, thick forest, or muddy ground. Ukraine is mostly flat, open muddy ground punctuated by cities and thick forest. This forces Russian tanks to stick to roads, making them predictable and easy to ambush with Stugnas or bomb with artillery. Russia could have picked a less muddy time to invade.

* Logistical issues mean that Russian tanks spend a lot of time sitting idle to conserve scarce fuel, making them more vulnerable targets for artillery and atgm's (not necessarily because of moving vs. not moving, but because their location is found and acted on). Russia could have had better fuel sources for the invasion, considering they're an oil exporter.

* Most importantly, troops are not dismounting and spreading out to check for the enemy. So we see videos of infantry getting blown up while remaining on their tank, or hiding grouped up behind it for cover. Better training of infantry could resolve this and more often succeed in removing threats to tanks.

&gt;Are the pro-tank people say that Russian infantry should have dismounted on the border, and walk to Kyiv on foot, with tanks accompanying them at walking speed?

They should have ridden on or alongside the tanks, thus using the tank's mobility to cover ground quickly, up until reaching urban or other risky areas, at which point the infantry dismount. 

Then they spread out and look for atgm threats to the tank, while the tank uses its armor to protect itself from being shot from afar, and its cannon to blow up infantry even if they are behind walls, or to blow up enemy tanks.",07b1a6e98263c7a3c159c60faf127440a574cef7,True,False,,,,,0,1649835902,,0,{},i4jeys5,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t1_i4huwuh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4jeys5/,1649835920,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649807102.0

The problem is that physical destruction- which is the main thing people think of when they hear the word “genocide”- of the Ukrainian nation has thus far been far lesser in scale than happened to, say, the Tutsis in Rwanda. There’s been some massacres, but overall it seems Russia mainly wished to destroy Ukrainian identity through re-education after the conflict. 

However, physical destruction is what most people think of when they think of genocide, though it is only one component. Thus, less educated (or just more biased) people are going to argue that any conflict with civilian casualties (which is all of them) is a “genocide”, even though most wars don’t involve the attempted eradication of a nation. Basically, the term is further devalued.

I also know that a lot of people are going to get confused on the difference between the US officially recognizing something as a genocide, and Biden stating his personal opinion on the matter.

""Security analyst Andrew McGregor described the battle for Antonov Airport as ""Russian Airborne Disaster"". According to him, the initial Russian operation had aimed at securing an early access for the invasion forces into Kyiv to end the entire war within a day or two. Instead, Russian intelligence had failed to assess the actual concentration of Ukrainian defenders around the airport, and assumed only token defenses. As the initial landing force was too small to hold the locality, while the Russian military was unable to secure air transport for reinforcements as well as prevent Ukrainian counter-attacks, this led to the destruction of the first landing force. McGregor argued that the failure to take Antonov Airport and another airport at Vasylkiv at the invasion's start ended Russia's chance to bring the conflict to swift conclusion.[8]

Researchers of the Atlantic Council also argued that Ukraine's ability to defend the airport for two days ""possibly prevent[ed] a rapid capture"" of Kyiv by Russia.[32] Michael Shoebridge of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute argued that ""the rapid strike was meant to paralyse the central government and demoralise the Ukrainian forces"", but that this operation failed.[20] Royal United Services Institute associate director Jonathan Eyal described the initial Russian failure to take the arport as ""a turning point"" in the war.

The same way at some point armies realized cavalry is dumb, unnecessary, and expensive to maintain.

There’s so many old plane models we could hand over to them F15,f16s , f18s and of course some will say “the A10!!!”

We should also train maybe five on the f35 and some on the f22 and give them a discount on getting some of the newer models after the conflict is over.

So glad other people agree, the time to start all this covertly was last year even, we should’ve been training tank crews for select older NATO models last year and just kept them in western countries ready to roll in with the equipment should things escalate.


I also feel that when Russia start amassing troops on Ukraine’s borders we should have responded in kind in Poland etc to actually threaten them and said “ our allies our concerned were allowed to move our troops to friendly countries”.

And lastly especially after Afghanistan withdrawal it was a fatal mistake that encouraged Putin to repeatedly and loudly keep telegraphing weakness by saying “ we will only defend NATO” and “ we will never intervene” basically saying “ go ahead” which from the Crimea situation truly gives the Russians flee that there’s no risk.

If we had amassed troops as fast as possible during Crimea and then when the little green men showed up and Putin denied that they were Russian troops, had nobody thought what would happen if a less predictable American president scared the Russians by saying. “ well if they’re not russian troops we are preparing assets to run selective strikes against these unknown terrorists taking over the Ukrainian government” that would have humiliated Putin.

We simply act far too scared.

We will lose everything simply saying “ we can’t do that it will provoke them” and not even having a nuclear deterrent as when they threaten we back down rather than saying “ we’ll respond in kind”

We consider the Kim regime to be the ultimate crazies when it comes to dictatorships. We're talking about a truly totalitarian state where there is genuinely a fanatical cult of devotion to Dear Leader that has been built for decades, not just a rally around the flag effect spun into high gear by a state news machine. We also consider them to be a rogue and unstable nuclear actor and sort of the most likely ""if someone would use a nuke"" person. Also KJU himself is the archetypical mad, narcissistic dictator and we have straight up proof that he is a ruthless, monstrous piece of shit. And his predecessors were pretty much the same. So essentially, everything we (probably rightly) label Putin as right now but in an even stronger position vis a vis his internal stakeholders. Yet, the Kims has never launched a nuke. They've threatened, maybe they've thought about it, but they've never done it because they know that nukes mean death and the end of the regime. I wonder then, if we now think Putin is crazier than Kim? Or do we now believe the internal pressure on Putin, despite him being insanely popular domestically and seemingly without much of a threat from the elites, is so bad that he has to be crazier than Kim to exist?

I know there are flaws in this thinking, namely that the DPRK is not stuck in a war that is going badly, but I think it is worth considering. I personally don't believe Putin is crazier than KJU or any of the other Kims for that matter. It's interesting that people seem willing to compare Russia as a potential pariah state and the DPRK as a genuine pariah state, but never seem to touch on how that might encompass nuclear thinking as well.",ce308cc8c11aa715a5b07730319f43db8a5f1040,True,False,,,,,0,1649822517,,0,{},i4ivelq,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t1_i4f6adf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4ivelq/,1649822535,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649793717.0

This is part of what's freaking me out regarding nukes. I can see many reasons for not using a nuke, including the one you've provided which is that (harsh truth) nukes are actually kind of useless on a battlefield. As you mention, how would a tactical nuke break a stalemate? Is Ukraine going to suddenly stop fighting if what is essentially a very big bomb goes off in their backyard? Hell no. They'll probably fight harder. That said, I was also able to list out a bunch of reasons why Russia shouldn't invade as well and yet here we are. So I worry my own power of analysis and that of many other individuals I'd usually trust is way off the mark when it comes to the nuke issue as well.   


Now, looking back, I can see the twisted logic and faulty assumptions that made the invasion of Ukraine seem like a good idea. I'm trying to look for them for nuclear use now and I'm not seeing them.

It has not undertaken an across-the-board operational pause while waiting for reinforcements to arrive. In part, as a result, it has made limited gains while continuing to sustain significant losses.

As an armchair general, I can only think of a couple of reasons why this might have happened:

- Political pressure to make advances quickly (before the 9th of may)
- Concern about massing ukranian forces/equipment or entrenchment
- Lacking coordination between Russian units
- The Russians somehow still underestimating the nature of their opposition

Although I don't really have any way to tell which of those explanations are likely or credible. The wording of the ISW report would seem to imply that the Russians are capable of operational coordination and have made this choice deliberately at the highest level. Additionally, considering how the fronts have evolved, I see no reason to believe that they don't expect fierce resistance in the Donbass.

There are probably factors I haven't considered but if the primary reason is one or both of my first suggestions then this next offensive is building up to potentially catastrophic failure for Russia.

I was thinking specifically of rolling through towns and villages. But one of the talking points about the shift of the war to the east has been that the west of Ukraine has heavy forestation, where the east is plains which is going to present fewer ambush possibilities for the Ukrainians.

&gt;Spotting every Ukrainian infantryman with a Javelin? I don't think even NATO has this kind of air force, or could get it anytime soon.

It's not about spotting every Javelin, simply reducing the ability to use them effectively / with minimal risk. There's a lot of videos of Ukrainians setting up in the relative open observing and firing on roads from afar. These aren't easy for armour to spot, but if aircraft, UAVs, infantry were more of a threat then the risk of coming under fire increases so you become less bold in taking the shot. Also, if tanks aren't restricted to roads then they become harder to spot, and your risk of being caught out increase.

&gt;So basically just walk from Russian border to Kyiv, with tanks advancing at walking speed?

No, there's times when you can advance quickly (crossing open terrain) and times to go slowly (likely ambush point/bottleneck).

You're right in that you can't neutralise every threat, but the Russian approach seems (as a distant observer) overconfident and lacking in caution and due diligence, rather than an example of a good use of tanks/combined warfare.

We have given Ukraine upwards of 20% of our total anti-tank missile inventory. Where the equipment makes sense, we're giving it to them pretty much as fast as we can.

NATO has several goals. In rough priority order they are

* Avoid a strategic nuclear exchange at any cost
* Avoid any use of nuclear weapons if possible
* Make it clear to Russia that the NATO alliance is strong and resolute. Incursions into NATO territory will be punished.
* Break Russia's ability to fight for the foreseeable (10-20 year) future
* Save Ukraine

NATO is providing and withholding support to Ukraine based on pragmatic factors. We'd love to give them four squadrons of F-35s and several dozen Patriot batteries, but it wouldn't help. For NATO to avoid direct involvement we'd have to train Ukraine on how top operate, maintain, and sustain those weapons and platforms. That is a huge project and probably a distraction. For comparison, nations like UK and Australia who have deep and long links with the US, speak the same language, and are already using a lot of US kit are taking YEARS to attain operational capability with F-35.

That's why we're largely giving them low-maintenance low-training gear like Javelin and (not-so-simple) Starstreak, or  Eastern-bloc gear that they are already familiar with.

When Putin's butchers use chemical weapons NATO will protest loudly and start executing plans to give Ukraine more high-end gear. NATO is awash with old but highly capable F-16s for example. We could probably train some pilots to a useful level in a few months. They wouldn't be fully multi-mission capable, but they could still make use of the platform.

I would expect a rapid increase in the technology level of supplied equipment, together with an unstated but increasingly obvious program to re-equip Ukraine as we would equip a NATO member.

Per this document, during Dessert Storm 40% of direct support maintenance activities and 30% of general support maintenance was performed by contract workers.
Here is a current job posting for an F-16 technician for operations in Iraq


&gt; At the beginning of Desert Shield combat troops were rapidly deployed to deter an Iraqi attack without the support units they needed to enable and sustain their operations. This shortfall was made up by External Support contractors who aided the debarkation, reception, and onward movement of the troop units. Food, water, engineering material, spare parts, latrines, trucks and buses, and temporary housing were supplied by local contractors.6 Most of the actions of the few logistical personnel in Saudi Arabia during the early parts of Operation Desert Shield were concerned with arranging for External Support.
Throughout the Gulf War, External Support was an essential part of the overall operation. All of the POL and water, most of the construction engineering, most of the port operations, and about 50 percent of the long-haul transportation was provided by External Support. The Army could not have made its historic flanking move without External Support. External Support assets supported Army units in both Iraq and Kuwait.
Redeployment also depended on External Support. External Support was responsible for cleaning equipment to pass U.S. Customs inspections; cleaning, folding, and packing tents; repairing facilities; clearing troop compounds; dismantling temporary structures; providing port services; handling retrograde movement of ammunition; providing flatbed trucks; and performing maintenance.

Contractors have played an incredibly important role in post Cold War Military operations but they serve a far removed role from combat logistics, Ukraine has no shortage of construction, transportation, sustainment capabilities due to fighting a national defense at home. It’s the last mile in military logistics that the hard part and that’s what Ukraine lacks. The same goes for aircraft Lockheed, Boeing, or General Dynamics, setting up a hanger and providing technical support is not the same thing as the ground crews actually keeping flight operations running.",82f0f86b1363c2c66d451c1e83a97f035831eed2,True,False,,,,,0,1649809704,,0,{},i4i2zlb,False,t3_u1xdzp,False,True,t1_i4hy0oo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u1xdzp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_12_2022/i4i2zlb/,1649809715,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649780904.0

Economies can and will recover, and they recover from recessions much faster than if a statistically significant portion of your economic bloc is ravaged by war.

I agree with your assessment that Europe and the west in general needs to come up with a more coherent strategy for sanctions, but I can cut them some slack as the situation in Ukraine has been so fluid. We've gone from assuming Ukraine would be overrun in weeks to a real possibility that with the right equipment and support there's a real chance Russia could actually be pushed back out of some areas they occupied at the start of the ""special operation.""

Initially I think the sanctions were designed to give Putin a ""golden bridge"" to pull back his ambitions and limit the conflict. Since then it's become clear that Russia's ambitions are maximal and long term, and their methods are nearly as maximal even if their capabilities weren't up to it.
