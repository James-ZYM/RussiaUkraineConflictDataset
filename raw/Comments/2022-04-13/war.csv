I think post-Soviet Russia is awful (the USSR was pretty awful too in it's own ways) and Putin is a brutal tyrant. But this war is happening because of cynical geopolitical maneuvering (NATO expansion being the key culprit)  
One can't even criticize Russia AND acknowledge the geopolitical causes of this awful, pointless war without a million screeching NPCs coming out of the woodwork to call you a Putin shill.

It reminds me of Iraq (a war I participated in, luckily after the crazy pre-surge stage). People were in lock step with every insane thing the media was telling them, and if you aired the lightest criticism you were called unpatriotic and pro-terrorist and all that. As someone who has borne witness to this stuff, it really fucked me up to see that people have learned nothing from the past twenty years.

And yeah, there's a lot of stuff out there about our atomized internet echo chambers and brainwashed people buying a brand or associating with a team. Matt Christman of Chapo talks about it a lot. There's a book called Society of The Spectacle you should check out. It was written in the 60s but is still shockingly accurate today. Even if you don't agree with their politics, people like this have been sounding the alarm about this phenomenon for a while.",c0cc2a6ad5686b68596fed34d9349e48349caa32,True,False,,,,,0,1649889410,,0,{},i4mkqjo,False,t3_u2sl1u,False,True,t1_i4mg3b8,/r/war/comments/u2sl1u/freedom_must_be_better_armed_than_tyranny/i4mkqjo/,1649889427,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649860610.0,,,,

The truth be told is currently there is only speculation and word versus word. According to the OSINT (open source intelligence) I've looked at, there were allegations of a chemical attack and then shortly afterward, the area of impact of the chemicals (ground zero) was quickly carpeted by artillery from the Russians, thus masking the location and making the area even more contentious to allow any UN/US/NATO-IAEA personnel further adverse to entering into the battle space in order to collect samples in order to (IOT) confirm/deny any CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Nuclear or Radiological) employment, and by whom. 

In reality, with all of the desk-pounding and red lines drawn by some NATO members, it stands to reason that any samples taken and confirmation given would only result in doubt, ""negotiations"" and ""deliberations"" from those NATO members, because they themselves would then be in the 'hot seat' to ""walk it as they talked it"", and show the world that they meant what they said, and actually followed up with a commensurate action. 

I do not put it past Russia to use some sort of heavy chemical, thus forcing those below ground and in hiding, to have to exit their hides, and must more worse for the wear. The people in both r/Ukraine and r/UkraineWarVideoReport seem to lack an adequate number of military veterans and think with their hearts, rather than understanding the 50k altitude view of the conflict writ large, so a lot of them cannot conceptualize real ""false flags"" and when they would be strategically viable and resonate on a global scale. 

If the attack is legit, someone in Ukraine is in close contact with the right authorities outside of the theater of war, in order to collect samples and maintain some level of a ""chain of custody"". If the attack was a false flag, then the UKR and AZOF pax will go back to the drawing board, knowing they burned themselves and will not ever be believed by the UN or NATO, ever. 

If the attack is legit, Russia will do all in their power to deny access to the area by anyone and any accurate collection of evidence will be their undoing (to an extent).

Expansion 2: Syria will begin to expand their warfare against the resistance forces with the direct support from Russia and Iran, until Iran is able to establish a sold presence in the northern regions of Iraq, thus setting the conditions for a de facto bridge into the Med. 

Globally: Numerous European nations will probably feel like they ""bet on the wrong pony"" with NATO and try and take on a more neutral position. China will take advantage of the situation and begin to ""slice off"" pieces of bordering Asian nations, or puppeteer them (Myanmar/Burma) and the Solomon region in order to establish both a physical and military hegemony in Asia. 

The worst of the worst will be decision-makers and shot-callers and things will only get worse. 

Granted, this is all speculation based on the question asked, but the US alone is no longer able to meet a dual-front conflict such as fighting the Nazi's and Imperial Japan simultaneously, let alone fighting Russia, China, Iran and N. Korea with what the US is currently facing without a coalition. Losing Ukraine to Russia, after pumping so many materials into the fight, without committing forces (even if a Presidential Finding for covert action, has been signed and approved) is not going to lay any kind of foundation for building a NATO or Quad+ coalition to defeat what will come (on a global scale), if Russia is not defeated.",71175ee585be05df5fe4eed089e960e25da9d1fc,True,False,,,,,0,1649885094,,0,{},i4ma8ca,False,t3_u1sots,False,True,t3_u1sots,/r/war/comments/u1sots/if_russia_takes_over_ukraine_then_what_happens/i4ma8ca/,1649885106,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649856294.0,,,,

The only way for Ukrain to issue a major counter offensive is if some outside party intervenes, attacks russians on a fairly big scale to make russia divert resources to said fight.. swaying resources that are directly engaging the ukrainian army... then they could build momentum and start to push their lines.. 

Sad fact is, this isnt happening. The rest of the world is shitting their pants in worry because putin also has a button that could wipe millions off the map. Nukes are what destroyed the ideology of an ""honest war"". When nukes are involved, no neighboring country or ally will be kept honest.. no well wishes will be made true.. no substantial help will follow. 

The reality of the situation is that the world is watching ukrain slowly die while doing very little to stop it.

The world is doing the equivalent of

IMO, the lack of action in Syria against Russia, or targeting operations in Russia, is the fault of we in the USA. We should have done something, but a mix of factors including but not limited to; failures in foreign policy primarily by the executive branch, racism in America against ethnic Muslims and Arabs, some of us grew up seeing things like Daniel Pearl, many were afraid of relations with Russia, and some of us lost ourselves in the politics of the Middle East, forgetting people don’t deserve such treatment, they deserve freedom under a government that represents them, but it must represent THEM.

This racism and failure in foreign policy doesn’t quite carry as far in Ukraine, as the majority of people can directly relate to these white Slavs, having their homes 1st world destroyed by an authoritarian state that doesn’t recognize the peoples right to even exist, it reminds me of nothing in the last 60 years of conflicts.

The US is getting the chance to field-test some of their newer equipment and take out Russian equipment without putting a single boot on the ground.

Exactly. So what are we talking about here. It is all about fuck russia. About Iraq and CNN i agree - also fuck US in that part and people who did that. But still for Europe it is most important to fuck Russia.

About US in that topic - i really dont know why they help so much about Ukraine and i dont care - it is great and i love it.

70% of russians believe Poland should be next target, they really hate us. And due to history and what they are doing i hate them back, it is personal as i even know people who died defending Ukraine as almost 2 millions Ukrainians lived in Poland before war. My business contact Ukrainian went there to defend his country and died. So i dont give fuck what some troll in internet imagine about them being a Nazi country.

Ukraine never invaded anyone or even thought about it. They just want to be independent. Really sound like nazi?

1. Never gather in large groups. ( In this case even worse on an open street.)
2. Setup forward alarm posts/guards to monitor.
3. Always expect to meet lone / leftover enemy combatants.

In Donbas there was enough of a Russian Ukranian population to help the Russians invade and successfully occupy it so far.

Russian army had around 1 million troops before the invasion, while Ukraine has 250000 military personnel and about 200000 armed forces.

Sun Tzus art of war says a commander should have at least a 5 to 1 ratio in his favor when beseiging a fortess, I guess you could say this would usually be sound advice for an invasion as well.

Russia underestimated Ukraine and overestimated them selves, now regrouping forces to the east as weve all heard. Change in command comes change of strategy. 

I think Russia was planning this invasion since before Crimea, I think the only reason its happened now instead of 5 years ago is Putin probes the wests leadership, both times hes invaded under American democratic leadership.

Democrats are too bureaucratic maybe Putin believes, so far he would be right, this allows him to bully smaller Ukraine while the western countries look at American and Nato leaders to get their act together, by the time they do muster a response....He already has more of Ukraine.

Not like Republicans would fare much better, theyd be far too aggressive and probably ignite nuclear warfare.",5569aee34e775e84210e0ccb384a0f45cdd7e1c4,True,False,,,,,0,1649817103,,0,{},i4ik82p,False,t3_u1sots,False,True,t3_u1sots,/r/war/comments/u1sots/if_russia_takes_over_ukraine_then_what_happens/i4ik82p/,1649817115,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1649788303.0,,,,

That crematorium has been debunked lol, those videos and pics are literally from 8 years ago. Unless there is new video or evidence i havent seen yet. Im an ex marine/ contractor multiple tours. I've seen war crimes get brushed under the rug,  and i've literally conducted false flag operations. This needs properly investigated, because both azov and russia are capable of committing all these direct attacks on civs. I've seen videos of ukrainian soldiers commiting war crimes on russians as well. Idk if they are real, or true, or being investigated. I remember A ukraine talk show host talked about killing russian children as if russians were a disease needing eradicated. Im sure the russians probably dehumanize the ukrainians as well. The dehumanization needs to stop. I hate war, i regret killing men and women for my country and then for money as a contractor.
