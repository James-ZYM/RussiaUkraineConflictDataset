The ""strategic ambiguity"" is no better than a simple ""I don't know what to do"" type of indecisiveness. The idea of empowering Taiwan to defend itself over the next 30 years is a complete pipe dream. Obviously, this is not how it looked like in the 90s. Oh, time flies.

The Taiwan issue is also tactically paralyzing the US. Currently, China can easily respond to any American military challenge to Chinese oversea interests by posing to invade Taiwan and lure Americans back, where winning is much easier. If Americans wish to challenge Chinese infrastructure projects militarily in, say, Africa, then the current American Taiwan policy, resulting in their own tactical paralysis, is completely idiotic. If Americans do not wish to utilize their superior military power in any way, then, um... Good luck.

The imminent threat is also obviously not a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Taiwanese leadership is borderline politically mute, so the chance of their actions provoking a military action is about non-existent. Remember, the US is still selling weapons to Taiwan.

It's so funny when this is said by an argentinian, hahahahaha.

Thankfully there are poor places in the world that have seen success, developing countries where people can expect a positive change do exist. China has spearheaded the development of the whole world for the last 30 years. 

Think where China was 30 years ago and where was Argentina. While Argentina has stalled and regressed in the last 30 years, China has made more progress than an average country makes in 100 years. That's a model that poor countries all around the world should emulate, and there is finally an alternative to the neoliberal destruction and plunder that the west imposes on the world.

All 3 of those countries were conquered in a war and forced to host US troops for decades... Sure, by now the public has accepted it, and it's not like they have a choice, as it's much harder to force US soldiers to go home than you think.

&gt;Can you name a Chinese ally that would feel the same? Hell would NK even allow that? (I'm seriously asking this question and would love an answer from any one who knows).

NK had Chinese troops during the war with the south, but that was 70 years ago. The fact that Chinese troops left NK willingly, while US didn't leave SK, speaks volumes about actual independence of both countries.  
As far as I know, the only Chinese foreign military base is in Djibouti, but I wouldn't call Djibouti an ally of China, as they also host military bases of several other powers.

People often say America is too self focused politically (which is true in many ways) but China tends to be even worse on this. As you said they will often leave these authoritarian leaders to rot when thing don't work out, largely because China doesn't care at all about other countries interests when they have nothing to gain directly. Wolf warrior diplomacy doesn't really build long term trust with other countries. America for all its many many many flaws still be and large still trust America when it comes down to it.

Hell would NK even allow that? (I'm seriously asking this question and would love an answer from any one who knows).

Also China is in a rather bleak state right now economically with multiple internal crisis that are sucking away time, attention, and resources. Zero COVID is expensive to maintain and drags down the economy. The housing crisis risks destroying one of the biggest sources  of economic growth, house hold wealth, investment, and is result in serious job loss. The looming international oil, fertilizer, and food crisis are also a disproportionate risk to China. China imports a large amount of all three, and can't really do anything to increase domestic production or at least not without years of expensive infrastructure projects. Their domestic agricultural production is already extremely efficient and it's unlikely they could easily free up more land. Fertilizer is critical to keeping that system as efficient as it is and a shortage would make this difficult since fertilizer production is a very industrial so increasing local production would take time.

""For the past decade, Chinese President Xi Jinping has endeavored to help China attain what it considers to be its rightful position at the center of the world stage. To do this, Xi—along with the rest of China’s leadership—is attempting to consolidate the country’s economic, political, diplomatic, and military power. It is also working to counter U.S. pressure in the Indo-Pacific region. Xi’s desire to turn China into the world’s most powerful state is, after all, coupled with an inextricable corollary: the imperative of stopping what he sees as efforts by the West to contain it.  
But China’s grand strategy includes a third component: asserting its dominant position over a different international system of states. Chinese policymakers are attempting to create a sphere of influence comprising not just their country’s immediately contiguous region but also the entire emerging, non-Western, and largely nondemocratic world—the “global South.” Securing dominance over this vast swath of nations would provide a strong base for China’s power while restricting the United States’ actions and influence.

All in all, it will be interesting to see how maneuverable Turkey will become foreign policy wise once it resembles Argentina after its economic collapse.

For years now Moscow resized its presence in Syria, very few soldiers and planes mostly using low-tech bombs and equipment + economic support to Assad's regime is minimal, very often Damascus had to BEG for wheat supplies and more.

On Turkey, well Ankara clearly demonstrated that it is not able to secure its areas in the north, who are hostages of its own armed gangs, widespread corruption, internal turmoil, hostile cells and more.
Also, the economic situation, due to crisis in Turkey, is poor.

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"&gt; Business leaders have declared the acceleration of deglobalization and sounded the alarm about a new period of stagflation.

What a strange sentence; almost as if to imply a policy by ""business leaders"" by decree.  Doesn't work that way.  Economic trends have merely followed in response to the conditions created by Joe Biden's policies influencing the landscape.  Supply chain vulnerability is the sole proximate cause of the combination of post-COVID 19 trends described as ""de-globalization,"" and that vulnerability is solely the result of the governmental response to COVID 19.  

Further, in view of the Biden administration's reckless spending (among other failures) throughout the pandemic on top of the other harms caused by the COVID 19 response, stagflation was inevitable.  If we're now operating from the perspective that the world isn't as flat as we previously thought it was (for those new to this subreddit, that's a reference to Tom Friedman's book, so titled), that's due solely to the policies of governments the world over. 

&gt; Academics have decried the return of conquest and hailed the renewal of transatlantic ties.

The academic commentary on these trends I've seen has been unsatisfying, almost without exception.  At least from the so called foreign policy establishment.  That being said, Marco Polo's world (again, another reference for those new to this subreddit) isn't fully back yet, either.  But we'll keep moving in that direction, to the extent the Biden administration's foreign policy approach continues to sunset the United States' role in global leadership.  

&gt; These dramatic shifts have overshadowed another profound transformation in the global energy system.  For the last two decades, the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions has gradually reshaped the global energy order.  Now, as a result of the war in Ukraine, energy security has returned to the fore, joining climate change as a top concern for policymakers.

I agree that Vladimir Putin's aggression against Ukraine has profoundly disrupted energy markets.  But reference to the concept of ""energy security"" is curious.  Continental Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas and petrochemical resources more generally is a known vulnerability, as it has been since the existence of the Soviet Union.  This isn't new.  Control over European energy markets has been an issue for more than the last two decades as an issue of geopolitical significance, and it has only been brought to forefront due to the game-changing reserves discovered by Exxon (and others) around 2013 in the Black Sea.  

Russia's control of the natural gas supply to Europe and more broadley continuing influence over energy markets in general depends on the structure of the competitive landscape.  This influence is the key source of Russia's ability to influence politics on the European continent.  To illustrate, if non-Russian suppliers develop the capacity to supply the European continent, new supply alternatives exist to displace the functional monopoly currently held by Russian oil and gas companies.  Examples abound, but the most significant manifestation of this relationship is in Germany's historical reluctance to hold Vladimir Putin to account in view of the risk that Russia might turn off the gas.  

It turns out there are tremendous natural gas reserves in the Black Sea, including within Ukraine's EEZ (even more so before Crimea was lost).  Ukraine, obviously, had no incentive whatsoever to cooperate with Russia on developing those fields which previously were not.  Ukraine was moving in that direction and negotiating/partnering with certain non-Russian companies for those purposes.  

Essentially, Ukraine very well could have been --- and probably still will be --- the alternative supplier to displace Russia in at least the Russian natural gas space. This is a game changer, across the board.  Though it's probably obvious, here's an illustration: if Germany (and others) no longer have to depend on Russia, then Russia no longer has the ability to threaten to shut off the gas, to extract political concessions on the continent or otherwise influence European foreign policy.  That mean's Ukraine's strategic value is completely redefined, as well.  Before those Black Sea reserves were known, Ukraine had no pathway to NATO membership.  Now, Ukraine's pathway to NATO membership is obvious.

Somewhat relatedly, much confusion surrounds discussion of Ukraine's potential NATO membership.  Certain purported academics (such as John Mearsheimer) claim, as they have for years on end, that vague and ambiguous agreements were informally reached between the United States and Russian Federation, in the couple of years immediately after the USSR's implosion.  

Those individuals argue effect of ""Ukraine's membership in NATO represents continuity of a encircling trend, at the expense of Russia's 'sphere of influence',"" or so the story goes.  This argument is incoherent, because if those were the goals, then Ukraine would already be a NATO member and the subject would have been settled when Russia was far weaker, during Yeltsin's rule.  Further, if encirclement was the goal, then the Budapest Memorandum wouldn't have likely even been papered.  Rather, Ukraine would have just ascended to become a NATO member, which is what it wanted all along and has wanted since the moment it became independent from the USSR.  

Except that is not what happened at all.  Rather, Washington's concern was nuclear nonproliferation --- a potentially catastrophic risk to global security, given the USSR's operational incompetence with respect to security over its supply of nuclear arms and technology.  Then, Ukraine's concern was that if they gave up what they had, left over from the USSR, Russia would treat Ukraine as a vassal state or worse absent NATO membership.  Now, and over the last decade or so, that risk has been reduced from theory to practice as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly violated Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  

&gt; Together, these dual priorities are poised to reshape national energy planning, energy trade flows, and the broader global economy. 

This kind of language is difficult to take seriously.  So called ""green"" advocates express no interest in nuclear power, the sole technology that has the ability to meet current or future needs (and by implication, the sole technology that has the ability to replace coal-generated electricity).  Yet, these self-styled ""green"" advocates oppose nuclear power's expansion almost without exception.  

Though I assume most who are familiar with this subreddit are already aware, Germany's inexplicable aversion to nuclear power is the reason why it is beholden to Russia.  To sustain demands on Germany's electrical grid, it has to burn natural gas.  Natural gas Germany burns for this purpose comes from Russia.  As a point of comparison, France's electrical grid is not so encumbered, because France has (for now, at least) an outstanding nuclear utilization rate.  But that said, I agree energy planning is critical.  Germany lacks the infrastructure to import LNG because it does not have the facilities to convert.  Most of the existing infrastructure comprises Soviet-legacy pipelines over land, across the continent.  

Germany either has to import LNG to meet its needs, which it lacks the ability to do at this time, or come up with some other alternative.  And if Germany is going to take this seriously, it will not put its eggs all in the same basket.  Solar and wind have their place, but no one familiar with the technology rationally believes they can replace coal.  Nuclear is the only option for sustained grid demand, and Germany should have started moving in that direction 30 years ago and stayed on course.  Natural gas will continue to play a role in Germany's electrical demands for the foreseeable future, so to the extent grid demands can't be met with whatever else Germany is doing (whether solar, wind or anything else), it should be developing the infrastructure to import LNG.  
 
Europe needs to follow France's model (except to the extent that anti-nuclear voices seem to inexplicably be gaining ground there), in any case.  Electricity generation by coal is no longer a viable means and must be replaced, for reasons that should be obvious.  Coal can only be replaced by nuclear, but nuclear can't meet fluctuating grid demand.  Other options have to be available to supplement, and natural gas is the least worst means to that end at this time.  Likewise, so called green advocates need to understand the technologies they advocate for.  The useful life of wind turbines is a lot less than people realize and their carbon footprint is woefully undervalued.  Same with solar.  And both suffer the same reliability problems, because it turns out that acute increases in grid demand don't reliably correlate with the weather.  Sometimes that is true, but it has to always be true for those technologies to be viable in the absence of storage capacity.",da49a96a3384e04f0f094ea459de3b07653c57a9,True,False,,,,,0,1654778793,,0,{},ibq4xu5,False,t3_v6xh36,False,True,t3_v6xh36,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6xh36/the_new_energy_order_how_governments_will/ibq4xu5/,1654778807,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654749993.0,

But in that context, if Turkey manages to install their own regime in power, there would be a lot of mixed feelings for that in the west. Because it would be an act of aggression very reminiscent of Russia's war in Ukraine (at least how the Russians imagined it would go).

And yet, We have seen many experts recently saying that the US and China may be heading to war.  
In this episode we will learn in which trap the two countries are falling into and how Thucydides is related to all this.  
Let's start from the beginning. Thucydides lived around 2500 years ago.  
He was one of the earliest Historians.  
Thucydides described the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta in great detail  
 and he had the rank of General in Athens.  
In his book ""The History of the Peloponnesian War"" he wrote that the war between Athens and Sparta  
was inevitable because the great growth of Athens  
frightened the Lacedaemonians (Spartans) and forced them to fight.  
American political scientist Graham Allison called this dynamic, Thucydides' trap,  
and explained that when a rising power threatens to displace a dominant power,  
then conflict is the rule, not the exception.  
He also led a study in Belfer Center from Harvard University  
that identified 16 historical cases in which a rising force threatened a dominant one  
12 of these 16 cases led to war.  
Let's take a look at today's situation.  
From 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union until today, the United States is the only superpower in the world.  
But China's growth is so rapid that causes fear.  
I will mention only one example of China's huge growth.  
In 1978, 90% of China's population lived with less than $ 2 a day.  
Since 2020, this percentage has dropped ... to 0.  
This is an economic miracle, hard to believe but also hard to ignore.  
And it seems that China leads the way in many sectors.  
This is what we are facing today, a seemingly unstoppable rising China  
accelerating towards a dominant but Immovable US  
on a course that could be the greatest collision in history  
Finally, let's think of it from the point of view of the US.  
Hypothetically, If the only US goal was to not be overtaken by China, what should it do?  
The answer is that it should clash with China as soon as possible,  
before China gets even closer.  
The forces of history are leading US and China to war, but circumstances may have changed.  
Today, a war of this magnitude will be catastrophic for everyone.  
Everybody's interest is to prevent it.  
The great question that will decide our lives in the future is this.  
Will China and the US let the forces of history lead to a war  
catastrophic to all of us?  
Will we go to another Cold War?  
Or will we learn to work together and share power?

The East African Community is a regional block made up of 7 countries in the Eastern part of the African Continent. The countries include Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and newest entrant, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

DRC joined on 8th April 2022.

Among the questions it addresses are the history of the East African Community and importance of DRC joining the East African Community.

In 2020, the African Development Bank noted in a report that despite Covid-19 disruptions, East Africa was still the fastest growing region in Africa [https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/press-releases/east-africa-holds-its-ground-africas-fastest-growing-region-despite-covid-19-disruption-36809]

EAC's relevance globally also appears to be significant. The EU, UK and China, for example, are making great efforts to deepen their relationships with the East African Community.

The EU recently lifted the 6 years financial sanctions it had placed on Burundi (an EAC country). The EU has also ramped up its support programs within EAC. Among the areas EU is focused on are innovation, capacity building and digital transformation.

In 2017, the UK high commissioner to Tanzania and EAC said the UK would strengthen trade and investment links with EAC [https://www.eac.int/press-releases/151-international-relations/717-uk-to-strengthen-ties-with-east-african-community]

China, on its part, is the main EAC partner regarding infrastructure development.

Michaël Tanchum, a policy fellow at the Africa programme of the European Council on Foreign Relations, said something interesting early this year.

He said, ""Any country that doesn’t have a constructive relationship with Africa is going to lose its relative position in the global economy.”

Why? Because in the next 20 years, according  to Michael, the supply of affordable labor will come from Africa and the markets will also be in the continent [https://www.ft.com/content/e9000149-f344-4d6f-9b53-586b8f49ca17]

East Africa being the most integrated region in Africa with a population of 300,000,000 will be an important region to foster relationships with.

Also, the entry of Democratic Republic of Congo into the block has significantly raised the value of the entire block. DRC has the world's largest reserves of cobalt. Cobalt is a crucial tech-enabling metal and the UK and US have classified it as a Critical Raw Material.

 If the entire block can find a way to maximize the benefits of these cobalt reserves, it might be a game changer globally.

The article also looks at the importance of regional and political integration in the region and why citizens of the region should care.

It is Part 1 of a series focused on the East African Community. Part 2 looks at the first pillar of the East African Community-- Customs Union-- and the benefits it has brought.

What do you think? Will the entry of DRC to the East African Community be as important as analysts seem to think? Also, will the efforts towards regional integration in East Africa allow East Africa to be relevant globally?",bd5f9d27c2cba0f451d94c1e11ac79321675f5d3,True,False,,,,,0,1654766794,,0,{},ibpoih9,True,t3_v8cte7,False,True,t3_v8cte7,/r/geopolitics/comments/v8cte7/frequently_asked_questions_about_east_african/ibpoih9/,1654766808,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654737994.0,

This is one article, plus with ergodan renaming turkey. Because ergodan renamed turkey my interpretation is he is emulating Ataturk who named turkey.  

Turkey named after Ataturk. 
Under his leadership, the Republic of Turkey was declared in 1923, and he was honoured with the name Atatürk (""Father of the Turks"") by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1934.


and my other  reason for my premise that  the president of turkey is trying to revive an empire is the rumor that is unsubstantiated I add .   
that the coup in turkey in 2016 was staged so ergodan could clean the army up.  With all these  facts and rumors it makes me come to the conclusion that turkey is going to leave nato.  


The army has ran turkey and most of the disciples of Ataturk who was in the army father of modern day turkey have launched multiple successful coups. Against Islamist leaders 
 The list of coups  and suspected coups are as follows 1960, 1971,1980, 1993 ,1997 and 2016 but the some people in turkey say that was ergodan was cleaning house of the pro western military leaders who probably would coup him right about now. 




Then you have to look at if Russia is helping Assad why is he taking his soldiers ? 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/world/middleeast/syrian-mercenaries-ukraine-russia.amp.html

It’s plenty more articles on this subject 

https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-60931180


So you have Russia taking soliders from Assad to Ukraine and turkey who is dependent on Russian gas and wheat going into Syria .    

Does that make sense ? 

If Russia is helping Assad why are they taking his soldiers to Ukraine who should be fighting turkey right now in Syria  ?  Why is Assad allowing this? 

That’s my basis for saying Assad abdicates to Russia.    

Then you have Iraq basically under the thumb of Iran.
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/584356-how-worrisome-is-iranian-control-of-iraq-for-the-us/

If Turkey is successful in taking over Syria  couldn’t it emboldened Iran? 

I have no sources for Iran and turkey splitting up Iraq but it’s my theory.  

Finally on to Israel bombing Iran, it’s been reported Netanyahu is gaining ground on Bennett.

In the 60s and 70s, Syria did ally with Jordan and Egypt at one point, against Israel.

I have thought about this, but let's be honest - Saudi Arabia despises Iran far more than Turkey, and probably won't interfere with any potential Turkish offensive in Syria.

&gt;2. In trying to “take care” of Kurdish problem, Turkey may end up uniting the Kurds into a strong, singular block?

Perhaps, but is this a better alternative to having the Kurds outside of Turkish control, being forced to constantly invade Iraq and Syria? Turkey certainly seems to think so.

&gt;3. While Russia may certainly become weakened, losing Syria loses them the last foothold in the Middle East, along with a prized port (can’t remember the name). Would they really exit completely?

The port you're referring to is Latakia, which really doesn't give Russia much other than the prestige of being a Mediterranean power. Russia's future is not looking very favorable, I think they will have far bigger concerns going forward.

&gt;4. Seeing how a power vaccum caused the emergence of Isis in Iraq, western allies maybe reticent to let Syria completely collapse for the fear of isis re-emerging. So while they may not like Assad, alternative maybe far less desirable

The assumption is that Turkey will take over security in Syria. But, of course, the Islamists who Turkey plans to put in power in Damascus may participate in international terrorism just like ISIS, despite Turkey's wishes. Which will then become a European and American problem. And yet, for the West, having a NATO ally in charge of counter-terrorism in Syria would be preferable to leaving Assad in power, I think.",9056d02d45a4362e044ceb360950cc4ddc360ccf,True,False,,,,,0,1654753857,,0,{},ibp9vj2,True,t3_v81x64,False,True,t1_ibp15mm,/r/geopolitics/comments/v81x64/syria_in_the_next_1020_years/ibp9vj2/,1654753872,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654725057.0,
