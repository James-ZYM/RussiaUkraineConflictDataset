It’s now almost exactly a month later and to my knowledge Macron has not made any statement to debunk the claim. He could have easily have written a message on Twitter and said that the claims made about him asking Ukraine to give up territory as a concession to Russia are not true. Only takes a few seconds.

Why hasn’t he done that? Well, Macron also said in February that he was in constant contact with Zelensky (see Twitter). This was before his speech.

&gt; Mr. Putin described the land Peter conquered as rightfully Russian.

&gt; Mr. Putin said that when Peter founded the city of St. Petersburg on the captured land, &amp;quot;None of the countries of Europe recognized it as Russian.&amp;quot; That remark seemed to be a clear reference to the present day, when no Western country has recognized Moscow&amp;#039;s claim to Crimea, much less to the parts of eastern and southern Ukraine Russia has seized in the last three months.

&gt; In recent days, Russian officials have been promoting the comparison between Mr. Putin and Peter with special energy; the governor of St. Petersburg on Thursday said that he felt the same pride for today&amp;#039;s Russian soldiers in Ukraine &amp;quot;As we take pride in the memory of Peter&amp;#039;s warriors.""

I'd say however factoring in what will be the state of the Russian economy in the next several months he just won't have the capability to relaunch a massive new offensive across the wider Ukraine unless their is a tipping point that pushes Russia into general mobilisation / complete warfooting. 

And then there is what Ukraine can achieve in stopping him controlling Donetsk and Luhansk.

Western armaments are small in number slow to arrive and train up and then there is still the ammunition issue.

The only reason they're 'winning' anything is that people from the US don't keep up with EU politics (why would they), Boris Johnson having to keep busy with international politics because he's fucked when it comes to internal politics, and some Eastern European countries, namely Poland, using the Ukrainians they care so much about for petty revenge. 

&gt;  Yes Poland could have quietly done this, but Poland really, really doesn't want Ukraine to fall and Russia on their doorsteps. 

No, they couldn't have. They'd actually have to worry about the consequences of sending them if they did. Poland has been a NATO-member for 20 years. They know full well what is up and that they're never in a position of risk. Every time Russia comes in contact with NATO what happens? They get whipped and don't retaliate. See US and UK massacring them in Syria, or Turkey shooting down their jet. 

&gt; So they create a political headache for the US and Germany. 

Yeah, as always. And you're helping 'em, why? You do realize how quick the mig story disappeared for new shit that has to get debunked? Poland knows, the EU members know, the US gov, DoD know, Germany knows but has to swallow their tongue. If you create a political headache, do it like Zelensky and Kuleba; be publicly outraged to bring attention, but acknowledge and approve internally. 'Macron's phone calls' for example. 

&gt; US president Biden had US senators publicly saying to send the MIGs and politically it furthered the US response to the war because the US public was like WTF, why aren't we just sending these. 

That's on senators who to my knowledge have a disproportionate amount of former legal experts in their ranks being too dishonest to them call out, preferring to use it against other senators, I guess. 

Who is the US public, btw? Because every US serviceman knows, especially the active duty ones on the border of Poland - Ukraine as we speak. They can't even set a pinky toe in Ukraine, do you reckon that they have any illusions about the migs? Their spouses and friends surely know, the families of Politicians surely know, every lawyer in the country knows, etc. Surely them knowing is equally if not more valid than the unknowing part of the citizens' shock? 

&gt; Germany wasn't ready to even mentally handle a war was going on in their backyard.

The reason Poland, politicians, and people online can pull this shit is because Germany cannot respond until they, as the largest consumer of gas in the world, are off of it. I know you won't care much because you don't live in the EU, but if the German economy collapses, we all do. Seeing a supposed EU member &amp; ally chirp like this in the middle of a massacre because they got told to respect gays and minorities a tiny bit years back is fucked up. 

They're doing a decent job on the gas so far, somehow the lense is still on them, not on Poland and the Baltic nations guzzling Russian oil. 

The truth is probably that everyone is somewhat shocked because we handled Russia with gloves for years, yet knew he wasn't delivering the paid amount of gas and oil to any of our member states, was hoarding foreign currency, etc. No one knew he would actually be so stupid until it was too late. That includes Poland, every EU member, and the US. I say too late, but we have been training them specifically for Russia since 2014. 

France would be equally fucked by this bullshit propaganda treatment if their energy wasn't sourced elsewhere and they didn't make the majority of their exports public straight up. They're simply undeniable and they still deal with an enormous load of shit from their ""allies."" With friends like these... 

&gt; Can you link to evidence Germany has sent at least decent arms support since 2014 when considering the size of their economy? My guess is probably not. 

No, because as I said, they don't release their figures. They mostly release half-truths about their exports. They tell the UN the bare minimum (it's a joke, read the requirements lol), emphasize their commitment to the Agreement signed in the always sunny city of Wassenaar and throw a few mil in for the cause, and most importantly, they don't report their numbers to COARM. The only shit that gets released is when undeniably German products are seen on the battlefield or in another country's possession and they have no possibility of denying it. You can look up ""Waffenexporte"", but you'll mostly get one website and opposition newspapers.

But you believe Poland without seeing a shred of evidence, why not me or them? 🤔",2351f1b898b470620bbe745037eeb50a492ccded,True,False,,,,,0,1654811923,,0,{},ibs8a24,False,t3_v8jvmx,False,True,t1_ibrsuaw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8jvmx/it_now_turns_out_that_germany_wont_send_the_m270/ibs8a24/,1654811936,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654783123.0,

The Netherlands must continue to support Ukraine. Ultimately, it is up to Ukraine itself to determine when the war will end. That is what Wopke Hoekstra, Minister of Foreign Affairs, says in conversation with Nieuwsuur. He warns that the war can go on for a long time and that this will also hurt the Netherlands.

CDA leader Wopke Hoekstra has been Minister of Foreign Affairs for five months. Since the beginning of the war, the Netherlands has been supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself against Russian aggression. The Netherlands now also supplies heavier weapons. According to Hoekstra, it is important that North America, Europe and therefore also the Netherlands continue to supply these weapons, introduce sanctions and help with reconstruction.

""You have to get on with it,"" says Hoekstra. ""This new phase also calls for different types of weapons. Imagine if we hadn't done it: you must not have the illusion that the whole country had been overrun by Russia. Then it would never have ended with Kiev as it is now. is finished.""

According to Hoekstra, it is impossible to say when the war will end. ""In the end, I think it is up to Ukraine to decide how long the war will go on. They are the ones who suffer the most terrible losses. They fight first and foremost for their own peace and security. But with that the war is also about peace and stability of all Europe. It is essential that we continue to support them in this, not only morally, but also geopolitically.""

cold reality

According to Hoekstra, the purpose of the heavier weapons is that Ukraine is as well able as possible to defend its own territory. ""That's important. The cold reality is that it gives them strength on the battlefield, and with it the best possible position at the negotiating table.""

The fear of escalating the war cannot be brushed aside, says Hoekstra: ""At the moment we have no reason to think that it will become a bigger conflict, a bigger war. But it is not for nothing that NATO allows individual countries to to supply weapons, to make a substantial contribution, but not to monitor the airspace. That would mean that you would come into direct conflict with Russian aircraft. Then you run a huge chance that the flames are in the pan.""

Ukraine's EU membership remains a point of discussion for the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expects the candidate membership to be awarded later this month at the European summit in Brussels. But so far, the Netherlands has put the brakes on.

Hoekstra says that the cabinet will look with an open mind to the judgment of the European Commission. ""It is up to the European Commission to make a sensible judgment about what needs to be done. Then you must be prepared to look at it openly as the Netherlands.""

Corruption in Ukraine in particular is a thorny issue for the Netherlands and Germany. Yesterday a Ukrainian delegation visited the House of Representatives to lobby for candidate membership. Delay would not only be bad for Ukraine, but also for the EU, they argue.

Ukraine lobbies for EU membership
Hoekstra warns that the war could go on for a long time. ""You should not have the illusion that if the Netherlands were to stop with weapons, the war would be over and the economic sun would shine again. You have to be realistic that we are not only likely to end up in a much longer conflict, a value conflict. have been touched with Russia, but also that that war can last a while. And that this will also hurt, also in the Netherlands.""

According to him, it is up to the cabinet to ensure that the consequences of the war remain bearable for its own population. ""But you also have to be honest, that war will last for a while. The consequences can be felt all over the world, including in the Netherlands.

""Our goals are: Ukraine needs to be given the tools to defend themself and do so successfully"" is the often repeated original quote. Twisting that to the narrative of ""he carefully avoids to even talk about the possibility of Ukraine winning"" is considered journalism nowadays?

&gt;""he surprised the Ukrainians, allies and experts with his decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks, which Kyiv hadn’t asked for""

The government originally replied that they need to refurbish their Gepards and that there is not ammunition, so they need to check what is available.

Then there was a constant communication happening between the government and Ukraine's embassy. You could basically follow Melnyk's tweets of alternating between ""Why is Germany not delivering Gepards"" and ""We don't want Gepards"" based on what the state of procuring ammunition was at the moment. So he definitely got those infos. Then Germany's search for sources of ammunition got even more public when Switzerland denied exports.

Only then Scholz announced Gepards we learned that non of the communication seemed to have reached Ukraine. Is that a German error when Ukraine's official in Germany can be shown to react to information that for some reason then isn't relayed?

&gt;""Polish President Andrzej Duda, who accused the German government of breaking its promises on military support for Ukraine, which just entered its fourth month of intense fighting. Poland has donated over 200 of its own Soviet-made tanks to Ukraine and was counting on Germany to replace them with modern German equivalents""

Maybe Poland should have made clear in the negotiations that modern NATO tanks does not mean NATO tanks widely used today but ""the newest model of Leaopard2 not even in regular production"". If you believe that Germany actually agreed to send them nearly 2 billion in Leopard2s for free I have a bridge to sell you.

&gt;""Berlin further argued that it could not spare any tanks from its own reserves. Yet German defense companies like Rheinmetall say that they could directly deliver decommissioned tanks from their stocks — if Scholz authorized them to do so. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Ukrainian officials say they began discussing the Marder deal as far back as March with Rheinmetall, which told them it could deliver within weeks. But so far, Berlin has refused to greenlight the deal.""

Rheinmetall's original offer was 100 Marders that will need all year to refurbish. Their own CEO said mid-May that the very first few units will probably be ready in about 3 weeks. So there are actually no Marders or when we believe they for once do not underdeliver on promises as usual there might be a handful now finished.

Yet Axel Springer fantasizes about hundreds of Marders just waiting for delivery and blocked by the government since March.

&gt;""claiming that NATO countries had collectively agreed to not send any Western-type battle tanks or infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.  
Möller’s comments triggered an immediate backlash from the German center-right opposition. “Such an agreement does not exist,”

So why are there zero modern NATO MBTs in Ukraine right now? Where are the Bradley's, FV432s and VBCI's delivered while Germany is the only one not delivering their active used IFVs? How did all NATO countries coordinate the announcements of soviet style tanks, modern artillery or recently rocket-artillery always at the same time if there are no agreements?

&gt;""Yet while Germany successfully implemented such a “Ringtausch” with the Czech Republic, the sharp criticism from the Duda highlights that Berlin is struggling to make such a deal work with Poland""

So Germany traded older but still active models of Leopard2 with the option to upgrade them to newer versions (and an option to get the newest line when it's finally build regulary) for even older soviet-style tanks and this worked. The very same agreement with Poland fell through because Poland obviously got an agreement for the newest version right now, although this doesn't even exist in numbers yet. Sure, obviously Germany is the problem here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll even add that Ukraine is more a liberal democracy than Russia, while Saddam was a tyrant with much blood on his hands.

Still, while I won't exaggerate and say Iraq is destroyed, it is still very much wounded.

&amp;#x2005;

What if a third country sent soldiers to help Russia in Ukraine, and 18 got killed. Would you celebrate their deaths?

Russian claims to Crimea, however unjustified for invasion and annexation, are nonetheless far stronger than possible hypothetical claims of US to any Iraqi territory, and if you wish to go back further, no one's entertaining the idea of giving it back to the Tatars.

Probably Iraq is controlled less by the US because of the 8 years of resistance.

I don't know how many Iraqis—or Afghanis—are in Guantanamo Bay.

While Chomsky and Stone yammer on about NATO, I think Bush—who in my view was far worse than Trump, as bad as Trump was/is—made Putin look good during the 0s. Putin might not have been as strong or bold today if it wasn't for Bush.

Even to this day, Iraq is, somewhat at least, a client state of US as was Afghanistan.

and those great weapons US is sending to Ukraine were made by companies that got very rich on Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and probably still will.

&gt;Russians are winning the war. 20% of Ukraine is occupied so far and probably more in the coming weeks.

By your logic Nazi Germany won the war. And try **zooming out** instead of studying one small part of the map. In reality the conflict map has *barely changed* for an entire month, and Severodonetsk is not that strategically important. Ukraine is fighting hard there because of the simple addage that you *don't interrupt the enemy when he's making a mistake.* Russia is suffering severe military casualties for *political* points rather than actual strategic value. Ukraine is taking advantage of that. Its value is so Putin can make proclamations to the part of his base that doesn't spend time monitoring the specifics of the war. A Russia focusing on the long-term of the war would not have been doing what it is doing now.

Not a rotten one that could have been put there after some action in the woods, but rather large pieces. Unfortunately, the purpose of the bark is unknown for sure. 


For the bark specifically I think it is definitely to disguise it from the top to make it harder to spot by drones. 

&gt;We can only assume that this is how the russians hope to change the thermal signature of the car in an attempt to deceive a Javelin missile.

Maybe for the sandbags, like sand does insulate a bit. Like if you've ever been to the beach, sand on top is hot, but you don't have to go to far down for the sand to get cool. But that's not going to make a huge difference, you can't pile enough sandbags on the tank to mask it enough. I feel like they are probably more afraid of artillery than Javelins at this point. 

So I'm pretty sure the sandbags are supposed to just break up the silhouette and probably look like rocks from above. I'm not sure why they didn't do anything to the barrel though. Wrapping some cloth or zip tying some leafy branches to it would blend in from above. Right now it kind of sticks out.

No clue what the box of rocks on the side is supposed to do though.",9bdf7983a796c95c88c247ba0cbe2982eddc210e,True,False,,,,,0,1654809879,,0,{},ibs3rak,False,t3_v8qek0,False,True,t3_v8qek0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8qek0/stones_and_bark_instead_of_grills_russian_tank/ibs3rak/,1654809892,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654781079.0,

There is a great podcast (sadly in german) between a  journalist and a retired german general that previously commanded the german troops in the Kosovo and is (even though retired) still working in an officer training capacity for NATO (currently training with polish trainees in warsaw) that offers a great picture on the german military (by the way he is heavily oppossed to even sending 7 PZH2000 because he considers it Scholz breaking his word of not sending weapons if it weakens the german army (yes 7 guns are already a big blow to the german army, its that bad). He also explains why it takes that long for germany to deliver stuff (basically the german army has to go from barracks to bacrracks collecting stuff from the units using it...we had the same problem with weapons send to afghanistan or Mali were units beeing deployed had to go ""looting"" their comrades (that stay in germany) weapons so at least the units deployed in a war zone were fully equipped...while the units at home were basically empty or jsut had an incompelte mess of weapons to train with. German arms companys also were absolutely not preparred for a major war and there is little capacity to fullfill their contracts and rebuild/upgrade weapons for ukraine at the same time. Add to that the fact they do maintanance in germany its even worse. Compare that to a country like the neatherlands that recently reduced its artilelry units and now had spare artilelry guns standing around they only had to dust off and put on a train to ukraine its a vastly different situation (try explaining that to the average redditor on this sub and get called a russian supporter, traitor, etc.) resulting in far longer delivery times. I have to be honest, the fact the PZH2000 and Gepards are supposed toa rrive within a few weeks in Ukraine is faster then I expected. I really hope they havent been skipping anything important in maintanance or training the ukranian crews do to public pressure that will bite urkaine in the ass later. There arent any more coming anytime soon after all (the german army high command is already not exactly happy about the heavy weapons beeing given to urkaine to say it politly. Cant imagine what went down behind closed doors...if any more heavy weapons are going to be taken from them the army general inspector might even thwor his job in protest lol. Not because they hate ukraine but because of the situation of their army I described above a bit).  
In short, Russia started shit in the worst possible moment for the german army. The defense budget has been increasing for a few years by this point but obviously not much of the new investmeants or plans have taken effect until today yet. Cant build a tank in a few days after all. All Leoaprd 2s are individually manufactured pieces and not assembly line work these days resuöting in long building times of like 3 years...  
Im honestly suprised by the ammount of smalla rms equippmeant germany already provided to ukraine. basically all of germanys infantery anti tank weapons, anti air weapons and anti tank mines have been send. And I know its a meme with the german helmets before the war, but germany has send some 20.000 in total so far. I have no idea where they got those helmets from. When they send the first 5000 my room mate who is in the army and training to be an officer basically told me those helmets were not from a stockpile...they were taken fromt he people doing ""voluntary conscription time"" (what was conscription before it became a voluntary thing) and these people have to train with field caps now. So I can only imagine the ohter 15.000 helmets beeing taken from some barrakcs were nobody has a helmet anymore now.  
To get to a conclussion (finally)...the german army is pretty much incapable for a variaty o0f reasons to offer significant support, especially in heavy weapons, to ukraine becuase it has basically 0 vehicles in stockpile and you cant take many vehicles from the active military units do to the high rate of non working vehicles. Every operational vehicle send to ukraine means weakening the german army and threatening its capability to uphold, its NATO obligations. Its why germany tries so hard to make arms deals iwht easterne uropean countries so they send their weapons instead. Giving Marders to greece for example is better then giving them to urkaine because greece can wait until they are all repaired properly until winter 2022 while ukraine needs weapons asap and that is what greece can provide. Same logic behind the arms deal with czechia (old Leopards for T72s to ukraine and later modern Leopards) or the one with Slovakia (germany putting its patriot AA systems into ukraine to take over AA protection so Slowakai can send their S300 to ukraine (until Slovakia gets new AA obviously).  
In short, I dont think germany can shine when it comes to delivering arms but I hope its going to shine when it coems to helping ukraine rebuild its country after the war with humanitarian and economic support where germany is far more capable to assist. Winning the war wont be that great alone if Ukraine looks like Warsaw 1944 for years to come after it. A quick recovery is in everybodys interest after all.

Germany has given Ukraine around 2 billion to buy arms from other countries with to my knowledge. And Germany is eather the biggest or second biggest financial supporter of Ukraine since 2014 with something like 4-6 billion in economic support directly or through the EU.

Germany has reduced dependency on russia in the energy sector already massively. Coal imports are supposed to end this summer, oil imports (with the EU embargo) will end this year and gas is supposed to end in 2024 (it is the most difficult one because gas doesnt grow on trees and its hard to transport compared to the other two). But generally speaking imports from russia have already been massively reduced and continue to be reduced day by day.

On the german army, yes it sucks...for a continental war. The anwser is rather simple: 9/11. With the afghanistan war german military doctrine changed from continental warfare to expeditionary warfare. The german army doesnt have the budget (and efficency to use that budget properly) to do both like the USA so it had to focus on one and so everything involving. So now 20 year later the german army can do intenrational missions somewhat good (german troops in Mali for example) but obviously they cut down on the continental defense force (you dont need SPAAs or heavy armored SPAs to fight insurgence and you dont need 2000 tanks for that, 200 will be enough). After 2014 the german army basically went ""oh crap russia is starting shit"" and reworked its investmeants into a continetal force again. Until 2030 the tank force is supposed to be increased to above 300 again, the SPAs (PZH200) increased to above 200 froma round 140 right now and all german weapons get modernized for example (upgrade to Leopard 2A7+)...obviously this wasnt remotely finished when Russia decided to throw shit at european peace like nobody since WW2 and invade their neighbour to wipe them out.

Add to that the usual problems with the german arms industry (expensive new weapon developemeants that are usually delayed for eternity \[Puma or the FCAs jet with Franc efor example\], political shinanigans (defense ministery is basically the ""we dont know where to put you"" ministery and gets the short stick all the time), the german military budget (many dont know that the german soldiers and retired soldiers are paid their salary from the yearly military budget as well...which is around 20-30% of it just going to personal salaries each year), the german army fucking up maintanance and outsorucing it to the arms companies whi have basically become the Leopard repair shop instead of producing any (on average only 60% of german heavy weapons and vehicles are operational...in some areas it can be worse), measures to safe money bitting germany in the ass from years ago (not buying new ammo/ creating a stockpile...germany has ammo for 2 weeks of war and then we throw stones according to one general; germany lacks ammo worth 20 billion...yes worth half the yearly budget). 

And most of all the biggest reason germany cant send much to ukraine is rather simple: Germany emptied its cold war stockpile entirely unlike msot european nations. Basically every Leopard 2 in the service of other countries was formerly from the german army and after its initial reduction in stockpile. Additionally Germany sold of basically alol the weapons it inherited from east germany, the soviet sytle ones, to eastern european allies and ""poorer"" countries in eruope. BMPs went to Greece, Finland and Sweden; Migs went to Poladn for a symbolic price of 1$ per plane and so on. Even the Gepards that were taken froma ctive service in 2012 I think were sold back to the german arms companies and then sold to other countries like Brazil that used them to defend the Olypic games in Rio de Janaeiro against terrorism (drones). So rather literally the german armys storage is empty. Ever weapon germany sends now apart from a few manpads  are literally taken froma ctive duty soldiers. Sending 7 PZH2000? 7 crews have no vehicle anymore. And this is even amde worse by the horrible state of operational equippmeant I mentioned earlier. Everything taken and send to Ukraine cant be quickly replaced and reduced the ammount of operational weapons germany has even more in case actual war break out with Russia. Add to taht the fact Germany has masive NATO contributions for 2022 and 2023. Germany basically provides the main force of the Rapid Repsonse Force for thouse years (it rotates yearly, germany got f\*cked by beeing in charge while Russia invades) and germany leades one NATO BTG in Lithauna (which si going to be masssively increased with more german units as of made public a few days ago). As you might imagine these missions basically occupy 80% of all operational german weapons and vehicles (aint sending the broken stuff to Lithuania). So even if Germany decides to go ""f\*ck home defense,m we use Poland as a shield and send everything to Ukraine we have available""...they literally couldnt do it do to NATO obligations.

The US has recently sold F-16's to several countries. If poland wants to buy F-16's the US is more then willing to sell, but as this article states, poland either wants them for free or reduced in price and thats where the issue is.

I assume Poland would rather leave  EU than take this mental disease seriously, as in Poland and Ukraine lgtbt issue is solved perfectly: anybody can do whatever they want among consenting adults, but pride parades, promotion in schools and drag shows are just unpalatt\\able to absolute majority of the people. This is just one issue.

Similarly to Switzerland, Poland will never open the doors to tens of millions of african economic refuges. What that means, is that in sane society there is no discrimination based on race or other immutable characteristic. Any African is welcome to do business and work in Poland or Ukraine. However, freeloading and inviting hordes of useless people who will never work in their life and will have 5 wives and 15 children, will not be accepted. Estonians will never agree to accept 200,000 economic refugees, as it would be perceived as a threat to their national identity. How will Europe handle another 10 million refugees?

This article gave me a stroke. It's Ukraine that asked other countries for post-soviet jets because Ukrainian pilots can fly them. You can't just give somebody an F16 and expect him to fly it because he's a pilot.   


Secondly Poland is no position to give away modern NATO jets because we have like 50 of them. We cannot handover our entire air force. 

There is so much wrong with that article I don't even know where to begin.

The title gave me a stroke as well. Of course Poland is willing PURCHASE ( THAT MEANS PAY ) for new jets.   


The reason we're looking into purchasing those jets is because nobody would do a backfill for us. And the second reason is because 28 Mig29s make up for like around 40% of Poland's total air force. We can't just disarm the country like that. 

Of course Poland is trying to strike a deal on this because why the hell not?

Oh, I totally believe that you feel this way. But what you feel and what your country does (and doesn't) are very different things. This war had become possible to a great extent because of German anti-Ukrainian policy. And now instead of fixing that, Germany simply sabotages it. Russian are committing genocide of Ukrainians and what your country does? OK, Scholz is the problem, but the rest of the country does nothing to change that.

For all it's blustering, Turkey doesn't want to get kicked out of NATO otherwise Russia will be looking for revenge for their support of Ukraine, or at least just plain old conquest. Owning the Bosporus straits is a strategically important move, Russia would if it could and Turkey knows this, and I'm sure they'd much rather have half the world on their side if Russia decided to come knocking.

On the other hand, NATO doesn't want to kick Turkey out, because... they own the Bosporus straits. Keeping Turkey IN NATO means keeping Turkey OUT of Russia's sphere.

I fully agree with everybody that Turkey is currently a shitshow, and not ideologically aligned with the rest of NATO, but remember that at the end of the day, NATO (In it's current form at least) is a DEFENSIVE alliance, not an Economic or Ideological alliance. Turkey is a strategic ally for control of the Black Sea, so one way or another they're not getting kicked out of NATO. 

I have no doubt that eventually the rest of NATO/ the EU will be able to pressure Turkey into letting Finland/Sweden join, perhaps they'll even get threatened behind closed doors, but in the meantime, Finland and Sweden have security guarantees from several NATO nations, so for current purposes, they're basically in NATO in all but name.

I see it as an act of desperarion and a very short sighted one. 

Perhaps Russia wants to be seen as a peace maker in the region, although historically they've supported Armenia. 

Public opinion in both Armenia and Azerbaijan have shown sympathy for Ukraine.

Armenia has historically been dependent on Russia, but is showing some desire to be more open to other regional relationships. 

Of course, the fact that Azerbaijan is an oil and gas may also be a reason for Russian disruption.

Either way, Russia doesn't have the manpower or the materiel to conduct fighting on 2 separate fronts for an extended period. The 2 countries don't appear to have a real desire to restart the conflict.

Not really. Severodonesk isn't even a particularly strategic town. The Ukrainians taking it is keeping the Russians occupied whilst Western weapons arrive in Ukraine - and withdrawing wouldn't even be the worst thing.

When Russian troops are well separated from the Ukrainian and their artillery can keep shelling for a while without getting shelled themselves by counter-artillery, the Russians usually win terrain.",e674b6f3744c2c34397d176ea13717cdd7560e19,True,False,,,,,0,1654805548,,0,{},ibrtrvn,False,t3_v8mxqs,False,True,t1_ibrnz2q,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8mxqs/severodonetsk_armed_forces_control_most_of_the/ibrtrvn/,1654805565,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654776748.0,

If you want to say that certain things are off limits democracy, I agree. You can’t legislate an unfair and unequal position onto someone.

And the natural state of things is no regulation/parachute, so putting an artificial and discriminatory law in place that affects only one team is both against the law and morality. It’s not fair to injure or impair someone just because you don’t like the status quo. 

Plus enacting said legislation would deliver lower quality sports. There’s a reason teams like Man U and Madrid have international fan bases - a level of play that can’t be matched by other teams. They stage the football world (in this case) up.


Now if the sports league has an arbitrary law that say, gives the rich team more cap space than someone else, or an extra million dollars, that it actual legislative inequality.

The other problem with legislation like that we can see in sports drafts, when you penalize high performance people stop performing - you see this is American sports with teams tanking their season when they are out of the running for better draft picks

Unfortunately, there is no downside to these guys dying for Russia, but many upsides. It will discourage foreign mercenaries. With the sanctions and the UK stance, there is no more leverage.

1. In 2021 Germany imported oil and natural gas from Russia to the value of 19.4 billion euros. [1]

2. Since the war started and up the 10th of May, Germany has donated financial, humanitarian, and military aid to a total value of 2.3 billion euros to Ukraine. [2]

3. Since the donation data is 1 month old let’s assume that the number is now higher, 3 billion.

4. Let’s also assume that Germany has decreased its energy imports from Russia with 20%. I don’t have any up to date numbers with the actual figure. If you know the actuals then let me know.

5. If I’m in the right ballpark then by now Germany has paid Russia for at least 5 months of oil and gas. Last year the monthly average was 1.6 billion euros. If we deduct the 20% reduction then the number will be 1.3 billion euros. Take that times 4 months and the total amount of money that Germany has paid to Russia from the beginning of the war up until now is 5.2 billion euros.

6. Germany has paid Russia 5.2 billion euros and in the same time period donated 3 billion euros. That’s a difference of 2.2 euros.

Its propably similar as with tje Iris T system Germany wants to send to Ukraine which will be taken from a batch beeing produced for Egypt and Egypt will receive their delivery later.

But truth be told I can only speculate if thos is the rrason because I simply dont know. Zhere definitly has to be more to it then just the same deal as with Hungary, otherwise Czechia would never agree to disarm itself and send T72s to Ukraine until Leopards actually arrive.

Also were are the Leopard 2A4s coming from for training? Are they from the arms company or the german army?

The Russia media has admitted to this - saying its to prevent Ukrainian military from escaping disguised as civilians and because they need to interrogate all Ukrainians to find the ""Nazis"".  So, even the brainwashed Russians know this is happening.

The point that I think go to some Russians was explaining that if someone in Kherson or other occupied territory didn't want to live under Russian rule, saw themselves as Ukrainian and wanted to leave, they can't. They would be arrested, at the expense of Russian taxpayers, and likely interrogated and potentially jailed for speaking out against the invasion and Russian occupation.  If that Ukrainian who wanted to leave didn't submit to the Russian authorities, they likely would face an extended jail time. 

Perhaps their kids would need to be put into foster care, they could have elderly parents who would need someone to care for them.  But none of them could just leave occupied territory. Russians are forcing all of them to stay, to be ""filtered"" to determine who is pro-Ukrainian and a ""Nazi"" to be potentially jailed or even executed.

And the brainwashed Russians like to argue that those ""Nazis"" deserve it.  But then I asked them how they could like it if China invaded Russia and occupied their town and did the same thing to them.  That finally seemed to get through to some of them.

There's no reason to force Ukrainians to stay in occupied territory with the massive expense and disruption to the occupiers unless the plan is genocide.  The Russians could just let anyone who wants to leave Kherson go to Ukraine and they'd have far less headaches to deal with people who hate them and are protesting. But instead, they're forcing them to stay against their will. Why would the Russians make their job occupying Ukraine more difficult unless their goal is to kill any Ukrainians that oppose them, hence they need to trap all of them there.",938ec96e6f3c209a2edacee9989d971f3e972705,True,False,,,,,0,1654803925,,0,{},ibrpz09,False,t3_v8osct,False,True,t3_v8osct,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8osct/russia_is_trying_to_organize_the_genocide_of_the/ibrpz09/,1654803939,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654775125.0,

They do not seem to have a kind of mobile reserve to conduct large scale counterattacks to take advantage of the times when a Russian attack fails. 

Zelensky has said he wants to form this kind of force to conduct offensives but lacks the equipment and vehicles to outfit them. 

I don't think the fate of Severodonetsk will be decided by the head to head clashes in the city but rather by the activities elsewhere that disrupt supply lines and reinforcements which can very easily make the holding off the city impossible, even with heavy weapons. Because with heavy weapons, you still need ammunition to supply them as well as food and all sorts of other things for the soldiers and other personnel, not including civilians who are also trapped there. 

The Russians have more or less unbroken supply lines back to Russia. The Ukrainians have only two roads. One passes next to Nahirne, which is where those heavy clashes are happening. If that is taken that is the supply potential just cut in half immediately. It's also next to the frontline and subject to shelling even if it's not immediately taken by the Russians. 

Look at the map.

Bakhmut is a central location for distributing supplies for that entire front and it is being shelled daily. It distributes supplies along the main road past Nahirne and to Siversk. and then East. 

This isn't rocket science. If the Russians take Nahirne you can probably count the weeks until Severodonetsk falls and until that entire frontline collapses.

There were a lot of reputable international organisations monitoring the situation in the Donbas, including the OSCE (of which Russia is a member), the OHCHR and Amnesty International. None found anything close to the allegations suggested by the Russian Government.

Nobody talks about Minsk though so I’ll rant a bit about that because it summarises the situation in my opinion. The original Minsk II is in Russian (that totally banned language remember) but here’s an English translation. [https://horlogedelinconscient.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minsk-2-Full-text-UNIAN.pdf](https://horlogedelinconscient.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minsk-2-Full-text-UNIAN.pdf)

Take a read of it. It's only 3 pages long. 

Now Minsk II required certain constitutional changes, but was fairly vague on what these were to be. That isn’t unusual, international agreements are normally pretty vague. The point is to provide a framework to work towards in boring behind the scenes discussions. And this was the problem.

After Minsk II was ratified, Ukraine passed a law which, as per the agreement, approved special status for the Donbas and called for local elections, much to the annoyance of Ukrainian opposition politicians who thought it was giving into Russia’s demands.

So Russia must have been pretty happy with this right? Not quite, they criticised it because the elections were to be held legally under the jurisdiction of Ukraine. There is nothing in Minsk II which says this is an issue, but Russia was making it one. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-status-idUSKBN0MD1ZK20150317](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-status-idUSKBN0MD1ZK20150317)

Now normally this would just be a little wrinkle to work out behind the scenes. So Ukraine approaches Russia to discuss it, and Russia refuses. Why? They claimed they were not a party to the agreement, but were only mediators – like France or Germany. If Ukraine wanted to discuss it, they would have to discuss it with the LNR and DPR authorities, who were the real parties. 
https://tass \[.\] com/politics/865384

Only, Ukraine couldn’t discuss it with the LNR and DPR authorities, because to do so would be to recognise their legitimacy, which they can’t do until they hold elections. And we go in circles. 

So who is right? Was Russia a mediator along with France or Germany, or were they an actual party? Take a look at the document for a hint. 
[https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/5/b/140221.pdf]

There are no signatures from France or Germany (mediators). Russia’s signature is the third from the bottom, alongside the DNR and LNR authorities (parties to the agreement). 

Russia is essentially demanding Ukraine implement sweeping constitutional changes, based on a single paragraph of text, while refusing to talk to them about what they will view as acceptable based on an arbitrary (and easily disprovable) legal distinction. Instead they sit back, wait for Ukraine to try to implement it, then say ""No no that's not right, why are you refusing to implement Minsk?""",fce81c2e8aa9e956d2c09d0b1fb0be06945d2f39,True,False,,,,,0,1654803039,,0,{},ibrnx6x,False,t3_u7w8nf,False,True,t1_ibqw0f7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/u7w8nf/ukrainianconflict_megathread_6/ibrnx6x/,1654803050,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654774239.0,

&gt;Poland has decided to consider the possibility of purchasing US-produced M1 Abrams tanks. Among other things, the country will need to determine the extent to which these tanks would improve the army’s capabilities in view of the current threats. Poland’s political elite still consider Russia the primary threat to the country.

&gt;Starting next year, Poland will commence with a 15-year program to upgrade the army and navy. As part of the program, the Polish command intends to replace the army’s “outdated T-72” tanks.

https://breakingdefense.com/2022/04/poland-considering-italian-korean-alternatives-to-backfill-mig-29s/

&gt;WARSAW: When the saga of Ukraine and the MiG-29 played out last month, the plan seemed fairly simple: Poland would ship its Russian made jets to Ukraine and the US would provide older-configuration Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters to Poland as a replacement.

&gt;But while politics and loose lips appear to have sunk that deal, Poland has not given up on finding backfill options if it decides to transfer its MiGs in the future — and neither have defense aviation firms from around the world, who smell an opportunity to break into the Polish market.


...

&gt;Second, there is the larger hurdle that Poland wants to receive either free, used aircraft or some other cheap option in return for handing the MiG-29s over to Ukraine. This makes the other European possibilities less attractive for the simple fact that the Poles would have to pay for these aircraft, unless the EU would agree to fund the acquisition in return for the MiG-29s being transferred to Kyiv.

A bit of background on Bayraktar the song, the composer and the drone. All links go to the relevant wikipedia page. The key thing for me is the song is actually a very good song. Well written lyrics and a fantastic melody. It would be popular and a hit whenever it had been released. 

[The Song ""Bayraktar"" was released on 1 March 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayraktar_(song)) and became an instant hit (bad pun). It pays hommage to the Bayraktar TB2 combat drone. It was written by Ukrainian Taras Borovok.

[Taras is an Ukrainian colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Borovok), producer, singer and songwriter. He was asked to write the song shortly after the 24th of February. Taras said it did not take him long to write - 2 hours from start to finish.

The ""real purpose"" of the chemical pencils was to use in the Hectograph copying process (the reason they turn blue and corroded is because the inside is not graphite, but aniline dye).  Yes, they're tamper-resistant and can't be erased, but that is just a useful side effect.

Of course, unless you had a print shop or somewhere that books and posters were produced (or were making Samizdat copies), you wouldn't *know* what hectography is, because it was always a niche process not used by the majority of people.  

The great thing about it, though (as far as England goes, which is where I'm from)  was that it didn't need a machine. You could buy a mimeograph for £30 in the 70's, or a Banda machine (alcohol duplicator) for £50, but if you had a baking tray and some Jell-O, you could make a Hectograph for free.  And if you routinely used hecto ink (either as a chemical pencil or hecto ribbon) you could even type up a letter and copy it later.  Not possible with a mimeo stencil or a Banda master; if you had a letter or a book that already existed, you had to *retype the whole thing* onto a master (шаблона) and then run the master through the machine.

Mimeo and hectography used essentially the same ink (mimeo stencils were basically paper sheets impregnated with aniline dye).

Germany remains ""Ukraine's biggest financial stabilizer,"" Chancellor Scholz stressed in Berlin on Tuesday. An overview of the aid provided by the Federal Republic of Germany in detail.

&gt;Within the military support, the Bundeswehr also makes an important contribution to military training and advice in Ukraine. This form of support enables an intensive exchange of experience. To date, a total of 551 Ukrainian servicemen and women have successfully completed their training in Germany.  
  
Germany provides further military support in the form of medical services. This includes the overall financing of a deployable field hospital as well as other measures such as the distribution of medical supplies and materials, but also the medical care of wounded soldiers in German military hospitals.

Holy shit the ignorance here.

&gt; People in US have high-powered rifles 

5.56 NATO (this is a reference to the ammunition that those scary black ""AR-15"" rifles use, at least most of them) is **not** considered ""high-powered"". That's literally why the US military just awarded (last month IIRC) new contracts moving to a different rifle with a bigger cartridge (6.8) which *still* isn't as big as what are known as ""main battle rifles"" aka 7.62 x51 aka .308 caliber. 5.56 NATO is considered an ""intermediate"" cartridge.

&gt; high-capacity magazines

You can buy really large magazines for them, but what people like you call ""high-capacity"" are typically what the rifles come with. Also known as ""normal"" or ""standard"" capacity. Let me be clear here: 30 round magazines for these rifles are *standard*. Admittedly I don't own an AR-15 - I own an IWI Tavor x95. It's functionally the same thing though, and it literally came with a 30 round magazine in the box. Not. High. Capacity. High capacity would be 40 rounds or a 50 round drum magazine.

&gt; Donating them to where they are needed would make a difference.

To reiterate. Unless there are exceptional circumstances as in the US, going by raw cash alone us trying to find the  tallest dwarf.

A lot of people don’t understand how throughly unprepared for war most of NATO is. If you thought the Russians were hilariously underprepared, NATO is not in a much better position for offensive operations.

NATO relies on the joint nuclear arsenals of the UK, US, and France for deterrence. Everyone knows that the NATO presence in the Baltics is competent insufficient to defend against Russian aggression. It’s unlikely that any realistic force could prevent the fall of the Baltics due to the utter lack of strategic depth available.

The idea of NATO is to ensure that Russia will have to end up shooting soldiers from the US, UK and France if it wants to invade Europe, which could well trigger a nuclear response. The conventional forces are there for deterrence, first and foremost.

In addition, the paper was relatively soft, absorbent and did not stain hands.

Plastic bags - we solved it with sewn cloth bags or ""net bags"" from textile cord. If you bought fish and wrapped it in a newspaper in the store, then the bag was not important.

Ballpoint pens - even now it is difficult to find exactly what you want, but there was no problem (it cost about 35 kopecks at a time, when the monthly salary of a worker was 70 rubles and utility payments were around 10 rubles and food for a week cost 5-10 rubles).

Hair bleaching was not a problem because chemistry was taught at a good level at school. Virtually everyone knew what acids were and that they could be neutralized with alkali, and in no case could their fingers be pushed inside. Hydrogen peroxide and ammonia were available in all pharmacies. To prepare the required solution learned to calculate.

Books are an interesting thing. In those days, the worshipers of Soviet life wrote piles of waste paper. Books by good authors and classics were also printed, but to a lesser extent. In order to buy the readable book you wanted, you had to find out which bookstore and when it might be delivered. In addition, Soviet manure (usually one good book and three propaganda books) had to be bought together with one good book. Knowledge can be gained from books, so we read a lot - there was no internet.

In fact, in the big cities the supply of goods and products was difficult, but in the smaller ones it was more difficult that it was not always possible to buy milk after 11 in the morning, cream and mayonnaise had to be ""hunted"" in shops. There was a time when one person could not buy more than 2 loaves of bread. The toothpaste was a strange white mass that turned into a stone as it hardened.

The second you do that to Russia, it’s a nuclear war. You won’t be able to make an intervention in the Black Sea, you cannot militarily engage them without your fleet, and you cannot bring your fleet there.

For me this whole scenario feels like the death rattles of a world that is being left behind. The reality is at no point in mankind’s history have we had such prosperity, equality, world peace and diversity.

The chief argument behind Macron and Scholz's reasoning is based on intelligence gap. The French and German secret services focus on domestic issues. Neither believed Vladimir Putin would attack because they are sceptical of the CIA — who lied to them about WMDs in Iraq, and other international conflicts throughout the years.

  
That created an environment of distrust across Europe, leading to a refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in France, Germany and Britain. The net consequence was foreign policy was based on mood-feeling rather than empirical analysis of foreign intelligence. This explains why Macron fired his intelligence chief for not predicting the war.

  
Macron and Scholz have different reasons for dragging their feet. Macron fears rising energy prices because the fuel-based gillet-jaune protests severely damaged his reputation. Scholz believes that Ukrainians are rash and uneager to engage in democratic processes. I am convinced they believe Ukraine's lack of compromise and negotiating skills, coupled with nationalism, caused this conflict. It goes back to Minsk.

  
Now, it will be difficult for France and Germany to hold out ad aeternam. The majority of Europe supports Ukraine, along with the US and Britain.

I have a theory and I’d like some thoughts on it if any of you much more informed people wouldn’t mind:
I think the Kremlin and the CCP want to drag out this war as much as possible. With every new advanced weapons system NATO sends to Ukraine is a truck load of valuable intel for the Kremlin and CCP. They are studying NATO equipment and capabilities both militarily and economically. Putin’s response to Sweden and Finland working towards NATO membership reinforces my belief; going from threats of scorched Earth to eerily accepting. Drag it out, let the western countries send out equipment and financial aid and hopefully weaken them a little or a lot. Study the effectiveness and the weakness of the equipment, cry wolf from time to time with nuclear threats but never outright pull them into the fight YET. The CCP and Kremlin know they don’t stand much of a chance against NATO, even if they formed a military alliance in attempt to defeat NATO.
China is, publicly, against Russia’s invasion. They’ve been sending small amounts of aid to Ukraine and keeping a distance from Russia’s ventures. My theory is that this is simply because, again, they aren’t ready for an all out fight with NATO; they want to at least appear unsupportive of Putin’s war efforts for now. China still, if I’m not mistaken, broadcasts Russian media propaganda which they wouldn’t do if they didn’t at least support some aspect of what Putin is doing given the tight thumb the CCP has over Chinese media.
Again, I’m not very educated on geopolitics which is why I’d like some opinions, but I don’t think this war dragging out is a good thing. I think the CCP is playing neutral and gathering intel while NATO gives Ukraine whatever they can manage to give away while keeping one eye on Taiwan. I think this could be, very realistically and very rapidly, heading towards a WWIII scenario and the Ukrainian invasion is just a step in the process.

While the war continues - support Ukraine with weapons and pressure Russian economy - which might be more or less effective. Russians might feel the decrease in their quality of life, but we just accept it all like docile animals.

Say, the war is over, Ukraine wins - and gets it's territories back. Putin is in still in power, or there's another shithead, or a fighting groups/clans.

Or the war is over, Russia gets Ukrainian lands and wants more - and threatens Baltics, or Moldova, or whatnot - its appetite is terrifying.

What is the appropriate punishment? Before Nurenberg 2.0 is possible to hold specific people accountable, Russian government needs to change completely.

Is economic failure of the country enough? Russia has enough resources to survive decades with the worst conditions, keep the nukes and still be a threat.

2647,[],False,,miragen125,,,[],,,,text,t2_2bcyd83q,False,False,"&gt;On June 5, the public television channel France2 broadcast a report about the CAESAr [Trucks equipped with a 155 mm artillery system] recently delivered to Ukraine by France.  And, according to a Ukrainian officer, these systems are fully satisfactory, with at least 80 Russian artillery pieces said to have been destroyed since they entered action.  And this, thanks to their range of about 40 km, the speed of their battery life and their mobility, which makes it possible to avoid a return fire.

&gt; According to France2, the Ukrainian forces would have eighteen CAESAr in total.  However, during a hearing in the Senate in May, the Delegate General for Armaments [DGA], Joël Barre, had indicated that only six copies, taken from the Army's endowment, had been sent to Ukraine.  for the moment.

 &gt;During a trip to kyiv last week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Catherine Colonna, was hardly specific about the military aid provided by France to Ukraine.

 &gt;""The President of the Republic indicated to Mr. Zelenski [his Ukrainian counterpart, editor's note] that France would continue and strengthen its arms deliveries within the framework of a dialogue which, I will remind you, was old and which allowed everything to  both to assess Ukraine's needs and our ability to meet them.  This was quickly translated into action […] with the arrival of CAESAr.  Others are expected.  We don't usually talk about these issues openly in the public arena.  We are talking about it among friends, ""said Ms. Colonna, before assuring that we will be able to see new deliveries of weapons in the"" few weeks to come "".

 &gt;That said, and according to information from Europe1, six other CAESAr should soon take the direction of Ukraine, an official announcement probably to be made during a trip by Mr. Macron to kyiv.

 &gt;""He's welcome no matter when.  It would be good for Mr. Macron to come during the French presidency of the EU [Union européenne, ndlr], and the best would be for him to come with other arms deliveries for Ukraine, here is the most help  precious that we can receive from France, ""said Dmytro Kouleba, the head of Ukrainian diplomacy, on May 30.

&gt; As Mr. Barre had explained, the CAESArs intended for the Ukrainian forces are not exactly the same as those used by the Army which, if this new aid is confirmed, will only have 64 units [i.e.  capacity reduction of -16%].  In this regard, in an interview published by the regional press on June 4, Mr. Macron assured that ""these deliveries [to Ukraine] will be compensated"".  And to add: ""And I asked our industrialists to accelerate the production of armaments, it is not only a question of replenishing our stocks but also of strengthening our independence.  »

&gt; Anyway, before being sent to Ukraine, these CAESArs taken from the inventory of the Army must be adapted to the ""Ukrainian command systems"".  A job that was entrusted to Nexter, according to Mr. Barre.

&gt; Compared to the military aid provided by other countries [such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland or the Czech Republic], that of France is limited to ""small volumes"", underlines Europe1.  “The main reason, according to several military sources, is political resistance.  With this subject of weapons, Emmanuel Macron is advancing on a crest line.  On the one hand, he refuses to appear as belligerent in the eyes of the Russians.  On the other hand, he wants to show that France's role is not limited to humanitarian aid, the delivery of fire trucks or the dispatch of gendarmes to investigate war crimes,"" he says.  -she.",ff9c2f7f7a56c8b4853624fdd13f2e14518965e9,True,False,,,,,0,1654792168,,0,{},ibqyadj,True,t3_v8kp03,False,True,t3_v8kp03,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8kp03/artillery_france_could_soon_deliver_another_6/ibqyadj/,1654792185,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654763368.0,

1. There's a ton of special parts on the Leopard 2, that you don't find on a T-64.

Like the transmission, and gearbox which is a self contained unit.

2. The systems you mention arn't as complex, as a Leopard 2 tank.   
There's a massive difference between sending a self propelled gun based on a truck chassis, and a modern main battle tank.   


3. The Iranians kept the F-14 operational.   
Because they had been taught to do so, and had purchase a ton of spare parts, which was then cannibalized to make the rest operational.   
Iran was allied with the US before the coup in 1979.

I think many people fail to realize the importance of the events in Ukraine. This is the biggest crisis in decades and a lot hangs on how it ends. An outcome Putin can say that the invasion was a success, would be a major setback for the West with far-reaching consequences(can expand on that if anyone's interested). On the other hand, if that outcome can be avoided, and if NATO can significantly weaken one of its main opponents(and the reason NATO was created in the first place), that will be a success with also far-reaching (positive) consequences. I think around 1% of NATO countries' yearly GDP, in weapons and other assistance should be enough to accomplish that, which is a huge amount of money of course, but more than fair relative to the scale of the crisis.",cc8ee549be8dd0d3194587637fd3237b7b040c6f,True,False,,,,,0,1654791307,,0,{},ibqw88j,False,t3_v888al,False,True,t1_ibq0t9x,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v888al/the_mayor_of_kramatorsk_let_me_give_you_my/ibqw88j/,1654791326,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654762507.0,

-after the 2014 Maidan uprising, the legitimately-elected President was illegally deposed and replaced. In response, parts of the Donbas decided they were not on board with the replacement -- and seceded. Those parts of the Donbas have never been allowed to vote in any election since.

-The illegitimate Ukrainian gov't then sent in the army, and Russia decided to defend the Russians living there. This has what has led to the conflict -- and to the Ukrainians killing many ethnic Russians as a result.

-Also, the Ukrainian gov't was persecuting ethnic Russians in the Donbas, making it illegal to speak Russian or to learn it, destroying Russian culture, etc.

-Russia tried to make peace with Minsk agreements, but Zelensky wouldn't honor it, even after he said he would while campaigning.

1) Spain is sending 40 Leopards 2A4, not 10. That's a German lie.

2) The tanks were carefully stored and maintained at AALOG 41, an indoor installation designed just for that.  The whole 53 tanks stored are usable and have carefully maintained. They only need to be assembled and fluids pumped back in. Of those 53 Spain is going to retain 13 to be converted in Castor sapper vehicles. Another 54 are currently deployed in North Africa.

&amp;#x200B;

3) I've lived in both Spain and Germany and compared with Germany's bureaucracy, Spain is heaven, while Germany's bureaucracy is a rotten HELL. 6 years ago I could process things trough Spanish bureaucracy from my computer in Germany in minutes. In Germany, it took me weeks of queues and visits to offices to rude and bad behaved German civil servants.

They really don't - that's why they're pulling ancient T-62s out of storage for deployment and equipping DPR forces with even older mosin-nagant rifles.

Even if they started mass conscription tomorrow, by the time those conscripts arrived in combat Russia's equipment shortage would be *even worse* than it already is.

And how are they going to organize anything when their officer corps started out insufficient, is badly depleted from that state, and you're talking about increasing the amount of forces tenfold or more? Worse, they already don't have a real NCO corps. That kind of conscription might be sufficient if they were on the defense, but it's not going to be effective on the offense.

And it will only get worse when they can't supply those troops with food, let alone ammo, because their logistics simply aren't up to the task.

Don't get me wrong: there *are* risks, but they are primarily related to Ukraine's ability to reclaim territory and be prepared to resist future Russian aggression, and have very little to do with Russia mobilizing cannon fodder.

&gt; Aiden Aslin, 28, from Newark in Nottinghamshire, and Shaun Pinner, 48, from Bedfordshire, had been fighting in Ukraine when they were detained by Russian forces in April and held in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&amp;#039;s Republic, a breakaway region in Ukraine&amp;#039;s east.

Its pretty easy actually. From 1991 to 2001 the doctrine was to  disarm the german forces in accordance with the reunification treaty and the military budcet was drastically cut because if you make the army smaller you dont need new weapons anyway. You can just life from your now giant cold war stockpile. Then germany gave away the vast majority of its stockpiles to allies, eather selling them (basically every Leopard 2 outside of germany is former german army stockpile) or donating them (for example East German Migs to Poland for 1$ per plane, the ones Poland wanted to send to Ukraine in March). 
Then the big event happened: 9/11
Suddenly the german army, that is a solely continental force, gets dragged into afghanistan and is compleatly unprepared for that. A war on the other side of the planet was nothing anybody planned for so all new investmeanrs the last 20 years went into reequipping the german army to be able to sustain an expedition force on its own outside of europe. As a result the continental force was reduced ones more because what good are hu dreds of tanks and AA weapons if you fight terrorists? A small highly equipped and trained expedition force was bow the goal of the military doctrine. Then 2014 crimea annexation haopened and germany refocussed a bid more on the continental defense aspect (for example increasing the tank force from 200 to over 300 Leopard 2s). Most of these plans havent been finished yetbut the war in ukraine caught Germany basically compleatly  by suprise. Now we have stuff to fight in Mali or Afghanistan but our home defense is catastrophic.
Add to that the fact the military us not popular in germany and military budget often seen as a waste, the typical arms production scandals, delays, desasters, some political corruption (famously Van der Leyens councelor affair), the huge issue with militaty readiness of weapons (half our weapons are literally not fully operational richt now) and you have the current mess.

If Russia invaded Ukraine in 1991 Germany could have supplied Ukraine on its own with all the weapons in stock from the West and East German Armies, the strongest land armies of each military alliance during the cold war after the USA/USSR respectively. But sadly (or luckily) Russia didnt and now Germany is caught with its pants down.

Fun fact, Germany has to pay 20 billion alone to restock its ammo supply...that is nearly 50% of the regular militaty budget per year...yeah its that bad.
One general said germany could fight for about 2 weeks with a brigade or two until it runs out of ammo and has to throw stones...",6050af1e2faed3388a59d22d32a477fafec6207c,True,False,,,,,0,1654789281,,0,{},ibqresl,False,t3_v7xq95,False,True,t1_ibpt2t4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7xq95/spain_is_ready_to_take_out_of_storage_and_hand/ibqresl/,1654789297,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654760481.0,

Actually the support was overwhelming back then.

And talking about scientists and engineers, also from the field: By far most also were against having nuclear power for longer then.

The reasons - also the ones Merkel stated btw., where not fundamental technological, but that it is just impossible to have proper and safe commercial nuclear power. Why Fukushima was such a big shock just in that field, was not even that much the accident itself, but the terrible reaction to it - and the conclusion was - if the Japanese can't deal with it, we also couldn't.

Sure - another conclusion could have also been we renew nuclear power, but this time without any commercial interests. But there is close to zero support for that - people don't want expensive, clean, safe nuclear power, they want it cheap.

And it is our duty to honour their heroic deeds and the memory of the heroes.*  
  
*Therefore, we are proposing - and I am sure Kyiv City Council will ask the government - that a military cemetery be established in the capital for the honorary burial of the defenders of Ukraine.""*  
  
*Details: The city authorities are proposing that the cemetery be built near the Babyn Yar ravine.*  
  
*According to Klychko, Kyiv is prepared to cover all the costs associated with the construction of the military cemetery.*  
  
*""But we also need support at the national level in terms of supporting documentation, and perhaps even the adoption of a separate law on this issue. I am convinced that Kyiv should implement this project together with the government,"" Klychko concluded.*",51d2ea16bc7c4f2898abea3c001b0880b3b0e790,True,False,,,,,0,1654788575,,0,{},ibqpqov,True,t3_v8jd2c,False,True,t3_v8jd2c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8jd2c/mayor_klychko_wants_to_create_a_military_cemetery/ibqpqov/,1654788592,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654759775.0,

3097,[],False,,BlueNoobster,,,[],,,,text,t2_24x8g1ac,False,False,"Ah yes Polands claim is ""much more believable""

So why did the deal with Czechia for Leopard 2A4s work then?

Poland has been famous for inventing bullshit about germany since in 2015 tje PiS party took over. Bullshit like"" the EU beeing Germanys 4th Reich, Germany beeing in a culture war with Poland, Germany supressing a supposed polish minority in Germany"" (sounding similar to russia sometimes), Comparing German Leadwrs to Nazi Leaders in officially sponsored AD campaigns, the list goes on.

PiS party is as believable as the Kremlin. Especially because anti germany propaganda is one of their biggest selling points and guess what the next election in Poland isnt that far ahead.

Even the polish military was confused by supposed claims by Polands gouvernmeant demanding the most modern german tanks because it made no sense at all.

Just typical anti germany propaganda by PiS and then the usual ""we didnt mean it like that"" after the damage has been done and their goal achieved.

PiS is finally doing something good in years by supporting Ukraine and immediatly abuses it for doemestic propaganda and anti Germany hate.

Also, I know this is hard to u derstand for many, but GDP has 0 to do with how many weapons a country has that it can spare to giveto ukraine. Germany has 0 heavy vehicles in stockpile and every tank or gun has to be taken from the german armys active soldiers, literally disarming them. Meanwhile countries like Poland have stockpiles they can send  but so far no active polish soldier had to give up a single weapon.

And if you wonder where germanys stockpile went, it was sold or donated to NATO allies. Where do you think Poland got those Leopard 2s from or the upgraded Migs? Germany literally donated their Migs to Poland for 1$ per plane.

So maybe just return the stuff germany sold or donated to half the EU so that germany can donate them to ukraine and the complain why all its allies arent suddenly donating so much anymore.

If this was 1991 cermany could have armed ukraine alone so many weapons were in storage here but germany decided it would be better to give most of them away to its allies. A weapon in the hands of an allied soldier is better then one in a warehouse rotting away after all. The NATO allies got high quality stuff cheap as a result.

Im not denying germany underfunded its army to much, there is no doubt about that, but beeing accused by coubtries that literally got weapons from germany for free for not donating enough weapons to ukraine is insulting. And then there is the simple fact called reality. Germany has NATO obligations to meet and disarming the german army  as is demanded on this sub countless times is a direct violation of that. Germany can only send what it can spare and that is very little. And it takes significantly longer to take weapons away from active soldiers and military units then dusting them off from a polish warehouse.

The fact spain announced they could send 40 Leopard 2s to Ukraine and the later reduction to only 10 after months of repair should tell you enough that it isnt as easy as you might believe. Spoiler: Spain isnt Germany.

Also, countries with big gdps like the neatherlands, belgium, luxembourg or italy havent exactly send 200 tanks each eather yet because GDP doesnt mean military power. Every country should give what it can spare without weakening NATO. Do to military policies of the last 30 years this means some countries have more to send then others. In future this might change but now this is reality Building modern hightech weapons takes time (a Leopard 2 up to 3 years after beeing ordered for example) and no german manufacturer has 1000 heavy weapons in storage somewhere for WW3 because that is uneconomical and arms producers here are privat companys after all.

Germany is giving ukraine money because it cant deliver as much itself so ukraine can buy weapons from countries that have some to spare (for example the recent 600 millions arms deal between Poland and Ukraine). 

It isnt as one sided and one dimensional as you like to depict it. And I already know I will get downvoted because anti germany propaganda has been indoctrinated in poles by PiS for years now sadly and if we learned anytji g from WW2 then that it only takes a few years of that to turn neighbours against each other.",3f8ce8621c984ceeb254020f9bbb3a89147a79eb,True,False,,,,,0,1654788211,,0,{},ibqovi2,False,t3_v8fmux,False,True,t1_ibqggqm,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8fmux/duda_poland_has_sent_more_than_240_tanks_about/ibqovi2/,1654788222,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654759411.0,

You are claiming that's Regans 90s era policies worked because we are inflicting pain on Russia with sanctions. But this is just one of many possible explanations, and not on its surface the most lilely one.

For example, if the administration's of the 90s would have required anti-corruption policies to be put in place PRIOR to inclusion into Western financial system, the rich oligarchs and their spy leader never have had the influence &amp; corrupt cash that is required to mount such destabilizing offenses. This is a very real possibility. Which means it's quite possible that appeasing and enriching a dictator contributed to the war. In this context, it's impossible to describe ""the effect of sanctions"" as a a good outcome. I mean, just say it outbound to hear my point: ""Your policy contributed to the likelihood of a conflict by empowering a communist dictator, but the policy is successful because it allowed for sanctions during said conflict""

Do you think there is a factory in Germany that just spits out tanks by the hundreds each month?

Germany has no stockpile of modern tanks that it can draw down units from. The thousands of Cold War era tanks were almost all sold off to other countries (including Poland), and Germany itself only maintains less than 300, with a questionable state of readiness.

*****
&gt; A court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner after a days-long process that observers have called a &amp;quot;Show trial&amp;quot; on &amp;quot;Trumped-up charges&amp;quot; meant to imitate war crimes trials against Russian soldiers in Kyiv.Aslin, 28, from Newark, and Pinner, 48, from Watford, were convicted by the court in Russian-controlled territory in Donetsk alongside Saaudun Brahim on charges of &amp;quot;Terrorism&amp;quot;.

&gt; Russia is believed to be using the process in part to put pressure on the UK and may seek a prisoner exchange for Russian soldiers convicted of murder and other war crimes during Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine.

&gt; Ukraine has sentenced three Russian soldiers to prison for war crimes tied to the Russian offensive that began on 24 February.

While Russia may seems like irrational, they certainly are not. They have planned this for a long time. All the propaganda for years for domestic audience. Counter sanctions from 2014 forced Russia to be self sufficient for basic needs. They do not run out of food or energy. They might have to wipe asses with leafs and they will not have hi-tech but unfortunately they can continue wiping asses with leafs for very long time. Much longer than Europeans can be without heating and electricity during winter or much longer that Africa and Middle-East can stay hungry. When we are in the situation where we have no option but to enter Russian soil to open the gas valves or food silos, we are in the nuclear war scenario. We can beat them in Ukraine but we cant beat them in Russian soil.

They did some major miscalculations. They overestimated own capabilities and underestimated Ukraine's capability. They really though they would be so much more superior that it would be over in matter of hours or days. Hence they had the parade suits and riot police gear with them. They thought that west would repeat the 2014. They were not prepared for the unity of west, how fast sanctions were dropped and how fast help was delivered to Ukraine.

&amp;#x200B;

In Russia, its ok to be beaten up but you can not pussy out. This is why we are now stuck with the war. Putin will continue until he has nothing left, he will not pussy out.

The “Supreme Court” of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (“DPR”) sentenced three foreigners to death in a case of participation in hostilities on the side of Ukraine. It is reported by RBC.

The verdict was handed down to two British citizens Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin, as well as a Moroccan citizen Saadoun Brahim.

The men were charged with mercenarism (Art. 440 of the DPR Criminal Code) and forcible seizure of power by a group of persons (Part 2, Article 34; Art. 323 of the DPR Criminal Code). The last article provides for the death penalty, taking into account the fact that the crime was allegedly committed in wartime. Hearings began on June 7th. Aiden Aslin began serving in the 36th Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine back in 2018, Mediazona noted . He came to Ukraine because of the bride. In captivity, judging by the records on his Twitter, the man was in mid-April. At the same time, his friend, 48-year-old ex-military of the Royal English Regiment, Sean Pinner from the same brigade, ended up in the “DPR”. Pinner's relatives noted that both he and Aslin officially served in the Ukrainian army in accordance with the law - because of this, they are not mercenaries.

Brahim Saadoun is 21 years old. He came to Ukraine in 2019, studied at the Faculty of Aerodynamic and Space Technologies of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. A year ago, he dropped out of school and went to serve on a contract basis in the same 36th separate marine brigade. He was taken prisoner by the “DPR” fighters during the fighting in Volnovakha.",0b8fa63e85a4f62c10cf4041c3d7f3a15b0f78a8,True,False,,,,,0,1654785089,,0,{},ibqho2s,True,t3_v8i3w5,False,True,t3_v8i3w5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8i3w5/three_foreigners_were_sentenced_to_death_two/ibqho2s/,1654785104,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654756289.0,

The Polish president has denied asking for leopards 2A7. His claim is more believable than that of German side considering that Poland doesn't use 2A7 tanks, nor has an intention of buying them in the next-gen tank programme. Instead we currently use the a5 and a4 variants, which we are in the process of modernizing to our own standard using our own industry. Therefore, its most unlikely tank Poland rejects receiving deliveries of A4 tanks and instead demands to be given the production run of 2A7s for German military. What further proves that point is the fact that our government asked the Swiss to donate to us their stockpile of 2a4 tanks.

Nevertheless, the facts are that Poland has donated hundreds of tanks, APCs and howitzers while the number of heavy equipment donated by Germany (which has nominal GDP 5 times greater than Poland) remains at zero.",e0547b4d972ea203023eddc7429ccb6169aa29ca,True,False,,,,,0,1654784543,,0,{},ibqggqm,False,t3_v8fmux,False,True,t1_ibqcajw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8fmux/duda_poland_has_sent_more_than_240_tanks_about/ibqggqm/,1654784561,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654755743.0,

No, when it's a noun, it's a noun. But while you can use ""jet"" as a noun in colloquial speech, you should not do so if you want to be precise in your terminology.

That's why you can talk about ""fighter jets"" in mainstream media, but a professional author in professional literature ought to never say so, and instead use ""jet fighter.""

What you say in your second paragraph is a non sequitur. You could just as well argue that ""jet"" is ambiguous, since in might mean a jet of water.

""I was asked what I thought about the fact that the Germans did not deliver the promised tanks. It is incorrect to say that we were expecting the most modern weapons, the Leopard II tanks. This is not true"" - emphasizes Duda. “It is natural for us that for the old Soviet tanks that we have delivered to Ukraine 240, we will get a few Leopard tanks from Germany, not the most modern ones. A version of the Leopard tanks. We could take over the older ones, modernized them in the future - also with the help of German technologies.

Not with Poland. They are just using it as propaganda against the EU. They along with Hungary also veto any sanctions against each other so the EU is kind of helpless. Poland and Hungary are best buds in the EU. And the reasons Hungary has not been sanctioned is because of Poland. Something to keep in mind when thinking about the war in Ukraine and Polands and Hungary reaction to that.

Plus with Poland it is not ""just"" how they violate democratic principles (though violating democratic principles is probably the worst you can do short of killing people) they also have in place an abortion ban that is so severe to the point doctors were too afraid to perform a medically needed procedure that would come close to an abortion under this law so they did nothing out of fear.

[Here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/state-of-democracy-world-2022-1.jpg)'s how bad it looks.

It's not Poland Hans, Poland became a [liberal and democratic](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/poland-europes-forgotten-democratic-ancestor-16073) country literal ages before anyone else in Europe even thought it may be a good idea, it cherished that democracy both before and after it got ganked by their shitty, non-democratic neighbours time after time - and it prevailed, as a democratic country that, in the end, fought off the communism.

You have some objections to the current polish gov, you're very welcome to do so, they deserve a lot of it. In fact everyone on reddit seems to wear that despise for PiS as a badge of honor, and it changes absolutely nothing, since it's the polish people who will ultimately vote and decide on whatever they like.

Thou of course it's not like you give a shit about the ""state of principles"" you don't know the meaning of, or Poland in general, jokes aside. It's not like you're gonna ever visit Poland or have anything to do with Poland except for shitposting on the internet, but of course you are more agitated and absorbed by some empty slogans than most people who in fact live in that country - except maybe for KOD activists who only made fools of themselves and lost the entire ""initial"" marginal support they had in 2015.

1) russia won't give Up its nuclear Arsenal, because it is their life insurance. Neither would any other nuclear power in the world (Ukraine after the Fall of soviet union is a very Special Case). Without nuclear weapons, russia would be bullied by China, the US, France, UK etc. Those weapons are the guarantee that even with inferior economical might they will sit at the big Boy table and are to a degree untouchable. 

2) reparations and prosecution of russian officials: unlikely. Russia gives 0 fucks about den Hague (as does China or the US btw). The Western playbook is reaching the end (Last straw being Gas), afterwards there is no Tool left to hurt russia other than war. So why would russia pay reparations or send russians (Not those that are getting captured in Ukraine) for trials. The Situation won't become worse by much. And to give in to those demands, russia would ask for at least smth that offsets it (No sanctions for example).

About the 2nd Part: disembling nations has worked greatly in the past (Iraq caused ISIS), Afghanistan is still Not a stable country anyone in the west wants to deal with etc. Apart from being very unlikely to happen (internal threats are getting dealt with and external threats can be kept in check via nuclear weapons), it is a nice utopian Idea that all those different regions are only surpressed by moscow and arent brainwashed into some kind of believe of russian superiority and the good old soviet days. Those Basic ideologies tend to stay for quite a while (lets compare it to US weapon law, Germanys Peace through trade, UKs Britannica Rules the waves etc). Those ideas stay even If getting proven wrong on a daily Basis, because they are the core of the identy. 

The Last Part: what to say. I agree.

3825,[],False,,chaos0xomega,,,[],,,,text,t2_qu9qm,False,False,"I can't tell if you're a concern troll or just wholly unfamiliar/clueless on the subject matter.

Ukraines weapons industry was mostly centered around Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Mariupol and the eastern part of the country, Russia destroyed most of those plants and factories early in the war. The production plants in other parts of the country like Lviv, Odessa, Dnipro, etc. were similarly targeted by long range missile strikes very early in the war and are operating at severely reduced capacity or have been entirely destroyed as well. 

There is no ""rapidly expand and start making tons of weapons as fast as possible"". Modern weapon system manufacturing is highly technical and highly skilled work and requires specialized facilities and equipment for many of the processes involved with doing so. It also takes a lot of time. With the existing facilities mostly destroyed and many of the trained manufacturing personnel dead, captured, or scattered, its not like you can just set up in a new building on the opposite side of the country and get back online in a few days. Setting up the building infrastructure with the necessary power distribution, pneumatic systems, inert gasses, process fluids, cryogenic systems, HVAC and environmental controls, etc. is something that takes months to do when there isn't a war going on, it gets a good bit harder when you're doing it under regular bombardment and are in the middle of one of the worst supply chain crises in human history. Even if they had a facility magically ready to go with the necessary infrastructure in all the right places, etc, acquiring the production equipment and tooling needed to manufacture the components of modern weapon systems (tanks, aircraft, artillery pieces, ammunition, missiles, drones, etc) takes months or even years. 

None of that equipment and tooling is something that exists on a shelf somewhere, all of that equipment is basically custom-built to order, a process that could take 6-18 months on average pre-pandemic, depending on what type of hardware you were buying, but now can have lead times double or even triple that. And then once you get it you have to calibrate and prove it (which itself could take months) and train personnel to operate it before you can even turn it over to production.

Even once the facility and equipment is into production, making modern weapons is a phenomenally time intensive process. The US for example only averages between 20-60 Abrams tanks built per year, with the ability to (over seceral years) surge production capacity to about 30 per month (360 per year) - in a much larger country than Ukraine with a much larger industrial capacity amd with existing facilities and personnel to do so. Likewise the US (and its allies) can only manage to turn out a peak of about 150 F-35s a year with its existing infrastructure, last year they delivered 140, and the year before that 120. Many of those tanks and planes are built over an extended period with lead times of months or years - it takes about 5 months to build a single Abrams for example, and about 22 months to build an F-35. Certain pieces of specialized hardware (counterbattery radars, jamming pods, etc) can similarly take 12-18 months or more to deliver.

Even before the war Ukraines industrial capacity just wasn't there. They were able to manufacture only about 14,000 artillery shells per year as of 2018 when they set up a new 152mm ammunition factory in kharkiv, for example, and only about 5-10 tanks per month (actually refurbishing them from storage, which effectively entailed an almost complete disassessembly and rebuild with brand new donestically built parts of 80-90% of the vehicle) using the lviv armored plant. Building entirely new tanks wasn't possible because Ukraine doesn't have the capability to manufacture certain components which they could only get from Russia, and they similarly lacked the ability to design, develop, and manufacture certain critical complnents that would be needed to design their own domestic designs. 

These numbers would be wholly insifficient to even come close to replacing ukrainian losses/usage, let alone allow them to build up. Now that those facilities are mostly damaged or destroyed, its just not going to happen any faster than that, if at all.",d661462807d37a935901a87f72d2ae91e1e48639,True,False,,,,,0,1654781485,,0,{},ibqa1h2,False,t3_v8erw4,False,True,t1_ibq378u,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8erw4/six_new_caesar_leave_france/ibqa1h2/,1654781502,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654752685.0,

I'm not convinced.

Imagine they went for the Baltics. It would take them only a couple of days to occupy the whole countries and start erasing cities.

To be fair, after the annexation of Crimera, I think they sincerely didn't want a further partition of Ukraine, right up until this year.

Since the Maidan, Russia's aims for Ukraine were to keep Ukraine from pivoting further away from Russia towards NATO and to keep Ukraine from joining NATO at all costs. To this end, Donetsk and Luhansk are probably more valuable to Russia as part of Ukraine, as pro-Russian counterweight to the extremely anti-Russian western Ukraine. This is why the Russian position throughout the Minsk negotiations was to keep Donbas in Ukraine alongside constitutional reform to give the region more autonomy. They actually butted heads with the separatist republics over this - the DPR believe that they could have retaken Mariupol in 2015 when the Ukrainian army was in retreat had Russia not held them back.

The pivot in Russian policy away from using pro-Russian regions of Ukraine as proxies within Ukrainian politics to outright portioning Ukraine and annexing those regions has only come after it has become apparent that neither the Ukrainian government nor the Donbas republics were prepared to compromise enough to end the Donbas war.",ebd37b925fb8f81adbcc4e64539042ce6e5932c6,True,False,,,,,0,1654780931,,0,{},ibq8xt8,False,t3_v8gc8w,False,True,t3_v8gc8w,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8gc8w/many_people_urge_until_now_for_a_deal_with_putin/ibq8xt8/,1654780946,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654752131.0,

I do see however how you conveniently glanced over the fact that the missiles used in the US M270 and the DE-IT-FR-developed MARS II ammunitions are NOT all compatible - and this IS precisely the tropic at hand.

What you, or I for that matter, expect DE to deliver immediately – in terms of SPHs or otherwise – is irrelevant because we do NOT know why most the darn things are out of service and/or how fast they could be repaired. Does the Bundeswehr not have enough trained technicians? Are there not enough spare parts? What kind of parts are they missing? How fast could they be procured?

**The point being: Nobody outside the German government/defense ministry has the actual facts, which makes all this bullshit internet-griping utterly pointless.**

*“Ship 20 and fix 50 immediately”*?? No country on this planet is going to give up 50% of its heavy artillery, and expecting otherwise is not only disingenuous, it borders on ludicrous. As for fixing the broken crap “immediately”, see above re: where are the parts supposed to come from “immediately” if they’re not already sitting around in some warehouse?

I am neither looking to misrepresent what you said, or to pick a fight. I am simply fed up with most of the idiots (≠ you) in this sub frothing at the mouth about situations they have zero fucking facts on. All of it is pointless supposition.

It's not your problem, and it's not up to you to decide if we can afford such a risk. All the talks about escalation, especially on behalf of Ukraine are nothing but attempts to hide the real reasons.

&gt; ...the idea that sending Ukraine NATO aircraft is going to make Russia surrender...

This is purely your idea. My idea is that it will make them die faster and in greater numbers. And it will allow destroying their expensive machinery. That's the point of conventional weapons, not ""political pressure"".

I think energy solutions need to be more nuanced then simply nuclear. BC and Quebec are almost solely supplied by hydro electric and have little use for nuclear. With the potential for earthquakes on the west coast I'd never support nuclear. A switch to oil and gas from coal decreases CO2 emissions and can be used to transition as has happened in the US and Alberta. There should be follow through to more green sources eventually.

https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/05/24/poland-accuses-germany-of-reneging-on-promise-to-provide-tanks-to-replace-those-given-to-ukraine/

Polish President Andrzej Duda has accused Germany of reneging on a promise to provide tanks to replace those that Poland gave to Ukraine to support its defence against Russia.

“We handed over tanks to Ukraine, a very large number of them, to provide urgent help,” said Duda, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

“If we were supported by our allies from Germany with a batch of tanks to replace the ones we gave to Ukraine, we would be very grateful,” he continued. “We had such a promise, [but now] we hear that Germany will not want to fulfil this promise. It is a big disappointment for us.”

Do your research

&gt; Germany has donated Jack shit that we can see to Ukraine

Another lie, not even gonna bother

&gt; , or those Gepards… or any word on those Leo’s and Marders, hell even Greece is now getting screwed by Germany on wanting to give up their Soviet era stuff in exchange.

Holy shit, you are the worst kind of troll.

The Leos were never supposed to go to Ukraine because they don't have the supply lines to maintain them. And the Marders take time to fix but nobody listended when Rheinmetall said they could offer them. It was always more than 12 months to get more than 50% of them ready and that is a industry estimate to sell stuff (at 70% more than usual) so most likely it takes even more time.

Greece is not getting screwed, they refuse to give away their stuff until they get replacements. Germany does not have replacements for all of Europe. We are replacing stuff for 9 countries right now and for free. 

&gt; because of outdated programming? 

You are surprised a German weapon can only fire German ammunition by default? While things are good with the UK and US you really don't want your military equipment easily being used by foreign powers my friend.

NATO fighters and bombers are designed to work with NATO comms and intelligence, and with protective measures which Ukraine does not have, and which have to be manufactured and shipped to Ukraine. Unless Ukrainian pilots have eyes able to see around the curvature of the earth, these aircraft will not be of much use to you. If even an older NATO plane is downed and captured, then all the tech will now be known to the enemy, and that is bad news for everyone. Granted, right now it would be darn hard for Russia to build a replica due to sanctions, but that is not the main problem here.

If Russia decides that NATO is directly involved in Ukraine, Russia knows that it will not be able to counter by invading a NATO country. Russia already shells civilian targets all over Ukraine, leveling cities, killing civvies indiscriminately. Russia would have little to lose at that point from nuking Kyiv, for starters, to deter further action, like the US did to Japan in August, 1945. If that happens, NATO is not going to respond in kind and the rest of the world will flee from being associated with Ukraine. Russia will still lose, eventually, but the cost will be so much higher for Ukraine than now.

Blame the West and that is fine, and probably justified to a considerable degree, but the idea that sending Ukraine NATO aircraft is going to make Russia surrender is not likely, sadly, and probably will result in weapons of mass destruction being unleashed on Ukraine, and then no country is going to do anything more and risk being the next target.

The US is not going to let Ukraine lose because a protracted war in Ukraine is the best means to destroy Russia. Sounds cold and calculating because it is and I hate, hate, hate it.

As for ""never again,"" where were we all when the Rwandan Genocide went down? Remember that one? Conservative 500,000 civilian Tutsi slaughtered with clubs and knives. Real psychopaths. Before my time was the Cambodian genocide. 1.5 to 2 MILLION. No one did jack. On the contrary, Ukraine has the focus of billions of people in the free world, which has the money and the resources and is doing what it can, and they get criticized by their own citizens when they dawdle. At lot of Germans do not like the shit the German government is pulling. There are ex-US military with hard-ons bigger than Burj Dubai who want to turn Russia inside-out and some of them are probably camped out in the White House, chugging Red Bull and dreaming up ways to kill Moscow so it will not grow back, others of them are fighting in Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, the Tutsi and the Cambodians got some documentaries after the fact and some museums where relatively few foreign tourists go to see the cairns of skulls.

Barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way forward is the grind. We are all grinding what we can.

It's a very different situation. First, because it takes ages to build a tank or any heavy weaponry (I think I read somewhere that it's around 5 months for an Abrams from start to finish for example, will be similar for others) and the western stuff is already manufactured. WW2 lasted for 6 years, this war has been going on for just over 3 months at this point. Also, there is a war on, logistics are complicated and I'd imagine Russia would prioritize those facilities as targets, pretty much all of Ukraine is within range of Russian weapons. In WW2 the war manufacturing was mostly done far away from the frontlines, either in the US, Siberia, the German heartland, or like Scotland, not exactly within artillery range to the enemy. Also, almost all of their preexisting weapons manufacturing plants are very near the frontlines even within Ukraine. Tanks and IFVs are manufactured in Kharkiv, their main shipyards are in Mikolaiv, some facilities of the Antonov factory near Kyiv were the location of some of the fiercest fighting of the early war.

Czechia is willing to give up 20 Frontline T72’s in exchange for 20 Leopard 2’s via the ringtausch deal with Germany.

Earlier in the war Bulgaria gave up its S300 air defense system in exchange for US Patriot systems…

Bulgaria gave up 25 Russian ground attack SU25’s recently in exchange for something yet to be agreed on.

And lastly Poland agreed to cover air space over countries like Romania while one of their nations gave Ukraine their air craft in exchange for American F16’s… 

No one is willing giving up their stuff without a kick back.

&gt;The US had stayed somewhat neutral up until that point selling armaments to the UK and others but pretty much stayed out to the war until that point.

The lend-lease act was enacted in March of 1941, which is months before pearl-harbor at a point where the US was not at all threatened by any of the Axis powers. An equivalent of $690bn of 2020 dollars was donated in equipment across allied powers with hardly any of it being repaid after. The significance of assistance for the survival of the UK and USSR is somewhat comperable, except the scale was far greater to the donations of Anti-tank and anti-air missiles for Ukraine currently.

Therefore, the actual actions taken by the US are by no means actions of a neutral nations. If you look at their politics - yeah officially they were keeping the sharade of isolationism, which by the way was a result of the losses that they took after they were asked to aid France and UK during WW1. However, the head of the nation was clearly determined to provide support to their European allies, and eventually this became the prevailing sentiment in the society and congress since lend-lease was eventually passed.

The claim that the official declaration of war by Germany after pearl-harbor was in any way a factor for the US involvement in the European theatre is just bizzare. Germany at no point was in any way a threat to US, only to their shipping lanes which were used to support the Allies.

The US could without a problem beat Japan in the pacific, stop their shipments of weapons to Europe and then save the lives of their soldier and sign peace with Third Reich who at that point would have zero incentive to continue on with being officially at war with them.

In summary, the US's involvement in the European theatre of WW2 was without a doubt a decision guided by moral considerations, and to assist their allies as the Third Reich did not pose any threat to security of the US, thus they would save more of their own lives if they decided not to engage them.",dbc2eb9ec7058bb5045cab52bb2b73e706f2b957,True,False,,,,,0,1654778485,,0,{},ibq4e6o,False,t3_v7xq95,False,True,t1_ibpxexw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7xq95/spain_is_ready_to_take_out_of_storage_and_hand/ibq4e6o/,1654778500,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654749685.0,

In the grand scheme of things Ukraine has not received that much western artillery, a couple hundred pieces at most, with at most another couple hundred pieces pledged and awaiting delivery. 

These pieces are not ""in addition to"" Ukraines existing artillery systems, they are ""instead of"". Ukraine had a shortage of 152mm ammo used by most of its artillery systems going into the war, the major suppliers of that ammo type are Russia and Ukraine, and most of Ukraines manufacturing capacity for 152mm rounds was located in Kharkiv (even then they could only produce about 14k rounds per year) - those factories are gone (purposefully destroyed by Russia) and Russia isn't going to be delivering more rounds to them anytime soon (at least not intentionally). The manufacturing capacity for 152mm rounds in other pro-Ukraine and western aligned nations willing to sell or transfer to Ukraine is limited to non-existent, and most of the existing 152 ammunition inventories in these states have already been depleted by donation and sales to Ukraine in support of the conflict. Even China doesn't really use 152mm, they mostly use 122 or 155 with limited 152 stocks in reserve and for training.

All of that is to say that Ukraine is basically retiring their existing artillery systems to switch over to western 155 systems, in the process that extends the life of their 152 munitions stocks because fewer systems are firing them and allows them to consolidate remaining 152 ammo across a smaller number of artillery pieces. But even still there have even been loose and scattered reports that Ukraine has effectively been rationing 152mm ammo and limiting the number of rounds fired in order to preserve availability of fire support etc, which means Russia not only has a substantial numerical advantage in terms of the number of artillery pieces being fielded (Russia has several thousand artillery pieces in theater, and tens of thousands more in reserve and storage), but also the effectiveness/efficiency of that artillery given that they are able to fire continuously whereas Ukraine might only be able to fire a few salvos per day.

its not a good situation for Umraine and they need a lot more artillery - especially 155mm pieces (those 152 Danas from Czechia were a nice gesture but will have a limited impact) than what they have been supplied with in order to compete.",b799b251cf2371a50b3d73e4cee0cb2477a6e233,True,False,,,,,0,1654778115,,0,{},ibq3r0j,False,t3_v8cfre,False,True,t1_ibpmr7b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8cfre/intelligence_report_paints_bleak_picture_of/ibq3r0j/,1654778128,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654749315.0,

I didn't mention article 5 once. You are seriously misrepresenting me. Even it it's name, article 5 implies that there are at lest four more articles and in fact NATO is massively more than four more articles.

Most of the act of joining NATO is conversion of training and systems to be at least in part NATO compatible.

&gt;. Poland’s own T-72M1 (125mm gun) and its own Leopard 2A4/A5s (120mm).

The 125mm standard is not NATO standard - it's a Warsaw Pact standard that Poland has from before it joined NATO.  The Leopard, on the other hand, *is* compatible with Frances LeClerk and Americas Abrams. Also even with Korea's K2. In other words you picked the deceptive exception and ignored the massive widespread compatibility. In fact 120mm is on every modern NATO battle system except for the UK's Challenger which uses an older rifled standard.

    108 Panzerhaubitze 2000s, only 40 of which are actually operational.

&gt;“Just 30” PzH2000s? Do you honestly expect any country on this planet to give up 75% of its SPHs and ship them to another country?

No, I expect shipping e.g. 20 now and immediately taking 50 of the out of service guns and putting them into service as soon as possible at absolutely any expense. At the same time I'd ship at least five out of service ones to Ukraine for use as spare parts and for training on maintaining the systems.

Those guns that are delivered now will find the Russians at a moment when the difference is critical and will contribute more to Germany's defense than double the number of guns in a years time if Russia defeats Ukraine and continues on into central Europe as they have been promising.

More importantly here, the primary reason for Germany to need these weapons is to defend against Russian attacks. Russian gun crews that are killed by effective counter-battery fire can no longer threaten Germany and so don't need to be defended against. On the other hand, those that survive will be able to train future gun crews which Germany, if it stands by it's Article 4 obligations, is likely to have to fight against later if Ukraine is defeated.

A comment here. For Ukraine, a PzH2000 is a game changer which gives them far more accurate range than their existing systems. For Germany it's a relatively minor weapon system which is massively outdistanced e.g. by German cruise missiles.

&gt;where are these “match Poland’s” deliveries supposed to come from?

Germany should explicitly allow it's arms manufacturers to deliver what they can as fast as they can. If they fail, then fine, if there are political limits then that's not acceptable. Particularly blockage of light tanks / IFVs isn't good.

&gt;people, in Germany and abroad, love to (falsely) blame the more liberal SPD for that – \[not the\] conservative CDU with Angela Merkel at the helm, not the SPD.)

Can I blame both? Merkel was clearly taken in by Putin. Schroeder was practically a Russian agent.

Thank you for your sympathy, but then you go into this delusional bullshit.

If by ""lose"" you mean ""Russia will not take Kyiv"", then, yes, as it stands right now, probably not.   But as it stands right now - the most likely course of events have russia controlling the bulk of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhe, and Kherson oblasts for the indefinite future, to say nothing of Crimea.

""We're all doing what we can.""""

But that's simply. not.  true.  And that attitude is exactly the problem.

Ukraine has maybe this summer before economic reality makes further substantial offensive military action extremely unlikely.  As it stands, further offensive action outside of right bank kherson oblast is already quite doubtful.  This is the likely actual timeline that Ukraine has to recover its territory or at least to signal that it is capable of a credible counteroffensive.    This requires more weapons NOW, not ""we're doing all we can.""  Ukrainian frontline soldiers, especially groups that would not normally be on frontlines but actually are, need weapons and equipment that are plentiful and could literally be in Ukraine, on the front line, in 24-48h if there was the political will to do this.

There is currently not.

First they got tens of thousends anti tank manpands and several thousends anti-air manpads.

But Ukraine have their own weapon manufacturing facilities. Why not just expand and start building a lot of their own weapons as fast as possible and at the same time put orders on what equipement they want to buy from other countries? All that besides weapons they get from so many countries. 

What's the problem? Why don't they just move to war production like countries did in WW2? 

They have a lot of people. They have 80% of their country still in control and they can still get a lot of supplies and help from the west.

At this point they should have mobilized everybody and train hundereds of thousends soldiers and building new tanks and vehicles ten times faster than before the war.

Agitate with Western democracies whose people are facing high inflation, and in the case of the US, a slow, simmering labor revolt, people who already complain that far too much money is spent in the US on the military, including Ukraine, money which could be spent on alleviating the crushing economic conditions, and in a country which is about to make it possible to outlaw abortion, and is suffering from the deaths of school children and a police force which did not help them and it goes on and on. The German government may or may not have equipment for Ukraine depending on how much corruption there has been. France is in the middle of a silly season which drags on until later in June. Alexander Johnson, the PM of England, whom the Ukrainian government likes, is ripping the UK apart, who could not care less about anyone but number one. Maybe in Belize things are quiet enough for anyone to hear above the roar of epochal turmoil.

How is anyone supposed to agitate for anything, when everyone is already pretty agitated? The fact is, the US is not going to let Ukraine lose and all they will regain their territory and Russia will be wrecked. This is not ""copamine,"" it is the permanent position of US policy now, irregardless as to whether Casper the Friendly Ghost becomes President for Life on Pennsylvania Ave. The problem is, Russia can launch a nuke anywhere it likes and even if it explodes in the middle of the Indian Ocean that will be the end of all the blue cheer Ukraine has garnered from the rest of the world.

So someone will have to play the middleman. Obviously countries with ties to russia (historically or economically) like Germany France Turkey China or India are those who might have a better Chance working as a middleman than countries that serve as russia antagonists like the US.

2) Regarding russias breakdown: If russia would be existencially threatened, they would use the nukes. So would any other nuclear armed country. There is simply no consens for russia to use nuclear weapons as an offensive Tool, since it would mean destruction to itself. If you are gonna get destroyed anyways, that barrier falls. State Propaganda is strong in russia and the oppression of the opposition has worked quite Well for a while. There is no reason to believe that will change soon.

3) You think Putin is the Problem? He is not. He is a result of the russian society, a structural issue. The President after Putin very likely follows a similar worldview. You simply dont change cultural ideas that easy. Take a look at the conflicts of the last 30 years. In which conflict did a cultural change happen?

About the last Part: what makes you think that? I think i made my causal chain pretty clear. If you need further explanation on certain parts, feel free to adress those and i'll try to explain my thought process more detailed.

About being unethical: Pragmatic maybe. I understand that many people have a glorified Idea on what is happening in Ukraine (i am Not Sure If you have been there in the Last 2 months, cause i have). We are Not talking about If Ukraine can win this conflict and what the borders will look Like. This is a discussion about the war ending at some Point in the future and there will be a need to have some kind of treaty (ceasefire, Peace treaty, whatever).

Poland has poured the lion's share of its hardware into Ukraine, as have many other Eastern states.  The UK has also shipped quite a bit of materiel and a great deal of technology to Ukraine.

We're getting to the point where the West may or may not be able to spare many more weapons.  And it's down to Ukraine to make what we're giving them count.  We can't magically make the Ukrainians not be outnumbered in terms of raw gear, it's simply going to take time to grind down the Russian material advantage.

I predict an 8-10 month gap where Ukraine starts getting less than they need because most of their Western friends don't have much more to spare.  The US can't give away a majority of its best guns with China licking its chops at Taiwan, we might need them and most of Eastern europe is sacrificing what it is on the theory that the US can protect them, so again, we need our arsenal.

Maybe he should request export permission then - if he found ammunition by now. The fun detail about the Leopard 1 Rheinmetall somehow always forgets to mention is, that there's no ammunition available that can be provided and none of the countries that do have it available aren't willing to share it:

[The depots of the German armed forces are empty, and German industry is also said to have hardly any significant quantities in stock, several high-ranking sources in the German government confirm to us. They are also unanimous in criticizing NATO allies such as Turkey, Greece and Belgium, as well as various other countries such as Brazil and Israel, for having declined to buy ammunition at the government level, claiming that no ammunition is in stock.

But I'm sure Rheinmetall considered that and sourced them themselves, right? 

[It is noteworthy that, according to Business Insider, the German government has not yet received any applications for the sale or resale of 105mm ammunition to Ukraine. Arms exports must be approved by the German government. However, internal government sources are signaling that such applications would have a good chance of being approved. ""We welcome when industry looks for ways to make the ring exchange effective in favor of Ukraine - and that includes the issue of ammunition,"" a senior official in the Ministry of Economy tells Business Insider.

Just. No. [Article 5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm), which you’re sort of quoting there, has nothing to do with and says nothing at all about supply line compatibility. More complex ammunitions (e.g. for MBTs or MLRSs) are decidedly *not* always interchangeable between systems used, e.g. Poland’s own T-72M1 (125mm gun) and its own Leopard 2A4/A5s (120mm). And while Germany’s MARS II is indeed based on the US-made M270, they are [NOT identical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System#MLRS_rockets_and_missiles). See “Variants” at the previous link, it specifically mentions that the German-Italian-French-developed MARS II is NOT compatible with many US munitions (M26, M26A1 and M30).

Yes, in an ideal world all the munitions and weapons systems within NATO would/should be interchangeable, but that is simply not the case today.

&gt;	At one end you can take a bullet from any NATO country and put it in a gun from any other over the whole range of ammo. At the other end, you can take an AWACS from any NATO county and use it to command and send direct battlefield information to a fighter plane from any other NATO country.

Bullets ≠ missiles, as simple as that. See above for details. [AWACS](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48904.htm) is completely different since the technology was specifically developed for NATO.

&gt;	This type of story would be quite easy to dispel. Make sure that there are large numbers of German heavy weapons, even if it was just 30 PzH2000s, in Ukraine, working and shooting. Germany should be able to match the other countries such as Poland. Once there is more German armor in Ukraine than Polish then we won’t worry about details of some part or another being delayed.

And where precisely are these German “heavy weapons” supposed to come from? Currently, Germany has:

-	108 Panzerhaubitze 2000s, [only 40](https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article238583365/Lambrecht-bestaetigt-Lieferung-von-sieben-Panzerhaubitzen-an-Ukraine.html) of which are actually operational.
-	[41 MARS II systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M270_Multiple_Launch_Rocket_System#Current_operators) (some of which are of course broken)

*“Just 30”* PzH2000s? Do you honestly expect any country on this planet to give up 75% of its SPHs and ship them to another country?

As far as MBTs are concerned, and since you specifically mention Poland… Poland currently has 871 of those in service, and Germany 245 ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_main_battle_tanks_by_country)), where are these *“match Poland’s”* deliveries supposed to come from?
 
Yes, I agree that Germany has suffered from a specific and severe case of neglect of its armed forces, primarily to save money (*), and a certain level of naïveté, due to its military history - that much is understood.

And it was also high time that they woke up and got with the program - that is also a given at this point.

But regardless of how rich a country is, you simply can’t whip out the wallet and wish hundreds or thousands of pieces of military systems into existence in a matter of days or weeks. The 100 billion Euro special fund for the armed forces they just added to the German Grundgesetz does not magically create any number of armaments they could then give away.

It is bad when a person's prejudice or traumatic experience in relation to the community becomes the basis of politics. When there is an old obsessive dictator who is getting more and more uncontrollable, we get something similar. It is more difficult for a tyrant to distinguish his own traumas and obsessions from the interests of his country, and currently Putin does not see this difference at all.

What is missing is a vision of Russian politics or what Russia will be like in the future. For once a state becomes an oligarchy, there is no future. Nothing can be changed at this stage. You can only act on the basis of the past.

""Politics of eternity"" in Russia

European countries tend to lose imperial wars. For France to be what it is today, she had to lose the war in Algeria and Vietnam. Germany was to lose on the eastern front. The Netherlands had to lose in Indonesia. Portugal and Spain - in Africa. 

The only way out for Russia is to lose this war.

Imperialism allows you to return to the old days. This is what Putin does. Ideas about past greatness as a replacement for current politics break only when faced with a very cruel reality. Its essence is that you cannot be considered an imperial state when you lose a war against a much smaller opponent.

The concept of ""rashism"" is widely used in Ukraine. Obviously, rashism is a kind of fascism because of the way the word is spelled and sounds.

It is difficult for people in the West to imagine that Russian fascism can exist, because its outer layer is anti-fascist rhetoric and the Soviet legacy of anti-fascism. A word that unites Russia and fascism can really become useful.

Atrocities in Bucha that the world saw

In the Russian war in Ukraine, Putin's ideas are of great importance. But, like Hitler's ideas, they begin with the assumption that a country is realized only outside its borders. 

Hitler's idea was that the German race had a mission that could only be fulfilled outside of Germany. Putin said that Russia can only exist as long as it absorbs Ukraine. 

How this intention becomes a policy of mass murder can only be understood when this intention coincides with reality. In the case of Germany, Hitler intended to wipe the Jews off the face of the earth. His intention was resisted by the Red Army, the Americans and the British. Then the intention manifested itself in the murder of the Jews where they lived.

In Russia's Ukraine policy, Putin's intention was for the surrender of Ukraine, the assassination of the Ukrainian political elite, and the rest of the Ukrainians being an indeterminate mass that would merge with Russia. When this did not happen, the aggravation began. More people identifying with Ukraine means more deported and killed.

Some leftists, despite their pronounced anti-imperialism, tend to be in solidarity with Russia. Why is that

People who support Russia have never been to Ukraine. Remember the Revolution of Dignity, which was much worse debated and Russian propaganda worked much better than it does now.

People who were in Ukraine, as a rule, saw the Ukrainians, their actions, understood their goals and desires, so they were less likely to accept the Russian view of events. The reason why experience is so important is that Ukrainian nationality or subjectivity is much more about actions than words and the future than myths and the past. Ideologies are quite easy to analyze by intellectuals, while experience and vision of the future, as a rule, require more personal contact.

Most people who know Russian do not know Ukrainian. It matters a lot whether they perceive Ukrainians as subjects or rely on Russian interpretations of Ukraine.

The big problem is that the American and German left is engaging in reverse nationalism. If you're a right-wing American, you think everything America does in the world is great. If you're on the American Left, you think everything America does in the world is bad.

Hence, once they take this inverted imperialist position, it seems to them that the Russians had no choice. Then they begin to argue: the Ukrainians have no choice, they must surrender. Or that the Ukrainians really don’t fight – it’s just an intermediary war and the Americans are to blame for everything. This is convenient because it confirms their deep assumption that America is responsible for everything.

There is another key problem: if no one knows anything about Ukrainian history, this opens the way for simple narratives, such as that Ukraine never existed, or that Ukraine and its culture have always been part of Russian culture.

In general, I agree with those on the left who say that American history should be taken critically. There is a big debate going on in America right now about whether or not to tell children an ""uncomfortable"" story. I think it's necessary. Your own history is always inconvenient.

We need to take the same position in relation to China and Russia. If the story is about embarrassing things, one cannot approve of its oblivion by the Russians and the taboo on the Holodomor. If one empire needs to be questioned and decentered, so must be done with all the others.

Russia is not an alternative to the United States. It looks more like a cracked mirror. If we allow our own oligarchy to go to extremes, we will end up in a country like Russia. So let's use Russia as a template for the path we shouldn't take.",930ba20ec9709e22dfb55ba50ba5dfc387df3600,True,False,,,,,0,1654773816,,0,{},ibpx032,True,t3_v8ellt,False,True,t1_ibpwyzo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8ellt/schizofascism_of_russia_by_timothy_snyder_the/ibpx032/,1654773826,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654745016.0,

Schizofascism as the basis of Russia's foreign policy

When I use the term ""schizofascism"" to describe Russia, I mean specific people. For example, Alexander Dugin (Russian philosopher, fascist publicist) or Alexander Prokhanov (Russian writer, journalist). I am quoting documents where people who are indisputably fascists call other people who are not them at all.

Since 2014, schizofascism has become the center of Russian politics, and the invasion of Ukraine is one of the most egregious examples of it: when such a regime invades another country, claiming that fascism reigns there. From a single phenomenon, schizofascism became the basis of Russia's foreign policy.

Russia is a fascist state. And here are the signs

Fascism is the priority of will over reason, a project of the political imagination. By itself, it implies a rejection of both factual and logical reality.

Some signs of postmodernism: the rejection of factual reality and the insistence on subjectivity could be interpreted in a fascist way. Suddenly we went from an idea that seemed emancipatory (meaning only individual subjectivity) to an openly repressive idea - that one person can establish a monopoly on subjectivity by declaring that there is no such thing as truth.

There are non-obvious paths to fascism. The notion that politics means victory may be an interpretation of fascism. The word ""fascism"" in the Soviet Union and in Putin's Russia lost all content and began to mean any enemy. 

A fascist in the Russian sense is not someone who has fascist views. A fascist is just a rival. But in the fascist regime itself, politics begins with the definition of the enemy. Using the word ""fascist"" to refer to an enemy is a sign of fascism. Perhaps it has its roots in the Soviet era.

Russia is a fascist state. In addition to the cult of personality, there is only one ruling party that decides everything. Elections there exist only as a ritual. There are fantasies about a golden age in the past, which can only be restored by healing violence.

This is the ideology of Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the invasion of Ukraine. Russia is even approaching the fascist notion that the very essence of politics lies in sacrifice and that the task of the leader of the nation is to give political meaning to death.

There is also total control over the media, the reuse of very simple forms of state propaganda, and Putin's idea that the West is corrupt and has abandoned core values ​​that have survived in Russia.",9a43de28e19dfecea3a883acacbc2e4c8bac0118,True,False,,,,,0,1654773794,,0,{},ibpwyzo,True,t3_v8ellt,False,True,t3_v8ellt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8ellt/schizofascism_of_russia_by_timothy_snyder_the/ibpwyzo/,1654773805,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654744994.0,

It's generally estimated [that over 80% of German losses were suffered on the eastern front.](http://gorhistory.com/hist111/WWII_EasternFront.html#:~:text=80%20percent%20of%20all%20German,fought%20returned%20after%20the%20war.) I'm not a mathematician, but that seems like a more significant share than any other. By quite a long shot. 

Just for fun, I checked the numbers for soviet produced military equipment:

265,600 army trucks

213,742 airplanes

??? tractors

119,769 tanks

And millions and millions of small arms.

Cohen, Glantz &amp; House (1995): When Titans Clash: how the red army stopped Hitler. *Foreign Affairs.* 75, p. 305

So for a seemingly impressive number like 13,000 tanks, the US provided 10%. ""14,000 airplanes"" *sounds* pretty cool, but not as cool as ""213,742 airplanes"". That's what, 6% of the sum? Couldn't find a number for blankets, I'm sorry. 

In all, the soviet union fucked up the vast majority of German troops, using mostly their own equipment and only their own army.

The reality though is, that even If ukraine completely wins the war and reclaims the territories which russia controls right now, there is still No threat to russia itself. Yes, they have thousands of dead soldiers and the sanctions hurt badly now and in the future. But:

1) It is in no ones interest to see a breakdown of the russian federation. When the Soviet Union dissolved, weapons went all over the world, creating a nightmare scenario. The Western world has No interest in that (nor China, India and many more countries)

2) 1 state with a questionable leadership with nuclear weapons is bad. Multiple states with territorial Claims vs each other with nuclear weapons is what lets politicians worldwide be scared as fucked. Its a recipe for the end of humanity (as If India - Pakistan - China in cashmir isnt Bad enough already).

3) regarding 1&amp;2, it is very likely russia will be bordering Ukraine in the future. It might be Ukraine with 2013 borders, 2022 borders or any other possibility. Thats smth that is being decided now and in the upcomming months. At some point, there needs to be a ceasefire, Peace treaty etc. Or Ukraine will be in an endless war, unable to Join NATO or the EU (by law). 

So at some Point (being it russia defeated in Ukraine and withdrawing, Ukraine and russia finding a compromise on the russian held territories right now, etc) the war will end. 

If all ties to negotiate are Cut, it is difficult to re-establish those. So i am quite sure Nobody thinks that there is the one magical call happening that solves everything. But there is a need to keep channels open If options come Up to solve the mess.

That won't be done by any other country Else than russia and ukraine, but others can Play the middle man to Forward Infos between both war Parties.",645bbef4bb9424040047d7a08ea4f13229aee2da,True,False,,,,,0,1654772204,,0,{},ibpush3,False,t3_v8dgjy,False,True,t1_ibpta53,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8dgjy/polish_president_calls_to_putin_like_talking_to/ibpush3/,1654772220,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654743404.0,

Exactly. Thanks to the victorous West, Russia like the Phoenix got it's shit together in 1920, 1946, 1991.   
The current narrtive about Russia fail is in fact, nothing more than wishful thinking of people who **are tired of war**. Yeah, the collective West is already sick and tired of this.   
In Ukraine, we passed this in the end of 2014 and in the beginning of 2015-&gt; ceasefire, Russia comes back, we are winning. It was just a Victory syndrome not a victory.   
Then we had the Debaltsevo battle and Minsk-2. Neither peace, nor victory.    
It's a long war.

&gt;It goes both ways though as lend lease expands so fingers crossed for Ukraine.

Thanks. Let's work the Western weapons that have been created for the war against Horde. These weapons are in correct place, correct arms in the correct time now.

&gt;A narcissist will fight to exhaustion rather than face loss usually and there is clearly no shortage of manpower on the Russian side.

Threat of exhaustion during a chess game against 100-pawns. It's funny, but defeat is not a game.    
That's why Ukraine require weapon of XXI century, in addition to tanks and cannons.   

At the moment, front-to-front trench warfare is imposed on Ukraine by type WWI
It's very destructive strategy because ukraine is much smaller than russia. The grinding is what russia use to do.    
There are 2 types of resources that cannot be bought back - these are time and people (grinded by war)

That is why the supply of effective modern weapons and equipment (as well as medicine), and not just guns, is so important.


&gt;Ukraine needs to mobilise more manpower to both dig in and build offensive capabilities, what’s stopping mobilisation of an extra 100k troops for guard and garrison duties whilst training?

Though it comes from the experience that conscientious workers will be overload with more work without substantial pay increase.

Good workers get to do critical tasks and are being kept if possible.

""This is not enough they sure must have thousands of MBTs available, they are Germany after all!"" or ""I bet it will be delayed, I will believe it when I see it"", and when it is bad news it's always ""Germany, Russia's ally"", ""Germany want Ukraine to lose"" ""Scholz is Putin's agent"" and shit.

It's always negative no matter what. We made ourselves heavily dependent on Russian energy and our army is a miserable disgrace, you can't even call it a joke any more, it's too sad for that. The combination of those two things will make sure that we will always appear like the ones funding the war (as if all the cost for Russian gas gets transferred 1:1 to the Russian army. Lots of it is actually to cover the cost of mining and transportation, and the Russian state has more expenses than only this war. In fact I bet if they would start getting into serious financial trouble the war would be one of the very last things they would cut. They'd rather stop paying teachers and building roads than admitting defeat in Ukraine), and we will also never be able to make up for it due to our shitty, basically non existent army and an industry which is high quality, but not suited for high quantity production.

Did I say Gulf war or invasion of Iraq?

&gt;Allow Iraq to use chemical weapons on neighbors ? Hard pass on that. How many crimes you now condemn Russia of doing do you allow Iraq before removing the regime ?

The invasion of Iraq was a shit show on false premises and propaganda that abused the trauma of Americans after 9/11, hence why the support of it has gone from 70+ for to now 70+ against, the American public was manipulated just like Putin is manipulating Russians right now.

There are 50 regimes in the world that are just as bad, but the US did not invade any of them. It wasn't about the regime, it was about special interests and it achieved nothing but death and destruction.

&gt;Afghanistan. Really ? You're going to blame us for refugees when terrorists was building a nation who condoned and acted on putting children in a cage and burning them alive ? People were savagely killed in horrific ways for sexual preference or just being a different religion, and they were poised to take over a large swath of a sovereign nation to do this to millions and yet you complain about refugees fleeing to Europe ? How about thank God they live and are safe

Afghanistan is now worse off than it was in 2000 under Taliban rule. Clearly it was a completely pointless exercise that once again only delivered death and destruction - at massive expense might I add, ending with an even further radicalized, popular and now well armed Taliban rule. 

The problem is that you are on the other side of the world and you do not get to personally face the consequences. Again there are extremely fucked up regimes right next to the US, why aren't ""well-intentioned"" invasions being staged there? They would be much easier and cheaper to maintain, albeit the millions of refugees will come to the US and the entire region will become a shit show for decades.",31893ca3eaf14f3f5115c2213109e23425ac87f3,True,False,,,,,0,1654768116,,0,{},ibppyg8,False,t3_v7z3s4,False,True,t1_ibpiwvb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7z3s4/more_german_excuses_apparently_their_m270s_need_a/ibppyg8/,1654768127,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654739316.0,

With Germany, I cannot help but notice how there seemingly are delays upon delays. At first, despite the German bashing on Reddit, I was more on the apologetic side. Sending weapons, especially heavy weaponry, is a big change in German policy, and the German military wasn't in the best state to begin with. Then there's the logistics of it. However, as time has passed, it seems there's always a new excuse. From what gather, there's a resolution in the Bundestag to aid Ukraine, and this is forcing the Chancellor's hand into action, which he is either uncomfortable or, for whatever reasons, unwilling to do. 

Macron, has been calling for tighter European military cooperation, with greater independence of the US throughout his first presidential period. He made headlines by calling NATO ""braindead"". Now that Europe is in a situation where we, in effect, are fighting a war by proxy, it seems his best answer to this is to call Putin, and to call for ""not to try humiliate"" him, likely at the expense of Ukraine having to cede territory. 

Both Scholz and Macron seem mostly concerned about what comes *after*, rather than focusing on the task at hand: stop Russian advances, and hopefully drive them back from Ukrainian territory. I also get the impression that they seem more interested in going back to the old status quo. It is my genuine belief that it is not in the Europe's best interest to let Russia prevail. Furthermore, I do not think we can fully return to the pre-war trade relations with Russia.

&gt;  
&gt;It seems that the Tsar wanted something worthy to come out of them, in comparison to the relaxed and lazy white boyar youths.  
&gt;  
&gt;P. A. Tolstoy didn't know where to get smart ones, but he assumed that noble origin of the Africans could serve as at least some guarantee of quick wit. So he did not buy ordinary kids on the market, but he liked a couple of blackies, acquired a year before by the Sultan. Whether they were captives or hostages, the opinions of historians differ.  
&gt;  
&gt;Giving a bribe to anyone who needed it, Tolstoy sent an overland expedition to Russia, covered his tracks in this story and continued his dangerous service.  
&gt;  
&gt;The kids arrived in Russia; the eldest did not show special talents that the Tsar needed, he became an oboist, and the youngest - well, the youngest, as you know, became the ""Arab of Peter the Great"" and the great-grandfather of Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin, Our All.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Now, when no one will say a good word either about the empire, or about racism, or about bribery, or about the abuse of minors, or about violations of all conceivable human rights – now, on the birthday of A.

Pramila Patten, the U.N. special representative on sexual violence in conflict, called that only the “tip of the iceberg” of “the most constantly and massively underreported allegation.”

Rape has been used as a weapon of war throughout history — whether to subjugate, terrorize or ethnically cleanse populations. Systematic sexual violence has been reported in conflicts from Myanmar to Bosnia, while historians estimate that as many as 2 million Germans were raped by Soviet troops as they advanced against Nazi forces in the last days of World War II.

Reports of Russian forces committing rape in eastern Ukraine preceded the current conflict, according to the Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict data set.

But human rights officials and advocates told The Post that they do not think rape is being coordinated and directed in Ukraine now. So far, the United Nations has “not found evidence of the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war in Ukraine,” said Matilda Bogner, the head of the U.N. monitoring mission.

Officials say they expect to hear about more cases once victims reach safety.

She was raped in Ukraine. How many others have stories like hers?
By Loveday Morris, June 8, 2022 at 4:30 a.m. EDT

“There have been multiple reports from survivors of Russia’s soldiers breaking down doors to basements where women were sheltering and raping them … done in front of their children” and “filmed by Russian soldiers,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said this week.

She added: “It is on Russia to stop rape, violence and atrocities from within its ranks.”

Russian officials have denied those claims.

“The accusations of sexual violence against the Russian army have become repetitive … but no proof has been provided,” said Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzia.

In areas like Mariupol, the major barrier to verifying reports of atrocities remains access.

Mariupol has come to symbolize Ukraine’s darkest suffering, with abuses so widespread that even Russian officials are concerned they may be undermining their claim of being “liberators,” according a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak on the record but cited a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment.

Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said he is aware of about a dozen reports of rape in the city. But fear and the fact that, for the most part, residents who want to leave can only do so through Russia, means there is little information.

An ‘unprecedented’ effort to document war crimes in Ukraine. But what chance of justice?

Kateryna told The Post that she had been sitting just inside the door to the basement, with a 75-year-old woman and the lady’s pet Chihuahua, when the Chechens entered on March 26. It was the first time any soldiers had been inside the building since the area was taken by Russian forces a few weeks earlier.

The one soldier told her she needed to come upstairs to be “examined.” The sound of shelling thundered around them, and she told him she was afraid to go up.

But he led her to an empty second-floor apartment and instructed her to bend down and rest her hands on the couch. “He showed me what I had to do,” she said. “I told him that I didn’t want to do it.”

“But he told me that he would kill me.”

She got on her knees and begged for her life.

“But he lifted me up in silence and did what he wanted,” she said.

She had few defenders in the basement that day.

She had been staying in the apartment block with her boyfriend’s family — though he had left to work overseas just before the invasion. As the weeks of subzero temperatures and food shortages continued, it was clear she had worn out her welcome. Her relationship with her own mother had long been strained, and her father had died four years earlier.

Artem, 38, an Azovstal steel plant worker she had befriended, said that when the soldiers arrived, he was at the hospital visiting his mother, who had ventured out and been hit by shrapnel from an explosion. But he corroborated Kateryna’s story, saying he later returned to the basement and heard from multiple neighbors who had witnessed her being taken upstairs.

“There were other men in the basement who could have helped her,” he said, “but they were scared as well.”

On April 25, Kateryna, Artem and three family friends made their escape, risking the journey through Russian checkpoints before crossing into Latvia and then Lithuania and on to Poland. They said they wanted to end up in Norway.

While Kateryna said she plans to report the rape someday, she also said she holds little hope of the perpetrator being punished. She never saw his face, she said, and knows nothing else about him.

“But I hope for it,” she said.

For a fleeting moment, the 19-year-old hoped the soldiers might be Ukrainian, though she knew that was unlikely in the Russian-held area.

She quickly realized they were Chechen fighters from Russia’s North Caucasus region, part of a force that gained a reputation for particularly harsh cruelty toward civilians who remained in the Ukrainian port city. The soldiers boasted about the superior uniforms given to their units.

They had rifles slung over their shoulders, she recalled, and they seemed drunk.

“We need to check documents,” she remembers one of the soldiers saying to the people huddled in the basement. As she rose to get hers, one of the men stopped her, put his hand to her cheek and complimented her on the definition of her nose. “He asked me what my name was,” she said. She sensed what was going to unfold.

“I’d already guessed deep down,” she later recounted.

Just a week into the war, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged there had been “numerous cases” of Ukrainian women being raped by Russian soldiers. But more than 100 days into the conflict, investigators are still struggling to assess the prevalence of sexual violence — and how many people have stories like Kateryna’s.

Ukraine has accused Russian troops of rape, a tough crime to prosecute

Not only is access and information limited in occupied areas such as Mariupol, but trauma, fear and stigma can deter people from coming forward.

“To investigate sexual crimes on the occupied territory, when we are still in the military conflict, is very hard,” said Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. “It’s very difficult, because the victims are actually scared.”

Polish prosecutors, who have gathered more than 1,000 war crimes testimonies from refugees, say none so far relate to sexual violence.

For the moment at least, Kateryna remains one of the uncounted. She retreated to her cot as researchers logging potential war crimes made their way around the refugee center where she was staying in Poland, having escaped Mariupol on a circuitous route through Russia.

She later volunteered her story to Washington Post journalists as they interviewed another member of her group. But as far as reporting her case to authorities, she said: “I’m not ready yet.”

It’s not unusual for people to be reluctant to file official reports, said Kateryna Cherepakha, the director of La Strada Ukraine, which runs a national hotline for victims of domestic violence and gender discrimination.

“For most cases, those who contacted our hotline aren’t willing to talk to police or prosecutor,” she said. Her organization counsels people on the reporting process so that they can come forward when they are ready. Rape during conflict is considered a war crime, and there is no statute of limitations.

Cherepakha said her volunteers have fielded calls seeking help after 16 alleged cases of rape since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February. All but one of the victims were female, and three were minors, she said. The youngest was 13.

The Ukrainian prosecutor’s office has not released its own case counts. Officials say they have only a partial picture of sexual assault in the conflict and don’t want to underplay the issue.

Other Ukrainian officials have been accused of doing the opposite — of using stories of rape to stir emotions. Ukraine’s parliament voted last week to oust human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova, based in part on concerns that she was disseminating unsubstantiated reports and focusing on the most sensationalist details, including of babies being raped.

The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been working to corroborate accounts. Of the 124 allegations of conflict-related sexual violence it has received, it was able to confirm 24 — 12 involving Russian armed forces or affiliated groups, five involving Ukrainian armed forces and seven involving unidentified individuals in territory controlled by Ukraine. The United Nations determined that another 44 were impossible to verify and that eight were false or highly unlikely. It continues to investigate another 48 allegations.",950336273d55e1ef72220f5463c7928057f8bafe,True,False,,,,,0,1654762785,,0,{},ibpkae1,True,t3_v81yqw,False,True,t3_v81yqw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v81yqw/she_was_raped_in_ukraine_how_many_others_have/ibpkae1/,1654762795,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654733985.0,

Finnish soldier was talking about (in general) fire direction / control for all the indirect weapons.

So, when you have artillery, mortars or unguided rockets you need to have system to direct the fire. 

Classic way is shown here for the typical USA field artillery setup: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Field_artillery_team#/media/File:785px_Arty_Call_for_Fire_1.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Field_artillery_team

You have group of guys observing the hits to enemy and doing then primitive mapping; what is the distance between hits and actual targets etc. They essentially adjust the fire to as close to the targets as possible.

This is called Forward Observation Group.

They then send back the information to Fire Direction Center that calculates new values (elevation etc.) for the artillery guns to improve the hits.

Guns get adjusted and new firing cycle begins.

In case of mortars it is more or less exactly same as artillery, except calculations are slightly different.

Of course in modern world you can use for example drone to observe the hits, but unless drone is quite advanced it is difficult to direct the fire accurately. This is because most of the standard drones lack proper position calculations for the objects visible to camera view.",21f988f03126c37d46e68deb261c64d673aad136,True,False,,,,,0,1654761759,,0,{},ibpj83j,False,t3_v7xc9u,False,True,t1_ibpbcnn,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7xc9u/newly_arrived_m777_howitzers_from_usa_now_with/ibpj83j/,1654761775,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654732959.0,

1. Ukraine is the defender, Russia is the (much larger) aggressor. Much of the course of the war is going to be driven by what Russia chooses to do, with Ukraine biding its time and counterstriking when it is advantageous.
2. Ukraine has less military resources than Russia, which limits what it can do, at any particular time, to affect the course of war. Having more citizens it can conscript means squat if it doesn't receive the necessary equipment to arm these conscripts. 
3. Ukraine lacks a clear picture (and timetable) of the kind and quantity of equipment if can hope to receive from the West. Hard to plan an offensive when you're not sure of what you're getting and when. Even harder when you expect to receive something, only to be told later that it's gonna take longer than planned.

In short, Ukraine would have a clearer war strategy if the West didn't faff around so much and were more resolute in terms of what they were willing to do to help Ukraine fight off Russia.",8ea640c9e0834414ebaf95557bf9266aa49ff737,True,False,,,,,0,1654761723,,0,{},ibpj6sx,False,t3_v8aru3,False,True,t3_v8aru3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8aru3/us_lacks_a_clear_picture_of_ukraines_war_strategy/ibpj6sx/,1654761733,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654732923.0,

Has Germany just assumed that USA will 100% pay to protect Germany and as such they don't need any military of their own all while they give 100's of billions of dollars to Russia annually for cheap energy, which Russia uses to build up their military, which further threatens Germany, and further assumes the USA would protect Germany if need be from the Russian military that they indirectly fund?

Yes.

For some additional context, they not only fund the Russian War effort they actively armed them. e.g., Germany is the 4th largest arms supplier in the world, but they ""had a rule they wouldn't ship arms to actively conflicts"" hence just sending Ukraine some helmets. Meanwhile, they broke apart systems to label them for non-military use and sent them to Russia. The equivalent of taking apart a gun and saying the scope is for looking at things, the barrel could be used as a paperweight and the stock could be firewood. Then they showed up at NATO exercises having broomsticks because their guns weren't serviceable (this actually happened) and as of the start of the conflict had like 18 working planes.

It's not even just them not pulling their weight (Canada, etc.) but when you look at the situations Germany is either NATO's Palpatine or Jar Jar when you look at the situations they've not only enabled but sometimes created. And the best part is the smugness at every turn -- remember awhile ago when everyone was going on about Europe hates us, much of it timed to sanctions being levied against their Russian pipeline. It's absolutely bonkers, the only reason more aren't up in arms about it is because they're in the dark about it, including the German people. I swear half of them think Russian oil/gas was cut off when the SWIFT sanctions hit, and don't realize they're paying now buying it in rubles.",a871ace3035b6693d816c3ff0f24907c2cc72fca,True,False,,,,,0,1654761111,,0,{},ibpijfq,False,t3_v7z3s4,False,True,t1_ibnrzku,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7z3s4/more_german_excuses_apparently_their_m270s_need_a/ibpijfq/,1654761128,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654732311.0,

 It might mean you take some 5-10 years before you get your hands on shiny new stuff, like newer Leopard tanks, and in the meanwhile the old ones are being used to the furthest extent to get the most out of your previous purchase.

 Once your new shiny stuff arrive, the old ones are usually degraded down to trainer vehicles, before getting mothballed. Or in the case of APC/IFV's they might be downgraded to homeguard/national guard use, in which case they're often less militarized, to keep the maintenance lower. 

I know that has been the case in Denmark at least. We've run out old F-16's broken, more or less. To the point that the airframe itself is starting to show signs of wear and tear, and the cost of maintenance is becoming too high.

Russia's Russia-based S400s in and of themselves make much of the conflict area almost an absolute no go zone for Ukrainian aircraft - several have been lost already tempting this.

Russia can launch (Tu95, Tu160, Tu22M) air launched weapons against any city it wants in ukraine with virtual impunity, with the only real limit being the number of such weapons in their inventory.   

Russia's CAS options are limited and this was never a strong point of theirs anyway.  however, even in a comparable situation iraq war 1, the US lost a very large amount of aircraft despite nominally having ""air superiority"" before the aircraft (US Navy aircraft in particular) were forbidden from descending below small AA height.  Same situation here.

I'm curious what you mean by ""air superiority.""  you mean that there are no Tu95s over Kyiv?  Sure, but this doesn't fit in with the war picture at the moment anyway.

The real picture is not so rosy, unfortunately.

Schröder started the reliance on Russia and the SPD as junior partner of the coalition with Merkel for almost a decade made sure to continue that legacy. Merkel, truely a fangirl of Russia, didnt mind and enjoyed absolute power as nothing could really challenge the great coalition of CDU+SPD. So why give a shit about the consequences of your decisions of you are untouchable and dont need to fear the backlash of voters?

Every NATO country. That's the *entire* point of NATO - when you attack one NATO country, every other country shows up and fights for them *and* it works because each of those countries has a compatible supply line. 

At one end you can take a bullet from any NATO country and put it in a gun from any other over the whole range of ammo. At the other end, you can take an AWACS from any NATO county and use it to command and send direct battlefield information to a fighter plane from any other NATO country.

This type of story would be quite easy to dispel. Make sure that there are large numbers of German heavy weapons, even if it was just 30 PzH2000s, in Ukraine, working and shooting. Germany should be able to match the other countries such as Poland.

And poor, ineffective maintenance means poor, ineffective logistics. Without maintenance you haven't got logistics. Without logistics you can't fight a war. You can throw bodies at the enemy with their personal weapon and the army's remaining arty but that won't win you the war. 

It was the academics &amp; retired military who commented about the simply apparent. That is the Russians can't really fight as a modern army. They haven't the structure. They haven't skilled manpower. They haven't the modern tech. 

But it was Telenko who opened non-military people to realising like a business you need inputs, allocation of productive factors, processing and then distribution. Russia doesn't have the systems to run a war. 

Russia runs a WW2 meat grinder, thug army that bludgeons a civilian pop and its military to death, over time. Attempting to collapse the state as a functioning whole. It worked in small places where it had complete control. Russia bludgeoned to death Chechnya and Georgia. It failed in Syria bc Assad's enemies could be resupplied. Sure they lost cities, but like WW2 partisans behind enemy lines all you need to fight is a guerrilla campaign with RPG's, portable modernish weapons, a bag of rice or bulgar. Syria could not be geographically isolated. 

Now with Ukraine surrounded by NATO, with Poland - a country that hates Russia more than any other - able to funnel food, supplies and western arms, even personnel - Russia is getting its arse beat even with Ukraine fighting with 10%-20% of Russian armament quantity but far superior in quality and tech. Just as Russia kept going in WW2 due to Lend Lease - they are now the Nazi's where Ukraine is now the recipient of an almost unending supply of western firepower.   

[Now we are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaHumanRights/comments/v6exib/vladimir_osechkin_of_gulagunet_received_700_gb_of/) if this is true and the West can validate Russian nuclear forces are as equally corrupt - meaning as equally unreliable as their trucks, the West will push harder with less fear of nuclear retaliation. This is highly significant and the most important news in the last 30 days - if true. 

Add in that 20% of their missile stocks are outright duds. Another 20% fail in flight due to malfunctioning electronics of one kind or another, add in another 20% take flight but fail to detonate, add in another 20% that do not land within the CEP and you have somewhere around 20% of Russian missiles of all kinds being successful in hitting their targets accurately and causing damage. 

But the worst news for the West is - speaking in terms of socio-economics - is that domestically 2/3 of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. 64% of Americans can't meet an unexpected $400 bill. All the corporate elites will suddenly realise we are currently unparalleled in our military ability. 1/ They are not looking at China bc it appears China could also be a paper tiger of sorts 2/ the elites with weakening our society realise they can screw over even more Americans, weaken the economy social structure even further and the USA still remains No:1. 

So while ordinary people think yipee we won, they lose with respect to their own quality of life. I ask people to bear in mind 2 associations (1) how did western life for ordinary people improve after the collapse of Russia - it did not it became worse for the majority of working people with wages not reflecting the cost of living (2) The high inflation we have now and the concomitant high interest rates when inflation is cost push (not demand driven) means that the Govt/Fed are protecting asset prices and once again sacrificing workers. When wars are won or the enemy defeated it just means the corporate elites are able to take more from your pocket.

I’ve said this many times on this thread before but in order for Ukraine to win this war all they need to do is make this war go on. Something they clearly intend on doing btw. Battlefield victories translate to a better hand during negotiations, but civil strife and endless perpetual war against a determined enemy is something Russia can not afford regardless of how many ancient tanks and artillery pieces they have. Ukraine and in particular the United States knows that very well. That’s why you see so many videos near Lviv of new Ukrainian units being built with polish/Czech T-72’s, M113’s and other western weapons/equipment. They’re preparing to make this very drawn out and costly for Russia. Also the prospect of any of these unused freshly trained and equipped Ukrainian units being thrown at literally *any* weak spot of this huge front line will be completely devastating for Russian morale. So far the Russians have been dealing with only localized counter attacks with small company/battalion sized units. These attacks have been relatively successful for Ukraine and it’s likely designed to test the defense in certain sectors. I could imagine if a major offensive *does* materialize, it will likely be a lightning drive towards Melitopol or Kherson. Moderate success in any attack like this for Ukraine will have really devastating cascading effects  on Russian morale. The simple fact of the matter is that Ukraine has the military industrial complex of the entire western military alliance behind it. Ukraine could force this war to go on at the tempo it’s at forever.

5. I point out that if he wants to take on the russians, he can indeed do so.  i further my call for sympathy for actual ukrainian soldiers. i am massively downvoted.  

this is how this subreddit goes.  it's a cavalcade of bravado and bullshit.  a few days ago i was called a ""russian bot"" for pointing out that ukraine desperately needs more weapons. when i pointed out that this was the conclusion of zelenskiy, kuleba, the UK MOD, and many others, I was told that they were all playing 4d chess.     I was called an ""appeaser"" for pointing out that unless ukraine gets those weapons, it will lose territory.",47d0bc9c5b52db3d0b5a69fc17587d1ec3000b38,True,False,,,,,0,1654754551,,0,{},ibpassg,False,t3_v7txr9,False,True,t1_ibolk8b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7txr9/russia_threatens_direct_airstrikes_on_ukrainian/ibpassg/,1654754564,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654725751.0,

A terrorist state uses puppet armies that it does not directly control or recognize. Hezbollah is a puppet army of Iran.

The Russian army operating in Ukraine is recognized by Russian and operates within it's chain of command. Russia is not acting as a terrorist state. There is a difference.

Saudi Arabia has never sought a nuclear weapons program or nuclear weapons, so i am not sure why you brought them up.

I was also not speaking of terrorist states, but terrorist organizations that operate with no allegiance to any state and are not recognized as a nation. Al Queda is an example of a terrorist organization.

Random terrorist don't care about maintaining nuclear weapons. Their goal is to use them as soon as they get them. The maintenance cost is irrelevant to them.

Just hoping that you will be the highest bidder if you happen to hear about the sale is one strategy that I am sure is used, but it isn't the only one.

Ok dog

&gt;so far they only delivered anything to Ukraine when they got something in return

List the things the got in return for what they've send.

&gt;Only if the US gave them F16's and only if the us gave the jets to Ukraine

Poland wanted to purchase planes in addition to [F-35](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/01/31/poland-inks-46-billion-contract-for-f-35-fighter-jets/) they also purchased.

&gt;At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.

&gt;Tanks? Only in exchange for tanks.

Poland did not recieve any tanks - Poland purchased 250 Abrams tanks from the US to replace their T-72 fleet.

https://www.army-technology.com/news/poland-deal-abrams-tanks/

&gt;Artillery? Sure, just pay.

Ukraine recieved 18 KRAB SPH's as immediate help, and Ukraine expressed interest to buy more of them.

&gt; The information released by the Polish outlet suggests that the first 18 howitzers (one, three-battery squadron) already transferred are not covered under this contract, and they were indeed provided to Poland’s neighbour as a gift. It seems that Ukraine expressed reciprocity, procuring another three squadrons (54 guns), at a market price.

&gt; UN chief Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the consequences for the world of Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine are worsening, with 1.6 billion people likely to be affect.

&gt; The report says that the war may increase the number of food-insecure people by 47 million people in 2022, bringing it to 323 million by the end of the year.

&gt; Extreme poverty in the Middle East and North Africa could increase by 2.8 million people in 2022, while in South Asia 500 million people are at risk, according to the report.

So the bad news is that it will be at least 1-2 weeks until the Ukrainians get their hands on the first batch of this hardware. The good news is that, after the first batch is delivered to Ukraine, it now sounds like Ukraine will get a fresh platoon of MLRS and HIMARS from the UK band US, respectively, about once every 3-4 weeks moving forward. So, these systems are not just limited to the initial 8 or so units that will be provided.

Fucking Reddit pitchfork brigades frothing at the mouth even though this fucking post has little to nothing to do with tweet it links to. If you have zero reading-comprehension of GERMAN, do not fucking post English nonsense about it, if all you can find is a tweet referencing another article WITHOUT ANY PROPER SOURCE, don’t fucking post that shit.

1.	The so-called “article text” supposedly from Business Insider contains no link to any original source or a proper source link of any kind.
2.	The German “article text” in the tweet does NOT say Germany won’t deliver any MARS II systems, it only says that the German launchers are incompatible with US and UK ammunitions - NOTHING ELSE
3.	For all you genius armchair-coders… what fucking country has software lying about to enable their weapon systems to work with other countries’ ammunition?!?? If the “article text” is actually correct, and that’s a big if since there is NO SOURCE, the time span months doesn’t mean it’ll take months to apply a software, but that it’ll take months to develop and apply it. Flipping morons.

Again, geniuses, NOWHERE does the linked to tweet say anything that Germany won’t deliver any MARS II systems for months, simply that it could take months if the systems had to be updated to work with other countries’ ammunition.

Read, for fuck’s sake, then take a deep breath, and then get out the pitchforks.

&gt; In an interview with Ridus.ru, industry expert Sergei Aslanyan explained the depth of the crisis. “We don’t have electronics factories, we don’t have anything to make an engine out of. We have ‘Niva,’ which is 45 years old, 20 percent consists of imports,” he said referring to one model produced by Russian manufacturer Lada. But, he added, “It has pistons and piston rings from the American corporation Federal Mogul. And now we will even have nothing to assemble the Niva from. What are we going to make air bag systems from? Who will present us with an airbag? Nobody. We don’t even have bearings.”

&gt; The prospect that a nationwide import substitution program, which the Kremlin is pushing, will fill the gaps is a pipedream, argue experts. “Even the Soviet archaic Moskvich [car model] cannot be revived today. Where can I get it? It disappeared a long time ago. I’m afraid that even the documentation can only be found in the museum.

these days, and sodomized her, like her English “husband“ another illuminatI,  knowing who she was to me and God, the Mother of Empires,  the mother of my Son, for he knew him,  before he was born, in the womb he formed him, God suggests you run to a Catholic Church and go to confession and repent, I have St. George in me, the Dragon slayer, and satan can not touch, me he only paws at me and swipes at air, and I feel it, and St. George, says, England, repent, for not one of you will see, Paradise, if you do not go to a Catholic Church, satan has damned you, and he wants to collect you and take you to your new home, this is real, it is Revelations,  for it is better to go to Heaven without a cock, than go to hell to see what satan will do to it, and what he will do to your ass, sodomize it, repentance, now open, free admission as always,  first come first serve, at a Catholic Church, near you, small donation, appreciated, so they can eat,  but no worries, no ID necessary, no one will ask, just walk in, forgive me father, for I have sinned and I have committed these sins, and I never confessed them, and say what comes to your head, and then eat his body, and do it once a week on Saturday or Sunday, Amen, Jesus, says, Tsar Vladimir Putin, the ides of March, Caesar sings, and Heaven cries, Havoc, and let slip the dogs of war, for Russia will not survive after that date, and the more time you wait, the more people will suffer, until you explode, and all the nukes are launched, and then you will be blamed, for all the needless suffering, so the world can know the Truth, the Anti Christ will arise, and blame Catholics, like Biden, and Putin, of the legitimate, Orthodox Faith, under the Consecration of Mary, Mother of God, in her service, for escalating the war, when all he wanted as weapons,  to get his land back, a lie, and deception,  for he wants to destroy Russia,  so Mary’s immaculate heart does not triumph, like she said to the 3 little shepherd girls in Fatima, and Medjugerje, is the last time she will appear, until she comes in Triumph back to earth, and steps on the snake with her beautiful water wet feet, for Her son, will turn the blood 🩸 into water before each step, and then, with a pink rose on her right beautiful perfect foot, between her toes, she will lift her bare foot, and gently step on that rotten talking snake, and I will put the apple 🍎 in his mouth and in her name, order him to bite down, for if she opens her mouth and speaks to him, he will suffer, the most painful torment in all of Creation, for her voice sings like a canary and whispers love of infinite intensity, and melody so pure and true, that this is my message to you, repent,  and Mary’s Immaculate Heart, without ever saying a word, in its silence, defeated satan, with out ever saying a word, Mary Orders you to launch the Nukes on the Ides of March, or they will overrun Russia and kill you, Tsar Putin, and then destroy us all, and starve us, and kills us, and rape us, if you don’t, they will nuke Kiev, and Zelensky, from the tribe of Dan, will hide, in his bunker, and the lying media will blame you, for it is under their control.  And obliterate you before you can retaliate, One way you are going to launch those nukes, before Biden loses the next election to Trump, and he kicks ass, at Dulce and arrests them all and exposes them,  satan will never allow that.  Launch them all, says Mary, at the targets, especially Toronto, uses a tsar Bomba, the biggest one you have, make sure it even destroys wasaga beach, and buries sodom and Gomorrah, for not even Children are safe here any more. And in Heaven and earth, it will be called lake Trudeau, don’t worry, with a permanent rainbow, over it and great bass and Muskie fishing, it’s not suicide if Mary takes you and us, to Heaven, and the damned to hell, it is called Justice and it is not murder, if she orders you to launch the nukes for she has authority from God and she does his will, and only God can kill. So do it, it is the will of God, and Mary and Jesus, and all of Heaven, one will, one God, for ever and ever amen. J.

That's a good comment overall, but this part surprised me.  I've long thought that an important lesson from the 30s and 40s was that Nazism, Fascism, and other genocidal authoritarian regimes could happen to any country.  Nazism wasn't genetically encoded in German DNA, and there was nothing really in German culture that forced them down that path.  It was a combination of societal collapse, economic desperation, and political instability that lead them to pick the person with the ""simple"" explanations, and this can happen to any country or any ethnicity.

That sentence in your comment made me realize that this apparently isn't the viewpoint of a lot of people in Germany and that they thought the Russians (and maybe other societies) were incapable of embracing the same awful ethno-nationalism that they did in the 30s.",8b34e2a7fe0313d422d92e62c9afa32f5840682d,True,False,,,,,0,1654742337,,0,{},iboqxy5,False,t3_v7z3s4,False,True,t1_ibnwpjz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7z3s4/more_german_excuses_apparently_their_m270s_need_a/iboqxy5/,1654742350,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654713537.0,

Well, when I see there is false information around we speak up. And since there is a lot of it around, we habe to do so regularly. E.g. the Marders and Leo's were never promised by Germany, so it can't be a broken promise. Also many other facts also get dropped conveniently, like the Swiss blocking ammo supplies for Marders and Gepards because neutrality, making the use of those tanks for Ukrainians questionable. 

I do agree that Scholz is a coward and I feel highly embarrassed for him. And things do take an awful long time, for decades now everything involving the army and equipment in Gwrmany was a shit show, and if you get announced as defense minister you pretty much know you must have fucked up in the past and your career will be over soon. We are pretty much the opposite of what the Wehrmacht used to be, and I'd say this is by design and wanted that way, because of a bad collective conscience. And now, with a new, actual threat at the horizon it suddenly appears that stance was wrong and naive, but as a whole we still lack the mental capability to change the attitude to more militarism. There is still the notion that we must not escalate things, that Russia must not be provoked too mich because nukes, etc., it's all very... pitiful and miserable. 

But when I come here and read all those comments like ""Germany on Russia's side"" and everything, I just want to punch people in their face until they have no teeth left. As if being slow and ill equipped was equal to helping Russians. Thus sub is super unfair und super biased against Germany, and I find their comments offensive and hurtful.

It isn't the shell type that makes the M777 so accurate at 20km it is the fire control system, which to my knowledge the Ukranians aren't getting.  The shell you are talking about makes it similarly accurate at 40km.  This goes back to that quality comment I mentioned way back above.

Artillery isn't just for suppression, though that is critical.  It often is responsible for a large proportion of battlefield caulsualties and destruction of materiel.  This is one of the reasons the Russians even though having an edge in artillery numbers have an effectiveness issue.  There artillery army was supposed to have massed infantry and motorized to go along with their doctrine and they just don't have it.

I actually totally disagree with you on Ukraine needing to produce any arms.  If you look at a war economy as a combination of combat mobilization logistics and production, way better for Ukraine to leave the production out of country where it can't be bombed and concentrate for now on logistics and mobilization.

&gt; BERLIN - Angela Merkel defended her diplomatic legacy as German chancellor Tuesday, rejecting accusations that her policies while leading Europe&amp;#039;s largest economy for 16 years were indirectly to blame for Russia&amp;#039;s ongoing attack on Ukraine.

&gt; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in April called out Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, arguing their long-standing policy of &amp;quot;Concessions to Russia&amp;quot; and opposition to putting Ukraine and Georgia on a path toward NATO membership had encouraged Moscow to think &amp;quot;They are allowed to do anything they want&amp;quot; with Ukraine and commit &amp;quot;Even the most horrific war crimes&amp;quot; such as in Bucha.

&gt; Merkel on Tuesday defended her decision not to grant Ukraine the so-called NATO Membership Action Plan at the alliance&amp;#039;s Bucharest summit in 2008, citing two reasons: First, she said Ukraine &amp;quot;Was not a democratically consolidated country&amp;quot; then, still strongly influenced by oligarchs and plagued by corruption.

In Russia's case, Muscovy's victories in wars against the Mongols (14th century) and the neighbouring Republic of Novgorod (15th century) are considered foundational. I wouldn't call the war against the Mongols an expression of nascent Russian imperialism, but the war against Novgorod *could* count. By that time, Muscovy was starting to expand and was trying to establish supremacy in Eastern Europe as the ""true"" successor of Kyivan Rus'.

In hindsight, it was likely detrimental to the rest of the world that the Mongol-influenced autocracy of Muscovy ultimately snuffed out the Byzantine-Scandinavian Republic of Novgorod. A victory by the more progressive Republic of Novgorod with its links to the Hanseatic League might have led the Russians' ancestors to reintegrate better with Europe and steered it away from the fate of living in the expanding despotic shithole of Muscovy which then mutated into Czarist, Imperial, Soviet and finally post-Soviet Russia.

In Canada's case, you're right that Canada didn't exist as something independent, and it wasn't founded on an imperialist war by being the aggressor or leading combatant. However the War of 1812 was (partially) foundational to Canada by fostering a unifying sense of ""Canadianness"" and colonists being distinct from both Americans and Britons even though the imperialists involved were the British Empire and the up-and-coming USA.

WW I is sometimes considered Canada's ""foundational"" war because of the [Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917](https://www.warmuseum.ca/the-battle-of-vimy-ridge/). A Canadian army fought and won against the Germans. However, I wouldn't call it imperialistic from Canada's point of view despite its importance in Canadian nationalism.

Canada was dragged into the war because it was a dominion of the British Empire and so was obliged to fight alongside Britain anyway but wouldn't necessarily expect to gain territory for itself in case of victory.",5e277f4785592d32dcfaaba35508aa632612438b,True,False,,,,,0,1654739185,,0,{},iboko45,False,t3_v7yvn1,False,True,t1_ibo9sga,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7yvn1/kamil_galeev_thread_on_why_replacing_putin_with/iboko45/,1654739203,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654710385.0,

6361,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"The U.S. military has devised a plan to train a platoon of Ukrainian soldiers at a time on how to use sophisticated multiple-launch rocket artillery, the Pentagon’s top general said Wednesday, raising the likelihood that more of the weapons could be sent to Ukraine.

The plan is contingent on an initial group of Ukrainian soldiers, now learning the system from U.S. troops in Germany, showing proficiency on it, said Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The transfer of additional rocket artillery to Ukraine from existing U.S. Army or U.S. Marine Corps stocks also would require explicit approval from the Biden administration.

“We’ve got to start this thing with a program that is rational and deliberate and gets them trained to a standard where they become effective,” Milley said, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from France. “It will do no good to just throw this weapon system into the battle. You’ve got to be trained on it to get the maximum effective use out of the weapon as a precision system.”

The comments came after the Biden administration last month approved the transfer of four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, to Ukraine, and after Britain said it would send three M270 multiple-launch rocket systems, which perform a similar function. The British also will train a platoon at a time under the plan, Milley said, allowing Ukrainian forces to build up their rocket artillery.

Ukrainian officials have said for days that they need dozens of rocket artillery systems to beat back Russian forces, who continue to make slow gains in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region after a full-scale invasion launched Feb. 24.

Milley said that the Russians have “demonstrated that they are outgunning and outranging Ukrainian artillery” so far in fighting in the eastern Donbas region, which has become the primary emphasis in Russian operations.

The United States already has shipped Ukraine dozens of M777 howitzers, artillery that commonly launches explosive 155 mm rounds up to about 25 miles. Milley said Ukrainian forces have used those weapons to great effect, but the Ukrainians need “some longer-range artillery systems” that can reach farther distances.

Colin Kahl, the U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, left open the possibility that the United States could send additional HIMARS to Ukraine as he announced June 1 the first four systems had been approved. The United States first wants to get more information about how useful they are and how the Ukrainians are using them, he said. He predicted then that it would take about three weeks to train the first group of Ukrainian soldiers. Milley said Wednesday that it will take three or four.

The Biden administration approved the transfer of the first four systems after receiving assurances from Ukraine that it would not use them to launch cross-border attacks on Russia, Kahl said. The administration also decided to send munitions for them that have a range of about 45 miles, rather than the long-range Advanced Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can reach up to 186 miles.

Both the HIMARS and multi-launch system that the British are providing require a significant amount of training, Milley said. U.S. troops have developed an accelerated training program for Ukrainian soldiers who already have fired other kinds of artillery in part because they are not starting from scratch.

“The Ukrainians have very good artillerymen. Very good gunners. They’re excellent at artillery,” Milley said. “But they have been using Soviet-era systems, and then transitioning to different [Western] systems.”

On Wednesday, Ukrainian forces remained locked in a brutal fight to maintain territory in the city of Severodonetsk, a key battleground in the Kremlin’s bid to capture the Donbas region, as Kyiv and Moscow continue to spar over a U.N.-backed proposal to avert worsening global food shortages by securing safe corridors for millions of tons of Ukrainian grain.

Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian troops were facing an onslaught of Russian shelling that is targeting Ukrainian-held supply lines in Severodonetsk, the largest city in Ukraine’s Luhansk region, where Moscow claims it now controls 97 percent of the territory.

“Fierce battles are taking place … Our defenders are fighting for every inch of the city,” said Haidai, who acknowledged that Ukrainian troops may need to “withdraw to stronger positions.”

Local officials have confirmed that Russian forces have captured most residential areas in the city as part of their advance, but Britain’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday reported that Ukrainian defenses “are holding” and said neither side has gained much ground over the past day.

Severodonetsk would be a significant symbolic win for Moscow, which claims it has recently restored rail and road links to the annexed Crimean peninsula via freshly captured Ukrainian cities, consolidating its gains in the country’s south.

What to know about Severodonetsk, the Ukrainian city Russia wants to capture

Turkish and Russian foreign ministers met in Ankara on Wednesday for “substantial” talks on a U.N.-backed proposal for secure safe shipping lanes, designed to facilitate exports of some 20 million tons of grain trapped by a Russian blockade of the Black Sea ports.

The blockade has raised alarms over a potential global food shortage that could lead to famine in developing countries if shipments aren’t able to leave the ports, some of which have been littered with defensive Ukrainian mines and are under fire from Russian land and sea units.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said following the meeting that the proposal — which reportedly includes a plan for Turkey to assist in demining the Ukrainian ports and escorting commercial vessels — was “reasonable.” He also said it’s “entirely legitimate” for Russia to request relief from sanctions on its own exports as part of any deal. No immediate agreements have come of the talks.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday blamed Ukraine for the impasse and said Russia was willing to provide security guarantees if Kyiv agreed to remove mines from its Black Sea ports or “ensure passage through the minefields, as our Turkish friends are telling us.”

Lavrov denied the current global food shortage was linked to the war in Ukraine, while European Union leaders railed against what they say are Russian efforts to weaponize food supplies since the invasion began. Speaking in the European Parliament on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Union’s executive branch, said the blockade on Ukrainian grain was “a cold, callous and calculated siege by Putin on some of the world’s most vulnerable countries.”

Ukraine has made urgent calls for a deal on the shipping lanes, but remains wary of the U.N. proposal, which it says could allow Russia to exploit safe zones to carry out strategic attacks on southern cities, including Odessa, which is still under Ukrainian control.

Cholera fears prompt quarantine in Mariupol, official says

The White House announced on Wednesday that President Biden will travel to Europe for Group of Seven and NATO summits later this month where he will meet with global leaders to discuss further efforts so support Ukraine, as well as the food and energy crisis caused by the conflict.

Foreign fighters from Britain and Morocco who joined the war in Ukraine against Russia have gone on trial this week, according to Russian media.

Two British men, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, as well as a Moroccan identified as Brahim Saadoun, appeared in a courtroom behind bars in footage on the Belarusian outlet Nexta. They were asked whether they had any objections to their indictments, and all answered no before taking a seat.

The men are accused of acting as mercenaries, according to Nexta. The trial is taking place in a pro-Russian separatist region of Donetsk, under the control of the prosecutor general’s office of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.

Meanwhile, nuclear radiation detectors are back up and running at the Chernobyl site for the first time since the war began, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said.

“Dozens” of radiation detectors “are once again transmitting data,” after teams “succeeded in reviving a vital information link that was cut at the start of the conflict more than 100 days ago,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement Tuesday.

The detectors were set up after the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl to monitor radiation levels around the defunct plant in northern Ukraine.

The radiation monitoring network in the area stopped functioning on Feb. 24, the first day of Russia’s invasion after its troops occupied the Chernobyl site, the IAEA said. Russian forces held the Chernobyl zone for five weeks before withdrawing at the end of March amid an international outcry and fears of another nuclear disaster.",21284a77a29d32e1616598e979ad1aa08326639e,True,False,,,,,0,1654737602,,0,{},ibohfpw,True,t3_v854rv,False,True,t3_v854rv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v854rv/us_military_plans_to_train_ukrainian_soldiers_on/ibohfpw/,1654737613,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654708802.0,

Was reading a report by a volunteer I try to support about how he and others took essentials to a village near the border with Belarus. All the bridges are out so river crossings are by military pontoons where available - and when not, it's wooden bridges incapable of taking a truck - with mined roads and the consequence of huge detours to try and find a way. He said the people he met had been left with quite literally nothing after the Russian occupation and that's compounded by those problems to even get the essentials to them.

If a scenario arose where Russia and the US were faced off over contested territory, and it looked like Russia was trying to turn it into a meat grinding attritional artillery duel, where they had the upper hand, I'm pretty sure the US (and / or NATO allies) would change tactics, or rather, retreat, and deploy their preferred tactic in nearly all situations - bomb the shit out of the enemy with as many PGM's as could physically be launched.
