[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;For example, most countries have banned the use of cluster bombs. The US has not, and uses them extensively. 

First, no major global military power has stopped using cluster munitions (not just bombs, because that is only one type of delivery system) because it would be outright suicidal to stop, they are just too effective to not at least have the option to use them without a one for one replacement that at least comes close. The current munitions being selected to replace them don't, they're just bigger HE frag bombs, but I guess that is good enough to assuage Princess Di's cause celebre. But they're not ready yet, there is no replacement, so when Trump rightly decided not to lose major tactical capabilities he wasn't just being an asshole, he was doing what pretty much everyone in uniform had been recommending to Obama before him.   

Second, the US never signs those types of bans because the implications that we can never use them no matter what. But there are a bunch of bans we are party to and follow. The Hague Convention is another example, we didn't sign/ratify that but we still follow it. 

Third, we have not used them extensively in the GWOT, we barely used them at all. Point of fact, cluster munition strike by tube arty, MLRS, or cluster bomb are much more lethal and effective against enemy in the open in places (like in Afghanistan) than any other weapon. And yet there is so little footage of it, and instead we're using things like 500-2,000 lb JDAMs or 155mm HE or 30mm A-10 gun runs, all of which are less effective, because we weren't allowed to use cluster munitions, because Princess Di's corpse might get upset. 

 

&gt;but they are by their very nature extremely indiscriminate, especially once the conflict is over.

No they aren't. You are confusing non-precision guided munition with indiscriminate. 

Indiscriminate, which means random and without careful judgement, does not describe the US bombing effort in 

A single DPICM shell called in on an 8 digit grid is not indiscriminate, anymore than a sniper firing an unguided bullet at a target is indiscriminate. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;at the time of Desert Storm, probably was just about as indiscriminate as the Russians are, just because of the heavy use of unguided aerial bombing. 

That's simply not true at all. 

The US dropped a large number of unguided bombs during ODS but they weren't indiscriminate based on the actual definition. They were dropped on targets like the Saddam Line, Iraqi air bases, etc, which were legit targets identified by intel, plotted on maps, given to pilots or others in briefings, and then hit at accurately as was possible with dumb bombs. Even the B-52 ""arclight"" strikes weren't random or done without careful judgment, they were used against Iraqi fixed defensive positions.  Even the USAF strategic bombing mission done against Iraqi infrastructure that occasionally killed Iraqi civilians wasn't indiscriminate either. Indiscriminate bombing is WW2 shit like ""Dresden is down there, bombs away."" 

When it comes to my previous use of the word ""indiscriminate"" describing the Russians I chose that deliberately, when it comes to fires when its used against civilian populated areas specifically urban, the LOAC literally specify random firing as illegal. Cluster or even incendiary munitions used against legitimate military targets that can be identified on a map aren't indiscriminate. Firing those into downtown Kharkiv or Mariupol, because Russian army YOLO, that is indiscriminate. And illegal. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The US military has also continued to be indiscriminate in some cases: to my eyes, Mosul looks somewhat more destroyed than Mariupol, Raqqa looks less.

And yet funny enough, most analysts suggest Raqqa got it far worse. 

Plus, nearly all of that was done either with PGMs or by dumb arty called in and directed by forward observers onto specific targets. So again, not random and not without careful judgement, especially considering that JAG officers were still involved in the decision making.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Desert Storm, Iraq was a pretty good stand-in in terms of capability to Ukraine today.

Not even close. Its not a good stand in for capability or size or nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; So that's the war that makes sense as a point of comparison, not the wars of the GWOT. 

Funny enough, the OIF ""Coalition of the Willing"" invasion of Iraq was scary similar to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The biggest difference was the White House strategic level threat assessment that most Iraqis wouldn't fight back was correct, whereas the Kremlin assessment of the Ukraine will to fight was hilariously off. 

Both were notoriously light on sufficient ground troops. Neither waited for a sustained air campaign to attrit the enemy before the ground offensive started. Both had a strategy focused on road-bound massed ground mech units to head ASAP to strategic objectives (Baghdad vs Kyiv). Luckily the Iraqis, by and large, didn't fight back then, and didn't possess modern weaponry either. 

Our armored Thunder Runs driving through Baghdad got lit the fuck up by RPG-7s but were able to shrug most of them off. Had those been NLAWs or Javelins, that brigade would have been gutted.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's why both the US, and the USSR, used them extensively in a similar scenario (Vietnam, Afghanistan respectively). 

Vietnam was 50 years ago. We also extensively used napalm and Agent Orange then too. Times have changed. 

Which is why I'm not talking about what happened half a century ago, I'm describing the difference between modern Russia and modern US fires.",d5a8fe787a10e812c49d695e5a391d20782c7860,True,False,,,,,0,1654815321,,0,{},ibsfhn3,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t1_ibs5tfr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibsfhn3/,1654815338,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654786521.0

The prior generation is from an ArF laser which generates 193nm light which to get down to the 1xnm &amp; 2xnm range you need multi-patterning which requires multiple passes through the machine with a bunch of post processing on other equipment.  It's that latter part which has been the secret semiconductor sauce pre-EUV introduction in scaling down devices for the last 20 years.  That requires multiple different vendors in multi disciplines working  the tech with the foundry/IDM/manufacturer/etc doing process integration/development (also called process node).  There is no such thing as a 28nm machine but a 28nm process enabled by an advanced enough scanner is (though in their defense you need a stepper with enough precession to line up the past layers with the current printing layer to hit your critical dimensions/overlays)

&gt;none of the examples are irreplaceable.

They are, however, not entirely plug and play either.  Even more basic stuff like pin placement is not the same.  Very few semiconductor chips are fungible.  The only ones that are that really come to mind is RAM but even then it's the DIMMs that are, not the chips themselves.  You would need to redesign to accept the new off the shelf parts and redo a lot of your integration work which may also include software.  It effectively becomes a light version of a new weapons program.

&gt;Again, given that existing military applications are most likely running decades old technology already, I doubt that this would be of much concern.

It is since the they are some of the last remaining customers on those process nodes, once other demand dries up it is no longer economical to run those factories and they retool.  There is a massive issue within DoD acquisition of systems not having the ability to source new components and whatever is in stockpile is it forever.  This can be seen with stinger missiles right now.  DoD has failed to put measures in place to either keep enough business to keep those production lines available or transition systems to newer process nodes.  Any new weapons system with mandates for a US only supply base is limited by what can be supplied by domestic industry.",6f416ca2b4dc247ae0053feb04ebbc28e388b516,True,False,,,,,0,1654814186,,0,{},ibsd569,False,t3_v4twqt,False,True,t1_ib68q7p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4twqt/can_russia_rebuild_its_tech_sector_with_chinas/ibsd569/,1654814198,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654785386.0

[],False,,passabagi,,,[],,,,text,t2_82a7volb,False,False,"&gt; The US military in particulate tries to limit collateral damage as both a choice of military doctrine as well as political concerns

I don't think the US military could be called a world leader when it comes to limiting collateral damage. For example, most countries have banned the use of cluster bombs. The US has not, and uses them extensively.  Admittedly, their use has been in decline, but they are by their very nature extremely indiscriminate, especially once the conflict is over. 

I think the picture I've been getting through this thread is essentially that the US at the time of Desert Storm, probably was just about as indiscriminate as the Russians are, just because of the heavy use of unguided aerial bombing. 

The US military has also continued to be indiscriminate in some cases: to my eyes, Mosul looks somewhat more destroyed than Mariupol, Raqqa looks less. 

I think it's really hard to straightforwardly compare, too. In Desert Storm, Iraq was a pretty good stand-in in terms of capability to Ukraine today. So that's the war that makes sense as a point of comparison, not the wars of the GWOT.  On the other hand, the availability of precision guided weapons was much less.

One thing I would note is you're hypothesizing a lot about internal discussions going on in the Russian military, and we actually have no idea. We just see the results. I'm not sure, in the end, it matters whether restraint was advised, then decided against, if it still results in your city lying in ruins. 

The metaphor in my mind would be the anti personnel butterfly mines dropped on Ukraine. They get a lot of attention because they look like toys, kill people for decades after the conflict, and are banned in almost every country in the world. Left unmentioned is the fact the design is a clone of an American one, used in Vietnam. Left unmentioned is that the two major countries not signatory to the Ottawa convention[0] that banned these things, are Russia, and the USA. The point is not that everybody is equally bad, the point is, if you want to make an anti-personnel mine, there's an optimal shape for that kind of thing, and if you want to increase attrition on insurgent forces, dropping anti-personnel mines is a good strategy. That's why both the US, and the USSR, used them extensively in a similar scenario (Vietnam, Afghanistan respectively).

[0]: Although, for an extra piece of hypocrisy, you'll notice that most of the europeans that have banned these things are in NATO, so in a big war, the Ottawa convention would be basically irrelevant anyway.",86da78782e01295260c55ffd8fd68bd8b6d6f108,True,False,,,,,0,1654810810,,0,{},ibs5tfr,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t1_ibrof2d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibs5tfr/,1654810829,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654782010.0

Foreign volunteers themselves aren’t always mercenaries, but if they are paid more than native soldiers, then it’s a problem. Ukrainian volunteers seem to be just shy of the legal definition of a mercenary, thanks mainly to Ukrainians getting a pay raise right before they really started recruiting from abroad. 

If the volunteers are getting paid from multiple sources, if they are getting paid more than claimed, or the Ukrainians aren’t getting all the pay that’s due them yet, then I don’t see how the Geneva convention definition doesn’t apply here. The western offers to pay people to go fight in Ukraine may be making mercenaries out of people. Monetizing ones experience on social media is probably could also be an issue.

I understand the sentiment, but how many of these systmes can the west realistically send?

1. Countries must retain units for their own needs. It would be ludicrous for NATO to empty its arsenals for ukraine and leave ourselves entirely without numerous advanced weapons systems, even in the short term.

2. Given they're quite specialised, I'm assuming that most countries have very limited stocks of such systems in the first place.

Quad copters and fixed wing UAVs in this class aren't really substitutes for each other. There's advantages either way as people have pointed out. A big advantage of quad copters is how they're launched and recovered. In fact with fixed wing systems like ScanEagle the trend now is to launch and recover by using a quad copter as a sort of tow vehicle.

The real enablers for the drone craze, if you want to call it that, are cheap GPS+INS flight computers, high quality small form factor sensors sourcable from the vast mobile device ecosystem, ISM band modulation protocols that can send a HD video feed, and lastly lion batteries good enough you can have a pure electric drone with useful endurance.",50b937766c286e71070b6b00e2a3076821925cf9,True,False,,,,,0,1654809226,,0,{},ibs2a1k,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t1_ibpdu1q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibs2a1k/,1654809239,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654780426.0

A short update tweet on where we are on the 🇷🇺🇺🇦 war. A lot to do for @ecfr, and our next #twitterspace will be about different things ... so here wer are.
Last week 🇷🇺 repaired the railway connection into #Izyum and you immediately see the results.

2/ Further offensives from Izyum towards #Sloviansk are expected in the comming days. This will make 🇺🇦 positions in #Severodonestk even more vulnerable.
Renewed 🇷🇺 attacks on #Bakhmut were repelled so far, but breakthroughs may happen any day. Any of them will force ...

3/ 🇺🇦 to retreat to the #Sloviansk - #Kramatorsk line. When this happens is hard to predict, but it can happen by tomorrow. A lot of prepared positions there, so this again should hold up 🇷🇺 for weeks.

4/ Why then is 🇺🇦 fighting for Severodonestk? Urban terrain favours the defender, and also #Lysychansk would offer strong defensive positions.
Ukrainians are inferior in firepower and mobility due to the lack of heavy weapons, but have more infantry. Throwing infantry ...

5/ at an armoured enemy is a meat-grinder, unless you have the terrain to get your men close enough, and provide cover enough to make them engage the tanks. Urban terrain is the classic, so if you can force the enemy to fight there, you stand better chances.

6/ That of course only works if 🇷🇺 cannot circumvent your positions. So they need to contain the Popasna- bulge, which is much more difficult than defending Lysychansk.
I would expect 🇺🇦 to be thrown back to the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk line by July. Let's see.

7/ Where does this put us in the overall war effort? Again, this is a long war of attrition, small, incremental 🇷🇺 gains are not the issue, but rather who erodes the other faster?
Russians employ concentrated artillery to substitute (lacking) infantry &amp; airpower.

8/ While I don't see much effect on materiel losses (caveat: it takes more time to count them), effect on morale and losses in 🇺🇦 menpower become visible. This is a worrying trend.
Second, after #Mariupol 🇷🇺 seem to have regained some motivation and faith ...

9/ in their commanders to be able to achieve victory. This should not be underestimated.
Situation for 🇺🇦 looks bleaker than in April/May. Particularly, because Western arms deliveries are slower and remain fewer than expected.

10/ Suicide drones (#Switchblade, etc.) can supplement but not sustitute artillery. Quantity has a quality of its own, and 🇷🇺 has large quantities of artillery.
🇺🇦 in contrast suffers from shortages of ammunition and transport capability to get ammunition to the front in time.

11/ 🇷🇺 missile/cruise missile campaign against 🇺🇦 defence industry paid off, althoough it had cost Moscow most of its arsenal.
Western artillery like #m777 and #CAESAR are excellent systems, but short of the quantity 🇺🇦 needs.

12/ 🇺🇸 #HIMARS will only come in symbolic numbers, as will 🇩🇪 #PzH2000.
Ukraine's heavy MLRS were 70 BM-27 Urgan &amp; 81 BM-30 Smerch, all of which run short on munitions (factories destroyed) and need to be replaced.
They are crucially important to provide counter-battery fire...

13/ ... into the Russian rear.
Then, 🇺🇦 has few OTR-21 Tochka left, but such things would be needed to attack 🇷🇺 railway lines.
🇺🇸 decision not to supply #ATACMS for fearing strikes into Russia was a mistake. I hope it will be corrected.

14/ I wrote in previous tweets that 🇺🇦 has the chance to stem the tide once mobilised forces have sufficient training. That still holds true, but only if they also get the firepower and mobility needed to prevail against 🇷🇺 forces.

15/ That means MBT, IFV, artillery, air-defence. 🇺🇦 can only get this in the West, and in most cases only get Western systems.
But we are much too slow and too reluctant to deliver. These systems need time to train people and build up a chain of supply.

16/ Hence decisions should have been made already to have effect in summer/authumn. We waste precious time, both in Washington, Berlin, Paris, ... name it.

US rules of engagement at the theater level allowed us to engage enemy based not on signs of weaponry but on ""Hostile Intent"" and ""Hostile Action"", in terms of the threat they posed to us, our allies, civilians, infrastructure, etc. 

We knew that insurgent spotters routinely flouted existing ROEs because they were unarmed. And we also knew they were spotting us, either directing fires, gathering intel, etc. Together that gave us enough reasonable confidence to consider certain actions as hostile intent, such as filming us with cameras, watching us with binoculars, etc. That didn't mean those individuals were shot on sight, but it was enough to start a conversation to have more senior individuals in the unit, at least an NCO if not an officer in a command slot, check out the situation or give a ruling that was the green light to engage them. 

In certain circumstances we could also engage people digging into the side of roads or messing around in trash piles, as that could be an indication of emplacing IEDs. 

Overall, the decision was based on junior leadership's judgement as it applied to our commander's intent: we were supposed to be focused on Counter Insurgency, with a key tenet being avoidance of unnecessary collateral damage, to win hearts and minds, and to not make enemies by trying to kill people that we didn't need to.  

However, it was a gray area of legality, which (and sometimes was) easily abused by the occasional psychopath just looking for any excuse to smoke someone.

In every US combat command from brigade/regiment and up, there is a Judge Advocate General military lawyer who is there to advise the commander on Laws Of Armed Conflict (LOAC) issues. 

Often times, their opinions are considered in every single airstrike or use of artillery, especially unobserved fires. In certain circumstances, commanders aren't even allow to authorize heavy fires without getting JAG approval of the legality. Whenever the situation was gray during the GWOT, especially after 2010 in Afghanistan, the commanders usually weighed on the side of cautiousness, sometimes to the detriment of the local commands who faced the negative repercussions of having fires denied (like the Battle of Ganjgal). 

Occasionally, heavy fires were still used despite threat to collateral damage, usually because the mission required it and there was no way around it. To get that, sometimes, commanders had to go up their chain of command to get permission from higher. That included needing Trump to authorize loosening of ROE for the war against ISIS, where urban battles like in Mosul and Raqqa had been previously treated with ""kid gloves"" but then with a more heavy handed approach, which led to much more collateral damage but also quicker outcomes and less casualties to friendly military ground units. 

But I'd put it this way: I seriously doubt there is a similar structure in the Russian military. I doubt they give a shit enough to bother with that, or even doctrinally believe collateral damage is problematic. The US military in particulate tries to limit collateral damage as both a choice of military doctrine as well as political concerns, both of which balance each other out. The Russian military believe collateral damage is often times outright advantageous, and their civilian leadership are far less concerned with the political ramifications, often being the ones pressing for less restraint.",53b08a82a382620ebc7c99a968015a27f64cc0fc,True,False,,,,,0,1654803255,,0,{},ibrof2d,False,t3_v61vzb,False,False,t1_ibeku03,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibrof2d/,1654803273,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654774455.0

How objectives are achieved are very clearly set by politicians. You can see this in lengthy ROE documents that lawyers and commanders struggle to fit onto a postcard understandable by an infantryman in a foxhole while getting shot at. 

Using WWII as an example is another absurdity. Even Russia isn't using wwii tactics in its invasion, we certainly couldn't and even if policy makers wanted to I doubt the military would follow such orders for example ""morale bombing""

Giving Iraq and Afghanistan as examples of military defeats is another reason I can't take this guy seriously. Politicians were deeply involved in the conduct of those ""wars"" and blaming the military for the political decision to pull out is not a credible argument.

&gt; * Technically speaking, as soon as a user in a war zone picks up a smartphone to assist the army, both the technology and the individual could be considered sensors, or nodes, in the practice known as ISR—intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Inviting citizens to become a potential element in a military system, as the e-Enemy feature does, might blur the lines between civilian and combatant activity.

Why would volunteers operating at the platoon level and below know anything solid about TDF foreign legion manning levels? 

Plus, cite? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;None of which included foreign fighters.

I'd not claimed they did. I claimed there is a morale boost for when troops know they wont get the shaft if they're captured. As of latest, foreign troops had a vague understanding of what would happen. Vague because it was all talk, no action. If these guys are actually executed, that isn't just action, that is policy. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, I've read the telegrams - the Ukrainian army generally holds a low opinion on what happens to people who get captured by the Russians. If you do go back you might not do so in one piece.

Considering only three exchanges occurred with low numbers in all of them, that's understandable. But the Russians are exchanging those Ukraine troops, they're not trying and executing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I have to reiterate that I feel like the primary product of risking your life in combat is death or wounding in combat. Feels like that's the primary concern, what happens if you surrender is the secondary.

I don't agree. And I'm not opinionating on what I think combat troops think of, I was an infantryman for 11 years and served in combat. 

Where I had an active plan to hold a fragmentation grenade against my own head if the time ever came that AQI would somehow get me alive. In fact, one of them was purely reserved for that role. And I was far from the only one who considered options like saving a frag for myself or kept an extra bullet or whole mag meant only for themselves. 

And we had those plans because we thought about it, despite there being no serious threat of it happening. Our morale was high and the fear of that outcome never overcame our abilities to fight effectively was knowing the situations and conditions were never bad enough that our capture was likely. While also knowing every means would be taken by the US military to get us back. 

During the GWOT, a DUSTWUN (duty status: whereabouts unknown) report triggered an immediate halt of **every single ongoing combat op in theater**, to shift all resources to finding the missing servicemember. Every inch of every base was searched, and all resources were pulled to be devoted to searching outside the wire with hastily concocted tactical ops. 

Hell, one reason the battle of Kamdesh happened was it took so long to close that COP down because they couldn't arrange the helicopters because, despite it having happened five months earlier, RC-E was still using them to try to find Bergdahl after he Kerouac'd off his COP like a fucking dumbass. 

But that was the realities of GWOT only for the US and a few other privileged allies. Even our Iraqi and Afghan military allies had it nowhere as good as we did (which is why they were often far more flighty). But that was nothing as brutal as this war in Ukraine, when being captured is routine, where mass surrenders occur, when 60-100 KIA/day is normal in one theater, where entire battalions are written off by the brass with ease as the cost of doing business, and casualties have to be regularly abandoned on the field, dead and wounded alike. 

The US hasn't fought a legit war with those conditions since Korea, namely in 1950-1. And when we did, US troops performed rather poorly, morale was low, and the ""Bug Out Blues"" were the norm, as US Army units in particular felt their flanks were threatened that often triggered an unplanned retreat or outright rout, to avoid being captured by Korean or Chinese troops, especially in 1950 when the KPA was regularly summarily executing US troops on the spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I feel like your ""bet"" regarding how fuzzy people feel about being captured isn't necessarily accurate.

If an actual Ukrainian serving in an actual Ukraine military gets captured they might have it bad, though they might be exchanged within days or weeks. Whatever happens, there is no proof at all they will be executed after a show trial, which is what seems to point as being the only outcome to foreign volunteers. 

In that deal, the foreign volunteers (certain ""nazi"" militia) got fucked hard. And in comparison, the regular Ukraine troops have it pretty good. AKA, warm and fuzzy.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A lot of times you remind me of that.

Because it often falls on me to plug reality into the discussion. Which is itself a problem, if the discussion swings so much that simplistic ""truisms"" need to be injected just to keep the discussion framed in reality, what would it be like without it?  

This sub in particular is filled with people who love discussing warfare but with few actually understanding it, let alone having ever experienced it to add that context. Not a bad problem if they're flexible in their opinions and willing to learn. Very bad if those people have rigid opinions and think they learned everything they need to learn. 

If this discussion were about sex instead of war it would be a bunch of virgins, who also never learned anything outside of what they watched in porn, trying to give their opinions on the subject, all while a frustrated lifelong cocksman reads in dismay, trying to occasionally correct and provide pointers without being rude, patronizing, or condescending.

https://t\*me/romanov\_92/18438

(DeepL translation)  


&gt;Exclusive material about the mopping up of the village of Dolgenkoye on the Izyum front from a direct participant in the assault.  
On May 16, the assault operation began. Volunteers were tasked with supporting the attack by a company of the Russian Armed Forces on Ukrainian positions. Instead of a company, there were 20 infantrymen, four BMPs and one tank in the village. A Russian army colonel greeted the reinforcements: ""Well done guys, I'm glad you came. He waved his hand and said: ""let's go, let's attack"". The assault began.  
One BMP-1AM ""Basurmanin"" went into battle, behind which all the infantry was sheltered. Ahead was a field, and behind it appeared a building and a landing where the enemy was. ""The Basurmanin, reaching the middle of the field, moved sharply to the right and exposed the infantry. The AFU positions were in the front and to the left. About 30 infantrymen found themselves in a firing bag. Dense shelling began, and all the infantry on the right flank rearranged into a ""reverse horseshoe."" A volunteer machine gunner begins to return fire, but after three bursts notices the fighters falling to the ground and follows suit. Taking cover behind a hill and assessing the situation, he begins working his way home with the enemy.  
At the same time another volunteer, together with two soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, tries to infiltrate through the planting in the direction of the building where the Ukrainian armed forces are entrenched. A BMP is sent to their aid, but its crew was unable to locate the Ukrainian soldiers, so they came up with nothing better than to fire on their own soldiers walking at the edge of the landing. Then the events that we have described before take place. The volunteer successfully survived the shelling of his BMP and destroyed two AFU soldiers with fire.  
The machine gunner behind the hill continues to work on the house, the roof and countering the sniper. A Ukrainian runs out from behind the house on the left, fires a grenade launcher at the machine gunner, but misses, and is immediately killed by return fire.   
The other two Russian fighters go into a plantation, where they run into an AFU soldier, one wounded in the arm and the other in the leg, but the latter manages to destroy the enemy.    
By this time, the agreed plan of attack had ceased to exist, and the battle had degenerated into a series of individual skirmishes. The tank had not even begun to work on the AFU positions, and the BMP distinguished itself only by firing on its own. Another BMP, which had left the field for the right flank at the start of the battle, returned and began to cover the collection of the wounded in the small arms battle. A medic covered the area with smoke from three grenades and the wounded began to be carried off the battlefield. A volunteer machine-gunner who survived the RPG fire put tourniquets on two RAF soldiers, bandaged their commander and returned to the fight.  
The volunteer from the landing continued to run normally in spite of his shot leg. He applied a pressure bandage to himself, removed a bloody tourniquet and bandaged another soldier with it. In the meantime, the battle continued and for now the outcome was not clear to the participants. By the middle of the battle, the AFU began to cover the field with mortars and 152 or 155 mm artillery began to work along the line of withdrawal. The wounded commander, who had been left without his personal weapon during the battle, was given a grenade to blow himself up in case of an accident.  
The machine gunner was already firing off his last boxes and was wounded, which he only noticed after the battle. Finally, a tank decided to take part in the fight and drove out of cover and started working on the building. It wasn't much use, as most of the enemy soldiers at that position had already been in a small arms battle.  
By this point the battle began to fade, our infantry had pulled back from the mortar-strewn field and began regrouping. We took turns covering the body of the dead cow, which was the only cover in the whole field.   
One volunteer and two soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces were killed in the battle. All other infantrymen were wounded. The AFU lost 10 soldiers killed.  
Among the volunteers were participants in conflicts in Donbas, Syria, Libya and even Chechnya, but none had taken part in such dense assaults. As the fighters themselves say, they survived and won only because of the individual training of each fighter and the availability of sighting equipment.",67aed187ffac0434b7479bafa9e63443b2172395,True,False,,,,,0,1654798528,,0,{},ibrdfwr,False,t3_v8f8u1,False,True,t3_v8f8u1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v8f8u1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_09_2022/ibrdfwr/,1654798543,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654769728.0

However, operational art will always be the core of the purpose of a war college. Other material should exist to serve that goal, not for its own sake. The entire study of international affairs is infested by people with the fundamental view that, as the article quotes, ""war is icky."" The twitter response posted by OP is extraordinarily emblematic of this: ""There is a definite divide within military history. This article represents the old school thinking of divorcing war from politics and society. They think war is just arrows on a map. Please don't lump all of us in with this toxic lot."" The mere usage of the word ""toxic"" should alert the reader to the issues of this take. More importantly, it is also absurd to classify the study of war into ""old"" and ""new"" thinking, as if those who got their PhD before 1975 were unaware that warfare had political and social elements.  

While it is critical that the reaction to this phenomenon not remove all instruction on the political elements of war, I am very skeptical of those who insist the prosecution of war involves \*just so many other\* aspects than actual battlefield decision making.

None of which included foreign fighters.  At least, not from the Ukrainian side.  Also, I've read the telegrams - the Ukrainian army generally holds a low opinion on what happens to people who get captured by the Russians.  If you do go back you might not do so in one piece.

Combined with the fact that Russians already said they'll execute foreign POWs I feel like your ""bet"" regarding how fuzzy people feel about being captured isn't necessarily accurate.

&gt;UAF troops now sleep better at night and are more willing to risk their lives in combat

I have to reiterate that I feel like the primary product of risking your life in combat is death or wounding in combat.  Feels like that's the primary concern, what happens if you surrender is the secondary.

&gt;If you don't think that plays a major part in morale, go sign up for the TDF yourself and see how it feels.

The whole getting blown up by rockets and artillery thing would be the primary deterrent personally, if we're now getting personal.  (That and no relevant skillsets)

&gt;AFTER that happens one can start judging the morale of foreign troops over this topic. Not only will the actual executions play a major part in how the troops think and act afterwards, but so will how they interpret actions from the Ukrainians they are helping. Will the Zelensky govt respond in a meaningful way that motivates the foreign volunteers?

They're from Britain but they're not really foreign volunteers anymore, you seem to be bringing that up so I thought I'd clarify.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;it gives the UK a reason to be mad

If they're legit Ukraine citizens then there is even less chance the British govt does anything to save them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Firstly, especially after that one missile bombing of the foreign volunteer base in Lviv, I think the foreign volunteers left in Ukraine understand the prospect of death pretty clearly

Nobody has any way of knowing that, which was why I listed two possibilities and didn't outright declare one was going to happen.

Even if someone where to have served in foreign legion TDF they couldn't accurately judge the morale everyone, only in the units they served in or observed personally. The rest would be hearsay and largely bullshit.

To have an inkling of an accurate opinion on this matter would require correspondence across the spectrum of foreign legion TDF units, which you don't have access to, or else an imaginary poll done by the UAF asking foreign volunteers questions about morale, which doesn't exist.

And even then, if you had access to either they'd not be accurate because this topic was all just talk until the trial occurred and the executions are done. Foreign volunteers heard the threats from Russia, but actions are louder than words. If the executions occur, that is action, and that is their new reality. Morale changes afterwards.

AFTER that happens one can start judging the morale of foreign troops over this topic. Not only will the actual executions play a major part in how the troops think and act afterwards, but so will how they interpret actions from the Ukrainians they are helping. Will the Zelensky govt respond in a meaningful way that motivates the foreign volunteers? Will senior officers from the UAF and TDF make their way down to those units and give rousing speeches that fire them up? Will they even be offered the chance to go home now that things have changed for them? Etc.

All of that matters, because morale isn't constant and its not defined by a single thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Like the people who haven't deserted after months of getting bombarded aren't going to start now that they know the Russians aren't going to treat them as guests of honor if they surrender, which they probably suspected anyway.

You're not considering other factors such as the large number of prisoner exchanges done already. Those happened and I bet a whole lot of UAF troops now sleep better at night and are more willing to risk their lives in combat knowing that being captured isn't a death sentence or major hardship, and that they might not even have to spend a long time in captivity. Meanwhile, what will the foreign legion troops know? Capture=death sentence.

If you don't think that plays a major part in morale, go sign up for the TDF yourself and see how it feels.

If their morale remains high that might just mean they'll largely fight harder not to be captured, and to the death. But if their morale drops for various reasons, none of which you've considered, it will mean they will avoid the situations that can cause them to be captured. To include drastic steps like desertion. Or more so, not signing up in the first place.

A great example of what I'm talking about is the Iraqi Army versus the US Army when it came to the threat of fighting AQI/ISI/ISIS/DAESH.

The situation in Ukraine with respect to Crimea actually provides an interesting - though I would agree it's not identical - parallel. Crimea was taken by Russia in 2014 and it had a supposed ""referendum"" to join the Russian Federation. This referendum was not accepted by Ukraine, the West, or most of the world. But let's say this situation carries on for another 80 years, and Russia remains in control of Crimea. By then, generations have grown up in Crimea, who see themselves as Russian. Does that then mean Ukraine should give up all claims of Crimea because it no longer makes any sense to contest it, now that they have their own identity?

*Feedback On French Navy High Intensity Exercise POLARIS*

In a report published by the French Parliament's National Defense and Armed Forces Committee, members of parliament (MPs) review the French Navy (Marine Nationale)'s feedback on the high-intensity exercise 'POLARIS' conducted from November 18 to December 3, 2021.

https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/05/feedback-on-french-navy-high-intensity-exercise-polaris/

&gt; * After the first minutes of combat, it turns out that the result is severe, and this is what the report underlines. In fact, within fifteen minutes of combat, two frigates were sunk and two more were neutralized. 200 to 400 sailors were put out of action, killed or missing. But the result was even worse at the end of the exercise, with a total of eight ships sunk or out of combat.

&gt; * Beyond the lack of ships and aircraft, the report shows that the POLARIS exercise highlighted “the inadequacy of protection at sea for French ships”, but also “the inadequacy of the Exocet missile compared with other more modern missiles” and that it is urgent to remedy this. Although the Franco-British programme of future anti-ship and cruise missiles – FC/ASW program – should fix this gap, it will not be completed until around 2030.

&gt; * “The cooperation with the British has so far been hampered by divergent military-technical analyses and industrial interests. Simulations carried out by the Navy and the DGA in the field of anti-surface warfare show that stealth, so much vaunted by the British, cannot by itself make a real difference in naval combat. The stealthy anti-ship missile is indeed detectable as soon as it passes the horizon, even low over the water. High speed and maneuverability, on the other hand, are far more credible factors for operational superiority and lethality.”

&gt; * Finally, the feedback from the POLARIS exercise once again showed general lack of ammunition for all kinds of weapons.

Severodonetsk is the last part of Luhansk oblast still under Ukrainian control. As I noted though, Ukraine abandoned most of what it still held after 2014 at the outset of this conflict without a fight as it was indefensible. Losing Severodonetsk means losing all of Luhansk, which really isn't a huge deal in the overall conflict.

How is saying ""time is on Ukraine's side"" viewing things through rose colored glasses? That's my personal opinion of the situation, one backed by many analysts including Michael Kofman and Rob Lee.

I wasn't really thinking about this on an individual level since this decision was made centrally I suspect.

My point was as a nation, even one like Russia which doesn't **really** care too much about reputation, you still want to stray away from admitting to war crimes too often.  And announcing in no uncertain terms on your own tv station ""haha I will go crime a war now"" doesn't do that.

And as a fighting side in a conflict, I'd say executing prisoners during a war is a net negative, a severe net negative, really.

Ultimately I generally think of this war at the level of governments, so that's my take.

But for fun, I can conjecture about the individuals involved.  We can take the MH17 shootdown (as well as the various war crimes on the ground during the Donbas conflict) as an example.  A lot of these separatists are nationalists and as such they'll say being wanted for war crimes in the west doesn't bother them, but that's not actually true.  You see, vacation destinations inside Russia kinda blow, and so being confined to Russia for the rest of your life isn't for everyone.

It's why one (or two?) of the people held responsible for the MH 17 shootdown went on vacation in a western state (Greece I think) and got nabbed by police and sent to the Hague.  Unfortunately, Ukraine asked they get traded back as part of a prisoner exchange, which I still maintain was a bad idea, but whatever.

&gt;Will UA or someone else use targeted strikes to kill them instead?

First off, those missiles have 200lb of explosive...one missile is a small airstrike. Neither side can drop airstrikes regularly behind enemy lines except with cruise and ballistic missiles. 

However Ukraine has comparatively few tochk-Us so this would be a massive increase in available powerful fires for them. They simply have nothing which would be comparable in potential destruction plentifully available. Firing say 12 GMLRS (2 HIMAR) would also likely be more effective at eliminating dispersed Russian units than firing a single tochka-U...and unlike Tochka-U, these platforms can move much faster making it harder to be taken out by Iskanders which Russia has been shown to utilize to destroy long range Ukrainian MLRS.

If provided with a sufficient number and with plentiful rockets I think they will make a bigger difference than widely discussed. Even 40 would be a massive increase in available fires both of that level of lethality and at a wider selection of targets.

I know Ukraine and Russia have Uragan/Smerch but these systems have seemingly been relying on inaccurate large area of effect munitions. Ukraine also has relatively few Smerch and almost certainly not very much ammo available for either platform.

&gt;On the ground level, it also discourages foreign mercenaries from surrendering under any circumstances. 

Potentially yes. But it might also trigger mass desertions in TDF but more so cause future foreign volunteer recruiting shortfalls.

Being a foreign volunteer seemed awesome watching the Phase 1 of the war. #Slavaukraini was trending at an all time high. News reports and combat footage were mostly of ambushing Russian columns, balanced out with nonstop summaries about how incompetent they were. Hell, even I wanted to join up too. That was a period some historians call ""victory disease, "" and it's a great time for recruitment. 

But the reality now is TDF light infantry are sent repeatedly into meat grinder artillery battles against a resurgent Russian military who seem to have better capabilities and are achieving successes while causing massive casualties. Some foreign volunteer vets who got back home are publicly describing their service and aren't super positive about serving under the Ukrainians. There are complaints as to why poorly armed, organized, and led TDF units are at the tip of the spear when legit UAF units with better capabilities are in quieter sectors. 

That's already a bummer, and you can feel the negative vibes here too in this sub. But knowing that if a potential foreign volunteer recruit is captured that they'll be executed will probably be the deciding factor to sign up. Especially depending on how Zelensky reacts. If he doesn't go beserk trying to defend his foreign volunteers that'll be tantamount to betrayal.

Easy. By blowing up the chinese planes, sinking the chinese ships, and cutting off all trade. Then the Chinese economy collapses and China can't afford to wage war anymore.

A CCP invasion of Taiwan would not be a civil war. It would be 1 country attacking another independent country.

The Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, 73 years ago.

The CCP lost and failed without any US intervention.

Don't try to act like if it wasn't for the US, the CCP could have finished the job. They could not have. The role the US played later was to just stop them from even considering trying with shows of force.

Not to mention - most countries haven't cut economic ties with Russia! Central/South America, Africa, and the Middle East have all resisted or outright done nothing. Even our ""allies"" in the Middle East aren't willing to increase oil production to help offset the effects of Russian oil sanctions - and China's got even deeper ties with many of those parts of the world

Much like the US didn't get sanctioned for its various foreign policy actions over the past couple of decades, China can grow too big for others to be willing to sanction a country that can make the argument that a China versus Taiwan fight is merely the conclusion of its civil war.

And there's going to be a lot more countries standing on the side in fear that they piss off someone who might be the winner if it comes to blows between the US and China.

It's accurate. It is, indeed ""less kinetic"" because it is passive.

&gt; I struggle to imagine that China mining Hawaii or the US West Coast wouldn’t provoke a violent conflict. 

That's different. I'm sure self-serving Chinese don't think so, but it should be obvious why. There are no other countries anywhere near Hawaii or the US coast. Mining in the Taiwan strait has a defensive character that does not exist if you try to mine San Francisco. 

&gt;I also imagine an early Chinese move in a crisis would be to declare a no fly zone over the Taiwan Straits. It’s off their coast, handily in range of SAMs and fighter aircraft. This hypothetical crisis minelaying mission seems likely to need the whole mess of escorts, jammers, SEAD, and so on.

Wrong. The minefield is already laid in a single mission before China knows it's happened. It is then announced that the Strait is mined, which shuts down all traffic through the Strait. What does this supposed ""no fly zone"" which really means ""we will attack any aircraft far beyond our territorial airspace"" accomplish at that point? nothing. 

Although there is no need for the US to fight an air war, it is laughable that you think Chinese Su27s could fight F35s and it be anything other than a turkey shoot in America's favor. SAMs are irrelevant, as there is no need for the US to get anywhere near close enough to be possibly detected. 

&gt;seems like a great way to put the US into the USSR’s Cuban shoes rather than the opposite.

One of rare good things about Ukrainian justice system — pro bono criminal attorneys are generally independent and do their work diligently. In Russia they are part of the pipeline and play on the side of prosecution and law enforcement, barely protecting an accused or even sabotaging the defense. If you try to hire an independent lawyer in Russia, he is often prevented from doing his job.

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"This gets into the wider question of what a Taiwan war looks like, which is badly understood in the media. Most people assume the PLA will bum rush on the beaches and if they’re turned back it’s over. That’s plan B for them, if that - there are Chinese invasion plans and drills, but to say they’re half asses is an understatement. China can lift 3-4 brigades at a time, but a country with that industrial capacity *could* easily have created the capacity to lift an order of magnitude more if they wanted to. They don’t, because the PLA knows the ROC army is not the center of gravity in a Western Pacific War - the *US Navy* is.

The fate of Taiwan is not going to be decided on the breaches of the island, but in the seven seas. The US navy can simply cut off Chinese oil imports, and even with that country’s immense strategic oil reserve and its new pipelines, it’ll only be able to survive for a year or two under harsh rationing. That’s not enough time even for the world factory to turn out sufficient ship numbers to defeat the US navy. The Chinese basically have two options - first is defeat the USN in detail by sinking the three carriers currently in the pacific then waiting for the other eight in bite size chunks. Obviously this has a number of problems. First while China can expect air supremacy in its littoral, including Taiwan, the USN is wise to this and base all of its Pacific carriers well out of range of most of China’s jets. Second even if they did YOLO the Pacific fleet into the Taiwan strait, the other 8 carriers are not making the same mistake. In effect this option… isn’t.

The second option is political - they need to use Americans’ widely inaccurate perceptions of the balance of power to their advantage, and deliver a blow great enough that the US agrees to make peace. This is rests on a number of assumptions. However it is the only option, so that’s what PRC defense policy has revolved around for more than a decade. The PRC assumes any Taiwan conflict will be started by the other side, because it doesn’t get a win condition if it’s the aggressor. Once this happens they will need to inflict enough losses on the US before the oil runs out to convince the American public to demand peace - even a status quo peace.

All the while the they are building towards their real “win condition”, namely by conducting the largest and fastest naval buildup in history. They are extremely paranoid that the US is going to launch a preemptive attack, or will dovetail the Taiwan situation into a casus belli, before they’re ready. In 2020 there were two war scares - one where China threatened to shoot down Trump’s UN representative en route to Taiwan unless she turned around (she did, and the incident was swept under the rug with the excuse that Trump “wanted to make Biden’s transition easier”), and another, better known incident where the PLA went on high alert expecting a preemptive attack until the American JSC chief called them and assured them there were no such plans. Basically China views Taiwan as an extension of its conflict with the US, and sees the island as a tool that the US is using to provoke a war. This isn’t what’s happening, but it makes sense in light of China’s history.

As for what China’s defeat condition is, recognition of Taiwan independence is that. They are fine with the status quo and are convinced they’ll be able to reintegrate Taiwan through sanctions eventually. In any war, they are essentially just fighting for the status quo and resumption of trade, and they will try to do this by making American blockade costly.",42a02614ac5007469832fc1447de4b18e76a776c,True,False,,,,,0,1654786727,,0,{},ibqlf50,False,t3_v7t8hx,False,True,t1_ibnzhlb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7t8hx/an_offensive_minelaying_campaign_against_china/ibqlf50/,1654786742,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654757927.0

No. There aren't any viable diplomatic solutions right now, and there won't be any until one side suffers a decisive military defeat. Most of the people calling for diplomatic resolution are trying to arrange that the Ukrainian side is the one that suffers the defeat.

The Ukrainian perspective on the war is that Russia attacked them in 2014, they gave up portions of their country, and Russia came back later to take more of their country. The basic expectation in wars between Russia and Ukraine is that Russia should win, but Russia is doing poorly this war, and Ukraine is doing well. Therefore, Ukraine is going all in on this war, because peace would just allow Russia to reset, fix their issues, and try again at a time more favorable to Russia.

The Russian perspective is that they have already suffered all the sanctions and international loss of goodwill that starting a war causes. So they might as well keep going and get as many of the benefits of the war as they can.

Since neither side is ready for peace, there will be no peace for a while.

2. Most donated towed artillery from the wests comes with trucks to tow it, I'm sure trucks are provided relatively liberally as Ukraine requests.

Frankly?  I think Ukraine's amount of light material transport vehicles is probably sufficient (like, there's gotta be plenty of toyotas and vans in Ukraine if it comes down to it).  I suspect their logistics challenges are:

a) fuel

b) armored transports

c) management


3. more or less correct.  Part of the reason is they're limited in this regard is that any attempt of carpet gravity bombing of an area from high-altitude bombers would result in severe attrition due to Ukrainian s-300s.  Russia is clearly not interested in suffering that attrition.

4. An interesting observation.  To be honest we knew ahead of time Ukraine's air force was underpowered by most standards (if anything, it exceeded expectations, both ours and Russia's).  We hadn't ever bothered to fix that because - and this is an important thing to understand - unlike what the Kremlin suggests, Ukraine wasn't our ally, they were at best a friendly nation.  We weren't interested in spending the significant money or escalating, when it came to upgrading their air force.

Ukraine's anti-air forces are on paper actually reasonable.  It's why Russian air support left Kyiv after the first week or two.  However, they have a lot of ground to cover and we (for the same reason as planes) never gave them any of our anti-air units.  Plus, the geography of the Donbas fight means Ukraine's heavy anti-air units are basically absent.  

5. No clue, but the fact that far more effort has been made to transfer Ukraine to the 155mm standard is indicative that this prospect may be unrealistic.

Though it's worth saying that the current amount of 155mm tubes being donated by the west (while not small) is about 1 third of what Ukraine would actually need to transfer over.",01adc310ce9ac3bdc68a86ba816218ef931963af,True,False,,,,,0,1654780026,,0,{},ibq77b5,False,t3_v8f8u1,False,True,t1_ibq4snr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v8f8u1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_09_2022/ibq77b5/,1654780037,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654751226.0

------------------

&gt; * Russia’s professional military education ceased taking the study of war seriously. The supposed experts of the new forms of war—hybrid warfare, conducted in the gray zone by little green men, with heavy doses of cyber and information operations—have forgotten how to execute more traditional forms of war.

&gt; * The problem is, at the operational level of war, how do these planners know that going to Point Y is the correct answer? Here, at the higher levels of warfare, PME is failing—specifically at the war college level, but also in other PME schools that have some responsibility for teaching how to think about war. 

&gt; * Except for scattered small pockets of specialized classes, the war colleges have deemphasized teaching the art and science of war in favor of delving deep into the realms of policy, grand strategy, sociocultural studies, and a host of other topics that are irrelevant to the actual conduct of war at the theater or multi-theater level. 

&gt; * …the war colleges have less than a year to educate students in war’s higher operational echelons and military strategy, a study that could easily take a lifetime. Thus, many would think it proper to enhance student creativity and critical thinking through a deep study of the classics of military history and of historical campaigns.

&gt; * Given the substantially changed strategic environment, clearly highlighted by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and China’s increasing belligerence, it is professional malpractice for the war colleges and other PME institutions to refuse to return their primary focus to the study of warfare.

* Whether Russia wins (very unlikely), loses (likely), stalemates (most likely) in the Ukraine war, the key lesson - and one that the PRC is most interested in - is whether or not the so-called ""rules-based order"" can be challenged and, if yes, then what the repercussions may/would be. Personally, I don't think the Chinese are in any way deterred. People tend to underestimate Deng's advice to his own countrymen, but it is something that the PRC has been following quite faithfully (and yes, this includes how the PRC has conducted itself post the rise of Xi to the presidency).

* Countries go to war for imperatives that are peculiar to them. By this I mean the imperative to go to war could be a domestic political reason, it could be an economic reason, it could even be a social reason in addition to the real or imagined threat-perceptions of the country in question. The assumption that countries *may* or *could* be deterred by observing that ""aggression does not pay"" is, in my opinion, misleading and a highly dangerous one.

* Commentators like Fukuyama, Synder (among others) are wedded to a neoliberal agenda that seeks a universal application. Proponents of this agenda presume (wrongly in my opinion) that all countries (ultimately and in a fundamental sense) share the core (liberal) values that they espouce. And, if they don't ""share"" those values, then they have to be ""brought to heel"" and made to see the value of such values and compelled to conform.

LOL. Imagine thinking this has any relevance to 2022. It was the Soviet doctrine PRIOR TO WW2: ""Deep operation (Russian: Глубокая операция, glubokaya operatsiya), also known as Soviet Deep Battle, was a military theory developed by the Soviet Union for its armed forces **during the 1920s and 1930s.**""

&gt;Warsaw Pact could put around 5 million men onto the field, Russia can manage 200k. 

Irrelevant since numbers of light infantry are of far lesser importance now in modern warfare, and because Russia STILL outnumbered Ukraine when it attacked anyway.

&gt;One thing this conflict has shown is that artillery is effective against heavily armored tanks, which was not appreciated during the cold war.

You're wrong. Artillery has always been ""effective"", just not efficient, and the same is true even now in the Ukraine war. Artillery without precision guidance will only very rarely hit an enemy tank. Just because you've seen a few clips on twitter showing hits doesn't mean that it's representative. And this has always been known since WW2. Artillery was used against tanks in WW2 all the time. 

&gt;Russian mass fires would have inflicted significant attrition on NATO armored units, let alone the ATGM units that were so key.

Nope and nope. Artillery lags in offensives. The only artillery that the USSR would have up quickly would be SPAs, which would be easily killed by air attacks as well as counter battery fire (by the 80s, Soviets never even had this). ATGM units would be concealed, so idk in what world you think they'd be taking any fires at all. NATO tanks would be held back and used for combined arms counter attacks, not sitting in static positions getting shot at.

&gt;Soviet tanks were, at 40 tons, also capable of using back-roads bridges.

T72 is 50 short tons. M1 Abrams was only 60. Imagine thinking that is some sort of decisive difference in what bridges they could cross. 

&gt;In the 1970s the numbers of SACLOS ATGM platforms were more limited.

The US/NATO had tons of TOWs. Hellfires showed up in the 80s. The M47 Dragon was more than good enough to kill T72s. The Dragon was better than plenty of the systems Ukraine is using against Russia now with great success.

&gt;Only the USA and West Germany had a reasonable number of tubes to have a chance to counter-battery Warsaw Pact artillery.

So? They were all fighting together, and NATO relied heavily on air fires from jets and helicopters to supplement artillery. NATO also had counter battery radar by the 1980s, which the USSR never developed, a game-changer that would have made Soviet artillery completely obsolete.

&gt;Comparing 1970s era air defense systems against 2000-2010s era air forces is extremely disingenuous.

Ukraine is entirely using 70s and 80s systems. S300 was developed in the 70s. Not sure what you're on about. 

&gt;However, our military-industrial complex has also stagnated (but not as much)

False.

&gt;There's no 'technological' reason we should expect SAMs to be ineffective against aircraft, just a lack of investment in SAM technology.

You're clueless. There has been huge investment thanks to the desire for ABM capabilities. 

&gt;The T-64 was qualitatively significantly superior to anything NATO fielded for 20 years.

Nope. The Israelis used M60s to beat T62s in 1973. The M60 was adequate against the T64, and the T64 was more like a medium tank. It didn't have anything special for armor protection. The T64 was introduced in 1966. It never saw combat, so you can't say it was superior to anything. It was quickly withdrawn from Afghanistan in favor of older tanks. M1 was 1980, so that's only 14 years. 

&gt;Deep battle doctrine was scary

No, it wasn't, and it was a defensive doctrine from the 1930s.

&gt;Overall I'd encourage you to stop taking such shallow ideological stances. 

Overall I'd encourage you to hit the books and learn a lot more before you spout off as if you know anything about what you're talking about.",24c461d14e937cdd5e77bc8de9735d71312f96fa,True,False,,,,,0,1654774403,,0,{},ibpxu6v,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t1_ibnkx9r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibpxu6v/,1654774420,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654745603.0

I gotta say this feels a bit fishy. They don't say where this ""intelligence report"" came from or what its sources were. The wording implies a Ukrainian viewpoint, but it could just as easily be from a OSINT researcher or even Russian disinfo.

Regardless, the quoted sections of the report seems to make a some fundamental errors in its evaluations. Trying to compare the ranges of conventional artillery like the M777 and a ballistic missile system like the Iskander is ludicrous, the two aren't remotely in the same category of weapon system, with different usage cases and roles on the battlefield. It's better to compare the M777 to the 2S19 or D30, which it does outrange, and state Ukraine lacks any capacity to respond to ballistic missile strikes. 

It also seems to think Ukraine's air defense is based on MANPADs like the stinger. Russian ground attack aircraft have to fly right on the deck because if they don't they'll be shot down by larger SAM systems, hardly the ""complete domination"" this report describes. In that region they are only vulnerable to MANPADs though, and the Russians do seem to achieved some level of air superiority along sections of the Donbass front.

a) they've backed out of the residential zone of the city to the industrial zone (closer to Ukrainian artillery and fortified from Russian artillery) over a week ago.  After that moment, they've staged several counterattacks into the city, disrupting Russian advances, which seems to suggest they're planning to stay in the industrial zone for the immediate future.

b) these counterattacks included foreign volunteers that were previously on other fronts, along with other fresh well-trained units, which further suggests that Ukrainians aren't just treating this as a throwaway retreat, but are actually committing worthwhile resources to the fight.

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"Leaders may be intimately familiar with their own national histories, but they know and care less about what happened to other nations in similar circumstances.

A second problem—one highlighted in the work of the late scholar Robert Jervis—is that humans tend to place more weight on their own experiences than on the experiences of others. Leaders in one country may be intimately familiar with their own national history (though they have probably absorbed a self-serving version of it), but they will know and care less about what happened to other nations in similar circumstances.

And it’s easy to dismiss another country’s failure by claiming their cause was not as just, their resolve not as great, and their military not as competent as one’s own. Moreover, because decisions for war typically reflect a complex weighing of threats, opportunities, expected costs, and alternatives, what happened to another country in a wholly different conflict may not loom large in their calculations.

Furthermore, leaders who start wars are often aware that there are risks involved, and they sometimes recognize that the odds of victory are slim. Even so, they will “roll the iron dice” if they believe the alternative is even worse. To take an obvious example, Japan’s leaders in 1941 understood that the United States was vastly stronger and that attacking Pearl Harbor was a huge gamble that would probably fail. Nonetheless, they believed the alternative was bowing to U.S. pressure and giving up their quest for great-power status and Asian dominance—an outcome they regarded as infinitely worse.

The bottom line is that U.S. policymakers should not base their actions today on the belief that victory in Ukraine (or Yemen or Ethiopia or Libya) is going to tilt the arc of history decisively in the directions they favor. Nor will the outcome of today’s conflicts have much effect on how future leaders think about their own prospects when they are deciding whether to launch a war.

There are good reasons to support Ukraine’s efforts to resist Russia (though reasonable people can disagree about how far that support should go), but the future of democracy does not hang in the balance. Instead of seeing this war as an opportunity to teach Russia a lesson, policymakers should concentrate on identifying the specific interests and issues at stake right now and try to devise a peace settlement that can give everyone enough of what they want to discourage another round of fighting.

Figuring out how to do that is hard enough, without fooling ourselves into thinking that the fate of humanity rests on the outcome.",3b12b7926a182d4e31d714b61cf4425699b4bce1,True,False,,,,,0,1654745402,,0,{},ibowthf,False,t3_v83zbs,False,True,t1_ibowssv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v83zbs/will_teaching_aggressors_a_lesson_deter_future/ibowthf/,1654745412,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654716602.0
[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"Westerners—such as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg—who favor ever-greater levels of support for Ukraine sometimes imply that inflicting a decisive defeat on Russia will prevent future wars in other places. If Russia is decisively beaten, or at least denied any significant gains, the West will have shown that “aggression does not pay.” Not only will Russian President Vladimir Putin learn his lesson and never try something like this again, but other world leaders who might be contemplating the use of force—such as Chinese President Xi Jinping—will think twice before trying something similar.

Some observers, such as Francis Fukuyama, go even further and suggest a decisive Russian defeat could end the malaise that Western liberalism has experienced in recent years and restore the waning “spirit of 1989.”

If Ukraine and the West fail to inflict a crushing defeat on the Russian aggressor, however, and if Kyiv is eventually forced to compromise with Moscow, then illiberal ideals will be partly vindicated, and the risk of future aggression (including new Russian gambits) will increase. As U.S. President Joe Biden wrote in the New York Times: “If Russia does not pay a heavy price for its actions, it will send a message to other would-be aggressors that they too can seize territory and subjugate other countries.” More alarmingly, historian Timothy Snyder warns that “the fate of democracies hangs in the balance.”

Arguments of this sort have been a staple of hard-line (and especially neoconservative) discourse for decades. Like the domino theory, which refuses to die no matter how often it is disproved, such claims transform the outcome of a single conflict into a struggle for the fate of the entire planet. The choice we are said to face is stark. Down one path: a revitalized liberal order led by a unified alliance of powerful, peace-loving democracies, and a future where war is rare and prosperity reigns. Down the other path: a world of rising autocracy, eroding human rights, and more war. According to this view, Ukraine must win big, or all is lost.

Framing the issue in this way stacks the deck in favor of always doing more and rejecting any sort of compromise, but is the choice as stark as hard-liners make out? Does defeating an aggressor really teach others to behave better? It would be a more benign world if this were the case, but a quick glance at the past century or so suggests otherwise.

Start with World War I. Although all the major European powers played a role in the outbreak of war, Germany was the driving force during the July Crisis of 1914. Overly fearful of rising Russian power, German leaders used the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and the confrontation between Austria-Hungary and Serbia as the occasion for a preventive war for hegemony in Europe. The result was four horrific years of war, a total German defeat at the hands of the Allies, the end of the Hohenzollern monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman allies, and the imposition of a highly punitive peace treaty.

The stark reality of Germany’s World War I defeat didn’t teach Adolf Hitler not to make his own bid for European hegemony 20 years later.

Yet the stark reality of Germany’s defeat didn’t teach Adolf Hitler not to make his own bid for European hegemony some 20 years later; indeed, the myth that Germany had been stabbed in the back and the harsh peace imposed at Versailles helped fuel the rise of Nazism and set the stage for another round of war. Nor did the carnage of the First World War teach Imperial Japan that trying to carve out its own empire in Asia was a bad idea.

The chief aggressors were also soundly punished in World War II. Japan was firebombed repeatedly, and two of its cities were destroyed by atomic bombs; Germany was occupied and subsequently divided into two separate states; and Hitler and Italian leader Benito Mussolini both ended up dead. A clearer demonstration that “aggression does not pay” would be hard to imagine, and a good case can be made that both Germany and Japan learned that lesson well. But this lesson didn’t stop Kim Il Sung from attacking South Korea in 1950 (with Joseph Stalin’s full support) or convince various leaders elsewhere in Asia or the Middle East that going to war was always unwise.

Similarly, one might have thought the French and American experiences in Vietnam would offer a vivid and enduring reminder of the dangers of hubris and the limits of military power, not to mention the futility of trying to nation-build in a deeply divided society without a competent local partner. Yet the George W. Bush administration paid no heed to this lesson when it invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.

Mind you, it’s not just great powers that get taught harsh lessons after launching an aggressive war. Back in 1982, Argentina’s military junta decided that the British Falkland Islands (which they call the Malvinas) were theirs and decided to take the territory by force. Britain sank the flagship of the Argentine navy and successfully retook the islands, and popular protests in Argentina eventually swept the generals from power.

Iraq’s Saddam Hussein eventually suffered a similar fate. His decision to attack revolutionary Iran in 1980 led to nearly eight years of war in which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives and Iraq’s economy cratered. Two years later, he decided to solve the economic problems the first war had created by seizing neighboring Kuwait, only to be ignominiously expelled by a U.S.-led coalition and placed under highly intrusive United Nations sanctions. Aggression didn’t pay in either case, but Saddam’s failures didn’t stop some other countries—including some prominent democracies—from starting new wars themselves.

If painful defeats really sent clear warnings to others, the Soviet and American experiences in Afghanistan and the U.S. experience in Iraq after 2003 would have taught Putin and his associates that invading Ukraine was likely to trigger a powerful nationalist reaction and encourage outside powers to do what they could to thwart his aims. Surely he knew that the United States had helped defeat the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan by supplying the mujahideen, just as Syria and Iran had each helped the Iraqi insurgents defeat the U.S. effort in Iraq. The lesson of these two conflicts seems all too obvious, but Putin seems to have convinced himself it didn’t apply to Ukraine.

Not every aggressive war ends in defeat, of course, but there seems to be no shortage of cases where aggressors were badly beaten and more than a few where the people who started the war paid a large personal price for their folly. Yet the lesson that “aggression does not pay” is typically ignored or forgotten. Why?

One reason is that the lessons of any given war aren’t always clear-cut, and reasonable people can draw different conclusions from a defeat. Was going to war a bad idea from the start, or was defeat due to poor implementation or just bad luck? The lessons from a failed war will also be discarded if policymakers believe that this time is different, and that new knowledge, new technology, a clever new strategy, or a uniquely favorable set of political circumstances will bring success this time around. One should never underestimate what elites can talk themselves into if they really want to go to war.",b5ab83c0ef613ae22e280e6cb88ae1c153e1904e,True,False,,,,,0,1654745393,,0,{},ibowssv,False,t3_v83zbs,False,True,t1_ibouwp9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v83zbs/will_teaching_aggressors_a_lesson_deter_future/ibowssv/,1654745405,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654716593.0
[],False,,faroffIands,,,[],,,,text,t2_kb6geuzd,False,False,"I think this misses a couple of points though:

1) Ukraine was divided politically by relatively Pro-Russian parties who were actively receiving support from the Kremlin. Any move to raise taxes for more military funding risked alienating large portions of the public, who were ready to believe Russian narratives that Ukraine was not pushing for peace.

2) The majority of the time since 2014 western leaders openly signaled to Ukrainians to cool things down, very very few predicted this invasion even if the skirmishing continued, and there were constant suggestions by everyone that a mass invasion would be met with strongly.

3) The economy might have been better than very poor non European countries, but it was pretty damn bad. Before Russia started this massive continuous taxing skirmishing in the Donbass, Ukraine had only barely reached the level of the 1990s pre-Soviet collapse, and this now included a very unequal and corrupt economy which has actually not grown since 2014, it has shrunk. Reforming a society, raising funds, fighting a constant border skirmish with a nation with many multiples more resources and a spigot of cash in oil money, and also building up a military to respond in case of an invasion you don't know if it will occur was obviously extremely difficult. It has already been a drain on Ukraine.

4) You can't just say ""tax the oligarchs"" because they became oligarchs precisely by rigging the politics and laws of the country in their favor. Its really hard to get American's to warm to the idea of raising taxes on the rich, because the rich are able to convince them it really means taxes on them, so it is not hard to see that doing so in Ukraine would have been equally difficult. There would be the same endless screaming that it will hurt the economy (and with some truth, since military spending is a genuine drain on economies, though plenty of oligarch money is not being reinvested but leaving the country).

5) Russia had been making war scares continuously for a long time. Even if they didn't invade, it is difficult to mobilize people repeatedly when there are false alarms. 

I don't think you are wrong, Ukraine could have done more to prepare, but Ukrainian leaders in their position and Ukrainian people now have to do the best they can with the cards they were dealt.

That wasn't my assessment.  I was referring to the inherent limit to how much money they could spend on their army before facing significant political backlash or economic issues, which is higher than 3.2%, but I'm hypothesizing it isn't **much** higher.

&gt;Doubling the defense budget could have been accomplished by raising taxes on their oligarchs

In countries like that, the government's stability at least partially rests on favour from oligarchs, so that move has downsides.

Again, I think a 5% or a 6% military also would not have ""deterred"" Russia from invading, having seen what we have seen.  In fact, Ukraine announcing such a doubling of the budget would have probably just triggered the invasion early, since Ukraine becoming more militarily powerful is suspected to be a primary reason the Kremlin panicked in the first place.

The Russian regulars (VDV, Naval Infantry, etc) took heavy losses during the push out of Popasna.

Reportedly they're scrounging together training officers, older reservists, and hastily trained new recruits into a new set of BTGs to be deployed in ~2-3 weeks. I'd expect a new push around then.

Doubling the defense budget could have been accomplished by raising taxes on their oligarchs, stamping out corruption, or just taxing the population more.

From that perspective I thought that this article made its case rather well. Humans are not very good at learning from the mistakes of others. 

However I also feel that the scope that the author chose to look at here is too narrow, and bypasses the argument that many make when they say to deter future wars by helping Ukraine in its defense. As when the case is made to dissuade China for example from attacking Taiwan, the issue is also about showing that the West has the resolve to rise to the occasion, and the fortitude to endure hardships when enacting their will. 

So in this example the issue is not just China watching Russia's failures and thinking that that outcome could be theirs, but that those in the West that oppose wars of aggression will have the back bone to actually do something about it. This is not taken into consideration in the author's realist perspective and I feel that this is a major factor left out of the article. 

-----------------

&gt; * One reason is that the lessons of any given war aren’t always clear-cut, and reasonable people can draw different conclusions from a defeat. Was going to war a bad idea from the start, or was defeat due to poor implementation or just bad luck? The lessons from a failed war will also be discarded if policymakers believe that this time is different, and that new knowledge, new technology, a clever new strategy, or a uniquely favorable set of political circumstances will bring success this time around. One should never underestimate what elites can talk themselves into if they really want to go to war.

&gt; * The bottom line is that U.S. policymakers should not base their actions today on the belief that victory in Ukraine (or Yemen or Ethiopia or Libya) is going to tilt the arc of history decisively in the directions they favor. Nor will the outcome of today’s conflicts have much effect on how future leaders think about their own prospects when they are deciding whether to launch a war.

&gt; * There are good reasons to support Ukraine’s efforts to resist Russia (though reasonable people can disagree about how far that support should go), but the future of democracy does not hang in the balance. 

&gt; * Instead of seeing this war as an opportunity to teach Russia a lesson, policymakers should concentrate on identifying the specific interests and issues at stake right now and try to devise a peace settlement that can give everyone enough of what they want to discourage another round of fighting.

[],False,,hatesranged,,,[],,,,text,t2_3svjqav4,False,False,"1. is a good point.  SD is their last bridgehead over the SD river, but it's well established that Kherson and the South have more political value to Ukraine, and even with SD intact would be a lot easier to retake than lost areas in the Donbas.  So if their goal right now is to enable counterattacks, the units they're pouring into SD would probably be more valuable in Kherson or Zaporozhia.

2. is a good point and I've been thinking that too.  Ukraine's current stance is very consistent with trying to make SD this war's Stalingrad.  The problem is, it seems pretty nutty.

In the North the Russians overextended and had to retreat. This is not the case in the Donbas region. It will be a hard slog to retake.
