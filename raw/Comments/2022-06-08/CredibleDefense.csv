Key Takeaways  
  
Russian forces continued assaults against Ukrainian positions in Severodonetsk. Russian forces simultaneously seek to outflank Ukrainian positions in the region to avoid the necessity of making an opposed crossing of the Siversky Donets river.  
Russian forces are continuing operations around Sviatohirsk and west of Lyman to link up with operations southeast of Izyum and drive on Slovyansk.  
Russian forces are intensifying their operations in northwestern Kherson Oblast in response to recent Ukrainian counterattacks.  
Russian forces in Zaporizhia Oblast are focusing ground and artillery attacks near the Zaporizhia-Donetsk Oblast border and likely are seeking to strengthen control of the highway between Vasylivka-Orikhiv and Huliapole to support operations in northeast Zaporizhia.  
Russian-backed occupation authorities are attempting to set conditions for the political integration of occupied areas into the Russian Federation but are likely acting independently and in an incoherent manner due to the lack of a unifying occupation authority.  
Russian forces intensified psychological and information operations to degrade Ukrainian morale.",0fdf11d14910b80d2cfeb5e8c27f0cba969d79fd,True,False,,,,,0,1654732704,,0,{},ibo7p3m,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t3_v7nxmn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibo7p3m/,1654732721,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654703904.0,

For this reason, the VKS has a purely supportive role, through and through: it is meant to – and equipped to – establish air superiority only over the frontlines, and then support ground or naval forces. Strikes deep into the enemy-controlled territory are a business of missile forces, and forces equipped with cruise missiles. Search and destroy enemy air defences (SEAD)? Yes, but along the frontline only. Therefore, and even if operating such ‘powerful, super-turbo-Wunderwaffen’ like Su-27SM, Su-30SM, Su-34 and Su-35s, the VKS is simply not equipped to ‘go places’, ‘rule the skies’, ‘dominate’ etc. into the depth of the enemy territory.

Zelensky is now going on record as unambiguously saying ""SD may decide the fate of the Donbas""

I don't like this because:

a) no it freaking won't, at all.  SD is an important political location but it's not the ""last stronghold of the Donbas"" or anything of the sort.  Tactically, SD isn't propping anything else in the Ukrainian position up, it's tactically vulnerable and isolated, and there's a reason Russia only started pushing it after several more ambitious pincers/encirclements failed.  It's the most isolated point in the salient, the salient is propping it up, not vice versa.

b) SD is by far the most tactically vulnerable Ukrainian position right this second.  It's probably the only city one would rate as ""likely to fall"" right now.  And that's the city you're going on record as saying ""we're screwed if this falls"".  Why?  Why the heck would you do that?

It's something I was hoping they'd do when it became apparent war would start (mainly because it's what the Armenians **didn't** do enough in the second NK war), but admittedly their situation is somewhat different from Karabakhs.

Like, civilian trucks and people constantly come in and out of a lot of the border crossings with Belarus and Russia that Russia then advanced out of.  It's a pretty big step to mine them all up when the war hasn't even started yet.

&gt;is more a product of Russian military rot in its structure than anything else. This simply cannot be attributed to Ukrainian military excellence and proper levels of funding.

I mean, it's both.  A lot of the early on terrible choices by Russia weren't just a question of ""rot"", they were a question of them assuming they were invading a bunch of chumps, like Georgia in 2008 or Crimea in 2014.  If the Ukrainians were chumps, Russia would have continued rolling.  In fact, on the one frunt that they were chumps (the southern), they did roll for quite a while.

The early trajectory of the war was decided by a combination of Russian mistakes and Ukrainian abilities.  And I think it's important to note that Ukraine being a militarized state is an important part of the equation.

&gt;No other country in Europe has the security challenges that Ukraine has by a long shot, I do not think that trying to use other European nations as a yard stick is useful or informative at all

Yeah but my point is Ukraine's army was also significantly more militarized than those.  It had like 600-800 towed artillery, 1000 tanks (obviously many mothballed), a corresponding number of armoured vehicles, these aren't rookie numbers, and they eclipse the rest of Europe significantly.  So it's unfair to say Ukraine wasn't trying to meet their security needs.

I do maintain that there's a limit to how much Ukraine could have spended on military without collapsing politically or economically, like I said before, and I don't know that limit but I wouldn't be shocked if it wasn't much higher than 3.2%.",59a8e9721ec4e3df72725ef8092028f1bf4eee40,True,False,,,,,0,1654729311,,0,{},ibo0x06,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t1_ibnzdu7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibo0x06/,1654729325,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654700511.0,

So you're saying the percentage of GDP dedicated to defense is very similar to the US, the nation that's stereotyped as spending insane amounts on defense?

This is not what I would call a ""bare minimum spent on national defense"".  As a fledgling economy I have no clue how high Ukraine could raise their defense spending without suffering political or economic collapse.

Whatever that may be, the reality is that what army Ukraine retained was capable of beating back the (significantly more militarized) Russian army in many theaters, so I think calling it a ""bare minimum army"" is a bit unfair, especially when we can look at other European countries and see what ""bare minimum"" actually looks like.  

I think there's a misconception (not by you but by many people) that Ukraine was just some agrarian hippie community and not a nation sitting on a large amount of equipment, an expansive military, and an indigenous heavy weapons program, many of whose results (stugna, neptune, btr-4) are performing well on the field against an ostensibly more advanced foe.

I don't think there was a realistic amount of defense spending Ukraine could have survived economically that could have provided that.  Non-nuclear deterrence doesn't work if the other guy just says ""nah I'm going to attack despite it being a bad idea"" which is in my opinion what happened.

*Russia’s War in Ukraine and Implications for Its Influence Operations in the West*

https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IS-524.pdf

Dr. Michaela Dodge is a Research Scholar at the National Institute for Public Policy.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and its subsequent atrocities on Ukrainian territory have affected Moscow’s ability to successfully conduct influence operations in the West, but whether this will continue remains to be seen. Russia’s aggression made the execution of its influence operations more difficult, but the Kremlin will try to utilize the Ukrainian migration wave to other countries to stir discontent and plant divisive false narratives within western societies.

*Russia’s War in Ukraine Makes Russia’s Influence Operations in the West More Difficult to Execute*

&gt; * Anecdotally, the Czech Republic saw a temporary decrease in pro-Russian internet trolling activities after it expelled 18 Russian intelligence officers posing as diplomats in April 2021.9 The trolling resumed after about 6 weeks, presumably after the expelled Russians got their new assignments.

&gt; * Despite some setbacks, Russia’s influence operations will continue in the future.17 If anything, Russia may utilize them more than ever given that they are a tool of choice vis-à-vis stronger opponents and Russia’s war in Ukraine is weakening Russia in the short- and long-run. 

&gt; * Russian influence operations appear to be hampered by the consequences of its war in Ukraine, but the United States and its allies should not take this situation for granted.25 Russia’s influence operations online are slowly creeping back to their pre-war levels, which is why the United States and allies must continue to be vigilant in light of Russia’s continued activities.

Obviously, the media affects how the public perceives matters like these. **That's the whole reason Taiwan and Yemen will have different reactions!** An attack by a rival on an ally is obviously going to cause a reaction in the West(and Western institutions) that an attack by an ally on a third party does not. An attack on an area of strategic importance is obviously going to garner a stronger response than an attack on an area with less strategic value.

Your second paragraph is just completely nonsensical. Could there theoretically exist a situation in which helping Taiwan could be counter to Western strategic interest? Maybe in some fantasy world, sure. But in the world we live in right now, helping Taiwan resist Chinese aggression is squarely in the West's interests. That's part of why Taiwan will garner a major reaction where Yemen did not.

“Thus came into being the IRIS-T SL, which is radar-guided: in combination with at least two types of AESA radars, it’s the core of the MEADS air defence system, capable of engaging targets out to about 37km. So far, everything’s fine.


Now, while IRIS-T-missiles are in series production for years already, and thousands have entered service with something like a dozen air forces around the world, the service entry of the surface-to-air variant came forward very slowly. The main German manufacturer, Diehl, was lately assembling exactly two systems a year (each including vertical launchers, radars, and fire-control stations, all of these truck-mounted and thus mobile). Indeed, the company was ‘busy’ producing seven such systems ordered by Egypt and, as soon as the delivery of the IRIS-T SL to Ukraine was announced, seems to have explained that, under ideal circumstances — i.e. provided it could get all the necessary parts together — it might be able to assemble four systems a year.


Means: in best case, Ukraine might get 2,5–3 IRIS-T SLs by the end of this year. Sure, each is capable of defending something like a city the size of, say, Zaporizhzhya, but even this became possible only because Washington not only convinced Egyptians to wait for what they have ordered (and paid about 50% up front), but seems the entire deal became possible only because the USA have paid for the re-delivery of the two systems to be manufactured this year — to Ukraine (if not a few bribes to Cairo, too: the Generals there are renowned for their predilection for such solutions)…


….and when are the MARS-IIs and the seven Panzerhaubitze 2000s going to be delivered (the Dutch are going to add the others, so to make them a dozen) — is still in the stars…
Sorry, but I think I’ll not waste even more time with this story: it’s scorning members of Ukrainian Armed Forces, at least (if not all the intelligent life on Planet Earth, too). Should Scholz go on like this, as next we can expect him to announce his greatest invention ever: hot water…”

But anyone daring to speak about the slow pace of German heavy weapons deliveries and rolling this eyes about scholz new announcement was called “Russian disinformation” “anti German hatred” and accused of “German bashing” on ukrainianconflict.

I swear that sub has a ridiculous contingent of German defence force like posters. Like any post there with Germany in the title before anyone has even said anything the top comments are whining and preemptively  shutting down the conversation by claiming “I’m sick of all this German bashing this is anti German hatred” “doesn’t this criticism of Germany seem like Russian propaganda supposed to divide the west?”

The CCP will likely use this to launch a campaign to de-mine the area, with other possible actions such as sending in additional military forces to protect demining efforts or even using direct force against vessels involved in minelaying.

At first is appears to have content because it's really long, but that is a facade. It's actually a trap inviting people to waste their time refuting vague and amorphous statements.

&gt;I’m not huge into polling, but it has some value, and recent polls suggest that the Biden administration (as well as social media circles like this one) are completely out of touch on this issue.

No polls provided. Prospective repliers can presumably begin their response by scouring the Internet until they find something that supports OP, then argue against themselves.

&gt;America does not want to keep suffering for Ukraine. Economic pain hurts people. If it seems like it’s just a chore then you’re lucky. Most Americans are worried about the economy.

Several self evident truths that don't lead to any actionable analysis. You might as well say ""People don't like bad things."" Are the bad things present? Will taking some course of action prevent it reduce the bad things? Who knows, neither were asserted.

&gt;According to recent tweets by Rasmussen, Biden has had way worse approval numbers than Trump did at this point in his administration, Ukraine isn’t even in the top five issues people care about, and way more voters polled are worried about securing our own border than they are defending Ukraine’s. 

Here we get to a reference to a poll, which makes it seem like we might be talking about something concrete, but it's merely a mirage. Is OP asserting a causal connection between Ukraine and these issues? If so that seems wrong, Biden's approval numbers were bad before the invasion. 

https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/

As you can see, his ratings went from about 42% approval before the invasion to 41% currently. Exciting.

I'm tempted to assume that the reason this paragraph exists is to argue that bad things are happening in the US as a result of the war, the American people don't think the war in a far off country is worth these bad things, and that the American people want to stop the war, which will stop the bad things.

Of these statements, only the first is obviously true. This poll suggests that the part about American support is wrong, and funny enough suggests Biden's support for Ukraine is one of the more popular things about him. I could go on, but how much more time am I supposed to invest responding to an argument I had to infer myself?

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/05/10/americans-concerns-about-war-in-ukraine-wider-conflict-possible-u-s-russia-clash/

&gt;The information war didn’t work. Some people just got high on their own supply. Ukraine can’t win this and the west isn’t going to fight it for them or even continue hurting the global economy just to drag this out. It doesn’t matter what little battles you talk about or how many people you try to silence. Ukraine has lost this war, they just aren’t willing to admit it, and neither are many of you here. We damaged our economy and let a lot of people die for nothing because we weren’t willing to deal with the other side.

More broad, vague and generally unactionable statements.

[],False,,flamedeluge3781,,,[],,,,text,t2_61s6s6hf,False,False,"I think you're ignoring a fairly massive number of issues:

1. We've seen nothing resembling Soviet Deep-battle doctrine. Not sure why you would make such a claim. You are ""linear regression guy"", however, so simplistic seems to be your modus operandi.
1. The Soviets had a reasonable number of infantry.  Russia does not. The Soviet Union + Warsaw Pact also had an enormous manpower compared to today's Russia, and it shows in the number of formations. Warsaw Pact could put around 5 million men onto the field, Russia can manage 200k. That's a 25x difference.
2. Back in the 1970s precision munitions were not a thing. Mass fires impose a serious logistical cost, but they do work by simple statistics. One thing this conflict has shown is that artillery is effective against heavily armored tanks, which was _not_ appreciated during the cold war. Russian mass fires would have inflicted significant attrition on NATO armored units, let alone the ATGM units that were so key.
3. Soviet tanks were, at 40 tons, also capable of using back-roads bridges. NATO tanks (other than the Leopard 1) were not. Soviets also had huge air mobile formations to support river crossings. They tried to use their airborne troops in this war but the FSB has their fingerprints all over the initial conduct of the war and it shows in the results.
4. In the 1970s the numbers of SACLOS ATGM platforms were more limited. HOT and TOW were good, lethal platforms. Milan was ok but a bit lacking against ERA protected vehicles for much of the period. Dragon was a POS, as were all of the British MACLOS missiles.
5. Only the USA and West Germany had a reasonable number of tubes to have a chance to counter-battery Warsaw Pact artillery. The Belgians, Dutch, and BEF were all woefully under-equipped in artillery relative to the mass that faced them.
5. Comparing 1970s era air defense systems against 2000-2010s era air forces is extremely disingenuous. Somehow you have managed to completely forget the lessons of the Yom Kippur war. We all understand here that the Soviet economy collapsed in the 1980s, and as a result their military-industrial complex has barely advanced in the interim. However, our military-industrial complex has also stagnated (but not as much), due to the US anti-insurgency wars and the general disinterest of Western democracies in war-fighting capacity. There's no 'technological' reason we should expect SAMs to be ineffective against aircraft, just a lack of investment in SAM technology.


In terms of things you have ignored:

1. The T-64 was qualitatively significantly superior to anything NATO fielded for 20 years. Only TOW, HOT, and Maverick (and _maybe_ Chieftan) could reliably kill it.
2. Deep battle doctrine was scary and the USA took awhile to react to it with Air-Land Doctrine. Air-Land battle was and remains a derivative from Deep Battle. I.e. Americans liked it so much they made Soviet doctrine their own, just with more aircraft and PGMs.
3. The NATO tools to defeat the Soviet Union didn't, by in large, arrive until the SU economy collapsed in the Gorbachev-era. Before that the USA had enormous morale and drug-abuse issues following Vietnam. The British, Dutch, and Belgian forces were never very impressive compared to the Warsaw pact forces opposing them and would have been swiftly overrun.

Overall I'd encourage you to stop taking such shallow ideological stances. During the Cold War, NATO was reliant on nuclear weapons for defense, and we are rich enough that we should avoid that stance going forward.",30b0c721910fd6eae2764ed1d569feabca59aea5,True,False,,,,,0,1654721840,,0,{},ibnkx9r,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t1_ibn2h0n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibnkx9r/,1654721855,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654693040.0,

Your argument is also quite funny given that the leninist pro-subsidiarity system actively encouraged the fomenting of ukrainian nationalism..... the exact opposite of what you are claiming.

Yes, it is. If they are of a particular mindset then there exists the possibility that they will engage in an action that suits that mindset.

&gt;But the larger question is... why do you think analysis needs to be ""positive""? ""Normative analysis"" is a thing in economics. In fact... most analysis here is normative; and it is everywhere including all major think tanks.

I want to correct my previous reply: arguments can clearly be logos, pathos, or ethos because those are descriptors of intent. What you are calling ""analysis"" (i.e. a piece from Carnegie Endowment) is really a combination of analysis and argument. There is analysis of observations, historical data, actor motivations, etc. Then there are arguments of various kinds made. If Russia has revanchist mindset then it will try to seize all of Ukraine. If you consider Russia taking over Ukraine to be bad, then NATO should give weapons to Ukraine. The first is a logical appeal and the second is an ethical appeal.

To get to the overall point: no amount of ethical denouncement or emotional response will change a valid and sound logical argument.

&gt;Maybe we're confusing facts with analysis?

&gt; In some fighting zones in the Donbas, Russian commanders have sent in fresh troops every day to replace those on the front. “One soldier advances two metres, and then another comes to push farther,” Tarnavsky said. In areas where battles have been the most intense, Russia has had, by his count, a five-to-one manpower advantage. Tarnavsky also estimated that Russia has an advantage of up to seven-to-one in artillery batteries and a similarly large stockpile of munitions. As a result, Russian forces can rely on wave after wave of indiscriminate fire from large-calibre artillery, along with missile and air strikes, to soften Ukraine’s defenses, inflicting large casualties before they advance.

&gt; I heard multiple stories of Russia’s disproportionate reliance on heavy weaponry. A ten-member Ukrainian reconnaissance unit was spotted during a mission and then fired upon by three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, a munition hefty enough to take out a bridge or an entire command post. Tarnavsky told me of individual Ukrainian artillery systems targeted by Iskander missiles, which cost an estimated five million dollars a shot. “That’s a very expensive pleasure,” he said. “You have to be very rich, or very desperate.”",5bd8dd89a19fd53e26587f6ee43e2fbff81868a1,True,False,,,,,0,1654716637,,0,{},ibn8sxb,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t3_v7nxmn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibn8sxb/,1654716653,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654687837.0,

This creates the present scenario, where the Russian army is no longer able to successfully attack large parts of Ukraine, but can successfully attack small parts of Ukraine, like a particular city everyone is looking at.

However, Russia is still taking significant casualties. If the war continues on its current trajectory, Ukraine morale remained acceptable, and western engagement and supplies remain acceptable, the Russian army will continue taking significant damage.

This means that soon, the Russian army will not be able to successfully attack anything, as it's forces are further degraded. At this point, Ukraine can begin thinking about counterattacks.

Soviet Army, and Russian Army were built around this concept of conventional warfare:

* ridiculous amount of artillery, rocket artillery, and air fire to destroy any enemy resistance just near the frontline
* ridiculous number of tanks and armored vehicles rushes into shelled area to take ground before enemy recovers
* and all Soviet tanks were designed to be able to cross small rivers underwater
* somehow AA will magically work against Western air advantage
* [continue until reaching Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_to_the_River_Rhine)

Well, the whole armored rush idea turned out to be totally impossible with saturation of modern ATGMs, and Ukraine still having functional artillery. Russia lost like 20%-40% of tanks and armored vehicles in active service [depending on how you count things](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-51/), and its supposedly deep reserves are already reaching for T-62s, so that part is just not happening.

Russian ability to cross rivers turned out to be vastly overstated. Even a small river can block them for months.

Israel keeps showing every few years just how weak Soviet AA is against modern air force, fortunately for Russians Ukraine doesn't have a modern air force, and Biden is unwilling to send a few hundred F15s/F16s anytime soon. Either way, that's a non factor until Biden gets his shit together.

So that leaves indiscriminate artillery shelling, plus some more shelling from the air, without any good followup. That's the main area where Russia has an advantage, for now. That's not nothing, but only enough for a very slow crawl.

I have some other objections to your theory here, but you make this speculation at lot and it's generally not true. Russia has struck railway targets repeatedly. They simply haven't managed to do that much damage. At what point in time will we put this myth to bed? Below are a sampling of quotes (there are many more reports) from a wide variety of news outlets (CNN, CNBC, [Trains.com](https://Trains.com), Reuters and others) highlighting attacks on Ukrainian railway infrastructure, which have consistently been carried out from the end of April onwards. Just because Russia is not firing all of its limited stockpiles of cruise missiles at Ukrainian railroads day in and day out doesn't mean they're not targeting railways.  


""In advance of the main Russian attack in the Donbas, which began in mid-April, the region’s rail network was subject to missile and artillery attacks. The network in the Donbas is electrified at 3kV D.C., unlike most of the rest of the UZ system, which uses 25kV A.C., although many secondary lines are not electrified at all.""  


""Elsewhere, while Russian forces withdrew from the area around Kyiv by late March, long-range missile attacks continued, and began to target the rail network. Russian ballistic missiles hit the western city of Lviv on April 18. One location hit was adjacent to several major railway lines although it is unclear, if they or the tire workshop actually hit were the real target.""  


""Additional attacks on April 25 hit railway stations or facilities, including electric traction substations, at five locations in the center or west of the country, according to Ukrainian authorities.""  


""On April 26, a Russian long range missile, reportedly fired from an aircraft operating over the Donbas region, hit the Pidyomnyy Mist bridge west of Odesa. This bridge carries the single track Odesa-Bilhorod/Izmail electrified railway, a road, and power cables.""

The strike on April 28, which injured two people, hit an electrical substation that feeds power to a confluence of railway lines that forms a key hub of networks linking central Europe, Russia, and Asia.

May 10th - The Lviv power station was among six railway facilities in central and western Ukraine targeted by Russian forces on Tuesday evening, according to the chairman of Ukrainian Railways Olexander Kamyshin.  


May 10th - Five train stations in western and central Ukraine were hit in the space of an hour on April 25. Two days later, a missile struck a rail and road bridge across the Dniester Estuary that links the southern port city of Odesa with the country's far southwest region. Then on Friday, another important railway bridge was blown up near the town of Sloviansk in the eastern Donetsk region.

June 6th -  In Kyiv, missile strikes hit a train-repair facility and other infrastructure.

June 2nd - On Wednesday, June 1, between 10.45 om and 10.55 pm, the railway infrastructure in Stryj and Sambir districts was hit by missiles.

On the other hand I really abhorr propaganda and find it brings nothing positive to these discussion, whether it comes from a side or another.

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"This article is very informative on naval mine warfare in general, and not just an examination of it being a tool in a cross strait crisis. This is a very potent and under appreciated aspect of warfare that should be studied as it has the potential to shape the outcome of major wars, and as the author points out, gives leaders a method of escalation below all out war. 

-----------------

&gt; * This article explores the feasibility of a limited minelaying action against China to provide a crisis-response option more forceful than diplomacy but less risky than kinetic operations.1 Using existing assets, it is feasible to lay minefields in the Taiwan Strait, which would both disrupt intra-Chinese trade and delay any Chinese military movement against Taiwan. Such a plan must be developed in peacetime to be available as an option to U.S. leaders in a crisis. Although offensive minelaying often is overlooked, the United States has a history of successful minelaying operations. 

&gt; * During World War I, Great Britain and the United States, despite possessing the strongest fleets in the world, laid seventy thousand mines to hinder German submarines.2 

&gt; * During World War II, the United States, after achieving naval dominance over Japan, launched an offensive minelaying campaign that sank or damaged two million tons of shipping in the last five months of the war. 

&gt; * Most germane to this article, the 1972–73 U.S. mining of Haiphong and other harbors over the course of a few days during the Vietnam War shut down those harbors for almost a year. 

&gt; * In the event of a China-Taiwan conflict, minelaying could be portrayed as “separating the combatants,” like a UN peacekeeping force arrayed between two rival armies. Thus, other states might be more willing to accept such an action as an aid to diplomacy. The pause in Chinese operations that a minefield likely would cause might provide enough time to defuse a crisis. The economic pain caused by reduced or inconvenienced shipping also might influence Chinese decision-making positively. 

&gt; * Minelaying’s greatest advantage is that it does not cause immediate harm but threatens harm if the other side does not yield. It transfers the burden of decision and action onto the other side; as Thomas C. Schelling points out, offering the other side the “last clear chance” to avoid disaster can be a great advantage. 

&gt; * To avoid this painful choice, the Chinese would try to clear any minefield. The key question, then, is how quickly could China remove a minefield and return the situation to the status quo ante? 

&gt; * Analysis of the American bomber arsenal shows that it could lay between 840 and 3,880 mines at one time. Historical cases show that each of China’s twenty available minesweep- ers could clear an average of between 0.8 and 2 mines per day. Therefore, even the smallest minefield would take between twenty-one and fifty-three days to clear. 

&gt; * …the United States could reseed the minefield faster than the Chinese could clear it. 

&gt; * This article proceeds in five parts, examining the following subjects: past of- fensive minelaying operations, the minelaying mission within the hydrography of the Taiwan Strait, U.S. capabilities to plant a minefield, Chinese minesweeping capabilities, and U.S. responses to Chinese minesweeping efforts. 

&gt; * At Wonsan, the United States tried to make an amphibious landing on the North Korean east coast, intending to cut off retreating North Korean forces, as in the Inchon landings several months earlier. However, North Korean mines frustrated the attempt, and coalition forces moving by land arrived at the port first. As the senior naval officer put it, “We have lost control of the seas to a nation without a Navy, using pre–World War I weapons, laid by vessels that were utilized at the time of the birth of Christ.”9 

&gt; * Naval officers also might hesitate to use minelaying because of legal complica- tions. According to The Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, naval mining during armed conflict requires international notification and the recording of mine location for future removal, and mines cannot be placed solely to intercept commercial shipping.14 Any prospective naval mining by the United States could be subjected to complex legal debates. Of course, “in times of war, the law falls silent” 

&gt; * One calculation estimated that the mining of Japanese home waters was nine times more cost-effective than the submarine campaign.19 

&gt; * Offensive mine warfare today may be even more effective than history indicates.

&gt; * Since the world’s oceans are full of trash, this can be time-consuming. 

&gt; * t has been seventy years since great powers engaged in mine- countermine competition. Both sides have made technological advances whose effectiveness cannot be known fully until they are deployed in a wartime environment. 

&gt; * A minelaying campaign, on the other hand, would constitute a forceful response without causing any immediate casualties. 

&gt; * Sixty percent of Chinese trade travels by sea, and maritime imports into China account for a quarter of global maritime trade; a campaign aimed at ports would disrupt this trade severely. 

&gt; * Much of the risk to the bombers would be eliminated by using extended- range variants of the Quickstrikes that currently are in development. 

&gt; * An additional variable is whether any minesweepers themselves are lost to or damaged by the mines. At Wonsan, the United States lost two out of eighteen minesweepers over the course of fifteen days while clearing 225 mines. 

&gt; * Therefore, this article relies on a simulation of the results of a Chinese mine- sweeping operation in which the minesweepers suffer attrition. 

&gt; * Reseeding the minefield with one B-2 bomber every five days likely would be enough to prevent the Chinese from clearing a route for military use. 

&gt; * For strategists, this article shows how the exploration of unorthodox lines of action can expand the Navy’s tool kit. Mines represent a historically effective weapon about which the United States thinks too little. 

&gt; * Developing plans and capabilities now not only would make the Navy more potentially useful; it also would set up China for a measure of surprise, likely creating an advantage for the United States and the Navy during a time of great danger. 

&gt; * …for decision makers, having a minelaying option would provide a valu- able additional rung on the escalation ladder between diplomatic initiatives and kinetic strikes.

&gt; Therefore, we can safely assume that even the Russian best-case scenario, which seems to had been a regime change in Kyiv, involved splitting the country into “Russian Eastern Ukraine” and “Ukrainian Western Ukraine”.

IMO the division of Germany and the eventual fall of the Berlin wall proves that this is not a realistic goal. The USSR was much more powerful when compared with today's Russia, yet it still couldn't hold on to their vassals (be it in Germany or the Warsaw pact). Russian leadership has to be kind of delusional to think that they can actually successfully hold onto a new iron curtain.

I think you're being too generous in your assessment of the massive Russian fuck-up by re-framing their war goal as a ""we just want to divide Ukraine"".

&gt; Therefore, Russia is focusing on the one resource the West cannot make good – the population.

Ukraine had a pre-war population of ~40 million. Looking at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Ukraine#Population_by_oblast) if we exclude the entire population of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that still leaves ""West Ukraine"" with 30 million people. Let's assume another 5 million flee and never return, it's still 25 million of angry Ukrainians that Russia has to deal with.

&gt;  the creation of the DPR/LPR statelets has proven to be a successful experiment.

A success for whom? If it were a success Russia wouldn't have to invade Ukraine as people would just chose to become part of Russia.
Calling the DPR/LPR experiment a success is an excellent attempt in spinning reality to just fit whatever you like.
Russia still hasn't fully recovered from the 2014 sanctions. DPR/LPR is an economic black hole and is going to keep being a drag on Russian economy.

&gt; If this kind of indoctrination can be achieved in Donetsk and Luhansk – why not in Mariupol or Sloviansk, cities further west where the pro-Russian sentiment was also strong in 2014?

**Every Million Counts – War for Ukraine’s Population**

  
*Both Russia’s initial intervention goal and the most likely outcome of the Ukrainian war are a divided Ukraine. The degree of real victory/defeat for Russia (as opposed to the inevitable end-war propaganda for domestic consumption) will be measured by the level of “neutralisation” (i.e. powerlessness) of the future rump Ukraine. The key resource Russia is fighting for, however, is not territory, but population.*  
  
  
The war started with Ukraine divided into the government-controlled Ukraine and the separatist “DPR and LPR” provinces in the east. It is almost certain to end the same way, with a divided Ukraine. The chances of either side achieving a total victory, Russia occupying the entire Ukraine, or Kyiv restoring control over all of its territory are about equal – almost zero.  
  
The goal of Russia, as the aggressor trying to impose its will, never seemed to have been to control the entire Ukraine. Even the Russian most optimistic and radical nationalistic circles always envisaged leaving some kind of independent Western Ukraine (variously described as “Catholic Ukraine”, “Bandera Ukraine”, or “Nazi Ukraine”) as a reservation for the incorrigibly anti-Russian population. Therefore, we can safely assume that even the Russian best-case scenario, which seems to had been a regime change in Kyiv, involved splitting the country into “Russian Eastern Ukraine” and “Ukrainian Western Ukraine”.  
  
The Ukrainian government also seems to have no real ambition or hope of reconquering the rebel areas of Donbas (or Crimea). In other words, Kyiv also expects the war to end in “Russian Ukraine” and “Ukrainian Ukraine”.  
  
With a new dividing line between Russia and the West (Ukraine) being at this point an almost certain outcome of the war, the level of victory/defeat will be defined by the location of that line. The minimum geographic Russian war aims have already been stated – the entire Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, which they might finish conquering in foreseeable future. Russia additionally controls the entire Kherson province and about half of the Zaporizhzhia. As far as the land-grab aspect is concerned, Moscow can already sell the war to its population as a victory.  
  
However, in this war, taking land per se is secondary and is only a tool for achieving the main goal. Moscow went to war for several reasons, but only one truly driving imperative – neutralise Ukraine as a source of (real or perceived) threat in the long term. Since any future Ukraine is certain to be thoroughly anti-Russian and pro-NATO, this remanent must be made as powerless as possible.  
  
This is where the “neutralisation” and “demilitarisation” of Ukraine come into play. The first is usually defined by Russian sources as Ukraine giving up its NATO ambitions. The demilitarisation would mean making Ukraine incapable of launching a serious offensive against the Russian separatist areas or Crimea in the foreseeable future. It is likely that this demand will include Ukraine giving up or severely limiting the amount of heavy weaponry, primarily ballistic and long-range missiles, but also tanks, heavy artillery, and UCAVs.  
  
However, Russia is aware that both the neutralisation and the demilitarisation are just stop-gap measures. As has already happened over the last eight years, the West and Ukraine will find a way to circumvent various restrictions and continue arming and modernising the Ukrainian armed forces. Formal peace treaty guarantees can only postpone this process, not prevent it.  
  
That is why the critical war aim is to cripple the Ukrainian war-making capacity in the long term. Considering the almost certain future Western support, even the ongoing strategic Russian campaign of destroying the Ukrainian military production facilities is unlikely to have permanent consequences. Therefore, Russia is focusing on the one resource the West cannot make good – the population. With every kilometre that the line of divide is moved to the west, Russia is depriving Ukraine of military and production manpower – currently the Russian-controlled areas include about 4 million in Donetsk and Luhansk, 1 million in Kherson, 1 million in Zaporizhzhia, 2 million in Crimea. The continued Russian army advance has two objectives – to “liberate” as many really or potentially pro-Russian Ukrainians as possible, and drive out as many “incorrigible” Ukrainians out of the “liberated” area. Preferably out of Ukraine altogether. The peculiar Russian failure to target railway communication makes sense in that case - if the goal is to facilitate the exodus of refugees from Ukraine, further reducing its population potential.  
  
Furthermore, the creation of the DPR/LPR statelets has proven to be a successful experiment. After eight years of Russian propaganda, these three million former Ukrainian citizens are today providing the solid core of the invading army. Overshadowed by Russian regular army’s underperformance, it has escaped public notice that the DPR/LPR units (60,000+) are performing above expectations. Particularly the DPR/LPR regular units seem to be the driving force behind most of the Russian successes, inflicting and incurring most casualties while consistently displaying high motivation and morale. If this kind of indoctrination can be achieved in Donetsk and Luhansk – why not in Mariupol or Sloviansk, cities further west where the pro-Russian sentiment was also strong in 2014? From Moscow’s point of view, several years of Russian propaganda might make these newly conquered areas as anti-Ukrainian as Donetsk and Lugansk are today.  
  
By pushing the East-West dividing line further west, Russia not only deprives Ukraine of manpower but increases the potential manpower reserves of its future Ukrainian puppet state. Obviously, such advance is subject to the law of diminishing returns – the further west Russia advances the less pro-Russian the population becomes, making both the conquest and the post-war occupation more costly. Still, if Russia manages to secure a sizeable territory for its puppet state in Eastern Ukraine (perhaps doubling or tripling the area previously controlled by the separatists), it will be laying a solid foundation for the creation of a permanent threat to Kyiv. And this state, with the current separatist areas at its core, would ideologically be just as vehemently anti-Ukrainian as the surviving Kyiv-led Western Ukraine is bound to be anti-Russian.  
  
Such a result would weaken Ukraine in the long term far more than any strategic air bombing or neutrality guarantees ever would.",93ca8d980b3ecbc3707d9e81338c7bb9e9c78706,True,False,,,,,0,1654701154,,0,{},ibm851c,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t3_v7nxmn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibm851c/,1654701168,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654672354.0,

&gt; 
&gt; Governments often withhold information from the public for operational security. But these information gaps within the U.S. government could make it more difficult for the Biden administration to decide how to target military aid as it sends billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. officials said the Ukrainian government gave them few classified briefings or details about their operational plans, and Ukrainian officials acknowledged that they did not tell the Americans everything.    
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; The United States provides regular, near real-time intelligence updates to Ukraine about the location of Russian forces, information that the Ukrainians use to plan operations and strikes and strengthen their defenses.
&gt; 
&gt; But even in high level conversations with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or Lloyd J. Austin III, the secretary of defense, Ukrainian officials share only their strategic goals, not their detailed operational plans. Ukraine’s secrecy has forced U.S. military and intelligence officials to try and learn what they can from other countries operating in Ukraine, training sessions with Ukrainians and Mr. Zelensky’s public comments, American officials said.  
&gt; 
&gt; ...  
&gt; 
&gt; But there may be a potential cost if the intelligence community cannot present a fuller picture to the public or Congress about Ukraine’s military prospects, Ms. Sanner said. If Russia advances further, the failure to understand the state of the Ukrainian military could open the intelligence community to accusations that it failed to deliver a full picture of Ukraine’s prospects in the war to policymakers.
&gt; 
&gt; “Everything is about Russia’s goals and Russia’s prospects for meeting their goals,” Ms. Sanner said. “We do not talk about whether Ukraine might be able to defeat them. And to me, I feel that we are setting ourselves up for another intel failure by not talking about that publicly.”

**Key Takeaways**

&gt;Russian forces have likely established control over the majority of the residential sector of Severodonetsk and conducted assaults against Ukrainian positions in the industrial zone in the past 24 hours. The operational environment within the city remains fluid.

&gt;Russian forces continued efforts to advance on Slovyansk southeast from the Izyum area and west from Lyman, attempting to break through Ukrainian defenses that have halted most direct frontal assaults from Izyum.

&gt;Russian forces are likely attempting to reinforce their operations in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area from both the Toshkivka-Ustynivka area in the south and Kupyansk from the northwest.

&gt;Russian forces began withdrawing troops from positions in Zaporizhia Oblast, likely either to rotate damaged units into rear areas or to reinforce Russian defenses in northwestern Kherson Oblast, though ISW cannot currently confirm the destination of these forces.

&gt;Russian forces failed to regain advanced positions on the western (now Ukrainian-occupied) bank of the Ihulets River on June 7.

&gt;Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that Russian forces restored transit connections between newly occupied cities and Crimea.

&gt;Russian occupation authorities continue to face challenges suppressing Ukrainian resistance and finding partisan supporters despite increasingly draconian occupation measures and attempts to bribe Ukrainian civilians.",2275754fc177198898c7be8def184d4572f5f790,True,False,,,,,0,1654693751,,0,{},ibls3ue,False,t3_v7nxmn,False,True,t3_v7nxmn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v7nxmn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_08_2022/ibls3ue/,1654693766,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654664951.0,

Sure, compared to other modern wealthy liberal democratic states that sounds pretty bad, but we're comparing the UK to Russia here. 

The British procurement pipeline might be dysfunctional and under-funded, but is it significantly more so than Russia's? I doubt it but it's feasible so lets say for the sake of argument it is. Russia is dealing with:

* Sanctions and severe economic contraction

* Pervasive corruption in the military

It will be fascinating to see what the political leadership decides to build/rebuild it for, and how the military leadership will be able to accomplish those goals. 

-------------

&gt; * British weaponry provided to the Ukrainian Armed Forces has made a material difference on the battlefield.

&gt; * But as the UK begins to deliver vitally needed long-range artillery, it is important that other government departments appreciate the need to replenish the UK’s own stocks.

&gt; * The loss of armoured infantry represented a fundamental departure from decades of NATO warfighting doctrine.

&gt; * This timetable has now gone awry.

&gt; * The justification for providing M270 MLRS to Ukraine is sound. Ukraine is attriting the Russian Army and fighting for its survival.

&gt; * It would be foolish, however, for the UK to assume that Russia’s difficulties in Ukraine mean it poses no threat to NATO in the medium term. Russia may be defeated in Ukraine. But NATO must ensure that its own deterrence posture is robust by 2027, at which point Russia could realistically have reconstituted many of its units. 

&gt; * As the UK empties its stockpiles, however, and as those systems it is not giving to Ukraine see their availability plummet, it is clear that restocking will likely see an immediate need for an injection of funds in the Autumn Statement. Given the lead times required for industry to deliver anything into service, if the UK is to offer NATO any significant capabilities by 2027, orders will need to be made within the next year.

&gt; * For the British Army, this presents a challenge. Rather than a kneejerk like-for-like replacement of old systems, the intention following the Integrated Review was to place bets on future capabilities. 

&gt; * The UK government has gained significant credibility among its allies during the war in Ukraine through its willingness to move quickly and decisively in support of its friends. If that credibility is to be translated into influence, however, it is vital that the UK government can show its allies that the British Army will turn up with more than bayonets if Russian aggression should spread beyond Ukraine.

&gt; When Operation Barbarossa was launched the Soviet Union had a very large advantage, quantity wise, in regards to the ratio tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc on the Western Front in comparison to the Germans.

The Soviet Union did have more tanks, artillery, and aircraft on the Western Front in comparison to Germany before the start of Barbarossa, including a massive advantage in tanks. Quantity wise, anyways. Mikhail Meltyukhov covers the numbers extensively in his *Stalin's Missed Chance* series of papers, which are generally considered accurate.   However the most common Soviet tank was the T-26, over 10,000 of them before Barbarossa started, which was already quite obsolete and in poor condition. They also had thousands of BT series of tanks, like the T-26s thousands of them would be destroyed, abandoned, or captured in the opening months of Barbarossa. The same goes with Soviet artillery and aircraft.

The author (and he sounds genuine) is commenting on the artillery aspect of the war. He is criticising the complacency and rigidity of the Russian regular army. Says they considered the Donbas separatist to be backward hicks they had nothing to learn from. The Russian army essentially told them ""stand aside now, real soldiers are here to deal with Ukraine"". It turned out that the separatists with their old 122mm howitzers rejected by the Russian army (and with their eight years of combat experience) were actually much better artillerymen. This led to the separatist units receiving a disproportionate amount of artillery missions, causing an enormous expenditure of 122mm ammo, which was being eliminated by the Russian army anyway. Now the Russian Western Military District had no more 122mm stocks so it had to be brought over from other districts. At the same time, the separatist artillery units are being converted to 152mm guns (still old D-20 models), which temporarily removed some of the best artillery out of the equation.

The Ukrainian artillery was very good, having also survived eight years of counterbattery fire. To eliminate them Russia needed to integrate counterbattery radars, surveillance radars, radio-location, but most of all UAV work. The old Orlan-10 drones proved particularly good for this, since, unlike modern battery-powered drones, the Orlans could cruise and observe for 16 hours.

However, the complex network is not always working, as not all its elements are always operational or exchange data in real time. Also, the Russian regular army was obsessed with the volume of fire, so was using Grads and similar (relatively) light artillery against fortification. They caused a lot of craters but only inconvenienced the defenders. Then the infantry had to pay in blood for those mistakes.

The author concludes that rectifying these problems is expensive and complex, but losing war is even more expensive and complex, so the Kremlin elites should decide what they prefer.",45018ab32f7f2079e8d70c493a456ed5b805bc09,True,False,,,,,0,1654650662,,0,{},ibk0qug,False,t3_v6tksr,False,True,t1_ibjyn0a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6tksr/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_07_2022/ibk0qug/,1654650677,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654621862.0,

The goal is to determine places where your enemy is weakest and where you can attain superiority *and* achieve objectives (the Germans in WW1 were great in the case of the former, but *terrible* at translating that into the achievement of strategic objectives).",cfc9338d4b9fef1497ecf88f34669cf5da7eee8b,True,False,,,,,0,1654648148,,0,{},ibjvtra,False,t3_v6tksr,False,True,t1_ibj8npu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v6tksr/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_07_2022/ibjvtra/,1654648160,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654619348.0,

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"&gt;So, to your first point: russia is incompetent and inefficient.

We agree on this point, but that is not something intrinsically or uniquely Russian (as your earlier statement of ""this is all russia knows"" implied and a cursory glance at history refutes). Incompetent and inefficient societies regularly achieve victory and when they are defeated, it is debatably *not* a causal factor. 

&gt;I'll post this link instead, and bid you farewell.

The key to the McNamara fallacy, *as it is often taught*, is the over-reliance on what is measurable and the notion that **if it can't be measured it is more often than not unimportant.** This is not a *terrible* heuristic for business, but for complex geopolitical and social affairs we *know* that intangibles have an impact on the final outcome. But where does that leave us as analysts? Am I willing to bet that because Germany is a corrupt and inefficient society with extreme degrees of factionalism that they will crumble in the face of mighty French *elan?* Or do I say that ultimately yes this was the determining factor of the war and it was the Soviets who actually held the *workers will to win the fight!* 

Had you actually read my post you would have seen my statement about how we must judge each conflict based on the particular contexts it occurs (social, political, economic, etc.). and not based on our own subjective views of how a society may or may not function at any given time.
