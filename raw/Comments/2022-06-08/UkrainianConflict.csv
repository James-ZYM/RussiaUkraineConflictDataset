Russian forces continued assaults against Ukrainian positions in Severodonetsk. Russian forces simultaneously seek to outflank Ukrainian positions in the region to avoid the necessity of making an opposed crossing of the Siversky Donets river.

Russian forces are continuing operations around Sviatohirsk and west of Lyman to link up with operations southeast of Izyum and drive on Slovyansk.

Russian forces are intensifying their operations in northwestern Kherson Oblast in response to recent Ukrainian counterattacks.

Russian forces in Zaporizhia Oblast are focusing ground and artillery attacks near the Zaporizhia-Donetsk Oblast border and likely are seeking to strengthen control of the highway between Vasylivka-Orikhiv and Huliapole to support operations in northeast Zaporizhia.

Russian-backed occupation authorities are attempting to set conditions for the political integration of occupied areas into the Russian Federation but are likely acting independently and in an incoherent manner due to the lack of a unifying occupation authority.

This imbalance in sentiment was cynically promoted by the Kremlin since it was keen to portray communists as virtuous but vigilant anti-Nazis all along while West Germany as the only successor state to Nazi Germany had to bear the guilt for Nazi atrocities by default.

""Wandel durch Handel"" was also informed by the post-WW II experience and the slow evolution of the EEC to the EU. (West) German leadership figured that if strengthened economic integration could turn the Germans and French from bitter enemies to (fairly) good friends, then why not try the same with the Soviets/Russians who were also bitter enemies of the Germans/Prussians in the 20th century? This only reinforced the seeming validity of classic microeconomic theory in which the focus on utility maximization was measured in economic terms. It helped that the French had also shed a good deal of their imperialistic nostalgia by the middle of the Cold War. For them, the economic benefits of the EEC and later EU weren't treated as a way to recuperate and rebuild its resources to try exacting more revenge for the Franco-Prussian or world wars.

I do think that some German politicians are compromised by Russia. At the same time, the problem is that enough Germans view Americans negatively, and so find common ground already with many Russians from the highest apparatchik to the lowest gopnik. When you combine the tight association between Americans and capitalism, then leftist types like Schröder and Scholz in the SPD don't actually need much compromising to side with the Russians on some issues. In other words, they're the perfect useful idiots for the Kremlin by not being loony Leninists on the fringe but rather part of the establishment who can conveniently make credible and serious criticisms of the greedy and war-mongering Yanks which is all very satisfying to the Russians.

Incidentally, Merkel is a slightly different case by being a true Russophile - apparently she also had a picture of Catherine the Great in her office. (For those who don't know, Catherine was actually a German noble ended up in Imperial Russia as a teenager to eventually marry a future Czar, Peter III). Having stars in her eyes about Russia made her give the benefit of the doubt far too often when up against Putin. He had no shame in exploiting her so long as she could further Russia's imperialistic aims.

So far germany is literally the only country I know of that is sending heavy weapons from active service military units to ukraine and actively weakening its own forces to do so.

Now in most cases, artillery main use is supression. Your example of hit radius is with specific ammo and a very specific task (when u have constant line of sight and correction). Russia does the same thing just with more batteries and cluster MLRS (that are faster at disrupting and countering any fleeing attempt). Russian doctrine of artillery made them quite logistically heavy in ammo (push logitic model vs NATO pull) but totally weak in managing human neccesities.

We dont know Ukraines losses nor their enemies (Ukraine own statistics are simply propaganda). Just Russia can suffer those losses as long as it isnt manpower so the fighting capability hit is temporary. Ukraine cant even if equipment loss is half of that of Russia in your example (i hope its atleast 3 to 1).

By war economy again only a section of army deal in logistics and tiny ammount in the economy. So i have no idea what u mean by focusin on logistic industry as ukraine has little vehicle production even in civilian sector.

https://www.businessinsider.de/politik/deutschland/software-probleme-aerger-mit-griechenland-lange-lieferzeiten-wie-schwierig-es-um-die-versprochenen-schweren-waffen-aus-deutschland-steht/

So... Context here: M270 aka MARS II - timeline given in tbe article is not winter, but September/October.
Germany has 40 of them, of which only around 20 are actually fit for service, so the military isn't exactly keen on giving 4 of them away, plus there is the required software update, which apparently isn't even ready yet and still needs to be programmed before it can be deployed.

Marders are where the winter timeline comes into play, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they aren't ready yet and need to be updated/refurbished before they can be delivered. Secondly, Greece doesn't want to provide their equipment to Ukraine until they've not only received but customised all 50 Marders. 

Only stuff on track for a June/July delivery right now appear to be Gepards. 


So in summary... Yeah. German military technology is pretty goos, but the state of the German military organisation and its service readiness and ability to get stuff going and general bureaucracy is shocking and embarrassing. Not helped by a somewhat reluctant Bundeskanzler, obviously.

So it's pretty late for Germany to suddenly find itself feeling too guilty to pay for its own defence. Is it that in 1990s they suddenly grew a conscience for events 5 decades earlier, or that in 1990s they suddenly noticed the threat to their own territory receding? In which case it's pretty infuriating that when the Russian tanks were lined up on German borders, they expected the US, UK, etc to maintain powerful militaries to earnestly throw into defending Germany should it be attacked, but when the Russian tanks are lined up on the Polish border Germany doesn't see the point of paying for an army to potentially come to Poland's aid. 

Also, ""Wandel Dutch Handel"" might actually have some merit *if the price of aggression is losing that trade*, so why is Germany the last country to sanction Russia for that aggression? How can German politicians argue that the trade is too valuable for Russia to risk losing by starting a war, then not actually taking away the trade when Russia starts a war?

339,[],False,,LeafsInSix,,,[],,,,text,t2_49mmyaur,False,False,"&gt;I'm honestly wondering at this point: does Germany want Ukraine to lose?

In a certain way, it seems that the prospect of Ukraine's defeat wouldn't bother Scholz and other Putinversteher as much as it would peers in the Anglosphere or Eastern Europe (outside Hungary).

In a similar way, I was struck by how Scholz recently declared openly that ""[Putin must not win this war](https://www.dw.com/en/putin-must-not-win-this-war-germanys-olaf-scholz-tells-davos/a-61938607)"". 

Why not declare that ""Ukraine must win""? Why use Putin as **the** point of reference when Ukraine is the victim of Russian aggression?

Putin not winning, however defined, doesn't necessarily mean that Ukraine or Zelenskyy wins. It could very well be that Putin will merely lose more than Zelenskyy or Ukraine. Yet that ""loss difference"" won't resurrect the dead Ukrainians so far, that won't undo the atrocities at Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kramatorsk and Mariupol, that won't remove the fact that any Ukrainian counterattack must somehow succeed in regaining even more territory which has been lost after Russia's latest rape-invasion started.",b75a49df71aa125749a9984d06632cec941bc69e,True,False,,,,,0,1654728246,,0,{},ibnypac,False,t3_v7z3s4,False,True,t1_ibnr62q,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7z3s4/more_german_excuses_apparently_their_m270s_need_a/ibnypac/,1654728258,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654699446.0,

419,[],False,,LeafsInSix,,,[],,,,text,t2_49mmyaur,False,False,"The sentiment is also compounded by German society taking on so much guilt from the world wars (rather West Germany during the Cold War. East Germany was never quite like this because of the Soviets gladly and cynically ascribing imperialism and Nazism wholly on the capitalist western successor state).

This meant that enough Germans leaned into pacifism (arguably to an unreasonable degree) and also became circumspect about nationalism. Germans eventually couldn't fathom collectively that anyone (especially the Russians who descend from victims of Operation Barbarossa) could sink back to the same depravity that enveloped Nazi Germany in the 1930s. This naivety/intellectual blind-spot fed even more popular support for the policy of ""Wandel durch Handel"" (change through trade). The name of the game was integrating others economically which would then make aggression next-to-impossible. There'd also be no need for anything more than a token military - especially when everyone knows that the US Army is there, so even more resources could be chanelled into non-military pursuits.

By classic microeconomic theory, ""Wandel durch Handel"" is valid in a world where all actors involved are profit-maximizing and whose utility is measurable in how much money, goods or services they each receive after every transaction.

When we instead have people like Russians whose notion of maximizing utility also includes military conquest or subjugation to feed a sense of ethnic superiority or to scratch an emotional itch by indulging in imperialist nostalgia, policies that focus on mere mutual financial enrichment are dangerously inadequate.

From Russia's point of view, maintenance of force projection through the naval base in Crimea and supporting frozen conflicts in Donbass aren't financially/economically beneficial but they sure as hell still *are* rational given a suitable geopolitical thinking which ultimately short-circuits ""Wandel durch Handel"".",2ebfe581bc28a1692b94829a268553138ba25f76,True,False,,,,,0,1654727302,,0,{},ibnwpjz,False,t3_v7z3s4,False,True,t1_ibnrzku,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7z3s4/more_german_excuses_apparently_their_m270s_need_a/ibnwpjz/,1654727313,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654698502.0,

So what's their plan? Use the cleared port to try and land troops in Odesa? 

Use cargo ships to bring troops into the port? 

Mix of both, use the cargo ships as shields while bringing landing ships into the port, and trust that Ukraine won't risk firing on the warships when they might also damage civilian vessels? 

Force the cargo ships to go through ""inspections"" in Odesa and steal the grain? Which would be stupid, since it would only work once. 

The only way to secure those shipments would be NATO ships securing the shipping lane, and probably NATO troops stationed in the port.

They also had around 300 122mm self-propelled guns(Gvozdikas) and also around 300 155mm self-propelled guns(Akatsiyas, Giatsint-S, Msta-S). 

Artillery has been Ukraine's main weapon in this war, but there's a massive issue for them here. They don't produce 122mm or 155mm shells. The Soviet production lines were located in Sverdlovsk, Perm, Tula, and so on - in the RSFSR. The Ukrainians have been burning through their stockpiles, burning through tens of thousands of shells every day since February, while also losing massive amounts to Russian air and missile strikes on depots and warehouses. 152mm stockpiles are now nearly out, and nobody in the world produces meaningful quantites except for Russia. 122mm stockpiles are larger, but those too aren't infinite and it doesn't seem like significant quantities will be delivered from abroad, since it's not like China is gonna help out here.

It is from this perspective that one should look at Western deliveries of howitzers and SPGs. No, we are not even close to supporting them with what they need on a short term. Most of their 1,700 guns are going to be out of commission soon, due to shell shortages, and we are replacing those with a few hundred 155mm guns.

until winter Shortly after the chancellor's announcement that he would supply Ukraine with an air defense system and multiple rocket launchers, a media report points to months of delays. According to Business Insider, the promised Iris-T system should not be ready for use until November or December. Accordingly, the air defense system had previously been ordered by Egypt, which is now to renounce it in favor of Ukraine.  
  
Similarly, it is ordered to the ring exchange with Greece, in the context of which the country is to receive 50 infantry fighting vehicles of the type Marder from the Federal Republic. Originally, Greece was supposed to deliver Soviet models to Ukraine for this purpose.  
  
However, they are mainly stationed on the Greek islands and will probably only be withdrawn when all marten units are delivered ready for use. According to the report, this is also not to be expected until autumn or winter. In addition, the announcement of the exchange was also surprising for manufacturer Rheinmetall, which wanted to sell the martens of Ukraine directly.  
  
There are apparently also difficulties with the multiple rocket launcher Mars II. Four systems were to be delivered – but according to Business Insider, less than half of the 40 German units are operational. In addition, they cannot currently fire ammunition from the USA or Great Britain, a necessary software update could also take months.

We now use arrays that map out the magnetic signatures in MEC or Ordnance and then go investigate them in grid sweeps using magnetometers and then the almighty shovel. 

So if a drone company really wanted to go high speed, one that has a fixed magnetometer at the bottom of it, such as a vallon wide array, they could then again spot a potential piece of ordnance, and then investigate it.

&gt; Last week, Ukrainian media outlets and journalists signed an open letter which... criticized Denisova for including details of cases that the journalists said were unverified and asked her to ""check the facts before publication"" and ""disclose only information for which there is sufficient evidence.""

&gt; The letter went on to say that the information put out by Denisova's office is regarded as factual by the media, and is then used in articles and in speeches by public figures.

&gt; Pavlo Frolov, provided a number of reasons why Denisova was removed, including ""the numerous details of 'unnatural sexual offenses' and child sexual abuses in the occupied territories, which were unsupported by evidence and only harmed Ukraine.""

&gt; He also stated that other reasons for her removal from her post included ""repeated failure to perform her duties related to the establishment of humanitarian corridors"" as well as ""counteracting the deportation of adults and children from the occupied territories.""

&gt; According to military prosecutor Ruslan Kravchuk,  the defendants of the ""tornadoes"" are accused  of: 
-creation of a criminal organization;
-satisfaction with sexual desire in an unnatural way with the threat of physical violence;
- excess of power and official authority by a law enforcement officer, which was accompanied by violence, threat of violence, use of weapons and special means;
- illegal possession of a vehicle with the threat of violence;
-lawful deprivation of liberty and kidnapping;
-torture;
- bringing a person to suicide attempt as a result of ill-treatment;
- arbitrary assignment of power and the title of official, combined with the commission of any socially dangerous acts with the use of uniforms of law enforcement officers;
- illegal entry into the house and illegal inspection of it, committed by an official with the threat of violence;
- extortion committed by an official using his official position and the threat of murder;
-requiring official documents, committed for selfish motives, which led to a violation of the institution;
- illegal possession of a passport of a citizen of Ukraine.
It is noted that the case itself has 86 volumes.

A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of **sexual violence by eight to 10 members of the ‘Azov’ and ‘Donbas’ battalions** in August-September 2014. The victim’s health subsequently deteriorated and he was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.

&gt; Serhiy Melnychuk, who founded the Aidar battalion in eastern Ukraine and is now a member of parliament,

&gt; He conceded some Aidar members ran out of control. “I don’t deny people were looting there (in eastern Ukraine),” he said.
Melnychuk now faces various charges from Ukrainian prosecutors connected to his time in the east. They include robbery and forming an illegal group; Melnychuk denies the charges.
In addition, the human rights group Amnesty International has documented cases of abuse which it says were committed by members of Aidar last year and “amount to war crimes.”

&gt; Andriy Filonenko, a founder of the Tornado battalion, was equally defiant about accusations against his fighters. Eight members of the battalion have been accused of crimes including rape, murder and smuggling. Ukrainian officials say one video shows a re-enactment of how members of Tornado forced two captives to rape another man; they also say some 40 members of the battalion have criminal records.

&gt; “When the Tornado commanders were detained, their mobile phones were seized. There was some scary footage on those phones … footage of sex orgies and rape,” **Tetiana Chornovol told Ukrainian broadcaster 112.
“There were also rapes of underage girls,” she said, adding that “there were even babies. As I understand the baby's mother was forced to do this under the threat of death of her child.”**

According to the Kyiv Post, the unit was comprised in large part of former convicts.

*****
&gt; In two videos, fighters from Russian-controlled east Ukraine complained about poor conditions and long terms of duty at the front leading to exhaustion.

&gt; Russian state television has claimed that those soldiers should be ready to fight for their homeland, but locals have described empty streets and men in hiding to avoid a zealous recruiting campaign in Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.

&gt; Last month, two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus were accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine.

As a young Marxist student Olaf Scholz declared himself to be a conscientious objector and was allowed to work in a care home rather than carry out his military service. Now, as a moderate Social Democrat German chancellor, he opposes Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine but is reluctant to give Kyiv the full means to fight back. The likely result is that when the dust settles, Germany will be seen as one of the war’s losers.  
Scholz’s leadership is marked by foot dragging at crucial moments in the Russian invasion. Day and night artillery barrages are flattening eastern Ukraine. Yet Germany supplies weapons only when under maximum pressure. It tries to sidestep the most effective energy sanctions against Moscow. Scholz continues to think that a solidarity visit to Kyiv would  
be a pointless publicity stunt. Accelerating Ukrainian membership of the European Union, or actively looking for alternative ways of blocking Moscow’s westward incursions, is regarded as too difficult.  
The core problem seems to be that Scholz, who at the outset of the Ukrainian war had announced with some fanfare the need for a sea change in German policy, is asking the wrong questions. At a Catholic conference this week he sat on a podium and asked the audience whether we should be fighting violence with violence. That was typically one of the talking points raised in German conscientious objection tribunals in the Cold War to test whether a candidate for military exemption was trying to swing the lead. It was a sophomoric question and not the issue of the hour. Which is: how does the West stop Putin’s attempts to tear up the European security order? What tools are available? How does the alliance act when a non-member is attacked?  
Scholz ducks and weaves because he lacks the confidence to help shape Nato policy. Instead he is in a state of drift. Initially Ukraine was risibly offered 5,000 helmets by Germany. Then Scholz came up with his impressive-sounding sea change — Zeitenwende — speech, offering an extra €100 billion for Germany’s defence. It turned out the sum was actually a way of  
meeting its long-neglected Nato commitment to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence over the next five years. Other pledges followed and fell short. Germany promised to backfill Poland’s inventories after Warsaw sent tanks to Ukraine, but according to President Duda failed to deliver. Some armour may be coming after training of Ukrainian crews but only deeper into the summer. Light defensive weaponry has made its way into Ukrainian hands but the impression is that Scholz is worried Ukraine will escalate the conflict by firing into  
Russian territory. And he is worried, it seems, about the reputational damage of German panzers again going head to head with the Russians.  
All this goes to show that Scholz has not freed himself from the legacy of the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Like Schröder, whose father died as a private in the pioneer corps retreating from Russia, he has long agreed with the premise that Russian energy imports were a way of guaranteeing Putin’s good behaviour. Like Schröder he saw maintaining good relations with Moscow as a strategic imperative. Though they come from  
different generations, both were Young Socialists at a time when American sabre-rattling was seen as more destabilising than what Russia did in its backyard. This view was shared by many Germans but is now under challenge from conservative foreign policy thinkers like Norbert Röttgen who in an impressive new book takes both his former party leader Angela Merkel and Scholz to task. “We outsourced our energy to Russia, our growth market to China, our security to the US,” he writes. It was the German duty to reclaim its sense of agency. “If we don’t defend it, we will lose it.”  
Instead of trying to overcome German anxiety about being involved in (another) shooting war, the priority should be in getting Berlin to think more deeply about rebuilding post-war Ukraine. Better surely to lean on Scholz’s previous experience as finance minister than on his patchy grasp of the Donbas battlefield. And build on a positive consensus about the German  
post-war experience of the Marshall Plan in stabilising the economy, constructing modern state institutions and creating security. It won’t be easy. Estimates suggest at least $600 billion will be needed; there is no idea yet of how the war will end, whether Ukraine will be partitioned, whether Russia tries to manipulate a fake ceasefire.  
But Scholz will have a chance to exhibit some toughness in dealing with Putin. One open question will be whether the billions of dollars of oligarchical and Russian state assets frozen under sanctions can be confiscated and turned into a kind of reparations fund for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to a Davos audience, made a powerful point: “If the aggressor loses everything, then it deprives him of his motivation to start \[another\] war. Values must matter when global markets are being destabilised.”  
This will be a legal nightmare, one demanding financial expertise and a great deal of stubbornness: let Germany work on the options now rather than live in naive expectation of it becoming a decisive arms supplier for Ukraine. We have discovered already that given the years of German under-investment in defence, counting on its weapons is like squeezing blood out of a stone. Instead of guns and guts, better by far that Berlin concentrates on being an enthusiastic part of a western masterplan to turn post-war Ukraine into a modern, resilient state rather than Putin’s satellite.",9c6e6b6a95a06044942b9e02f2d9029a299aa60b,True,False,,,,,0,1654720315,,0,{},ibnhd34,False,t3_v7yjtl,False,True,t3_v7yjtl,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7yjtl/mars_2_mlrs_promised_by_scholz_possibly_delayed/ibnhd34/,1654720330,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654691515.0,

No, I don't.

&gt;They could have done it with 50 Democrat senators. They chose not to.

Manchin and Sinema exist. You've got 48 democratic senators who will vote for it, and two who, as you said, serve special interests and won't vote for anything unless their donors approve it.

This is what we warned about back during citizens united and I don't fucking mean the democratic party.

I don't disagree with most of what you said here, but don't insult me by telling me what I believe.

What these people want is power.

&gt;Build Back Better would have failed if there were 60 Democrats in the Senate,

Nah, once they actually get their buts in seats people stop believing the ""we can't do anything"" bullshit.

And yes, it's Manchin and Sinema. 

ACA only got passed because Specter rejoined the democrats, and Al Franken won his election. Those 60 votes were used to pass the ACA.

That was the last big legislation to get done, and it only happened because the Dems had 60 votes. And when infrastructure is falling apart, inaction on gas hurts business, and the republicans are challenging the mouse, there are some factors that bring the donor class around to the Democrats, especially during a presidential election season where the Dems want to give Ukraine guns, and the Republicans like Russia.

As for this ""choice,"" they're not killing the filibuster because they want to block shit. The republicans *also* want to block shit. So there's an uneasy agreement not to touch the filibuster. And they couldn't overrule it because they don't have 50 votes to do so.

&gt; The Rich only wanted airlines and (infrastructure) construction companies to get a gov't handout.

What's the difference between the government buying things and a government handout?

Because it seems like you're arguing that any time the government does anything it's a handout.

This isn't like fucking West Virginia with its bridges to nowhere, our bridges are literally falling down. Doing basic maintenance we've been ignoring since the Reagan administration because of government cuts isn't a ""handout.""

Stop fucking lecturing me about things I already know. Money in politics is corrosive in this country and is getting worse since Citizens United killed the reform efforts. 

But also, the ACA passage proves that yeah, the Dems do get shit done in the senate when they get 60 votes.

Currently there are 48 reliable ones, and that's not enough.

Learn to count dude.

Two things can be true at once. These people absolutely serve special interests but that's because most of them are politicians with actual political beliefs who want their names in the history books and to brag about their legacy and accomplishments, and that means delivering on all these grand plans each of them has. These people are true believers in *themselves,* not some high minded political idea. That goes for all the reformers like Bernie and Warren, too.

Your cynicism is insufficient. And yes, money gets people elected in the US and that's a problem. And yes, politicians primarily work for the donor class. 

But if you don't see that these people have self interests and the way Biden is positioning his administration to take advantage of the most powerful monied interests in the country, and choosing to put the republicans in a space where they can either betray organized money or look weak to their voters, then your cynicism is insufficient.

Watch Florida. The rule there since the 50s has been that you don't fuck with the mouse.

Guess what Desantis did?

Again, they might fail. Notice I said them, not ""us."" But there is a strategy here. And it takes organized money into account.",795a3b368d7e34f1a42e3c99baf1ca2449baae91,True,False,,,,,0,1654720301,,0,{},ibnhbxm,False,t3_v65b4o,False,True,t1_ibnclu9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v65b4o/either_this_war_is_the_end_of_putin_or_its_only_a/ibnhbxm/,1654720313,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654691501.0,

&gt; Russia is allegedly threatening Ukrainian servicemen with direct missile strikes on their homes unless they surrender, lay down their arms or side with the invaders, according to a report issued Wednesday by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

&gt; The threats are being sent in direct messages to Ukrainian soldiers via SMS or mobile messaging platforms like Telegram or WhatsApp, the report said.

&gt; The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine&amp;#039;s Defense Ministry said in its report that the intimidation attempts are meant to decrease morale, sow doubt and destabilize the &amp;quot;Psychological climate&amp;quot; among Ukraine&amp;#039;s troops.

American democracy at this moment is 435 Congressmen and 100 senators, and none of them work for you, even though at least two of them are supposed to.  

Even when ""your"" party has 60 senators in a session (which is not a *supermajority*), they're not ""in control"", because they need all 60 of them to approve ""talking"" about legislation, before they can actually vote for legislation.  Other than the period after WW2, it was actually *infrequent* for the Senate to have 60 members of the same party.  Laws used to get passed all the time without one party having ""control"" of the Senate.  

The problem with progress today is not the filibuster, its the politicians.  They're not working for you; they're working to the rich, who helped get them there, and more important, will have a lucrative job waiting for them after they leave office.

This is your mistake.  You actually believe their bullshit that they claim to be working for the people.  No, they do not work for you.  The Senate is all kabuki theatre.  The Democrats never needed 60 senators in order to get their deficit breaking ""New Deal"" legislation passed.  They could have done it with 50 Democrat senators.  *They chose not to*.

But they have to pretend that they wanted the US gov't to further go into hock, so mothers across the nation could have pre-school care paid for by the federal gov't.  They only wanted airlines and (infrastructure) construction companies to get a gov't handout.  So the Democrat party ran a con on the Democrat voters they claim to represent.  Rich people would get the gov't to spend (Infrastructure Bill), but when it came to ""giving handouts"" to the general public (Build Back Better), ""oh, suddenly Joe Manchin had a problem with the spending (or it would have been Sinema)"", and because of our ""arcane"" Senate rules, too bad progressives that wanted a bill passed to help the general public.  Build Back Better would have failed if there were 60 Democrats in the Senate, because 10 of them would have objected to the BBB proposal, and the bill would not have gone to the floor.  Because elected leaders don't work for you, general public peasant.   And you voters are too stupid to understand ""the Game"".

&gt; So you mean gridlock, not control.

There is no gridlock, there is just a really easy excuse that you will fall for, for gov't not passing legislation to ""help you out"".

Once you learn from your mistakes, you should be able to predict things, like who will be voted into office in November.      You should not be judging things like ""why my elected representatives"" failed.  You should be asking ""what did my elected reps *deliver*"", followed by, ""why do they not respect my vote?"".",506539d345a45e8e05899dc3980c1361ce705f27,True,False,,,,,0,1654718277,,0,{},ibnclu9,False,t3_v65b4o,False,True,t1_ibjseer,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v65b4o/either_this_war_is_the_end_of_putin_or_its_only_a/ibnclu9/,1654718291,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654689477.0,

What's good is that Ukraine is starting to get relevant numbers of artillery pieces, mostly because they all add up. With captured pieces and starting arsenal, Ukraine has maybe up to 300 self propelled howitzers, with up to 100 extra from allied countries.  


Now if you count the losses, meaning 40 for Ukraine and 120 for Russia, it's a 3-1 loss ratio. Russia has a well over 4-1 advantage. Basically Ukraine will need much more artillery, as in 150 extra just to get the 3-1 ratio.

But even the T-14, with the unmanned turret and greater protection for the crew, would be interesting to see in terms of survivability.

Also meshes better with the smaller size for each BTG compared to a standard battalion.

It's tiring for the enemy and many of their weapon systems might not have the elevation to target the hill properly alongside other issues. 

The problem is the artillery. Being on a hill can be better versus artillery fire because of firing angles but it can also cause some issues with your own artillery for those same reasons. But once you are dialed in by a drone, even if you are on a hill, you will have to abandon your defenses and take cover. 

I doubt either side will go for a direct assault. They will sit and shell each other until the Russians try to make a breakthrough on the flanks. Special forces teams might try to infiltrate the town during night time operations.

Let's ignore the effects of higher break down rates, poorly maintained barrels etc and assume it is a solid but more antiquated system.  A m777 has a hit radius of around 3m at 20km.  A typical traditional artillery was 50m at 20km.  So you actually need even more systems to achieve a similar result.  If you use 4 guns to achieve the same effect as 1 gun, you need 4x the crew, 4x the ammo, 4x the diesel, etc.  This is just for standard missions, then think about counter battery or trying to say hit targets reinforcing the east.  Way harder logistically.  

How many artillery pieces is Ukraine losing a week versus getting in?  Frankly pretty hard to determine a daily attrition rate but overall Ukraine is getting to fire and pull back and Russia isn't.  For instance Ukraine claims to have destroyed including 9 artillery and 6 MLRS systems yesterday.  So are you saying Ukraine is losing a similar amount daily?

The so called ring swap allows former soviet countries to donate their legacy soviet equipment to Ukraine by backfilling their inventory with shiny new Nato systems. Germany can't just give Ukraine a Leopard and call it a day. For the same reason you don't see Abrahams rollin through the Donbas now. Or F16 flying through Ukraine.

Heavy weapons are very complex by their nature and not only needs training for its use but also for the repairs and maintainance. You seem to confuse regular atillery like the M777 with self propelled artillery systems like the PHZ2000 that Ukrainians are now training on in Germany. Standard towed and ""dumb"" self propelled artillery works more or less the same. They are mechanical systems that get diled in on a trajectory and shot. Bunch of wheels and math. 

The PHZ is highly complex self adjusting arty capabel of firing in rapid succession and connecting to radar and counter radar systems. It is maybe the most advanved artillery system out there. The Hungarians recently trained 6 months to be able to use them and they still shout the commands in German. Ukrainians are set to 40 days...

They retreated from the Kiev front to Belarus with the rest of the Russian forces in late March. The whole of April was a period of intense fighting over the Izyum raion of Kharkov. A signficant number of units  that were withdrawn from the Kiev and the Chernigov-Sumy front were deployed to Kharkov, namely the Izyum and Kupyansk raions that border the Donbass, while the rest of the Russian troops in Kharov, in the Kharkov raion(which encircles the city of Kharkov) and Chuguev raion(directly east of Kharkov Raion) made a slow but steady fighting retreat towards the Russian border and Izyum/Kupiansk. 

So I find it incredibly unlikely that the 29th CAA was deployed to those regions of Kharkov Oblast(Kharkov, Chuguev raions) that were relegated to be slowly retreated from as the Russians shortened the frontlines, instead of being deployed to the epicentre of the fighting, Izyum. Meaning, I'm pretty sure that the 29th has been based around Izyum raion since mid-to-late April, where they currently are.

The question everybody should be asking when talking about Russia and mass mobilization is: why haven't they done it yet, when they clearly stand to gain a lot by doing so and stand to lose almost everything if they don't?

There are lots of theories regarding this, but personally I believe that either they can't because they simply don't have the ability to supply a force large enough to make a difference in Ukraine, or the generals and Putin know that they have to first admit that they are losing the war to do so. On top of this, instituting a draft would likely lead to massive protests/riots, defection and desertion. It would be the Russian equivalent of what the Vietnam war was for USA, except I don't believe Russia as we know it would exist in the aftermath.",1fdb4285c60cd5b589f3bb8e2d16fd5280a564a2,True,False,,,,,0,1654708339,,0,{},ibmp7qi,False,t3_v7qu8v,False,True,t1_ibmnos8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7qu8v/severodonetsk_becomes_a_huge_mass_grave_for/ibmp7qi/,1654708357,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654679539.0,

The article is a bit over simplified.  The M270, known as the MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System).  Is essentially the same as the HIMARs.  The difference ebeing that the MLRS has double the capacity and is based on the tracked chassis of a Bradley IFV.   Whereas the HIMARs has the same launcher on the back but it's only have the size.   Each can fire the full range of rockets and missiles.  The MLRS is better at moving around a battlefield as its tracked.  But its easier to get the HIMARs to the battlefield as it doesn't need a transporter to get there and as its wheeled.  It also needs less maintenance. 

The really annoying thing is that Britain signed a treaty to ban the use of cluster bombs and anti-personnel land mines.  As the best rocket for the MLRS/HIMARs is an anti-tank/anti-personnel cluster bomb dispenser.  That can spread the bombs over a 1KMx1KM area.  Which gives it the name, ""The Grid Buster"" as it can wipe out one grid on a map.  Although you really want three rockets to make sure.  The Americans should however still have them in stock.  However Ukraine signed the treaty in '99 and ratified it in '05.  Although nobody could blame them for breaching it but it wouldn't be good PR and could leave unexploded munitions across the battlefield for decades.   Although there will be decades worth of clean ups anyway.

There are currently ten nations out of thirty meeting the required defense spending levels, 5 of which reached the allotted 2% just last year.

This lack of willingness is just a reality of the lack of a common bonding for most European states, Germany could give two shits about anyone inside of Europe and most of the other states have the same idea about anyone not geographically related to them. See most of these nations can posture and act very selfish because they already belong to NATO what do they have to worry about all they have to do is cry a little and the US will gallivant across the world and save them, this reality changes how European states view their security concerns and allows for a nonchalant response to the Ukraine crisis because it wont reach home because they are protected by this invisible force-field that is US power projection. Its why you see such a varied response from nations and the degree of reaction is directly related to how each nation views its own security concerns.",bf24657df446e1d6574f81f67a1084dff7e77562,True,False,,,,,0,1654706064,,0,{},ibmjrp1,False,t3_v7s9yg,False,True,t1_ibmezru,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7s9yg/still_no_arms_deliveries_from_germany_despite/ibmjrp1/,1654706074,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654677264.0,

Their military is much better equipped than Ukraine’s and is already set to NATO standard. And then there’s the whole fact that an amphibious landing is the hardest military operation to pull off. Think that Russian attempted river crossing from last month, except the entire invasion is like that.

Oh, and then there’s the sanctions, which would do 10x the damage to China given both how dependent they are on Western markets for exports as well as needing to import a huge amount of food and energy just to keep the lights on and not starve.

If you looked at polls there still was a big anti EU sentiment in Ukraine you even had a Putin bootlicker elected as President. Hard to blame anyone in the West that they were sceptical about Ukraine.

&gt;Look at Schroeder, Merkel, Scholz...
I do and they are all in favor for the EU even if Schröder is one giant a**hole.  

&gt; The idea of the EU? Let me guess... ""what is good for Germany is good for the EU""? This idea? Because this is how German foreign policy looks like from the East.

Okay i see you are one of those Anti EU Shills who don't understand the bare minimum about how it works.
Beside that everyone in the EU is doing better than ever since they joined. And just because you are so focused on Germany i'll give you a small tip if Ukraine wants to join the EU you will have a steap hill to climb. All the net constributors to the EU Budget (namely: Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Ireland) will have a say in this and if you think Germany is a problem well you will be in for a surprise.

Time is absolutely a factor but semi permanent lines doesn't actually win either side the war.

That is why all these initial arms transfers from a variety of NATO countries is important to get basic materiel to hold the lines to the front while the full pipeline is set up.

People's Deputy, who left for the occupied Kherson region, confessed to collaborationism
Ukrainian Pravda
3 minutes

People's Deputy Alexei Kovalev, who left for the occupied Kherson region, admitted that he cooperated with the Russian invaders and supported the possible annexation of the region to Russia.

Source: Kovalev's facebook page

Kovalev's direct speech: ""Yesterday (June 7 - UE) I visited a very important event for me, and for all farmers in our region - First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Sergei Kiriyenko met with farmers in the Kherson region.

First, they said that Russia is here seriously and for a long time! Secondly, at the meeting we voiced all our questions and wishes.

Full-scale integration of Kherson agrarians into Russia's economic model is planned.

I think I will say not only about myself, but also about the rest of the participants of the meeting - people came out with the realization that Russia hears and understands us.

In addition to agrarian issues, the status of the Kherson region was also discussed - I will repeat that Russia is forever and the closest integration with Russia is already underway. ""

Details: In his publication, the traitor MP also said that the occupation administration had instructed Ukrainian farmers on what and how to grow them and where to export their grain for sale.

He added that the Russian invaders will attract Kherson businessmen to the Russian economy.

Prehistory:

    In early April, Kovalev wrote on his Facebook page that he had gone to the Naked Pier in the Kherson region, despite the Russian occupation, because ""he has to work in his district."" On April 25, the leadership of the parliament stated that they did not know where Kovalev was and what he was doing.
    On April 28, the Servant of the People faction announced that it had suspended its membership in the party and the faction, and would also turn to law enforcement. The People's Deputy communicates with the Russian military in the Kherson region. According to him, there is no threat to his life and health, which has caused fears among the Ukrainian authorities about his possible work for the occupying country.
    On May 3, deputies expelled Kovalev from the Servant of the People faction.
    At the end of 2021, it became known that the deputy from the ""Servant of the People"" Alexei Kovalev bought ""Channel 4"" from former Deputy Dmitry Dobrodomov.
    In December 2021, the People's Deputy caused a resonant accident on the route ""Kyiv - Odesa"".",3153be714ae10a7f3b66f25db96ab2da6af8910a,True,False,,,,,0,1654703257,,0,{},ibmd2ev,False,t3_v7sflw,False,True,t1_ibmboji,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7sflw/traitor_in_servant_of_the_people_party_farmers/ibmd2ev/,1654703268,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654674457.0,

\-Germany could have and should have made itself less dependent on Russian gas, very obviously; the decisions, including not building LNG terminals, or turning off nuclear energy were not Merkel's alone, though. As I have argued elsewhere, we are now beginning to get a clearer picture of business leaders -- in Austria, it's actually becoming crystal clear in the case of Rainer Seele -- colluding with Russia to make countries more dependent on Russian fossile fuels. I've lived in the German state of NRW, and let's just say that energy firms there do draw red lines that no German chancellor can cross, whether their name is Merkel or different.  


That said, I wonder if different economic policy alone would have been enough to prevent the war. It is pretty clear now that economic considerations do not stop Putin these days, because he is thinking on the genocidal maniacal level of historic claims to territory or the non-existence of nations.   


\-Regarding Ukraine in NATO, and whether such a membership would have stopped the war, I see the point, but am doubtful if Germany was the only problem. They were at least honest in stating their position - I'm sure no one here is so naive as to believe that Turkey or Hungary wouldn't have been spoilers in their own right  
(We'll see if we ever learn the truth behind the accusations against Hungary; the war might well have been a settled deal last year).  


Theoretically, yes, Merkel could have stopped the war.

In an email to selected security politicians on Wednesday, the federal government informed that there had been ""no additions"" to the weapons delivered since the week.

As a result, the federal government will not display an updated delivery list in the secret protection agency of the Bundestag. Normally, the federal government deposits an updated list of arms deliveries in the secret protection agency on a weekly basis. The papers can only be seen by a few MEPs, but they are not even allowed to take notes. The government justifies this with security considerations, since Russia could attack transports to Ukraine if it announces deliveries freely.

DER SPIEGEL reported last week, citing German and Ukrainian sources, that German deliveries have been stagnating for several weeks 
. In fact, mainly spare parts have been added to the list in the last few weeks. Chancellor Scholz, meanwhile, publicly claimed on Tuesday that Germany was one of Ukraine's ""most important military supporters"" and was supplying ""large quantities"" of weapons.",b31ce867b082e3cc2b6bb204b0fe5affa5b8d8ff,True,False,,,,,0,1654702133,,0,{},ibmaey4,True,t3_v7s9yg,False,True,t3_v7s9yg,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7s9yg/still_no_arms_deliveries_from_germany_despite/ibmaey4/,1654702149,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654673333.0,

from the wikipedia:  


The benefits of alpine style include spending much less time on the route, thereby reducing objective dangers such as avalanches or blizzards. This can be a major factor on routes with ice fields full of blocks of ice hundreds of feet tall which could fall at any time. Snow and icy conditions often change over the course of a day forcing climbing parties to climb in the early hours before the sun melts the snow or ice making it unsuitable and more susceptible to avalanche. This tendency to climb in the morning has led to the term ""Alpine Start"". An ""Alpine Start"" is an early start that ranges from starting at 11:00pm of the night before on long routes, to not long before sunrise for shorter routes or faster parties. An ""Alpine Start"" must begin in the dark.

*****
&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko has described Vladimir Putin as &amp;quot;Absolutely rational, cold, cruel, black evil&amp;quot; and claimed he is determined to go down in Russian history alongside Stalin and Peter the Great.

&gt; In an exclusive interview, Tymoshenko dismissed the suggestion that the Russian president was &amp;quot;Crazy&amp;quot;.

&gt; As Russian bombs fell, Tymoshenko took refuge in the basement of the modern office building belonging to her Batkivshchyna political party in Kyiv&amp;#039;s Podil district, which was hit several times by missiles.

No, our entire planet isn't dependent on just Ukraine and Russia, it doesn't have to be for there to be food shortages.

To put it simply:

&gt;Ukraine has been one of the world’s largest contributors to the World Food Programme – the UN agency that provides food aid to countries in crisis. The Head of the WFP – David Beasley estimates that it provides 40% of its wheat. 

Now, you can't simply go out and seed some land, food production tends to be planned in advance, keeping in mind things like supply and demand. After all, you don't want to grow a crop you can't sell. So it's not like farmers all around the world have suddenly been growing more wheat, and even if such a shift was being set in motion it won't help with anything soon anyway.

Secondly, less stuff on the market, with the same demand as before, means higher prices, and this may come as a surprise, but that means prices go up *everywhere*.

Now by the sound of things you live nicely up your own ass, but besides what the UN distributes there are still millions of people out there that rely on cheap food, and when food prices go up, they start to run into problems, y'know the one where they can't afford it.

So when European leaders are talking about a ""Food crisis"" that doesn't mean a crisis for you or I, but for people in say Africa who won't get, or can't afford food, due to... drumrolls please... the war in Ukraine! And who started this war in Ukraine?

Ukraine knows not to ask Biden for something like that. No country is going to potentially damage their air defense by giving up Patriot batteries. These are also systems that if they're ever captured, could literally be the end of their effective air defense.

I'm extremely Pro-Ukraine but I'm also still an American and I would be pretty unhappy (to put it mildly) if Biden gave Ukraine Patriot Batteries.  We have these defense systems placed around the world in logical places (there are also tons protecting oil infrastructure in places like UAE and Saudi Arabia, and if a drone gets through and blows up a pipeline hope you like $8/gal gas). There are massive supply chain issues that affect production of the batteries. It's nothing like, say giving Ukraine howitzers or MLRS as those are pretty unlikely to be used to engage any kind of any enemy to our own national security.

Ukraine could ask for weapons systems from Israel that   have actually proven themselves on the battlefield against Russian weapons, in the 2020 Armenia-Azerbijan conflict, and that they're willing to sell. The Azeri weapons, particularly Bayraktars, totally demolished Armenian forces and that conflict was a good preview of the Russia-Ukraine War, and one I think Ukraine studied a ton and Russia not at all. I believe that Israel was the second largest seller of arms to Azerbaijan after Turkey. It's hard to overstate how quick and decisive the Azeri's victory was.

Indtead of asking for relevant weapons systems that Israel might sell, Ukraine asks for something they know they can't get but everyone knows the name of so it will be in the news and embarrass Israel. If I worked for the Israeli State Department I would be very annoyed at Ukraine and would ask them to knock these kind of theatrics off.",95d751ae1c2ad3feb12147016a4d929002893d12,True,False,,,,,0,1654695582,,0,{},iblvsj5,False,t3_v796uq,False,True,t1_ibl7sjc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v796uq/ukraine_seeks_to_purchase_iron_dome/iblvsj5/,1654695599,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654666782.0,

Plus, army qualifications simply qualify you to speak on a very specific topic in a specific field. It doesn't mean because you're an infantry guy you know about the mechanics of artillery deployments. A lot of this knowledge is very specific to your particular field of expertise. 

I was here in 2014, around the time Bellingcat was making its name, pouring over maps and information alongside everyone else and I've got reasonable understandings of things based on the knowledge of various experts in different fields that I have no direct knowledge of.

In this sub back in 2014-15 is when we first really started seeing drone warfare come into use. Everyone here acts as if it is some new thing. It's been going on for years at this point.  

I'm not qualified to teach a military class and I wouldn't presume to, but I think I have enough of an understanding to look at maps, videos, reports and come to some basic conclusions which may be fleshed out later on. 

E.g. many people think the tank is somehow ""now"" obsolete, yet they were mysteriously absent when ISIS and Syrian tanks in general were getting obliterated by the mass use of ATGMs, drones and air power. 

There is this opinion that war has now changed, even though both sides have been using more or less the same rule-book for 8 years at this point.

The Ukrainians executed the longest armoured thrust since WW2 during 2014 and there are plenty of lectures by actual military experts on the use of Ukrainian armour back during 2014 and beyond. They encountered all the similar problems we see today. They settle into trench warfare and use drones and artillery, with the majority of the armour in reserve or used piecemeal as either static defense or simply direct fire artillery.

The invasion was an unmarked military force. Russia has motivated Ukrainians to violate the rights of Russian speakers in the area and is going to defend the Russians. The real goal was to look at the reaction of the countries of the world and obtain the exportable resources - coal, as well as metal ores. 

The Russians formed a referendum on the secession of areas from Ukraine. They even added Crimea to their country. The election, just like in Soviet times, brought in its own Russian agitation actors and played theater professionally. Everything happens under one scenario for many decades, only the occupied territories change.  
Ukrainians have been fighting for the Donbass and Luhansk regions since the beginning of the invasion, only the world's great nations forbade Ukrainians to use heavy artillery and aviation against the Russians so that the Russians would not become angry. So now there is a war.

If the world's great powers had taken a firm stand against Russia at the time, the war might have started in about 10 years. With Russia, everything is only a matter of time, because they cannot live in peace - they cannot work and develop. They like to drink, rob, fight, and ridicule the weak or the strong who have been bound or otherwise incapable of resisting. It will not happen without war.

In order to justify this war with Ukraine in the opinion of their people, they invested in propaganda, saying that Ukrainians are killing young children.

That's why Israel unlike Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq Etc, Israel is a thriving DEMOCRACY, where many Israeli Arabs prefer to live.

Germany came better out of covid then the UK, brexit is an utter disaster,... Sorry if you think the UK is good in leadership  ...

&amp;#x200B;

Germany had 1600 death/million due to corona, UK had 2600  . 

Why? Because you seem to think ""trying to divert attention away from internal scandals"" equals good leadership.

Pro active looking at the future and trying to make sure russia doesnt do this is good leadership, letting war happen isnt.

Pro active making sure health care system can deal with something like corona is good leadership, scrambling when it happens and utterly failing to protect people isnt.

&amp;#x200B;

UK is a fine example of short term thinking as well in politicians as in voters, brexit and corona showed this. Germany was a lot better prepared because they have better leadership that looks more into the future.

will always see it acting after the USA. France and Germany are   
significantly larger than other nations. They could push the EU to lead

Cause eu never had the goal to do this, foreign policy was never a goal for the EU. it slowly is coming to that but that will take a while with reforms to achieve that.

After 1991 Russia promised to pull out from all other former SSRs. But Russia didn't pull out fully.  
Russia's occupation troops have been non-stop in Crimea since 1920, in Georgia since 1921 and in Moldova since 1940 - the latter based on the MRP Pact between Hitler and Stalin.  
  
The Kennan Doctrine grew out of medieval Russian Bear Doctrine coined in medieval Livonia (at the time ruled by Baltic germans), based on finno-ugric folklore on bears. For background, Moscow was predominantly volga-finnic until 12th century AD. Basically it means that one should leave bear alone, but if it attacks you then you fight back, and if it continues to trash your property then it is time to skin it and throw a funeral party with dancing afterwards. Kennan was indoctrinated in interwar Estonia and Latvia that comprised the medieval Livonia.

“In Egypt, prices of wheat and sunflower oil have escalated due to Egypt’s reliance on Russia and Ukraine for 85 percent of its wheat supply and 73 percent of its sunflower oil,” the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development said on Thursday.

Germany is not a presidential system, and in fact, a lot of these things happened not because of Merkel, but were done by the entire political spectrum even when she would have preferred otherwise. Merkel never did set German energy policy by herself.  


She did get a lot wrong, but any learning experience from this will need to understand how deeply infiltrated by Russian interests European elites in the economy were, and how business dictated policy areas (like energy) where states should have prevailed. Look at the clusterf\*ck Austrian politicians allowed to happen because our big energy company had a Russian asset for a CEO.  
By putting such things on Merkel, we're missing out on the bigger picture.

Lived in Seoul, South Korea for high school and all the toilets had didet. Honestly I had no clue how I was using gross toilet paper my whole life before this. Fast forward to college (Washington, DC) my African roommate would take a cup of water to the bathroom and when I finally asked what the deal was with the cup of water she told me it’s more hygienic to simply pour the water down the lower part of your back and the let the water stream down to clean. No waste created by used toilet paper and was much more effective at cleaning.

Obviously I could not agree more but I was completed shocked that I didn’t think of a cup before. I thought I needed a bidet style bathroom to clean with but here goes this chick telling me any cup would do. 

I’m in the data industry so I’m curious this toilet paper thing is a good indicator of what exactly? Because I think most of the world is too poor to afford it anyway so the indication that a airline is tightening up their budget has nothing to do with how people are cleaning their asses. I think it’s honestly just a clear indication that people are panicking because the is no trusted social fabric anymore.

I hope all these Isis and Al Qaeda members would get destroyed. But tell me what would happen if Turkey didn't stop Syrian-Russian offensive on Idlib? Another huge refugee wave would come to Turkey and we are all alone with that problem.

&gt;and help refugees return to the regions of Syria were they originated from, rather than put them in ethnically cleansed regions destroyed by Turkey's army and the Jihadist thugs you back.

I would be happy with that. But this doesn't look possible with Erdoğan, i hope we will get rid of him and things will change but we have to solve this problem anyway.

On the hand everyone can see the ties in between SDF and Pkk. Even US officials admits that. [1](https://youtu.be/kVZCIel_2Xw) [2](https://youtu.be/34a2f8moiAg)

Sorry but articles like this are nothing more than bullshit. US is funding, arming the groups Turkey fought for 40 years. But they are talking like we are the one who acts like enemy. SDF leader Mazlum Abdi or Mazlum Kobane(he also rebranded himself for many times) is a former, high ranked Pkk member. Obviously he is not the only one with Pkk  past. Should we also forget his past? Turkey have solid reasons to be against SDF.

Also Turkey took Kurds from Iraq when Saddam was murdering them, Turkey have good relationship with KRG too. So it's not about being a Kurd.",a0e161261d4ac9cbf3a6337618fa2ec449ea0926,True,False,,,,,0,1654692322,,0,{},iblpfhb,False,t3_v7kqaq,False,True,t1_iblnxhq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7kqaq/turkeys_islamist_leader_using_nato_to_get_free/iblpfhb/,1654692336,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654663522.0,

I think there is just one general piece of advice, really. Standardize your new equipment. Yes, it's going to be painful now but with tens of different weapon systems on top of what you already have it will become even more of a nightmare to maintain them. Standardize the ammo as much as possible, standardize the gear. 

It's a catch 22. If you standardize gear now, yes, it will be better for you in 5 years, but you might lose the war in the meantime. 

At some point NATO stocks will also run dry, except for the United States. But then you will become more and more reliant on the US defense industry, which is not exactly a safe bet.

There is also always the risk of russian spies and collaborators giving away locations of arms depots.

The second bottleneck is training. Most of the western heavy weapons systems are new to Ukraine.

I do agree with you that the numbers seem high but I think they're definitely within the realms of possibility. We are seeing a very censored form of the war, almost certainly through propaganda lenses (both UA and RU). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that there are up to 20k mercenaries 'in Eastern Ukraine'; obviously, theres no telling how accurate this is. This includes Wagner, Syrians, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't able to find any details on the current state of the DPR/LPR 'army', but Russia has been issuing passports for people living there for a while now - and has recently accelerated. 

Holding a Russian passport means taking on the duties of a Russian citizen, which can involve forced conscription and I believe may involve mandatory military service at 18, so arguably many LPR/DPR citizens could now be fighting with little say in the matter. 

  
On the Russian (born) army numbers vary, anything from 800k-1.1m, with up to two million reservists - and we've seen reservists fighting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I know that not all of the forces of anyone have been fully deployed, but if these figures are anywhere near true I think theres a possibility. The recent removal of the upper age limit for Russian enlistment is certainly a sign of that IMO.

I will talk about the situation in Turkey. Thanks to Erdoğan's politics right now we have more than 8m refugees and illegal immigrants.

Erdogan is using them to change the way of people's living, he welcomes all illegal immigrants from crazy Muslim countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and I'm talking about young males not families. We already had so many bad things about these and if someone would change this then Turkey will explode at some point.

For most of the people our refugee problem is the priority. Our economy is fucked up but it can get fixed after Erdoğan. So opposition parties are saying that they will make agreements with Assad and send refugees back in safe, personally i don't even care about that anymore. Some leftists, Western funded media like DW etc. are keep saying that we can't send refugees back, they have to stay and integrated. Also they say it would be ethnic cleansing of Northern Syria. 

So people are calling it ethnic cleansing when we plan to send Syrians back to ''Syria'' but they also ask Turkey to keep all refugees here, should i see that normal as a Turkish citizen? Turkish citizens are started be minority in our border cities.

but to the point, lasers would fit the description of tight beam. 

however even being fictional Sci Fi the portrayal can vary depending on how true to life the show happens to be. Consider ""The Expanse"", on that show they try to be realistic about some of the science, particularly with light speed and message. 

In that setting you have to aim the laser to where you expect the recipient to be. Meaning that if light takes 5 minutes to arrive at the recipient, you have to be sure to aim the laser close to where they will be 5 minutes ahead. so you need to know the recipients current location, speed and heading. 

plus over such vast distances, if the recipient changed direction before the message arrived you wouldn't know till after 5 minutes has elapsed because what you see of them was 5 minutes ago. So your message would never reach them.

also, lasers are really just tight cones. over hundreds of millions of miles even a tiny laser beam of fraction of an inch would still spread in size a significant amount, could be hundreds of miles wide by that point. 

but that isn't much of a concern because the recipient target is small and space is incredibly big, so without knowing their current speed/heading/location your laser would miss. 

this also makes it hard for the enemy to intercept your lasered message, provided they aren't next to you. the further they are away the more behind in time they will be, thus making the message of limited use for any immediate actions. 

additionally, it makes it even harder for your enemy to fake a message from you without knowing the recipients current speed/heading/location 

However, on Earth, the distance are so short that none of that really matters, easy enough to coordinate location and targeting the message.

3672,[],False,,zebsdee,,,[],,,,text,t2_9um0yw2,False,False,"&gt;The war in Ukraine, now in its fourth month, defies simple notions of winning and losing. Russian forces are thought to be in control of most of Severodonetsk, a city at the eastern edge of a Ukrainian salient, having beaten off Ukrainian counter-attacks. Ukrainian resistance is now confined to an industrial zone in the westernmost edge of the town. Yet territorial control is ebbing and flowing. Russia’s net gains in eastern Ukraine between the middle of April and the end of May add up to just over 450 square kilometres (about a third of the size of Greater London) according to Rochan Consulting, a firm which tracks the war; hardly a spectacular bounty. Neither Russia nor Ukraine looks likely to make a decisive breakthrough. Instead, each hopes to grind the other down in a war of attrition.  
  
Russia’s losses have been severe. The invasion force that it initially committed to the war had been reduced to about 58% of its pre-war strength by the middle of May, according to a Western official. By June 1st that had fallen by another few percentage points. Russian battalion tactical groups, the basic fighting formations of the Russian army, probably started the war with around 600 men each; recently some have been seen with only 60, barely larger than a platoon. The damage to armour has been especially dramatic. Russia has lost at least 761 tanks, over a third of them since the beginning of the Donbas offensive on April 18th.  
  
Russian commanders are now throwing old equipment into battle. The t-62, a tank which entered service in 1961 and was spruced up in the 1980s, has been spotted in Donbas in recent weeks, some models adorned with improvised “cage armour” bolted on top to provide rudimentary, and probably ineffective, protection against anti-tank munitions. Tom Bullock of Janes, a defence intelligence company, says that such redundant kit is probably destined for the Donetsk People’s Militia, a Russian proxy force, allowing them to hold a defensive line and freeing up the Russian army for more important tasks.  
  
Much less is known about the state of Ukraine’s forces. Western officials are saying nothing that might undermine Ukrainian morale, and there is less open-source evidence, such as imagery on social media, showing its losses. What is clear, though, is that Ukraine has also taken a mauling. On May 31st Volodymyr Zelensky, the country’s president, said that 60 to 100 of his soldiers were dying each day, with 500 more being wounded—loss rates comparable to some battles of the second world war. Western officials say those figures are broadly accurate. One says that Russian and Ukrainian loss rates are now about the same. The morgue in Bakhmut, an immediate destination for Ukrainian soldiers killed in fighting to the east, was reported to be overflowing this week, with bodies left outside on the street.  
  
If the war is settling into a contest of attrition, which side is more likely to prevail? A great deal depends on which country can produce a steadier flow of manpower, equipment and ammunition. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has so far refused to conduct a nationwide mobilisation of reservists and conscripts, but there is evidence that the country’s defence ministry is trying to lure men with military experience back into action with the promise of pay packets as hefty as $5,000 per month—six to eight times the salary of an average lieutenant.  
  
Ukraine’s problem is different. It has an ample source of motivated recruits, but insufficient people to train them. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, says that the number of would-be recruits for the armed forces is so high that there is a waiting list of over a month to be inducted. That suggests that in the short term it will be very difficult to build the six new brigades—25,000 men—that a Ukrainian official recently told the Financial Times would be necessary for a major counter-offensive to take back land in the east and south.  
  
On the face of it, equipment should be less of a problem. America, Australia and European countries have all sent more artillery, ammunition and other arms to Ukraine over the past month. America, Britain and Germany have also promised rocket launchers that can strike around three times farther than those artillery systems. These probably will not come quickly enough to halt Russia’s conquest of Severodonetsk and possibly nearby towns, such as Lysychansk, which Mr Zelensky visited in person on June 5th. The Pentagon says that it will take weeks to train Ukrainian forces on the himars rocket launcher.  
  
But if the war drags on for months or even years, as American and European officials now expect, these foreign weapons will play a vital role. Ukraine is either out of some types of Soviet-standard ammunition or close to it, says Michael Kofman of cna, a think-tank. The stocks of such ammunition in former Warsaw Pact states, like Poland, will also run dry in time. If Ukraine’s army can switch to nato-standard arms, it would allow Western countries to underwrite a much longer campaign. “Even though the local military balance in… Donbas appears favourable to Russia, the overall trends in the military balance still favour Ukraine,” argues Mr Kofman—if, that is, Western support is sustained.  
  
Many European countries are also running low on some of the weapons being sent to Ukraine, such as anti-tank missiles; and it could take years to ramp up production. Nor is it straightforward for Ukraine to absorb the new weaponry. Though Western defence officials have been impressed by the speed with which Ukrainian troops have got to grips with the new kit, maintaining dozens of new and unfamiliar systems in wartime conditions is not easy. The Economist understands that many artillery pieces have already had to be sent back to Poland for repair. Russia still has the advantage in guns.  
  
The Biden administration believes that the $40bn package of assistance signed by the president on May 21st will allow a “high tempo” of military aid to continue until nearly the end of the year. In practice, both sides will need to pause fighting, to rest and rebuild their battered armies long before then. Yet the fighting is then likely to resume. Mr Putin has a cynical view of Western staying power. He believes that European and transatlantic divisions will widen as the war drags on. Higher energy prices, inflation and wider economic disruption might encourage those who want an early ceasefire. “We cannot make that mistake again,” argued Kaja Kallas, Estonia’s prime minister, on June 6th, citing Russia’s land grab in Georgia in 2008 as well as the Minsk deals negotiated by France and Germany after Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “We have to be prepared for a long war.”",27db4cd29838bc9ad898f525b7bcb92908c94617,True,False,,,,,0,1654689803,,0,{},ibll0pl,True,t3_v7nzk7,False,True,t3_v7nzk7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7nzk7/the_conflict_in_ukraine_is_settling_into_a_war_of/ibll0pl/,1654689817,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654661003.0,

Now, he says in an interview, Ukraine’s security service has accused him of being a traitor and arrested and jailed one of his colleagues in the nearby region of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is still under Ukrainian control. He fears he could be arrested, too, but he is currently beyond the reach of Ukrainian authorities in Kherson.

“If you are doctor you will help people, everybody,” says Aleksandrovich. “I’m not a traitor. We are an internet provider – we should help people. This is my duty.”

The Ukrainian security service didn’t respond to a message seeking comment about Aleksandrovich’s allegations.

Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites have provided a lifeline in some occupied areas, enabling internet access when fixed lines are disconnected. But Starlink’s service is not widely used in the country. As of early May, Starlink in Ukraine had about 150,000 active users, according to Ukraine’s vice prime minister. That’s less than 0.5% of Ukraine’s population.

In total, there are more than 700 internet providers based in Ukrainian territories that are currently under Russian occupation, according to Liliia Malon, commissioner of Ukraine’s digital infrastructure and services regulator. All of those providers are vulnerable to Russian interference, Malon says. 

“For the Russian occupiers, it’s a target and objective to destroy our internet infrastructure or just to capture it,” says Malon. “But we really believe and hope this territory will come back to us very soon and this problem will disappear.”",504904c4e6dc2c11a0c18fe9d4c91ca5679afbd8,True,False,,,,,0,1654689726,,0,{},iblkvwl,True,t3_v7nyx4,False,True,t1_iblkvi7,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7nyx4/control_of_ukrainian_internet_is_new_focus_in/iblkvwl/,1654689738,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654660926.0,

**The battle for the internet**

As soldiers in Ukraine continue to fight off Russian advances in the east of the country, another battle is taking place away from the front lines. It’s a war for control of Ukraine’s internet.

In areas of Ukraine under Russian occupation, internet access has often been shut down or disrupted, leaving the local population isolated from the rest of the world. Now, a new trend is emerging: The internet is coming back online, but the traffic is no longer managed by Ukraine. It’s been re-routed to networks owned by the Russian government.

In mid-May, an internet provider called Status in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson was raided by Russian soldiers and its owners forced to connect to a network in Crimea, according to Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. By May 30, Status’s internet traffic had been configured to flow through Miranda Media, a Crimea-based affiliate of the Russian-state owned telecommunications firm Rostelecom, according to the internet monitoring group NetBlocks.

The change means users’ data may now be monitored by a Russian government surveillance system known as SORM, while their ability to freely browse the internet may also be restricted, according to Victor Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine's information protection service.

“Use of the SORM system is unthinkable in Ukraine. These kind of surveillance systems Russia has in place clearly violate human rights,” Zhora says. “The enemy’s objective is to strip our people’s access to true information, making only Russian propaganda available.”

Citizens in occupied cities such as Kherson now face a difficult choice: Be disconnected from the internet and unable to communicate with loved ones, or connect to a network operating under the watchful eye of the Russian state. Many have chosen the latter option—despite the disapproval of Ukrainian authorities.

Hudz Dmitriy Aleksandrovich is the chief executive officer of Skynet, a small internet provider in Kherson. After Russia captured the city in early March, Aleksandrovich’s customers could no longer access the internet and were left isolated from friends and family. The only way he could get them back online was to connect to Miranda, the Russian-controlled network. He decided to do it.",7fb0cfb0c991ad80db28f5648023c1ce5fa516a6,True,False,,,,,0,1654689719,,0,{},iblkvi7,True,t3_v7nyx4,False,True,t3_v7nyx4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7nyx4/control_of_ukrainian_internet_is_new_focus_in/iblkvi7/,1654689730,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654660919.0,

They were poor conservative Muslims farming families, from the north west and west of the country. They grew angry over corruption and jobs going to Alawites (Assad's religion). 

Whats not often discussed is the decade long drought made worse by water resource mismanagement that devastated Syrian farmers, before the Civil War. Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafz, made it state policy to irrigate the land using water from deep boreholes, that helped irrigate the land and kept the Sunni farmers employed and happy. But they paid no regard to saving the finite water resource, that was eventually dried up during a decade long drought. It was so severe it could be detected from spade by gravity measureing satellites, which registered a decrease in gravity billions of gallons of water was sucked out of the ground and evaporitated. 

The drought caused millions of poor farming families to move to the cities. Some believe that drought is integral to understanding the origins of the civil war, a minority think it was only a minor factor. Regardless, many refugees fled to these huge slums and that's were they came from.

anti-tank handguns of the type RGW-90. The modern anti-tank weapons, which are  
used by the Bundeswehr under the name of Matador, were purchased by Ukraine  
directly from the manufacturer and were delivered to Ukraine in two tranches  
from the end of March, following export approval by the German government. https://dn-defence.com/rgw-90/  
·         
1600  
anti-tank directional mines of the type KN57 DM22

These promised deliveries are still outstanding:  
·         
30  
Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks and around 60,000 pieces of ammunition.  
According to plans, the first of a total of 15 Gepard systems from 15 Gepard  
systems from German industry stocks are to arrive in Ukraine in July. Another  
15 are to follow in the course of the summer. The Ukrainian crews of the tanks  
will be trained in Germany at Bundeswehr firing ranges by trainers from the  
manufacturer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flakpanzer\_Gepard  
·         
4  
Mars II multiple rocket launchers from Bundeswehr stocks, these are to be  
delivered to Ukraine by the end of June, according to government sources. The  
Bundeswehr has a total of 22 of the missile launchers. https://www.kmweg.de/systeme-produkte/kettenfahrzeuge/artillerie/mars-ii-mlrs-e/  
·         
7  
self-propelled howitzers of the type PzH 2000 . Delivery of the heavy artillery  
gun, which is mounted on a tank chassis, will probably begin in July. The  
delivery was decided at the beginning of May. At that time, the Netherlands had  
asked Berlin whether they could send five German-made howitzers to Ukraine. The  
German government then decided to put together a larger package and deliver  
seven systems. Ukrainian soldiers are currently being trained on the howitzer  
in Germany, but this is taking somewhat longer than initially hoped because of  
the complexity of the technology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerhaubitze\_2000  
·         
Iris-T  
air defence system. The delivery was decided only a few days ago, Scholz  
announced it in the Bundestag on Wednesday. Ukraine had already requested the  
air defence system from the German manufacturer Diehl Defence in Berlin at the  
beginning of May, but a corresponding application for export was only approved  
a few days ago. According to the manufacturer, the system offers protection  
against attacks by aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and short-range  
ballistic missiles. The delivery to Ukraine, however, will take several more  
months and will probably not take place until late autumn or winter. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIS-T  
·         
Cobra  
radars. Not much is known about the details of the delivery. However, it is  
presumably also a direct purchase by Ukraine from the German arms industry.  
According to the Bundeswehr, Cobra is the world's most powerful artillery  
tracking radar. The main task of the system is the precise localisation of  
enemy artillery, rockets and mortars https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-battery\_radar

Second of all, this kangaroo court illegally sentencing British citizens to death is a pretty good way of telling the UK that the so-called ""DNR"" is a terrorist organization, and that the UK should send everything they can to defeat them, including fighter jets with British pilots and special forces to try and free them, regardless if they need to kill the ""judge"" presiding over this trial, or blow up their prisons. It would just be ridiculously stupid to sentence them to death.

Aside from propaganda value for the brainwashed rusnia masses, this ""trial"" has very little tactical sense.

3891,[],False,,petetakespictures,,,[],,,,text,t2_2ndcb6yo,False,False,"Despite my frustration with the slow-moving Scholz and anger at Schroeder, I can't find it in me to blame Merkel much. First of all there was the kernel of a good idea in there. Make the rewards of doing business with Europe such that Russia would keep chugging along, after all the USSR never cut its energy supplies to Germany even at the height of the cold war. Ironically Merkel did express concern at over-reliance on Russian energy in the mid 2000's, but nobody in Germany seemed overly worried. In 2008 she had good reason to deny Ukraine entry to NATO. Their military WAS corrupt. (Happily now they've transmuted themselves into a shining beacon.)  She did push her German colleagues for imposing sanctions in 2014 over the invasion of Ukraine then, which was a reversal of traditional German Ost-politik where it was felt to be in everyone's interests to always do business with Russia, and at a time when Schroeder (ugh) was trying to whitewash Putin and argue for closer ties. Her speech against Putin delivered in Sydney was fierce. 

She could have done more. There was a gradual shift back to normal after 2017, with trade slowly picking up again with Russia. This should not have happened, and a tougher message of, ""We're willing to take this hurt to remind you that should you try something like this again, we will come at your harder."" I could understand the lure of slowly sliding back into bed with Russian trade, the sanctions cost a lot of German jobs in 2014, but still. She also needed to accept the fact that a new cold war - at minimum - was probably going to happen and that defence funding needed to be boosted. Germany and Russia suffered grievously, horrifically in the war and this led to many young Germans born in the 60s and onwards to have views that very strongly opposed anything they perceived as militarism. Only the need to have a powerful army in the fact of the USSR, and only the Soviet boot on the neck in East Germany had it any other way. Another legacy is the deep, deep fear of nuclear war in Germany. Even a limited tactical nuclear battlefield exchange avoiding escalation in cold war war-games pointed to an uninhabitable Germany. They felt it a lot more keenly on the knife-edge than the rest of Europe and America.  

Come the 90s and reunification and a seemingly bright future, and with the fear of Russia collapsing into civil war and going nuts not happening, there was a sort blind optimism as to any sort of dealing with Russia combined with that belief that tying Russia close to Germany through trade would prevent any war from happening again. There was also the feeling that it was better to have Russia leaning towards us than to be pushed into China's camp. 

Unfortunately the blindness stretched to failing to ignore the signs that Russia was becoming increasingly totalitarian, that her people only viewed Germany as 'lesser enemy' rather than 'potential friend and partner' and that rationality was increasingly (and often literally) out the window in Putin's Russia.    

It's a sin many of us in Western Europe shared, and I can't call out Merkel on her optimism or her belief that sanctions would be enough to warn Russia against further actions when much of Western Europe was feeling the same. Merkel has rightly tried to talk some sense into Putin since the second invasion, but as of a couple of months ago he no longer picks up the phone.  What Merkel needs to do now is to lend her elder-stateman weight to push others into doing more for Ukraine NOW as Russia seems intent on blowing up its own potential off-ramps.

Within 48 hours of the invasion germany reversed decades old policy to not send weapons to such a warzone.

It sows doubt among other Western leaders and the media who consider talk of Ukraine winning and not ceding territory as too one-sided.  

The other side is what Henry Kissinger or Noam Chomsky suggested, that Ukraine might need to cede territory and seek a negotiated settlement much sooner.  

They are not feeling death and destruction.  They do not understand that Ukrainians are also fighting and dying for us. We must support Ukraine that this is the best route to success.

My reaction to the interview was that she was selfish and delusional.  She had the support of the German people. Can’t blame her too much.  Being a civil servant (even an elected one) is an exercise in frustration.

1. People who are serious contenders to be world chess champions in other categories like say world blitz chess champion, world rapid chess champion, world 9LX champion, etc. But I guess not for like world chess champion under 14 or something. 

2. People who have current or peak fide (standard) rating of 2700+. For example David Howell last I checked isn't 2700+ but used to be

3. People who are fide blitz or fide rapid rated 2700+. For example Tigran L Petrosian has been called a supergrandmaster: Petrosian's fide standard rating is below 2700 but the guy's fide peak or current blitz rating is 2700+.

See the ff re Petrosian:

https://youtu.be/DvWxyjLy828 --&gt; at 0:34 the speaker calls Petrosian a superGM.

https://www.reddit.com/r/copypastaphil/comments/usy22k/wesley_so_vs_tigran_l_petrosian_copypasta/

4. You can extend this to women like say superWGM is 2500+ since women's ratings are about 200 points lower than men's ratings. But usually this is synonymous with female GM since the GM rating requirement is 2500+. (As you can expect the WGM rating requirement is 2300+.)

Lessons to be learned: Putin is unpredictable, and he has no words. He only understands force, which means that to end this war, the Russian army will have to be totally routed.

&gt; Anthony Coley, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, said on Twitter that the superyacht had set sail for the U.S. under a new flag, and that American authorities were grateful to police and prosecutors in Fiji &amp;quot;Whose perseverance and dedication to the rule of law made this action possible.""

&gt; Fiji Director of Public Prosecutions Christopher Pryde said unresolved questions of money laundering and the ownership of the Amadea need to be decided in the U.S.&amp;quot;The decision acknowledges Fiji&amp;#039;s commitment to respecting international mutual assistance requests and Fiji&amp;#039;s international obligations,&amp;quot; Pryde said.

If you look at the vast majority of IRA bombings and shootings, they were mainly aimed at (what they considered) legitimate targets like security forces (RUC, BA, etc.), politicians (Brighton hotel), economic infrastructure (Canary wharf). 

IF you give the IRA the same approach as you would a conventional army fighting to free its land, you will surely see the situation from a very different perspective. 

That IF is obviously the main question - I.e. did/does the IRA have a legitimate goal or not. It all boils down to the ""terrorist or freedom fighter"" -question. 

I wrote my thesis on the subject and have sifted through the whole CAIN database, interviewed people on both sides etc. so I wouldn't consider myself ""uninformed"" exactly. Based on this research I will stick to what I said - The IRA mainly targeted what they considered legitimate targets. Also please note that I do not in any way condone clear targeting of civilians like in e.g. the Kingsmill massacre nor do I state that civilians never were targeted. I am, however, saying that the IRA for sure did not mainly attack civilian targets. If that would have been the case the casualty figures would be very different and it would also be really odd for the IRA to call in warnings to prevent civilian casualties if civilian casualties was their goal.",04355611d2d71a90e495f76360a2b8758b550421,True,False,,,,,0,1654682419,,0,{},iblaqdz,False,t3_v37twp,False,True,t1_iaycfre,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v37twp/the_irish_senate_has_recognized_russias_invasion/iblaqdz/,1654682436,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654653619.0,

I can believe that conditions for wounded Russians are worse than in western militaries (especially considering the scale of this war) but stories about them shooting their own wounded just sound like pure propaganda to me, I'm surprised anyone believes that.

I take the point about the numbers including allies and auxiliaries but I don't think it makes a huge difference. The DPR/LPR militaries are not that large, they supposedly fielded 40,000 men at the height of the Donbas war although that figure also included volunteer Russian regulars. Even if they had managed to muster 50-60k for this war and had suffered apocalyptic casualties (50% say), it would still leave the vast majority of these supposed 100,000 casualties to the Russian military and from what they are evidently capable of, I don't think that is plausible at all.

4176,[],False,,Norfolk_an_Chance,,,[],,,,text,t2_avsvh9r6,False,False,"Scholz’s leadership is marked by foot dragging at crucial moments in the Russian invasion. Day and night artillery barrages are flattening eastern Ukraine. Yet Germany supplies weapons only when under maximum pressure. It tries to sidestep the most effective energy sanctions against Moscow. Scholz continues to think that a solidarity visit to Kyiv would be a pointless publicity stunt. Accelerating Ukrainian membership of the European Union, or actively looking for alternative ways of blocking Moscow’s westward incursions, is regarded as too difficult.  
The core problem seems to be that Scholz, who at the outset of the Ukrainian war had announced with some fanfare the need for a sea change in German policy, is asking the wrong questions. At a Catholic conference this week he sat on a podium and asked the audience whether we should be fighting violence with violence. That was typically one of the talking points raised in German conscientious objection tribunals in the Cold War to test whether a candidate for military exemption was trying to swing the lead. It was a  
sophomoric question and not the issue of the hour. Which is: how does the West stop Putin’s attempts to tear up the European security order? What tools are available? How does the alliance act when a non-member is attacked?

  
Scholz ducks and weaves because he lacks the confidence to help shape Nato policy. Instead he is in a state of drift. Initially Ukraine was risibly offered 5,000 helmets by Germany. Then Scholz came up with his impressive-sounding sea change — Zeitenwende — speech, offering an extra €100 billion for Germany’s defence. It turned out the sum was actually a way of meeting its long-neglected Nato commitment to spend 2 per cent of its GDP on defence over the next five years. Other pledges followed and fell short. Germany promised to backfill Poland’s inventories after Warsaw sent tanks to Ukraine, but according to President Duda failed to deliver. Some armour may be coming after training of Ukrainian crews but only deeper into the summer. Light defensive weaponry has made its way into Ukrainian hands but the impression is that Scholz is worried Ukraine will escalate the conflict by firing into Russian territory. And he is worried, it seems, about the reputational damage of German panzers again going head to head with the Russians.  
All this goes to show that Scholz has not freed himself from the legacy of the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Like Schröder, whose father died as a private in the pioneer corps retreating from Russia, he has long agreed with the premise that Russian energy imports were a way of guaranteeing Putin’s good behaviour. Like Schröder he saw maintaining good relations with Moscow as a strategic imperative. Though they come from different generations, both were Young Socialists at a time when American sabre-rattling was seen as more destabilising than what Russia did in its backyard. This view was shared by many Germans but is now under challenge from conservative foreign policy thinkers like Norbert Röttgen who in an impressive new book takes both his former party leader Angela Merkel and Scholz to task. “We outsourced our energy to Russia, our growth market to China, our security to the US,” he writes. It was the German duty to reclaim its sense of agency. “If we don’t defend it, we will lose it.”  
Instead of trying to overcome German anxiety about being involved in (another) shooting war, the priority should be in getting Berlin to think more deeply about rebuilding post-war Ukraine. Better surely to lean on Scholz’s previous experience as finance minister than on his patchy grasp of the Donbas battlefield. And build on a positive consensus about the German post-war experience of the Marshall Plan in stabilising the economy, constructing modern state institutions and creating security. It won’t be easy. Estimates suggest at least $600 billion will be needed; there is no idea yet of how the war will end, whether Ukraine will be partitioned, whether Russia tries to manipulate a fake ceasefire.  
But Scholz will have a chance to exhibit some toughness in dealing with Putin. One open question will be whether the billions of dollars of oligarchical and Russian state assets frozen under sanctions can be confiscated and turned into a kind of reparations fund for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking to a Davos audience, made a powerful point: “If the aggressor loses everything, then it deprives him of his motivation to start \[another\] war. Values must matter when global markets are being destabilised.”  


This will be a legal nightmare, one demanding financial expertise and a great deal of stubbornness: let Germany work on the options now rather than live in naive expectation of it becoming a decisive arms supplier for Ukraine. We have discovered already that given the years of German under-investment in defence, counting on its weapons is like squeezing blood out of a stone. Instead of guns and guts, better by far that Berlin  
concentrates on being an enthusiastic part of a western masterplan to turn post-war Ukraine into a modern, resilient state rather than Putin's satellite",9547da9d054fcddc1d8743c447df98e66df5e8d2,True,False,,,,,0,1654679798,,0,{},ibl7sw1,False,t3_v764yk,False,True,t1_ibj1bjr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v764yk/according_to_a_representative_of_the_greek/ibl7sw1/,1654679816,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654650998.0,

“…The sentiment was laudable, but for some observers it was a potentially dangerous move. Before the signing, Nato had discreetly written to the German economics ministry to inquire about the security implications. Norbert Plesser, head of the gas department at the ministry, had assured Nato that there was no cause for alarm: Germany would never rely on Russia for even 10% of its gas supplies.

Half a century later, in 2020, Russia would supply more than half of Germany’s natural gas and about a third of all the oil that Germans burned to heat homes, power factories and fuel vehicles. Roughly half of Germany’s coal imports, which are essential to its steel manufacturing, came from Russia.

An arrangement that began as a peacetime opening to a former foe has turned into an instrument of aggression. Germany is now funding Russia’s war.

Also i think that the hope is, that this would enable the west bit by bit to send more and more sophisticated weapons into Ukraine, without a sudden escalation on the russian side. Similar to how the US decided to not send missiles that could reach Moscow, for now.

Sooner or later every country will send modern equipment into Ukraine. The problem is, that it does not seem to be a consensus among NATO, about how fast to move forward with modern weaponry.

Essentially each individual Ukrainian would choose.

Buy them or make them, I guess.

I've yet to spend 100 hours reading and testing. Molotov cocktails look easy enough, something that'd blow up a tank would likely be harder.

Assuming this is true, it's probably not quite as bad for Ukraine as this sounds at first. Tetyanivka is north of Sloviansk and the Russians are already on both sides of the river here. Capturing this a crossing here will support their advance on Sloviansk and shortens the supply lines of the forces making the thrust down the highway from Izyum.

However, Sloviansk is effectively between Tetyanivka and the Severodonetsk salient so a successful crossing here does not mean the imminent collapse of of the salient (a successful crossing further to the east might do).

It's still very bad news for Ukraine because it increases the threat to Sloviansk, which is the keystone of the Ukrainian defense of Donbas but on its own, its not going to lead to the encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk.",e98977d7344ccbf3ec7580d0d5738cda37ac4ab3,True,False,,,,,0,1654677854,,0,{},ibl5ne4,False,t3_v7jlep,False,True,t3_v7jlep,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7jlep/russian_sources_report_tetyanivka_came_under/ibl5ne4/,1654677867,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654649054.0,

The statement that Ukraine had captured 50% of SDonetsk was made in advance of Zelensky’s meeting and was likely an attempt by either regional (LHN governor was at least one party who made that statement) or federal to fluff the numbers to make themselves look good in advance of his visit. 

After he left, the LHN governor immediately changed his story the next day. This could not be found on reddit in this sub at the time, you could find hints of it, but generally there were well intentioned but wildly misinformed threads hitting thousands of upvotes reporting a Ukrainian advance that was not happening.

This gave Russians an opening on reddit to discredit this sub.

ISW was drinking from the same Ukrainian government cup. They have gotten better at including Russian telegram in their assessments (compared to early on in the war when they were straight Ukrainian government propaganda), but they regressed a little here. The burn on this should correct their behavior for awhile.

As for reddit, his does *not* mean redditors need to seek out Russian troll sources to obtain accurate information - as the Russians will typically jump in on threads like these.

This is objectively wrong. I agree Macedonia is given a particularly hard time because of bullshit reasons, first by GR, now by BG. And I think that the EU should step in there.

However, as can be seen in the yearly reports, Macedonia is hardly making any progress. The last progress was in 2019, when the chapter ""Judiciary &amp; Fundamental Rights"" was upgraded from ""some level of preparation"" to ""moderately prepared"".

*On the southern front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out four artillery and air strikes on enemy positions. Several pieces of military equipment and ammunition depots were destroyed and a number of personnel were killed. Enemy casualties are still being specified.*  
  
*Details: For their part, Russian Black Sea Fleet ships are trying to gain dominance in the Black Sea and establish control over its northwestern part.*  
  
*The Russian military is also carrying out activities to strengthen the defensive capacity of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island, Bratchuk added.*

About $53B has been allocated to Ukraine so far by the US. About 10% of that is only tangentially related but regardless this level of funding won't last forever. It's going to be hard to keep it politically feasible with the economy the way it is. I don't foresee any problems the next 18 months but I'm not sure beyond that. Especially since it's speculated that a war of attrition is Putin's long term goal to wear down Western support.

The EU has proven it is fantastic at thinking long term, caring about workers rights, keeping corporations in check but...

The difference between Britain's and the EU response to covid was stark. 

British civil service planned out how to get the vaccine and started investing to make it asap. Britain invested in multiple possible solutions. 

The EU spent 3 months telling its member states they had to work in a coordinated fashion and deciding rules, then it took time deciding which vaccine to fund. The process was fixated on value for money. Then the EU was surprised and upset when Britain was getting the vaccine first.

France and Germany are the largest economies in the EU and have the largest industrial bases. They could have used that might to speed up the process, they were passive instead.

We've seen the same behaviour with the next crisis .. Ukraine.

At the start of the war we had a German minister blow off a Ukrainian diplomat because the country won't exist in 24 hours. Germany was more concerned with the economic fallout.  It took days of war and Ukraine screaming for all ammunition and defensive weaponry people could give before Germany sent helmets. Valuable but needing to be paired with guns or anti tank missile's. Then we had weeks of announcements and quiet cancellations. I get why; Germany is going through an identity crisis, but its doing it during a crisis near its border.

France hasn't lead in humanitarian or military aid, it has delivered key aid as promised but its announcements are always after smaller western EU countries commit. Its leader has consistently given the message on ""giving Putin an off ramp"". The Baltic EU member states are going to interpret that as France would sell them out if Russia invades.

Now compare to Britain, which immediately committed large forces to the baltic states, increased military aid. Was the first to reopen its embassy, arranged a meeting to convince countries to start supplying troop carriers, etc.. when that failed committed to that alone. Started work on sea defenses for Ukraine immediately. First to commit to a defense treaty with Sweden/Finland. Then last week we saw Biden pressured to supply long range artillery and said no so Britain committed to it.

The comparative difference in leadership on this issue is insane. It really should be the inverse.

I wouldn't call France or Germany unreliable, merely unable to lead in times of crisis.",be04ec0a7c5911548fb9228ed2aa925c5c75fd02,True,False,,,,,0,1654673015,,0,{},ibl0ake,False,t3_v7gyku,False,True,t1_ibksggj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7gyku/ukraine_britain_poland_should_create_own_bloc_asap/ibl0ake/,1654673030,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654644215.0,

How Starlink works is that the Earth's surface is divided into hexagonal ""cells"" about 15 kilometers wide.  When a Starlink satellite passes over active cells (i.e. in territory where it has received government permission to operate), the satellite illuminates the 15-km-wide area with a radio beam from its phased-array.  Any active Starlink user terminals on the ground will detect the beam from the satellite and immediately start to track it with its own active phased-array and respond with its own electronically-formed-and-steered radio beam and establish the data connection with the satellite.

The satellite is low-earth-orbit (just 500km above earth), so it passes overhead from horizon to horizon in just a couple minutes.  So the Starlink user terminal downloads a schedule of future satellite passes from that first satellite it connects with, so it can automatically switch from tracking that first satellite going out of view to the next satellite coming into view almost instantaneously, so that your internet connection appears seamless.  This requires an active phased array flat-panel antenna which electronically forms the radio beam and electronically steers the beam without moving the antenna, and it is very fast.

Those active phased-array antenna flat panels are a grid array of over a thousand individual transmit and receive elements.  Very expensive to produce--  The first version cost SpaceX $3000 apiece to make, though they have driven the cost down to $1000 with the latest versions.

Active phased-arrays were originally developed for use as fighter jet radars like the [APG-77 AESA radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN%2FAPG-77) on the F-22 Raptor.  After a couple decades the technology has finally gotten inexpensive enough for SpaceX to use it to create a commercial LEO satellite broadband service (for which they have to develop an inexpensive orbital rocket to economically deploy the system, which is the Falcon 9 reusable rocket).",05887f5fc663e66304c62759fb97edf2a730153f,True,False,,,,,0,1654671353,,0,{},ibkycgs,False,t3_v7b5lh,False,True,t1_ibkr7zd,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7b5lh/assume_you_can_be_jammed_what_us_troops_are/ibkycgs/,1654671365,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654642553.0,

Analysis, prediction, cricitism and so on are NORMAL for this sub or at least they WERE normal back when I was here during the conflict 8 years ago. 

Maybe you didn't know what it was like back then, but let me actually enlighten you. 

Soldiers and commanders didn't know what was happening. We didn't know movement of troops, what gear was being used. We didn't know even if Russian regular forces were active or if it was just militia. This sub would sit and analyze tank variants like the T72-B3 and just point out it was a kind of version not present in Ukraine and only supplied by Russia, gradually exposing the truth about what was happening.

It's not a sub for Ukraine supporters or Russia supporters, it's just a sub for compiling data and analyzing it.

June 7, 2022

By Thomas L. Friedman

&amp;nbsp;

LONDON — Here’s a surprising fact: At a time when Americans can’t agree on virtually anything, there’s been a consistent majority in favor of giving generous economic and military aid to Ukraine in its fight against Vladimir Putin’s effort to wipe it off the map. It’s doubly surprising when you consider that most Americans couldn’t find Ukraine on a map just a few months ago, as it’s a country with which we’ve never had a special relationship.

Sustaining that support through this summer, though, will be doubly important as the Ukraine war settles into a kind of “sumo” phase — two giant wrestlers, each trying to throw the other out of the ring, but neither willing to quit or able to win.

While I expect some erosion as people grasp how much this war is driving up global energy and food prices, I’m still hopeful that a majority of Americans will hang in there until Ukraine can recover its sovereignty militarily or strike a decent peace deal with Putin. My near-term optimism doesn’t derive from reading polls, but reading history — in particular, Michael Mandelbaum’s new book, “The Four Ages of American Foreign Policy: Weak Power, Great Power, Superpower, Hyperpower.”

Mandelbaum, professor emeritus of U.S. foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (we co-wrote a book in 2011), argues that while U.S. attitudes toward Ukraine may seem utterly unexpected and novel, they are not. Looked at through the sweep of U.S. foreign policy — which his book compellingly chronicles through the lens of the four different power relationships America has had with the world — they’re actually quite familiar and foreseeable. Indeed, so much so that both Putin and China’s president, Xi Jinping, would both benefit from reading this book.

Throughout U.S. history, our nation has oscillated between two broad approaches to foreign policy, Mandelbaum explained in an interview, echoing a key theme in his book: “One emphasizes power, national interest and security and is associated with Theodore Roosevelt. The other stresses the promotion of American values and is identified with Woodrow Wilson.”

While these two world views were often in competition, that was not always the case. And when a foreign policy challenge came along that was in harmony with both our interests and our values, it hit the sweet spot and could command broad, deep and lasting public support.

“This happened in World War II and the Cold War,” Mandelbaum noted, “and it appears to be happening again with Ukraine.”

But the big, big question is: For how long? Nobody knows, because wars follow both predictable and unpredictable paths.

The predictable one regarding Ukraine is that as the costs rise there will be rising dissent — either in America or among our European allies — arguing that our interests and values have gotten out of balance in Ukraine. They will argue that we can neither economically afford to support Ukraine to the point of total victory — i.e., evicting Putin’s army from every inch of Ukraine — nor strategically afford to go for total victory, because faced with total defeat Putin could unleash a nuclear weapon.

One can already see signs of this in the statement by President Emmanuel Macron of France on Saturday that the Western alliance must “not humiliate Russia” — a statement that elicited howls of protest from Ukraine.

“Every war in American history has provoked dissent, including the Revolutionary War, when those who were opposed moved to Canada,” explained Mandelbaum. “What our three greatest commanders in chief — Washington, Lincoln and F.D.R. — all had in common as wartime presidents was their ability to keep the country committed to winning the war, despite the dissent.”

That will be President Biden’s challenge, too, especially when there is no consensus among the allies or with Ukraine on what “winning” there looks like: Is it the achievement of Kyiv’s currently stated goal of recovering every inch of its territory occupied by Russia? Is it enabling Ukraine, with the help of NATO, to deliver such a blow to the Russian Army that Putin is forced into a compromise deal that still leaves him holding some territory? And what if Putin decides he never wants any compromise — and instead wants Ukraine to endure a slow and painful death?

In two of the most important wars in our history, the Civil War and World War II, Mandelbaum said, “our goal was total victory over the enemy. The problem for Biden and our allies is that we cannot aim for total victory over Putin’s Russia, because that could trigger a nuclear war — yet something like total victory may be the only way to stop Putin from just bleeding Ukraine forever.”

Which brings us to the unpredictable: After more than 100 days of fighting, no one can tell you how this war ends. It was started in Putin’s head, and it will likely end only when Putin says he wants it to end. Putin probably feels that he’s calling all the shots and that time is on his side, because he can take more pain than Western democracies. But big wars are strange things. However they start, they can end in totally unpredicted ways.

Let me offer an example via one of Mandelbaum’s favorite quotes. It is from Winston Churchill’s biography of his great ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, published in the 1930s: “Great battles, won or lost, change the entire course of events, create new standards of values, new moods, new atmospheres, in armies and in nations, to which all must conform.”

Churchill’s point, Mandelbaum has argued, was that “wars can change the course of history and great battles often decide wars. The battle between Russia and Ukraine for control of the area in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas has the potential to be such a battle.”

In more ways than one. The 27 nations of the European Union, our key ally, are actually the world’s largest trading bloc. They have already moved decisively to slash trade with and investments in Russia. On May 31, the E.U. agreed to cut off 90 percent of Russia’s crude imports by the end of 2022. This will not only hurt Russia but also cause real pain for E.U. consumers and manufacturers, already paying astronomical prices for gasoline and natural gas.

All of this is happening, though, at a time when renewable energy, such as solar and wind, have become competitive in price with fossil fuels, and when the auto industry worldwide is significantly scaling up production of electric vehicles and new batteries.

In the short run, none of these can make up for the drop in Russian supplies. But if we have a year or two of astronomical gasoline and heating oil prices because of the Ukraine war, “you are going to see a massive shift in investment by mutual funds and industry into electric vehicles, grid enhancements, transmission lines and long-duration storage that could tip the whole market away from reliance on fossil fuels toward renewables,” said Tom Burke, director of E3G, Third Generation Environmentalism, the climate research group. “The Ukraine war is already forcing every country and company to dramatically advance their plans for decarbonization.”

Indeed, a report published last week by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and Ember, a global energy think tank based in Britain, found that 19 out of the 27 E.U. states “have significantly stepped up their ambition in terms of renewable energy deployment since 2019, while decreasing planned 2030 fossil fuel generation to shield themselves from geopolitical threats.”

A recent article in McKinsey Quarterly noted: “The 19th century’s naval wars accelerated a shift from wind- to coal-powered vessels. World War I brought about a shift from coal to oil. World War II introduced nuclear energy as a major power source. In each of these cases, wartime innovations flowed directly to the civilian economy and ushered in a new era. The war in Ukraine is different in that it is not prompting the energy innovation itself but making the need for it clearer. Still, the potential impact could be equally transformative.”

Go figure: If this war doesn’t inadvertently blow up the planet, it might inadvertently help sustain it. And, over time, shrink Putin’s primary source of money and power.

4947,[],False,,IneptProfessional,,,[],,,,text,t2_odhv0,False,True,"TSN.ua found out what the current procedure for serving summonses is and whether they have the right to serve them in martial law just on the streets, in shops or at bus stops and checkpoints.

As you know, general mobilization is the replenishment of the army with new servicemen. All citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 who are able to perform military service are subject to mobilization. The summons is made through the delivery of summonses. 

How to hand out summonses
The summons may be handed in person, at the place of residence or work.
Parents, wife and relatives can sign the summons.
The summons can be left at the door, thrown in the mailbox, in which case the summons will be unsigned.
Punishment for not arriving at the military registration and enlistment office under an unsigned summons can be both administrative (Article 210 of the Code of Administrative Offenses) and criminal (Article 335 of the Criminal Code). Whether a summons is thrown into a mailbox or shoved in the door, or whether criminal liability arises, depends on the availability of evidence or other challenges, such as whether there was a phone call from a military registration and enlistment office that was recorded on a dictaphone

Where summonses can be served today during the war
Nowhere in the law is it specified in which place the summons may be served. Therefore, it can be obtained anywhere - on the street, at work, at home, at checkpoints. In order to serve the summons, you must first identify the person to whom it is served. In wartime, you must always carry documents and provide them for inspection to an authorized person. An summons is issued on the basis of an identity document. 

Who has the right to serve the summons?
Yes, agendas can be served: 

military enlistment office staff;
employees of local executive bodies, local self-government bodies;
officials of the district (city) territorial center of staffing and social support;
employers; 
heads of educational institutions;
police officers.
Waves of mobilization
It should be noted that the information about the four waves of mobilization published earlier in the media is not true . This is not mentioned in the law ""On mobilization training and mobilization"", to which everyone referred. 

Moreover,  TSN.ua  in the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine confirmed that currently there are no waves in Ukraine, and there is a nationwide mobilization under martial law. And the confusion with the waves arose because, they say, they really were, but in 2014-2015, when the war began in eastern Ukraine. Currently, the mobilization is not divided into stages.

It could also be a tactic to ask for Iron Dome but they know they can't, so trying to get the Israelis to meet them half-way. Or 10% of the way. Something like 1.5mm Jews immigrated to Israel after the fall of the USSR. I don't know what percent are Russian, but it's extremely high and it may not be politically feasible internally even if this were actually a good idea. Of course there are many Ukrainian-Israelis as well, but they may be the Pro-Putin Russian speaking ones.

There is the moral issue of course, but Ukraine is \~30x the size of Israel and there would need to be a massive amount of batteries to protect it.  Kyiv Oblast alone is 3x the size of Israel....how much spare equipment can Israel possibly have? It'd just be posturing but it would also be very harmful for Israeli defense.

Israeli equipment isn't the same status as military equipment from NATO or from Soviet Republics. They are using it all the time...it's not sitting in some warehouse...and a hole in their missile defense could lead to dozens of their own dead civilians.  


Israel's security concerns, as a Middle Eastern nation, are completely different from that of NATO.  They need to be able to operate in Syria, which Russia allows them to do. Even if Belgorad and Kursk are captured by Ukraine, Russia will still exist and Israel will need to cooperate with them. Also Israel is under threat 24/7, having rockets and drones launched at them to attack civilians, and they are using Iron Dome regularly. They would  damage their national security and my understanding is the Mediterranean nations in NATO (Greece, Turkey) aren't providing much aid to Ukraine either.  


I hope you guys understand that Israel's permanent situation is very similar to Ukraine's current one and sympathize a bit. Ukrainian leadership recognizes this. Furthermore, several of Ukraine's top government officials (including Zelensky) have said that they want to model their post-war society on Israel. There isn't enmity between the two nations and if you put yourself in Israel's shoes it's very illogical to give lethal aid to Ukraine and piss off Russia.   


It's not the same as say, Poland, where Ukraine is basically acting as Poland's defenders from Russia. It's also not the same as the US or UK, who built gigantic stockpiles of weapons for the purpose of fighting Russia, and are now just transferring those arms to Ukraine to destroy Russia on their behalf.

My friend along with about 10 or so other foreign volunteers and a few Ukrainians had gotten intel on a group of Russians. They were able to to sneak up it was two BMPs and a Russian tank. The Russian soldiers at the time were just hanging around the vehicles, they had zero security, no one watching, etc. His unit took positions with Javelin/NLAWs they coordinate to strike the BMPs and tank at the exact same time and right as they hit their machine gunner (they had 2) along with the rest of the soldiers armed with AK47s would open up.

They fired at the tanks they blew them up, they opened up with small arms fire, 2 Russians, 3 more were seriously he was told a couple escaped. However the rest were dead.

The problem is, if you defend everywhere, you defend nowhere. It only takes one break to completely mess up your plans. Right now the best thing to do would be to fall back to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the Donbass, which are heavily defended urban centers that can hold for months. The Russians are almost definitely going to bypass the major river protection of Sloviansk by coming down the M-03 past Sviatohirsk, which they are claiming to already control. 

If you don't believe that, they have been reported as blowing up within the past day the bridges connecting to Lyman, which means they are very wary of a Russian attack from that direction. If they attack from both Lyman and Sviatohirsk (Svyatogorsk you can also call it), it will put a huge deal of pressure on not just the city, but the reinforcements going into the Lysychansk front and those troops trying to contain the breakout at Popasna. 

Yes, trenches and mobile artillery which can coordinate with drones can respond relatively well, but the Russians are massing artillery and attacking both along the entire frontline, which saps the morale of defenders and concentrating it in specific places to break certain sections and advance. At some point, someone is going to abandon their trenches and run away. Up to now, those isolated retreats have not translated into major Russian gains, but those are snowballing. 

If Sloviansk is threatened in any serious way, there aren't exactly a huge number of prepared reinforcements in a position to deal with that. The number of supply lines into the cauldron at Lysychansk are already extremely limited in number.

Due to the fact that the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation have extremely limited anti-aircraft means, the command of the Rashi fleet went to the installation of anti-aircraft missile systems on ships.

This is evidenced by a photo with a patrol ship of project 22160, which was taken in the bay of occupied Sevastopol and published by journalist Alexander Kovalenko, better known as zloy_odessit. On the helipad of the ship it is possible to see the ground SAM ""Thor"".

Installation on the ship of the project 22160 of this SAM is due to the fact that the regular means of air defense of this ship - ""Flexible"". This SAM is actually a small in size and capabilities complex with missiles from PZKR - ""Willow"" or ""Needle"", ie it can not shoot down targets flying above 3.5 km.

That is, if there is no air cover for this ship, it is possible to hit it even with Bayraktar TB2. And it is possible to forget about the possibilities of counteracting this ship with anti-ship missiles.

At the same time, the first known experiment in the Russian Black Sea Fleet with the installation of ground SAM on the ship took place in 2016, when ""Tor-M2KM"" was installed on the helipad of the frigate project 11356 ""Admiral Grigorovich"". But then it was rather perceived as a test of systems to create a marine version of SAM.

Especially since the frigates of the 11356 project have a more powerful anti-aircraft missile system ""Calm"", which is a marine version of the ""Beech"".

But for ships such as Project 22160, as well as small missile ships of Project 21631 ""Buyan-M"", such a ""collective farm"" is one of the few options to strengthen air defense.

But naval anti-aircraft missile systems differ from land resistance to aggressive marine environment, humidity and salinity, the ability to work during a swing.",a329c816672d1f1d4462d5dbff124a5cc44ff4a4,True,False,,,,,0,1654657799,,0,{},ibkekp2,True,t3_v7fefj,False,True,t3_v7fefj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7fefj/in_the_absence_of_protection_from_bayraktar_tb2/ibkekp2/,1654657812,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654628999.0,

As far as the US government goes, data is either classified and unclassified. Think of them as two different categories. The category of classified data contains multiple classifications within it requiring various levels of protection. Unclassified data contains various levels of data within it, most requiring some level of protection or restriction, while some is releasable to the public. For example, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is a type of unclassified data that is restricted from the public and must only be released to specific governments or individuals. It is not a classification because it is not within the category of classified data.

In the context of the US government, declassification means moving something from the category of classified data to unclassified data—NOT releasing it to the public.

However, it is possible to declassify something to a level of unclassified data that is releasable to the public.",243aa3e669eca6035b48ec949978c89f7e25c900,True,False,,,,,0,1654657370,,0,{},ibkdsw5,False,t3_v71m1t,False,True,t1_ibipncw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v71m1t/joe_biden_declassified_us_intelligence_regarding/ibkdsw5/,1654657384,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654628570.0,

5313,[],False,,Alter_Alias_Alien,,,[],,,,text,t2_2s8zk7pk,False,False,"Some of the intelligence that apparently convinced the US intelligence community and, ultimately, President Biden has already been publicly disclosed. On February 23, 2022, Biden himself said that the US had observed Russia moving blood supplies to the front of the Russians formations around Ukraine. *See* [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10541355/Putin-stockpiles-BLOOD-frontline-Russia-masses-troops-border-erects-field-hospital.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10541355/Putin-stockpiles-BLOOD-frontline-Russia-masses-troops-border-erects-field-hospital.html). *See also* one of the satellite images in the article at the prior hyperlink of a Russian military field hospital that had been established at Zyabrovka Air Base in Belarus, which according to Wikipedia is located essentially right on the Belarus-Ukrainian border. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pribytki_Air_Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pribytki_Air_Base). That satellite image was probably taken by a private business-owned satellite that supplies for-profit services, as opposed to a US military spy satellite, because the image itself is in a news article. If you’re a US intelligence officer, and you see trucks or aircraft unloading a bunch of materials at these field hospitals, and upon closer inspection those materials appear to be blood supplies, that would naturally be a huge red flag that Russia was actually planning to invade (why else would you need strategically deployed stockpiles of blood?). It was reported by Reuters as easily as January 28, 2022 that the US intelligence community has previously observed Russian moving blood supplies to these strategic points. [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-buildup-ukraine-border-includes-blood-wounded-us-officials-say-2022-01-28/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-buildup-ukraine-border-includes-blood-wounded-us-officials-say-2022-01-28/). If a private for-profit satellite that’s willing to take pictures of the Russian military for a news website could see the blood supplies being moved into position (the satellite appears perfectly capable of imaging the field hospital), it is a 99.9% certainty that a US military spy satellite could literally see the blood supplies moving into position. And, of course, the US intel community was right: the Russian military moved blood supplies into position because it was, in fact, about to invade Ukraine.

However, I think DIrector Haines was specifically referring to declassifying the intelligence the US had obtained that Russia was planning to stage a false flag attack against Russians, in order to create a pretext for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reports of that Russian-planned false flag attack seemed to intensify around February 12, 2022 (*See* https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/593973-us-intelligence-suggests-false-flag-operation-russia-could-use-to/), and by February 17, 2022 US Secretary of State Blinken specifically referenced the false flag in his address to the UN (*See* [https://youtu.be/PKpLd6dcXEI](https://youtu.be/PKpLd6dcXEI). As of February 18, 2022, the UK intel community seemed to concur that Russia was planning a false flag attack to create a pretext to invade Ukraine. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60434579](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60434579), so it’s not unreasonable to assume that - whatever intel was *specifically* declassified and shared - it likely included or concerned information about the Russian-planned false flag attack in Ukraine. 

I highly doubt that raw intelligence data evidencing the Russian-planned false flag attack on Ukraine would be publicly obtainable at this point in time under a FOIA request, because the raw artifact of intelligence could reveal how the intelligence was collected. We do know that on March 11, 2022, Ukraine claimed that a Russian jet fired a missile at a village in Belarus in an attempted false-flag attack (on Belarus) to create a pretext for Belarus to join the war as Russia’s ally, which in theory similarly could have been used to justify the Russian invasion in the first place. That’s my 2 cents only with publicly available info.",b7200ce9c522bf6dda779f94564a7792441b56ee,True,False,,,,,0,1654656429,,0,{},ibkc153,False,t3_v71m1t,False,True,t1_ibipncw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v71m1t/joe_biden_declassified_us_intelligence_regarding/ibkc153/,1654656441,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654627629.0,

Their ""advanced"" AA can't keep UA's similar soviet force on the ground, because they aren't that good tbh. We have video of fukn Bayraktars blowing up aa defenses. If it struggle against a Bayraktar, it will do nothing against NATO's SEAD capabilities. It's so useless it may as well not even be there.

And we have also videos of Ukrainian planes and drones being shit down. American airforce isn't invicible either either.

&gt;Their cutting edge submarine that occasionally blow themselves up? In fact Russia has been so utterly abysmal in every area they were ""feared"" for, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if NATO knows where every single ICBM sub is right now, and that half of them barely function.

Their ""Hypersonics""? Literally slightly modified air launched iskanders. Nothing like a working scramjet like this. They have a hypersonic missile in the ""we barely meet the requirements by cheating"" type of way. Not that hypersonics are particularly useful anyways but considering they have basically no working t14s or su57s, if they managed to build a prototype that DIDN'T blow itself up.. (2019), the chances of them having more than a single prototype or two is pretty much 0. The soviets? They were something to be feared. They were actually neck and neck with the west in a lot of ways. Russia? Lmfao. They are losing to tractors my dude. You don't even need the states. Uk, france, china... even turkey or italy or poland would push Russia's shit until next tuesday.

Kiznhal is still more advanced than anything America curently has. They also have things like Avangard, Poseidon, Buruvestnik, Sarmat, Zircon (true hypersonic scramjet cruise missile that can easily destroy American aircraft carriers). Hypesonics are useful when combined with nuclear warheads which Russia already can do.

Hitler was an avid white supremacist and German nationalist. Stalin was and avid Marxist, Mao was an avid Marxist, they really wanted to implement these crackpot utopian ideas in life no matter the cost, Bolsheviks were real zealots of this utopian murderous envy based religion.

 You are really a naïve guy who thinks of himself as a wise man because he formulated this simplistic equation in his head and you boil down everything going down in the world to this. Same dumbasses like you in Russia, with same mentality, were saying earlier: ""not PROFITABLE to take Crimea, Putin is not much more than a ""businessman"", think of all the sanctions and economical damage done to Russia and end of all the investment for decades! Those are just cronies, those are not fascists who would say than this nation has no rights to exist! Those are nothing but thieves, they would never invade Ukraine, what are you mental, lol?

  It doesn't matter that he is an admirer of Ivan Ilyin and Dugin's philosophy and he REALLY believes the shity forged history of Russian Empire and Soviet ""historians"" that there are no Ukrainians, Lenin ""made them up""  and Moscow has a claim on Kiyvan Rus, he spoke about it numerous times, wrote a 5000 word letter prior to the invasion too.

Keep being wrong, pal. I bet every Ukrainian character in Russian movies for the last 20 years was a clown, a fool or a traitor and the guy who was trying to start a Ukrainian school in Russia got murdered in front of his home because of rich resources Ukraine has. It's a nice bonus but not a prime motivator. They are destroying every Ukrainian book, name and nameplate in occupied cities and force Russian language and history in schools to kids (as they always did historically) only just because of the recourses, pal. They get a real joy from it, it makes their imperialistic dicks go hard. Just as torturing those who resist. Submission of the ""inferiors"". 

Also i bet Red army raped half of Europe in their ""liberation"" according even to memoirs  of red army veterans like Rabichev because you know, everybody does it, and rape and execution's of civilians, of kids just everybody does it all the time at equal scale and we cannot say that this is a pattern.

Their cutting edge submarine that occasionally blow themselves up? In fact Russia has been so utterly abysmal in every area they were ""feared"" for, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if NATO knows where every single ICBM sub is right now, and that half of them barely function.

Mearsheimer seems to have underestimated the shared sense if sympathy developed western countries have for those with similar ideals (the public pressure in response to Ukraine). This response would be greater if it was a NATO country as it would mean that no country is safe, prompting more radical public sentiment. The primary rebuttal that ""they aren't NATO"" would be a moot point.

Granted, for the sake of discussion, the US doesn't care about the safety of non-US citizens. The US would still care about its non-US markets, of which Europe is a significant part. Furthermore, the last thing the US wants is Russia in a more dominant position. If the US did not respond swiftly and overwhelmingly, it would bleed allies. The US keeps both dominance and security in regions of interest through sponsorship of said countries militaries, with the expectation that doing so lessens both the risk of war and American casualties if ever a war breaks out. Finally, the biggest factor would be that there would be no negotiation with a country that uses nukes. If a nuclear threat/attack is not rebuffed, what's to prevent it from being done again? It would definitely be great for the attacker.

Also, assuming the US decides not to retaliate with nukes, the UK and France would feel extremely uneasy given their proximity. Both countries have more than enough nukes, and a population directly and more intimately connected to the region. If the US does not, the UK or France would. More likely, all three would.

It could also be argued that, while Russia cares about its neighbors it wants to control, it does not care about the population in those areas as much more than a resource. This can already be seen in the disparity of conscription in the less wealthy regions of Russia, and cases for forced conscription within the Russian occupied Ukraine. Hence, Russian concerns would be saving face and keeping resources if Warsaw pact  countries close to it were attacked.",8f8d189c89c0d5384820705cc63b8cbe38e4396a,True,False,,,,,0,1654652340,,0,{},ibk3za2,False,t3_v5fvu3,False,True,t1_ibk0ck1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5fvu3/why_ukraine_war_is_not_the_wests_fault_realism/ibk3za2/,1654652355,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654623540.0,

The Russians switched to a strategy of attrition all the way back in late March, which became obvious by mid-April. They are not interested in capturing large swathes of Ukrainian territory any longer. They are heavily outnumbered and since they don't have the political will to announce a general mobilisation and double or triple their invasion force in Ukraine in order capture and hold significant amounts of territory, this is the only alternative. The strategy is pretty simple, and consists of exploiting the Russian firepower advantage in order to maximise the damage inflicted upon the Ukrainian Armed Forces in positional battles. The goal is to eventually batter the Ukrainian Armed Forces into a state of demoralisation through heavy losses with no end in sight to the war, which, combined with the Ukrainian economic collapse and what the Russians hope to be an inevitable collapse of civilian support for continuing the war, should force the Ukrainian government to surrender. Personally, I seriously doubt that this will work, even though the Ukrainians are suffering horrifying casualties(Zelensky last week admitted that the Ukrainians are suffering 700 casualties daily, and who knows what the real, non-under-counted number is). So I'm betting that the Russians will eventually realize after a couple more months that this isn't and Putin will be forced to declare a general mobilisation.

The Ukrainians don't care about territory either. If they did, they wouldn't be wasting all of their reserves on suicidal mini-offensives in Kherson, Kharkov, etc, that always crash and burn with massive Ukrainian casualties. Instead, their military doctrine is dictated by PR at every level. Every move they make is designed to create the impression that they are winning to keep spirits high, with the aim of ""waiting it out"" until the Russians decide to cut their losses and just pack their shit and go home because it's not worth it.

5620,[],False,,MuzzleO,,,[],,,,text,t2_u8y3x,False,False,"&gt; You seem to revel in arguing for the capabilities of Russian artillery, yet fail to recognize that artillery alone will not win this war. There is a reason why Russia has scaled back their invasion again and again to instead focus on extremely specific, singular goals where artillery is effective. If the goal is to take all of Ukraine, it's laughable that the world's second largest military has taken 3 months to occupy ~20% of a weak neighboring country, which still has not fallen.

It doesn't matter if it takes them even a few years if the end results is the conquest and annexation of Ukraine.

&gt;The creation of new arms and continued long-term support by first-world armies. The most you can do is argue that Russia has more artillery and the West's supply has not been significant, which are impressively weak arguments. If this is all you have to go on, then your confidence is laughably unwarranted for another two reasons.

They have tens of thousands of artillery pieces and USA has a few hundred, They also have more modern cruise and ballistic missiles than NATO combined too.

&gt;Political incentives for the West to continue supporting Ukraine. Not only does the West want to limit Russian sphere of influence, but Ukraine has done a phenomenal job of appealing to the West at every level from political leader to citizen and military leader to civilian. Ukraine is seen as part of the West and under attack from a dictatorship. Support for Ukraine will not stop until Russia has left the country. Even if by some miracle Ukraine is occupied in its entirety, the people will continue to receive support from the West.
The economic incentives for the West to continue supporting Ukraine. Russia currently holds the most resource-rich regions in Ukraine, which if Russia successfully holds, would somewhat restore and maybe bolster Russian economic strength for the next decade, or until renewable energy/nuclear power take over. By preventing Russia from occupying these regions or at least continuing to force Russia to contest these regions, the West has a straightforward method to prevent Russia from improving its primary source of economic power.

Merkel has also been criticised sharply for her reluctance to offer Ukraine a path towards membership of Nato at the crucial Bucharest summit of the western military alliance in 2008. Merkel said Ukraine at the time was a “deeply divided” country with a “shaky” democracy that was “ruled by oligarchs”.

She also said that she had not wanted to provoke Putin, saying that he would have seen Ukraine’s membership of Nato as a “declaration of war”. “[He] wouldn’t have just let it happen,” she said.

She also defended herself against the accusation that she had not reacted strongly enough to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

She cited the EU sanctions imposed on Moscow, which had been repeatedly rolled over; Russia’s exclusion from the G8 group of major industrial nations; Nato’s decision that each member state should spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence; and the sharp increase in the German defence budget from €32bn in 2014 to €50bn now.",de0d473a18fec216880062e1bd74533ddc991146,True,False,,,,,0,1654648009,,0,{},ibjvjpv,True,t3_v7c70o,False,True,t1_ibjvj8c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7c70o/combative_merkel_denies_appeasing_putin_over/ibjvjpv/,1654648022,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654619209.0,

Merkel said she had never believed in the “illusion” that Putin could be changed through trade. Her view was, she said, that if there could not be a close political relationship between Europe and Russia, “then at least it would make sense to have a trade relationship, because you can’t completely ignore each other”.

She also defended her insistence on always keeping open the channels of communication with Putin. “Russia is the second-largest nuclear power in the world,” she said. “I can’t pretend that it just doesn’t exist.”

“The interests of the country I governed meant finding a modus vivendi with Russia, in which we’re not at war but can try to somehow coexist, despite all our differences,” she said, to warm applause from the audience.

Many of the attacks of Merkel in recent days have focused on her diplomacy to end the conflict in the Donbas, the eastern border region of Ukraine where Russia-backed separatists staged an uprising in 2014.

Germany and France together brokered the so-called Minsk agreements that froze the conflict. But the separatists remained in control of the territory they occupied in 2014 and the hostilities did not stop.

Kyiv signed the Minsk 2 agreement in 2015 after Russian forces intervened in the conflict in support of the separatists, imposing heavy losses in the town of Debaltseve. Merkel said the agreement came about as “6,000 Ukrainian troops were at risk of being encircled in Debaltseve” and the deal had “introduced a measure of calm”. The shaky peace that it established also gave Ukraine “seven years to develop into what it is now”.

She added that she did not “know what would have happened if Putin had just kept going in 2014 and no one had bothered about that”.",4e4142b1efbe4c273ccd677c5b191e536841a485,True,False,,,,,0,1654648002,,0,{},ibjvj8c,True,t3_v7c70o,False,False,t1_ibjviqs,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7c70o/combative_merkel_denies_appeasing_putin_over/ibjvj8c/,1654648015,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654619202.0,

**Germany’s interests meant finding ‘modus vivendi’ with Russia, says ex-chancellor in first interview since leaving office**

Angela Merkel said she had “nothing to apologise for” over her policy towards Moscow, and Germany’s former chancellor denied that she had “appeased” Vladimir Putin over the years in her efforts to ease tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

Merkel was giving her first interview since stepping down as chancellor in December last year. It was also the first time she has been quizzed publicly over her policies towards Putin, which have come under mounting scrutiny since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24.

“Diplomacy isn’t wrong just because it doesn’t succeed,” she said. “So I don’t see why I should say that was wrong, and I won’t apologise for it.”

She said of the war: “Looking back, I’m glad that I can’t accuse myself of trying too little to prevent such an event from happening.”

Merkel was long seen as one of Germany’s greatest postwar leaders. But her reputation has taken a battering since the outbreak of Russia’s war, with many, both in Kyiv and Berlin, accusing her of cosying up to Putin and prioritising economic ties with Moscow over support for Ukraine.

Her interview in front of a packed audience in the Berliner Ensemble theatre with Alexander Osang, a reporter with news magazine Der Spiegel, showed that she has been stung by the criticism.

The normally cool Merkel, who admitted to being “depressed” by the war in Ukraine, was combative and emotional, keen to justify herself and rebut what she clearly felt were unfair accusations about her conduct in office.

Much of the criticism has focused on her policy of “Wandel durch Handel” — or “Change through Trade” — which was based on the idea that deepening economic ties between Russia and the west would encourage political change in Moscow and a shift to liberalism and western values.",0527017bb094ebb2b61ac5fe371b0746e25d6d13,True,False,,,,,0,1654647995,,0,{},ibjviqs,True,t3_v7c70o,False,True,t3_v7c70o,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v7c70o/combative_merkel_denies_appeasing_putin_over/ibjviqs/,1654648007,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654619195.0,
