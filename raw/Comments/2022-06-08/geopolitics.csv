I have given a handful of solutions to this already and given you companies that are working to take advantage of the new energy economy. As usual, more modern and agile companies will thrive by taking advantage of the new situation

 &gt;&gt;Now they slow down or even mothball otherwise producing units? Then opposite when people stop buying their home solar because itâ€™s pricing sucks, it will lead to a shortage

You mean through market pricing actions as demand for solar increases or decreases? I can put the opposite forward. It will just get cheaper again when there is solar needing to be built 

&gt;&gt;there are good reasons we donâ€™t want every Tom Dick and Harry producing power into the grid.

This Is a really wild comment considering your entire argument boils down to, people shouldn't get their own power because it destabalises corporate profits....

And even though some countries may do thst due to lobbying etc doesn't mean it is what is good. 

Despite that not being necessarily the aim of a country, the nature of big corporations will change. Companies thst produce Large power stations in my scenario will be replaced by ones that build hydro electric dams. And ones that build electric cars. 

Its also bizarre because you seem to be unable to consider any economy other than as it functions right now. Almost a, the horse and cart is better than the car. 

Eg, 

&gt;&gt;Now they slow down or even mothball otherwise producing units? 

This already happens in many countries 

solar is so cheap, it would be very easy for a nation to simply over build solar (as I said elsewhere solar can be thrown up in literally months, again its the agile companies jumping in and quickly increasing supply either at the demand of market or government) 

In fact solar could get so cheap if you build a hybrid power station of gas and solar it is feasible it would be more profitable to just shut off your gas power on sunny days because the cost of the fuel alone is higher than the solar",8b5cfed7b6028f8dbac5a9440a4d4d3ef5d60d48,True,False,,,,,0,1654666230,,0,{},ibkrph4,False,t3_v6xh36,False,True,t1_ibkayxi,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6xh36/the_new_energy_order_how_governments_will/ibkrph4/,1654666242,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654637430.0

It would destroy any remaining moral legitimacy remaining with the West, and would almost certainly be opposed by the majority of Western populations. Almost all allies would run for cover. Remember that Western populations questioned the intelligence used to go into Iraq for the previous war there, and that resulted in large-scale protests. Moral legitimacy is the geopolitical currency of democracies as opposed to arbitrary use of hard power, which has its place but as a final resort. 
2. Lack of precedence. The basis for many geopolitical actions is looking back to similar situations previously, then being able to see what actions worked and then what the likely consequences of those actions would be. Once a strike is performed, there is no way to predict the reactions of the rest of the world. It would very much be a Pandora's Box moment.
3. What I call ""law of the sandpit"" would say that using nukes in a pre-emptive strike opens you up to other countries and allies responding to you in kind (what I imagine Russia is currently considering). It would be a good way of making yourself a target for a return nuclear strike. 
4. Utterly disproportionate action. Nukes have been used once, at the end of a world war against a thoroughly beaten opponent who indulged in a five year spree of war crimes and who pledged to fight to the death of every last man, woman, and child in their country rather than surrender. Without the use of nukes, it's likely there would have been a land invasion costing millions of lives, and Emperor Hirohito would never have got out from under his generals to end the war. And despite all that, people STILL believe that the use of nuclear weapons was a step too far in this instance. 
5. The US has currently got themselves OUT of the Middle East at great expense, and that was even with the Iran situation unchanged. Disengagement seems baked in and bipartisan right now for the US. Why on earth would they return in such a dramatic fashion?
6. Looking at the leaders in the US supporting gun rights post elementary school massacres and the overturning of Roe vs Wade, I'd suggest there's a lack of compassion there too. Wouldn't consider nuking them though! But jokes aside, you need solid existential reasons to use a nuclear weapon. Keep in mind that under current geostrategic doctrine, they are kept as a deterrence and not to be actually used.

Another consideration is the Ukraine's rapidly deteriorating economic situation. The Ukrainian economy is slowly heading to nothing. Economies are fragile, complex machines. If the machine loses one of those components i.e oil then the machine fails. 

Russia has an embargo on Ukrainian ports &amp; is targeting Ukrainian rail infrastructure. Further the war effort is requiring a  lot Ukraine's most productive people (young men) to fight. In  essence Russia's ""special operation"" has plunged Ukraine's economy is in dire straights and only get worst. 

What this means is order to survive as a state. Ukraine will require foreign aid and lots of it. Que lend lease of 33 billion from the USA and other support from the European states. Lend lease will only last 5 months though. What happens after 5 months? Ultimately this isn't a long term solution and will eventually become a domestic political issue. The West can't really pull this support as it will cause Ukraine to fail. However they can't or won't really be interested in supporting the Ukrainian state indefinitely.... so they face a predicament. The only way to resolve this predicament is to soundly defeat Russia militarily or to come to terms.   

Russia knows this and what it means is Russia can attempt to leverage this as a way to remove sanctions. Russia and the West will find them selves in a prisioners dilemma of sorts over Ukraine....

Of course it is, within constrains of realism. All the West prefers to do business with countries that don't do those things. And once the world carbonizes more Saudis can go back to driving camels. 

&gt;If the regime is friendly, they get a pass. 

it gets a lighter treatment and a occasional pass. But this does not really matter, nothing that happened in Bahrain changes the situation in Ukraine and the evaluation of decisions of Russia and it's puppet.  It's just whataboutism. 

&gt;Yats of course became PM after the coup. 

Wait are You surprised that the leader of the second largest party in the Rada (and first after Yanukovich's disintegrated) became the PM? The guy with the most democratic mandate for it. And Your proof is that it was good for the US because he is a moderate and won't do anything crazy? Next thing You know Boris Johnson is a CIA plant because he became PM and allies with the US. 

&gt; Russia was paying $3B a year in transit fees to Ukraine. Ukraine's entire GDP is $150B. When Ukraine had good relations with Russia, Russia also provided them with $billions in subsidies via cheap natural gas.

The transit fees are not a handout. 

After 2010 with a friendly goverment that leased Sevastopol for the deal they payed at at discount but by 2013 they already payed as much as Germany and almost as much as Poland.

&gt;According to Yanukovych, he fled in fear for his life from a violent mob. 

And his only solution was to run to Russia? He might have stayed in the Donbas or Kharkiv where he had support and was safe from any mob. But after his parties government has fallen he would not safe from prosecution. That's why he fled.  

&gt;Like NED's Weinstein (...) for a ""thinktank"" funded by weapons manufacturers and oil companies.

I fail to see relevance of all that. Beside NED is a foreign agent of influence of the US. They have it on their webpage. They are doing it openly. 

&gt; UAF have been bombarding Donetsk

That video starts with an MRLS that maybe will be in Ukraine in the summer and a text to speech voice over videos a night city with some burning and nothing to identify it or the time period. You have something that does not look like it didn't even bother to not look fake.

&gt; It didn't have to be a deal-breaker.

Like I said look at Brexit. Accepting the regulatory regime of the EU by Ukraine would basically either force Russia to accept it at least in practice like Chinas manufacturers do or make their goods illegal in Ukraine regardless of their status at the border. Ukraine could have had a Free Trade deal with the EU but they didn't want that, the majority of the whole country wanted eventual EU accession not just Western Ukraine.

So something that was not in the plans before the war? Might as well mention the biolabs and secret nuclear weapons.
