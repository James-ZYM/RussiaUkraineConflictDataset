I mean, Putin's Navy is getting it's arse handed to them by a country that doesn't even have a Navy...that speaks volumes right there. 

I mean Zelensky went to the front lines recently on the Eastern front, Putin has to have a 12 foot long table to meet with folks.

America never thought it would be 5 days, maybe for Kiev? We stated from the get go this would be a long drawn out battle. 

Sanctions have failed huh? Then why is your state run media constantly whining about it? End the Sanctions! IF Putins army is doing so well as you state then why even argue about it? (reverse psychology here, or RU logic) 

Your own state run tv was whining about how the US is able to get supplies and they can't. 

RU soldiers are injuring themselves, turning tail and refusing to fight. There are phone calls intercepted, Radio transmissions, hell even videos call capturing this information. 

I'm not saying there isn't propaganda on both sides, we KNOW this. BUT, uttering nonsense that is completely contradictory to the facts is another level of it.

Behaviours of a Narcissist


Entitlement: Regardless of whether he/she has earned respect or honor, a narcissist believes that he/she should have it. Narcissists often look down on others and view themselves as superior.

Preoccupation with fantasies about power, brilliance, beauty, ideal love, or unlimited success: These fantasies are more than a teenage daydream.  A person with narcissism often has delusions that he or she possesses some great quality that others cannot obtain or even begin to understand. They may fantasize about a famous person being secretly in love with them. When someone calls the narcissist’s attention to the fact that these feelings are a fantasy only, they become very offended and play the victim.

Bruh the nazi movement was formed originally from fascist german army units known as the freikorp. You have absolutely no idea what constitutes a fascist and its embarrassing to see people like you act like you do. 

Russia is run by reactionaries, has significant fascist elements in their structures of government, including a significant presence in their paramilitary. If given a long enough time and a big enough crisis, I have no doubt Russia would descent into a fully fascist state. The Ukranian conflict isn't justified and should end immediately and crimes are being undoubtedly committed all across Ukrainian soil bu russian forces.

NATO doesn't bow to Russia. The fact that Russia may invade a sovereign nation in response to a NATO promise has no right to stop NATO from making that decision. It's hardly a provocation for war to tell a country ""sure, in a decade maybe."" 

There is only one valid casus belli: in response to an invasion.

It was Russia's choice alone to invade Ukraine. Nobody put a gun to their head. There is precedent for nations to join NATO without receiving NATO troops on their grounds, like west germany.


Russia had already attacked Ukraine in the form of Crimea and Donbas. Ukraine had every good reason to join NATO.


Russia had options that weren't war. 


NATO was created in 1949 after Joseph Stalin blockaded east german berlin. After the Soviet Union occupied poland and then denied it it's re-independence. After it held onto every nation that it ""liberated"".

This has always been NATO's purpose: to stop aggression against US partners by promising to defend them.
