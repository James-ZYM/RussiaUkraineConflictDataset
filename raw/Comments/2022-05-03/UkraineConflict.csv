Let's break this down for a moment: 

- Galizien were part of the SS, which would go on to commit genocide against Jews (Holocaust.)
- Galizien fought against the Soviets, which had already committed genocide against Ukrainians (Holodomor.)

Both things are true, but people do not commemorate the former. They commemorate the latter. 

As a parallel: No one celebrates the 1943 Bengal genocide, perpetrated by Winston Churchill. But many celebrate Churchill's victories against Hitler. 

Or for a parallel closer to home, consider that no one celebrates the Holodomor, a genocide perpetrated by Josef Stalin.

Ukraine can fight indefinitely so long as the west is going to supply them with (relatively) cheap MANPADs, ATGMs, and most importantly--drones.  Even if there is a stalemate in the east, that is a decisive tactical win for the Ukrainians because they will be able to perpetually bleed the Russians using drones and sanctions until the Russians are no longer able to hold territory.  Conservative estimates are that the Russians have 10,000 KIA and likely double that in wounded.  That's ***30,000*** troops out of the fight in the ***TWO MONTHS*** that Russia had the tactical advantage.  Ukraine is now getting more and more and more weapons to take the fight to the Russians.

So NATO has, contrary to your assertion, launched offensive rather than defensive operations, such as the one against Serbia which utterly proves you wrong, but, you don't consider you've been proven wrong because NATO didn't *have* to do it in the first place, they just *chose* to. Therefore, NATO coulfd literally invade every nation on the earth as an act of aggression and you would *still* claim they were a ""defensive organisation"" on the basis of your previous post.

Read it again numbnuts - the action taken is one that is deemed necessary including the use of military force but THAT DOESN'T OBLIGE THEM TO TAKE ANY MILITARY FORCE ONLY TO CONSIDER IT.

Hence siding a shipment of pillows doesn't violate Article 5. And this is why you are trying to conflate Article 51 of the UN Charter (which you also don't understand/are lying about).
