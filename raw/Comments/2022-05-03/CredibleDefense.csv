Ok, this needs to be contrasted with, for example, US bomber production in WWII. An airframe was produced by passing it through stations on an assembly line where semi-skillef and unskilled workers do a very small task at a specific step of the production, then passing the airframe to the next. This is still true with civilian truck or car production.

It's not the same with military manufacturing, with the exception of small arms or autocannon ammunition. From military humvees to fighters and even some PGMs, the product is assembled by hand, at one or a few stations, where a small number of skilled workers work on it and they need to.be able to get over, under, and around it.

The problem is that military orders are *very* small compared to what may potentially be used. A dozen planes and tanks, a few hundreds missiles per year. 

Parts and spares, because they need to be produced in quantities to be handed to the end users for maintenance, they can be produced and stockpiled in quantities. On the other hand, nobody really has a plan to figure out how to mass produce in true Detroit-style assembly line for war production of a war that involves a hundred divisions, for example. We know that ammunition consumption rate doubled between 1945 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, and doubled against between 1973 and 2014 Donbass. 

And even when something is truly mass-produced, rolling through conveyor belts and with tons of automated machineries, just because your consumption rate increases drastically, you will still run into shortage. Like with COVID and masks. The world produced around 20 millions surgical masks per day, perhaps a bit fewer N95s, and three quarters of those in China. True automated mass production. COVID came, consumption rate skyrocketed, and shortage ensues. The price of an N95 went up 10 times. Even 2 years later, it is now *only* 5 times (though the currency did lose may be 7-14% its value). Ammunition stockpile may be a bit deeper but contemporary wars are as ""come as you are"" as possible.",962249658a0533fc1a115ae9e00c1baf0a1f30fb,True,False,,,,,0,1651617886,,0,{},i77xg66,False,t3_ugrjje,False,True,t1_i75uvmb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugrjje/flexibility_in_the_us_defense_industrial_base_and/i77xg66/,1651617897,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651589086.0

I'll give you an example. You would have seen the loud pronouncements of how terrible the Russian military's performance is given how many of their senior commanders have been killed. 

The fact, however, is very different. The high rates at which senior-ranked Russian commanders are being killed is because they are actually leading their troops into battle.

This article is not just relying on the PLA's publications, doctrines, concepts. It is misreading and misapplying them to the given context. As such, it exhibits a dangerous superficiality in its understanding of the concepts it highlights and in some places it's just wrong.

&gt;The actual PLA AAR of the Ukraine conflict will probably read the exact same way as their postop of all the Arab-Israeli wars - yet another scathing critique of Soviet-Russian doctrine that is so offensive and denigrating it would damage the Sino-Russian relationship if it were made public.

Indeed! This is so true and nor really appreciated by many. The PLA strategists are hardcore realists and they likely don't mince their words in private.

The previous leaders of the nation neglected the country's military to such a degree that feeding and maintaining its small number of people was almost the entire budget. And any assistance was eagerly accepted without question or stating of needs. The internal security apparatus however had money lavished on it so that the leaders of the time could use it to intimidate its internal opponents. 

The expelling of the Russian diplomats was another thing that got me, as I thought it was going to be evidence of some kind of strategic policy or intelligence success against Moscow. Yet it turned out to be signalling to Russia that it did not appreciate the money laundering charges that it put on the leadership. So either Russia tried to clean up the corruption in Moldova, Moldova was too corrupt by Russian assessments, or Russia had the temerity to accuse another nation's leaders of being corrupt. Quite the options there.

Dr. Dumitru Minzarari is a Research Associate with the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (German Institute for International and Security Affairs, SWP), covering Russia’s domestic, foreign and security policies. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and his MA in International Affairs from Columbia University in New York. Previously, he worked as the Secretary of State (for defense policy and international cooperation) with the Moldovan Ministry of Defense, held expert positions in OSCE field missions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and worked with a number of think tanks in Eastern Europe.

-------------

&gt; * Moldova has been discounting and underfunding its defense and security sectors for the past three decades, despite having over 10 percent of its territory under Russian control.

&gt; * The historical legacy includes the deficient skills of statecraft among the Moldovan elites following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, psychological reticence toward employing the military as a tool after the army’s defeat in Transnistria in 1992, the civilian leadership’s fear of military involvement in politics, as well as chronic economic scarcity. 

&gt; * perhaps for the first time since the country’s post-Soviet independence—and this government’s full control over all branches of power, the overall (in)ability of the authorities to safeguard the state has not changed.

&gt; * The incumbent authorities continue to show a strategic timidity toward Russia, a disregard for Moldova’s defense and security apparatus, and a lack of understanding of the various tools of statecraft at their disposal. 

&gt; * Defense and security policies have always been an elite endeavor in the Republic of Moldova. The general population does not consider these issues salient enough to confront the authorities over them in case of disagreement. Partially, this is due to widespread belief, shared by both the majority of voters and mainstream politicians, that defense and security issues, in their current state, have little impact on the country’s economic outcomes and welfare.

&gt; * In many respects, the sequence of events leading up to and during the Transnistrian conflict mechanics closely mirror the process that prepared and triggered the Russian proxy war in Ukraine’s Donbas more than 20 years later.[2]

&gt; * The defense budget underwent its most significant drop during this time—from 0.609 percent of GDP in 2008 to 0.263 percent in 2010. Since then, Moldova’s defense budget grew insignificantly (see Figure 1), reaching 0.375 percent of GDP in 2020.[14]

&gt; * The period between 2009 and 2015 can be described as one of increasing “oligarchization,” in which defense and security sectors were treated according to their perceived economic value. That situation worsened during 2015–2019, when Vlad Plahotniuc de facto ruled Moldova, treating it like his personal fiefdom. The authorities during this time largely considered the defense and security sectors of insignificant importance, due to their limited ability to produce rents or be monetized. The only exception were the Ministry of Interior and, to a lesser extent, the Intelligence and Security Service, which largely acquired the functions of internal police, helping Plahotniuc to coerce his opposition, civil society, business competitors and vociferous citizens.

&gt; * And while there is nothing unusual about expelling diplomats over espionage charges, it is surprising that Moldova had never done this before with regard to Russia, even though it repeatedly had the necessary evidence. In fact, authorization for this bold action was most likely not informed primarily by national security concerns but rather seemed to be designed to send a warning signal from Vlad Plahotniuc to the Russian authorities, which had initiated a series of criminal investigations, including on money laundering charges, against him.[17]

&gt; * With PAS’s overwhelming victory in the parliamentary elections in July 2021, the situation around Moldova’s defense and security sectors changed compared to Dodon’s period of rule. At a minimum, the new government halted the incipient trend of inhibiting effective cooperation with the West in military and security areas on the one hand, while strengthening such ties with Russia on the other hand. 

&gt; * Russia has been particularly keen and active in weaponizing corruption, using it as “a tool of statecraft to interfere with, co-opt, weaken, and destabilize democratic institutions and processes”[30] in the post-Soviet area. 

&gt; * However, the Russian vision of pragmatic relations with Moldova are built on a zero-sum logic: for Russia, pragmatism in this context is when “Moldovan authorities can decide for themselves, without any steering from outside.”[33] In other words, Russia understands that without the support of its Western partners, Moldova would be unable to balance Russian pressure and influence, and would instead end up bandwagoning with Russia,[34] becoming a de facto satellite state.


&gt; * As part of its conventional war against Ukraine, Russia has been trying to acquire control of the Ukrainian coastal region around Odesa via a joint amphibious and land attack, which would physically connect Russian forces in occupied Crimea with Moldova’s Transnistrian region. Such an outcome, if successful, would be a likely trigger to subsequently threaten Moldova with a military invasion. The alternative for Moldova would be accepting the demands of an ultimatum, similar to the one Ukraine received from Russia, involving federalization and an effective mechanism giving the Kremlin total political control over Chisinau.

&gt; * As part of the Russian potential ultimatum, the likeliest change in the status quo in the Transnistrian conflict would be for Russian forces to expel the Moldovan authorities from the small pockets of territory it controls on the left bank of the Nistru, as well as from the town of Bender. This would bring some tactical and operational advantages to the Russian military were it to decide to strengthen its position and want to put additional pressure on the Moldovan government, particularly since the stakes in negotiations suddenly increased following February.

&gt; * Moreover, there was always a political force in the legislature that has been receptive to Russian demands.

&gt; * Neutrality today remains the sacred cow of Moldova’s security policy, and it is included in all national security and defense doctrinal documents.

&gt; * Over the years, Moldovan authorities have been criticized by Western diplomats for being unable to come up with a national vision about how to resolve the Transnistrian conflict. This has been a fair accusation for some time, but it is not completely justifiable any longer. President Sandu and other dignitaries have pointed out that Moldova’s policy toward the conflict is grounded in the goal of withdrawing the Russian military and ammunitions from the region, changing the militarized “peacekeeping” mission into a civilian one, and creating economic incentives to attract the support of Moldovan citizens living in Transnistria.

&gt; * By viewing the military tool of the state as ineffective, and under economic pressure, Moldovan officials have largely ignored the National Army. With one of the smallest defense budgets in Europe, Moldovan military forces have degraded in training, equipment and quantitative indicators. For instance, some recent available data indicates that Moldova recruited 1,250 conscript soldiers during the recruiting season of April–June 2021. It intended to recruit another 1,050 conscript soldiers during the recruiting season of October 2021–January 2022.[52] These numbers have been consistent over the last few years[53] but overall, it is possible to see a generally decreasing trend.[54]

&gt; * The Russian war against Ukraine indicated that a large part of the assistance Moldova received from NATO—via programs such as “Building Integrity” or “Women, Peace and Security”—are good only for peace time and are poor substitutes for much-needed combat training or modern equipment. 

&gt; * Given its proximity to NATO borders, and shared language and culture with EU and NATO member Romania, Moldova would likely become a highly effective operational hub for Russia’s further strategic actions against the Euro-Atlantic alliance’s southeastern front.",45ba9625ce2e4b9156d2f905e50db39bb6cd7694,True,False,,,,,0,1651614877,,0,{},i77qlgt,True,t3_uhr03w,False,True,t3_uhr03w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uhr03w/neutrality_with_no_guarantees_the_evolution_of/i77qlgt/,1651614890,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651586077.0

Already a month behind schedule, Bradley's First Army launched a three corps abreast drive south to clear the Hedgerows to the St Lo road. Able to defend in depth from some of the most defendable terrain in the world, German units made it a nightmare, but US troops made steady progress grinding away, albeit at horrific casualties. But the Germans also took horrific casualties too, that they were unable to replace because they didn't have a working replacement system. And so were forced to commit their tactical and operational reserves up to the field army level. So the next offensive First Army launched, Op Cobra, achieved a breakout that couldn't be stopped initially, not even when the theater reserve attempted a counterattack (Op Luttrich), which made things worse.

[],False,,FirstDictonary,,,[],,,,text,t2_3si6s2gw,False,False,"It is probably no surprise to anyone that Lviv is a transport hub for Ukrainian logistics. This can be gleaned from the other targets: Vinnytsia and the Kirovohrad Oblast, all on the M-30 highway. So the Russians are at least attempting to strike at Ukrainian logistics, delaying the arrival of Western supplies at the frontlines. 

The presence of “ammo dumps” in Lviv may indicate a couple things. Probably, the ammo dumps serve as the transition between the supply lines heading across the Ukrainian border and the supply lines heading towards the frontlines. As for why trains don’t just head from Poland passing Lviv and towards other cities? Simple, different track gauge. Although the Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa does exist, the Ukrainians use the 1520 mm Russian gauge while the rest of Europe exempting the Baltic States use 1435 mm gauge. As a result, train would have to get their bogies changed and with the amount of traffic from refugees, humanitarian aid and of course military aid, that downtime train piles up fast. So at the moment, it’s basically get the supplies over the border, then to a logistics hub which then ships it to wherever it is needed. And that’s the other thing—there are multiple fronts. Kherson, Kharkiv, and practically the entire Donbas region. And if you were wondering about air transport, that is also a no. Neither Russia nor Ukraine can claim air superiority. Although the cargo isn’t fully unpacked, some of it will be divided up to be sent either to the northeast through Kyiv, southeast towards Odesa, Mykolaiv, or perhaps to the east through Dnipro.  


However, Ukraine and NATO do have other options, namely Kovel (Polish border) Chernivtsi (Romanian border) and Uzhgorod (Slovakian border) assuming the inflow of military supplies mirrors that of humanitarian aid. So supplies are likely spread out among these cities and towns with their own separate supply routes. And of course, NATO has the benefit of being able to use airlift and railways to get equipment around Europe. 

In short, the ammo dumps in Lviv probably aren’t stockpiles but rather equipment that is waiting to be sent to the frontlines. In other words, a glorified rest stop.",9750760378702704e66272efd3711ba385e8ef05,True,False,,,,,0,1651614458,,0,{},i77plt4,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i7716yl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i77plt4/,1651614477,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651585658.0

Either of those could lead to land grabs on a feasible timescale.

Right now we're yet to see that - every point on the front is either a weeks-long grindfest or a slow crawl forward by Russia matched by an orderly crawl backward by Ukraine.  And my point was the area gained that way is not happening quickly enough to work - they need to actually succeed in doing some of the things you said.

&gt;The real question I have is what the Ukraine general staff are thinking. How badly do they want to hold the Severodonetsk Salient and Luhansk oblast? Is the focus to hold ground at all cost or are they willing to lose it assuming they can destroy enough Russian formations to make a future UAF counteroffensive more likely to succeed? Are they thinking short game or long?

My knowledge of their board state is limited, and that sounds like a decision with risks either way.  A lot of their current line positions are some of the most fortified areas on the planet so there's a strong incentive (in both the long and short term) to making the Russians pay deeply and have to destroy some fortifications.  On the other hand, Ukraine's most experienced troops are the ones who would bear the brunt of any last stand, which is also very bad.

I think at least until Popasna fully falls (probably while away) or something similar, they're going to stand and fight for their hardpoints, like Severodonetsk.  Repeatedly in this conflict so far, when having to choose between standing and fighting in their heavy fortifications and cutting bait, Ukrainians have chosen to stand basically every time, and most of the time it seemed to have worked out for them.

They're likely to stick with the devil they know until they have no other option.

However, it's possible at the tactical level assuming the Russians can do a few things. One, they need to cut the Ukrainian supply lines or seriously interdict them to prevent large scale reinforcement. Two, they have to force the local Ukraine tactical and operational reserves to be committed. Three, they have to either attrit the existing UAF to the point they have to try to retreat or else outmaneuver them in a way they have to retreat lest they be cut off. 

The drive to Barvinkove seems to point that they're doing step one. Step three is ongoing, that's what the heavy arty/airstrikes is doing, with ground assaults acting as probing elements to find enemy positions that fires try to destroy or dislodge. If that works well enough and more key areas like Lyman fall, the UAF have to commit their reserve to either reinforce key positions or else counterattack to retake that which was already lost.

Yeah the crude way of putting it is that ships may have become tissue paper.  I personally think that's as oversimplified as the ""tanks are dead!"" crowd, but missile and other standoff weapons are a big thing our navy needs to worry about.

On a minor note, the war has confirmed that um... the javelin and NLAW are really freaking good, and infantry divisions equipped with them have a substantial anti-armor capacity in a near-peer conflict. 
 As a disclaimer however, we as a military want to kill the tanks before the infantry have to worry about it anyway.

Regarding soviet anti-air capacity - it's traditionally argued that S300s and S400s are superior to US peer systems, and while that might still be true, I think the war has poured cold water on their on-paper capabilities.

These tanks are undergoing regular movement and maintenance, and effort is being made to protect them from the elements. I have seen an image from inside a similar facility (can't find it) that showed the tanks being pumped full of dry air.

Lenin thought that nationalism would spur on the revolution and eventually disappear, so he actively crafted the wider ukrainian territory and actively gave them a *national* identity.

Even if they balloon that number *absurdly* with local conscripts (and all the morale and training problems THAT would create) they still have no hard supply route to Russia, which means they'd be entirely dependent on locally stockpiled equipment.

That equipment, thanks to its location, would be even *more* disused and dilapidated than the stuff we've seen Russia deploy thus far. *Everything* will be 30+ years old, even the toilet paper, and *nothing* can be restocked, because again, *Transnistria has no land, water or even air routes to Russia from which they can be supplied* - Moldova is surrounded by either a) Ukraine itself (whose territory russia cant send supploes through without being shot), or b) NATO member nations (whose territory Russia can't send supplies through without risking WWIII).

Most importantly, the Russian commanders should *know* this by now. So *what is the plan?* any serious attempt to invade Ukraine from Transnistria is utterly doomed and both sides know it.

The only thing I can think of is some kind of bizarre double bluff - the Russians are trying to bluff the Ukrainians into thinking they're actually crazy enough to try it, so the Ukrainians will station forces along the Moldova border to forestall an invasion attempt that never comes, thus drawing them away from sectors where they're actually needed.",0ee7a08740a47ec770f72f340261a50f4986fb4a,True,False,,,,,0,1651607276,,0,{},i7787r7,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i776hz5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i7787r7/,1651607292,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651578476.0

&gt;	The Russian experience shows that precision missile strikes are unlikely to decisively affect the course of a war. They have limited value in taking and holding territory and are insufficient to secure a military victory. Missile strikes cannot transform the battlefield and create a politically favorable outcome.

I’d question this, especially the last part. Missiles have failed to produce a politically favourable outcome in Ukraine because as an existential conflict, the Ukrainian populace is willing to endure extreme hardship in the form of destruction of their economy and infrastructure and still keep fighting, because the alternative is worse. It is estimated that Ukrainian GDP will fall by something like 50% this year. Obviously not all of this was inflicted by missiles, but we’ve seen significant portions of their prized defence industry (+other key industrial targets like grain processing plants) that was specifically targeted by PGM and will be incredibly difficult to recover. 

Iranian enemies may have a much, *much* lower tolerance for targeting of key infrastructure, especially the Gulf economies who generally have a lot of extremely high concentration of crucial assets and population that are all within range of Iranian PGM (as we have seen with Houthi strikes), unlike Ukraine which is geographically large and whose population is relatively dispersed, not to mention how due to lack of diversification of their economies, the damage done by the destruction of individual sites may be much greater. 

Do you think UAE or Saudi would be willing to take a 50% hit to GDP and irreparable damage to their oil and gas infrastructure rather than come to the negotiating table? What if it’s a scenario that does not directly concern them (i.e. Iran’s political goal is to stop them from supporting anti-Iranian policies of another power for example the US or Israel)? For the Ukrainians, negotiating and giving up the fight means annihilation of their national identity at the least. For other Iranian enemies for whom confrontation is not existential, fighting might represent taking an enormous economic hit for little actual gain. I think this is something the Iranians would be counting on.",6773d4763e064c903788af3995fe7190d81dfd07,True,False,,,,,0,1651604508,,0,{},i771l9k,False,t3_uhfij7,False,True,t1_i75lrdk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uhfij7/iran_is_learning_from_russias_use_of_missiles_in/i771l9k/,1651604524,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651575708.0

*Irish Defence Forces not fit for purpose, say Finnish officials. Ireland needs to triple military spending to stand chance of defending itself, says general* 

https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/irish-defence-forces-not-fit-for-purpose-say-finnish-officials-1.4867585

&gt; * “The report was quite revolutionary in Irish terms but, given the situation today [with Russia], we would have been even more ambitious,” said Lieut Gen Pulkkinen. “Your defence forces are seriously underfunded; I said in webinars that you would have to triple spending. The Irish people –and your defence forces – deserve that.”

&gt; * A continuation of “business as usual”, the report warned, would leave Ireland “without a credible military capability to protect ... its people and its resources for any sustained period”. Translation: Ireland cannot defend itself today, let alone tomorrow.

&gt; * As one senior official puts it: “Please explain to me why Ireland is celebrating a centenary of its independence from the UK, yet, to defend that sovereignty, relies almost entirely on the UK?”

&gt; * Retired Finnish general Pekka Toveri suggests the best route for Ireland to defend its interests – as an open, exporting economy of services and multinationals – is by being a proactive EU member and driving on EU common security and defence structures.

&gt; * “The key question for Ireland is this: will membership of the EU provide enough security for you in decades to come?” he asks. “If the answer is yes, you don’t have to change anything. If you think there is any chance that you will need a stronger and more robust military capability support for your sovereignty, go for Nato.”",9724159184fca9274d1b1a52f4162bf53d96bb27,True,False,,,,,0,1651603142,,0,{},i76yfkq,True,t3_ugqaiu,False,True,t3_ugqaiu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugqaiu/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i76yfkq/,1651603160,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651574342.0

I don't think its possible in general to have air superiority over the South China Sea in the outbreak of a war. China is going to immediately level the US bases in the Philippines, they would simply not start a war with the ability to do so. 

That leaves the US with two real options:

1. Carrier based air wings
2. Long range missions with ariel refueling.   

The first one is going to be in severe danger due to hypersonic antiship missiles and the second is going to be limited logistically. China has the home field advantage in the South China sea, just like Chinese air superiority over the US mainland is unlikely.

This would allow him to stem the bleeding away of the 200,000 contraki he has, add 100,000k conscripts to them that have completed at least very basic training in their first 6m, add about 80k reserves and another 100k conscripts to that number in about a further 6-9m time.

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

&gt; Chemical and biologicals can break through a conventional stalemate for example. 

This has never happened, despite people trying.

Germany was the most enthusiastic chemical weapons user in WW1. Chemical weapons did not break the stalemate. Germany eventually did break the stalemate - with tactical innovations, not chemicals. 

Iraq tried to break the stalemate with chemicals in the Iran-Iraq War. It didn't work; they had *very* limited and temporary success, until...

&gt; Defenders can put up barriers to protect them from conventional arms, but gas and biologicals will get through. 

...the Iranians issued gas masks to their troops. Chemical weapons are cheap and trivial to protect against in the field; much cheaper and easier to protect against than conventional munitions. To my knowledge, nobody has yet developed a ""bomb mask"" or ""artillery mask"".

&gt; Also its not about killing as much as it is as getting people sick so they can't fight. In Iran-Iraq, gas killed nearly 5000 Iranians and sickened more than 100,000.

1. Conventional weapons killed between 195,000 and 595,000 Iranians and wounded hundreds of thousands more. They were, without question, much more effective at killing Iranians than chemicals.

2. That ""100,000 sickened"" figure is *very* sketchy, because it includes everything from ""had some temporary respiratory distress"" to ""spent the next 20 years bedridden in the hospital"". There were almost certainly way more of the former than the latter. In their statistics, the Iranians of course emphasized the effects of chemical weapons for propaganda purposes. 

&gt; In Syria, it helped stop urban combat because it can just be dropped from a helicopter into defended and fortified buildings.

Chemicals *didn't* stop urban combat in Syria, though. There are very few reports of significant government gains immediately following chemical weapons usage. There are *tons* of reports of chemical weapons usage in rebel-held areas, followed by... the areas staying rebel-held for months or years, and being retaken by the government on roughly the same schedule as similar rebel positions that did not suffer major chemical attacks.

I don't know where you get your ""history"" from. But if you have any doubt about why the Israelis did so well in conflicts where they seemed to be facing completely overwhelming odds, you need to watch [documentaries like this one on the six day war.](https://youtu.be/hHqJ6pgdE-c) 

You will see from that documentary that the Israelis had been expecting to be attacked for a long time and had been preparing for that, studying various aspects that contributed to performance. 

For instance, one of the reasons they were able to take out the larger Egyptian airforce while it was on the ground was due to smart tactics, but also due to the work they had done in speeding up the turn around of planes when they returned to base after a raid, increasing the effective power of their smaller airforce.

Also, factors such as working out the amount of water troops needed to be effective in the heat. The Israelis worked out it needed to be much higher than had been previously thought. When the Egyptians were retreating across the Sinai desert, a lot of them died due to dehydration.

And a lot of the Israeli equipment, such as tanks, were quite old. But the Israelis customised them to work more effectively in the sandy conditions of the desert.

*""In comparison to who? By that standard, would you say that France or the U.K. are some of the world's ""foremost military powers""?""*

For instance, they have just developed a [high energy beam air defence system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1L7Hs3pnbs) that seems to be science fiction becoming fact.

You may not like the Israelis due to the situation in Palestine, or in Syria. But don't doubt what an incredible force they are.

To be classified among the world's ""foremost military powers"", I'd say that you need at least to be powerful across all three major domains - air, ground and sea.

France and the U.K. have decent navies and modern, if not exactly large, air forces. Where they come up short is with ground forces: even with the mobilization of reservists, France maxes out at 141,800 ground personnel and the U.K. at 146,250, marines included. They can sustain in the field at most half-a-dozen maneuver brigades each, and would be swamped by the larger, if less advanced and proficient, armies of many less developed countries.

They also have limited munitions stocks, even for their air forces, as highlighted by the [2011 Libyan campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD_story.html). They also have small manufacturing bases, worth respectively $324 billion PPP and 10% of GDP (France) and $298 billion PPP and 9% of GDP (U.K.).

Thus, in a conflict with, say, Iran, neither France nor the U.K. would be threatened by the latter, but neither of them could also hope to mount an invasion of Iran.

Yes, factories can be repurposed, but this is with the caveat that designs have to change: ersatz goods substitute for actual, and quality decreases. In major wars between industrial powers, high production value equipment that’s excellent for limited wars ends up in short supply in favor of inferior substitutes. One of the most efficient places where quality is cut is in durability, as most equipment in peer wars is not expected to survive longer than a month anyways.

The greater problem for the US is that the heavy industrial base as a whole is not that large. In 1941, the US produced more steel than the rest of the world combined. Today, China does that, and the gap is not small. The US most years isn’t even the 2nd largest producer, it’s the 4th - behind India and Japan. The gap between the US and China is usually more than 1100%. This - not dedicated military supply chain problems - is the key weakness of the US in a peer war, as otherwise it has good demographic and military fundamentals. You’re right that you can refrigerator factories, the problem is there aren’t that many refrigerator factories left after deindustrialization and outsourcing.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"They'll need more than just infantry conscripts to win this war.

To start with, they'll need to expand the army by about 3-4x at least. 

As it is, their borders are mostly bare because most combat units are in Ukraine, and that needs to get remedied with more units. 

They still don't have enough units in Ukraine, they need to increase the number of those that are available to ensure they have a manpower advantage everywhere. 

Within Ukraine they need reserves so they can rotate units in and out, because no unit can stay on the line indefinitely unless they use a personnel individual replacement system, which Russia has never used. To do that right they need two units for every one fighting, with one unit just leaving the line to start it's rebuilding process and one coming to the conclusion of training while getting ready to relieve the unit on the line; they can get away with a 1:1 but anything less and it means some broken units don't get relieved and stay on the line indefinitely when they shouldn't be. 

To do this requires not only activating the reservists (most of whom weren't ground combat arms trained) but also means a new law for mass conscription. They'll need junior enlisted for every MOS in every branch of the military (VKS has to grow too, might as well expand the navy if they're going to mobilize). They also need officers too, they can't rely on a volunteer system for them so the elite of Russia society with college degrees and education will need to be drafted too. We're talking many millions.

All of these will need to be trained at places that don't exist, by trainers who aren't available, for jobs nobody decided on yet, to be issued uniforms that probably don't exist, to use equipment that either isn't ready or doesn't exist, to be paid with funds that aren't available. And all of them will have to be conscripted indefinitely, with no 12-24 months limitations or the whole thing collapses when the first big date comes around. ""Duration of the War plus One year' type commitment. Does this sound like it'll be popular?

Of all existing BTGs uncommitted to the Ukraine war, they'll need to be sent to Ukraine immediately to start rotating the existing ones out. The veteran ones will either be rebuilt with the first wave of reservists or else broken up to be used as cadre to create new units of reservists, or to be used as cadre to train and eventually create new units who the first wave of conscripts. 

If they decide to forgo removing units and just reinforce Ukraine with remaining BTGs from other BTGs, nothing happens the entire time in the rear. They can't call up reservists to create new BTGs without cadre, and they'd all be fighting. They can't expand training for new conscripted recruits because the trainers are all fighting. They can't create new units for the trained recruits when the cadre for those will be fighting. The veterans have to be rotated out in sufficient number to make those happen, but then manning in Ukraine plummets right at the time when the weather is perfect for offensives.

If they decide to take the personnel from those existing BTGs to create an individual replacement system augmented by reservists, that buys them 3-6 months until those need to be relieved. That'll be the best manning decision they can make in the short term but it still won't be enough to replace everyone whose been fighting since the war began, and that's a problem. 

Russia is fucked whatever they do. Their best hope is a replacement system they've never used before that itself has some pretty significant problems (all of them do). They don't have enough spare BTGs to replace all BTGs in Ukraine so they can't rotate forces out from Ukraine without weakening themselves greatly during the height of good campaign season. Waiting till the fall wet season starts is too long and those units and veterans will be exhausted by then.  And it's near impossible to create new units without cadre from veteran units stuck fighting (not even considering all the other issues mentioned above).

&gt;Israel only exists today because it managed to fight off the much larger (and better equipped) armies of its neighbors

That's bad history. In 1948 Israel had the manpower advantage, and in both 1967 and 1973 was at least as well equipped as its neighbors.

Beyond that, Arab militaries suffered from a host of defects, many characteristic of underdeveloped countries. In 1970, for instance, the Arab world still had a [73% illiteracy rate](http://article.scieducationalresearch.com/pdf/EDUCATION-3-7-1.pdf).

&gt;Today Israeli defense industries are at the forefront of missile defense, electronic warfare, autonomous weapon systems, surveillance systems, armored vehicles, and firearms.

In comparison to who? By that standard, would you say that France or the U.K. are some of the world's ""foremost military powers""?

&gt;The Israeli Air Force regularly dunks on its neighbors in Syria and **Lebanon** who operate ""advanced"" Russian anti-aircraft systems like the S-300

Lebanon isn't exactly a tough nut to crack. Syria's military isn't quite world-class either.

Various countries could penetrate their airspace. But then penetrating Syrian airspace isn't the metric by which one acquires the status of one of the world's ""foremost military powers"".

Russian conscripts only serve 12 months in total from first to last day in uniform and that's been the case since 2009. That's why they rarely use them for either technical positions or combat arms (within ground forces: infantry, tank, recon, engineers). Contract troops are used for everything else, they make up the majority of enlisted ranks (60%), serving a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 year contracts/enlistments with the ability to continuously get promoted into an actual NCO corps and warrant officer ranks. 

Russian conscripts typical receive 2-3 months of training, contract troops receive more (upwards to years long for very complicated jobs). 

When it comes to creating basic rifleman, about three months is all that's needed to create one but they're going to still require unit training to learn tactics and to build cohesion with their comrades. 

To make mobilization work not only would they have to conscript beyond infantry junior enlisted (they'd need to induct upper class educated Russians to become junior officers) but they'd have make their terms of service indefinite, for the duration of the war. That gives them the option to discharge individuals if they choose but no requirements that they have to.

Aside from trying to look good on the international stage. We assume that in this situation they would be under sanctions. Ukraine happens to be both a great food producer and has a largest repository of natural gas in its Western side of the country (Something Russia would most certainly develop.)   


In addition people are less likely to rebel against your government if its at least (Trying) to help. so rebuilding the country is worth it just to ensure your occupation dosent need to go on indefinitely. In addition a rebuilt nation can handle its own security better versus one without even basic essentials.  


Outside of those reasons. while Putin dosent respect Ukrainians anymore he still see's the (Land) as Russian and would probably try to push more Russians to migrate and live there. If all they have to inhabit is a wasteland it dosent look good for him. Also Putin tends to be very patriotic (Or at least likes to look that way) so he would see it as his duty to restore the former Russian land to its prominence. which prior to this war he saw Ukraine as part of the USSR and that regaining and restoring it would be a big ideological goal for him.

Most, but not all, reconissance satellites are in high polar orbits.  They orbit the earth at an inclination of 45' or higher.

So in 90 minutes they pass over a spot, and 90 minutes later they pass over a spot about 200-300km further westward.  

Generally, they'll get a view of the same spots about once a day, maybe a bit more often.

Well, if you just brush aside reality then I cannot speak to that at all. I am only interested in discussing what are probable outcomes. If you start from a standpoint that is extremely improbable for various reasons, then you cannot simply dismiss those reasons if you are seriously considering the outcome should that improbable thing occur. It is improbable exactly because Putin and the elites know there would be extreme issues.

The reasons Russia does not mass mobilize include domestic pushback. Saying Russia can simply requisition 100,000 trucks in a country that does 90% of its shipment by rail and then acting like that would have no catastrophic effect on domestic support for the war is absurd. At the very least it would drastically effect the economy, because those trucks don't exist for fun, and the people who have their trucks taken are immediately going to want to know why. Previously, if you aren't a soldier, there isn't a direct effect on you. If your truck, something extremely valuable to anyone who owns one, is taken, you are going to not be apathetic.

The real main things holding back mass mobilization is that Putin's regime has flourished on apathy. It has not been the propaganda of its predecessors, full of fervent nationalism, it has been the dispiriting cynical kind that posits everyone is to blame and no one is good. That may keep people from protesting, but it doesn't make for zealous hordes ready to die in waves. That is why a quick victory was critical. Mass mobilization entails handing a gun to a large group of people, people who you hope as a dictator wont turn it back on youl",96ad81a6c4f810308aba61f3870b0b294593339c,True,False,,,,,0,1651589939,,0,{},i761369,False,t3_uevbwj,False,True,t1_i74dkop,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uevbwj/the_history_of_russian_conflict_behavior_tells_us/i761369/,1651589954,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651561139.0

Honestly its hard to say. I definitely think some kind of major decision even should it be to just ""Stay the course"" will be made on the date. But war...? It depends on the Russian public and how willing they are to go that far... which also answers your third question.  


&gt;What would a flood of conscripts do to the conflict? Is that the next step, or are there more active reserve forces that could be deployed?

This is a far easier question to answer since we have more concrete data on it and its less hypothetical in nature. Personally my answer is: ""Russia will use conscripts to replace its existing border forces and try to shift those border forces into Ukraine."" thing is. This isn't a viable solution short term or potentially even long term.  


Ultimately Russia's problems in this war are not related to manpower but rather logistics, competency, lack of strategic focus, poor weather, etc... almost all existential problems that cant be fixed by adding more bodies to the pile. And that is what direct deployment of conscripts or existing border forces would do. Add more bodies to the pile.  


I mean its not like they are adding elite troops to the region or anything like that its just more of the same. So why would the performance of their army suddenly change? Using conscripts would be even worse as they are even less competent than their existing forces.  


In addition to all of this conscripts cant be just given a rifle and sent to die like 1812. War is complicated now and even they need sufficient training to operate their combat kits and other equipment they will be issued or need to interact with. So these conscripts (If Russia wants them even slightly effective) Will need at minimum likely 6-8 months of training. So the idea that they will come in the short term is ridiculous. By then Russia will be in an even worse state assuming nothing changes from the present situation.

&amp;#x200B;

So Russia is in a very hard place. Even if it somehow ""Wins"" in Ukraine it inherits a totally decimated country that they will need to slowly rebuild while under massive sanctions. Every possible outcome for them seems to be a lose lose situation. and they have no-one to blame but themselves for it. Yet there government is still looking for a quick easy fix.

Personally I side with this take when I hear explanations about this. Conscripts if I had to guess will probably be used to replace existing defense garrisons Russia has on its borders allowing them to shift those more experienced troops to Ukraine.  


The problem Russia has is that shifting these garrisons to Ukraine wont help much other than pour more bodies onto the pile. The vast majority of problems they have aren't manpower related (Sure more men always helps) but the issues lie more in logistics, morale, Strategic focus, and general competency. Adding more of the same wont fix their issues.  


Aside from all of that as you mentioned even conscripts cant be just given a rifle and told ""Go fight!"" like the olden days of the Russian empire. War is complicated now, and even a conscript needs a sufficient amount of training to operate the various equipment they are issued as part of a modern combat kit.

 Ultimately it will just prolong what I think is inevitable. They get ground down, and forced out of Ukraine even if Ukraine falls to pieces in the process.

As far as visually documented vs reported numbers, there is a lot of factors why they would skew one-way vs the other. First, it's a voluntary thing, literally just snapping pictures and sharing them on social media, which affects who and why they would share those pictures. First is a volunteer (territorial defense) vs a professional soldier, logic dictates that someone who was a plumber 2 weeks ago would be much more eager to share how his unit destroyed the Russian column, while the soldier would be more focused and thinking about opsec. The same goes for excited farmers showing themselves towing a tank. Another is what type of vehicle, if it's a tank the soldiers would be much more excited to share it, instead of some soviet era shitty truck. Another is terrain, if you are in or around forests with a low threat of artillery you have much more time to take pictures, while in open field areas where engagements can happen miles away and threat of artillery is everpresent you leave the moment you can. Another thing is what weapons do they use, Ukrainian MoD said that NLAWs are Ukrainian soldiers anti-tank weapons of choice, yet if you look at /r/CombatFootage it's Stugna-P all day. Well Stugna has a display that soldiers can conveniently film and missile has to be guided the entire time, while NLAW allows you lock on the target, shoot and immediately back away. NLAW is a superior weapon but Stugna-P will grab all the headlines because it's much easier to visually document the kills. 

And reality corroborates it. We had the most pictures coming out of Kyiv region which was mainly defended by territorial forces, while footage out of JFO has been sparce since the beginning despite the heavy combat. So little footage out of Izyum despite the battles there being described as ""apocalyptic"" (for both sides).

[],False,,RichPumpkin725,,,[],,,,text,t2_aosqq6g0,False,False,"&gt;Does anyone have any interesting theories on why their tank losses seem much higher compared to their armored vehicles losses (at least according to Oryx), and why Ukrainian claimed numbers of total Armored Vehicles seem to be lower than expected assuming expected BTG size and composition?

Personally I ascribe their tank ""losses"" to a lot of different factors. Everything from bad logistics to the weather. I also think we need to be more critical in our language A ""Loss"" can mean a lot of things: Mission killed..., Actually destroyed...., Surface damage but crew abandoned.... etc... All of these are a possibility and sometimes a tank that appears to have been ""Destroyed"" was actually hit but then abandoned by the crew.  


That being said their tank losses are higher than their other armored vehicles as you mentioned and if I had to take a guess as to why its because of target priority. On a battlefield a soldier with an AT weapon is going to have limited ammo and thus when he see's a column of armored vehicles pick the targets he hits carefully. Sure the front and rear vehicles are no brainers to start. (Stops the column and creates a killbox) but afterwards what takes priority? The biggest threat.   


In an AFV convoy that will probably be the heaviest armored vehicle... which happens to be a T72, T80, or T90. The BMP's and BTR60-80's are certainly not pushovers but unlike tanks they aren't armored with 200mm of armor or ERA. Assuming you have a 30mm cannon or even lighter on your own supporting AFV's you could probably penetrate the BTR's just like that. Thus killing one with a javelin or other ATGM is kind of a waste when you could prioritize the afore mentioned tanks which require these heavier AT assets to destroy them.  


Another factor is the morale gain of killing a tank versus a APC or IFV. In the end tanks even in the modern world have a almost Knight like admiration to them. They are the juggernaut able to shake off everything short of a proper weapon designed to kill them. As such killing one earns you as an infantryman a lot of respect amongst your peers. We witnessed this effect in Afghanistan with insurgents there often targeting the heavier vehicles with IED's or AT weapons since to them killing a M1 Abrams is far cooler and more respect earning than blowing up a Humvee.  


In the end I think we need to wait till the war is over and more NGO's can have a look at the losses and draw better conclusions. Then we can really get a picture of what happened to the Russian army and the reasons behind its problems.",49798e815aacb56b09d0bc8cda706762453a29d3,True,False,,,,,0,1651585773,,0,{},i75r0id,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i75mkef,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i75r0id/,1651585788,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651556973.0

In general, whilst I think Oryx is a good baseline and have added +33% to this, I'd admit it's quite possible for overall Russian tank losses to be even higher. 

As to your last point, about their stunted advance, it could be contributed to because of a lack of tanks, but I'd counter that Russia hadn't made much progress out of the Donbas (with the exception of what they were able to capture in the first 2 weeks) because they ran in to the elite of the Ukrainian military and the most prepared defensive positions.

Going by that **120BTG** number (could be more, I believe Russia surged some new BTGs in) - it should contain 120 \* 40 = 4800 Armored Vehicles (APC, AFVs, IFVS, excluding MRAPs and Tigr like vehicles as Im not sure). Oryx only documents 326 AFV + 655 IFV + 105 APC = 1086 as of 3rd May. Lets give it a 75% account rate, which works to 1448 vehicles. That's supposedly 30% of their invading force. That makes it half of the tank losses in percentage terms.

Note that Ukraine claims that 2567 of them are destroyed for a 88.85% loss rate [according to this site](https://minusrus.com/en) (Wow! but take it with a pinch of salt). The site claimed total deployed numbers of the  Russian force makes the 'correct' claim for total tanks (120 \* 10 = 1200), but is much lower for 'armored vehicles' (2900 vs 4800 expected), for some reason.

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"I am not sure about the author's claim that this is the first time tactical ballistic missiles have played a major role in battle. In the Iran-Iraq war for example there were a lot of ballistic missiles being fired back and forth at each other's capital. And the V-2 rockets in WWII were pretty shocking to the world at the time. But perhaps this is not a battle field use according to the author. 

Iran's deterrence is largely based on its ability to hit back at its immediate neighbors and hold them under threat of attack by missile strikes. The missiles in their stockpiles are similar to that of Russia, so the use of these missiles is a big deal for Iran and they must be watching the war closely. 

It does seem that the proliferation of missile tech is leading to another revolution in military affairs, where missiles are getting cheaper and more accurate and the price of these precise and deadly missiles is going down. The victory of the Ukrainian anti ship missiles, the Ukrainian anti armor missiles, and the Russian cruise/ballistic missiles over conventional airpower are all developments that will accelerate this trend. 

---------------

&gt; * …Russia had launched more than 1,950 missiles — far more than the 955 cruise missile strikes U.S. forces carried out during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

&gt; * Aside from scale, the use of missiles in the Russian operation is also different from previous 21st-century wars in terms of the combination of systems employed. Russia’s missile strategy has involved the use of ballistic strikes (the Iskander and Tuchka-M), cruise launches (Kalibr), hypersonic strikes (Kinzhal), and coastal defense systems attacking ground targets (the Bastion and Bal systems). In comparison, U.S. forces in Iraq relied only on cruise strikes, using the Tomahawk BGM-109 and AGM-86 CALCAM.

&gt; * In fact, it’s the first time since World War II that tactical ballistic missiles have played a major role in battle.

&gt; * With its military doctrine heavily dependent on ballistic missile forces, Iran has a particular interest in the war in Ukraine and is taking notes on Russia’s use of missiles.

&gt; * Ukraine’s limited long-range strike capability and inability to inflict costs behind frontlines into Russian territory have prevented the meaningful extension of the war into mainland Russia. The absence of such a threat influenced Russia’s calculus in starting the war and hampered the Ukrainian army’s ability to deter Russian aggression. This is how the Iranian military views the war in Ukraine.

&gt; * This logic is clearly laid out in an internal bulletin from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which states that, “Missiles, by building the balance of fear, can prevent war and will force adversaries to resort to diplomacy.”

&gt; * …Iran’s Deputy Chief of General Staff for the Armed Forces Maj. Gen. Aziz Nasirzade said, “The key lesson from the Ukraine war is that you cannot close your eyes on deterrence and talk about limiting your missile (military) power.”

&gt; * Negotiating with the U.S. government about Iran’s missile program is seen as risky and unreliable, while Tehran’s homegrown missile capabilities are portrayed as ensuring deterrence and stability.

&gt; * In addition, the Ukraine war will likely impact the thinking about Iran’s missile doctrine, especially the ways in which its missile forces should be employed at a tactical level.

&gt; * The Ukrainian case is proving that sustaining missile fires on enemy positions is both feasible and effective in a large conventional war as well. Especially when deterrence has failed and war is inevitable, missiles can help compensate for the absence of air power on the tactical level.

&gt; * For a country like Iran, which has an old fleet of fighter jets in need of modernization, the performance of the Russian Air Force in Ukraine provides critical lessons.

&gt; * …the Ukraine war may change the balance of power within the Iranian military establishment in favor of those who prioritize missiles over conventional airpower.

&gt; *  U.S. sources estimate that the failure rate for some Russian precision-guided missiles is as high as 60%.

&gt; * such a high failure rate means that more missiles have to be fired at a single target.

&gt; * Bellingcat reported that Russia has likely used 70% of its stockpile of precision missiles.

&gt; * …likely to spark debate among Iran's defense industries and the IRGC about the size of the country’s missile stockpile and how its maintenance systems can be improved.

&gt; * What can be stated with certainty is that the Iranian military has interpreted the war in Ukraine as evidence that it made the right choice in making missiles a pillar of its deterrence strategy

&gt; * The war has provided invaluable insights about the operational requirements of employing missiles in a major war as well. However, the conflict has also highlighted the downsides of relying on missile forces: The Russian experience shows that precision missile strikes are unlikely to decisively affect the course of a war. They have limited value in taking and holding territory and are insufficient to secure a military victory. Missile strikes cannot transform the battlefield and create a politically favorable outcome.

The Middle East Institute (MEI) is a non-profit, non-partisan think tank and cultural center in Washington, D.C., founded in 1946.[2] It seeks to ""increase knowledge of the Middle East among the United States citizens and promote a better understanding between the people of these two areas.""[3]

&gt; The UAE contributed $20 million over the course of 2016 and 2017 to the Middle East Institute.[9][10]

Nobody was predicting the hundreds of thousand  planes and tanks that were produced during ww2. Pre-war weapon systems are produced without real-world experience , not much competition and limited to no economies of scale, all with budgets in the low single digits as a percentage of gdp.

Stalin is famous for this, so is North Korea, and China is no exception.

Throughout most of human history governing structures were feudalistic and/or monarchal, before states transitioned into republics. Historical examples of contemporary armies and their respective states nevertheless carry hallmark markers which are also intimately affected by the political structure of the country and the army itself.

  And, as you may know, inside almost every crevice and corner of human history there are a myriad of examples where armies overthrow their rulers in quite stellar manners. Robsperrie would like to have a word.

Moreover, in the world where Russia starts general mobilization, Eastern European countries will **have to** react. In fact chances are Poland, Finland and the Baltics will have to mobilize as well, but also will have a high incentive to bog down the Russians in Ukraine as much as possible, lest it's their cities that will get bombed and invaded next.

The rest of Europe will also react, we've already saw a tectonic shift in Italian, French, Spanish and similar policy when it comes to self armament and armament of Ukraine.

Just to be clear, you're talking about munitions and things like launchers and cannons, right?  I work in aircraft turbofan manufacturing and we have tons of automation, even on military programs.  Assembly may often happen by hand (both military and commercial), but typically most components were made by NC machine tools and other heavily automated processes, which represents the bulk of the value.

&gt; There is nothing you can do before hand to rationally set up a mass production line for any weapon systems that may be useful in the ""big one"" war. 1) you don't know what will be useful in the next war, 2) the ""big one"" wars are very rare and infrequent.

I don't disagree, the question was more along the lines of ""given that certain munitions (and *which* specific ones you obviously weren't able to predict ahead of time or you'd have ordered more of them to begin with) have been unexpectedly depleted, what would it take to get a defense industrial base that could rapidly replenish them if it was a matter of national importance?""

&gt; You can retain some service in-house weapon R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities, and have teams of people exercising and planning for realistic mass-manufacturing plans for any and all weapons currently in service. Places like the Springfield Armory used to do that for US Army small-arms. In peace time, they will come up with detailed and theoretical mass production plans and manufacturing know-hows to be ready to hand off to private contractors during war time. By means of industrial policy, a country can retain certain manufacturing sector and capacity that may be converted to war time use. 

Do you know to what extent this is still done?  It seems that smaller scale versions of this are probably still feasible and could be part of the legwork the DOD does on their side of the fence during the procurement process.  Something like emergency replenishment of ATGMs, for example, probably wouldn't require a nation-wide mobilization of manufacturing, but rather an index of widely distributed, capable vendors who have the tools and resources to perform the manufacturing and quality work, could potentially produce first articles or do some sort of readiness assessment, and then set that aside.

&gt; * Protection, or survivability as it tends to be called, is one of the three pillars of AFV capability that we all like to talk about (the others being firepower and mobility). But what is AFV protection, and why is it important to see it as more than just armour? This is purely an introductory post on the basic concept of survivability, there are a range of more specific primers that I have written and have in the pipeline.

&gt; * Protection is much more than simply resisting an attempt by a threat projectile to penetrate into the inside of a vehicle. To try and visualise the more holistic nature of protection, the concept of the 'survivability onion' is commonly used. You are at the core of the onion, hoping not to be killed, and around you are conceptual sequential layers of protection that are at increasing physical distance from you.

Sure, but again under this scenario, Russia has millions more troops, those can be used to guard specific important railway infrastructure (like bridges), man the border, new units to quickly repair any damage and so on. Hell if this drags on long enough, even to lay new rail lines.

Modern weapons are assembled by hands, by skilled workers, one-by-one,, as if they are sports or luxury cars. There is no Detroit, conveyor belt, mass production for anything other than small arms ammunition. 

Why? Because the rate of peace time consumption of any item is vastly smaller and slower than actual war time consumption. The USA manufactured some 49,000 Sherman tanks in WWII. There is no rational order of battle for 49,000 M1 Abrams tanks. A few hours and days of serious air combat will blow up an entire year's worth of aircraft manufacturing. Those are \*very low\* production number, given that cars and trucks plants produce hundreds to thousands to millions of aircrafts per year. 

There is *nothing* you can do before hand to rationally set up a mass production line for any weapon systems that may be useful in the ""big one"" war. 1) you don't know what will be useful in the next war, 2) the ""big one""  wars are very rare and infrequent.

Still, there are things you may be able to do, just in case. You can retain some service in-house weapon R&amp;D and manufacturing capabilities, and have teams of people exercising and planning for realistic mass-manufacturing plans for any and all weapons currently in service. Places like the Springfield Armory used to do that for US Army small-arms. In peace time, they will come up with detailed and theoretical mass production plans and manufacturing know-hows to be ready to hand off to private contractors during war time. By means of industrial policy, a country can retain certain manufacturing sector and capacity that may be converted to war time use. For example: light aircraft manufacturing --&gt; drone manufacturing. Tractor and locomotive manufacturing ---&gt; tank and armoured vehicle manufacturing. etc ...

In the end, though, everyone will be caught with their pants down in the next ""big one"". Ammunition consumption are usually much higher than expected.

People like this who yearn for the days of overwhelming collectivism (nationalism, fascism, communism, religious unity, or any other flavor), how do they propose to deal with people’s desire for better quality of life and more individual freedom?  

That’s a pretty powerful force, and the pursuit of ‘hedonistic’ materialism has (aka consumerism) been the driver of innovation and progress since, well, starting with Renaissance, through industrial revolution and to the modern day.  It has been largely responsible for the rise of the West, and now for the rise of the rest.

I understand that collectivism is a necessary tool when the environment is extremely hostile, and Russia in particular has been an excellent user of this tool in the past.  However, the world is a bit different today (I should say has been).  There has not been an army in Europe capable of threatening Moscow since 1990s until 2022, and the only reason there is enough NATO buildup enough to threaten Moscow in 2022 is in reaction to Moscow’s aggressiveness.

As a saying goes, if you love your hammer, everything looks like a nail.  Does collectivism serve people, or do people serve collectivism?  If Russia  truly valued its people, it should have wielded a different tool, materialism, during last 30 years to enrich and to develop the nation.  Look at nations like China, Poland, Vietnam, and so on.  They have done fabulously well. In stead, Russia is only capable of being a slave to a tool.",984674dec94631cbc2ab9ae5ccdb3c300294a4c8,True,False,,,,,0,1651547295,,0,{},i744k4e,False,t3_ugo0q5,False,True,t1_i72cmtr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ugo0q5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_02_2022/i744k4e/,1651547308,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651518495.0
[],False,,smt1,,,[],,,,text,t2_4cr5e,False,False,"&gt;he needs to sell to his people the idea that Ukraine is a dangerous, war-mongering neighbor that needs to be neutralized.

hasn't he already done that? I mean, the narrative is that Ukraine is led by a government full of ""Nazis"", and a not so insignificant amount of people believe that. I guess that type of narrative would go on overdrive if there was a full mobilisation. 

Sort of like a full court press like what Igor Girkin delivered today (here is the last part of it):

&gt;But now the citizens of the Russian Federation are offered not the ideology of ""war for Russia"" at all, no! - They are called upon to sacrifice their lives for the sake of both ""demilitarization and some kind of denazification"" of the so-called ""Ukraine"". but are there many people in the Russian Federation who care about who is in power in Ukraine - Nazis or not? - Such people certainly exist. And it's not that there are very few of them. But in order to wage a full-fledged war with the Nazis, it’s not enough ... it’s definitely not enough (not to mention the fact that the authorities of the Russian Federation itself are not very eager to involve such people as much as possible). And the bulk, in general, do not care about who rules in Kyiv - ""Nazi"" Zelensky or our ""pro-Russian"" (ugh!) Medvedchuk.
&gt;
&gt;And no one even tries to explain to the citizens of the Russian Federation that Ukraine is a historical part of Russia, and its population is not some kind of ""fraternal people"", but naturally part of our Russian people (and not the worst part of it, if we take physical health and intelligence). Moreover, without Ukraine, Russia in the future will certainly continue to wither and dry (just like Ukraine, by the way, without the rest of Russia). And the only way to avoid a sad end is to reunite Ukraine, for which sacrifices are needed.
&gt;
&gt;Part of our people and part of our country were seized by the Nazis, placed at their service and fooled the population. And they intend to capture us after that, to make our life even worse than it is now. In general: ""GET UP RUSSIAN PEOPLE!""
&gt;
&gt;With slogans and how to present these to the population, I believe, it is more or less clear. In very simple words: WAR must go for the liberation of the Russian people and the Russian Land from the Nazis. And nothing else. 
&gt;
&gt;And people who are not seen in a ""constructive partnership"" with these same Nazis should command and lead. (And if the entities that are ""noticed"" are so ""indispensable"", then at least put them in the shade for a while, as under Stalin they ""put them in the shade"" (and many deeper) representatives of the ""Comintern"" with their completely failed ideas like - ""worker to worker is always a friend and brother! The German proletarian will not fight against the Soviet one!"").
&gt;
&gt;Now about the strategic goals. - They must fully comply with the slogans and ideology.
&gt;
&gt;In order for Ukraine to never again become a threat to Russia, it must COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR AS A STATE. In general - even within the framework of ""autonomy"". 
&gt;
&gt;Otherwise, the threat will remain that someday the rotten, the evil dwarf of ""independence"" will come out again with a portrait of Bandera on his left boob and a swastika on his right. And it will be inherited by our descendants. For Russia's security, the existence of an ""independent state of Ukraine"" is unacceptable in principle.  
&gt;
&gt;The political strategy, therefore, should be aimed at the complete destruction of the ""Ukrainian state"", and not at the ""change of ideology."" And - accordingly - on this basis, a military strategy that has a chance of success should be developed. And under it, the tools and resources necessary for successful implementation should line up.  
&gt;
&gt;Ukraine is part of Russia and should return to the Russian state (all or most of it is a tactical question). Everyone who opposes this or tries to prevent it is the essence of the enemy. Both outside and inside. And enemies in war are always dealt with quickly and ruthlessly. Otherwise it is impossible. Mercy can and should be shown after overcoming the adversary.

1. I’ve not found anything stating that Ukraine is using starlink for tactical military traffic. If you have a source please send it. That would be incredibly unwise, however [limited anecdotal reports](https://mobile.twitter.com/dpatrikarakos/status/1519303470192410624) suggest that Russia has indeed been able to strike at Ukrainian comms forcing them to use starlink. It’s not possible to determine the extent or pattern of usage of this technology. That being said, it’s inherently a bad idea to use civilian satellite infrastructure in this sense.

2. No. Your second point is not correct, nor consistent with the current dialogue around the survivability of command posts in the face of Russian/Chinese electromagnetic spectrum targeting capabilities.

Sources:

&gt; Strong signals travel farther—all the way to the adversary’s DF receivers. Generally, manpack radio battery power is low, vehicle radio power is stronger, and generator-equipped command post radio power is strongest. CP signals are more vulnerable ​and​ more valuable to the adversary.

&gt;When we increase radio power in response to attempted enemy jamming, we increase our vulnerability to adversary DF units. This is an adversary TTP.

http://www.2ndbn5thmar.com/EMCON/EP%20EMCON%20SOP.pdf

&gt;Man-made systems emit electromagnetic energy both intentionally and unintentionally. This component of RF MASINT involves the collection and analysis of RINT or spurious emissions from military and civil engines, power sources, weapons systems, electronic systems, machinery, equipment, instruments, or “leaky” electronic containers. One can, for example, determine the frequency to which a receiver is tuned by detecting the frequency of an oscillator inside a superheterodyne receiver. Truck and tank engines radiate electromagnetic energy from spark plugs. Electrical generators emit a strong signal associated with the generator’s rotor movement. These emissions create a signature that can have intelligence use for locating a vehicle, identifying it, and tracking it as it moves. Leaving an opening in an electronic system, such as an open access door in a radar van, can give rise to an unintentional signal with a signal strength and frequency that relate to the size and shape of the opening and the intermediate frequency of the radar,even in standby mode.

Yet another source making the same exact point:

&gt; The Russian military’s ability to quickly find and destroy Ukrainian command posts made that manifest, Crawford acknowledged. Other nations may have the same ability, although Crawford declined to name them.

&gt;Command posts must be more survivable and mobile, the Army has concluded. Currently, peer competitors would be able to easily locate a command post through its **electromagnetic signals, or even signatures given off by power generators.**

https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2017/12/1/army-scrambles-to-make-command-posts-survivable


3. No, actually. As I’ve repeatedly pointed out, the various systems in a main command post produce electronic emissions that the Russian military has the capability to collect and analyze for direction finding/geolocation. You’re framing this as though I’m discussing some hypothetical future technology. I’m not. As I’ve repeatedly said through various sources directly from the U.S. military, it’s a widely accepted fact that the typical command post has a distinct electromagnetic signature through its various generators and communication equipment that can be detected through EW platforms and electro-optical MASINT sensors. Your assertion that the equipment inside a command post produces a signature smaller than a microwave is incorrect. If you have some sources to the contrary beyond your own speculation, please provide them.

This isn’t a hypothetical issue. And no, your handwaving about remote antennae [doesn’t mean anything](https://cove.army.gov.au/article/electronic-warfare-threat-command-post-perspective) substantial.

1. Purchase a massive stockpile one time that has all the quantity you'll ever need, given that you know your supply chain is functioning today and you can't predict the future

2. Maintain no stockpile at all but star-trek replicator weapons into existence exactly when they're needed

Obviously any realistic procurement is going to be some combination of the two strategies.  The latter has little to no waste, but requires a completely secured supply chain and manufacturing capabilities that we don't quite have yet.  The former has massive waste but can be done with modern supply chains and provides a reasonable level of certainty.

If the US defense industrial base moved towards having broadly distributed, rapid, flexible manufacturing systems, discriminating use of the second strategy would be able alleviate some of the need for the first.  

I think certainly within some of the mechanical portions of industry (CNC machining and grinding, additive, and certain types of castings) we've been able to distance ourselves from single purpose or specialized tooling, which means that those pockets of industry can potentially be redirected quickly.  I believe that certain parts of electronics and PCB manufacturing are similarly or more flexible and can churn out large numbers of heterogenous jobs on demand.

Moscow doesn't really care what happens to Donbas but cares very much about neutralising Ukraine, as a hostile country of 40 million armed by the West, at least in the medium term. That is why they took a huge gamble with this war.

Just a note, Putin is not in immediate danger of a palace coup and likely won't be even if this war ends badly. His public support is high, his media control is strong, and the elites have largely rallied to his banner because he presents stability in this crisis. China is on good terms with Putin, as are Lukashenko, Modi, and Bolsanaro, aka people who matter to Russia internationally. A coup, a truly violent ""take him outside and shoot him"" coup causes a ton of issues, doesn't solve Russia's problems, and opens up the likelihood of a popular revolt. If there was to be a ""coup"" it would not be Putin being sent to the gulag or a Kremlin dumpster, it would mostly likely be Putin being shuffled off into ""retirement"" in his dacha until he dies. What might tip the scales against him would be a loss of popular support (such as in the event of mobilization) or, dare I say, trying to order the Russian elite to commit essentially mass suicide by nuclear weapons. The Russian elite like being able to take fancy vacations and live in fancy houses and make themselves richer off of corruption. They can't do any of that if Russia is glassed.  


Also, Putin's family, as far as we know, are not hiding in a nuclear bunker in Siberia. His current mistress/partner lives in Switzerland with their sons if rumors are be believed, she might be back in Russia but if she is she's pretty low profile (meaning she probably can escape the country quickly if push comes to shove). Even if there was a coup, they would be fine, because none of them are connected to the political process. Putin's daughters are both largely unconnected with politics and live in Moscow. One is a doctor/medical researcher and the other is a tech executive. I don't think any Russian elite is going to string them up in the event of a coup because they have zero claim to any part in the political process. They are not threats. So his family is relatively safe, all things considered.
