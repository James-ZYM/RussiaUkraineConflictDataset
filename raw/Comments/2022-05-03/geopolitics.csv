Similar to Asia. Countries have either condemned or remained neutral because they have interests in both countries through arms supplies etc.

- Family has been the major benefactor of the Trump’s success. Modi’s family lives ordinary life despite him being successful in politics for decades.
- Trump has, I am not sure how many wives and has been an womaniser. Modi has renounced the normal world and has no women.
- Trump speaks anything and everything. Every word coming out of Modi’s mouth is calculated 
- Trump gives answers to press Infact he likes to give back to media people, Modi clearly doesn’t enjoy press 
- Trump is impulsive and reactive, Modi is manipulative, always in control

China has always been strategically exposed with fossil fuels. They're the world's #1 carbon importer, and much of their imports require access to sea lanes. That's a huge vulnerability. Until 2020, Australia was China's #1 source of coal imports. From a strategic perspective, that's about as untenable as it gets. 

If Russia is forced to pivot to Asia, that would be a huge get for Beijing - China would be able to absorb all of Russia's production and end up with access to resources that are all but immune to interdiction. A glaring weakness becomes a strength. 

Russia seems to have already decided on just such a pivot. They've agreed to sell oil to India for rupees (which is itself a huge win for India), and are working on substitution to replace EU products. China has agreed to pay for Russian oil with Euros. The important thing is, Russia is not approaching this like it's a short-term crisis that will be resolved soon. 

Such an outcome would be a disaster for the West, but the animosity has probably passed the point of no return. The only way the EU is basking in Russian gas in 5 years is if Putin's regime capitulates or is deposed. 

So how does this play out for China? If Putin's regime survives but is cut off from the West, China wins. If Putin's regime collapses and is replaced by an NATO-compliant government, China's containment situation gets worse. Russia helped the US in the early days of the Afghanistan invasion. The last thing Beijing wants to see is US land-forces based in Russia.

You see, the Democratic Republic of Congo is rich in Cobalt and Copper. Cobalt increases battery life and energy density, making it a highly sought after metal for lithium-ion batteries in smart devices and EVs. Copper is also in high demand, used for electrical and electronics wiring for its high density. Any attempts by external forces to intervene using national funds will put these strategic interests first and foremost.

Given the US' history in backing coups to install a new government, it has been as a result of national interest, whether security or economic. It can be done repeatedly such as in Venezuela in 2002 and then in 2020 as Operation Gideon, or in cases of success such as the 1973 coup in Chile and the 1976 coup in Argentina. If cobalt and copper prices continue to rise beyond their prices now which are at all-time highs, this may be a viable option in the US' interest.

The US will likely work closely with the government of the DRC to establish a more diplomatic and subservient government that will accede to the demands of the US. Funds may be channeled as part of a US-backed operation to pay off local militia and key military personnel.

[],False,,bnav1969,,,,,,"A couple reasons.

First thing first, is that much of the disputed territory is pretty bad and has no inherent value. There are no historical Indian or Chinese peoples in these territories (unlike Taiwan or Crimea), there is very little nationalistic value associated for (the Russians lost 200k men to defend and then retake Crimea, one of the bloodiest battles in ww2).

Second is geography. The entire area is the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. Only a lunatic would try to attack properly over such territory and mostly get destroyed by the defender. Going into geography, Aksai Chin is extremely important because it connects Tibet to Xinjiang both far and volatile Chinese provinces that play a major role in Chinese strategic depth and power. There is no other route from Tibet to Xinjiang on the west. So you can see the geographic necessity of it. And to add more support it is significantly harder for the Chinese to defend arunachal - in the 1962 war China pushed forward, declared a unilateral cease fire and pulled back to defensible places. This was also under their most aggressive leader. 

In fact, in 1960, before the 1962 Sino Indian War, Zhou Enlai tried to negotiate Aksai Chin from nehru in exchange for settled borders that left arunachal with India. The reason for these negotiations is that China held India as a vestige of the British empire and thus many of its borders were drawn through the empire. Add to this, that Kashmir / Tibet were very remote territories with border disputes in between themselves. The McMahon line, which India claimed as the border between itself and Tibet (so China in this case), was negotiated by the British. It's kind of true but kind of an excuse to get Aksai Chin. 

Third, despite all the claims of Chinese aggression, China borders 14 states and initially had border disputes with all of them. All but 2 of those borders (India and Bhutan) were peaceably settled and fairly - even the most rabid sino phobe could not deny that the Chinese were pretty fair with all these borders. And generally the Chinese strategy is to over claim and negotiate away (sort of like Krushchev using the Cuban missiles to get the Jupiter missiles out of turkey). This is very likely Chinese goals because Arunachal isn't that important to China and its likely a negotiation tactic. India has actually been relatively stubborn when it comes to negotiations, partially because it's not that important but mostly because all of these regions are part of Kashmir which has its own saga with Pakistan. India generally says it won't negotiate until the UN terms are met (which means Pakistani withdrawal from their portion and Chinese withdrawal too - i think) so that's been stuck for 70 years. 

Finally, there's the Indian themselves. Arunachal Pradesh is a state of India, it's people are proudly Indian (there was a pretty strong separatist insurgent movement in northeast India which is mostly done and resolved pretty reasonably). India itself will absolutely defend arunachal (likely with nukes). Arunachal itself is also in the northeast of India which is a geographic weakness for India if you look at a map. A Chinese foothold inside that is simply unacceptable. Arunachal is pretty defensible and India has enough assets there to defend it. Any Chinese leader who tried a war to take it would probably be deposed for the stupidity. (much of the same applies for India taking aksai chin BTW).",1f045ca7f05abf6f31a7a28b696588033a84e70a,True,False,,,,,0,1651560553,,0,{},i74q2qn,False,t3_uefckh,False,True,t1_i73sel6,/r/geopolitics/comments/uefckh/xis_global_security_initiative_looks_to_counter/i74q2qn/,1651560565,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651531753.0,[],text,t2_rqa20,False,False,
[],False,,TheGreatAteAgain,,,,,,"A good place to start is looking up the ""Greed and Grievance"" theories of intrastate conflict. Greed theories state that civil wars start because of poverty, static or dropping GDP, lack of job opportunities, etc. Grievance theories argue that they start because of lack of civil rights, representation. plurality, etc. 

I haven't done any research myself for at least 10 years, but can point you to some resources. Here's an overview of the two as well as Collier's famous paper on the ""Greed"" theory, which is the prevailing theory. I'll also attach some website that conglomerate data from many organizations. These are the website that researchers use for most of the studies and you can look up specific countries to look at statistics like GDP growth, external arms or aid, political freedom ranking, natural resources, etc.

A very common example of the two theories in action would be Syria. Believers of the grievance theory would say a lack of political rights as well as a non-pluralist system that saw Alawites put into the positions that actually exercised real power gave rise to the revolution when the Arab spring hit. Greed theorist would argue that a stagnating GDP, job growth as well as a severe drought that created huge unemployment and movement from the countryside to the cities created a dissatisfied population with many unemployed males eager to take up arms to feel useful or gain money.

I tend to believe it's a combination of both, but the statistics show economic factors are always the biggest factors.

[],False,,theshitcunt,,,,,,"&gt;The only reason anyone in Crimea self-identifies as Russian is because of Russian ethnogenicide of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people

That article talks about 1944. What that article doesn't tell you is that the Tatars only accounted to about 35.5% of the population as far back as 1897, 25% in 1926, and as low as 19.4% in 1939. They're 10-15% as of 2014 (depending on the poll), so the deportation ended up not having that much effect. The Tatars had been leaving Crimea for the Ottoman Empire since 1783. The reasons for this are too long, I'm already hitting character limit. And yes, Ukrainians (Cossacks) and Tatars didn't really see eye to eye.

They are also not ""indigenous"", I take it you're trying to fit into the colonization narrative. Crimea is originally Christian Greek (or Taurian, if you're willing to go this far back), that's why Vladimir the Great was baptized there when he captured the city in circa 988. Tatars are the invaders, the khanate is a successor of the Mongol Empire, and they only held complete control over the land for three centuries, between 1475 and 1783 (they also invaded a couple time prior to that and forced to pay tribute, but didn't establish an administration). Before that the population was a weird mix of Cumans, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgars, Goths and Alans; all Christians and Pagans. The Tatar ethnos is has its base in Cumans, the Turkish Steppe people.

&gt;When were they asked if they wanted to give up sovereignty to Russia

That's the point, the weren't asked, because the answer was obvious. The 1994 referendum was overturned by Ukraine. Crimean governing bodies were liquidated and its Constitution abolished (google President of Crimea). I am not sure why you're doubting their sentiments, they've been pretty vocal every time.

&gt;other than the referendum under Russian military occupation that had numerous different aspects and allegations of Russian interference and fraud?

Show me a single poll/election where they weren't owerwhelmingly in favor of independency, Russia or pro-Russian politicians.
A [German GfK poll](https://avaazpress.s3.amazonaws.com/558_Crimea.Referendum.Poll.GfK.pdf) several days before the referendum indicated that [those willing to join Russia outnumber those willing to stay with Ukraine 7-to-1](https://i.imgur.com/C0SeiiT.png). They tried again a year later:
[In February 2015, a poll by German polling firm GfK revealed that attitudes have not changed. When asked “Do you endorse Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”, a total of 82% of the respondents answered “yes, definitely,” and another 11% answered “yes, for the most part.”. Only 2% said they didn't know, and another 2% said no.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/) - pretty similar to the referendum numbers. As you can see, even the majority of Tatars support the annexation, the Tatar abuse was overblown by the Western media, it was mainly their leaders who were pissed.

Note that I am not opining on whether the annexation was legal or justified, I am merely commenting on the sentiments of the population.

&gt;The Ukrainian government recognized the remaining Tatars’ own legislative and executive representative bodies

What you don't mention is that it only did so AFTER the annexation. I wonder what was stopping them all these years?

&gt;Russia labeled the Tatar representation as an “extremist organization,”

Well, that's because they were acting like one. The leaders moved to Ukraine and started doing stuff like [blocking food trucks going to the peninsula](https://khpg.org/en/1441807392) (basically wanted to cause famine, hoping it would lead to unrest), [stopping any water running through the North Crimean canal](https://www.ft.com/content/5eda71fc-d678-41cd-ac5a-d7f324e19441) (leading to massive droughts and water rationing), and sabotaging the power supply of Crime ([blowing up power lines](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/23/world/europe/power-lines-to-crimea-are-blown-up-cutting-off-electricity.html)), finally earning them a ban in 2016.

Anyone should agree those leaders were a tad uncooperative and not really benefitting their people (unless you think that freezing and starving is what Tatars desire most), and their actions are indeed extremist. If you don't think so, imagine far-right activists blowing up power lines and building water dams to restrict water flow to pursue their goals. Would you describe them as ""extremists""?

As for the Tatars themselves: [""The proportion of Tatars who indicated that they thought being part of Russia would make them better off rose from 50 percent in 2014 to 81 percent in 2019""](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2020-04-03/russia-love) - [no paywall](https://archive.is/xpB0H)

&gt;Gee, I wonder if there is a common factor here involving relocation/dissemination/oppression of local populations and colonization

That's a weird take. Why nurture nationalism when you can simply assimilate? Have you heard of Korenizatsia and nation-building?
It was quite the opposite, the Bolsheviks wanted not a restoration of the Russian Empire, but an actual union of many liberated nations to show the world the massive support for communism. Dozens of countries living in communism sounded much better than a single restored Russia. Also, decolonizing rhetoric was supposed to help start uprisings in the capitalist colonies. Similar thing actually happened in China, they modelled it after the Bolsheviks.

Crimea was transferred to Ukraine in 1954 because it didn't share a land corridor with Russia and Moscow was too far away, it made more sense to let the local authorities govern it. This is why Crimea is so dependant on Ukrainian water and energy. No one expected the Union to ever break up, it was simply a matter of governing territories more efficiently.

If you actually want to control the population, you assimilate it (like the Tatars did), not introduce many new centers of power where there were none. Nation-building and Korenizatsiya ended up backfiring.

Abkhazia is a victim of Georgian imperialism. Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, wanted to merge Georgia, Armenia, Abkhazia and Azerbaijan into a single entity (Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic), but lacked the influence to complete it and only ended up merging Georgia and Abkhazia. It's a bit more complicated than these but the reply is already too long.

Transnistria has never been part of historical Romania/Moldova, it was proclaimed as Moldavian ASSR simply because Russia lost Moldova and the Bolsheviks wanted to have yet another people in their union of liberated proletariat. In 1897, that region (Tiraspolsky Uyezd, part of Kherson Governorate) only had 25% Moldovans; 34.1% in 1993. You can imagine why the population was pissed to find itself in Moldova following the breakup of the USSR.

Fergana Valley exists simply because prior to the USSR, borders were pretty much non-existant in the region, [they had to be made from scratch](https://i.imgur.com/UK4D8u0.png), and many regions were too intermixed to make proper borders possible. Google Razmezhevanie.
