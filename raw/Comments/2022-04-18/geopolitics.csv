[],False,,old_faraon,,,[],,,,text,t2_ddaqw,False,False,"&gt;If Yanukovych had stayed in power, or was deposed in an election rather than fleeing the nation at gunpoint, does the 2014 annexation of Crimea occur? 

In case of elections yes but Lugansk and Donbas would probably be less successful since Ukraine would not be weakened. If Yanukovytch stayed and suppressed the protests successfully then no, but that's not really a choice he had.

Now the main choice would be Him signing the AA, not having Euromaidan and surviving customs barriers from Russia (and protests in the East). Then probably no, but I'm not sure. But that would be alienating part of his core electorate.  

&gt;  I think U.S support was vital to Euromaidan occuring, and that it was a terrible idea to oust a duly elected leader who was popular in eastern Ukraine.

And unpopular in the West, the election was close and Ukraine was flipping between pro West and Russian options since since 2005. With the the increasing distance between Ukraine and the former WP countries that integrated with the West the pro West pull was becoming stronger and Yanukovytch was going against it. Going for more economic integrations with the Eurasian Union instead of the EU would not mean prosperity for Ukraine. If Yanukovytvh played both sides appeasing Russia on security and integrating economically with the West like he was (assuring) of doing before the protest the Euromaidan doesn't happen.

All that the Nuland transcripts show is that US wanted to support people that they can work with (the moderates) over more fringe factions by promising them support. They even seem surprised by Yanukovytch actions, that hardly looks like orchestration. It also shows that accusations of the US supporting far right are bollocks because they wanted to cut them out of the scene. In the end it would be stupid to support them since they don't love the US or the West either. 

&gt;massacre of 10s of Russian-speaking Trade Unionists in Odessa,

Russian fanned the flames of violent protest like it did in Lugansk and Donieck, this time it failed with horrible consequences. Organizing violent protests against the majority and provoking escalation is risky. 

&gt; Ukraine in 2014 could have very easily ended up taking the EU deal if a trilateral agreement with Russia had been made, but instead Russia was told to bugger off by the EU, though it was reasonably seeking assurances that its trade agreements with Ukraine would not lead to EU goods wrecking the Russian economy.  

How a trilateral deal would work? You cannot be it two customs Unions at the same time. You cannot harmonize with two different bodies of law. The barriers to trade with Russia would have to come. Ukraine was not negotiating a free trade deal but an Association Agreement. Armenia was in a similar position and chose a trade agreement instead (probably due to pressure from Russia). 

The lack of success of Russians instigating protests in places other then parts of Lugansk and Donetsk points to there being majority support for the deal. And Yanukovitch saying he is willing to sign it to the last moment while energetically dealing with Russia points to him thinking it would unpopular to reject it.

Now the most peaceful option for Ukraine would signing a trade deal with the EU but not a AA and milking the trade going through them while slowly westernizing the law and fighting corruption. But that would be still be threat to the Russian regime even if not to Russia as a state (how come they can have no oligarchs and we have to suffer). And part of the gain from an AA is that it requires passing rule of law test, it might be not perfect but it sure is better the an organized kleptocracy. 

&gt; That is an existential threat and that calls for war in a way that even the relatively timid, scheming, ""realpolitik"" Putin can't ignore.

I too believe that Ukrainian integration with the West it is a existential threat to Putin's regime and  Russian position as an empire  (or Great Power). But staying neutral would mean poverty for Ukraine and joining the Eurasians Union would mean  even more poverty and maybe the disappearance of the Ukrainian. 

And Russia has no bargaining chips here for it's, it cannot offer Ukraine security guaranties like it did for Armenia (since Ukraine can take care of Hungary on it's own), or support it's regime like Belarus and it sure as hell cannot manage it's own economy to grow even without sanctions. 

So the west would have actively deny Ukraine in order to to give Russia what it want's, and Russia has nothing to barter with for this deal. 

&gt; The goal is preserving the peace while avoiding a Cold War.  

Is it? The US is mostly isolated of the effects and can do whatever is preferential electorally(and bashing Russia is), Western Europe would like to eat it's cake an have it too (ie. using it's economical pull slowly but now is forced navigate a web of public support for Ukraine energy interests power plays), Britain looks to be still angry after Skripal with nothing to loose, while Eastern Europe would prefer a new Cold War but with them on the winning side this time.

[],False,,MauritanianHistory,,,[],,,,text,t2_3g8sklbz,False,False,"On the contrary, recognizing that Russia *currently* has little to rely on except military expansionism if they feel their core interests are at state - i.e the military alignment of their next-door neighbors - then we should expect Eastern Europe to become less peaceful if the West goes all-in on winning the tug-of-war. Plus, the goal is not preserving peace from Russian aggression in Eastern Europe at the expense of a new Cold War. The goal is preserving the peace *while* avoiding a Cold War. 

Hypothetically speaking: If Yanukovych had stayed in power, or was deposed in an election rather than fleeing the nation at gunpoint, does the 2014 annexation of Crimea occur? I don't think so. I think U.S support was vital to Euromaidan occuring, and that it was a terrible idea to oust a duly elected leader who was popular in eastern Ukraine.

If the U.S didn't try to handpick his replacements (see the leaked Nuland phone call, among other things), if Ukrainian ultranationalists aren't coming to blows with Russian-speaking Ukrainians, including the massacre of 10s of Russian-speaking Trade Unionists in Odessa, does the nation split? I don't think so - after Yanukovych fled for his life, I think that the U.S and Russia had a chance to bring stability and unity back, but the former was clearly pushing out the latter, making this impossible.


 Washington courted the ultranationationalist factions who were at the forefront of further alienating the eastern regions before and after Euromaidan - remember that John McCain in 2013 was meeting with and expressing support for Svaboda's leaders, which is linked to groups like Right Sector who almost certainly were responsible for shooting civilians during Euromaidan. 

It takes two to tango, and Putin - despite years of Russian hardliners whining and moaning that he was too soft, too indecisive, not aggressive enough - did not take military action until it was clear that there was no intention at all by Washington to accomodate Russian interests in their next-door neighbor, a state that had a sizable Russian population which they saw was being abused (the Odessa trade union massacre was infuriated the Russians). 

Now on the issue of pulling back - I don't think it makes Eastern Europe less safe. I think that everything we've seen from Russia before it went to war on the 24th proves the opposite. So long as a *military alliance* - i.e NATO - is off the table, Russia was content to live with EU expansion and democratic reform up to its border. Ukraine in 2014 could have very easily ended up taking the EU deal if a trilateral agreement with Russia had been made, but instead Russia was told to bugger off by the EU, though it was reasonably seeking assurances that its trade agreements with Ukraine would not lead to EU goods wrecking the Russian economy. 

This and several other junctures where Russia was clearly open to work out a modus vivendi with the West on trade and even political concessions give me, personally, the impression that Russia was happy with the way the game was being played in ""neutral"" countries. 

But NATO expansion ends that - it makes it so that any nation is not just permanently out of Russian reach, and capable of treating Russian influence as a security threat and gaining Washington's support to block Russia out, but also that it could be a staging ground for anti-Russian interests and operations, under the protection of Washington, Paris, London and other governments who would be happy to see Russia collapse tomorrow for a number of reasons (look at France and Russia's competition in Libya, or the UK and Russia's competition in Syria etc). That is an existential threat and that calls for war in a way that even the relatively timid, scheming, ""realpolitik"" Putin can't ignore. Its also why he didn't nake up his mind to invade until very late, throwing everyone off-kilter and overseeing a pretty disastrous war for Russia.",a28fc58367b09177bb9346117fdd0c3c51e777e9,True,False,,,,,0,1650309546,,0,{},i58ulgw,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i58n2ia,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i58ulgw/,1650309562,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650280746.0,

Yet the stance of the military establishment, which wields huge power in the country, has also made its members targets of a social media campaign led by Khan’s supporters, who see the army as having played a role in the prime minister’s fall from power.

Libya was no longer designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, it gave up WMD programs and allowed for US monitoring, and even coordinated with US anti-terrorist efforts in the Sahara.

The US was initially reluctant in efforts against Gaddafi because he was seen as a stable presence, but pressure from Europe (especially France) and from liberals in the Obama administration wanting to support the Araba Spring (this is well-documented), it was eventually brought about to intervention. Many think this was a mistake though, because Libya has been extremely unstable post-Gaddafi, which is not beneficial to US interests. Non-intervention or even intervention on behalf of Gaddafi would have been more beneficial.

Likewise in Syria, although the US has never had any love for al-Assad, the attempted intervention there was extremely ineffective and quite possibly contributed to the rise of ISIS, which then required further US intervention to stamp out. Subsequently, Syria has become geopolitically aligned with Russia, which is definitely contrary to US interests. 

I think reluctance to become heavily involved in these conflicts contributed to US failure as well, but in both cases I think the *idea* of the Arab Spring trumped good policy making.",93adf2611073340532fe0f67815a029dd9b74d56,True,False,,,,,0,1650302109,,0,{},i58c11e,False,t3_u22n76,False,True,t1_i576q46,/r/geopolitics/comments/u22n76/how_the_west_got_russia_and_china_wrong_the/i58c11e/,1650302119,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650273309.0,

&gt;Elaborate on this ""fundamental power structure"", and how it is qualitatively different to the nice system of democratic checks and balances that went to war on Iraq based on even less legitimate security criteria.

Well as you mentioned when a nice system of checks and balances fails to protect you going to war , will no system of checks and balances be better? Dictatorships have to bend to the will of 1 person, not in all cases , but especially in Russia and other despotic states.
