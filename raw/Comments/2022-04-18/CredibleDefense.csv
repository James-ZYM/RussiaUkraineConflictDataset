[https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-18](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-18)

**""Key Takeaways**  
  
**Russian forces likely began large-scale offensive operations in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts focused on Rubizhne, Popasna, and Marinka.**  
**Russian forces may be able to gain ground through the heavy concentration of artillery and numbers. However, Russian operations are unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv. The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes—poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale—that impeded prior offensives.**  
**Successful Ukrainian counterattacks southeast of Kharkiv will likely force Russian forces to divert some units intended for the Izyum offensive, but Ukrainian forces are unlikely to completely sever Russian lines of communication north of Izyum in the coming days.**  
**Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol continued to hold out against heavy Russian artillery and air bombardment. ""**

ISW of course does not share Putin's optimistic appraisal of the situation. ""The Russian offensive in the east is unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous Russian offensives, but Russian forces may be able to wear down Ukrainian defenders or achieve limited gains. Russian forces did not take the operational pause that was likely necessary to reconstitute and properly integrate damaged units withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine into operations in eastern Ukraine. As we have assessed previously, Russian forces withdrawn from around Kyiv and going back to fight in Donbas have, at best, been patched up and filled out with soldiers from other damaged units, and the Russian military has few, if any, cohesive units not previously deployed to Ukraine to funnel into new operations.\[1\] Frequent reports of disastrously low Russian morale and continuing logistics challenges indicate the effective combat power of Russian units in eastern Ukraine is a fraction of their on-paper strength in numbers of battalion tactical groups (BTGs). Russian forces may certainly be able to wear down Ukrainian positions in eastern Ukraine through the heavy concentration of firepower and sheer weight of numbers, but likely at a high cost. A sudden and dramatic Russian offensive success remains highly unlikely, however, and Ukrainian tactical losses would not spell the end of the campaign in eastern Ukraine, much less the war as a whole.

In Syria Russia was in a support role assisting the SAA and other pro-Assad groups in first defending and then counterattacking to reclaim land lost to phase 3 insurgents, mostly performing air support in areas they had air dominance, ISR, assistance with training, logistics, mission planning, comms, etc. 

This current commander did one deployment there and rotated out being replaced by another. After that he was Southern Military District commander and ran the southern OSK joint HQ since day 1 of the war, controlling everything that happened roughly on line with the JFO all the way to Odessa and everything in the Black Sea. He wasn't suddenly brought in to unfuck anything, he was there the whole time and was only put in charge because his AO encompassed much of the new strategic focus in the Donbas and because he was more senior than the Northern Military District OSK commander before they smartened up and put one HQ in charge of the theater instead of stupidly having it split in two.

I think this is what they call a strawman in academic terms. A more charitable interpretation of my statements would imply that if the US was truly united and serious about defending Taiwan, they would have no qualms with implementing an official defensive military treaty with Taiwan, something it used to have with the ROC from 1950 until 1979. Of course, there will be no military treaty because Washington knows how China will react and has no wishes to retreat to nuclear missile silo bases over meaningless provocation. 

&gt; Clearly not with the president or White House though. And China hasn't changed their nuclear no first use rule. As for China's 'reddest' or red lines.

Comparing the China of the 1950s and 1960s to the China of the 2020s and 2030s is as baseless as comparing America of the 1890s and 1900s to the America of the 1950s and 1960s. China is without a doubt an uncontested regional hegemon and is a global near power compared to the impotent and fragile state it was in sixty years ago. Even more importantly, they are a nuclear power with irredentist claims that are popular domestically. Their threats should be taken extremely seriously and not casually dismissed. I thought people would have learnt this lesson after so being so blasé about Putin’s statements of invading Ukraine turned out not to be a prank after all.    

&gt; for the glorious PLA, they have the same issues of corruption and loyalty based promotions that destroyed the Russian army.

You will never find an official document, law, or memorandum detailing a firm US commitment to defend Taiwan. What you will find instead are numerous statements from almost every previous administration describing our ""strategic ambiguity"" towards Taiwan. I'm sure you know this, but in case you may not be completely aware, our security agreement with Taiwan is basically based on the premise that they will not formally declare independence from Mainland China, and that so long as they don't do that, there is a high likelihood that the US will commit forces to the defense of Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

More recently, President Biden made a statement [here late last year](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/28/1048513474/biden-us-taiwan-china) at a town hall where he simply said yes, the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by China ([https://www.npr.org/2021/10/28/1048513474/biden-us-taiwan-china](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/28/1048513474/biden-us-taiwan-china)). 

Of course, White House officials walked it back the next day and reaffirmed our official position on the matter--that there is officially only one China; that the status quo of non-formal independence and non-aggression by either party be recognized; that the US may or may not (though highly likely would) come to the defense of Taiwan.",0cb01c5f56bf3fc19b614294dd1b944edab5a4dd,True,False,,,,,0,1650317828,,0,{},i59em7a,False,t3_u6fhxx,False,True,t1_i5970bw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6fhxx/recent_assessments_have_called_for_taiwan_to/i59em7a/,1650317842,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650289028.0,

You're right, those aren't high-quality reserves like you might find in the USA.   They aren't trained groups with dedicated equipment.  Quality is also a concern. Quality-wise, it kind of goes like this:  NATO Soldier &gt; Russian Contract Soldier &gt; NATO reserve &gt; NATO Conscript &gt; Russian Reserve/Conscript.  Apparently they've tried to improve them but it has been unsuccessful. 

Timing is an issue. While Russia can deploy reserves, it will take months to mobilize them, train them, and equip them. Most of the major battles will likely be over by then.  Russia has already tried mobilizing some reserves but there are reports it has been going poorly. Ukraine is be doing the same thing, except they likely have better reserves (more motivated, volunteers first, western tech, better training, more recent combat experience due to Donbass, etc...). I seriously doubt Russia can mobilize reserves faster than Ukraine. The best thing about the Russian reserves is likely going to be helping with any war of attrition they might find themselves in within the next few months if it gets to that.  By then Russia will likely be running very low on bodies unless they start sending conscripts/reserves. 

That said, while the CURRENT problem for Russia might be warm bodies, the long-term problem is probably heavy equipment. Apparently not a lot of their stowed tank/IFV fleets are in working condition. Then again, that might be wishful thinking based on analyst reports. The biggest issue for both sides is likely materiel, logistics, and training. Not reserves.  A lot will depend on how much military aide (and what type/quantity) Ukraine gets. If they get tanks, IFVs, ammo, helicopters, and everything else they need, it won't matter what Russia does with reserves. They'll just be a bunch of extra dead men for Ukraine to bury.

Good video on the pros and cons of Germany’s surplus Leopard 1A5s for Ukranian service 

Strengths: 

* good mobility 

* modernized fire control system

* Can potentially deploy for longer periods of time than T-64s or T-72s 

Weaknesses: 

* poor armor by modern standards 

* mediocre main gun (outclassed by all tanks currently in both Russian and Ukrainian service) 

* new training required for operators and maintenance crews 

* potential difficulties with parts and logistics support 

* earliest they could be on the front after government approval is 2 months, and that would be under ideal conditions 

Conclusion: 

* Leopard 1A5 is old but not obsolete 

* still effective in combat if used creatively 

* probably best used on secondary fronts or to be able to free up Ukranian T-64s so that they can be transferred to where they are more needed 

* If these tanks were going to be maximally effective their transfer should have been approved weeks ago 

* these tanks are not junk and would still be useful on the battlefield",f2d698ea782ee4c7f3c563da7ace53b265758aab,True,False,,,,,0,1650312982,,0,{},i593466,False,t3_u6bgbg,False,True,t3_u6bgbg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6bgbg/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_18_2022/i593466/,1650312999,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650284182.0,

It doesn't look quite as dire for the Russians as earlier versions, as fighting has been much less intense since the Northern front collapsed. Will fighting stay at this low level? Will Russians start a new offensive? You decide, with the sliders.

First, Good training *absolutely* can adapt for all of those. And *most* of that training can be conducted with ""dry fire"" operations rather than ""live fire"" operations.

[],False,,CuriousAbout_This,,,[],,,,text,t2_i0hbe,False,False,"1. Electrification of the German heating systems would create more electricity demand overall.

2. In order to meet the demand Germany would have to heavily invest into renewables (provided that it wanted to avoid nuclear), which would be more expensive, less reliable and politically difficult. We both know about the NIMBY problems when it comes to windmills and the unreliability of wind power production combined with the mismatch of the solar power production. Solving that would require massive battery storage expenses which is what every single renewable-**only** advocate always forgets to consider.

I'm not even mentioning the rare earth mining dependency the world has on China and the massive amount of waste that renewables create.

3. The reason why nuclear is brought into the conversation when talking about independence from Russian gas is because it solves many of the problems of point 2. Here's your dependency.

4. When Germany is saying that it might stop using Russian gas by 2024, that doesn't mean that Germany would stop using gas. This means that gas costs would go up for the German consumers and industry.

5. Had Germany had the foresight to lower its reliance on **gas**, not only *Russian*-gas starting from 2014 and made plans to invest into its nuclear sector, by now it could have had a few nuclear power plants to be more independent from China (rare earth), Russia and the US&amp;Middle East (LNGs). Nuclear power is about strategic independence. 

6. The only problem with nuclear is **political** in Germany. German politicians and media are afraid of following the science and speaking factually about nuclear power, because it's easier to scare people than to educate them. This problem could be solved by grassroots and state media information campaigns.

7. So my suggestion would be to stop complaining about people who advocate in favor of nuclear power if your only argument against it is the problem that the Germans are not educated enough about nuclear and ignore the science.

&gt; * If realized, this will be the most significant re-envisioning of the role for helicopters since the AirLand Battle operational concept in the last decade of the Cold War.

&gt; * As U.S. force structure ages, moreover, affordability becomes even more difficult to achieve. Across the joint force, the Services mainly field platforms that were designed in the second half of the Cold War. For example, the bulk of the Army’s rotary-wing force today, the Chinook, Apache, and Black Hawk, was conceived before the 1980s. Similarly, the heart of the Navy’s surface fleet (Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, Ticonderoga-class cruisers, ArleighBurke-class destroyers, and Wasp-class amphibious assault ships) and much of the Air Force’s front line inventory (F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1, B-2, and the venerable B-52) have mid-to late-Cold War design pedigrees. Much of the Services’ logistical and support platforms and infrastructure also stem from that era.

&gt; * The last time such a coordinated perspective was developed and executed was in the 1970s. Unsurprisingly, it was this prior effort that bore the fruit that was the source of our post-First Gulf War overmatch. To stay relevant, DoD must pursue R&amp;D holistically and for the long-term, again.

The US is not alone in being stuck in the Cold War era when it comes to equipment and doctrine that shaped that equipment. Russia in the Ukraine war today has a force that often times looks like it is directly from 1988. 

It is incredible to think of the amount of money and man power that was spent on military hardware from 1945 to 1990. That is 45 years of a crazed build up that still shapes our world today.

China is a communist country:

\- whatever objective their (old) leaders want to achieve they have to do it sooner rather than later (no happy afterlife/heaven or whatever), talk about facing their own mortality.

\- reunification of China has always been a goal (soft or hard method doesn't matter)

\- highest priority for the reigning family is to maintain stability (read: no revolution) which is also a cultural trait (check Confucius)

from a strategic point of view: 

China is not Russia

\- much better trained military and much larger than Russia 

\- a lot of ongoing modernization (rocket forces), PLA navy, PLA air force and of course army, this said a lot of their tech is still largely Russian made or Russian influenced, a major emphasis is on how to counter the US navy

but

\- draconian discipline, some corruption still remaining -&gt; doesn't make your forces flexible

\- insufficient amphibious, airborne and naval assets for a full scale invasion 

Taiwan is not Ukraine:

\- much larger military and better equipped

\- island easier to defend (short term) since China's PLA would need to:

. have air superiority and preferably air supremacy (otherwise your paratroopers drops might go a bit wrong + air resupply effort would go the Dien Bien Phu way)

\- naval superiority + suppressed coastal defences -&gt; landing troops + resupplying them is kind of harder if your little boats/ships get often sunk

\- ground forces superiority if the first hours after the landings -&gt; not too nice to have landed 40k troops with some light armour if they are facing hundreds of thousands of trained soldiers with hundreds of tanks

oh and those 40k troops are what the PLA's current amphibious capability is able to land for the first wave so that means if everything goes according to plan....

China has no recent military experience, nor have they any serious experience fighting a modern army.

Korea was a failure, Vietnam was also a huge failure and 1949 Kinmen's battle is a very good reminder of how landings can go wrong quickly. (very interesting PLA's analysis about that failure)

all in all, if Taiwan is willing to continue modernizing its forces, less emphasis on its air force and more on SAM's (short, medium and long range) + anti-ship missiles the challenge will grow tougher for China no matter how much they expand their navy, air force and airborne forces, starving / blockading Taiwan would work much better than an invasion...at least for the next few years.",02bbd5119972c713fedf757ddd13752283a04593,True,False,,,,,0,1650297432,,0,{},i580dmt,False,t3_u5rixy,False,True,t3_u5rixy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5rixy/hostile_harbors_taiwans_ports_and_pla_invasion/i580dmt/,1650297452,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650268632.0,

This is the question many authoritarians have faced when losing a war - not whether the populace rises up to stop a war, but whether the populace doesn't care if you're kicked out for mishandling it. Stalin worried about it after Barbarossa, the Soviets worried about it during Afghanistan. Saddam, Hitler, Mussolini, you name it, they all faced internal political struggles of some sort during a losing war. And while public support for those factions wasn't critical, they did at least want some level of public passivity. 

So, you're wrong in writing off the public here - Putin *certainly* hasn't. Internal political dynamics shift rapidly in a losing war.

Submarine-launched ballistic missiles have served indispensably as part of most, if not all nuclear-armed states' deterrence structures for decades without fail, proving the feasibility of the concept without any significant compromises or challenges with performance and capabilities (at least, currently) on-par with their ground-based counterparts.

Given the seeming similarities between the two types, how practical (and affordable) would it be for a nation which already has an SLBM fleet to develop and deploy a ground-based ICBM force by producing a minimally-modified variant of the former that is suited for basing from land silos? If it were, then why hasn't such a plan been implemented for cost reduction and part-standardisation reasons?

TL;DR: Why hasn't a ground-based ICBM been developed from (or jointly developed as) an SLBM? Wouldn't the development and operational costs be significantly lower to develop a missile to do both?

Bonus question: Would the development and deployment of (or at least, the illusion of, even) a ground-based strategic deterrent that will form part of a triad (from a dyad that comprised SLBMs and ALBMs/cruise missiles/gravity bombs) be worth it as part of a tactic to force the opponent to ""waste"" warheads on additional counterforce targets, thus reducing harm to potential countervalue targets?",ade5634c3bdcd6ea7534b5bc98f685bf4bbdd3a3,True,False,,,,,0,1650293559,,0,{},i57qtyq,False,t3_u6enek,False,True,t3_u6enek,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6enek/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_18th/i57qtyq/,1650293576,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650264759.0,

Yes, at least to some extent.  Frankly, even cutting Russian oil/gas purchased in half will have a tremendous effect as Russia relies on these sales to run their kleptocracy.  

Oil is a commodity that can be sold elsewhere, although Russia will likely have to sell at a discount for some time because of the sanctions.

Natural gas is a commodity that is most economically transported via pipeline, so Russia will have a hard time recovering any gas sales lost to Europe.  They'll lack the funds to build new pipelines to export to other countries such as China and foreign investors are going to be ***very*** wary of funding any such projects.

France offers the way forward here.  They recently announced 12 new nuclear plants which will mean they are exporting clean energy in the future.

I'm all for renewables, but until we figure out major advances in ways to store energy and the costs to do so, nuclear needs to be utilized.  It is remarkably safe and emissions free.

In the meantime, Europe can focus on reducing consumption via efficiency improvements, more renewables, and even simple things such as adjusting thermostats a few degrees.",1a079e35a0d36322205b53d4db7c517b34f3488b,True,False,,,,,0,1650291736,,0,{},i57mj2x,False,t3_u6bgbg,False,True,t1_i57e3ls,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6bgbg/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_18_2022/i57mj2x/,1650291751,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650262936.0,

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Spreading out combat units too much dilutes combat power, it's why massing is a principle of war and why dispersing is generally considered a bad thing. However, modern ground combat units have increased lethality by way of newer technology so they're still massing combat power. And better comms is a bigger player in the ability to fight coordinated while dispersed, as well as great tactical and operational mobility, the more secure they can communicate and move faster the further away from each other they can be while still having the ability to project power and strength. 

These ideas behind the BTG operating independently was mostly hyped up capabilities tauted by western analysts trying to find strengths of the new Russian system. Realistically, the BTG have good firepower but not enough to go after anyone bigger. They're infantry dismount weak. Their comms aren't very good nor do they have the logistical tail to support themselves well at all. 

When it comes down to it the idea of using BTG is less about tactical independence or anything like that and more about better training in combined arms, and making the most out of a brigade being undermanned.

Historically, combined arms is usually done at the company and battalion level though brigades and divisions are the administrative hubs. So let's say there is a motor rifle brigade, it has on paper 1x tank battalion, 3x motor rifle battalions, 2x tube arty battalions, 1x MLRS battalion, 1x recon battalion, etc. Back at their bases, these units don't live together, don't regularly train together until they come together for exercises or combat, so lack familiarity with each other that becomes apparent when they try to function together. There is a good reason to keep them apart, they're from different branches, have different training requirements, need different ranges, have different supply systems, different maintenance requirements, etc. Combining them into combined arms battalions before they go into exercises/battle dramatically complicates housing, maintenance, training, etc, but makes them more cohesive and familiar so, technically, they should perform better in terms of actually performance. The US Army did the same thing by permanently mixing combined arms battalions. People have been talking about doing this for most of a century.

Another issue the Russians had was their brigades were never full strength. The above listed units is paper strength, not realistic. So to actually make real fighting units from the brigade they built BTGs from within, because BTGs are real. A lot of brigades only had one BTG for a while despite supposed to have two, with the third capable of being filled by reservists if they mobilize (a proxy cadre unit). That's actually what happened last year, in anticipation for Ukraine Putin authorized a small reservist activation and used it and a bunch of conscripts to fill up a bunch of brigades to activate more BTGs. That's where the big increase in number came from, brigades and divisions are working their asses off to create more BTGs.",cc36b0c6b42e18a571ec50cf37b4402aee859bc9,True,False,,,,,0,1650291495,,0,{},i57lyc2,False,t3_u5o70c,False,True,t1_i54wqrv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5o70c/getting_to_know_the_russian_battalion_tactical/i57lyc2/,1650291507,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650262695.0,

I think there are several reasons. One is long-term, the other is short-term.

Long-term:
Putin doesn't feel Russia can survive if it's not that much close to being the fuel monopolist: Ukraine recently discovered high reserves of oil and natural gas. ""Recently"" as in the off-shore oil reserves were discovered in 2013. Taking Crimea (and its' shorezone) in early 2014 effectively blocked Ukraine from developing the oil reserves in the Black Sea. In a similar manner a war, an occupation or a frozen conflict on Ukraine soil will prevent it from developing the natural gas reserves on the west of the country.

Short-term:
Russian economy is in downward trend, popularity and support is falling, the Russian internal mythos of being the greatest country in the world is conflicted with the everyday life the people are seeing. Short victorious wars can help with all of that. Ukraine seemed EASY: the expectation was an easy win with low-to-none resistance, hopefully close to the Crimea process in 2014 - it would have been amazing for Putin and putin's army in terms of popularity and support. And the war machine always pushes the economy forward (as long as you're winning and the war is not on your soil)",c82277cb46b629f060ab0c9a7a0a4c22cc77744f,True,False,,,,,0,1650289057,,0,{},i57gipz,False,t3_s7u7ha,False,True,t1_i2owq4w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/s7u7ha/why_are_things_between_russia_and_ukraine/i57gipz/,1650289072,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650260257.0,

That administration was extremely ineffectual, according to Karber plan A was “ don’t provoke the Russians, let us negotiate with them to back off”

It was why they just allowed them to walk over the Ukrainians, it was stupid like thinking “ oh the Russians will quake in their boots over our Luke warm sanctions and will cede to us”

Karber explained that their mentality even from direct speaking with some Russians is “ well we will take as much as we can then try to negotiate you remove the sanctions after”

Couple that with how many western nations like the Germans were trapped in delusion “ Putin verstehe” I mean they still pushed ahead with nordstream 2.... it was a disaster.


Karber explained the most effective sanctions weren’t against Russia but Ukraine as we blocked them from getting any lethal aid and in fact even blocked them from buying sophisticated weaponry like javelins for a long time.

This as intelligence knew Russia had invaded donbass with its regular army and Ukrainians had to fight against all odds, pulling off things like the “great raid” that managed to cause huge losses to the Russian airborne units stationed in Ukraine.

Meanwhile Ukrainians were being absolutely mauled by heavy weaponry in donbass and Russia sent its “ humanitarian convoys” of heavy shells, blasted them with thermobaric, shelled them with impunity from across the border.

This was all a disgrace, a big reason they got encircle din ilovaisk and debaltseve is they simply didn’t have the anti tank weapons to resist the several Russian BTGs of tanks that would roll in whenever the Ukrainians would have the upper hand and we didn’t even let them buy sophisticated weaponry.

It’s an embarrassment even when we have them counter battery radar we nerfed it for fear of “ provoking Russia” when they’d already invaded.


Finally we’ve abandoned all that nonsense which is so refreshing I’ve even seen credible reports they will receive reaper drones.

I hope to god that now covert training starts for all the NATO systems we think they will need, training tank crews for hand me down tanks, even creatively setting up operators for reaper drones to be used ASAP against the Russian second offensivr. I hope we are also training Ukrainians for hand me down or discounted older model jets like F-15 f16 or even a10 ( would hype them public support) so that we never say “ they need tanks and planes but we’d need to train them for months” we have to start now.


The whole situation of saying the Ukrainians can’t fight or would roll over fame from the west drinking its own kool aid, they’d fought for years and build up hundreds of thousands of veterans from troop rotations.

We simply had a complex political situation in the west and EU / America and things like German dependency complicated things and we will fully pretended they weren’t being invaded as we didn’t want to upset current situations.

More to the point, forces aside, they lack munitions to just line up the artillery tubes and pulverize the opposition, as such combat requires. See point three.

Point two. Russia has made little progress mostly because they haven’t started their offensive yet. It takes a lot of time to recover all the forces from the failed Kyiv,Sumy,Chernigov fronts and reorganize these forces into some form of unit cohesion, while bringing forward every unit that can be scraped together to replace losses and sufficient food,fuel and ammo to support such an effort.

Third point. Russia is likely to have one bight at the apple here. They have assembled a formidable force, but this is it, there are no reserves of equipment and munitions to restock for a second try. Ukraine’s goal is to survive the offensive, to bend and not break, until Russia exhausts itself.

Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is a force structure recapitalization effort to design and procure a family of rotary-wing platforms capable of operations in future highly contested envi­ronments. The Army’s FVL is the leading edge of an effort that has identified the need for a rotary-wing Family of Systems that can deliver five capability sets for joint use across the Services. Due to budgetary limitations and force modernization priorities, the Army is currently pursuing only two of these capability sets, but they still represent a significant effort for the Army, as they are the first new helicopters designed since the mid-1980s. As the Army considers candidates for these new helicopters, it is carefully considering both near-term and long-term challenges from adversaries, as well as the perennial aspect of affordability. 

In Living within One’s Means, authors Christopher Bassler, Matthew McCarton, Travis Sharp, and Josh Chang analyze past vertical lift acquisition programs, current acquisition trends, and new acquisition methods in the digital age to apply all three to the FVL effort. Drawing upon these analyses and the results of a CSBA workshop (held under the Chatham House rule), the authors find that while past attempts to enhance affordability have been unsuccessful, new digital approaches, such as the Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA), may hold costs down while diversifying opportunities for new technologies and subsystem solutions. The authors also discuss the risks of deferring or cutting new helicopter designs, both in the face of adversaries and the technological limitations of current rotary-wing designs.

The FVL effort may face roadblocks, but it also could be one of the first major programs to drive an open ecosystem of affordable designs. If the Army can live within well-estimated means, stick to its plan, and pace advancing threats, FVL could become one of the most successful defense acquisition programs of the 21st Century.

1. Does Ukraine have the ability to mount a strong counteroffensive to seize ground or would such an action leave them exposed and finally give Russia the opportunity they need?

2. Russia hasn’t seem to have made any progress, the war seems to be at a stalemate almost.  Seems static as of the last few weeks.  However Ukraine with all the supplies they are being given can keep this up indefinitely so long as their willpower holds up.  Can Russia? Is there a point or a timeline at which Russia can’t keep up anymore?

My general thought is that even if Russia reaches the point that they really cannot continue Putin will continue to feed troops into the meat grinder be causing loosing would be so politically devastating?

I realize very few people understand internal Russian politics, but if anyone here has a somewhat decent understanding is it fair to say withdrawal would be political suicide for Putin?

If Russia did reach the point where the war was unsustainable I could see Putin essentially withdrawing a bit to the East and ceasing offensive operations, not acknowledging that the war is over but basically just trying to hold what ground he can and pretend the war is ongoing, basically resuming the 2014-22 Crimea conflict but on a larger border, and with Ukraine probably prodding them more aggressively",097cd5c74e234f0c5b0eb07ba2921e045b501d9b,True,False,,,,,0,1650284388,,0,{},i577k8x,False,t3_u6bgbg,False,True,t3_u6bgbg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u6bgbg/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_18_2022/i577k8x/,1650284403,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650255588.0,

False, Ukraine cannot fight with western tactics as they do not have western military equipment nor capabilities. They do not have western tech aside from some infantry equipment.

The west and the US are almost guaranteed to be a bigger winner than China, depends on how the war goes.

Russian soft power in the region and middle east will also likely diminish, meaning that the US/NATO could also scale down capabilities there. NATO is being reinvigorated and expanded, European allies are taking a greater interest in their militaries and so on. nations in the pacific are also more interested in security guarantees.

However this will work out, US and NATO are likely to gain a what will become a significant ally in eastern Europe, and a new alliance, even if informal, between baltics, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and so on will be formed to deter Russia, freeing the US from obligations there.

&gt;On the flip side, Taiwan and Ukraine are so different that China can feel a little confidence that they can avoid putting their foot in the same bear trap Russia has.

If they are so different then how can China ""learn a lot""? The ability of China to learn specifics from the ongoing conflict is limited because of how different the situations will be.

&gt;Instead of a supply line that is just stepping over the border into Poland, Taiwan is going to be completely cut off from the world from any other form of resupply besides military convoy.

And, that's nothing new? China will have a significant issue supporting it's logistics there as well, compared to Russia in Ukraine. It's just different.

&gt; I suspect that the Ukrainian war will actually help prepare China for the invasion of Taiwan, rather than scare them away.

I still don't understand in which way would it prepare them?

I don't think that would be likely. Russia still has a significant interest in keeping Ukraine in it's sphere as a buffer and the US also has a significant interest in denying Russia a nuclear-powered ally. We know that nuclear weapons aren't an impediment to good relations with the US (see Israel, Pakistan etc...) or Russia (see India etc...) when other geopolitical objectives are concerned. 

&gt; it would have missed out on the post-Cold War peace dividend

For countries like Ukraine and Russia there was no peace dividend. The dissolution of the USSR left their economies in ruins. Ukraine's GDP fell by 60% and hyperinflation was at 10,000% in 1993. 

&gt;it would have reduced rather than increased the chance of getting conventional Western aid against any future Russian aggression.

That's also assuming that Russia would risk invading a nuclear armed state. I doubt they would due to the huge risk of nuclear retaliation. 

&gt;Do you want to be a perpetually poor and isolated but uninvaded country, or do you want to take your chances on developing into a modern economy and hopefully at the same time getting Western security backing?

That's a false dichotomy, there is nothing that says that you cannot be a prosperous nation while having nuclear weapons. North Korea wasn't isolated due to nuclear weapons, they were isolated due to the fact that they invaded South Korea, never made peace and still engage in aggression and threats against the US and South Korea to this day. The Western security backing is nice, but it's far from the ideal scenario. The Ukranian government would rather have nuclear weapons and security than no nuclear weapons and no security.

I just dont understand why everyone n reddit and in the western media seems to think that Ukraine is winning this war. Yes Russia underestimated the resolve of the Ukrainian people and administration which cost them dearly. This was an unforced error though. From the very beginning, the fight in the south and east of Ukraine was much more successful. To date Russians pushed up to Kershon in south western part of the country and managed to take the key strategic point of Izyium in the north eastern part. Now they are set to take over Mariupol. After they will do so they will have established a land bridge from Russia to Crimea and Kherson which will allow them to support a front to Odessa. It will also free up their army to do a pincer movement on the main Ukrainian army positioned in the DOnbas. As stated by Zelensky, this army is simply outgunned. Unlike around Kyiv, they are fighting in open terrain. This is where tanks excel. Since we in the west refuse to provide heavy weapon support it is really unclear to me how the Ukrainian army is supposed to withstand that. Should Russia be able to successfully complete a pincer on the Ukrainian army they can then push on to Kyiv with the full might of their army. They could also choose to take Odessa instead, land-locking Ukraine. Maybe I am too pessimistic here, but I honestly dont see any signs of Ukrainian succes and looking at the facts as they develop makes me think that it is actually Russia who is slowly achieving their objectives.

If the Russians take the area and as far as they are aware when they make the statement the Ukrainians have left the area or have been killed it has fallen, but until Ukraine can actually verify that information, they are going to deny it has. If there is still some resistance Ukraine does not want to say it has fallen and concede defeat until they are sure.

No power, no water, no MUX, no firefighting hardware.

You need to be ready to use a thermic lance on a boom to perforate the hull and insert a foam nozzle, like on an airport pumper truck, to deoxyenate the fire which may well be so hot that it slags /steel/, never mind aluminum, at 3,000\`\`\`\` F.  Nothing else will work.  Water will vaporize to steam, instantly.

And yet you should be trying because you are concerned with saving the adjacent two compartments, including oil and magazines.

We fight casualties poorly in the modern naval service.  Because we start at the wrong side of the hull and operate under the incorrect assumptions.

First you save the crew.  By shrinking the complement with automation of ships services so that you can stuff the utility complement into the thickest citadel you can manage in a sealed atmosphere condition.  As these folks should all be contract hire with low-training as combat capacity, they are useless to the combat evolution.  So it's best they just stay out of the way.

Sitting atop life pods rails which can be ejected, even at a serious list and protected from heat and combustion products.

Which will allow a more strategic approach to fire fighting.  

Another bunker should be for the combat crew who run navweaps and can, at need, hand off the residual command function to a separate drone control facility on another ship when they lose sensors or power.

You seal and evacuate (air from) spaces NOT inhabited by crew, where possible.  You put robots on overhead slide poles with onboard (rechargable)  reservoirs of water and foam or Halons which can, again, be injected through ports, straight into compartments without opening hatches.

But since there is going to be nothing worth saving from the damaged compartment, and since you will almost certainly lose seaway to any flooding, as the fleet \_must\_ leave you behind to generate separation from the pyre, you need to think about crew survival, first.

The best way to do so is to preposition them in the hardest protected space you can since they have no business being out there, 'fighting the casualty', when the ship is likely down as a warfighter and needs to stay that way to avoid further engagement.  You're talking cooks, janitors and electricians etc. here.  Not sailors.  Not sworn oath warriors. 

If your boats (or the ocean going tug which will hopefully be along shortly) can rig a cradle of canvas, resin impregnated, to seal any water line breaches before attaching to cleats or some other kind of high tension fitting on the sides of the hull to begin pumping operations, they should.  As the equivalent of a giant pressure bandage.

That weight of water is going to eventually destroy the ship's structural integrity or wreck it's buoyancy, either of which will lead to a flotation kill.

But only by being off the hull do you have any real hope of even being survivable enough to /attempt/ BDR.  And against a modern AShM, the amount which a DDG/FFG can do to recover combat capacity or self-nav is limited by the amount of volumetric damage done, internally, by the impact.

So keep the crew alive and ready to abandon until such time as the naval architects can say, go or tow.",d4c71b41a09f44513c9fc06b3bf4aa9429750695,True,False,,,,,0,1650256208,,0,{},i566qhp,False,t3_u4yhtf,False,True,t1_i4zy298,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4yhtf/lessons_not_learned_cruise_missile_attacks_on_uss/i566qhp/,1650256225,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650227408.0,

These roads could be lined with buried artillery shells that could be monitored with UAVs and triggered by cell phone calls. Having fought in Iraq and dealt with the threat of IEDs I am baffled why there hasn't been more evidence of their widespread use by Ukraine.

The biggest trouble with IEDs is that when you bury a few daisy chained artillery shells on the side of a road, the explosion isn't directed across the road but rather upwards. So unless you can find a way to bury the IEDs directly under the road or get sophisticated EFP IED's from Iran which are designed to direct the explosion across the road (like the Shia Iraqis in the south got later in the war), then IEDs have somewhat limited impact. Still, even dumb IEDs consisting purely of a bunch of daisy chained arty shells buried alongside an MSR can do a lot of damage.

I doubt the Russians have much EW technology for distrupting cell phone calls to the IEDs to detonate them, but even if they do it is easy to counter that by running a long wire from the IED to the cell phone some distance from the placement so the call won't be disrupted by the (probably non-existent) jamming equipment on the passing Russian convoy.",24deabf63248e820360d4c9942f3777b6f3a6e2d,True,False,,,,,0,1650255267,,0,{},i5656oy,False,t3_u5lm14,False,False,t1_i54zxs3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i5656oy/,1650255280,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650226467.0,

Well they actually do (even if the frontline combat situation is not posted on twitter daily or streamed live for the audience), its just not nearly as effective as many ""experts"" might presume. But why is it so?

Because the russians have serious problems with their fire planning and control. Even though they enjoy the superiority in terms of the number of guns in almost every AO, they can't use it well because they lack the ttp to guide their fire on the correct targets. They have vague doctrines, but little in terms of actual drilled methods and techniques and real (not on-paper) training of their personnel. This is even harder when they face a prepared defense in depth (literally everywhere), because even when they do manage to spot a single defense point and direct a barrage of fire in its direction, the best they can hope to accomplish is to suppress that single point, with a massive expense of ammunition. But even when they face a truly fortified line of resistance they struggle to hit it let alone disable it because the skill of their artillerymen is lacking. 

[Here's for example a picture of a single platoon position in the East that was shelled by 4th mech brigade of 2 AK (the so called lnr)](https://ic.pics.livejournal.com/kenigtiger/503961/850239/850239_800.jpg). And these are some of the better artillerymen on the russian side. Ironically, l\dnr cadre troops: artillerymen and tank crews - are much more capable than the best regular russian troops, based on what I can observe. This position was ultimately abandoned by the defending platoon with some casualties, but it was never truly destroyed by the artillery, just suppressed. In contrast, Ukrainian artillery is considerably better organized, controlled and directed (even though there are issues from battalion level and above) and is able to lay a much more accurate and timely fire, and it is a main bulwark against enemy assaults.",502d9a5b819616a97a8cf2ed82afd76aaf82a6a8,True,False,,,,,0,1650252822,,0,{},i560v3l,False,t3_u5lm14,False,True,t3_u5lm14,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5lm14/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_17_2022/i560v3l/,1650252839,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650224022.0,

One: China faces the combined might of the allied Asian powers, US, and probably a good chunk of NATO. Canada, Australia, and the UK would almost certainly be involved. France and Germany are possible-to-likely. In short, there isn’t enough room in the Taiwan Strait for the number of allied attack submarines that would be trawling for Chinese shipping.

Would the Chinese be able to do better in the face of a full onslaught by allied SEAD? Who knows. Probably not. The downside, of course, is that instead of flying across Germany to supply Taiwan, the Allies would be flying from staging points in Japan and the west Pacific, so both sides face some new and unique challenges.

The USN has had various mast-top and on-mount (Mk.38/.44/.46) optronics heads which are colloquially known as 'TIZ' and 'VIZ' for thermal and visual imaging systems, ever since the Iran Air shoot down.

Run through a common console in the AWO and SWO departments of the CIC and also available (on some ships) on the bridge.

Unfortunately, there is no integrated EWMS ala TERMA like there is on jets and helicopters.  SLQ-32 is it's own thing, with various bolt-on systems to expand jamming coverage for specific threats AIEWS is a long dead dream for total system integration.

There is some EMI assurance testing between active and passive sensors and jammers but nothing that acts as a multi-spectral combat management system which can reach across missions to provide alerts.

And that is a shame because EO actually changes less than RF in terms of new coatings or what have you, radically changing 'colors' of optical bandwidth spectrum.  If it's going to work, it almost always does so.  While RF is a lot more variable, depending on where your next cruise takes you.

On the best systems, you have a 360\`   staring system to provide CCD and a magnified imager on a gimbaled ball to investigate what the SAIRST is  recording, like the DAS-to-EOTS transition on the F-35.

It does not always work because fog and rain can effect propagation lines but it is generally so /vastly/ better than lookouts and the rest that it's not even worth the comparison.

Increasingly, it can also do SAA under conditions where low rate of change and high inertial lag makes safe sealane separation an issue, you don't see an aspect change until it's too late and even then you're talking to an aft lookout rather than properly LOOKING AT THE HAZARD, on video.  This is particularly gnarly when mission or rules deny the rotate and radiate option due to EMI or a nearby nellie who thinks you're looking for things you shouldn't be.

More than anything however (Japan, Korean freighter) it is just that humans are really poor watch keepers.  Automation and three separate combat watches, along with shift-captains can handle tacticals but for the daily grind they are just about worthless.

Especially given the quality of today's crews and the loads put on junior officers.  Boredom takes over, lack of understanding of position and rate with few qualified WOs to instruct and oversee makes a habit of mistakes and late-watch fatigue becomes a real issue as well.

To many people grew up with Star Trek thinking that there would be time to have a good conversation or ability to visually monitor multiple hazards/threats as a kind of tropeish command hierarchy but that is simply not how it works in real life.

You are alone on a scope, often as part of several other duties.  And where there is one, the threat develops \_really fast\_.  Because that's the observed vulnerability they are trying to exploit.  They are there because that is the momentary weakness.

To the point where it's 'button now or else' and if the computer is locked out of auto mode for fear of R2 shooting down the COD, you're really kinda SOL.  Unless you see it developing early and can do things to make sure they know, you know, and it's about to get wicked if they don't stop sea monkeying around.

There is no 'smoke on the horizon' moment before the first whoosh of a salvo coming in.  And the best you can hope for, present day, is a system which networks several tired/dumb/bored souls on multiple hulls with a loud enough 'Did you SEE that?!' as depth of sensor cross-look to at least give the Capital Center a chance.

Speaking of which, last I heard, there were two Krivaks and three Grigorovichs in the Black Sea Flotille.  While the Moskva died alone.  By itself that is just incredibly suspect.  You don't get involved with drones.  Your screen does.  You don't provide a discrete (Top Sail + Top Pair), your escort does.  You don't get your ride sunk from under you, 37nm out to seawards without SOME CLUE as to the inbound's bearing and range rate.  They get to play picket because they cost less, bluntly.

If there is justice in the world, heads will have rolled in VMF HQ for that mistake alone.

When you're talking about even a Soviet era ship with a supposed value of 750 million dollars (closer to 4.5 billion, i.e. DD-21 Zumwalt class in Western Money) the idea that there is \_any\_ debate or delay on ship status and casualty specifics from a twice per hour upload of key video samples and telemetry parameters is just ludicrous.

You have no carrier, so you have no organic AEW&amp;C so you need a HALE BAMS or at least frequent Satellite overhead.  Which should be simple, given the location.  Once you have the downlink for Sensor, having the uplink for ship monitoring should be shigs and tiggles.

We're talking basic 'if you want to insure this thing...' level stuff which have been on Western commercial hulls since the Exxon Valdez.

Something really stinks here and my automatic assumption is it involves us being nasty like this-

I'm not saying it's impossible that Russia makes further advances, but it really seems like the reinforcements from the north are replacing the losses in the south, not adding to their ability. The more time is passing, the worse the situation is getting for their ability to make advances. It's very unlikely that Russia will manage any major encirclement in the east and even less likely that they would hold onto that encirclement.

Furthermore, people are acting like Russia using chemical weapons is an 'I win' button, but I'm not convinced of that either.

I think it's apparent that Russia is having supply problems in the area, and artillery shells are some of the heaviest cargo to transport, especially when your army's only strength is massed artillery. 

Although Russia holds Izyum, I'm guessing they are hesitant to send guns over the river for fear that they will be destroyed, or that they will not be able to transport shells over the river. We've already seen UA SOF blow up a bridge near Izyum. So if all the Russian guns are stuck on the north side of the Donnets, that means the Russian advance probably won't have much luck extending beyond effective artillery range, which appears to be where Russia has stopped.

Less of an explanation for why Russia isn't using massed artillery in the north. If I had to guess, I would say that Russia is low on shells anyways and probably can't afford to repel UA counterattacks east of Kharkiv and hold their position south of Izyum at the same time.
