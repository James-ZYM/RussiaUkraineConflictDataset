TL;DR: Wars cost money and Russia’s spending about $1B/day. Russia’s GDP in 2021 was $1.7T and it’s forecasted to contract by ~10% in 2022 (maybe more depending on sanctions). The combined GDP of NATO members is over $40T. Each member is expected to contribute 2% of GDP toward NATO (which many don’t, but follow the math), which would give NATO $800B budget to play with. As a point of comparison - US spending during Vietnam was 8% GDP and during Reagan’s buildup in 1980s 6%. Russia’s $1B/day spending adds up to ~21% of their GDP. As long as “west” has the will to arm Ukraine, Russia cannot sustain this war long-term.

It’s something that can occur purely from the involuntary stimulation of the action of getting raped. There is a lot of homoerotic messing around in elite frontline units even though they are nearly 99% heterosexual and it’s kind of a mental conditioning. It’s very difficult to explain if you’ve not served at that level but it’s a way of proving that as the most elite soldiers you are immune to things like embarrassment, fear of what others think or say. It’s normal for guys to drink each other’s Piss, play with each other’s dicks, and much worse and it’s not because they are even slightly gay or bicurious it’s a way of saying we are so fucking hardened that we fear nothing and nothing phases us. The Bravo Two Zero SAS guy Andy McNabb describes being forced to lick human shit and other degrading stuff and it’s clear he felt no sense of embarrassment or shame.

I'm not denying that at all.

I do wonder if in the internet age, an age of ubiquitous smart phones, an age of ubiquitous expert commentators that a blanket prohibition is still as warranted now as it was 72 years ago when the Geneva Convention was signed.

Here is a 1991 paper from the head of international law at the red cross, noting that the changing media landscape of the 90s demonstrated how the geneva convention blanket prohibition should be reconsidered

https://international-review.icrc.org/sites/default/files/S0020860400080542a.pdf

that paper clearly doesn't go as far as allowing the video above, but it goes along way to distinguish insults, humiliations of prisoners along with dangers to their families from transmissions that do not insult or humiliate prisoners and do not create dangers all because of the changing 

And that was 1991.

&gt; noting however that the prohibition against insults and public curiosity
must be interpreted in the light of modern communications technology,

...

&gt; The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 requires prisoners of war to be
treated with humanity at all times (Article 13). In particular, prisoners of war
must be protected against insults and public curiosity. However, this provision
was agreed before the advent of television and contemporary communication
technology. It has been argued that the prohibition against insults and public
curiosity must be interpreted in the light of modern capabilities.

&gt; On the one hand, a newspaper photograph or television picture of a prisoner of war can be claimed to prove that he/she is alive, and to show his/her
standard of treatment. On the other hand, such publicity can humiliate the
prisoner of war, endanger his/her family and make his/her return to his/her
own State more difficult. Consequently the media must be prudent and
consider the consequences of their actions",eac371cd954a5e43890c16c9cacdc5fe93a21b8e,True,False,,,,,0,1650248947,,0,{},i55takd,False,t3_u5tvcx,False,True,t1_i55ltky,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u5tvcx/when_a_captured_russian_soldier_calls_his_mom_it/i55takd/,1650248959,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650220147.0
