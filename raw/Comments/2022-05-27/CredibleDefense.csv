[],False,,BertDeathStare,,,[],,,,text,t2_cjnd6,False,False,"Also commenting to say your comments are very interesting and hope to see more of your thoughts in the future. This is basically why I come to this sub, to learn from more knowledgeable people.

You said in other comments that people can ask questions. Could I ask some? If you prefer not to answer for any reason, don't worry about it.

1st question: unless I misinterpreted your comments, you think that the US and Japan (and possibly others like the Philippines and Australia) would get militarily involved to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, and that China is aware of this.

You also think that despite China's problems such as a low birth rate, China will continue to grow their economy and by extension their military. So assuming China continues to grow larger and more advanced economically and militarily, do you think the likelihood of US (and allied) military intervention will shrink over time, as the situation slowly turns more and more in China's favor? Or do you think a defense of Taiwan is sort of set in stone? I've seen people argue that the US should drop its strategic ambiguity for this reason and guarantee Taiwan protection ASAP, now that the odds are still against China (assuming it's US+JP+TW+PH+AU vs China). So in short, your opinion on *""time is on China's side""* regarding Taiwan?

&amp;nbsp;

2nd question: while there's much disagreement on whether the US military would defend Taiwan today or 20 years from now, I think it's fair to say that economic repercussions are a given, likely mainly coming from the West. We're seeing the international but mainly Western reactions to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including sanctions, Russian banks kicked from SWIFT, and [mass boycotts of Russia/Belarus by companies/orgs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_boycott_of_Russia_and_Belarus) Do you think China can expect the same reactions if they went to war over Taiwan, and what would that look like not just for China but also for the rest of the world?

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"Good points. And not just because of logistics difficulties and bureaucracy. We've talked a lot about how corruption seems to have had serious impacts on the Russian military's readiness, equipment, and supply distribution. Unfortunately, Ukraine has also historically suffered from corruption. Hopefully the long-running ATO/JFO already sifted out most of the chaff among the active duty professional forces, but with the expansion of the military to defend against a full-scale Russian invasion, there's also unfortunately new opportunities for supplies and equipment to fall off the back of the truck while in transport, and likely weaker oversight as competent and professional managers are spread thin trying to coordinate such a complex supply chain with so many different domestic, foreign and private suppliers. 

---

On that last note, and not at all relevant to the conversation, I'll be interested to see what systems Ukraine has built to manage their military's particularly complex supply chain. 

Military logistics is complicated enough for NATO forces with standardized equipment, well-established suppliers, and professional staff operating under mature policies and procedures.

Ukraine is dealing with all of the usual issues, while also having to coordinate distribution of an increasingly absurd diversity of incompatible weapons systems, delivered from a smorgasbord of foreign sources, each with their own unique policies and procedures, political sensitivities, delivery locations and schedules, transport methods and packaging, and varying levels of commitment to deliver resupply, replacement equipment, spare parts, and specialized or depot-level maintenance.

All that donated weaponry doesn't help much if a battalion equipped with Javelins gets a pallet of MILAN reloads, or a squad is issued 5.45x39mm ammo with their Zastava M70 rifles. Wikipedia's [list of equipment used by the Ukrainian Ground Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Ukrainian_Ground_Forces) is pulled straight from a particularly anxious quartermaster's nightmares. 

Since we've seen many reports of Ukrainian units being effective in combat with donated weaponry, and few reports of Ukrainian units being unable to use donated weaponry due to logistics mishaps, they must be doing *something* right. Given that Ukraine has a lot of talented software developers who have already made an impact with the custom mapping software that command posts use for plotting and integrating fire support - software that has gotten rave reviews from pretty much everyone - I wonder if they've made some breakthroughs in military logistics automation too.",3f1e0f7f9bb67962db81c43af6ce9080b320c51b,True,False,,,,,0,1653692014,,0,{},ia90gf7,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t1_ia8j9s0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia90gf7/,1653692031,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653663214.0,

There are many roles and positions within the military that are equivalent to an existing civilian position. What I mean is, there are people in charge of jobs that don’t require what we’d call “military” knowledge to do, in various sectors of logistics, IT and so on.

There has been some discussion whether or not the military should be more open to hiring civilians, (I don’t know what their legal status would be, but the distinction would be people who had not previously been in the military) to fill these roles.

To a certain extent because of contractors and consultants, civilians have a significant role in the function of the armed forces, but the idea here would be to do something like hire the former CEO of FedEx to be in charge of logistics for the army, and actually give that person authority within the structure of the armed forces.

The argument goes that companies hire proven top level leadership from outside their organization all the time, whereas the military has no other option than internal promotion.

One of the chief arguments against such a scheme is the belief that they would be resented, and no one would follow their orders because that person is an outsider who didn’t “put in the time” that they did, and suffer through basic training, combat deployments etc.

Ultimately I don’t see any army ever actually doing this, but I do think that they are correct in that there are totally people who could be greatly beneficial to the function of the army, but would never have made good soldiers.",2324fc70b8613442be586560ec7a7640c118c037,True,False,,,,,0,1653690096,,0,{},ia8wkq0,False,t3_uyxyp1,False,True,t1_ia8akcf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyxyp1/leadership_and_military_effectiveness_this/ia8wkq0/,1653690114,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653661296.0,

We also know that some people are inspired by challenges to expand their skillsets, and that still others will allow complacency to atrophy their abilities.

Analysis of leadership performance is such a complex topic that I actually doubt the ability of most organizations to assess it beyond the most obvious indicators. I remember reading a paper, which was mocked and ridiculed for the most part, that suggested that we are so hopeless at using any kind of logical system to promote people that we may as well embrace it and use a system that involved random promotion (or perhaps random within some parameters, e.g. they have to meet a minimum qualification, and then of the candidates the final selection is random).

[],False,,Tidorith,,,[],,,,text,t2_9d5fh,False,False,"&gt;But this has some interesting consecuences. Let's do a thought experiment as Putin who has just realized he has been given false information by those under him. Do you conclude that this is:

&gt;A. A direct outcome of the corrupt regime you has created yourself.

&gt;B: A deliberate plot that inplicates much if the millitary and inteligence high command that is attempting to sabotage your hold on power by starting an unwinnable war.

I think it's entirely possible that Putin is quite a lot smarter than he's been given credit since the war began. He may just be encountering the problem that intelligence isn't magic. 

We're talking about the phenomenon that, in an authoritarian state, it can be hard to make sure people give you bad news. I'd draw an analogy between that phenomenon like any kind of cognitive bias that's well studied in psychology. It is well known that with most cognitive biases, conscious awareness of that bias is not sufficient to eliminate the bias. Even a concerted effort to which you devote a significant amount of attention will likely not eliminate the bias in many cases. The other thing that's important here is that it's very hard to measure yourself and see to what extent any given bias is affecting you.

I think Putin knows about this phenomenon. I think it actively took steps to counteract it. I think he even knew that he was not entirely successful in this and that there were problems his country had he wasn't getting good information on. The problem he encountered is not some binary ""am I getting good information"", it's one of magnitude, and estimation of that magnitude. The information he was getting was much worse than he thought it was, and his degree of confidence in his own estimation its accuracy was far too high.

It's hard to measure your own cognitive bias or how good the information you're getting is, but sometimes you can test it, and the first phase of the war has done this. Putin will now have a very good idea of the magnitude of the initial problem, allowing him to re-calibrate. I don't think he's stupid enough to think that, now that the information he's getting is better, than the information he's now receiving is entirely absent that bias. But he's now alerted and will be more carefully measuring the information against reality - which is much easier now that you have the military strength of your deployment being tested and providing feedback every day.

All that is to say, the qualitative problem likely remains, but quantitatively it will be much reduced. His confidence in his own estimation is likely still to high, but I say that mainly because almost everyone's confidence in almost everything they believe is too high by default.",f21ee2b85823f2719784e9be863d3999a254cf4e,True,False,,,,,0,1653687905,,0,{},ia8s1ly,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t1_ia6zeqb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia8s1ly/,1653687918,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653659105.0,

There's a huge amount of space in between those two options - but talking about a no-fly zone basically limits the scope to just the first option and maybe a little bit beyond it.

The problem with the use of the term against Russia is that there isn't an obvious way that the US could choose for the scope to remain that small - Russia has the power to escalate all the way up the chain.

My level of knowledge is learned everything I know about modern warfare since Feb 24, and had to google half of your acronyms, but I assume that your job is to err on the side of overestimating the adversary.  What are the chances that you are overestimating Chinese capabilities in the same way that it seems like professional analysts overestimated Russia?  (My guess would be very small since it seems like China has a lot of newly developed tech vs the obsolete equipment seen in the Russian Army, and also they are innovating in terms of doctrine, data collection, and networking of forces.)

Will it even be possible to keep up with China militarily?  Seems like they have a lot of advantages.  Cheaper manufacturing means that, at equivalent tech levels, it will be hard to match them in volume of fires.  Lower wages mean that a higher percentage of their spending can go to equipment and tech development.  And their GDP is projected to pass ours around 2030.  So each dollar they spend will go further, and they can spend more of them for an equivalent % of GDP.   The tech advantage that I thought the US had sounds like it's not actually there.

Seems like the US has an advantage in access to orbit, though.  Would developing space dominance be enough to counter China's advantage on the ground / ocean?  Can we develop anti-missile tech that would negate China's advantage in volume of fires?  I feel like the US would definitely have the capability to match China in force networking and data collection and AI.  Is that being done?

Like I continued to say, I personally think the US is repressive and totalitarian due to various factors (say prison population, police enforcement(both in the amount of innocent they kill, and also violent crackdowns), CIA etc.).

But sure, you can have the opinion the US isn't (and we likely aren't gonna change each others opinions on this point).

&gt;The US tries to improve. It also has a foreign policy. They both happen at the same time regardless of preferences. 

I see very little action and efforts to improve, at the same time I see the US being very hypocritical when it calls out other states, which btw, might not be the case if the US could fix itself.

&gt;People wish for all these things but disagree about how to achieve them. They are debated openly and vigorously in the US.

So like I what I was trying to say earlier, you acknowledge that the US is mostly just all talk no action?

And if you wanna try and throw the conversation back to China, talk about chinese policies are OK on Chinese internet (yes, things get censored if they 'go over the line', which means talking bad about the party/Central government).

Famously when the CPC was celebrating their victory in eliminating absolute poverty, many internet complaints, and just complaints in general, basically forced the party (I think it was vice president?), to come out and admit it was only absolute poverty that was eradicated, and that there was still poverty to battle and lessen.

Another would be the many complaints about air quality from around late 2000s to early 2010s, yes you could say it took the CPC quite a while to actually come out and admit it, but we have in fact seen measurable strides in the improvement of air quality (many testimonials and also just plain old data if you compare various cities now in 2022 versus back in say 2008).

Lesser known, is how the common people are able to give feedback on newly implemented local policies and old, which has resulted in policies being reversed/stopped (btw the 'famous' social credit system is one, or well some smaller variants were tested in some smaller towns/cities, and they were then stopped due to negative feedback).

TLDR: US most all talk no action and in China there is SOME talk and action (can be slow).

Also maybe it would be in the interest of the US to spend money and resources on actually improving their country (like infrastructure, the BBB or B3W promises that, but they are 100% not enough, just search bridges that need repairs in US).",fc6ddff78a5d8620f5b853478f77a5ff718610c1,True,False,,,,,0,1653686171,,0,{},ia8ofg6,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia8m36r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia8ofg6/,1653686182,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653657371.0,

For years now, they've been dealing with the war in Donbas, where the Russians have been attacking Ukraine while insisting that they aren't attacking Ukraine and *constantly* engaging in disingenuous negotiations. There have been *literally dozens* of ceasefire agreements in the Donbas prior to this invasion. Ceasefire agreement, then Russians/Russian separatists launch small attacks, Deny the attacks happened, Ukraine counter attacks, Russians say Ukraine broke the ceasefire, continue.

Now, was Ukraine the one to break the ceasefire a few times? Maybe, but we're talking about the Ukrainian perspective here. From the Ukrainian perspective they didn't, and it doesn't matter cause they're still the ones being invaded.

If there's a ceasefire in this war, there's *no* reason to believe it will be any more genuine or lasting than the last several dozen. People have been saying they'll try again in five years, but there's no guarantee it would stop the war for even a minute. They'd probably stay where they are, continue shooting rockets and artillery, deny that they're doing it, then say the ceasefire is void once Ukraine counterattacks.

This war really shows that it's likely that the Russian military is *so* disorganized that they possibly actually didn't know they were breaking the ceasefires, they just don't have clear control over their forces. But if they're unintentionally unable to keep their agreement, then there's still no point in negotiating.

That's really why Ukraine is going to keep fighting and not negotiate, because negotiation just means more war at this point. Not even a break in the war. Honestly, even if Ukraine pushes Russia 100% out and Russia agrees to a peace deal, they'll probably keep shooting rockets at Ukraine forever if Ukraine tries to be neutral. Becoming a Russian puppet state is the only way Russia will stop attacking, and that just means Ukrainians would revolt.

That is also exacerbated by the modern ""Up or Out"" promotion system for officers especially that forces them to strive to follow a rather rigid and bureaucratic ""ladder of success"" model to gain further promotions in order to remain within the organization for a career.

China has this unusual mix of capitalist development that enables the dramatic and explosive growth they have seen the previous few decades (something the strictly state controlled USSR was not able to do after the Stalin period ended), while also having tight state direction by the Communist Party that enables long term, broad economic foresight and planning on a way that the West cannot do effectively. Their total political dominance also means they don't have to worry about the inconsistency and shifting priorities of a democratic society.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/world/middleeast/iran-drone-attack.html?referringSource=articleShare

By Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman

A drone strike this week targeted a highly sensitive military site outside Tehran where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology, according to three Iranians with knowledge of the attack and to a U.S. official.

The strike on Wednesday evening hit the site of the Parchin military complex, about 37 miles southeast of the capital, with quadcopter suicide drones, according to the Iranian sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The drones exploded into a building used by the Ministry of Defense for research on drone development, killing a young engineer who worked at the ministry and injuring another person, they said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack fit a pattern of past Israeli strikes on Iran and Lebanon in a covert campaign of hostility that has been going on for years. A statement from Iran’s Ministry of Defense indicated that it viewed this as an attack, not an accident.

Israeli officials refused to comment. A U.S. official confirmed that suicide drones had attacked Parchin but did not say who was behind it or offer any further details.

On Sunday, just a few days before the strike on Parchin, a colonel in the Revolutionary Guards was gunned down in Tehran, and Israel told the United States that it was behind his killing, according to one intelligence official. The Israelis intended it as a warning to Iran to stop targeting Israeli citizens abroad, the official said.

Israel and Iran are increasingly pushing the boundaries in their long-running clandestine war, and the targeting of a drone research facility at Parchin follows a pattern of Israel trying to counter Iran’s growing drone capabilities.

In recent years, Iran has steadily advanced in its design and production of drones and transfer of drone technology and parts to proxy militias across the Middle East. Iranian drones have been deployed in numerous attacks against Israel, as well as in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and, last October, a U.S. base in Syria, according to intelligence officials.

Israel considers the use of drones by its enemies, especially Iran, as a major threat to its security because drones can evade Israel’s advanced antimissile systems like the Iron Dome. A senior Israeli military official said the country was investing significant resources to locate and destroy enemy drones.

In early February, Israel sent six quadcopter drones containing explosives into a facility near the city of Kermanshah that was Iran’s main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones, according to a senior intelligence official briefed on the operation.

That Israeli attack destroyed dozens of Iran’s drones. Iran retaliated by firing ballistic missiles at a housing complex in northern Iraq that it said had been used by Israeli agents to plot attacks against Iran.

In June 2021, another attack using a quadcopter drone — which explodes on impact — was also launched from within the country. It struck the Iran Centrifuge Technology Company, or TESA, in the city of Karaj. TESA is one of Iran’s main manufacturing centers for the production of the advanced centrifuges used at the country’s two nuclear facilities, Natanz and Fardow.

In the face of longstanding suspicions that its nuclear program is aimed at producing weapons, Iran has insisted it is for peaceful purposes only. The United Nations’ watchdog has said it has not found proof that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.

The drone attack on Wednesday was launched from inside Iran, not far from the Parchin military base, according to the Iranian sources with knowledge of the attack. Quadcopter drones have a short flight range, and Parchin is a long way from Iran’s borders.

This would not be the first time that Israel had used operatives inside Iran to carry out attacks.

A statement by Iran’s Ministry of Defense on Thursday used the word “incident” instead of “accident” to describe what happened at Parchin and called the engineer who died a “martyr,” a clear indication that his death was viewed as a result of an enemy action. The statement said one of the research units of the Defense Ministry in the Parchin area was hit.

Several well-known social media accounts affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, including that of the military analyst Hossein Dalirian, also posted that the engineer was a “martyr.”

The senior editor of the conservative Iranian news site Tabnnak, Mostafa Najafi, said in a Twitter post on Thursday that he later deleted: “Israel attacked a ministry of defense facility with a few suicide quadcopter drones.”

The military facility at Parchin has for years attracted international scrutiny.

In 2011, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or I.A.E.A., said that some countries were suspicious that Iran had experimented with developing nuclear weapons at Parchin. The agency’s inspectors gained access to the site in 2015.

Photographs that Israeli officials said were stolen from Iran’s nuclear archive in 2018 appear to show a giant metal chamber in a building at the Parchin military site that was built to conduct high-explosive experiments, needed for the assembly of a nuclear warhead.

How did they so severely underestimate the Ukrainian will to fight? - Many factors, including wrong estimation of Ukrainian peoples' moods and state of our military. 

  
How did they underestimate their logistics challenges? - I think just didn't care enough. Almost all wars that involved us, we had poor logistics due to Russia's size and climate.  
  
Why did they bring such a small force? Typically attacker wants a 3-1 advantage. The USA avoids needing this advantage by achieving absolute air superiority.  
  
Did the Russians anticipate the Ukrainians having the level of Western support they've received? Both in arms transfers, and intel/command and control? - because we wouldn't like to be mobilized to go to war somewhere. But that might turn into a profit when Ukrainian army will be tired and worn out, and we still have a lot of reserves.   
  
What are the Russian goals now, and why do they think they've modified their strategy in a sufficient way to achieve them? Is mobilization off the table? - mobilization is off the table at least for today. The goals are as before - don't lose Ukraine from our influence area, economically and politically, and do something about nazi supporters there. I suppose Ukrainians really have that problem, even on Zelensky's 9th May congratualtions on Instagram a soldier with Nazi symbol was depicted.   
  
It's been a real wakeup call for me seeing the Russian armed forces perform so poorly. I did not expect the outcome the Ukrainians have achieved so far. - because we don't use a tactic of burned ground as say America did in Iraq. We don't massively bomb cities, even pictures of Mariupol, which suffered most, are mostly from same 1-2 city areas.

No they don't. Can they go to Kyiv? They can't even close the M03 highway in the Severodonetsk salient. 

&gt;they have the time, freedom and equipment resources to do so.

Absolutely not. They have no resources to rebuild from their current losses let alone expand, which is what they need to do. 

Strategically, far too much of their total ground forces are committed to Ukraine, about 60-75%. That means entire regions of their border are nearly entirely bare of troops, which means to protect against even Mongolia invading means they NEED to use nukes as they have nothing else. 

Operationally inside Ukraine they're most highly massed in the Donbas launching what is essentially a smallish corps sized offensive with two smaller fixing/holding attacks happening elsewhere in brigade strength. To put that in perspective, during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the US forces alone used to liberate Kuwait amounted to 3x very large corps. 

&gt;also unfortunately does not have movement flexibility in the donbas as dug in defensive positions do not allow for this. 

This is very true. During positional warfare in the tight confines of a salient that small with so many Russian forces in the area, options are limited and mobility isn't really possible. 

&gt;All russia has to do is continually strike along the dnipro, destroying roads and bridges and the whole east front becomes untenable. 

Temporarily, yes. Ukraine can ferry it and run up pontoon bridges to move forces across. That'll limit what they can move but it won't stop it.

&gt;If russia where to advance from kherson, North along the western side of the Dnipro River as the east collapses destroying roads and bridges and the whole east front becomes untenable. 

You're talking about a 205 mile offensive just to follow the Western bank of the Dnieper to reach Dnipro. Then one UAF counterattack that cuts their paper thin thrust cuts them off and they all surrender. 

To make that work they have to fight north all the way to Kyiv, 400 miles away, take about a dozen towns and cities, while pushing out westwards to protect their flank from any possibility of a counterattack. At a guess that requires about 500 BTGs. 

But there obviously aren't that many BTGs there, they achieved success in Donbas by massing much of what's left of their combat effective power to make the limited encirclement possible in the Severodonetsk salient. They can't also mass in Kherson even to make it as far as Dnipro, itself a spectacular operational victory, without shifting forces from elsewhere, which weakens those sectors. What they do have in Kherson are not really thinking of offensives, they're working on digging in to consolidate what they have to stop from losing it in counteroffensives. 

Same with much of the southern front on the Land Bridge, it's mostly quiet because they're digging a triple defensive line to stop it from being cut.",c94b18d2652c01cbdfdebdba16c45604e7cf3ed0,True,False,,,,,0,1653674396,,0,{},ia7yagh,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t1_ia7605y,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia7yagh/,1653674408,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653645596.0,

Now that is what you call a fact by providing evidence and not some fiction 'We shot down an F16 and don't you dare ask us for proof'. The only other fact we know is that the Indian SPICE bombs exploded in open fields inside Pakistan. The pilots failed to calculate the proper trajectory and elevation, but please keep making excuses.

Right! maybe you lost the other wars on purpose too.

Why does a Russian unit on the Kherson-Mykolaiv-Odessa axis need different markings than one on the Kyiv axis? And crazier, why did Russian units on the Sumy-Eastern Kyiv axis have different markings than units west of the Dnieper heading to Kyiv? 

My own pet theories are: 

- Units involved in an operational encirclement that perform a link up with another Russian unit with different axis marking symbols would know immediately that an encirclement was completed. But they still need to talk to each other to find out which exact units, who is behind and to the flanks, start coordinating for further missions, etc

- Different markings for drones, other ISR aircraft, or even media footage on internet or TV to report back to higher HQ in Moscow about ground unit front line trace without needing to communicate by radio. But this isn't 1980, Russians are allowed to use their radios now to report their positions, encouraged to especially since recon strike complex can't work if units don't know where each other are located.

- One military district command in charge of its own front did it first with their own symbol and then other MD and CAA and even specific unit types airborne prima donnas) copied with their own symbols to be unique, getting away with it since there was no single theater commander for the invasion until after a month into it, meaning there was no individual outside the MOD who could or would make the decision and give the order to do the simple thing and everyone standardize and just use a Z

1) Russia has no ability to produce tanks currently. As far as I know, tank production has been halted since early March due to lack of chips. Similarly, I believe most AFVs are similar for Russia. Furthermore, in seems generally agreed upon that tank reserves are misleading, since they have been kept outside, with dubious amounts of maintenance, at the very least. They possibly have also have had parts taken from them. Given that we have seen Russia at least moving it's T-62s, indicates that their tank capability is taking a large hit.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine are hurting for ""dumb"" artillery shells, which are cheap and presumably something that both Russia and Ukraine have ample supply of. ""smart"" shells are a different story, and Russia likely lacks the ability to manufacture these without western chips, and Ukraine has no ability at all, but is getting supplied these by the west. The same is basically true of drone production for both.

This leaves small arms production, which is a real gap, but given Ukraine seemingly hasn't been asking for it specifically, I can't really imagine it is that much of an issue.

The big advantage Russia has right now is  
a) The actual deployed force, which is certainly better equipped than the Ukrainian deployed force, particularly in terms of artillery and aircraft

b) The raw manufacturing ability to construct parts for maintenance

The first will eventually tilt towards Ukraine with attrition (excluding artillery and aircraft), given continuing western aid to Ukraine and Russian sanctions. The second's utility is ambiguous given Russian's brain drain, and the difficulty of repairing near the front lines.

2) Manpower

Russia seems unlikely to mobilize, and mobilization will take several weeks to have any real effect. Conscripts need to be trained and actually outfitted, and will mostly be relegated to basic infantry tasks, given the AFV force already seems pretty tapped.   And if the separatists are any indication, they will likely be equipped with Mosin Nagants. This can free up the Russian forces operating in different areas of Russia, but this still  isn't that much of a swing in firepower. And lightly trained, poorly equipped, and unmotivated infantry tend not fair well in wars of attrition.

This is all adding to the fact that part of the reason this entire war was started was for Putin to raise his approval, and mass conscription is an easy way to lose that.

3) Miscellaneous factors

Kherson is vital for Russia to control because of the Crimean water supply, so those troops really can't be moved. Their current forces are already highly concentrated in the Dombass, and they are doing as much as they can with that, which is what is getting them their current level of success.",2e4523e7c42d1f74ae1b965dd5f5e0c4d160356b,True,False,,,,,0,1653671373,,0,{},ia7r3ze,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t1_ia7hqa0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia7r3ze/,1653671391,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653642573.0,

Anyways, besides the Western nations, basically the rest of the world, including Muslim nations, doesn't believe that shit (quite a lot of normal people might believe, but that is an extent for the control/coverage due to western media penetration).

&gt;Your entire argument has been ""well the US sucks too!"" Which while true in many regards it does nothing to advance your own position.

Also my argument has been to not take whatever the US says (western media) to be a matter of fact. They are the accuser, they need to provide hard evidence.

And well, we have seen them lie many times, and the US has bombed and killed million+ Muslims, and now they want to help Muslims in China (geopolitical rival btw, they have motive to undermine and smear their rival like a company against their competitors).

And before you throw the recent accusations that has appeared in the news at me. I already seen various points about those accusations that throws doubt about their validity.

[],False,,wrosecrans,,,[],,,,text,t2_a99kk,False,False,"&gt; It is only smart for russia to use defeat in detail. The front is huge, they have the time, freedom and equipment resources to do so.

Time seems unclear.  The economic situation in Russia will only get worse as sanctions are increased and stockpiles of things dwindle.  Every widow or grieving mother is one more potential member of the political opposition.  There seems to be relatively high support for the war in Russia, but there are certainly some cracks showing, and it will get worse as the situation in Russia gets worse.

Likewise, equipment.  Russia is pulling out tanks from the 1960's at this point.  They aren't in particularly good shape.  They've used really significant amounts of missiles and guided bombs.  Meanwhile, Ukraine is getting a steady stream of equipment from the West.  Russia can only resupply with new stuff it buys from China.  Russia isn't building new tanks right now.  So, it's all down to what China will sell Russia, and what Russia can afford from China as sanctions effect the economy.  That's not a good story for Russian equipment advantage, especially in the context of asserting that Russia also has a long term time advantage.

IMO, Ukraine basically has the same time advantage that Afghanistan had against the US.  It doesn't really matter if the regular military is ultimately defeated.  (And the regular military is obviously doing a lot better against Russia than the Afghan military did against the US in 2001.)  The people don't want to be conquered by an invader.  Ultimately, there will still be some sort of partisan resistance 20 years from now if Russia manages to stay in it that long.  Even if the partisans run out of bullets, they'll throw rocks.  They'll use their bare hands.  There simply is no situation where Russia completely outlasts Ukrainian resistance unless they kill every last Ukrainian.  If it takes 200 years, there will still be some sort of resistance to Russian occupation.  Or 2000 years.  Sooner or later, Russia is going to re-evaluate that forever occupation of ""The Ukraine region of the Russian Federation"" and Ukraine will be independent again.",c49a5c937d5718aae44450d27c29909a2e079035,True,False,,,,,0,1653669084,,0,{},ia7liwh,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t1_ia7605y,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia7liwh/,1653669095,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653640284.0,

I would argue that that's far from a certain outcome, but even assuming it were, would it be worth a heightened risk of direct conflict and a potential nuclear escalation?

&gt;Because it maximises the options for coercion for NATO against its enemy. NATO doesn't owe Russia anything.

I didn't argue that it did.  It also has no obligation to ""coerce"" Russia, so I'm not sure that I understand why an increased number of opportunities to do so is really an advantage.

&gt;My point was the Great Powers don't have things they want handed to them out of charity, they take it. That's what defines them. Russia is either a Great Power and will create the reality it wants, or it will fail in its attempt and thus will no longer be considered one.

To answer your question, not really. If war means Russia is weaker politically, economically and militarily and also isolated from Europe that is now dominated by the US then no, peace is not in Americas interests.

&gt;Why pursue a course of action that forces Russia to either live with NATO on its borders 

Because it maximises the options for coercion for NATO against its enemy. NATO doesn't owe Russia anything.

&gt;or use violence to create a buffer state?

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"I read the article as this subject is near and dear to me as I believe the modern US military doesn't relieve enough for actual poor performance, especially in relation to combat performance. I also read and very much enjoyed Thomas Ricks' book The Generals, which this article has sourced from quite a lot. But I think there are a few flaws not only with what was presented in the article but also with Ricks' theories too.

First, the article:

&gt;The findings also indicate that interpersonal networks
did not prevent the American military from replacing underperforming generals

This is false. 

In fact, numerous senior US officers whose poor performance was proven historically beyond a simplistic flawed modeling concept were saved because of patronage by a senior officer or even politician based on previous networks and interpersonal bonding.

For instance, everyone knows that firing Fredendall after Kasserine for a host of legitimate reasons and Patton took over to whip II Corps into shape for victory, despite most of that being a simplistic myth. But Kasserine was a failure largely because Fredendall's corps had been purposely broken up,  dispersed, and overextended by orders of his superiors, Eisenhower (AFHQ) and Anderson (British First Army), who also were responsible for the absolutely terrible intelligence estimation that the Germans would not attack there despite numerous indications they would (Ike would sack his G2 over that failure). Despite their failings, neither Ike nor Anderson were relieved. Why? Both had patrons looking out for them, protecting them. I am a big supporter of Ike but he made quite a few errors that, depending on the mood, could have been used as grounds for firing him. I'm glad his career wasn't cut short over Kasserine, but he was quite lucky it wasn't, nearly entirely due to his interpersonal relationships with superiors who had his back.

Another great example of protected officers are those who themselves were responsible for more reliefs than any other command in US Army history, US First Army in the ETO, Bradley and Hodges, the textbook definition of hypocrites. 

Since Normandy, First Army led by what was essentially a reign of terror, a risk averse command that regularly gave vague and confusing and often contradicting orders and then threatened and relieved commanders at the slightest whim for ""failing"" them, while making many outright stupid tactical and operational decisions (three corps abreast grinding battle of Hedgerows, gave direct order to not close the Falaise pocket in time, piecemeal Huertgen offensive as if they were purposely trying to destroy their best divisions, Ardenne, bloody counterattacks afterwards). To say the First Army was toxic is to understate it. Both Bradley and Hodges both had good reason to themselves be relieved for cause during the war, let's just focus on the Ardenne offensive.  

Bradley himself was responsible for the intelligence failure that the Germans wouldn't attack in the Ardenne, it was his call to ignore the evidence they did have, to disregard junior G2 that they were going to be attacked, to rely too much on Ultra, etc. He was a key figure ensuring VIII Corps had a sector so large individual divisions were defending up to 30 miles frontages. He's the one who refused to respond to the attack when it started and wanted to ignore it (Ike overruled him and ended up saving the day). Afterwards Bradley refused to move his army group HQ to an area better suited to control units defending the northern part of the Bulge after Ike asked him to, citing that it would cause panic, which was why most of his army group was given to Monty. He also refused to visit subordinate leaders in person, preferring to speak to them on the phone (something he automatically relieved junior commanders for in Normandy). Those choices actually did trigger him to be unofficially relieved, 12th Army Group went from commanding three field armies to only one, Patton's (who didn't need an army group HQ just to supervise him when he was saving their asses). Bradley got his other field armies back over the next two months, bitched about the decision to remove him from their chain of command, took responsibility for the intelligence failure leading to that near disaster, and faced zero repercussions. Why? He was friends with Ike and was the protege of George Marshall.

Likewise, Hodges, whose plodering ways, stupidity, and poor leadership were already well known before the Ardenne offensive (he and Bradley were 100% guilty of the Huertgen Forest debacle). He too made many major errors when the Ardenne offensive started. Such as confusing it for a small and localizing spoiling attack and not a two panzer army attack, leading him to give orders for V Corps to continue an attack they were just starting who luckily chose to disobey his order and start planning a defense and retreat. Worse, he suffered what many described as a mental breakdown, explained away officially as a very debilitating bad head cold, that had him sleeping or catatonic during most of the first and second day and leaving him confused a week after while his toxic, tyrannical, and incompetent chief of staff gave bad orders in his name (not his job). When Monty saw him in person (which should have been Bradley's job), Monty recommended to Ike that Hodges be relieved for cause, which in every conceivable understanding of how that works and why, he should have been. But nope, Bradley saved him. And since Bradley was Marshall's protege and was the US senior field commander a darling of the American press up until then (to include the ""Soldier's General"" nonsense) they had to stomach it and keep Hodges in command. 

Meanwhile, in the ETO the US Army Third Army, Fifth Army, and Ninth Army all had better command climates than First Army, all were more successful (with Simpson being rated routinely as the best American field army commander of the war), and all went out of their way to not relieve commanders, to mentor them, to give second chances, etc. 

This comes back up Ricks' book, which heavily uses First Army and 12th Army Group as a positive lesson about the need to relieve while offsetting their decisions with the positive performance of the US Army in the ETO (similar to the +1/0/-1 model used in this article that is far too simplistic a metric). But what Ricks missed (and I did too until I spent a year reading the green books and nearly every other big name author about the US Army in WW2) was that once one gets into the nitty gritty of the history, the reality was those units did well more in spite of the toxic command climate and troublesome leadership they were stuck, than because of it. . 

That is not to say reliefs can't be positive. A poor performer in any organization needs to go to better the organization and leaders carry great responsibility and authority so their poor performance has exponential implications. And even someone who might be otherwise competent who for whatever reason has lost the trust and confidence of superiors and subordinates alike, they must go too. But going overboard can be just as bad as not doing it. There has to be a balance and that balance probably can't be measured but is just known by seeing the internal functioning and realizing it's a healthy and efficient organization that not only gets results but runs smoothly.",6b02aee7dc4799b35ab7eaf0d24275f2b8b5a245,True,False,,,,,0,1653668011,,0,{},ia7ivsf,False,t3_uyxyp1,False,True,t3_uyxyp1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyxyp1/leadership_and_military_effectiveness_this/ia7ivsf/,1653668029,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653639211.0,

My definition of freedom of movement for russia mainly comes from its ability to move free of Ukrainian artillery and airforce. Also it has the choice to move a BTG into russia and it to appear anywhere on the russian or Belarusian boarder without damage. 

Russians equipment reserves are large, much larger than ukraines. It also has a much larger industrial capacity to replace losses. I think this is well reported and accepted. 

Time is on there side because Russians ability to replace losses vastly out paces ukraines. Nato supplies will fill gaps and could negate this. However logistical and training issues with lots of equipment supplies could hamper ukraine. I think russia is banking on its ability to withstand sanctions longer than the west also. Freedom of expression and assembly might be a disadvantage here against a more controlled and scared russian populace.

Defeat in detail is how you negate taking huge losses. Russia will loose more than ukraine, but in defeat in detail you control where and when to attack. And can destroy the enemy with extreme massed artillery and manpower, increasing lethality and keeping defenders suppressed and reducing casualties. Defeat in detail is what you do when you are worried about this. 


You would expect russia to lag behind as the attacker on maintenence and local manpower. I believe this is why russia has chosen Defeat in detail to negate these advantage held by the Ukrainians. I would also add NATO equipment is great, but lots of types will start to bring logistical, maintenence and training issues. 

I would say russians continued airstrikes, ballastic missile strikes and drone attacks and even its on going offensive support the fact russia remains able to strike out. Ukrainians by there own admission have admitted to a huge equipment deficits. 

My assertion they would attack from the south, is just that my opinion. Russia now controls the railway from crimea to the donbas, and is having a long time to prepare equipment and logistics in the south. It can reduce supply to the east by blowing the dnipro bridges. They already control part of the west of the river and advancing north from there would threaten to surround and cut off the ukraines forces east pf the dnipro. It also negate the need to use said bridges in the offensive. 

Russia currently has not mobilised it populace. It has a large manpower reserve. It also has conscripted men from terroritories it has taken over. But really using its freedom of movement, and taking advantage of a chaotic collapse on the Eastern front could negate this all together.

I don't think this is important to Ukraine. They might not have that much capacity, but the rest of the world does and most of it is happy to supply them. For the Baltic states, for Poland, and for Finland and Sweden, in their perspective, this is a direct threat to their national security. So the Ukraine has their industrial capacity. For the UK and the US, this is in their national interest so Ukraine also has their capacity. Turkey isn't directly threatened but their arms industry is very important to their national economy and from their perspective this is like one giant promotion video getting passed around twitter every day for 4 months. And the US is happy to pay for it.

I would even say, anything we can do to help Ukraine get grain out of the country is probably more important than them committing a lot more resources to their native arms industry. 

The other thing I'm kind of changing my mind on is how valuable freedom of movement is and what it means. With the new surveillance technology movement has become a lot more dangerous. Moving is how you get everyone blown up. So, it's still something that needs to happen, but definitions of freedom of movement might be in the middle of a shift.

In the future - if Ukraine wins the war - they will simply transition fully to western NATO equipment. Post-war Ukraine will be provided a full standardized refresh of their military equipment and likely be accepted into the EU. But that's assuming they win.

&gt; do you think the aid will continue if ukraine appears to be on the verge of defeat?

No. Well, the aid will change to being short term aid aimed at just enabling Ukraine to do as much damage as possible before losing. If Ukraine is on the verge of losing then you won't see more M777's headed to Ukraine, but maybe more ammo just to allow Ukraine to keep degrading the Russian army before they lose.

However, Ukraine is at no risk of losing and - maybe - has a shot of pushing Russia back. So let the M777's flow.

I would argue the offensives on kharkov and izyum are limited in scope and opportuntistic. (This is not to take credit from the army itself). I would suggest the areas were found to be lightly defended and limited importance to the current russian plans in the donbas. The areas have been destroyed to the point they provide no economic or industrial benefit, they are in fact a burden.  Loosing in these areas would soak up Ukrainian man power, and while defeat in detail in the donbas continues. 

I agree with defeat in detail. It was certainly decided on after the initial plan failed and russia could not muster enough equipment and man power for a full frontal assault. However it remains the prudent tactic to continue. I would argue the days of russian total incompetence is over. 

I don't believe the first assault shows they had limited time. Only they wished to end the conflicted quickly, and had major logistical and intelligence failures. Russia still is able to move its forces freely through russia and Belarus to hit anywhere along that border. Forcing ukraine to keep manpower back. Russia can also build up forces locally and by ukraines own admission it does not have the artillery to counter this. I believe russia is much less worried about the impact of sanctions. I think it believes the west democracies will be unable to withstand the effects before the russian populace rises up.

The only other fact we know is that the Indian SPICE bombs exploded in open fields inside Pakistan. The pilots failed to calculate the proper trajectory and elevation, but please keep making excuses.   


&gt;Let's see, If PL-15 runs like the Chinese claims, it won't be as effective as the meteor. Western tech tends to be more reliable and high tech. Then you pay for those.

Please don't lump all Western Tech into one. American Tech is definitely decades ahead but French, no, they simply don't have the resources to compete with the Chinese. Whether the PL-15 is more effective or not, we will find out just like we found that the so called 'Raptor of Asia' or 'Second Best Fighter Aircraft after F22' turned out to be a dud despite all the Indian hype.   


&gt;Relying on fiction, Western newspapers reported that Paki Amry had sealed off the area. In anycase, if you are mentioning the 300 terrorists then you don't understand what the op was about.

Now you're clutching to straws here and just trying to make yourself feel better. There is enough research that has been done in the West to determine the SPICE bombs hit an open field. Any civilian casualties inside Pakistan would have resulted in similar retaliation from the Pakistani side.

But in all seriousness, cheers for being willing to admit you made an error. Unironically I feel a sense of respect for you, even as a stranger on the internet, for putting honesty above ego. 

To address your points:

1). I think you may actually be somewhat missing my point. Regarding what our best course of action is with the capabilities we'll have in the mid-decade timeframe.. well, we don't really have one. Sometimes, as shitty as it may be, we might just not be able to win. I know it's fairly common for it to be practically a given that the US can win so long as we do X or can stop Y or implement new shiny CONOP Z. However, we've crossed the event horizon on this one, and there currently exists no publicly-disclosed-information-supported means by which the US can contest and defeat the PLA in their near periphery until potentially the latter portion of this decade. We've made our bed, and as much as we may kick and scream, we've pretty much got no choice but to lie in it. Are there things we can theoretically do to reverse this trend of falling US and rising PLA capabilities? Sure. Theoretically. Theoretically we could have stuck to buying 15 FFG-62s by 2026, but instead we slashed that number to 7 by 2027. We could have stuck to our 2 per year Burke fltIII production, but we slashed that to 1 this fiscal year and potentially two next fiscal year in a ""sawtooth"" (neat sales buzzword) production pattern.  We could have invested in maintaining and improving our hull numbers and platform capabilities in their principal role of, y'know, being warships - instead we opted to pursue pseudo-futurist dead-end projects as our unipolar moment began to wane. We could have continued to stress the absolute imperative nature of warfighting prowess to junior officers and everyone who would eventually be responsible for driving, fighting, and keeping the ships; but instead we regressed to a hyper-administrative division-centric peacetime competency-focused navy. 

We just plain and simple ""done fucked up, fucked up real bad""

No way out of it. 

Here's hoping we claw ourselves out of the dumpster by 2030, but with such anemic shipbuilding and sustainment infrastructure, I'd be surprised. 

2). Sure, I guess. Politically there is a need to maintain approval ratings and whatnot, but I really don't see how the ""initial fear of the US going to war"" really means much when basically everything in Biden's power was done to concretely state ""no, bros, we're not going to war."" For as much as public sentiment does hold power over decision making - I'd hesitate to give it as much merit vis-a-vis the IC and the defense industry as a whole's view on things.

The reality is russia has complete freedom of movement, so long as ukraine remains unable to mount a counter offensive or strike out effectively at distance. Even then they can always move through russia itself. 

It is only smart for russia to use defeat in detail. The front is huge, they have the time, freedom and equipment resources to do so.

It is only a matter of time until ukraine could no longer replace and withstand these assualts. 

Ukraine only counter to this is excellent intelligence, long range precision muntions and tactical and movement flexibility.

(Yes, I'm going to commit the cardinal sin of admitting error on the Internet.)

First -- part of what worries me here is exactly the sort of grim future outlook that you seem to share, although perhaps you think we're going to come out of that after a decade or so, which would be more optimistic and good to hear. It's fine to *say* that ""all options are on the table,"" but frankly I wonder how many options really would be on the table in a future scenario where we don't have any forces in Taiwan and China has increased ability to threaten or stop any forces moving there in a crisis. What are we going to do, commence open naval warfare with China? Launch a nuclear first strike out of nowhere to destroy both us and them in nuclear war? Clearly not; this would be stupid.

The domestic and geopolitical consequences of losing even a single modern aircraft carrier are unfathomable, but the actual sinking of a carrier is no longer unthinkable in such scenarios, it seems to me.

Second -- the doubling down bit -- you can tell me all day that public opinion can screw off when it comes to foreign policy, and I will simply observe that whether we like it or not, it's clearly a factor for political leadership. More so during certain parts of the election cycle, and more so for weaker administrations struggling to maintain popularity or Congressional backing. It can't force a leader's hand all the way to great power war, I agree, but it pushes people to make decisions more quickly and to posture more hawkishly than they might prefer -- both of which, again, raise the risk of miscalculation.

Third -- the concession -- the diplomatic and military historians will have to figure all this out 30 years from now, but I realize on reflection that the critical thing that made hawkish posturing for the public potentially hazardous was the large number of European countries trying to one-up each other to aid Ukraine. This factor wouldn't really apply in Taiwan, both because there aren't the sheer number of allies in region who'd want to do it, and because there isn't a big convenient land border to ship in people and supplies through.

Watching that play out I couldn't help but flash back to the pictures of smiling celebrating crowds in 1914.

But that factor is Europe-specific and doesn't really apply to Taiwan, so I agree on reflection that it's probably of limited value to understanding risks and potential scenarios in the far east.

I still think it's worth some reflection here though. You're correct that we didn't have a strategic ambiguity policy on Ukraine. We did have a fairly clear position that there would basically be some undefined sanctions in the event of an invasion, and that fell by the wayside only **after** the invasion, which meant (a) we lost the ability to deter Russia with the threat of the measures we actually were prepared to take and (b) we had to scramble after the fact to contrive a new policy in the middle of a crisis. Both of these are bads to some extent and I feel could hold lessons for how we think about Taiwan -- but I'll concede that it doesn't necessarily mean we have to abandon our current policy.",287749476bb6cd3db32467a702d5933bf4f8c2b3,True,False,,,,,0,1653661286,,0,{},ia72nvx,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia63d6p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia72nvx/,1653661299,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653632486.0,

Even if we assume an optimistic third of all VLS cells we can forward base at Yokosuka are strike length and filled with good ole' TLAM - you're still looking at a maximum of a few hundred TLAMs - and that's not accounting for readiness, or the fact that no sane planner would saddle up a DESRON 15 ship's magazine with too many TLAMs lol. That is, unless the ships are considered a writeoff anyways and all 96 cells per 8 burkes were loaded with them. One can dream. Alas, that wouldn't be technically feasible, operationally feasible, nor would it do much good for shipboard morale knowing they were a floating coral reef that has yet to realize its full subsurface potential.

More realistically, TLAM numbers in 7FLT AOR are in flux between \~250-350 at any given time between the deployed Burkes, whatever Tico is unfortunate enough to be out there with full knowledge of NSLC's behind the scenes grimacing, and subs. That's like, a lot. Like, a lot a lot. It cannot and should not be taken for granted; however it's really nowhere near the kind of numbers you're talking about lol. Realistically speaking, due to the obscenely dense sensor coverage, well integrated and highly capable CMD apparatus the PLA wields, and the subsonic (albeit quite low observable) nature of these munitions - 250-350 munitions can prosecute anywhere from 10-25 targets on the mainland. This is being generous, by the way. There have been runs that model exactly zero TLAMs prosecuting their targets, and that 25 number is above anything I've personally ever seen feasibly weaponeered lol.

&gt;I promise you lol, I'm not trying to lie to you or trick you, this is what myself and many many other people who've put our whole careers into studying this exact scenario have come up with when looking for how best for the PLA to employ their forces.

Dont worry, its probably myself that is just more optimistic and I'm not educated on military matters (basically just a lay man that had some interest in this area).

&gt;A single GMLRS salvo may destroy 10 armored fighting vehicles, but if there is a prosecutable target who's destruction will result in the inability of 20 armored fighting vehicles to get into the fight, it's more advantageous to engage that operational target.

My thoughts is basically that the PLA would have enough capacity to both directly take out those 20 fighting vehicles alongside with say military fuel depots, but again, I suppose I might be way to optimistic. 

&gt;Simply disabling military assets, but leaving Taiwan mostly intact, does little to hasten the atrophy of Taiwanese morale and combat power. If anything, conducting sheerly tactical actions without fires employed with cognizance of the overall objective in mind - will do nothing but motivate defenders. Nothing says ""holy shit this is doable"" like an initial barrage far less fearsome than anticipated, no immediate follow on landing, continued access to global telecommunications, no crippling infrastructure attacks, and a prevailing global sentiment of support. 

Again, I'm probably too optimistic, but I think morale for defenders will be low if they say arrive at ammo storages to see them blown up, arrive at trenches and other fortified positions and see them blown up, see their various armored vehicles constantly being blown up etc.

What's more, I personally also think that some PLA initial landing could happen quite quickly (within a few days of opening fire). Which is probably again be overly optimistic. 


Tldr: I'm probably overestimating the amount of drones, airplanes and precision fire the PLA might be able to blanket Taiwan with.

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"&gt;You answer this basically with the below quote.

I'm not super sure how lol. The point I was trying to make is that ""only"" targeting exclusively military targets and attempting to decrease civilian suffering is a bad idea rooted in good intentions. Ultimately, liberal application of fires in a sheer-bandwidth TOT salvo will shatter morale far quicker than tactical warfighting. 

I'm not sure how well read you are on PLA Operational Concepts, but the principal method by which the PLA (and especially the PLAAF/PLARF) employs fires is through a principal known as ""Target Centric Warfare."" In short, this is the principal of identifying and eliminating key ""enablers"" within an ""Operational System"" (another PLA concept) so as to most efficiently achieve a desired state of affairs. This, very very importantly, is an *operational* model of warfare. Fighting an operational-level campaign is very different than fighting a tactical one. Attacking tactical targets all day and all night may be the least harmful to the civilian population, but it is also the least effective way of allocating fires to targets. A single GMLRS salvo may destroy 10 armored fighting vehicles, but if there is a prosecutable target who's destruction will result in the inability of 20 armored fighting vehicles to get into the fight, it's more advantageous to engage that *operational* target.

The bedrock of Systems Destruction Warfare, which is PLA Warfare, is to target the operational system - not the tactical platforms. To this end:

&gt;quickly and efficiently take out air and missile defenses in the opening hours (some might survive, but ultimately will be hunted down by various means), before then basically swarming the skies over Taiwan with drones and planes, at which point it really kind of 'just' becomes hunting season for remaining stuff

is a lovely goal, but what does it achieve beyond making the PLA untouchable? In the event that water, food, and other infrastructure is untouched, many forces will remain willing and able to coordinate and resist invasion for a non-insignificant period of time. This allows for frontloading of defenses, in which the overwhelming majority of planning, organization, etc. can be done in the initial phases - and asymmetric defense can be conducted by small, highly autonomous teams in complex terrain with weapon systems enabling them to do as much damage as possible before egressing or perishing. While their food supplies would indeed dwindle eventually, and their energy infrastructure would run itself dry after a time - it will only do so after the initial ""shock"" of the opening salvo subsides, after folks can organize and equip themselves for asymmetric operations, and after Taiwanese citizens are permitted ample access to the outside world. 

Simply disabling military assets, but leaving Taiwan mostly intact, does little to hasten the atrophy of Taiwanese morale and combat power. If anything, conducting sheerly tactical actions without fires employed with cognizance of the overall objective in mind - will do nothing but motivate defenders. Nothing says ""holy shit this is doable"" like an initial barrage far less fearsome than anticipated, no immediate follow on landing, continued access to global telecommunications, no crippling infrastructure attacks, and a prevailing global sentiment of support. 

It's simply not prudent to ""avoid civilian suffering"" if all it serves to do is turn Taiwan from a walkover into a meat grinder. Furthermore, again - just to reiterate - the food supplies *will* eventually dwindle, energy *will* eventually run out (leaving only solar and locally sourced energy, which would constitute dual use at best, but mostly ""civilian"" targets, meaning much of it would be left untouched in your conceptual ""military targets only"" employment of fires, which will leave the civilians still suffering - but will allow the military to set up solar and other distributed energy generation ""mini-plants"" to keep them in the fight. 

I really hope you see what I'm saying, because I'm not sure how much clearer I can illuminate it. Without being willing to employ the full breadth of combat power at their disposal, the PLA will *only* be inviting a far worse situation. In its most egregious state of restraint, a-la your ""military targets only"" concept, it will actively worsen the situation on the ground for amphibious forces during the ground war.

Regarding the hypersonic field at least, it is the general consensus that, yes, the US is considerably behind in terms of research, development of platforms, and fielding of such systems. I can’t comment exactly how far (I.e 5 or 10 years) behind though.

As a interesting side note, its actually a bit of a sore spot for my workplace because we actually developed an early hypersonic platform/prototype a few decades back.

Abstract:

*What determines military effectiveness? Though political scientists have studied the sources of military effectiveness, they have generally ignored the role of military leadership, a factor that historians have emphasized as crucial for effectiveness. This article presents the first rigorous examination of the proposition that militaries improve effectiveness by replacing low-performing leaders.*

*The article tests three theories describ- ing how militaries promote and demote leaders: (1) military leaders are promoted and demoted on the basis of combat performance; (2) politi- cal leaders fearful of coups do not demote low-performing military leaders, as a coup-proofing tactic; and (3) military leaders that belong to powerful interpersonal networks are less likely to be demoted and more likely to be promoted.* 

*Hypotheses are tested using new data on all American and German generals holding combat commands in the North African, Italian, and West European theaters in World War II and new data on the monthly combat performance of American and German divisions in these theaters.* 

*Analysis reveals that both armies replaced low-performing generals (coup-proofing motives did not prevent Hitler from demoting low performers) and that interpersonal networks in the US army did not block demotion of low performers. Also, the replacement of low-performing generals improved combat effectiveness in both armies.* 

————————

&gt; * In both the German and American armies, low-performing generals were more likely to be replaced, and replacement of low- performing generals significantly boosted military effectiveness. 

&gt; * The article makes three important contributions to IR. First, it improves our understanding of the sources of military effectiveness. The article provides some of the first rigorous evidence demonstrating that militaries improve effectiveness by replacing poorly performing leaders, and more generally that quality leader- ship boosts effectiveness. 

&gt; * Second, the article improves our understanding of how military organizations behave. The results here support a more Weberian view of militaries as functionalist organizations, pushing back against perspec- tives that militaries are always hidebound organizations slow to adapt, impeded by factors such as interpersonal networks and coup-proofing dynamics. 

&gt; * Third, the article contributes to an ongoing empirical debate about the sources of American and German military effectiveness in World War II, providing support for the argument that one reason American forces fought well in World War II was the willingness of the American high command to dismiss low-performing generals. 

&gt; * However, there is almost no IR work on the impact of military leadership on military effectiveness, or on the determinants of the promotion and demotion of military leaders, especially in wartime.2 This lacuna is especially striking given the great emphasis that military historians and other observers have placed on mili- tary leadership as a critical determinant of military effectiveness for millennia. 

&gt; * We propose that effec- tive military leaders exhibit one or more of the following three qualities. First, ef- fective military leaders inspire their soldiers to fight and die for their country and their unit. Different leaders employ different strategies for motivating their soldiers, including making competent decisions, applying brutal discipline, and/or conveying concern for the well-being of their troops. 

&gt; * Second, quality leaders are masters of the craft of combat. 

&gt; * Third, leaders choose subordinates, and quality leaders are more likely to choose quality subordinates, who in turn bolster performance. 

&gt; * Changing leaders offers the possibility of a rapid improvement in performance, as the implementation of strategy or new technol- ogy can take more time. Financially, changing leadership is relatively cheap, as it does not require buying new equipment or revamping training programs. 

&gt; * A central coup-proofing measure is the promotion and retention of mili- tary officers on the basis of political reliability, as manifested by factors such as fa- milial ties, ethnic kinship, or ideological affinity with the political leader, rather than by professional competence. 

&gt; * Analyzing a small number of World War II generals, Ricks (2012) speculated that the United States fought well in World War II because it replaced low-performing generals with better-performing generals. It is important to test the Ricks thesis rigorously, as he did not, and it does not re- flect a consensus among historians. For example, Blumenson disagreed with the view that the worst American generals were removed, observing instead that most American decisions to relieve generals in World War II were “unwarranted if not altogether unjustified” (quoted in Ricks 2012, 110). 

&gt; * Missing data issues aside, there are conceptual problems with using casualty data, as in some circumstances military forces may be willing to suffer casualties, or may need to suffer casualties, in order to accomplish goals such as seizing or preventing the seizure of territory (Reiter 2009, chapter 4; Grauer 2016). For example, in the first phase of the highly successful 2007 change in American military strategy in the Iraq War, US combat casualties went up as American forces took the necessary steps of increas- ing their patrols among the population (Ricks 2009, 238). 

&gt; * Table 2 demonstrates that better combat performance significantly reduces the chance that a general will be demoted, but has no significant effect on the chance that a general will be promoted, across the full, American, and German samples. 

&gt; * We find very strong evidence, both substantively and statisti- cally, that SS membership significantly reduces the likelihood of demotion. 

&gt; * We do not find a significant effect of SS membership on promotion. 

&gt; * One possible concern is that generals might be removed only after fighting has ceased and not while fighting is still ongoing. However, the data do not indicate such a relationship. 

&gt; * In our empirical sample, militaries improved combat performance by replacing poorly performing generals.

If we consider the Russian real war goal, which is in all likelihood a long-term weakening of Ukraine (recognised by Moscow as a permanent adversary), then seizing Donetsk and Luhansk entire is not enough to achieve that.

**pre-2022**: 40 million Ukraine vs 2-3 million DPR&amp;LPR was unsustainable and required permanent heavy Russian military presence to protect the separatist regions. NATO was arming Ukraine and any crisis elsewhere (Asia, Caucasus) that drew away the Russian military would have probably resulted in a Ukrainian offensive to retake the DPR&amp;LPR.

**post-2022**: With only Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson and half Zaporizhzhia seized by Russia we have about 35 million Ukraine (3-4 million refugees will probably not return) vs 4 million DPR&amp;LPR. Still unsustainable, still requires a heavy Russian military presence. While technically a win (significant territory seized) it is a strategic loss for Russia.

To achieve some kind of minimum military counter-balance to Ukraine Russia would need to capture the territory with at least 10 million people, leaving a hostile Ukraine of about 30 million. Then they would hope that through a period of indoctrination similar to the one that had already taken place in Donetsk and Luhansk they could create a separatist 10-million buffer region hostile to Ukraine.

We haven't seen any indication thus far that it is meant for or capable of anti shipping, despite what some people claim, but I still appraise them fairly highly. all around solid, low CEP, *relatively* inexpensive (all things considered) prompt fires with a difficult-to-prosecute profile to-boot. 

DF-21s are cool, not amazing. DF-21C is worth concerning ones-self about, but it doesn't appear to be quite at the level of precision of some of the more modern munitions. DF-21D is pretty cool though, and without getting into anything better discussed elsewhere, I would say it is entirely reasonable to expect the overall PLA anti-shipping complex to gain a good amount of lethality from it. People have this weird conception that AShBMs are a standalone weapons system, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Salvo generation is a multiplayer game, and all sorts of various munitions will be tapped to overwhelm/penetrate a naval force's kinetic, ea, and countermeasure capabilities. DF-21Ds serve as an excellent additional threat vector, in that SM-6s must be used more sparingly at risk of not having enough to defend an AShBM salvo at a high enough Pra (Probability of Rapid Annihilation - goofy acronym but the navy came up with it not me so whatever), especially when considering other threats that may be present, to reliably not... well... die lol. DF-26s are pretty similar in this regard, but just a bit heftier, likely have some added knick-knacks, and have a nifty multirole capability in the form of hot-swappable warheads. At a brigade or base's comprehensive support regiment, when these missiles are mated to their tels or reload vehicles, they can be fitted with an anti shipping, conventional, or nuclear warhead - and that makes them pretty cool for being a ""unified"" long range prompt precision fires system.

Don't really know what more to say than yeah they're seemingly competent weapon systems that pose a considerable threat and thus have to be factored into our own planning

our own hypersonics are like, a weird mix of a couple years ahead and a few years behind lol. I don't really believe in ""behind"" or ""ahead"" in terms of military tech, only in terms of ""do you have this or not"" ""what are you going to use it for"" ""how are you going to use it"" and ""how many do you have."" those sorts of behind/ahead abstractions aren't super useful. Some of our niftier munitions (go look up VINTAGE RACER lol) are pretty whizbang, but other programs (\*cough\* arrw \*cough\*) are sort of a dumpster fire in comparison. We're pretty lacking in terms of precision fires volume overall though, so I'll take pretty much any weapon system I can get that is employable in volume, can penetrate defenses and achieve effects on target, and doesn't require an obscene amount of resources to generate fires of. 

Uh, as far as those other missiles go, let's start with the DF-10. It's pretty alright, I don't know what more to say about it lol. We don't believe it's as capable as TLAM due to it not being shaped for signature optimization, it likely possesses a less sophisticated datalink, and is pretty unlikely to be able to coordinate with other munitions or to prosecut targets autonomously. What it *is* though, is a solid, affordable, still-pretty-low-RCS, volume-optimized source of precision fires. It's seemingly being superseded by the newer DF-100, which *is* a pretty scary system. So far it looks like it's been inducted into iirc 656 Bde and one other unit I can't remember. Pretty sensible mid to high supersonic munition that we think has some solid EP and terminal maneuvering characteristics if employed in an anti-shipping role, but I won't speak too much more on those sorts of specifics. 

YJ-18s are awesome. I actually really like them, and wish we had something of the sort ourselves. Love me a good VL-AShM. They're not perfect, and they of course suffer from many of the drawbacks of all subsonic AShMs, but unless they get NIFC-CA'd out of the sky by an SM-6 or something, they're pretty scary little fuckers when they go terminal. It's public, so I'm gladly able to rave about it, but they've been pretty well ""remastered"" from the original Klub platform. They've got multimode seekers (AESA ARH and passive RH, so I guess technically still both radar, but one's active one's more akin to an ARM, so bite me, it's multi-mode with chinese characteristics or something), some pretty neat EP on board, and a lot of datalink voodoofuckery to-boot. I wouldn't rate SLQ-32 as very effective against these little bastards until new SEWIP pays dividends. The neat thing about them is that as their cruise-motor section decouples from the boost-vehicle, it has a pretty sizable RCS of its own, and will continue to fly for a little bit as the boost-vehicle makes serpentine squiggles when it gets painted (those old spg-62 x band illuminators super suck, i hate em, and they're gonna finally be useless once sm2mrblkiiic hits vls cells and essm blk ii hits... also vls cells), which makes holding a track on them a fairly serious challenge, especially given how small in size and signature those little boost-vehicles are. RAM apparently has some pretty okay odds against them if it can find a kinematically favorable cue for the weapon (tho ofc aegis has to pass that cue to the ram first, which is a little bit of a suck), but those are still liable to dump their energy into chasing squiggles. anyhow, overall, great fuckin weapon and I really want a YJ-18 with freedom characteristics for our own surface force. 

YJ-12s are cool too. Overall just generally good all around supersonic ashm. all the cool EP you'd imagine present is believed to be so, terminal evasion is a pretty neat trick, though a little less scary than the YJ-18s terminal capabilities just on pain of RCS and physical target cross section lol. Supersonic transit is the big one for those guys - no need to play a guessing game as to where in an AoU (area of uncertainty) your surface contact is gonna scamper off to - it's a game of ""which way are they heading? how fast? how far do they go in about 6 minutes? cool, that's our aimpoint"" lol.

Surely Putin would declare victory in this scenario, and significant pressure would be put on the Ukrainian leadership to make some concessions.

Firstly though I'd like to contend the implication that they ""didn't pull themselves up by their boostraps"" to get where they are. 

As much as I dislike the CCP, and as much as I would love to say ""you were literally given all the investment you could ask for and then some, just so that we could fuck with the soviet union"" and be done with things, doing so would be to unacceptably downplay the Chinese population's own efforts. 

It is absolutely true that without our own effort to ""open up"" China that they wouldn't be where they are today - but it takes two to tango. Chinese citizens worked difficult, dangerous, and dirty jobs for hours that most people here wouldn't stomach working even in a cushy office role, and they did it for wages low enough it'd make Bernie lose his accent. Pragmatic, thoughtful decision making on the part of the CCP in the wake of Deng's laying of the groundwork are what drove China into the limelight as a manufacturing powerhouse. Throughout the 90s, the government continued functioning as a startlingly effective instrument of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization. All the while, the (again, I begrudgingly admit, surprisingly well-executed) investment into education, heavy industry, and modernization continued to plant seeds that the PRC is still reaping. 

Into the 2000s, and under Hu Jintao (more like with Hu Jintao figure-heading and the committee doing much of the decision making tbh), a further set of modernization, urbanization, and various other programs were enacted that resulted in enormous growth in China's economy. Again, while it certainly was made possible in part due to ""generosity"" on the part of the West, it was - especially by this point - overwhelmingly driven by China's own competitiveness on the global market. Chinese citizens worked extraordinarily hard, for remarkably low wages, in remarkably poor comparative living conditions outside of the metropolitan centers (which at this point were still relatively ""small"" compared to what they have become, there's that famous shanghai 1990 vs 2017 picture for example). Chinese students put forth a significant effort to perform well academically, and those seeds previously planted when seeking to transition from an unskilled, low-wage, light-industrial + agrarian economy into a technological, industrial, and economic power in its own right began to bear fruit throughout the 2000s. During this period, the Chinese economy exploded - growing nearly exponentially from \~1T USD to \~6T USD between 2000 to 2010. 

During the 2000s, an infrastructure effort that pretty well dwarfs anything that had been carried out in recent history was put into place as well. The increasingly well educated Chinese STEM sector began to flex its muscles more and more, and computing and technology-centric fields began to grow enormously throughout the late 2000s. Into the 2010s, the PRC was at the height of its infrastructure boom. From 2011 to 2013 for example, the PRC used more concrete than the United States used during the *entire 20th century*. They, with very little hyperbole, built their *entire country* over the course of 10-15 years. 

Again, while Western investment and stimulation had prompted this growth spurt, it was ultimately the Chinese themselves who took the opportunity, used it *extremely* wisely (as we're unfortunately seeing the result of nowadays), and put in the genuine resources and effort to exploit it to the fullest. Chinese workers putting in 10+ hours a day at their places of work, every single day, Chinese students working to succeed academically and motivated by a sense of optimism about the future, and a Chinese leadership performing well above the level of most governmental bodies in fostering that sense of devotion, and harnessing the fruits of the citizens' effort in furtherance of ""common prosperity"" as is the term. They turned their nation from one poorer than Sub-saharan african nations (not an exaggeration) into the largest domestic economy in the world, the largest PPP adjusted GDP in the world (which, while it isn't suitable for all metrics, I believe PPP's relation to domestic productivity is relevant here), a technological superpower (if you work in the AI/ML field or any compsci field tbh you'll know exactly what I mean), and have pretty much done all of it with their own competence, their own hard work, and took an (especially in comparison to where they are now) extremely minor set of advantages they were given to get the process started. 

I really don't like them, but what they did *worked;* and as much as I may bash them elsewhere, this is one where I can't do much but throw my hands up, take a deep breath, and say ""yeah that whole economic development thing was pretty fuckin solid, I wish we could do that here.""

Vis-a-vis specific issues mainlanders have with the established international order, it depends. One of the easier ones to point to is the extremely conciliatory treatment given to Japan post WWII, despite the uh, *not fantastic* display they put on during the IJA's tour-de-China. The fact that the post-Taiwan-flee PRC was treated like a force of evil, and was prevented from concluding their Civil War (a lengthy and bloody one at that - imagine how pissed people would have been if Britain had intervened and stopped the Union from recapturing the Confederate states in mid-late 1864) while Japanese *abject war criminals* walked free and were allowed to be covered up and expunged from popular Japanese memory - well, it didn't and continues not to sit very well with China. 

Another, and a very obvious one, being Taiwan. No matter how you yourself may view Taiwan or the ideological aspects of it - The PRC views it as a Chinese affair that the US intervened in and has ""bullied"" the Chinese out of completing. Again, think of how the Union would perceive a British prevention of the American Civil War's conclusion in late 1864 after it had been all but won, and then decried it as ""expansionism"" and ""imperialism"" lol. I personally support Taiwanese independence, but I recognize that it's totally a hypocritical position given that the US and Europe reaped the spoils of rampant imperialism/expansionism for a good portion of post-napoleonic history, but turn around after we've ""gotten ours"" to say ""wait no that's bad China stop"" before they ""get theirs."" Easy way of thinking about it is, imagine if a group of kids cheated on a test and all got extremely high scores because of it, then cheated off of you and did well on the test as a result despite the teacher docking you for ""cheating"" and then, when they get into the same prestigious school as you because of their cheated grades, if you opt to cheat off of them, they stand up and shriek ""oh my GOD HE'S CHEATING HOW COULD HE DO THIS, THERE ARE RULES!!"" and rally the entire class against you. Go Taiwan, but it's for this reason that I don't decry China's ambitions on a moralistic or principled level, just on a natsec and fopo one.

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"Indeed you are. Feel free to read through my other posts a bit if you'd like some lengthy description, but the Western Pacific (within the second island chain, to be specific) heavily favors the PLA, and everything within the first island chain may as well be considered a writeoff.

While the PLA of 15, or even as recent as 10 years ago was hardly a mach for US forces at their doorstep, the strides they've made in basically every single aspect of their armed forces are *extremely* impressive. A Navy with modern DDGs countable on one hand, an Air Force comprised of largely antiquated Soviet Era relics, an Army barely at the foot of the modernization mountain, and an overall technological base still far behind that of the US. These were the PLA's branches circa 2010. 

As of today, they have arguably one of if not outright the most modern (from a systems perspective as well as a totalistic whole-force-design perspective), comprehensive, and capable systems of warfighting in the world, a close second only to the United States. I could go through every single vessel in the PLAN and describe it, but suffice to say, their 30+ modern DDGs, each with more potent ASuW suites than anything aboard any US vessel, with sensor and combat management systems easily on par with - and in some areas, exceeding the capabilities of - the US (notably, Type 346A/Bs aboard modern PLAN DDGs, as well as the force-wide ""networking"" of assets together into one cooperative sensor/shooter complex). Their shipborne AAW capabilities are entirely on par with - and again, in some cases exceeding - that of US platforms, courtesy of the HHQ-9B, and soon to increase further with the 5-5-5 munition. They have by far the largest surface-vessel ASW capability of any Navy (including the USN) with all 50 056As, all 37+ 054As, all \~20+ (Currently 6 are being built simultaneously in a single Drydock at iirc Dalian) 052Ds, all 8 055s, and several older platforms such as the imported 956s and, if memory serves, one or more of their 052Cs. 

Not only can the PLAN match us system for system in 7th Fleet at any given time -- they are more capable systems (there exists nothing a Burke can throw at a 052D that could reasonably be expected to knock the 052D out; the inverse is not the case), more competently crewed (I can get into the massive issues facing the SWO community if you want, and how our Navy is hamstrung by a myriad of failings that impact our ability to not just drive the ship, but to fight the ship if it were to come to it; and how it compares to the *extremely concerning* level of effort the PLA has put into developing capable naval *warfighters* instead of competent naval box-checkers and division heads), better supported (land based airpower sure is nice - it's like an aircraft carrier but never sinks and hosts way more aircraft!), better sustained (the US auxiliary fleet is in startlingly poor shape, and one of the most common conclusions I have the *joy* of presenting at my day job is that our forces in the Western Pacific cannot operate at the scale and tempo that is required when fighting a peer threat like China), and holds the initiative in any conflict. 

This isn't even mentioning airpower. The PLAAF and PLANAF are absolutely jaw-dropping in terms of the fires they are capable of generating even out to the second island chain. The PLANAF alone is capable of putting up salvos of high-triple-digit size (YJ-12s and YJ-83s) even out past Japan, and low triple digits out almost to Guam. Again, this isn't even counting the fires that surface forces are capable of contributing to a salvo. The PLAAF as well is capable of abjectly destroying US and Japanese sortie generation infrastructure in the first island chain, and can claim ""supremacy"" anywhere out to about Hokkaido in the north, Singapore in the south, and about 2/3rds the way to Guam to the East. They've had the benefit of designing and procuring their force with all the modern considerations being practically ""freebies"" compared to what we have to do when upgrading airframes. J-16s, J-11BGs, J-20s, J-10B and Cs, and their other newer airframes all sport AESAs, modern avionic suites, modern CEC/Datalink capabilities (including the ability to cue PL-15s from their KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which is impressive), and a myriad of other ""capes"" as the afrl nerds keep trying to call them. 

This isn't even mentioning the PLARF, which is their ""assassins mace"" as is sometimes referenced (in that the PLARF is like a ""single, deadly blow"" weapon capable of taking an enemy out before a fight even begins). My friend Decker Eveleth is working on an updated ORBAT for the PLARF right now, which should be finished in the coming weeks which I'll be happy to send you. In short, the PLA fields an absolutely obscene amount of conventional SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs in their own branch, and they are the sort of thing that keeps analysts like myself up at night. Their ability to strike at targets in Taiwan, Okinawa, South Korea (irrelevant, SK is not likely to become militarily involved in a US-PRC war), and more -- including Guam -- in a matter of minutes, is not something to be taken lightly. Warning times for munitions from Base 61's HGV Brigades are less than 5 minutes from absolute best possible luck, positioning, attentiveness, and availability detection to impact. These munitions are also, unlike Russian analogues, *effective*. Not only does the PLA have the technological base, the financial resources, and the microelectronics manufacturing and integration prowess needed to develop these sorts of munitions, but they train extensively with them as well. The US Department of State reported that by September of 2021, the PLA had launched over 250 Ballistic missiles in exercises that year alone. All satellite imagery and, while not really meaningful, all video/imagery released by the PLA themselves, shows CEP figures entirely in line with - if not superior to - the most ""generally accepted"" estimates for many of these munitions. Even Iran, who works with exported Chinese technology and assistance, has developed ballistic missiles which have *demonstrated* an operational CEP of sub 10 meters. *Freaking* ***IRAN.***

All of this is meshed together into a modern, sensible, and highly ""informationized"" (PLA term closest in meaning to ""Networked"" as used by the US Military, though more extensive and institutional/systemic in nature - i.e. the employment of autonomous tugs aboard 075s, the employment of AR goggles for equipment maintenance, BMS available to platoon and sometimes squad leaders (analogues) in HMCABs, organic SUAS fielded to maneuver formations at the platoon/company level, an *enormous* training simulation apparatus, exceeding even the US in many aspects, computerized umpiring of wargames and exercises, and employment of data-centric optimization of their forces based off of the data collected, AI-driven decision making aids for commanders, modern datalinks and information fusion organic to practically every single modern PLA weapon system, PLASSF data fusion centers responsible for taking in *all* the data collected by *all* sensors and systems, meshing it together into a more coherent, complete picture of the battlespace, and then disseminating it so that everyone has the best possible picture of the battlespace, and a gazillion other emergent properties) system of generating, sustaining, and jointly synchronizing and employing combat power to achieve desired effects on an enemy operational system (part of the PLA's concept of System Destruction Warfare, and the fires employment doctrine of Target Centric Warfare).

Strictly speaking, there is no existential threat to *Japan* as an entity by the PRC's ascension to regional hegemony. However, there is an existential threat posed to the *Japanese State* as it currently exists. 

Frankly, beyond territorial claims to the Senkakus/Diaoyus, there isn't any inherent contention present in the JP/PRC diplomatic relationship (barring historical enmity for the rather treatment Chinese citizens faced at the hands of the IJA). I don't think there is any reality in which China goes Hearts of Iron IV mode and captures Tokyo in furtherance of some thoughtless expansionist agenda (though you would be surprised just how many people believe this to be not just possible, but *likely* should the PLA capture Taiwan). 

The friction comes from Japan's presence in the US-led order. The government of Japan exists in its current form one level above being a US client state. Much of the political apparatus of Japan is built around relations with the US, much of the JSDF is organized and equipped to support US operations, and much of Japan's current foreign policy is tethered to the US's interests. Furthermore, the population generally supports this status quo. Support for the US is fairly widespread, with \~75% of Japanese citizens polled stating they ""Trust"" the US, in contrast with only 7% towards the PRC. The fabric of modern Japanese society is as much intertwined with American influence as it is with historical roots - and I don't believe the two will separate quite so easily. 

Should the United States be ""pushed out"" of the Pacific (without some form of conflict taking place), Japan will be forced to contend with a geopolitical landscape entirely incongruent with the one it is developed for, and will either become a regional pariah that remains US aligned, or will be forced to tear themselves away from those Red-White-and-Blue foundations upon which the modern Japanese state, political system, and society have been built. This aspect is what I view to be existential.

Could Japan realign itself as a neutral player in the Western Pacific, cooperating with both the US and China on an equal basis, and reconciling differences with the PRC? Absolutely. There's no reason why a Japan willing to become a Chinese-aligned nation should be or feel threatened by the PRC. However, that's the issue. Doing this would mean a fundamental shift for Japan - one that they seem entirely unwilling to make. 

As such, yes. I agree, there is place a-plenty for Japan at the table of nations even in a China-led Western Pacific. However, that Japan is so fundamentally different from the Japan of today that much of the political establishment, and a non-insignificant portion of the citizenry would be wiling to commit what amounts to economic suicide at the cost of many lives, enormous damage, and dim hope for a victorious end - rather than making the ""pragmatic"" decision and working towards their own best interests.

[],False,,Anti_Imperialist7898,,,[],,,,text,t2_4e1dk3xy,False,False,"&gt;However, if Taiwan were intent on a scorched-Earth course of action (which I personally doubt), and decided that if they were going to be ""reunified"" that they were, for some reason, better off doing so without the most notable engine of their economic success to rely on during post-war reconstruction... well, not much the PLA can do

I agree (unlikely they would scorch-earth and that there's not much the PLA could do if they did). 

&gt;However, I'd ask you then, where is Taiwan to get its energy from during this conflict? Where is it to get its food from? Ultimately, whether or not the infrastructure is directly targeted, they will deplete their energy reserves extremely rapidly, and will no longer be capable of running the majority of those services regardless. 

You answer this basically with the below quote. 

&gt;Similarly, should the PLA initiate ""re-integration"" by force, it is best for them to do so as quickly as possible, and to stack the deck as much in the PRC's favor as is possible. A swift, violent war is orders of magnitude more bearable than a protracted, ""polite"" war if the civilian population is without food, utilities, and other basic services (which, they will be). 

Although we can't ofc know if that is what will happen/how it would play out. 

&gt;Because again, keep in mind, Taiwan isn't keen to simply take things lying down. They do possess small amounts of their own munitions capable of striking targets on the mainland. Whether these munitions would be able to make it to their targets before being intercepted, jammed, or otherwise is irrelevant. The ability for Taiwanese forces to organize a defense, and allowing them the ability to - even for a brief period of time - employ their national infrastructure for use in conducting military operations, is something I can't imagine PLA planners are willing to accept. 

In the grand scheme I don't think this will truly end up mattering though (PLA defenses, as well attacks on these weapons). 

&gt;This is an operational infinitive. In the military science context, it's essentially a declaration without quantification. A similar sort of statement would be, ""The F-35 can shoot down any other plane"" or ""A Carrier Strike Group has SM-3 and SM-6s which can intercept ballistic missiles."" 

&gt;Operational Infinitives are extremely bad form in the OA field for lots of reasons, but most notably, because they mean absolutely nothing. What exactly are these capabilities the PLA possesses? How to they present a reasonable alternative to a strategy of attrition and mopping up? What is their advantage over this strategy? Where does this ""firepower"" come from? How long can they sustain these fires? What opposes or complicates the employment of these fires? How do these fires integrate into the overall Operational System the PLA stands up?

This is my bad, I should have clarified.

What I meant was that I find it likely that the PLA would be able to quickly and efficiently take out air and missile defenses in the opening hours (some might survive, but ultimately will be hunted down by various means), before then basically swarming the skies over Taiwan with drones and planes, at which point it really kind of 'just' becomes hunting season for remaining stuff (whatever defenses left over as well as stuff like tanks, artillery etc.) 

&gt;Firstly, casualties. A Taiwan not weakened, demoralized, and de-fanged is a Taiwan more able to kill PLA soldiers and destroy PLA systems. For every civilian or dual use target not prosecuted, it has the potential to lead to dozens, hundreds, or if the target is significant enough, thousands of extra casualties

Depending on how many missiles the PLA can get fired at Taiwan, I think morale for ROC soldiers will be low, especially if the above happens (drones and planes hunting for stuff). What's more, why 'waste' missiles on civilian targets? Why not ruthlessly target military targets (be it logistics or actual combat equipment). 

&gt;Thirdly, that aforementioned force-detraction. You wanna know what's hard? Fighting the United States and her allies. You wanna know what's also hard? Conducting a combined arms over the horizon amphibious operation. You wanna know what's really hard? Doing both at the same time. 

I know, but what I've been describing up till now is basically without setting troops on the ground. Ofc they will be needed, but if the US intervenes before any landings, the landings will be postponed (drone presence would likely continue over Taiwan to make sure it has been 'supressed').

If the US intervenes after the PLA has started landings, this would massively complicate things, although I think in this scenarios, the continued landing/invasion would also get postponed, and they would basically say good luck to the forces already landed on Taiwan (well, dig down as well as try taking some city or the likes to get some rations/food/supplies).

Afterall, if the PLA loses, then it won't be able to take Taiwan, if they don't, then I don't see Taiwan not surrendering, even if not, they would be able to take their time reinforcing and taking Taiwan.",2e8baf12aed1a9525864778aabe8f4388c941793,True,False,,,,,0,1653648046,,0,{},ia6etdx,False,t3_uyl45a,False,False,t1_ia6d9cm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia6etdx/,1653648060,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653619246.0,
[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"&gt;The question is how devasted they would be in the event of a conflict.

Well, that really depends more on Taiwan than anything lol. Targeting of key industries and infrastructure will have the knock-on effect of TSMC halting operations during a PRC-ROC conflict. As such, the fabs won't really constitute a meaningful target for PLA forces to employ fires on. There's really no reason to attack them if they're not only not doing anything, but would have a significant economic value at the cessation of hostilities. However, if Taiwan were intent on a scorched-Earth course of action (which I personally doubt), and decided that if they were going to be ""reunified"" that they were, for some reason, better off doing so without the most notable engine of their economic success to rely on during post-war reconstruction... well, not much the PLA can do.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Personally I don't fully share your view of the PLA targeting lots of civilian targets (such as running water and electricity) with destructive weapons (I do think some sabotaged of power stations might be done). 

No worries, there's plenty of folks who think this sort of thing wouldn't be done. However, I'd ask you then, where is Taiwan to get its energy from during this conflict? Where is it to get its food from? Ultimately, whether or not the infrastructure is directly targeted, they will deplete their energy reserves extremely rapidly, and will no longer be capable of running the majority of those services regardless. Small generators, solar panels, and other sorts of distributed power generation would help keep military forces going until they either ran out of fuel themselves, or their (necessarily exposed-to-the-sun) mounts were targeted by PLA airpower. 

All of this results in a Taiwan left suffering no matter what. In war, there is always suffering. That's why it's so awful. Attempting a swift, near-bloodless ""special military operation"" style campaign, in which the full brunt of capabilities are passed over in favor of limiting destruction is a recipe for disaster. Similarly, should the PLA initiate ""re-integration"" by force, it is best for them to do so as quickly as possible, and to stack the deck as much in the PRC's favor as is possible. A swift, violent war is orders of magnitude more bearable than a protracted, ""polite"" war if the civilian population is without food, utilities, and other basic services (which, they will be). 

By targeting these facilities from the get-go, the PRC is simply able to reduce the amount of time they will still have access to them (which also reduces the military threat Taiwan poses - because remember, the PLA will be fighting the US and likely Japan as well), and will be able to demoralize the population more through rapid, wholesale destruction of Taiwanese infrastructure during the opening, most-fearful and confusing hours of war than by a ""limited"" target set that allows Taiwan time to settle in and organize.

Because again, keep in mind, Taiwan isn't keen to simply take things lying down. They do possess small amounts of their own munitions capable of striking targets on the mainland. Whether these munitions would be able to make it to their targets before being intercepted, jammed, or otherwise is irrelevant. The ability for Taiwanese forces to organize a defense, and allowing them the ability to - even for a brief period of time - employ their national infrastructure for use in conducting military operations, is something I can't imagine PLA planners are willing to accept. 

&gt;and I also think the PLA has more than enough fire power to only go for military targets, even down to hunting tanks with drones

This is an operational infinitive. In the military science context, it's essentially a declaration without quantification. A similar sort of statement would be, ""The F-35 can shoot down any other plane"" or ""A Carrier Strike Group has SM-3 and SM-6s which can intercept ballistic missiles."" 

Operational Infinitives are extremely bad form in the OA field for lots of reasons, but most notably, because they mean absolutely nothing. What exactly are these capabilities the PLA possesses? How to they present a reasonable alternative to a strategy of attrition and mopping up? What is their advantage over this strategy? Where does this ""firepower"" come from? How long can they sustain these fires? What opposes or complicates the employment of these fires? How do these fires integrate into the overall Operational System the PLA stands up?

All of these questions are imperative when making statements like that. I even left out the majority of things I can ask for brevity's sake. Sure, the PLA may be able to conduct a day 0, telegraphed amphibious operation using both conventional and asymmetric sealift, prosecute only exclusively-military targets, and achieve victory. However, for a myriad of reasons, this is infinitely less preferable. 

Firstly, casualties. A Taiwan not weakened, demoralized, and de-fanged is a Taiwan more able to kill PLA soldiers and destroy PLA systems. For every civilian or dual use target not prosecuted, it has the potential to lead to dozens, hundreds, or if the target is significant enough, thousands of extra casualties. 

Secondly, logistics. The larger the land component of an invasion force is, the more sustainment it requires. By allowing ROCA anything short of the worst possible conditions, there must then be more forces committed to confronting and defeating the ROCA. This imposes increased logistical demands, complicates planning, creates a more vulnerable sustainment apparatus, and detracts from the forces able to be employed elsewhere against more significant foes. 

Thirdly, that aforementioned force-detraction. You wanna know what's hard? Fighting the United States and her allies. You wanna know what's also hard? Conducting a combined arms over the horizon amphibious operation. You wanna know what's *really* hard? Doing both at the same time. 

While the PLA could certainly manage one or the other - if the PLA opts to commit amphibious forces to Taiwan before the US's Operational System has been sufficiently degraded/destroyed to where they are unable to meaningfully contest PLA forces within the first, and are unable to achieve parity at the second chain - the PLA will be forced to divert logistical, aerial, administrative (you'd be surprised how valuable admin staff are in wars), intelligence, etc. etc. capability away from US forces and towards the newfound land component. Furthermore, by conducting this amphibious operation without having rolled back US forces, the amphibious operation itself will have fewer supporting assets upon which to rely. 

If you need any more reason than that as to why it would be overwhelmingly advantageous for the PLA to first gut and neuter, then isolate and insulate, and only then to degrade and invade - I don't mind shedding more light on the topic. Just let me know specifically what you contest.",5d25253ba4cde188e43c63dc4e76cb64943c8866,True,False,,,,,0,1653646809,,0,{},ia6d9cm,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia68cd4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia6d9cm/,1653646823,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653618009.0,

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"Ukraine and Taiwan are incomparable for a great many reasons. One of these reasons is that unlike Ukraine, Taiwan doesn't really stand a chance. Ukraine possessed one of the, if not the most capable military of any western-aligned European power (which to be fair, isn't saying a ton), has an enormous amount of strategic depth to retreat into, has an enormous land border with friendly countries through which it can be resupplied, and has been/is being provided with ample intelligence, planning, and personnel training support by NATO. Taiwan has none of these things.

Ukraine was facing a horrifically shoestring-funded, poorly trained, institutionally corrupt shell of a military which served primarily as a symbol of national prestige and a vector by which unsavory types could line their pockets. Russia has still been unable to generate, employ, and sustain its airpower at a remotely appreciable scale and to anything resembling a meaningful effect. Russia has conducted bafflingly inept operational-level planning and execution, and started off the conflict with a strategic vision seemingly drawn up by a RusMOD covering its eyes, stuffing its ears, and going ""lalalalalalala I can't hear you!"" to any objections as they roleplayed the part of competent field grade officers. None of these things are true of Taiwan, nor of the enemy they face. 

However, most importantly, Ukraine *had nothing to give*. At best, they had the Donbas; but had the Russian attempt at completely decapitating the Ukrainian state, and destroying the Ukrainian military in the field been successful, offering up the Donbas as Russian troops traipsed about Maidan Square would be, obviously, quite redundant. Taiwan on the other hand, *does* have something to offer - and more importantly - the ability to take it away. 

Thus, I don't see how the two situations are in any way able to be meaningfully compared. 

&gt;Quite a few, been many times, lived there some years

I find this incredibly surprising. In my years residing, and many more partaking in the social ecosystem of the mainland, I had never once heard anyone speak of their need for the CCP stemming out of a lack of morals in the average Chinese citizen, or really anything of the sort. I know you said that it's an exaggeration, but it's simply too large of one to be taken seriously. It'd be akin to me saying ""We need freedom in the USA because I don't trust american politicians not to pass a law saying police officers can break down my door, rape my wife and children, and kill my dog!"" While there's truth to the American psyche seeking a more lasseiz-faire system of governance due to fear of government overreach, I'm sure you can see how that basic premise is muddied with a quote like the one above. 

Similarly, the mainland view that the CCP is an instrument of preventing corruption and keeping everyone in line is a fairly reasonable view, but a statement like yours muddies it beyond being worth discussion. Furthermore, it *is* the case that the CCP has clamped down on and been successful in their anti-corruption efforts. No system is immune to corruption, and having a capable arm of that system which actively prevents it from taking root and spreading - I would say is an overall net positive. Funny enough, if there were anti-corruption efforts put underway in the US, I'd be very much in support of it. Instead, we just legalize it and call it ""lobbying"" and ""campaign donations"" lol. 

I will say though, folks who fled during Mao's rule (and especially during the cultural revolution) do indeed have a noticeably more negative view of the CCP, and for good reason. I don't think anyone can be faulted for living under Mao and coming out with a less-than-rosy view of such a system. 

&gt;Dictatorships are great until they aren’t.

Yeah pretty much. There's that old quote that ""The theoretically best, most efficient government is found in a benevolent dictatorship -- yet in practice, dictators are seldom benevolent."" While I have to begrudgingly acknowledge that the CCP has, since Deng, been surprisingly competent; I absolutely and wholeheartedly agree that the actions they have taken in the furtherance of their (ultimately well intentioned and successfully implemented) agendas can easily be transformed into an instrument by which a more malicious CCP could do an enormous amount of damage to what they've achieved thus far.

For as well as China is doing (and will continue to do, potential doomsday-event level catastrophes notwithstanding), the plateau is beginning to enter their sight. They're certainly going to keep growing for the foreseeable future, even despite their demographic issues (which, by the way, I find really impressive how much they are overstated, and how quick people are to ignore our own and our partner nations' similar challenges), but they may begin to slow down in the near future. 

This, combined with an increasingly hostile ""major power"" ecosystem *does* present some notable difficulties that China will have to face in the next 5-10 years. Most saliently, how does it intend to keep growing once it has achieved a ""moderately prosperous"" state (at which, the Chinese economy will likely be between 2 and 3 times its current size, at an approximately stable 1.1-1.2B citizens, and at a per capita GDP of between 150,000 to 200,000RMB)? This is likely to be reached in the next 10-15 years, and avoiding a major ""plateau"" to growth is something the CCP will be forced to confront when it occurs.

Furthermore, how does the PRC intend to handle the ""re-integration"" of Taiwan? I find it fairly difficult to believe that Taiwan would willingly (that is, knowingly choose without a threat of force) to integrate into the PRC if they were not offered favorable and conciliatory terms for doing so. 

Could a Taiwan which was guaranteed autonomy, only had a limited troop presence, was allowed to keep its own democratic government, and was not subject to much of the PRC's censorship and authoritarianism apparatus be a thing if China were to grow well beyond the US? Maybe.

&gt;Also 10-15 years set back is stretching it

Nah, it's pretty much on the money. The difference is, the last 10-15 years haven't seen the most spectacular of growth in cutting edge semiconductors compared to the 10-15 years preceeding lol. For 15 years, 2007 would put us at like, 30nm? For 10, we're practically still at 14nm lol - given that Intel (as you said) adopted the process in 2014. Given that the overwhelming majority of sub-14nm chips are produced by TSMC (sure technically intel's ireland fab and samsung's operations produce down to like 5nm or something, but they're a pretty insignificant part of that ""ultra fine process"" market compared to TSMC, who absolutely dominates it), it would make it pretty tough to find semiconductors in supply under 14 to 20nm. 

Sure, a lot of the technical know-how would still exist for how to make EUV machines and whatnot, but TSMC holds some fairly juicy trade secrets on how exactly to design and manufacture chips using that equipment that just can't be reimplemented overnight. It would take years to begin mass producing sub-14nm chips at the scale TSMC could do it, and it would also take years to re-work our way down to where we are now in chip scale. We'd certainly compress those 10-15 years of development to perhaps 4-5 years, maybe less if extraordinary financial/governmental/etc. backing were provided, but it would still have an enormous impact for those years, and would make much of our state of the art computing tech un-procurable (especially consequential for the AI/ML, physics, and other similar sectors that rely on enormous amounts of compute power for their research

This does not seem like something a Japanese politician would say to a foreigner about another Japanese politician, even if they are a political opponent. Accepting blame for shameful past actions is actually something they’re culturally bad at. And for once I actually have a decent reading recommendation on this point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_(Murakami_book)

I’m not going to paint myself as an expert on all things Japan, but such a statement seems, really, really, really out of character for them. This is a society where people who are the victims of national disasters get bullied and fired from their jobs because their presence reminds people of a public embarassment. 

&gt; China would immediately support them under United Front strategy

I think you overestimate how useful that support would be to a political faction. I’d actually worry that the most likely result of the support would be a xenophobic backlash.  

&gt; The most clear examples are dynastical transition affecting Korea as Korea is closer.

Sure but I wasn’t asking about Korea, I was asking about Japan. You made a broad assertion that everyone in asia scrambles when chinese dynasties change, and I pointed out I can’t think of a single shift in power in Japan in the last several centuries that was triggered by a chinese dynasty change, which isn’t surprising given Japan’s strict isolationist policy in that time period. 

&gt; The loyalists to the old dynasty and the new comers are now watching and calculating.

Loyalists? Come on, Abe can barely conceal his hatred for Americans, so to call him loyal to America is a bit rich. This reads a little bit like fanfic, frankly, and maybe you’re assuming that Japanese and Chinese people think alike, when we have ample evidence they differ significantly.

Destroying their own fabs would also be somewhat unproductive for Taiwan to do, even out of spite. They can serve as useful bargaining chips in peace negotiations, and provide a way for Taiwan's economy to re-float itself following a conflict. It's a lot easier to say ""Hey China, so it's pretty rough over here, we see that Hong Kong has it pretty good ~~compared to Xinjiang~~, can we please be like them if we surrender now?"" when you can tack on a ""if you let us, we'll keep TSMC intact, help ensure the tech-base and equipment is restored and usable, and will merge with SMIC so that mainland chipfab becomes unparalleled... but also if you wanna make us a Xinjiang-esque PAP-saturated police state, we can just take TSMC down with us.""

Most PRC citizens are supportive of the current government not because it serves as a ""parent"" for their own morally deficient childishness, but because - despite its myriad of flaws - it has delivered economic growth and increase in quality of life on a scale and at a pace we've never really seen before in history. They went from being poorer per-capita than some subsaharan african nations to being the largest domestic economy in the world, possessing the largest PPP (debatable relevance, but in measuring domestic productivity and domestic economic conditions, I view it as an appropriate metric) adjusted GDP in the world, and have experienced a vast amount of other improvements since 2000 that really cannot be compared to any Western experiences. Most mainlanders are okay with some of the more authoritarian aspects of the government not as a result of some weird ""follower-race"" ridiculousness, but simply because it has gone very very well for them so far, and there is a genuine argument to be made that a strong central government does its own share of positive traits that can in some circumstances make it preferable to a more liberal democratic form of government (most notably in infrastructure, in which China leads the world).

The debate that I've seen is on whether or not that semiconductor capability is so coveted by the CCP that it constitutes a significant factor in their Taiwan policy and and their plans for conflict.

&gt;Some of the conclusions made are that a threat to destroy TSMC facilities and erasure of the most critical and trade-secret-esque data held by it would be a serious deterrent factor to the PRC. Some even go so far as to envision a ""D-Day""-esque campaign conducted against Taiwan with the principal axis of conflict being an amphibious one. This is, as a result of the chip-based theory, in order to minimize the duration and resulting damage of the war such that Taiwanese infrastructure, etc. can be captured intact as opposed to standing atop their rubble.

The entire chip theory has only even gotten credence in the last few years due to COVID supply chain issues and TSMC really surpassing a struggling Intel. 

Intel had been either close to or leading processes for a long long time. They hit 14nm with Broadwell in 2014 - then they got stuck on 14nm (granted, constantly refined) for the past 7-8 years.

It's seriously annoying seeing a century of history of WHY Taiwan matters to China - and why China matters to even some Taiwanese (like those descendants of Mainlanders who came over with Chiang Kai Shek) all reduced to ""hey check out these TSMC chips we just learned about during COVID""

Also 10-15 years set back is stretching it. As I mentioned, even with Intel's struggles, it hasn't been anywhere near 10 years since they were at least on some level of parity with TSMC in some areas, and their new leadership seems to have finally turned things around 

&gt;Whether you agree with their view or not, I think downplaying the sheer significance of the factors I've laid out is tantamount to ignoring what is likely the single most overwhelming driver of China's desire to conquer Taiwan. History.

Exactly. People don't understand that Taiwan represents a history of colonialism (both from European explorers during the Age of Exploration, and the culmination of European + Japanese imperialism in the 1800s when Taiwan was ceded to Japan after the first Sino-Japanese War) at a time when China - once one of the ""premiere"" civilizations (certainly one proud of its inventions, wonders, etc. that could rival any of the great ancient civilizations) - was ruled by the Qing Dynasty, itself considered outsiders to the Han Chinese.

And right when China was treated somewhat equal again in world affairs - due to its participation in WW2, and when Taiwan was ""handed back"" to China as part of the conclusion of WW2 - the view of many Mainland Chinese is that the final victory to reunify China, under the banner of the PRC, was denied when the US basically made an invasion impossible.

And so the Chinese don't even view Taiwan as an external affair - they view continued US/Japanese/Western threats of intervention in the same way they view their ""Century of Humiliation"" - a constant reminder that powerful outside forces are intervening in your country's internal affairs.

And right or wrong, that point of view can make sense. Ever since Deng's reforms, China has more or less viewed Western opposition to its rise as a ""you got yours and now you won't let us get mine""?"" Think about their own thoughts on some climate agreements as ""so after centuries of colonialism, pillaging other nations for resources under force, and polluting the world with industrialization, you want to stop us from modernizing our country by restricting us from doing these same things with peace"" - so unsurprisingly, they see it as deeply hypocritical.

&gt;In my view the most dangerous moments in the Ukrainian war -- so far, anyway -- came in the initial couple weeks or so when it was initially unclear what the Western response would be

Ehhh, maybe per popular sentiment, but in the industry, there wasn't really too much concern over that aspect of things. People certainly were concerned that Ukrainian defenses were simply spritely, short lived affairs that provided a speed bump to be slowed down by and progress on from, rather than a brick wall / giant thorn bush for Russian maneuver formations to slam into and get entangled by.

The US had stressed, *well* before the beginning of the invasion (even including a statement by Biden that, ""I will not send American servicemen to fight in Ukraine, we have supplied the Ukrainian military equipment to help them defend themselves."" 

While Biden does sorta have his ""lol oops, let's walk that back in the press release"" moments sometimes, this was a policy position that was very strongly solidified by the time we saw those first blasts in Kharkiv on the 24th. Don't make the (pretty easy to fall into tbh, so don't think I'm taking shots at you or anything, lotsa folks do it) mistake of conflating people on social media with the professional consensus held by folks working in the field. I promise you, the two are *rarely* congruent. 

Responding to your points on Russia:

\&gt; Point 1:   
Well, that's not what I meant to say, if you're implying you took that away from my post. What I meant is that, had Putin viewed US intervention as a genuine possibility - the scope and scale of the campaign would likely have been far more limited, and much death and destruction would likely have been avoided. Ironically though, launching such a disastrous ""full front"" operation may have ended up costing the Russian Forces much more than a confined, relatively ""limited"" operation would have - so perhaps there's a weird upside-down argument to be made that strategic clarity worked by incentivizing overreach. 

\&gt; Point 2:  
Eh, I wouldn't say we care any more about Ukraine than we did on February 23rd. Certainly the popular sentiment has overwhelmingly united behind Ukraine, and the average person feels far more positively about Ukraine than they may have before all this - but the strategic value of Ukraine has not changed. What *has* changed is the overall conceptualization of Russian military capabilities. 

Within, at least, the portion of the IC I happen to be a part of - the Russian military was viewed as highly flawed, monstrously inefficient, but still deadly. Those first two beliefs remain, but the latter has changed. While they're almost certainly killing large numbers of Ukrainians (So long as it impact near enough, a 2S19's 152mm shell, or an M-21OF rocket will kill and maim no matter how much of a goofball the guy pressing the big red button may be) -- their absolute, abject, and astonishing level of incompetence has turned them from a force assessed as able to overrun the Baltic states in a matter of hours/days, and generate tens if not hundreds of thousands of casualties along the Suwalki Gap in a RU-NATO conflict... to a force essentially begging for the Iraq '91 treatment in the eyes of those I work with. 

This fact, accompanied by Ukraine's surprisingly competent conduct, has given Ukraine a very particular utility: They will take our land-based equipment (principally developed, procured, and fielded for the purpose of killing Soviets/Russians and destroying Soviet/Russian equipment), and kill Russians and Russian equipment with it - all without the US ever having to shed a drop of its own blood. 

I might not be a huge fan of Ukraine at a face level, but I certainly do support them in this conflict. With that in mind, I hope you can recognize that the US/NATO assistance that Ukraine has received has been more due to Russian incompetence putting Ukraine in a position where they can (and will!) kill lots of Russians for us if we send them equipment, than due to a heartfelt or ""values-based"" desire to assist a friend in need. 

Responding to your points on Taiwan:

\&gt; Point 1:

Well, sometimes, sure. Right now the principal purpose of strategic ambiguity over the Taiwan situation is to do the following:

\- Prevent Taiwanese overreach and/or crossing of Beijing's ""red lines"" as a result of US overtly pledging military support to Taiwan

\- Avoid provoking Beijing by directly, overtly jeopardizing a core security and policy interest of theirs. As much as we all know what's up - it's the ""saying it out loud"" part that really puts Beijing in a position where they might decide blood is the preferred recompense

\- Prevent incentivizing a Chinese invasion or other hostile action directed at Taiwan by underselling our commitment to Taiwanese sovereignty, or by insinuating that we will not interfere in a Taiwan conflict

\- Maintain a belief within regional partner nations that the US is and will be for the foreseeable future, the dominant player in the Western Pacific, so as to incentivize nations to align with the US. This necessitates providing a degree of security, which would be invalidated should the US either fail to come to Taiwan's aid in the event of a conflict, or should the US outright deny Taiwan aid (which would lead to a conflict).

Covering all of those bases is an extremely difficult task, and having to straddle all of those different red lines, partnerships, and expectations is no small feat. There currently does not exist a foreign policy alternative to Strategic Ambiguity that enables us to meet all of those goals. 

\&gt; Point 2:

I'd actually say that in this case, you seem to be overvaluing public opinion. I know that as a democracy it's sort of taboo to say ""lol fuck what the people think,"" but in national security and military matters: lol fuck what the people think. 

Ultimately, keeping our options open allows us vastly more leeway in how we choose to respond to a Taiwan-crisis than if we were to cement our position ahead of time. Were we to overtly state ""We will not come to Taiwan's aid"" we would, as mentioned previously, put some serious strain on our Pacific partnerships, and would practically invite Beijing to pull the trigger. However, by committing overtly to a response, we would be leaving ourselves open to sub-conflict measures the PRC can take (if we commit militarily to Taiwan's sovereignty no matter what, what happens if the PRC invades or blockades Kinmen or Matsu? What if they launch a series of standoff strikes? What if they threaten and posture for war, but don't actually do it, leading us to overwork our already overworked ships and sailors (and airmen, soldiers, etc. etc. yadah yadah), what if when they invade, we are *seriously* outmatched and in a uniquely bad position just at that time?). Furthermore, either of the two options practically ensures conflict. The *only* way in which the US does not end up in a war with China *sharpish* is by allowing the status quo of ""uhhhh we like, definitely recognize Taiwan as part of China, and we recognize the People's Republic of China as the real China, we just like... we're gonna sell your island some boats and guns and shit since we understand there's a war on, and we don't want any cross-strait violence right now, but we super duper promise we're not backing their independence"" to continue, such that the US and partner nations can maintain their ""commitment to the Rules Based International Order"" and the PRC can maintain their commitment to ""Reunification"" without the two directly opposing agendas chafing too harshly upon eachother.

\&gt; Point 3:

Yeah, I agree. We're in for a ***really really*** shitty 5-8 years. The PLA is going to abjectly surpass us in every conceivable metric in the Indo-Pacific during this time period, we are going to reach the lowest state of capability we've had since like... Vietnam, and most of our remedial efforts (Connies, Hypersonics, OASuW increment, BlkIII Burke/DDG(X) volume production, MQ-25s, BlkIV F-35, etc. etc. etc. etc.) won't take real hold until the *very* late 2020s, into the early 2030s.

Sure, maybe in 1235 they thought that way, but the Chinese are frankly still pissed about WW2, and Japan hasn’t, is unlikely to ever really apologise for what they did.

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"The sealift assets necessary to transport 2-4 Brigades from 72nd and 73rd GA will be assembled in Fujian and Guangdong, where vehicles will be embarked anywhere from \~24-48 hours prior to D-hour. Personnel will likely embark anywhere from 8 to 12 hours beforehand, and will be briefed on their specific objectives at this point. Anywhere from 2 to 4 hours prior to landings, a surge in UAS, rotary-wing, and fixed-wing sorties will begin to provide the landing force ample supporting fires should significant resistance materialize; and ""bandwidth"" indirect fire (""bandwidth"" fires refers to fires generated at the absolute maximum pace and scale possible) will begin shaping landing beaches, bombarding diversionary targets, and engaging targets of opportunity as cued by the myriad of reconnaissance platforms operating over/around Taiwan.

As ship-borne amphibious forces reach \~20-30km from the shore, they will begin debarking their forces into the water to conduct an over-the-horizon landing (one of the capabilities provided by PLAGF amphibious IFVs/APCs/SPGs. This would occur in tandem with the 1-2 Brigades on Penghu going ""feet-wet"" and beginning the crossing to their own landing positions. PLAAF Airborne Corps forces will have embarked and transited most of the way to their drop-zones by this point; and PLAGF air-mobile forces will also begin transporting their troops to LZs adjacent strategic objectives. 

PLAGF Air-mobile and airborne forces will likely be tasked with securing minor, but force-amplifying objectives such as the passenger terminal/port facilities at Budai and Dongshi, preparing FARPs for further air-mobile forces to be airlifted across the strait, securing minor airfields and/or preparing their own improvised airstrips, and to cause confusion and shock among any ROCA land forces believed to still be active. Note, this air-deployable force is comprised of 6+ Brigades, or 40,000+ troops, so it is hardly a ""raiding"" force similar to the sort seen in Ukraine. 

As the airborne/air-mobile forces begin to secure their objectives, the force from 73d GA will likely land somewhere in the north/central western portion of the island, and will likely be tasked with securing and preparing the port facilities West/Southwest of Taichung for the task of offloading further forces. Securing this set of objectives will likely occur within 1 to 3 hours of the landing, with repairs and additional structures for receiving follow on forces to be sufficiently complete within 24-48 hours.

The force from 74th GA will likely land in central western Taiwan, with the objective of capturing and beginning repairs on the major port west of Mailiao Township, as well as maneuvering farther inland with ""tripwire"" forces, both to gauge the disposition of locals - as well as to generate the needed ""depth"" for their forces to absorb any potential ""push"" the Taiwanese may somehow be able to materialize (I find it unlikely to happen, but per PLA doctrine, this prophylactic measure would likely still be taken). The port will likely be taken within 1 to 2 hours of the landing, and will likely be functional enough to assist in offloading forces and logistics materiale in 12-24 hours - with full functionality being restored within 1-2 weeks. 

The force from 72nd GA will likely land in southwestern/south-central western Taiwan, with the aim of further reinforcing any airborne/airmobile forces operating south of the 74th GA force, capturing and restoring ports (again, such as Budai's passenger terminus) so that follow on forces can offload in that ""region,"" and pushing farther inland along the North bank of the Bazhang River. 

These forces create a ""Northern Screen"" of 73rd GA forces along the Dajia River North/Northwest of Taichung, or if resistance is unexpectedly ~~existant~~ fierce - it can be rolled back along the Wu River south of Taichung. A ""Southern Screen"" is created through the 72d GA forces along the Bazhang as stated, and further ""deep"" screen forces - projected farther inland with the aim of creating depth, complicating enemy maneuver, and seizing critical terrain/facilities (such as airfields) - is created by 1 to 2 Battalions from each force, as well as any relevant airborne and airmobile forces with objectives farther inland. These forces are also arrayed along natural choke points, obstacles, or other terrain that forces the remnant ROCA forces (which are likely strongest along these northern and southern flanks, hence the deployment disposition we chose in our modeling) to expose themselves to strategic and organic battalion/company UAS fires or cueing of indirect fires, and to rotary wing/fixed wing forces supporting the landing. 

These ""screens"" - as per PLA doctrine, create a ""shield"" for the 74th GA's force to operate within as it secures the main offloading port and works with relevant airborne/airmobile forces to establish FARPs on Taiwan, allowing for further transport of light forces (High Mobility Combined Arms Battalions sure are handy). Within 24 hours, the northern and southern flanks will be held by \~1-2 Amphibious Brigades + 1-2 Airborne/Airmobile brigades, the central ""sector"" will comprise of 1-2 amphibious brigades, potentially 1 airborne/airmobile brigade, and any follow on forces that arrive within those 24 hours. The ""inland-most"" forces would likely be as far east as the central mountain range, but would primarily have served to ""clear"" through the Western plains, gauge local reaction to PLA forces, and generate that aforementioned depth for PLAGF forces to operate within.

48-72 hours after the initial landings, supposing Taiwan does not outright surrender, further 4-8 Brigades from 72/3/4th GAs are capable of deploying to Taiwan proper, and airbases within the ""central"" sector of operation would likely be secured, which would allow a larger volume of forces and equipment to be transported to the island. 

72+ hours following the initial landings, the PLA will have the forces on Taiwan necessary to secure the rest of the island - even the cities. With \~12-16 Brigades of PLAGF forces, additional PLANMC landings, and all the supporting fires a boy could ever want (with further forces being deployed/deployable as needed), the starving, demoralized, exhausted ROCA remnants would likely be unable to resist a semi-competent maneuver campaign across the rest of the Island.

The initial amphibious operation would likely incur anywhere from 500-1500 casualties over the first 4-8 hours, assuming significant resistance presented itself. Once the ""shield"" is established and the ""central sector"" of operations has been secured (likely within those first 24 hours), a total of 1000-2000 casualties is reasonable to project (again, as a fairly high estimate, assuming significant resistance presents itself), and the follow on ""conquest"" phase would likely add up to a grand total of anywhere from 3500 to 5000 PLA casualties if significant resistance presented itself.

While this fact is obviously understood, since even Ian ""The gag of Patchwork criticizing him with middle name quotes is getting old"" Easton has a functioning set of eyeballs - the differences in terrain are seemingly not. For some reason, and I truly do not know why, it is common to ascribe the same highly vertical, very rocky, and highly complex terrain present in the east to the west coast as well, despite it *abjectly* not being the case.

The West coast, approximately 80%, closer to 85%, has beaches easily shallow enough for amphibious vehicles to debark onto; and the Western side of the island is overwhelmingly flat, rural, and non-complex (referring to complex-terrain, not like... the complexity of irrigation or construction in the area or anything lol). There *are* large amounts of ""fortifications"" in the form of concrete piles along much of the beach, which is likely how Easton determined them to be unsuitable for landing - as, indeed, a million-man-swim style landing at the outset of a conflict would have a very challenging time negotiating such obstacles; but they are utterly trivial for a combined arms, mechanized force supported by engineers, shaped by airpower, and provided ample indirect fires in the event that starved, demoralized, and vulnerable ROCA troops want to take a potshot at the landing force before being, as the youth put it, ""sent to the shadow realm"" by a hail of autocannon, actual cannon, machine gun, indirect, rotary wing, UAS, and potentially fixed wing fires tasked solely with supporting landing forces.

Can the PLA pick any time, and any place they want and land multiple brigades of forces there? No. Absolutely not. They *are* subject to weather and terrain constraints. However, they can land on the *overwhelming* majority of the West coast; and portions of the East coast are suitable as well. Any concentrated defense would be subject to a tear-jerking amount of prophylactic, suppressive, and lethal fires from a myriad of supporting platforms; and any defense would be plagued by having dealt with the conditions mentioned far above that will have been inflicted upon the ROC forces. Easton is just, as always, a goober.

3 - No, the US will not and can not ""just"" dunk on the landing force/air force/mainland

This one will be shorter, since it's the most outwardly egregious of misunderstandings. There is a strange misconception that we maintain, at least at most times, superior combat power in the near periphery to the PRC; and that we are capable of fighting them with the assets in theater until reinforcements arrive. This is *not* the case.

7th Fleet is a deterrence force, not a fighting force. Currently, we have CVN-76, DESRON-15 (5-8 DDGs depending on circumstance), and 3 CGs (soon to be retired, as we are rapidly phasing them out of the surface fleet) forward based at Yokosuka. We can also count on 6-10 modern DDGs (depending on how classify them), and a handful (10-12) less-than-modern DDGs courtesy of the JMSDF. Readiness for the JMSDF is slightly worse than the USN due to personnel shortages and lower personnel quality; but for arguments' sake we can assume all vessels of all of these forces are deployed simultaneously (which will never, ever happen. ever.).

This indeed appears to be a sizable force - and it is! However, this is the part where people fail to grasp the sheer enormity of the PLA's anti-shipping complex. Assuming the forces follow their traditional deployment behaviors and operate near or within the First Island Chain, they are utterly and completely unsurvivable in the face of PLA anti shipping fires. The PLANAF alone (I'm happy to send some neat infographics I've helped create via DMs) can generate 3-400 YJ-83s, and 150-200 YJ-12s in a single salvo out at Yokosuka ranges (which itself is about as far away as a port facility *can* be from the mainland); and PLAN/PLAAF forces can potentially double that number depending on disposition and individual vessel armament. Even assuming every single one of those vessels were operating as an aggregated formation, at general quarters, and with ample sleep - a salvo of that scope is simply not defendable.

No amount of crew prowess, no matter how advanced the combat systems, and no threshold of valiant damage control can prevent the cold, ruthless calculus of the situation from reaching its horrific conclusion. This, alongside the rest of the air/seapower local to the region (which, unlike this fairy-tale scenario will most certainly *not* be operating all at one time, and will likely be attacked during a local minimum in presence - given that the PLA gets to determine the start of hostilities), is simply not enough to confront and overcome the absolutely gargantuan amount of combat power which the PLA is able to bring to bear in their own backyard.

Which, finally, brings me to the conclusion (in retrospect, more like the halfway-mark LOL...) of this veritable treatise on academic ""We're fucked""-posting. The landing. 

Following a rollback of US and US-aligned forces from the first, and potentially the second island chains (depending on a number of factors, including luck); and once Taiwan has been deemed amply weakened by the maelstrom of operational fires, the horrific aforementioned quality of life due to the (also aforementioned) crippling of critical infrastructure, and an enormous amount of degradation inflicted upon the ROCA defenders, the PLA will likely initiate amphibious operations in earnest. 

The work I've done with other has largely included large, comprehensive preparatory exercises by 73d and 74th GA, and potentially the 72nd during the air/naval phase of operations, so as to prepare land component forces for the operations to come. The PLAAFAC and PLANMC would also likely exercise for a similar purpose. 

During the initial phase of the conflict, it is likely that Kinmen, Matsu, Pratas, and other minor outlying islands would be captured; and once those islands had been secured - and the PLA had been able to ""stress-test"" their JOTHL (Joint Over the Horizon Logistics) and Combined-Arms amphibious capabilities (including any time needed to iron out kinks) - they would begin an operation to take the Penghu archipelago, less than 50km from Taiwan proper. This would likely be a somewhat larger operation, involving significant air-mobile, and likely PLANMC (potentially supplemented by no more than 1 Amphibious CABde from 73GA) forces, conducted as much for strategic reasons as to serve a ""dress rehearsal"" role for the main invasion. The minor islands would likely fall in the course of a day, and Penghu would likely be de-facto ""PLA safe ground"" in 24-72 hours, depending on the forces committed and the hard-headedness of the few defending forces. 

Smaller-scale sealift operations would likely begin once the island is deemed secure, and large amounts of PLAGF artillery platforms (of all kinds - truck-mounted, rocket, self propelled, towed), PLA logistics forces, PLA rotary wing aviation, and other assets will be redeployed to Penghu, which will serve as a major ""forward-operating-base"" of sorts for the main invasion effort. Also deployed will likely be 1-2 Amphibious Combined Arms Brigades (*most likely* from 74GA, as they have the least experience with ship-borne amphibious operations, and 72/73GAs will have gained experience doing just that in their operations to secure the minor islands), 1 or more conventional Brigades (depending on timetables, sealift availability, general progression of the conflict, Taiwanese resilience, and much more), and much of Southern and Eastern Theater Command's air-mobile force. 

Note: ""Scraping"" from GA/Brigades in this fashion would be near impossible in many militaries, due to the combined administrative and operational structure of their forces. However, since the 2016 reforms, the PLA has transitioned to a Joint-Forces-Command style of operational organization, in which theater/axis/objective-focused Joint ""Operational Systems"" (basically an equivalent to US Joint Task Forces, with Joint Forces Commanders, branch-specific components, etc.) are stood up, and branches/administrative formations are responsible for providing and employing their forces to and at the behest of the Joint Forces Commander as part of a joint force.",23abd8cad9a52fec572253ee5535ef0bc6da5d52,True,False,,,,,0,1653634772,,0,{},ia5znd3,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia5ia0s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5znd3/,1653634783,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653605972.0,

I certainly agree with your point on what the US will do and when/if/how China conducts itself being up in the air. This is actually sort of huge, and is *way* under-discussed in my opinion. It's baffling that most people just sorta write the situation off as ""oh china's gonna build up their amphibious forces, go all out at T+0, and attempt to land as soon as possible to force a fait-accompli style scenario,"" rather than considering the best paths for *both* sides - not just the US.

Throughout most of my career, most of the folks ""in the know"" whom I've had the pleasure of working and/or discussing the topic with, nearly all agree that the PLA views US intervention as almost certain. The exact course of action, disposition, manner of execution, and timeframe are the most significant sources of debate.

For example, some of the folks I've worked with when modeling potential PLA ""zero-hour"" operations will disagree on whether the PLA believes the US would *immediately* respond to PLA aggression towards Taiwan - with whatever assets happened to be there at the time (i.e. a local commander is empowered to kinetically interdict PLA operations as soon as they see them happen); or whether the US would first make haste to secure the assets in theater, coordinate with partner nations, spin up the legislative apparatus, and only begin kinetic ops after this process is complete and the US has secured what it views as the best starting-condition available given the circumstances. It might not seem significant, but this *hugely* changes not only the balance of power, but also results in massively divergent best courses of action for the PLA to take. The most salient example is whether Taiwan will absorb 45-60% of the PLA's transient fires bandwidth in such a ""zero-hour"" strike, or whether it will absorb nearly 100% of it.

If the US takes its time pulling the starting pistol's trigger, it is the PLA's best course of action to focus on generating and employing the fires needed to utterly cripple Taiwan as swiftly as possible. From this point, the vast majority of combat power can be re-oriented towards conducting operations against the United States and her partners (including pre-empting US buildup with as-prompt-as-possible fires employed against US/partner combat power generation apparatus(es), whatever that may look like after they have met their objectives in Taiwan) while Taiwan is blanketed with UAS surveillance platforms, subjected to constant attacks on targets of opportunity (i.e. ROCA tanks, artillery, trucks, etc.) by helicopter, MRL, and (aforementioned) UAS generated fires, faces destruction of strategic resource reserves (Taiwan imports 99% of their energy, and is not even 30% food self-sufficient, and that's *with* natural gas imports to boost productivity), faces isolation from the global telecommunications sphere (PLA EW capabilities are dizzying, and Taiwan has but *seven* fiber cables, many of which lead to the mainland PRC, connecting it to the internet), and put under incessant propaganda from the PRC.

Only once the hunger, thirst (Taiwanese water purification and waste filtration infrastructure is worryingly vulnerable), lack of access to sanitation (again, waste filtration and modern sanitation infrastructure is sure to be targeted), lack of fuel, lack of *forces* due to PLA aerial/indirect fires bleeding out what remains following the initial operational fires, and low-morale (resulting from the aforementioned factors, the constant propaganda, the swiftness and scope of destruction inflicted upon them, and an already somewhat shaky will/capability to fight) take a sizable toll, will the PLA introduce a land component to the campaign. Buildup of these forces will not occur prior to the conflict, but will occur after it has already kicked off via PLAAF/PLARF/PLAN/PLANAF action; which MASSIVELY reduces the window of time (from weeks down to hours, at most) we have to react.

On the other hand, if the US *is* viewed as intent on getting in the fight as soon as it can, a notably different course of action is the PLA's best choice. Initial operational fires will indeed still be employed against Taiwanese targets; but the initial goal will be to simply ""neutralize"" them, as opposed to outright ""cripple"" them. Instead of a totalistic campaign conducted as swiftly as possible to completely exhaust the list of targets in Taiwan; the campaign will be to degrade and destroy as much of Taiwanese *combat power* as possible in as short of a time as possible. While certainly much more limited in scope, this effectively puts Taiwan out of the fight right off the bat. The remaining 40-60% of fires generation will be directed towards US/partner nation warfighting infrastructure (think Kadena, Guam, whatever unfortunate P-8 happens to be meandering around the South China Sea, literally all of DESRON-15, CVN-76, and the 7th Fleet Cruisers, port and air infrastructure in Japan, and every other major target that contributes to the US and allied ability to generate, employ, and sustain combat power in theater). Once local US/partner forces have been degraded/destroyed, and the US/allies are reeling and scrambling to react, newly freed-up PLA fires generation will be directed again towards Taiwan, but this time in a more substantial scope - encompassing all of the targets put forth prior, and will then merge with the other scenario in that the PLA will assemble amphibious forces, continue to degrade Taiwanese resistance, and only when it views them as sufficiently weakened - invade.

Note: This invasion may look slightly different depending on the initial path the PLA takes as well. Firstly though, I'd like to comment on a couple common pervasive notions I see.

1 - No, Taiwan is not un-invade-able for most of the year. This is a nuisance put forth in large part by Ian ""Hated so so so much by Patchwork Chimera that he rarely goes more than 3 posts without making that fact clear"" Easton in his seminal work ""The Chinese Invasion Threat. While yes, the Taiwan Strait is indeed inclement during much of the Spring and Summer - even famous for killing people who try illegally cross to/from the mainland - it is rarely significant enough to prevent amphibious warships from transiting the strait.

I'd encourage folks to read this paper: [https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/36/7/jtech-d-18-0146.1.xml](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/36/7/jtech-d-18-0146.1.xml)

This, among many other things (and while not being the focus of the study) happens to catalogue and model the ""significant wave height"" frequency in the most hazardous part of the Taiwan Strait. For the overwhelming majority of the time, the sea state is 3-4 (0.25-1.5 meter swells); with particularly rough months usually reaching sea states 5 and 6 (2.5 to 6 meter swells). Sea states 5 and 6 *are* indeed unacceptable conditions to debark amphibious vehicles such as those possessed by PLANMC and PLA Amphibious Brigades, so at a glance it appears sensible. However, these most hazardous parts of the strait are a significant distance from the shore. While conducting a ""D-Day with Ian Easton Characteristics"" (often called the ""million man swim"" in jest) in the form of vast numbers, potentially thousands, of small boats and other asymmetric transports is indeed unfeasible during these conditions - sailing modern, large vessels through these conditions and into the *much* less hazardous waters nearer the shore is unequivocally not. From \~30/40km west of Taiwan to its shores, sea states are *significantly* less hazardous. Even right this very moment, during the height of the ""bad"" weather period (generally considered to be April-May), swells at that range to the shore are vanishingly infrequently above \~1 meter. Thus, the PLA not significantly constrained by weather in their conduct of conventional, non ""swarm-type"" amphibious operations. While a Typhoon, Tropical Storm, or other significant weather event would prevent it; the Taiwanese weakened far more by time than the PLA, who can fairly easily afford to shift timelines days to weeks rearword.

2 - No, Taiwan does not only have ""only a few"" beaches possible to land troops on.

This is (yet) another belief I've seen spread in large part due to Ian ""Patchwork really really wishes this dude would just stop writing, like seriously it's amazing he even has a career after claiming ballistic missiles are \*literally\* no more dangerous than artillery shells, and thus are a non-threat"" Easton's panegyric view of Taiwan.

It *is* true that a non-insignificant portion of Taiwan's coast is mountainous, rocky, and near-impossible to debark a sizable (PLANMC/PLAGF Amphib Bde or larger) force upon in a short timeframe. That part is factual, and I have no qualms with it. However, the ***overwhelming majority*** of terrain matching this description is on the Eastern side of the Island. Very roughly, \~60-80% of the eastern coast is comprised of extremely steep rocky shores, sheer cliff-faces, or terrain completely unsuitable to debark hundreds of vehicles and thousands of troops onto. There *is* still a notable portion of the coast which is workable, mostly in the northern region of the island, and on the periphery of Taitung in the South, but the majority of that coast does not befit a landing force.

[],False,,TEmpTom,,,[],,,,text,t2_6h1tr,False,False,"I don't really agree that nuclear threats are non-credible. They were a quintessential part of NATO's Cold War war fighting doctrine against the Soviet Union due to the immense conventional military advantage the Red Army had in Europe. Even with the abandonment of the Eisenhower Administration's Mass Retaliation Doctrine, and the adoption of Flexible Use, a nuclear war was basically inevitable if the Soviets and the Americans began firing at each other due to the extremely complex system of delegation and sub-delegation for nuclear weapons use during a possible war when communications with the government and even local command outposts were expected to be lost. 

This system of nuclear use hasn't really changed since the Cold War has ended. As the article stated, America will not tolerate sharing the Indo-Pacific with China, and if it sees that the conventional military balance has shifted in China's favor, I can easily see the US incorporating tactical nuclear strikes directly into their Indo-Pacific war fighting doctrine. The impetus to use tactical nukes as purely naval weapons would be even greater due to the ""greater safety"" from escalation into a full-scale thermonuclear exchange if instead a Chinese city was nuked. Tactical nuclear strikes would also make an amphibious landing on Taiwan completely impossible regardless of conventional superiority.

I can easily see both countries settling on an equilibrium similar to the one between the US and the USSR during the Cold War after both sides would have slowly altered their war-plans to incorporate more and more nuclear weapons use until we both recognize MAD. The danger now is that China believes that it can either attack Taiwan and violently upset the Indo-Pacific balance of power either without US interference or that it decisively defeat the US and completely drive it out of the region via conventional war.",58eb859bf6649381fa5a5bdb17de2475583cb293,True,False,,,,,0,1653628131,,0,{},ia5qnkm,False,t3_uyl45a,False,False,t1_ia4sq6o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5qnkm/,1653628145,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653599331.0,

There's another issue here too, I suspect. The Russian narrative is that the Ukrainian leadership are all American puppets. When I look for Russian perspectives, something I see again and again is the idea that Poland is about to invade Ukraine from the West and meet Russia in the middle. It's comical, but I think the kernel of truth in this is that the Ukrainians have a long history of being subjugated by empires, and a strong preference for their current experience of governing themselves.

So I think that western countries are likely going a bit out of their way not to inject personnel into leadership decisions like that because it's kind of insulting and concerning to people with Ukraine's history.

The thing that makes me not agree with this is for most of its history Japan have lived in a world where China is the dominant power in the region and they are okay with that. There is no real reason to believe in a China dominated future Japan cannot find its place in the region again and I think the Japanese themselves know this.

However very importantly: the political elites that benefit under an US aligned Japan are not the same political elites that benefit under a China aligned Japan. In order for this transition to work the new group must displace the old, perhaps violently even. We are already seeing signs of this where Abe's crew continue to be hawkish towards China while Kishida's crew are instead hawkish towards Russia and there's endless infighting between them.

Yasukuni Shrine is just a focal point for the old school Abe's crew. Once you go to the shrine you've outed yourself to China as a member of the old group and that group then uses the shrine as a test for loyalty, much like a criminal gang might demand new inductee to have a criminal record so they can't do a turn coat and run to the authorities to save themselves.

This is hardly new for the region. Historically when China experiences a dynastical change this ""changing of the guards"" happens in Korean and (to a lesser extent) Japanese politics, somethings ""encouraged"" by military force from the new Chinese dynasty. In this case it just happens US is the old dynasty while PRC is the new dynasty.

Thus I don't think Japan will have a clear position until this internal conflict is resolved one way or the other. Should US want to reverse this trend the only way is to show actual military prowess and now just talk about it. Year round the Chinese Coast Guard patrols the water around Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Surely that should be covered under article 5 of U.S.-Japan Security Treaty yet the US does nothing. So you can see why some in Japan see this as a sign that a changing of dynasty is nearly upon them.",8de921ab1a3d5679c277c26bc0a799ae0e14b201,True,False,,,,,0,1653626794,,0,{},ia5olx0,False,t3_uyl45a,False,False,t1_ia5adl5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5olx0/,1653626807,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653597994.0,

I will first concede I should not have labeled it ""obscenely rash"" without at least explaining what I meant by that, so let me do so now.

In my view the most dangerous moments in the Ukrainian war -- **so far**, anyway -- came in the initial couple weeks or so when it was initially unclear what the Western response would be, there was some serious public speculation about the possibility of a direct war with Russia, and large majorities initially favoured that outcome in the form of a no fly zone. Followed by criticism of the Biden administration for ""not doing enough"" when it wisely ruled that out.

So, lessons for strategic ambiguity from what is admittedly a very different context:

1.) Putin almost certainly would not have amassed troops to invade Ukraine if he realized what the Western response would be. Put another way, we could probably have deterred the invasion by communicating clearly what we would do in the event of invasion.

2.) We did not do so, in no small part, because we did not realize how much we cared about Ukraine until **after** it had been invaded. Even worse than not knowing Russia, we did not know ourselves. This led to a chaotic and dangerous escalation which was, fortunately, dialed back by the Biden administration. And perhaps, in the rush to dial things back, he went too far the other way by publicly conceding to Russia's threats and ruling out any intervention under any circumstances -- so errors upon errors, if you want to take that particular hawkish interpretation.

And the way I apply this to the Taiwan situation:

1.) Ambiguity increases the chances of strategic errors by the adversary. The *intended* purpose of the ambiguity is to make them more cautious, but as has been seen in Ukraine, an adversary with bad information or bad decision-making or both may just as likely go the other way.

2.) Our own domestic political response to foreign crises is difficult to predict, it seriously complicates how to respond effectively, and an ambiguous situation worsens that by making a badly informed public think that military options are on the table when in fact they're not.

3.) Unlike with Russia, I am not sure time is on our side with China. China is not a declining power dependent on fossil fuel exports. If we are too nervous about provoking China by garrisoning troops in Taiwan in 2022, what does that say about our willingness to come to Taiwan's defense in 10 or 20 years if the balance of power swings further towards China?",29c50ebac9f58d70bfeff4173ceae45da0ce6922,True,False,,,,,0,1653624667,,0,{},ia5l3st,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia5e0yk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5l3st/,1653624678,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653595867.0,

As for the balance between explicit non intervention and an explicit guarantee of security, I think the US is doing a relatively good job of walking a delicate tightrope. 

But also I think that, and this doesn't contradict anything you said, China views its conflict against Taiwan as a piece in a broader struggle against the United States. Judging by their action (or lack thereof) China already assumes that the US will intervene kinetically, and will not seriously consider invading Taiwan unless it is confident that it can mitigate the consequences of that. 

What the US will actually do, and when/if/how China will actually invade is obviously something that is still up in the air, so I think it's pretty hard to predict what exactly ""mitigate"" would actually look like. Does this mean that China degrades the ability of the US navy sufficiently so that the USN is no longer the dominating naval power, or that China is able to keep economic disruptions of the war to an acceptable level, or somewhere in between? On the reverse side, what would a Chinese defeat look like and what consequences would that have for the world?

The only slight disagreement I have is that IMO the loss of US ""credibility"" would be even more damaging than semiconductor chips (even if China does manage to capture the infrastructure intact) if the US intervened and was not successful in either stopping a Chinese invasion or imposing costs so high that any victory would be pyrrhic.

There's definitely some debate on whether or not the semiconductor situation is overblown, but I think most of the published material is really on the PRC's ambitions vis-a-vis Taiwan. It's pretty universally acknowledged that losing the Taiwanese fabrication infrastructure and knowledge base, as well as (if the war escalates to a regional conflict) the infrastructure in other nations like SK or JP would be absolutely disastrous. Like, sets-us-back-10-to-15-years level bad. The debate that I've seen is on whether or not that semiconductor capability is so coveted by the CCP that it constitutes a significant factor in their Taiwan policy and and their plans for conflict. 

There's a camp that pretty much goes over the same stuff that I did and concludes a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be, in no small - and probably in quite large - part driven by the desire to secure the semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure in Taiwan. Some of the conclusions made are that a threat to destroy TSMC facilities and erasure of the most critical and trade-secret-esque data held by it would be a serious deterrent factor to the PRC. Some even go so far as to envision a ""D-Day""-esque campaign conducted against Taiwan with the principal axis of conflict being an amphibious one. This is, as a result of the chip-based theory, in order to minimize the duration and resulting damage of the war such that Taiwanese infrastructure, etc. can be captured intact as opposed to standing atop their rubble. One of the notable folks in this camp is Ian Easton, who wrote ""The Chinese Invasion Threat"" which is so (unfortunately) discussed in these circles. Note: I hate Ian ""Ballistic Missiles are Overpriced Artillery Shells"" Easton and all that he stands for, and I think he's a laughable excuse for an ""Analyst,"" more befitting the title of panegyrizing neoconservative demagogue. I simply have to acknowledge that his work for P2049 has gained traction is all -- don't mistake it for endorsement. 

The other camp (which I personally am a part of) believes that while it is a non-insignificant consideration that the PRC makes in their planning and policy, that their reasoning is far more wide-reaching and ""principle-based"" than coldly material. I don't know if you read/speak Mandarin, or if you've spent any/much time in the PRC - but there is a great sense of ""injustice"" quite common in many citizens there. A large part of the population sees an international order constructed by, what must be acknowledged as, former imperial powers who attained their status through invasion, conquest, and exploitation. They see US-aligned nations in their backyard, and read about the, again - what must be acknowledged as, forceful assertion of European will upon China during the 19th and early 20th century. They then have seen, for the overwhelming majority of 20+ year olds in China, the absolutely breathtaking amount of progress that China has made since \~1990/2000 and have experienced the exponential leap in quality-of-life that it has provided them, and feel that while it may have its flaws (which, contrary to the trope of the unthinking, wholly-loyal chinaman, are often criticized in private conversation), the CCP has still been overwhelmingly a force for good in their lives. When this is contrasted with the extremely negative view many westerners (including myself before the last 4 or 5 years embarrassingly) hold towards this government, and in many instances, the people themselves - it of course sparks a sense of ""wanting to 'show them' how it really is."" 

Further, when their relatively peaceful rise (all things considered - I don't want to get into too much politics, but I think it's a fairly reasonable assertion that the PRC has been, and continues to be mostly conflict-averse, and has not engaged in wars of expansion or subjugation at a scale anywhere near that of some western nations) is decried as a great evil, and that it must be stopped in spite of the fact that (as previously mentioned) the Chinese population can look out at a world shaped by and molded to benefit Western powers who did \*exactly\* that, and worse, to attain their own state of hegemony; it is fairly understandable how a sense of injustice may be ingrained into the Chinese psyche. 

We can see this in their talk of the ""Century of Humiliation"" and ""The Great Rejuvination of the Chinese Nation."" We can see the ""Fuck you, we're done playing along,"" mentality in their continually hard-headed and often unproductive diplomatic grandstanding/strong-arming on the world stage. There are plenty of other examples, but this is already getting long. Ultimately, the largest ""symbol"" of ""Western injustice forced on China"" is the continued sovereignty of Taiwan. This ***independent*** ***nation*** (before someone calls me a Wumao lol), by its mere existence, is a constant reminder and reinforcement of those grievances I've laid out; and the subjugation/conquest/liberation/reintegration/whatever your personal beliefs lead you to call it - no matter whether you view it as just or not - represents a shift in the global order in which China has finally ""redeemed"" itself in its eyes, and is no longer held under the weight of that sense of hypocritical repression. 

Whether you agree with their view or not, I think downplaying the sheer significance of the factors I've laid out is tantamount to ignoring what is likely the single most overwhelming driver of China's desire to conquer Taiwan.

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,False,"I actually would contest that Strategic Ambiguity is rash, especially when considering it in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. 

Firstly, I don't think it's fair to assert a US policy of Strategic Ambiguity was ever present vis-a-vis Ukraine. Not only was Ukraine not a significant partner nation, but we also stand to lose practically nothing in the event of Ukraine being fully annexed by Russia. Certainly not as much as Taiwan.

We had fairly concretely stated our intent not to involve ourselves kinetically in Ukraine, and thus weren't... well... ambiguous. By openly declaring that we would provide material, administrative, etc. support rather than sending in American troops - that dissolved any sense of doubt (and thus, restraint) in the Russian decision-making-apparatus's mind as to whether or not an invasion would invite NATO participation. I would be somewhat surprised if the invasion would have been as wide-reaching (and thus, as costly) if the US had maintained true neutrality on the matter - and our ""credibility"" (I have little respect for that term, but I think it has a narrow use case in this instance) would have been damaged had we not made clear our intent not to get involved. It's a lot easier to spin an ""American/NATO cowardice"" angle if the option to get involved was still on the table.

In terms of the ""cost"" of losing Ukraine, I really don't think the two are even remotely comparable. Not only is Taiwan practically the global lynchpin of semiconductor manufacturing (without which, our technologically-driven society could not and would not function until tens/hundreds of billions of dollars and years of time were committed to reconstructing it), it also sits at the economic focal-point of the world. Whether we like it or not, the new ""center of the world"" is Asia. While losing influence in, and worsening the security situation for nations like Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, and Hungary is certainly a factor worthy of appreciation - they are practically irrelevant when their contributions are compared to those of Japan, South Korea, India, etc. 

I would argue that a Russian annexation of all of those listed European countries would be less impactful than a Chinese-aligned Japan and/or South Korea. To lose Ukraine alone? Unfortunate, but hardly existential to US global hegemony. As it stands though, Russian incompetence and inability to generate and employ combat power at a meaningful scale have hamstrung what was likely an attempt to ""Belarus-ify"" Ukraine into at best, an attempt to secure Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts for DPR/LPR use whenever this conflict comes to an ""end.""

Secondly, due to those prior considerations, I think it's a fair position to hold that maintaining the status-quo is vastly more beneficial in China's case than in that of Ukraine. 

One of the primary reasons for this being that a China-Taiwan conflict is far more likely to involve the US kinetically than the conflict in Ukraine ever was. Without US/NATO intervention, Ukraine has put up an extremely effective defensive effort and has been able to largely halt the Russian advance - in some cases, driving it back entirely. With material, intelligence, and other ""non-kinetic"" assistance alone, the policy objectives of the United States can be met, and the conflict may still result in a ""win"" for the US/NATO. With Taiwan, this is simply not the case. If anybody needs it, I don't mind writing a bit about exactly why Taiwan is an absolute, utter, and complete write-off if left un-aided; but I doubt it's wholly necessary, as even the most optimistic of assessments puts Taiwanese chances vanishingly low without the US's intervention. 

As a result, we stand to lose a LOT from an outright denial that we will intervene on Taiwan's behalf. This was not so much the case in Ukraine. Even more-so, we don't have *nearly* as much leeway in supplying Taiwan with equipment, training, intelligence, etc. as we have currently in Ukraine - even in the best of cases. Not only is there a large land border between Ukraine and NATO, but US airpower can operate from what are effectively ""bastions"" west of the Ukrainian border, and can provide Ukraine with all manner of information and services without significant disruption. In Taiwan's case, this is not true. Not only is the PLA's Electronic Warfare capability an order of magnitude ""sharper"" than Russia's (including the ability to sever the *seven* cable-links which connect Taiwan to the rest of the world's internet infrastructure), but PLA strike and other platforms will be able to - if not outright threaten and/or destroy aid being shipped to Taiwan - destroy port facilities, rail hubs, and all other relevant transportation infrastructure that would enable supplies to even be received and distributed in the event of war. This is due to their (again) *order(s) of magnitude* more capable system of generating and employing operational fires when compared to Russia.

Therefore, a scenario in which the US doesn't kinetically intervene in a Taiwan contingency is a dauntingly disadvantageous one for the US to put itself in. The only chance the US has at generating a favorable outcome from those initial conditions is for itself to intervene kinetically, and suffer the gargantuan economic and societal ramifications of doing so.

Obviously, this is not - as the youth say - ""cash money.""

The best option for the US is to expend *significant* political and economic effort to prevent these conditions from ever arising in the first place. The best way to do this is... can you guess? Yup, strategic ambiguity. By not overtly stating the US would come to Taiwan's defense, it removes a pretext for invasion from the PRC's playbook, prevents Taiwanese independence aims from growing too lofty (which could ultimately culminate in them ""crossing Beijing's red lines"" - which would result in war), and keeps PLA planners guessing with regards to exactly how the US would play a crisis of that sort. Having already discussed how disastrous an explicit policy of non-intervention would be, I don't think I need to make any more of a case that the flipside is equally undesirable.  

I'm open to any criticism, and welcome further discussion. All this ""policy"" stuff is slightly above my paygrade.

Americans are so obsessed with wonder weapons that it’s concerning. The history of who thinks like that and where it leads isn’t exactly pretty, and the psychology behind it is usually ego driven and childish. That’s not to say that weapons don’t matter, or that which ones matter don’t change. Weapons can be critical, but to paraphrase a movie I like, every weapon has an inherent flaw: the user. Weapons don’t achieve much good outside of strong strategic design making.
&gt; 
&gt; We’re so focused on how great we think our weapons are that even our focus gets focused on the best case scenarios. It leads to us forgetting the basics, and even becoming hostile towards them. Ukraine had a massive numerical advantage and was on the defensive. They are clearly losing, and things like wheeled howitzers with new recruits are not going to matter in dense terrain against long range rocket artillery.
&gt; 
&gt; We can keep throwing in stuff to try to help on the tactical level, but taking a bunch of stuff that’s been barely trained on and getting it through Ukraine and supporting it so that it can work cohesively without plenty of combined arms exercises isn’t going to make a fighting force that can do anything that the previously large, well equipped, well trained and largely experienced Ukrainian forces that are losing would have.
&gt; 
&gt; Russia has plenty of gas, food, and valuable materials. It’s as close to a self reliant country as anywhere else on the globe. It still has good relations with much of the global south, and our misadventure in Ukraine has moved them ever closer to the resource rich and well armed manufacturing powerhouse that is China. Sure, we make fancier stuff in some areas, but plenty of the materials that make that come from Russia and China or places friendly to them.
&gt; 
&gt; How much of a digital advantage are we going to have when most of the worlds chip production, including most of the best of it, comes from areas China can credibly control or destroy them if they choose? Elections are close in Hong Kong, they could flip to China at any time, and they aren’t going to be supplying us with anything if a war breaks out. Besides, where are those manufacturers going to get the Neon to make those chips?
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we can fix our chip supply issues, increase our ship building, get our deep space launch capability properly sorted, sort out our rubber supply issues, check inflation, end the food shortages, reverse how much our economy is taken up by healthcare costs, find ample supplies of rare earth minerals and uranium, ramp up neon and nickel production, get more missiles into service and in numbers, do a better job at affordable ship design than we’ve done in decades, solve the recruiting and retainment issues in our armed forces, and either drill, build, or research a way out of the energy crisis. That will take years, and that’s not counting any of our other priorities, that is a minimum of what we will need to do if we are going to win the economic war and prevent losing the arms race that we’ve all but committed ourselves to.
&gt; 
&gt; Our eurocentrism is showing. India isn’t having any of this, not that they won’t do business with us or take our money if it works for them, but they aren’t turning against Russia. Israel won’t give Ukraine lethal aid. Saudi is thinking about moving away from the petrodollar. In Asia, we’ve basically lost the Solomon Islands, Singapore is moving closer to China, and the Philippines just elected someone who’s a fugitive here in the US largely because he wants to get along with China better.
&gt; 
&gt; We’re so busy personalizing and blaming that we don’t seem to see that much of the world doesn’t agree with our administrations claims of innocence as this hits the global encounter and threatens people with starvation. As if Russia doesn’t want to trade its food. We’ve created a perverse incentive by trying to ruin it economically while it’s in this fight. We are giving them no reason to leave and every reason to stay and take more of Ukraine’s resources. For its part, China has noticed, and they see us trying to case chaos to their north. We’re advertising that they are next.
&gt; 
&gt; We are picking a fight that we aren’t prepared to win, and for much of the world they are going to see this as our fight. John McCain went to Kyiv, where he pushed for revolution along with our ambassador. The revolution was violent, and since then we’ve been eager for NATO expansion while we piled arms into the country and ignored how they violated numerous peace agreements.
&gt; 
&gt; We’re backing a government that’s only controls about half its territory, that has had millions leave, that accomplished nothing with a large army, and that lies to us constantly. Ukraine’s forces aren’t going to beat Russia for us, and we aren’t going to beat Russia and China without a devastating war. This is already hurting us.

Oriana Skyler Maestro is great, and I've actually had good conversation with her myself in the past. However, she does sometimes get a little overly-pessimistic in her views vis a vis the PRC. 

In particular, I would contest that our most critical allies are a toss up in terms of if they get involved. She historically posits a fairly negative view on whether or not JP, AU, and PH would involve themselves in a military conflict between the US and the PRC.

Credit where credit is due, there *is* genuine reason for this: most notably, it would absolutely thrash those nations. Japan for example, as the most pivotal allied nation, would have its trade and economy absolutely obliterated if it were to get kinetically involved between the PRC and the US -- victorious or not.

Northern Theater Command (de-facto responsible for the Korea and Japan threat axes) has the capacity to generate an *eye watering* volume of fires, even out to Hokkaido. From work I've been apart of (I'd prefer not to name names, viva la PERSEC), the staying power of the JMSDF is measured in hours to days - not weeks to months. Most of Japan's airpower generation, critical infrastructure, and combat power generation apparatus as a whole, is liable to be enormously degraded or destroyed in the first 24-48 hours by combined PLARF (Bases 65/66 + other relevant Brigades) and PLAAF fires from NTCAF. Note, NTCAF is where a large portion of the PLAAF's most capable airframes are based, and train especially hard in SEAD, OCA, and miscellaneous strike missions. Thus, as an aside, it should be no surprise that NTCAF Bdes are disproportionally overrepresented in Golden Dart winners. 

As a result of this, Japan would pretty much be on the ropes from the get-go. It imports a very large portion of its energy, relies VERY heavily on imported foodstuffs and miscellaneous materiale for day-to-day functioning of its society, and is acutely vulnerable to the exact kind of threat that the PLA presents. This doesn't paint a pretty picture for if they do choose to get in on the action. 

However, I personally view any US intervention to almost guarantee Japanese participation. Allow me to lay out my reasoning:

The PLA-USA conflict will be *the* defining conflict of the century. World War 1 + 2 + Cold War level of important. If the US decides it's time to punch the metaphorical time card - it will be doing so with *every single advantage it can get*. If the PLA were to attack Taiwan tomorrow (and did not itself strike US assets at T+0), the US would likely not start shooting right off the bat. Rather, the US would be best served by -- quite expediently -- putting together a coalition that can operate jointly, instead of the US's first shots being done in a piecemeal manner. If the US cannot secure support from nations like Japan, I view it unlikely that the US will get kinetically involved in the first place. After all, beyond containing the PRC, the most significant impetus for coming to Taiwan's defense is to assuage allies that the US is committed to regional defense. If these allies do not view Taiwan as existential enough to get involved, it leaves little reason to put American blood on the line in a disadvantageous fight for containment alone. 

Thus, any kinetic US intervention in a Taiwan scenario will necessarily involve the Japanese. Furthermore, more realistically, I would expect that in the event of a PLA campaign against Taiwan, the Japanese *will* view it as existential enough to get involved. Not only will an uncontested campaign against Taiwan result in an overwhelming victory for the PLA (which is destabilizing enough, as a recently successful military looks all the more appealing to use as a coercive measure), but it will also have a myriad of knock on effects on the rest of the world. 

The most salient of these is chip fabs falling into PRC hands, which will result in a practically un-sanctionable Chinese economy, lest the entire modern technological base of the sanctioning country implode on itself. It's really difficult to overstate just how enormous Taiwan is in the global technological economy. Samsung's SK and GlobalFoundries' US plants cannot *hope* to keep supply of even the less advanced nodes stable without tens of billions of dollars and years to decades of maturation and growth. 

Taiwan also serves as a natural choke point in access to the Western Pacific. A notable example is that currently, PLAN SSNs have to transit one of a handful of straits to gain direct access to the Western Pacific from mainland bases. This necessitates traveling through a shallow, hazardous stretch of waters (as evidenced by the Connecticut's recent sea-mount-smooch), and past the South or East China Sea shelf. These shelves are particularly deadly as the bathymetry creates a lot of ways for a SSN to give itself away.  While this serves as a significant benefit in making it *very perilous* for the US to operate SSNs within the First Island Chain (yes, even the Virginias for as neat as they are) - this also makes deploying SSNs and SSBNs to the ""true blue"" WESTPAC a challenge. With the capture of Taiwan, they are afforded a near perfect ""Gateway to the Pacific"" from which the PLAN's SSN and SSBN fleet (JL-2 armed SSBNs at least) can sortie directly into deep, ""safe"" waters. 

Finally, the geopolitical impact of Taiwan falling. As I touched upon, Taiwan's fall to the PRC would be a watershed moment in global politics. Not only would it effectively signal the end to US hegemony in the Western Pacific -- but it would also signal the ascension of the PRC to ""superpower"" status. While it may appear small, this one narrow focal point has gargantuan ramifications on the regional and global balance of geopolitics. More nations would (for the aforementioned economic, as well as sheerly political reasons) begin to shift towards Chinese alignment; it would empower other nations to take military action in attempt to change the status quo (having seen it done successfully in Taiwan's case), and would erode the current established order in the WESTPAC. This also gives credence to my and others' belief that the US would certainly not intervene on behalf of Taiwan without a position of relative parity - as the effects would be an order of magnitude more pronounced were Taiwan to fall *and* the US to lose a conflict with the PRC.

Thus, it is in Japan's (perhaps not SK, due to the Nork presence, and PH due to their peculiar political landscape and somewhat wavering commitment to being a ""treaty ally"" - especially in the wake of their recent elections) best interest - should they seek to maintain their political status quo long-term - to work with and support a US intervention, assuming they are not pre-empted by a season's greeting, courtesy of aforementioned PLA Northern Theater Command; hang the costs.",48b151e80f3f5e0c986b7168b41482ab723f4529,True,False,,,,,0,1653618998,,0,{},ia5adl5,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t3_uyl45a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia5adl5/,1653619016,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653590198.0,

Your whole scenario about African and Middle Eastern countries being caught in a bind due to US pressure had no basis in reality; the US isn't asking these countries not to buy food from Russia, in fact isn't really asking most of them to do anything at all regarding Russia.

Another track was near snake island and it probably covered up to Kherson Mykolayiv, but I don’t think there is a way to put a radar near the Donbas enough to provide Ukraine informations.

These information if given to Ukraine can be used to give indication to sams battery when  and from where a Russian plane is coming, and help to organise fighters sorties so that they don’t engage an enemy superior in numbers.

First, as you point out, I think she does the Cold War a bit of a disservice by suggesting that nuclear threats weren't truly credible. It's certainly true that by the end of the 80s the two sides had settled into a sort of ""rhythm"" that could make war unlikely but a deep history of early crises in the 50s to 60s leaves me feeling lucky, not confident. Certainly large chunks of the military on both sides believed a war would happen eventually, and when it did, it would be a nuclear one.

Secondly, contrary to the idea that we ""let"" Russia have a sphere of influence, I think part of the differential risk with China is that we **successfully contained the USSR** from pretty early on in the Cold War. It was boxed in by the 50s and from there most of the would-be crises were proxy wars in Third World countries. In contrast, China's not contained at all. Sure, Japan and South Korea and the like are pretty stalwart, but there's a vast reach of countries out there that, unlike in the early Cold War, could still end up going either way here.

Also, we didn't spend decades trying to liberalize the Soviet Union with helpful trade policy. That's a sunk cost for new policy and I won't belabour which president made the bigger mistakes in foreign policy there. The point is, unlike the Soviets, this is shaping up as an economic conflict first and a military one third or fourth down the list, and so it's going to look different.

The exception is Taiwan and I think the longer we put off a serious and sober decision on what to do about Taiwan, the more dangerous the situation will be.

&gt; * Militarily, China can operate effectively from its bases. It only asks for neutrality, which is easier politically for regional leaders to grant in the case of a conflict. In all likely contingencies, China plans on fighting only the country directly involved (most likely initiating the attack itself) and possibly the United States if Washington chooses to intervene. But Beijing has worked hard to ensure that other countries, even US allies, remain neutral in any conflagration. 

&gt; * …the sprawling geography of Asia requires power projection across vast distances. 

&gt; * Even two close US allies like Japan and South Korea consistently refuse to work together and broaden meaningful defense cooperation. 

&gt; * China is not the existential or even ideological threat the Soviet Union was. And these partners and allies enjoy great economic benefits associated with continued strong ties with Beijing. These factors make it harder for the US to build a coalition against Chinese aggression. 

&gt; * Economically, the costs of alienating Beijing would be significant for any regional player. The number one trading partner of all US allies and potential partners (like Singapore) is China. Consider Japan, one of the United States' closest Asian allies. In 2018, 23% of imports were from China, and 19% of exports were from China… 

&gt; * But even just looking at the direct competition between China and the United States, Washington has a much harder time with China than it did with the Soviet Union. For example, the ratio of Soviet to American gross national product increased from around 48% in 1961 to just 51% in 1969 (Trachtenberg, 2018). Additionally, during the height of the Cold War, the US spent around 9% of GDP on defense, compared to roughly 3% now (Macrotrends, n.d.). In other words, the US had twice the relative power of the Soviet Union (while China and the US are closer to parity) and dedicated more of its resources to defense than it is now. 

&gt; * Even Southeast Asia countries insist they do not want to choose a side, even as China infringes on their sovereignty in the South China Sea. 

&gt; * European allies are even more reluctant to involve themselves. While during the Cold War, the Soviet Union presented a threat to US allies in both theaters, today, China does not present a real military threat to Europe. Chinese alignment with Russia and its interference in European democracies has heightened European threat perceptions. 

&gt; * China has no real allies that it will defend and has never deployed troops abroad outside of multilateral constructs like UN peacekeeping operations or the Gulf of Aden anti-piracy mission. 

&gt; * …the United States must avoid relying on the same Cold War tools and strategies of competition, even if they were effective decades ago.

A pretty dark picture here from Dr Mastro, but I feel that there is a bit of a lack of appreciation on just how perilous the Cold War was. As stated in the paper the Soviet Union's economy was roughly half the size of the US, but it also spent some 40% of its GDP on defense. And it had a largely conscript military which gave it more manpower for a fraction of the cost. 

And it is true that the Soviet Union did not have much in the way of cyber or space weapons, however this does not mean that it had less grey area weapons. In fact modern day Russia has been using many of the grey area weapons recently, like; assassinations, interference in foreign elections, agitation of extremist groups, deliberate attempts at erosion of public trust in institutions/news/facts, funding and equipping of rebel groups around the world, and more I am sure I am forgetting.

&gt; * US versus China: Promoting ‘Constructive Competition’ to Avoid ‘Destructive Competition’ 

&gt; * This SMA Perspectives paper is focused on the following question: “How should the US manage the US-China relations so that they stay below the level of conflict and destructive competition?” In this context, the paper distinguishes “constructive competition” from “destructive competition.” 

&gt; * In the context of this SMA perspectives paper, “constructive competition” is a “state in which actors see their interests on a particular issue to be in some degree of non-threatening, non- damaging opposition.” It is “tolerable and productive,” and it is “the ideal mode in a dynamic global system, as it stimulates innovation and movement” 

&gt; * “Destructive competition,” on the other hand, is a “state in which actors see their interests on a particular issue to be in opposition and potentially damaging to their respective interests. Tactics consistent with destructive competition can range in severity from international rules violations (e.g., stealing intellectual property) to actions seen as sufficiently harmful to necessitate shows of armed force to signal or demonstrate willingness to escalate. 

&gt; * Maintaining balance among competing interests in international security affairs is both a leadership and a management issue. Major leadership and management objectives include satisfying specific security objectives, while simultaneously 1) avoiding escalation (to the right) on the cooperation-competition-conflict continuum, 2) looking for opportunities to cooperate and compete constructively with long-time partners and competitors alike, and 3) retaining escalation control in the case of destructive competition and conflict. The ideal states are cooperation and constructive competition, given that US security objectives are met. 

&gt; * Thus, the US objective would not necessarily be to “gain advantage,” particularly where cooperation better serves overall US interests. “Gaining advantage” implies asymmetry, which in and of itself is the foundation of destabilizing escalatory security spirals. Rather, the US objective would be to defend against disadvantage and seek to “create dilemmas for the adversary,” if these dilemmas would lead to cooperation or de-escalation, but not if the dilemmas would lead to destabilizing choice options. Key to all this is a viable risk management strategy. 

&gt; * The United States has five treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific, two of which are engaged in territorial disputes with China (Japan in the East China Sea and the Philippines in the South China Sea). 

&gt; * China also backs North Korea economically, politically, and militarily, which threatens US ally South Korea's security. 

&gt; * This is not an unusual position; approximately 80% of wars from 1648 to 1990 were fought over territory-related disputes (Mitchell &amp; Trumbore, 2014; Vasquez, 1995). 

&gt; * …my contribution will focus on **how deterring PRC aggression is more difficult now than during the Cold War.** Deterring and defeating Chinese aggression requires the US to 1) convince Beijing that the costs of using force outweigh the benefits, and relatedly, 2) to forge a counterbalancing coalition of states opposed to PRC regional hegemony, or at the very least, a coalition willing to support the US efforts to defeat any PRC aggression. 

&gt; * The United States never believed it could defend the inter-German border against Soviet aggression without the conflict escalating to the nuclear level. However, both Chinese and American military strategy and planning allude to the belief that conflict could remain conventional and limited, even between nuclear powers. 

Deterrence is “the art of coercion and intimidation” in which “the power to hurt [is used] as bargaining power...and is most successful when it is held in reserve” (Schelling, 2008). 

&gt; * Successful deterrence requires the threat of unacceptable cost to be credible. There are some reasons to believe that credibly communicating such a threat is difficult in the case of China. 

&gt; * First, there is some uncertainty in Beijing about whether the United States has the resolve to fight on its allies' behalf. 

&gt; * There is no effective way to position US aircraft and surface vessels such that China has no choice but to engage US forces when attacking an ally. 

&gt; * Therefore, if China were to use force, it will always be a separate, independent decision on the part of the United States whether to get involved in its partner's defense. 

&gt; * China also has more options for nonlethal but effective uses of force than the Soviet Union did —specifically, in cyberspace and outer space. 

&gt; * …during the Iraq War, the United States used 42 times the bandwidth of the first Gulf War (Talbot, 2004). 

&gt; * It is very difficult to deter attacks in these domains because the benefits are so high— potentially preventing US intervention—and the costs relatively low. Any US threat to impose an unacceptable cost in response is by its nature incredible, given that attacks in cyber and space do not directly result in loss of life. US strategists have given significant consideration to the challenge and have promoted the idea of cross-domain deterrence (Mallory, 2018). But it is hard to imagine a US president authorizing lethal force against China if Beijing has yet to do so. 

&gt; * Nuclear escalation threats are even less credible. 

&gt; * But the United States did grant Russia a sphere of influence and never attempted to deter Russia from joining with 14 other republics to become the Soviet Union. The United States also basically conceded the occupation of Eastern Europe, reacting tepidly to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia but warning a similar invasion of Romania would elicit a stronger response (Knight, 2018). In other words, the United States was attempting to prevent the Soviet Union from further peripheral expansion, but Moscow was allowed a sphere of influence. 

&gt; * But in China's case, the United States is unwilling to concede such a parallel sphere of influence and thus is trying to deter expansion that Beijing sees as necessary to its national survival. Therefore, the benefits of aggression are much higher for Beijing; Taiwan matters more to Beijing than Berlin or Paris ever did to Moscow. 

&gt; * A key part of the challenge of regional defense involves rounding up a strong group of partners committed to opposing PRC hegemony… It is harder to build such a regional coalition in the competition with China than during the Cold War for several reasons.",4bf97b7ecf10328bf0db3b83a46b9f19b5e3e98d,True,False,,,,,0,1653610354,,0,{},ia4so06,True,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t3_uyl45a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia4so06/,1653610366,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653581554.0,
