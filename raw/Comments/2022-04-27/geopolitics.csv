Most of ""independent"" sources just analyze osint which somehow only manages to show destroyed Russian tanks but nothing about Ukrainian loses. The other independent sources are unnamed sources of the same vein as ""Iraqi wmds"", ""moderate rebels"", ""Russian bounties"". Seriously, go watch media from a different non US client state and see how the war is reported there. Indian and Pakistani media have good coverage (especially India, which has reporters on the ground). Or Latin American news or Middle Eastern sources. Even Asian sources. It's almost like a different war. Or check out Douglas Mcgregor and Scott Ritter, two Americans who actually prepared to fight the Soviets conventionally instead of the rest of the guys who did failed COIN. 

This is not even considering that the US openly admitted to publishing low confidence information publicly. The reality is that NATO and western news is as biased as Ukrainian information should be considered propaganda (as much as Russian sources). 

 Those ""civilian"" areas you mention have been littered with tanks and equipment. There have been repeated videos of Ukrainian forces yelling at civilians who asked them to move howitzers from school yards / hospitals etc (this is pretty common in most wars, as those buildings are normally best fortified, so I'm not blaming the Ukrainians but it is a war crime and legally opens up the area to Russian shelling).

Ukraine had 10k in mariupol, claims 1k left in the factory. Russia says they killed 8k azov and marines, which adds up. And fwiw it's worth, the last Russia mod report had confirmed kills (with documentations) of Ukrainians at around 17k (came out in March), Russian forces at 1 thousand, and no mention of DPR and LPR militas (which probably took the most causalities for the Russian side). We'll only figure out the reality after the war when the books are written but it ironically seems the Russians are telling the truth more. 


The ghost of Kiev is a lie, the snake island ship was a lie, the supposed Ukrainian counter offensives were a lie (if we listen to western media, zelensky should be in the Kremlin by now) , the train station missile attack was a lie (the missiles was confirmed to be in Ukrainian arsenal) Bucha seems to be a lie as well (guardian article says it was mostly artillery which killed them and it happened during Russian control - who fired artillery at Russian positions?) Zelensky is still talking about taking Crimea, much less Donbass like this is some game. 

We already know publicly that the US and Biden directly manipulated the afghan war to make it seem more victorious than it was. But suddenly when it comes to Ukraine that skepticism is gone?

* Romania, while much wealthier than Moldova, is far from rich and may not yet have the resources to properly integrate Moldova.
* EU accession is a greater priority for Moldova than unification, and the former may make the latter a moot point.

It's a guy working in the military logistics and acquisitions space who has turned his day job of giving slide shows likes these into a youtube channel. He's extremely well informed and gives sources for everything.  


&gt;How does this calculus change if the Russians camp out in the Donbass   
region? Will central and western Ukrainians remain as motivated after a few months of an immobile artillery meat grinder in the east?

There are always going to be unknowns when speculating about the will of a fighting force if X, Y, Z happens. But everything I've seen indicates that will is not in short supply on the Ukrainian side.

So long as the airspace remains contested and Ukraine is able to freight weapons to the front lines I don't see *will* as the pillar that's gonna bring down Ukraine's resistance.

If the only option Russia gives Ukraine to stop the meat-grinder in the east...is to cede the east to them...then what's the upshot of acquiescing for Ukraine?

&gt;But this applies to Russia too.  
  
And we can certainly argue that Russia has more capacity if they haven't tapped much into their reserves, but Ukraine has to resort to general mobilisation; this seems more in the eye of the beholder.

Well again, Russia's mobilization and supply lines require a lot more time, money and manpower to set in motion, because they need to get their fresh soldiers from out in central Russia to the front lines of Ukraine. And that goes for hardware as well.

Bear in mind that the expertise and experience required to defend a position is significantly smaller and comes at a lower price tag than launching an offensive to take ground.

But let's say that Russia digs in in the Donbas. In sheer military terms they could pour in enough soldiers and material to sit pretty for the foreseeable future. But holding the Donbas military is very different than making it an operational and productive region --  and not just a huge money sink.

Any infrastructure that they attempt to build would be instantly hit by Ukraine. So I don't see any way that Russia holding Donbas *military* could translate into *annexing* the Donbas.

So what then? Now keeping a frontline up in the Donbas is a big black hole in your military budget that promises no long term strategic gains. How long would Russia be willing hold that frontline?

hampering the growth of a sustainable local economy. It has helped
perpetuate a culture of seeking work abroad that has become something

brings temporary relief at best, not a permanent path out of poverty.

I am familiar with Russia's violations. What did the UK/US do? 

I don't really know enough of the specific details about the causes behind the two gas crises to carry that discussion forward. I don't think it matters much to my underlying point and is a bit tangential, so I'll acknowledge those were the stated reasons. Given the tendency towards kleptocracy in Ukraine at the time, it's very plausible that it was a legitimate complaint. On the other hand, the complaint came from Russia.

&gt; Finland I am just looking at the post WW2 situation. I think Russia was fine with neutrality and would be today. Understanding was that an unarmed/barely armed/locally armed neighbor makes a good buffer state.

I get you. Let's say, hypothetically, that Finland was a de facto buffer state from the end of the Continuation War on. A buffer state between the Soviets and whom, though? Sweden was also neutral. The Soviets certainly didn't need *two* buffer states between them and Norway. Whatever threat Denmark posed was purely maritime and had nothing to do with the rest of the Scandinavian peninsula. (Denmark's ability to close the straits in event of war would have presented a key strategic liability regardless)

That said, Soviet conventional superiority in Europe throughout basically the entire Cold War is well known. Their ability to mobilize massive numbers of forces and throw tens of thousands of armored vehicles at the Fulda Gap caused no small amount of consternation in Europe. That threat is what gave rise to such pessimistic projections as ""Soviets at the Rhine in seven days."" 

I also don't really buy the buffer state argument because when the Soviets wanted a buffer state, they weren't very subtle about it. Austria's declaration of permanent neutrality is exactly what we'd expect from true buffer states. 

&gt; Peacekeepers in turn have not been a problem for the West either, all talk of self governance aside.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Peacekeepers are sometimes altruistic, but peacekeeping is often used as a way to enhance a nation's influence (in other words, it's soft imperialism). Foreign policy and morality do not often line up and the manifest failure of the great powers to come together and stop genocides is clear. Nobody really intervened in Rwanda, for instance, and the West was lethargic and often ineffective in its initial intervention in the former Yugoslavia (see the inability of peacekeepers present in Bosnia to prevent Srebrenica). 

That's not just a West thing, of course. The Russian involvement in South Ossetia prior to the 2008 conflict is a good example, as is Transnistria (which is getting progressively more coverage since the invasion of Ukraine). 

&gt; Kazakhstan would totally become a problem if they chose to follow the path of Georgia. Airlifts and cheap arms sales are plenty to destabilize a region and kick off proxy wars. Convenient route maybe, but more useful to India and China than for the US. In that proxy war the West would be surrounded by powers that have an interest squashing that conflict though.

I think Kazakhstan would probably lose that war badly before foreign aid could get there. Or, rather, foreign aid other than Chinese aid. 

&gt; China and Russia don't have to be friends, they have shared interests. China is fine with Russia keeping the US and NATO busy. I don't buy into the national pride thing much but constant encroachment and hypocrisy aren't received well. In contrast to the Chinese they won't keep their smile.

Russia might keep NATO busy, but it doesn't keep the US busy. US doctrine is that the US needs to be able to fight any two powers in the world, simultaneously, and win a conventional war. That's why the US has such an overpowering air advantage. (Also, fun fact: if we go by absolute count alone, instead of just fixed wing aircraft, the US Army is a bigger air force than the total air assets of Russia or China). 

The US is essentially so powerful it can lead both NATO and a de facto anti-China coalition in the Pacific at once. If China cultivated a Russian friend just to distract America, it doesn't work. The best case scenario here is that it reduces the involvement of the UK and France, which isn't really something they needed to worry about anyway. 

&gt; I don't think small countries between major blocs get to have total freedom to align really.

Shouldn't a nation have the right to self-determination in both domestic and foreign policy? Consider Austria and Switzerland. Neither are part of NATO, but they benefit from NATO indirectly because they're encircled by NATO. Austria could disband its army tomorrow and its strategic situation would be unchanged. 

The reality is that the West is generally more hands-off and will allow more autonomy and freedom in this space than Russia will. After all, NATO didn't approach Finland and Sweden. They approached NATO.

&gt; Post war Germany where I live could choose US and the Marshall plan or Communism and Morgenthau.

Sort of. One side built the Wall and sought to contain its people. And there weren't exactly a lot of people fleeing from West Germany into the East. 

&gt;  From all the options Ukraine could have chosen they floated the most extreme and unpalatable and got cheered on.

I disagree. Russia kicked off the current crisis back in 2014 when they invaded. If you look at the Ukrainian army's equipment and performance in 2014, it is very clear they didn't have much Western support. That has obviously changed in the intervening years, but you can't lay the blame for the Russian invasion on the West supporting Ukraine. The West was probably prepared to leave Ukraine as a buffer state. Without the impetus of the Russian invasion to drastically rework the Ukrainian government and military, it's unlikely that Ukraine would have met NATO standards for quite some time (and even longer for EU standards). 

But what did Ukraine do in 2014, really? They ousted a president that was so unashamedly pro-Russia that he fled his own country and is living in Russia now? To me, that just sounds like a Russian agent of influence was ousted and went running home. Russia was upset they lost their agent and so they invaded. It's probably telling that the snipers in 2014, who fired at both sides, appear to be part of a unit that outright defected to Russia. 

It seems to me like Russia used a variety of imperialistic strategies to suppress the will of the Ukrainian citizenry, failed, and then resorted to invasion and a simmering conflict that erupted again recently. I don't really see much in the way of Ukrainian escalation here. 

&gt; Annexing so far didn't happen any more than the US annexed Iraq or Afghanistan.

I was referring to the annexation of Crimea.

&gt; Regarding IRBMs I would disagree, I think we will see the first use of tac nukes soon. If the West succeeds in delivering enough SAMs and keeps ramping up heavy weapon deliveries, it becomes imperative for RF to destroy rails and roads, maybe airfields. That's been proven hard to achieve conventionally. Same for current army doctrine, once drones and attrition make massed artillery unfeasibly and with trenches not an option, classic tactical nukes might be considered.

Things like railways and air fields are notoriously hard to destroy anyway. Bombing missions on targets like that tend to be expensive and the damage ephemeral. There was a gif on r/popular recently about Ukrainian rail teams repairing damage and they've been doing that from day one. I would agree that if you want to destroy a railway, you need to either have boots on the ground or you need a massive deployment of munitions; tactical nukes are the ""easiest"" option here, if we ignore the potential political ramifications. 

The problem with using tactical nukes is that Russia is struggling across the broader front. There would need to be multiple strikes along the front lines to crack Ukrainian defenses and allow a push, but that's assuming we're now marching Russian BTGs into irradiated spaces. Alternatively, nukes deep behind enemy lines at logistical targets that won't immediately erode the conventional forces that have been grinding Russia up may prove problematic. Basically, if Russia used tactical nukes, they'd likely have to deploy *a bunch of them* to achieve a decisive effect. And even then they have to occupy the territory and endure the casualties. 

And all that's assuming there aren't serious ramifications from the use of nukes. There probably would be. That's not a precedent any sane power wants to set. 

&gt; I think the really aggressive superpower game is mostly played by the US, even with all the nationalism in China I haven't seen anyone scream ""world domination"" as much as the US. I haven't heard of ""Chinese exceptionalism"" either. 

""American exceptionalism"" irks me. Sure, we're rich and powerful, but how many problems do we have because we refuse to address them? 

China is a new and rising power. It has a relatively short ""reach,"" as it were. Despite that, we're seeing China become progressively more and more assertive over the South China Sea. China will be more involved in the ""world domination"" game in a decade. Give them four and they'll probably wield the sort of influence the Soviets did at their peak. 

&gt; NATO involvement sounds different here, I am a few miles from the Fulda Gap, this was the planned nuclear desert to stop Russian tanks.

Hell, the likelihood of a no-win scenario for Putin is one of the main reasons many people predicted that there would be no full scale attack.

That's not something Washington can control in the first place. Make it more likely by abandoning Ukraine entirely, sure, but the way this is going it's not clear that it would not have turned into a full on civil war. Which would be better for the piece of mind of people freaking out over nuclear posturing but likely worse in every other way.

The only compromise could have been Putin actually treating Ukraine like the neutral state one of various the Kremlin cover stories and various western apologists claim would solve the issue. Since he has given every indication that he is simply incapable of accepting Ukraine's very existence outside of firm Russian control (and I would call anyone still suggesting otherwise naive at best) that was not a real option either.

There was never an off ramp. The only way this will end as a full scale war is by making it effectively impossible for Russia to do anything but defend whatever positions they are forced to fall back to in Ukraine. The further it drags on the more people will die and the way to avoid that is by enabling Ukraine to win on the battlefield.

The TDF  has multiple times had to turn people away because they were experiencing too many volunteers. That's why Zelensky has been harping on about arms and heavy weapons needed.

The Ukranian nation spent decades after their ephemeral declaration of Independence after the Brest Litvosk Treaty was signed, and centuries before that.

How does this prove that ukraine shouldn't exist. All you are saying is that Ukraine has been subjugated for centuries. Armenia was subjugated for centuries, maybe we should destroy them? Scotland was subjugated, Estonia was subjugated , Finland and latvia were subjugated. Is it right if the turks come after greece and Bulgaria next? I mean they were a part of a Turkish empire for 400+ years?

&gt;Also, the Kievan Rus is the birthplace of both Russia and Ukraine, just like Germany and France are the heirs of Charlemagne.

I would say Germany and Austria are much more accurate. But still if Austrian people didn't want to unite with Germany, but germany wanted it anyway, then isn't it in Austrian people's right to rebel and fight?

And finally while technically kievan rus is the birthplace of russia, it's political culture is more or less Mongolian. And it is not derogatory to tell one's political culture is Mongolian. While Kievan rus developed as more or less a European state, Muscovy the predecessor of Russia didn't develop as a European state.

After Chechnya secured de-facto independence after the first Chechen war infighting emerged with different Chechen factions.

Russia under Putin has given Chechnya economic aid in the billions that gets distributed by Kadyrov  directly who in exchange keeps Chechnya stable(with surveillance state tactics) and doesn’t pursue de facto independence. 

Kadyrov and Putin are very much tied to one another politically. For Putin, pacifying Chechnya represents one of his biggest accomplishments. For Kadyrov, Russia gives him billions every year while also helping him suppress his political rivals.

&gt;Ugh. No more taker nations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Poland was valuable and brought something to the table. They were also willing to follow our lead. What exactly does Sweden or Finland bring to the table besides more obligation and burden for the US?

  
You are here saying Finland brings nothing to the table except being a burden. So I’m not confused, and please don’t try to move the goalposts. What you said is there for all to see.

And if you want to pretend that you called Finland a ‘taker’ nation because it’s off the NATO requirement by a *rounding error*, go ahead. But only two countries in Europe have higher military gdp spending than Finland. So I guess you consider the entire alliance a taker alliance then? Because Finland brings more to the table than just about every other country in NATO, on a per capita basis.

&gt;Going back to you 5-1 ratio? So what? Did the referees tally up the millions of Soviets killed in WW2 and award Germany a technical victory? No. The Soviets won, despite horrific loses. Just like the Soviets won in Finland. 

I genuinely can’t tell if you’re being serious or if you’re trolling. *…So what?* So the nation you called a ‘burden’, and a ‘taker’, outperforms almost all other countries its size. So that’s a valuable partner to have? I don't know how to explain this to you if you can't intuit that on a rudimentary level? 

If a guy fights 20 people single-handedly and takes out 5-6 before they take him down, is your takeaway really gonna be “Well he lost the fight so he’s not a good fighter.”? Of course not. You'd want that guy on your team.

If Finland barely losing a war to the Soviet Union is disqualifying to you, I can’t imagine how you feel about the US losing to Vietnam?  


&gt;Which furthers my point that Finland isn't defensible against Russia. Losing well didn't get them anything. 

It truly doesn’t further any point you’re making. The whole point of NATO is it’s a defensive ***ALLIANCE***. Finland doesn’t need to be able to defend its border on its own (??) to be a valuable asset. Nor does Estonia. Or Poland. Do you think NATO has a 2% gdp spend requirement because one country spending 2% on its own is enough to win a war against Russia or China? Do you think the requirement for NATO membership is that every country needs to be able to individually defeat Russia?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Having more 5th gen fighters per Capita doesn't mean anything (at all). They have an enormous land border with their enemy. They have a low population. They are a liability.

This is a baffling take. The idea that it doesn’t matter that Finland has a better and more modern air force than... *the country* *currently pushing back a Russian invasion*…is certainly a thought a person can have.

Over 3,200 km north of the Solomon Islands sits the islands of Guam, the fortress of the United States’ power projection in the Pacific. But a new security deal between China and Solomon Islands can change the balance of power – putting the US and its allies in a difficult position.

The US grand strategy in Asia has swung back and forth between its maximum presence from World War II through the Vietnam war to partial retrenchment during the Nixon Doctrine and its return to Asia under Barack Obama. The US’ reluctant approach to its presence in the Pacific has left a gap for China to fill.

Guam is part of the US’ Second Island Chain defence strategy, which emerged as the primary containment approach toward China since the end of the Cold War.

China’s presence in the Solomon Islands has seen private Chinese enterprises trying to acquire strategic assets for the military. China Sam Enterprise Group, a company that produces weapons and has ties with the Chinese defence ministry, has tried to acquire Tulagi islet for a potential infrastructure project. The deal raised alarm in the Solomon Islands, and was eventually blocked by the attorney general. But that didn’t stop China Sam.

The Solomon Islands has been rewarded for severing ties with Taiwan. The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is building “seven China Funded facilities for the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara City”. The Solomon Islands has signed on to the Belt and Road Initiative, but it’s unclear which projects have been approved.

The hand-wringing in Canberra over the security deal has been on public display over the last few days. Australia has described the potential naval base in the Solomon Islands as a “red line”. Australia knew about the deal with the Solomon Islands days before the document was leaked as a last resort to stalling it.

Even Japan has sent Parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Kentaro Uesugi to the Solomon Islands “to convey Japan’s apprehension over China’s recent attempts to expand its military activities in the region”.",9534e10a9ad1f0fe21b03c0ead3b3bb184384ee6,True,False,,,,,0,1651081173,,0,{},i6fe2jk,True,t3_ud94ly,False,True,t3_ud94ly,/r/geopolitics/comments/ud94ly/chinasolomon_islands_deal_marks_a_power_shift_us/i6fe2jk/,1651081189,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651052373.0,

Budapest Memorandum was violated by pretty much everyone involved. The gas crisis IMO had two main reasons, gas theft and the unsustainable conditions of the contract. With all these contracts I wonder how guarantees are really doing anything. What do you get with guarantors like Germany signing some paper?

Finland I am just looking at the post WW2 situation. I think Russia was fine with neutrality and would be today. Understanding was that an unarmed/barely armed/locally armed neighbor makes a good buffer state.

Ukraine is being armed by the West for years now.

Peacekeepers in turn have not been a problem for the West either, all talk of self governance aside.

Kazakhstan would totally become a problem if they chose to follow the path of Georgia. Airlifts and cheap arms sales are plenty to destabilize a region and kick off proxy wars. Convenient route maybe, but more useful to India and China than for the US. In that proxy war the West would be surrounded by powers that have an interest squashing that conflict though.

China and Russia don't have to be friends, they have shared interests. China is fine with Russia keeping the US and NATO busy. I don't buy into the national pride thing much but constant encroachment and hypocrisy aren't received well. In contrast to the Chinese they won't keep their smile.

Russia to me doesn't demand influence per se or at least not more than the US in any country. We can agree to call any sphere of influence imperialism then. I don't think small countries between major blocs get to have total freedom to align really. Post war Germany where I live could choose US and the Marshall plan or Communism and Morgenthau. From all the options Ukraine could have chosen they floated the most extreme and unpalatable and got cheered on. I can imagine the Western reaction if they had floated a new Eastern federation to oppose NATO encroachment postulating Russian or Ukrainian nuclear armament and S400 bases.

Annexing so far didn't happen any more than the US annexed Iraq or Afghanistan. Granted, the results are pretty much the same. ""Limited military operations"". I find it rich that a US led west could call anyone imperialist.. at least from a German perspective after 40 years of occupation and still hosting US nuclear arms and Ramstein air base.

Regarding IRBMs I would disagree, I think we will see the first use of tac nukes soon. If the West succeeds in delivering enough SAMs and keeps ramping up heavy weapon deliveries, it becomes imperative for RF to destroy rails and roads, maybe airfields. That's been proven hard to achieve conventionally. Same for current army doctrine, once drones and attrition make massed artillery unfeasibly and with trenches not an option, classic tactical nukes might be considered.

I don't think Russia perceives their situation as having a seat, neither does the middle east, India  or China. EU maybe but they may change their mind soon. I think the really aggressive superpower game is mostly played by the US, even with all the nationalism in China I haven't seen anyone scream ""world domination"" as much as the US. I haven't heard of ""Chinese exceptionalism"" either. Having been there I felt them pretty self centered and territorially satisfied. Any new territory would mean added problems, not beneficial.

Ill will to Russia. Maybe but this is week 8 or so. Our attention span is limited and energy inflation is rising. Germany is scared and hoarding sunflower oil and wheat. There are people younger than 80 that were born in today's Poland and who fled to Germany after the war.

You are aware carriers don't just go out on their own... right?  They accompanied by other ships... and some of those ships have big guns.  The whole Navy is centered around the Air Craft Carrier Fleets.  Even though they are called Air Craft Carrier fleets... it isn't just air craft carriers... there's many types of ships.

https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2021/02/15/can-the-biden-administration-break-the-cycle-of-marathon-naval-deployments-to-the-mideast/

&gt;No, they can't. Due to the layered defence that you've already mentioned.

I recommend you read up on some military science/simulations regarding how the US carrier fleets would fare in an engagement with China, or in a nuclear war.   The conclusive result seems to be that they cannot shoot down high tech missiles with a high enough success rate, and that eventually they fall.  It takes one cheap nuke, or even tactical nuke getting through to completely decimate a carrier group.  Even outside of nuclear weapons, all it takes is one disabling shot from a torpedo or hypersonic missile to cripple a carrier fleet.

&gt;Yes, they can. Yes, they can and yes they can.

So you're saying a carrier can outrun a missile?  Or aircraft?  I'm not sure if you're trolling at this point.  The idea that whole Carrier fleets(or even a single ""stealth"" carrier) can evade satellite imaging is also laughable, to the point that I again question whether you're trolling, or seriously believe these things.

In the end, you just keep replying ""no"" giving no evidence or even reasoning behind what you believe.  You don't seem to understand basic terminology.  

The F35-B can do vertical takeoffs at least partially.  Meaning you could obviously deploy much cheaper mobild landing pads if you wanted to.

I think if we are concerned about the possibility of Russia launching nuclear weapons because of an unstable leader wishing to destroy the world, then perhaps we should discuss whether MAD is still the appropriate paradigm for thinking about nuclear weapons, not whether Ukraine should be sacrificed to Russia so they don't throw a tantrum and destroy the world.

I also think that Russia's security cannot be guaranteed, especially by appeasement.  They have significant problems, like ongoing brain drain, and huge economic challenges as Europe pivots towards renewable energy to fight climate change.  Even if Europe decided to lift their sanctions, they are still going to be working in the long run to decease the energy they purchase from Russia.  

&gt; Also I never once argued that the West shouldn't send arms to Ukraine.

You were agreeing with a comment that said it was best if Russia won.  If we accept your premise that the best outcome is that Russia wins because if they don't they'll nuke the world, then it doesn't make sense to send weapons to Ukraine.  

Even more, the logic that individual countries should be sacrificed to appease the whims of evil men because if they are not given their way they could nuke the world could be extended to any country in the world, NATO or not.  That hardly sounds like the best outcome.  When you suggest that the best outcome is for Ukraine to lose, remember that Russia has committed many war crimes like mass rape, ethnic cleansing, and initial targeting of civilians in this war.  

The outcome of the war is still very much unknown to anybody.  At this point, I think Russia taking and holding the entirety of the country of Ukraine seems unlikely, even given their willingness to destroy everything in their path.  However, I think it will be incredibly challenging for Ukraine to take back all their territory including Crimea, even given the large amounts of aid given by the west and the crippling sanctions imposed on Russia.

&gt;I would recommend you doing some very basic research because you can literally type into google “how many air craft carriers can the usa deploy at one time” and you will get a navy source as the first response confirming what I said.

No, you don't. But I'm sure you can provide the source backing up your claims.

&gt;there are vital maintainance periods for things like engine maintainance.  But these can be rushed if need be.

You can't rush or expedite an ROCH.

&gt;If for instance a war with China/Russia broke out, the usa wouldn’t keep carriers in maintainance just to redo the upholstery.  

They would if the aircraft carrier required its reactor refueling

&gt;I perfectly understand what carriers provide.  The ability to use aircraft, as well as big guns almost anywhere in the world. 

I really don't think you do. What ""big guns"" do aircraft carriers have?

&gt;The problem is that a few high tech missiles can cripple the carrier… making the whole carrier group neutered.

No, they can't. Due to the layered defence that you've already mentioned.

&gt;But now with satellites, ramjet, icbm, etc carriers cannot run.  They cannot hide.  And they certainly cannot defend themselves for very long, even with dozens of supporting ships around them.

Yes, they can. Yes, they can and yes they can.

&gt;You seem to lack imagination.  We already have F variant jets that can do assisted vertical takeoffs

Erm, what?

&gt;And we would be in a LOT better position to for instance defend taiwan.

No, we wouldn't.

&gt;Use Japan as runways.  Use Hawaii.  Use any of the dozens of countries near China.


What?

&gt;The second we bring a carrier to the South China Sea in a hot conflict with China/Taiwan it will be destroyed.

No, it's not.

&gt;As far as a runway not being able to be repaired… look at Ukraine man.  It’s literally going on before our eyes.  Same in Afghanistan.  They bombed runways.  In 8-12 hours they would be functional again. 

Sigh, that's not the case. 

&gt;You cannot avoid things with an air craft carrier.

Yes, you can.

&gt; The only option is to have a 100% intercept rate, or to not even enter the battle.

No, it's not.

Even then, it remains highly doubtful that he would be able to accomplish on a national level what he accomplished in one city.

That being said, what happened in Grozny *has already occurred* in Ukraine. Mariupol is essentially destroyed, and will require a decade or more to rebuild. The looting, reaving, and destruction of the country is horrifying. It is for this very reason that Ukrainian resistance is so determined, and should be supported. They know that it is a war for their existence as a nation. Other nations should listen to and support them, not prematurely call for a negotiated peace. Calls to avoid escalation by not arming the Ukrainians are simply calls for Ukrainians to be enslaved. Such calls will only encourage future aggression from Russia. It's important to state here that Ukraine did not in any way prompt this war. This casus belli was manufactured from the start. They are the victims of this aggression. They are the ones resisting. They are the ones who are bravely saying ""No"" to Putin's land grab. When they are ready to negotiate peace, they will let the world know.

As far as what Washington is doing, and what it should do: Washington is providing direct military aid, which is appropriate. Washington is not unwilling to act. They are directly supporting Ukraine in the form of weapons and hardware. They should continue to do so and seek to expand it whenever possible. This is not necessarily an easy task, as the weapons systems that Ukraine uses are not generally logistically compatible with NATO systems, which is why we see further assistance in the form of training beginning. They should support other European countries who are also providing assistance, and encourage it whenever possible. Are they providing enough to Ukraine? Probably not. Can they provide more?

In some senses, arms limitation treaties with them are silly and unnecessary because (1) Russia can't actually afford to maintain these huge arsenals without a corresponding budget hike it can't afford *or* short-changing conventional forces and (2) Russia has shown a willingness to break treaties when they're inconvenient. In addition to the obvious violations of the Budapest Memorandum, one might be able to make the case that the '05 or '09 gas crises were exactly the sort of economic pressure the Budapest Memorandum was intended to prevent. 

&gt; Finland and Sweden historically were seen as buffer states. Even though Finland has a long border and could impact access to Murmansk and Kola peninsula, that hardly gives an invasion route to Moscow. St Petersburg is a lost cause anyway to both sides, just like the Baltic states and Kaliningrad. It's all too small for strategic efforts.

Eh. Depends on how far back we're talking with terms like ""historically."" There are people alive today who were alive when Finland and Russia were last at war. The Continuation War was less than one human lifetime ago. But yes, Finland's careful balancing act was a deliberate choice to embrace neutrality. And given Russia's increasingly irredentist tendencies, and the fact that Finland was once part of the Russian Empire, it seems perfectly reasonable for Finland to look at current events and say, ""yeah, the status quo doesn't protect us anymore."" Which seems to be what they're saying. 

Sweden has a slightly longer tradition of neutrality, to be fair. Although that's kind of an unfair comparison; before Finland was part of the Russian Empire, it was part of the Swedish Empire. Finland has spent most of the past thousand years occupied by foreign nations; of course its history is a bit skewed in that respect. 

&gt; Moldova is remote enough not to be a problem and a fraction of the size of Ukraine. They also can't blockade Crimea or Djnepr or Djnestr.

Moldova is enough of a problem to warrant the permanent deployment of Russian military forces on the east bank of the Dneister as ""peacekeepers."" They were supposed to withdraw years ago and, if Moldova was as unimportant as you're portraying, they would have. 

&gt; Kazakhstan is less of a threat as it is more landlocked in Asia and shares no borders with NATO countries.

Kazakhstan's threat is mitigated by the relatively high proportion of Russian speakers and the comparative weakness of Kazakh as a language. Russification there was more widespread than in other post-Soviet states. That said, it represents an absolutely critical strategic threat and would *definitely* be a flashpoint if Russia ever perceived its position as weakening. 

You mentioned the ""soft underbelly"" of Russia earlier. That term more readily applies to the border with Kazakhstan, which is much more sparsely defended and populated. Additionally, Kazakhstan straddles the steppes south of the Urals. It's the only truly convenient invasion route into Russia proper from Asia. And why is that relevant? 

China. China and Russia are not friends. They collaborate, but their end goals are increasingly conflicting. Russia views imperialism as old school. They have the power, or someone else does. It's a zero sum game to them. With that in mind, rising Chinese influence in Central Asia, states which were formerly under Moscow's control, can *only* be construed as a long-term threat by Russia. 

We're not quite at the point where China is actively sabotaging Russia (although if China starts supplying Russia just enough to stay in the fight in Ukraine and continue hemorrhaging assets, you'll know we've reached that point), but we'll be there eventually. Russian national pride is such that it will never submit to being the second power in a military alliance and the cold, incontrovertible truth of the 21st century is that Russia is not nearly as powerful as China. We will see these two powers increasingly butt heads as years drag on and the relative power balance skews more and more towards China.

&gt; I don't see Russia as that imperialist, they just have to ""lean"" to the Stans and Mongolia and can't afford to be contained more aggressively.

Does Russia demand influence in how Ukraine governs itself and manages its foreign affairs, while simultaneously refusing to offer the same concession? Then that is, by definition, imperialism. Applying pressure is still imperialism. 

Russia is far from the only imperialist power. But they are the only imperialist power that's formally annexing parts of other countries. The West and China definitely engage in soft imperialism, often under some sort of plausible deniability, but Russia is flagrant in their approach.  

&gt; IRBMs make a difference as they are seen as tactical and nearly impossible to discern from normal cruise missiles. If you see an ICBM launched, you can launch yours and be sure it's a nuclear strike. If you see a Kinzhal flying into Ukraine now you can only pray it's conventional. ICBMs still have 30m+ flight times, hypersonic can hit in 2 minutes, allowing for decapitation strikes. The calculation will be entirely different.

Okay, sure. But every major nuclear power has second strike capability. You can always land the first punch in a nuclear exchange, but there's no chance to actually *win* that exchange if the other guy has a second strike capacity. The West primarily achieves that with geography (distance between US silos and Russian launchers) and submarines. The Russians achieve that primarily with their mobile launcher assets as their submarines are perhaps not as reliable as their Western counterparts. 

IRBMs don't actually change the strategic balance of power between Washington and Moscow. IRBMs offer Moscow a cheaper and faster nuclear option for Europe, sure, but again we run into the problem of second strike capability. And a secondary problem is the nuclear umbrella. 

&gt; NATO can change their rules any time. Western rules are really flexible if there is enough of an outcry and it benefits the US. I don't think Russia can rely on these rules or promises the West gave them.

Much has been made of these promises of late, but I've yet to see some sort of treaty or other legally binding document that said NATO would stop expanding. I have, however, seen a legally binding document that said Russia would respect Ukraine's borders. And we know how that went.

Once again, we come back to the key issue at hand: Russia had a chance to pursue détente, to become meaningfully part of the global order. Russia chose not to do so. The reasons here are many and varied, but the end result is unchanged. Russia was offered a seat. They didn't like that the seat came with strings (Russia had to treat other European states as peers, for one), so they decided to go off and do their own thing. 

Doing so is absolutely Russia's prerogative. But Russia doesn't get to turn down the offer, wage information warfare against the West, bully its neighbors, and then act outraged and indignant when all their aggressions on the world stage come back to haunt them. And that's what this conflict in Ukraine is -- it's all the ill will that Russia has generated with their saber rattling and bombastic rhetoric and foreign meddling being repaid by the countries with the means to do so.",438bd8b3d8def51641e6c1b73948f28514fb2aef,True,False,,,,,0,1651069128,,0,{},i6ejaxw,False,t3_ucswh2,False,True,t1_i6ec845,/r/geopolitics/comments/ucswh2/what_if_the_ukraine_victory_scenario_falters/i6ejaxw/,1651069140,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651040328.0,

&gt;Putin's going to die eventually, so someone worse than him can always come along.  Someone better can come along too.

This is true, however, I the topic was whether or not Ukraine wins, not if Putin dies of old age. So I gave my thoughts for that specific context. Also, when assessing geopolitics, I tend to focus on things that are guaranteed. When there are many possibilities of things occurring, and odds of them happening can't be quantified, my judgement is to think of the possible worst outcomes to see if something might be a good option. Given that many of the Russian elites around Putin's circle view the West as a menace that should be destroyed, there's a possibility that Putin is keeping them at bay for realist (political theory) concerns. Now, I'm not an expert on the internal workings of the Kremlin, so if someone is and wants to chime in, feel free to do so, I'd love to learn a bit on the topic. It's also true someone good can get into power, but I find that highly unlikely since those in power seem to hold a tight grip on power and seem to hold similar views about the West that Putin does.

&gt;So you are hallucinating insane and unlikely scenarios, many of which can occur completely independently of Ukraine as a means of justifying that the west leave Ukraine without assistance?

Not exactly. With the context mentioned above, I hope it paints a bit of a better picture of my intentions. Yes, some of these scenarios can happen independently of what goes on in Ukraine. But if what happens in Ukraine starts or accelerates already existing power struggles, then I do think what goes on in Ukraine matters. Also I never once argued that the West shouldn't send arms to Ukraine. The question I was trying to address was what would happen if Ukraine won, which can happen independently of the West's involvement, even if it's highly unlikely.

&gt;The Kremlin has no means of stopping the west from giving weapons to Ukraine.

Yeah, you're right on that. I probably shouldn't have added that in.

If for instance a war with China/Russia broke out, the usa wouldn’t keep carriers in maintainance just to redo the upholstery.  

I perfectly understand what carriers provide.  The ability to use aircraft, as well as big guns almost anywhere in the world.  Combine that with tons of layered defenses, and it sounds great.

In the referendum in the last dying moments of the USSR, 90%+ of Ukrainians demanded independence. There was a sweet spot for a time, then Russia began aggressively meddling in Ukrainian affairs. It worked for a time, then it didn’t. Then they invaded, with Ukrainian resistance initially collapsing, before settling for a half-victory that didn’t really achieve their strategic goals. Then, a few years later, we have a mask-off situation near Kerch with uniformed forces of both nations shooting at one another. And then a few years later we have this. 

At every single point since something like 2004, Russia has resorted to old school imperialism. They have bribed politicians, fomented unrest, lied during diplomatic meetings, and so forth. Russia can certainly do all these things, but actions have consequences. If Russia wants to pursue this old school, map redrawing imperialism, fine. But it needs to be prepared to face resistance from other powers. NATO shouldn’t simply ignore Ukraine because it has a large border. That’s a terrible idea and one doomed to dismal failure. 

Case in point: suppose Russia annexes Ukraine and brings it into a union with itself and Belarus. We’re talking about the thing Russian nationalists have been talking about for ages. What about countries with long borders then? Does NATO concede Finland, with its long border and proximity to St Petersburg? Does NATO concede Moldova, as Russia now has the longest border with them? Perhaps Lithuania, as the proportional border there is pretty considerable? We can chase this “long border, Russia has valid concerns” thing down for however long you want. It’s kind of a silly argument. 

The bottom line is that it is Russia that has chosen conflict and friction at every turn. NATO is probably going to expand along their borders as a direct result of this. Kazakhstan (which has probably realized they’re a likely second target) has taken this opportunity to break with Russia on some important things. Georgia and Japan are making noises about lost territories. 

I also think proximity of nukes (which Ukraine doesn’t have) doesn’t mean anything anymore. Back when true ICBMs were scarce, proximity allowed IRBMs to pose a threat. These days, Russia can threaten basically every world power from just about any place in their territory. It just doesn’t matter. Russia responded to Finland and Sweden expressing intent to join NATO by threatening to deploy nuclear assets to Kaliningrad. This was barely news worthy because, except for tactical usage in a conventional war, this genuinely does not matter. And do Finland and Sweden were not deterred. 

Russia had its chance to sit at the table. It instead decided on old school map redrawing. This is where that inevitably leads.

And then lost those gains. As sad as it is, the region south of Kherson up to Mariupol was virtually undefendable, that's why Ukrainians pulled back across the Dnieper. 

&gt; they still more or less lose on every major front. 

You mean they completely pushed back the Russians on the northern and northeastern fronts?

&gt; more or less endlessly supplied

Endlessly supplied? Up to few days ago, all they were getting were some handheld rocket launchers and ammo. Contrary to popular belief, you cannot do much with those weapons. You can shoot down a helicopter or destroy an APC, that's it. 

&gt; supported with advanced intelligence

What do you expect this intelligence to do? It's not like Ukraine can just create brand-new tanks because of it. 

&gt; I mean Russia's practically taken all of Ukraine's shoreline

No, they havent. They control around 50%, which is mostly the closed-off Sea of Azov region. Odessa still has access to international waters and will almost certainly be able to defend itself.

&gt; moving to take the Donbass region in its entirety...

NATO leaders and military analysts knew in late January that the Donbass region will be taken over, because it would be tremendously hard to defend.

It looks to me that you're projecting your own misguided assumptions. Nobody expected Ukraine to put up solid resistance. Half of NATO expected them to fall within a week, that's why they haven't sent heavy weapons. Too much risk of them being taken over by the Russians.

Russia has never valued the life of a soldier.",1923bd2437f3cec46d0b2fcfd9a4b66b14be266b,True,False,,,,,0,1651063032,,0,{},i6e5wcf,False,t3_ucswh2,False,False,t1_i6dyg32,/r/geopolitics/comments/ucswh2/what_if_the_ukraine_victory_scenario_falters/i6e5wcf/,1651063047,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651034232.0,

Russia isn't doing bad, they haven't lost massive amounts of troops, they are not demoralized, They have made huge gains ever since the military conflict started. The Ukrainians are certainly giving as good as they are getting, but in every engagement they're not able to be to the Russians back, they still more or less lose on every major front.

You can have debates on military strategy, like is using the starvation tactic of encircling cities and other population centers still valid in today's world, it was certainly effective when the Soviets did it.

Fact of the matter is Russia is winning against a Ukraine that is being more or less endlessly supplied and supported with advanced intelligence from the greatest military alliance the world has seen and recent memory. 

Even with all of this Ukrainian still losing guys, I mean Russia's practically taken all of Ukraine's shoreline, 90% of which was historically Russia's, and they are moving to take the Donbass region in its entirety... Seems like they're winning to me.

Afghanistan is one of the most Mountainous places in the world, and as such you can dig tunnel networks and other such great guerilla points. Just like the Vietnam Jungles.

This is how the Taliban could hold off the US. Regardless of the US's actions it was near impossible to get EVERY stronghold without basically carpet bombing the mountains into dust. 

Which is obviously both unfeasible and devastating to the world's climates.

Remember the US under Trump deployed the MOAB in hostile actions for the first time and still didn't clear out the tunnels in that area.

Because Ukraine is flat, and lacks tree cover digging tunnels is VERY EASY to spot with satalites and they are far more easy to destroy.

Likewise as our constant video survailence of Russian forces is proving, its impossible to do anything in Ukraine without Satalites obviously picking it up.

Guerilla tactics require hard to detect OR destroy tunnels (which flat grasslands makes very difficult) lots of ambushes (which are harder to do in flat terrain) and the ability to sabotage supply lines effectively (Which works best in climates where you either lack water OR the available water isn't safe to drink)

I think this is the crux of the whole article and so much commentary on the war in general. People are talking past one another because they define ""victory"" in different ways.

The US was ""victorious"" over Saddam's regime in 2003 and the Taliban in 2002, but they were strategic losses for the country. A similar scenario where Russian forces regroup and rout Ukrainian forces and decapitate Ukrainian leadership, does that translate to a Russian victory?

The Russians will have to stay in Ukraine for decades expending massive amounts of materiel to sustain control against a capable and armed insurgency. Western sanctions and covert support will continue, and perhaps increase as the media narrative on Russian atrocities continues as Russia install a Kadyrov-esque regime in Ukraine. This whole process will continue to sap Russia hard and soft power projection.

I'm trying to look at this from a critical perspective, but I cannot see a scenario where Ukrainian resistance just disappears after defeat. This war has radicalized the entire Ukrainian population to be vehemently anti-Russian. The West isn't going to stop supporting Ukraine even if they're defeated, and they certainly aren't going to lift sanctions.

If Ukraine simply doesn't agree to a peace treaty that cedes territory to Russia - and I've seen nothing to suggest that they would - then how exactly is Russia going to come out of this conflict victoriously in the long term?

Ukraine will see more western hardware flow into the country, they will receive training on western systems and drones and will be able to deny the Russian total air dominance for the duration. So what does Russia do with its troops in the Donbas now? Even if they dig in? Every piece of military or civilian infrastructure they set up will almost certainly be targeted by drones that Russia so far has been unable to counter effectively.

And in the next 6-8 months Ukraine will be training more and more fighters, and have thousands of military veterans created by this conflict. Again, every time Ukraine takes out a tank, they're taking out a piece of military capability that is not able to be replaced in the next 6 months. The training and experience of the people operating the tanks. 

Ukraine doesn't need an army of tanks to defeat Russia. They just need an army of people trained in ATGMs and drone systems which is a significantly lower investment in terms both time and money.

&gt;An ACC is more easily defendable when it's near a coast, with land defenses to support it. 

No, it's not. See Taranto.

&gt;And if the ACC gets damaged, it can become a sitting duck very easily.  If it's out in the ocean when this happens(and far from a coastline with AA), you basically have to scuttle the ship.

No, you don't. See any of the Pacific engagements in WW2.

&gt;According to the US navy they can deploy 8/11 or more at a time.  If necessary all 11 could be deployed, on relatively short notice.  There's a difference between peacetime standards and wartime standards.  

No, they can't. As I said, do some research on ROCH and upkeep availability.

&gt;Yes, but you can build 10,000+ land based airfields for the price of a carrier. 

No, you really can't.

&gt;And if they blow it up, you just smooth out the holes, and it's usable again(unlike an ACC which sinks).

No, you can't. See Port Stanley airfield during the Falklands War.

&gt;The US interstate highway system is literally one massive airfield that spans the country, and they specifically designed it with straight aways long enough for takeoff and landing.

An airfield (and aircraft carrier) are so much more than just runways.

&gt;Yes, I'm aware of laser defense.  I was literally the one who brought them up...  they are expensive, and not that useful compared to their cost right now, or else they would be widely adopted, ESPECIALLY in having portable drone defense.  They are starting to become useful, but obviously if we had focused on them more, earlier, they would be better now.

Or alternatively, the technology wasn't mature enough. There's a reason why the ABs are now having their Phalanx systems removed for ODIN.

&gt;They're not useless.  They're useless in a war with someone who's able to destroy them.  I'd argue they're worse than useless... they are actively detrimental to the war effort, as so many resources were spent on them that could have been spent elsewhere, and so many supporting resources are needed to use them.  

No, they're not. I'd look up Combined Arms.

&gt;We literally can't even cover our own country... yet we have an airforce.  The airforce is much cheaper than some all encompassing defense system , especially for larger nations.  It's the same with missiles.  It's much cheaper to launch missiles than to defend a country against them successfully.  We can easily destroy Russia with our missiles.  But defending against our own missile arsenal (or even lowly Russia's missiles) is borderline impossible... it'd require tens of trillions of dollars(barring some sort of advanced laser defense network of the future).

And neither could the USAF defend the entire USA, especially for a protracted period of time.

&gt;They can be launched from an ACC.  Or they can be launched from pretty much any flat terrain on earth with a few hours of prep and a bulldozer..

One thing I'm worried about is how much like WW1 this is starting to look like. In WW1, technology gave the defender an advantage such that eventually static lines were formed. The conflict turned into a meat grinder that consumed millions. Neither side could give up, because of the immense costs they had already paid. 

In a conflict like this, I could see a similar dynamic forming. Except this time, instead of the static line of engagement arriving ad-hoc through battle, the lines of static engagement just become Russia's borders with Ukraine. 

Imagine the amazingly best case scenario for Ukraine. Let's say they completely drive the Russians out of Ukrainian territory, and they even take Crimea. However, what happens when Ukrainian soldiers reach the border? They can't move on. They can't go all the way to Moscow and physically remove Putin from power. Russia's nuclear arsenal means you can't invade Russia in a way that directly threatens Russia's existence or Putin's power. 

So Ukrainian troops can't set foot on Russian soil, in the same way Russians can't set foot inside NATO soil. However, there's nothing stopping Russia from launching attacks at Ukrainian troops standing on their side of the border. Ukrainian troops can also shoot back, but they can't physically invade. Pretty soon, there are trenches all along the border. Ukrainian forces guard the border, but Russia just keeps sending attacks against them. Ukraine and NATO can't outright invade Russia to remove Putin. And Russia's military isn't powerful enough to push past the border and go back on the offensive. Then consider motivations. 

Putin: has invested his entire dictatorship on the success of this war. With over 20,000 dead already. He's portrayed the war as a battle against absolute evil. He can't just back away.

Ukraine: can't give up, even if they wanted to. They know what will happen to them and their families if they give up. They face cultural genocide and deportation to Siberia. 

NATO: can't give up. After billions spent, western voters will have the heads of politicians if Ukraine loses. NATO citizens have seen the Russian atrocities in Ukraine and will have the will to fight on. NATO leaders will see in this war a chance to topple the Russian regime. With NATO only sending equipment, not troops, NATO citizens don't see their family members being drafted or coming home dead or wounded. 

And so the meat grinder begins. No side can actually conquer the other. NATO can't directly attack Russian population centers or industry. Russia can't invade NATO countries or carpet bomb NATO territory. Each side has an immense motivation to continue the conflict, but neither has the ability to ultimately defeat the other. Instead, they just throw their entire industries and populations against each other and see who breaks first. 

To me, this is starting to look a lot like another WW1.",b94755d5fbaaf837f7485f23ae2a8ce4cf0cda06,True,False,,,,,0,1651043276,,0,{},i6dfk94,False,t3_ucswh2,False,True,t1_i6d61vd,/r/geopolitics/comments/ucswh2/what_if_the_ukraine_victory_scenario_falters/i6dfk94/,1651043289,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651014476.0,

I'm not so sure about this. Russia is in a very weird strategic position right now. NATO supplying heavy artillery to Ukraine is going to make it increasingly more difficult for Russia to find success. If the West can supply adequate anti-air capability to Ukraine, I'm not sure what Russia can accomplish.

&gt;keep in mind this is still a ""special operation"" with very limited troops on the ground!

Russia has approximately 280,000 standing army troops whose offensive potential is organized into 170 BTGs. Most estimates were that Russia had about 120 BTGs deployed for the Ukraine invasion. My point here is that there isn't a massive Russian army somewhere that can be deployed to combat. To get more troops, Russia needs to mobilize, and it will take several months to properly train and equip newly mobilized troops, during which time Ukraine can continue to receive western weapons and training.

Russia is stronger than Ukraine, but I don't think the difference is large enough to overcome failings of Russian military doctrine, serious strategic errors, the advantage Ukraine has as a defender, and the massive amount of economic warfare that the West is engaged in against Russia.",de00feae18a2f5fc3edd4c512dd425a19df32452,True,False,,,,,0,1651042192,,0,{},i6de7bz,False,t3_ucswh2,False,True,t1_i6cr94y,/r/geopolitics/comments/ucswh2/what_if_the_ukraine_victory_scenario_falters/i6de7bz/,1651042207,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651013392.0,

Russia is focused on their current offensive (and defending north of izyum).

Is the author several weeks behind the information cycle? The US's main contribution, and the real game changer IMO, is the real time intelligence they have given Ukraine from the beginning. There is no way the war is going this way without that intel. The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA), or the ""Activity,"" is probably the most secretive Joint Special Operations Command unit in existence and far beyond the capabilities of anything Russia can defend against at the moment. Take that with CIA HUMINT and SIGINT, and the entire Intel Community, these sloppy Russian military units are sitting ducks. 

It's no coincidence that Russian high command (Generals and Colonel equivalents) are getting wiped out. Russia's military doesn't have a non-commissioned officer corps the way the US and many western military units have. Frontline troops are basically all low level enlisted personnel hopelessly dedicated to the officer class of Colonel (and up) equivalents. They are rudderless boats without this leadership. 

&gt;That near real-time intelligence-sharing also paved the way for Ukraine to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of troops in the early days of the war

That was reported today ([https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-russian-plane-carry-rcna26015](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-russian-plane-carry-rcna26015)). I mean that's a level of perceived provocation that I wouldn't have expected pre-war. What are we expecting Washington to do. They've developed and deployed a new generation of drones specifically for Ukraine.
