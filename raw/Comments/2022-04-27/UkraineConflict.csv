It details which companies the Icelandic government is helping in Russia and that the new ambassador has been able to open backchannels for Icelandic companies to get larger contracts. 

It also claims that the Icelandic companies have benefited a lot from the EU companies being hit by sanctions, meaning Russia had to buy more products and services from Iceland.

It also lists a few specialised products which weren't on the EU sanctions so Iceland can benefit and these to Russia without any issues or need for backchannels.

And then the ambassador provided an update after the invasion in [Óljós staða íslenskra tæknifyrirtækja](https://fiskifrettir.is/frettir/oljos-stada-islenskra-taeknifyrirtaekja/173183/)

There he states that the continued operation of Icelandic companies ""secured"" because they are exempt from the new EU sanctions. He also says they are more immune to future sanctions as well, now that they have funded local subsidiaries which are immune from any sanctions. This is probably with the help of the ""backchannels"" he mentioned earlier.

It is not a family name.

People with Icelandic names are properly referred to using their **first name** or their **full name.**  


Referring to Icelandic people with just their last name is in the best case likely to be confusing. To illustrate; in the current Icelandic Parliament which has a total of 63 members there are:  


Three men with the last name *Jóhanns­son.*  
Two men with the last name *Jónsson*.  
Two men with the last name *Einarsson*.  
Three women with the last name *Gunnarsdóttir.*  
Two men with the last name *Gunnarsson*.  
Two women with the last name *Hafsteins­dóttir.*  
Two men with the last name *Friðriksson*.

... and none of them are related, so 25% of this rather small group share a last name with at least one other person who they are not related to.  


Compare that to the 549 current members of the US Congress  


3 men with last name Carter.

2 men, 1 woman with last name Garcia.  
3 men with last name Gonzales.

Imagine being an average Ukrainian citizen who has had to live in fear for the last couple months.   Reminders of victories against the invaders are probably very welcome, even if it's something you already know about.  Especially if it's the sinking of such an important target, you'd expect the Ukrainian leadership to talk that up a bit!  Here they are doing so in a very non-chalant almost Monthy Pythonesque way.  I bet it taps into the Ukrainian approach to humour, although this is a pure guess on my part.  Either way though, read some of their previous releases.  There's one quoted in the article.  IMO they are trying to send signals of ""We've got this"", ""The Russians can be defeated"", as well as giving people a bit to laugh about.   A bit of light-heartedness in a period of crisis.  IMO it projects confidence and a bit of calmness.

Yeah they need it, but they can buy it on the international market just like anyone else. They don't *have* to buy from Russia, but Russia **must** sell to them. That's the part you're missing.

&gt;bang goes your NATO ""solidarity""

NATO solidarity is based on Russian aggression, not temporary economic hurdles.

&gt;Strategically, this is catastrophic for the US.

LOL no it isn't. India has always played both sides, they want access to US markets but rely on Russia for energy and their weapons. This is just a continuation of the status quo.

&gt;Saudi and the UAE - supposedly America's number one foreign ally and dependent have publically told your President to go fk himself

Blatant overstatement. Saudi doesn't like that we call the murder of Kagoshi out. They're mad that we're calling them out. Frankly it doesn't matter - our relationship with Saudi has been strained since we figured out that the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. We're *using* them, they're not our number one foreign ally. We have much closer ties with many other nations, and frankly we'd be happy to see the Al Saud regime fall so long as it took the state religion of Wahabi Islam with it.

&gt;America's sophisticated weapons systems couldn't stop them being chased out of Kabul by cheap AK47s

We left thanks to a treaty signed by Trump. [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html). We weren't chased out, we left due to our agreements with the Afghan government and the Taliban. It was planned long in advance, and the fact that you can't even get your facts straight here is hilarious.

&gt;Yes you invaded on the ground but, on both occassions there was almost literally no Iraqi resistance.

You apparently have no memory... I'm old enough to remember the invasions, both of them. The Iraqi army was the 6th largest in the world in the run up to the 1991 invasion - no resistance my ass. We could also look at the tens of thousands of Iraqi military deaths during the first week of the invasion in 2003. There was plenty of resistance, and that's after weeks of an air campaign that focused on destroying their ability to coordinate and concentrate their forces (both times). Maybe we should talk about the Attack on Karbala, that actually failed, because the Republican Guard managed to repel the attack? Maybe we should talk about the thousands of Iraqi soldiers killed during the fall of Baghdad? The Battle of Debecka Pass (where a numerically inferior US force held off Iraqi mechanized units thanks to Javelins)? The Battle of Norfolk in the 1991 invasion that destroyed almost 400 Iraqi artillery pieces?

Short version: you have no idea what you're talking about and it's easy to demonstrate.

&gt;That's the point - it's not the case with taking on an the Russian army

The Russian army would be *easier* than anything the US has done recently, because we've been planning and strategizing about their capabilities for decades...  and now we see that they're vastly inferior to what we had been preparing for.

&gt;Putin has nearly achieved all of his military objectives

Failed to take Kyiv, failed to take all but one major city, gotten more of his soldiers killed in 2 months of fighting than he lost in the decade of occupation of Afghanistan...  all while demonstrating how hilariously inept their own military is. Remember the Era system, their secure communications system *that requires civilian 3g/4g networks*? Remember how Russia targeted that infrastructure in their opening attacks? And how now their encrypted comms just... don't work? They shot themselves in the foot. Or should we look at that ""convoy"" that was headed for Kyiv a while back that got completely destroyed because it ran out of fuel? The 19th century Mosin rifles being given to their newly drafted forces in the East (as well as the steel helmets that are basically useless)? Their poor logistics that leaves their mechanized units too far forward and out of gas? The lack of any cohesive command structure to coordinate for combined arms? This is amateur hour, and it's hilarious to watch.",1dcb6faf53481f168d8d02fbf1ee4e49662320d7,True,False,,,,,0,1651070094,,0,{},i6elnx3,False,t3_uc5i4z,False,True,t1_i6egq65,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uc5i4z/russia_warns_nuclear_war_risks_now_considerable/i6elnx3/,1651070107,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1651041294.0,

You've missed the point: Russia can no longer sell internationally, because almost all the major international players refuse to buy from them.


&gt;The main driver for that is global pricing just as it is now - just different customers.

So if China and India both decide they won't buy Russian energy at the going market rate, what does Russia have to do? It *needs* to sell. So it will lower the rate. China and India both can just keep saying ""Nah, make it lower"" and Russia will do it, on its knees, begging them to buy. *Begging*. **Groveling**. China and India know this.

&gt;Unfortunately for you, that status is rapidly coming to an end for America, driven by this stupid response to Ukraine.

LOL yeah right.

&gt;In an act of utter humiliation, Biden had to beg Venezuela’s President for oil

Wrong again - Biden ended the embargo of Venezuelan oil in a response to rising gas prices... which has nothing to do with Ukraine. Gas prices were rising steadily before Russian began its illegal invasion, and they're high world-wide. This has nothing to do with Ukraine, or Russia.

&gt;Saudi won’t even agree to meet with Biden to discuss how to improve things.

Of course not - because they *and all of OPEC* are benefitting from the high prices. That's why oil and gas revenues are at record highs. Why would they want to talk to anyone when they're profiting so much from the current situation?

&gt;And it’s no surprise that support in America is strong

LOL how two-faced of you. First you say he's going to lose his election thanks to supporting Ukraine, and then you immediately pivot to ""I'm not surprised"" when faced with evidence showing you're a moron. *Pathetic*.

&gt;Famously, a sizable proportion of you are in favour of beginning bombing on Agrabah - the fictional country in Disney’s Aladdin.

You might want to look up who was polled for that: 30% of GOP voters. Yeah, I agree, conservatives are stupid.

&gt;Ah, that’s right, tour air force who would be shot out of the sky by Russia’s layered air defences

Russia's layered air defenses that can't even stop cheap Turkish drones from wrecking their logistics trains. *Riiiight*... Never mind the fact that the most common Russian AA missile battery is the S-300, the newest iteration of which being over 20 years old. The majority of S-300 systems can't counter stealth, and the S-400 is A.) still old, B.) fielded in low quantities, and C.) the claims of its ""counter-stealth"" capability are dubious at best.

&gt;The only way you get rid of those is invading on the ground first.

Funny, we did pretty well destroying a layered AA network in Iraq semi-recently. What flavor of weapons were they using?

Germany never dictated the price except through a mutually agreed upon trade deal.

Now, however, Russia **HAS** to sell. Energy is the only sector of their economy that isn't completely fucked... and they're down to two major buyers. Those buyers *know this*. They can dictate the price as low as they want, and Russia *has* to accept, because they have nobody else who can buy. It's about *leverage*, and Russia has none. China and India can both buy from the global market, but Russia can't sell on it.

&gt;As you may have noticed the Rouble is actually stronger low than before Biden’s disastrous “nuclear level” sanctions.

That's an effect of Russia's artificial manipulation of their own currency's value. They're burning through their rapidly dwindling foreign cash reserves to make that happen. Meanwhile their stock market is artificially high due to restrictions on who can sell stock, and how much. This is pretty basic stuff, and you either know about it or chose to ignore it... or you're an idiot. I'm not sure which yet.

&gt;As for “term limits” it’s not as though Biden is going to be troubled by them is he?

Germany has agreed to deliver anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine, the German Defense Ministry announced on Tuesday, a move that underscores a major shift in its approach to providing military help to Ukraine.

The commitment to deliver the Gepard anti-aircraft systems was announced by defense minister Christine Lambrecht during a meeting of international defense officials at the Ramstein US Air Force base in Germany on Tuesday.

""We decided yesterday that we will support Ukraine with anti-aircraft systems ... which is exactly what Ukraine needs now to secure the airspace from the ground,"" Lambrecht said during the meeting at the base.

This is significant as it is the first time Germany has agreed to provide this type of heavy weaponry to Ukraine as it fights off the Russian invasion. The Gepard systems were phased out from active duty in Germany in 2010.

Germany initially resisted calls to provide weaponry to Kyiv, agreeing only to provide humanitarian help and medical equipment. That approach was in line with Germany's decades-long policy of not supplying lethal weapons to crisis zone.

Just months before Russian President Vladimir Putin order the invasion into Ukraine, the then new German government agreed to include the restrictive arms export policy into its coalition agreement.

But facing pressure from allies and the German public, the government was forced to overhaul the rules. By late February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced Germany would start delivering some weapons to Ukraine, although at that point he insisted on calling them ""defensive.""

He also announced Germany would start pumping more money into its own armed forces.

First such investment was publicly confirmed last month when Germany announced it would buy 35 US-made F-35A fighter jets.

Just last week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said that while ""other partners are now providing artillery"" to Ukraine, Germany would ""help with training and maintenance.""

Baerbock said that Germany could not provide further weaponry as the country had no weapons it could ""deliver quickly and without delay right now.""

She added that Germany had chosen not to make public all the weapons it had previously sent to Ukraine, but said: ""We have supplied anti-tank weapons, Stingers [air defense systems] and many other weapons that we haven't spoken about in public,"" the minister said.",abaa2517bb00ea146899b0ca1b2a873f68ed7548,True,False,,,,,0,1651035254,,0,{},i6d4b6d,True,t3_ucvkme,False,True,t3_ucvkme,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ucvkme/germany_agrees_to_send_heavy_weapons_to_ukraine/i6d4b6d/,1651035266,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1651006454.0,
