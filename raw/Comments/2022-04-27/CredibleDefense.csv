My question: How does the deployment of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine win the war for Putin?   


Your assumption here is that the deployment of a nuclear weapon secures a victory condition, but even if Russia dropped a nuke on top of Kyiv, it doesn't ""end"" the war. The Ukrainians will not just give up. At the very least, you will face a really brutal guerilla war which you cannot nuke into submission. Even if you keep firing nukes (a truly insane prospect because at that point what are you even conquering?) you can't just end an insurgency via nuclear strikes. Even if the West stop sending weapons to Ukraine as a result, the war will not end, Russians will continue to die, and your resources will continue to dwindle. Add to this the complete diplomatic (and even more brutal economic) isolation of Russia, which would be an almost inevitable outcome of nuclear use, and you're leaving Russia trying to clean up a massive mess without any means of outside support. All of the above assumes that the US and its allies doesn't respond militarily, an even worse case scenario for Russia. Surely, an agreement that ends with limited gains or even a stalemated war in Ukraine is a far better outcome than the above. Hell, even holding the war at established lines for two years and seeing if you can disrupt the American elections is a better option.",2f60e7efa818459a381365ef92d7e396de35925e,True,False,,,,,0,1651103861,,0,{},i6gwjwm,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6g8kpb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gwjwm/,1651103876,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651075061.0,

The tank would be nothing but a target as you cannot just switch seats, a big ass recoil guard as to come off before you can even crawl your way into the gunner's seat. The gunner's position the T-72 is the most cramped position for the entire tank, which is why the gunner has a dedicated hatch unlike most Western tanks. 

&gt; My understanding was that the russian tanks only had thermal imaging on the gunners sight with the possible exception of the T-90's...but they haven't had a lot of those.

Not at all correct. The T-80 command variants as built have thermal... attached to the TC cupola. T-72B3 and T-80BVM have the Sonsa-U thermal gunsight, for which the TC has own screen, along with a thumbstick for tranversing/elevating the turret and fire controls on the T-72. Previous iterations of the T-72 and T-80 have no thermal sight. The T-72's gunner has two periscopes, a TNP-165A and the TNPA-65A, embedded in his hatch. These two periscopes give the gunner a 210 degree field of view, with the dead spot to the rear and rear right of the tank. There is no need to rotate the turret for the gunner to independently locate targets across the frontal arc, it would do very little good since the gunner's primary sight only has a 8 degree horizontal FOV and 8x magnification. The gunner is to use his periscopes, and the TC(in the T-64, 72, 80, and 90) uses his rotating cupola to locate targets and to provide a overview of the situation. 

Again, this would mean that all the older T-72s, from T-72B 1989 and earlier, for which plenty have been destroyed have no reasonable way to fire the main gun(or the coaxial).

First, let's say the US emptied its inventory of javelins tomorrow. Poof. All gone. Any threat to U.S. interests that having a lack of javelins would exacerbate would be one, a threat that needed a large scale anti-armor infantry weapon (meaning the US is likely on the side playing defense), two, would need to be a threat the U.S. couldn't counter with other anti-armor weapons, and flthree, actually exist. 

I'm having a hard time envisioning that threat. Iran - desert warfare with tanks. Abrams carry the day.

I haven't read the latest RAND study on that however. North Korea - their own soldiers may in fact be mostly starving.

Are there any other hostile-to-U.S. interests groups with lots of tanks and that the U.S. may not deploy to crush?

One of the biggest uses of these javelins is exactly for the use we are putting them towards right now - to give them to countries we are on good terms with when we need them to shoot at someone else. As far as U.S. interests go, either the threat will be a country that we are willing to attack, or one that we won't. If we are willing to attack it, the javelin probably won't be a big deal - we will be using everything from drones to aircraft carriers.

The stakes are too high (regime/personal survival) for Putin to do anything else.

I have been saying this for weeks. Our own blind spots prevent us from perceiving this almost inevitable escalation. Since we convinced ourselves that Moscow is waging war for various minor and nebulous goals - the distraction of population, territorial gain etc - we fail to accept the fact that the entire Russian elite perceives this invasion as a war for vital national interests.

Once we understand that, everything else follows. The Russian war situation is deteriorating. Their regular army is outnumbered in Ukraine, and soon might be outequipped. Every their killed professional soldier is irreplaceable.  


Since they cannot afford to lose they must escalate. As you say there are two ways to defeat Ukraine - a national mobilisation and a tactical use of nuclear weapons. Personally, I agree they will try the mobilisation first. However, I think this will be very costly and does not guarantee success. WMDs would probably be a more rational (!) choice, guaranteeing swift victory at a minimum cost for Russia.

I was honestly not trying to be making strawmen and you can look at my statements as a bumbling fool rather than as a sinister barrister. I was quoting from memory and not copy and pasting.

To clarify my statement and directly address the issue:

The US must be prepared to fight a ground war. It is vital to US national security that the US is seen as calculated, willing, and taking appropriately measured steps to be prepared to fight a ground war. To do otherwise is to be seen as weakening US resolve and capability to defend the rules based order. 

The US cannot be seen to simply let a part of its ground warfare capability wither away to levels below what has been calculated as necessary. If it is seen as not having the will, means, or cold logic to fight on land then it will invite aggression towards US allies and for those allies to seek security assurances elsewhere. 

So if the US does give away too many of its Javelins too fast it will be seen by friends and foes alike as a major question in the US security guarantees. If the US instead moves to increase their combat power of its ground forces in other ways, or by rapidly increasing the ATGM stocks, it may go a long way to restoring the military balance and the perception of the US as a security guarantor. 

At the rates specified the US has given away seven years of Javelin stocks so far. At the most economical rate of production it will take a little less than two years to make up that difference. We should be looking to get those capability gaps filled in the mean time. 

And we should be having a reasoned and logical debate about these serious topics so that we can be educated citizens. The best way to become an educated member of the public is to read articles from credible sources about security issues. The front page of this subreddit is a good place to start.

[],False,,kkdogs19,,,[],,,,text,t2_2gcbz9vc,False,False,"&gt;Is it? It seems to me that the sanctions regime is showing the rest of the world that if you actually push the west too far, your economy just implodes, and we can do that overnight.

The problem being that the Russian economy hasn't imploded overnight. The failure of the West to get major players like China and India onboard with sanctions has shown that Western influence over major global economies is limited. It's the lack of implosion of the Russian economy that has led to the West having to prepare for a long-term conflict. 

&gt;That’s a major incentive to not step out of line. Sure, China will try to build their own system, but they already were. China will try to get other countries to join, but China’s system will be much more rigged in its favor than the West’s is.

China already was building their own system, which has been boosted by Western actions have shown the value of being less reliant on the west. I don't think you can honestly say that China's system would be any worse than the Western one, they are likely to be similar.

&gt;So if you’re some small country that isn’t planning on annexing it’s neighbors or genociding some minority group anytime soon, there’s no reason to go lock yourself into the Chinese system and then be completely beholden to them.

The issue is that the West is not consistent on the principles that it chooses to uphold and when it wants to uphold them or turn a blind eye. The different Western responses to Russia's stance on a sphere of influence and Saudi Arabia in Yemen or even Australia in the Solomon Islands is a good example of this. Same issue with the Iran deal. Western ideals change rapidly. It's pretty easy to see why the Chinese system which may be worse in some regards, but more consistant would be attractive hedge option to Western volatility. They also aren't mutually exclusive; countries can be in both systems. 

&gt;The Chinese are still set up on a Russian model, and have even less combat experience. If I was the Chinese leadership, or any of their neighbors, I would have some major questions I’d want answered.  


That's true, but that was always the case for nations that haven't fought wars for prolonged periods. However, military experience isn't everything and the West isn't exactly experienced in fighting the kind of high intensity peer conflict in Ukraine either. 

&gt;Beyond the economics, the world has just seem another very solid example of how poorly a Russian mode military works, in particular how badly corruption and the lack of an NCO class hurts you.

I agree. The deficiencies of the Russian military have been pretty shocking in this conflict, they've humiliated themselves especially in the northern front near Kyiv. 

&gt;That lesson was fairly clear from the Gulf War, but everyone could pretend the Monkey model equipment was worse, that Iraq had worse corruption and army structure problems, and that it’s not like anyone could really stand up to the Americans anyway.

Russian equipment isn't the issue. It's the poor planning that's the issue. Ukraine and Russia have both showed that Soviet Era equipment, like the S-300s actually do work to a good degree. Russia has just been incompetent and that has cost them dearly. Of the tanks 579 tanks Russia has lost only 50% have actually been destroyed by Ukrainian weapons.

Russia being brutal and imposing serfdom upon occupied Ukrainians will only *increase* their animosity towards their Russian occupiers and *will* lead to partisan subterfuge. There are already reports of such things in Kherson and Melitopol. 

Yes, outside of Kyiv, Russian forces have seen relatively more success but even that is being eroded away. Russia skipped Mykolaiv (a city whose capture would be necessary on the road to Odessa) because it was too defended but then got spanked famously hard out of the next town over. Now they're being pushed back to near the outskirts of Kherson. 

They haven't been able to take Kharkiv for months, *a city right on the Russian border*. 

The line running roughly East from Enerhodar to the Donbas has been stagnant for months, and while the Russians have reoriented to going all in on the Donbas and have been making some progress there, it has been marginal and has come at a snail's pace and Ukraine shows no sign of giving up. 

Russia is losing tanks and IFVs FAST. And as the West shows no sign of relenting in supplying Ukraine with the latest state of the art technology, I don't expect that to slow down any time soon. Russia's losses are unsustainable. At the current rate, they're deployment armour won't last through the summer. 

And Russia's ominous 10,000 strong ""reserve"" tank fleet is largely a myth. Careful analysis shows that it's 6,000 at best and *the vast majority* of those are rusted husks in some long forgotten field in Siberia. That doesn't even begin to mention all the time and effort that would be needed to refurbish the fraction of tanks that are salvageable, plus the time required to assemble and amass a new BTG with those tanks. 

They can scrounge up more; but the arduous process means any further additions will come in at a far more manageable trickle for Ukraine. Putin has shot his shot, he opened with his biggest bang in the first week. 

&gt;To me, the way to impact Russia is to focus on their Military/Police state. There are many many ways that this can be achieved by NATO without a direct confrontation. To me, here are the effective ways to impact Russia's military/police states:
&gt;
&gt;* Harass Russia's borders from all locations. One way to do this is to fly aircraft near Russia's borders and force them to scramble jets. This will pin down Russian forces all across Russia and deny them the ability to go to Ukraine. Additionally, build up forces on Russia's borders, so they are forced to deploy forces on their border to defend against attack. 
&gt;* Harass Russia's submarine fleets. Follow them, ping them using helicopters, let them know that their submarines are not safe at sea. 
&gt;* Increase NATO capability. The biggest thing here is to increase anti-ballistic missile capability. Patriot missiles for short range, THAAD for medium, and GMD long range ICBMs.
 &gt;* Attack Russia's infrastructure any way possible. Sanctions, cyber warfare, covert sabotage, export pipeline sabotage, economic warfare, through Ukraine, etc.

You're going to drag us into World War III or, God forbid, nuclear war. These acts will serve to severely provoke Russia. Military next to Russia, fighter jets flying an inch next to Russian airspace, deploying missiles close to Russia, these all provide plausible causus belli for Russia. Heck, the last one is literally the backdrop to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Is it hypocritical? Yes. But when lives are on the line we can't wantonly toy with Russia like this. 

One mistake, Russia shoots down a NATO plane, or sinks a NATO ship and we have another Gulf of Tonkin incident and we're going past a point of no return I don't think any of us can ever truly calculate the repercussions of. Trust me, I am no fan of Russia, but we need to be careful on how we escalate things: we are already doing massive indirect damage to Russia through arming Ukraine and our sanctions, but anything that is seen as fundamentally threatening the integrity of the Russian state would be a dramatic escalation. 

&gt;* Encourage rebellion in Russia's satellite states. This will tie up Russia's military/police state equipment in the satellite states. Georgia and Chechnya are two examples.
&gt;* Increase the heat of the conflict in Syria. Put Assad under pressure so he goes begging to Russia for more support. 

* Chechnya is controlled by Putin's lapdog, Kadyrov. And for however much his militia is one of TikTok propaganda, he certainly won't let his personal fiefdom go down that easily. The man operates a dictatorship within a dictatorship in Chechnya. 

* Georgia's military is too weak to launch an offensive to retake Abkhazia and South Ossetia, even with a distracted Russia. Russia would need to be fundamentally compromised as a state for Georgia to even have a hope in hell of doing this. 

* As much as I hate Assad, the Syrian Opposition has lost; they are slowly being strangled away in the rump quasi-state they still hold. The only angle here may be Rojava/the SDF, but their main objective is the liberation of Kurdish lands, geographically limiting them in scope, plus, Turkey has permanently impacted themselves along Syria's border with Turkey (thanks to a certain US President's short-sighted move...), severely complicating the matter. 

And similarly to what I said before: prodding these conflicts will only provoke Russia further and represent a drastic escalation. 

&gt;* Continue to heavily support Ukraine - slowly more effective weapons/training. That'll have a direct impact on Russia's military capability. Especially as more sophisticated NATO weapons show up like predators or precision guided artillery/rockets. 
&gt;* Continue the propaganda war in Russia using cyber warfare 
&gt;* Increase oil/gas/renewable/nuclear supplies to Europe to decrease the dependence on Russian fossil fuels. 
&gt;* Take a heavy hand on Russia's ability to project power internationally. Specifically in counterintelligence and counter propaganda efforts. 

So these ones are the most realistic and the ones that I'd support. 

We need to fight fire with fire, there should be American ""trolls"" on the internet breaking into Russian echo chambers and spreading the truth to these people. 

We need to set up massive, powerful radio broadcast towers in Finland, Estonia, Georgia, South Korea, and Japan that can reach as far into Russia territory as possible. 

And if I'm the Chancellor of Germany, I'm immediately signing an order to reactivate nuclear power plants. I work to expedite the construction of an upgraded LNG terminal at our Northern ports. If I'm the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, I also do the same work to upgrade the LNG capabilities of the Port of Rotterdam as quickly as possible.

The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and members of NATO and the EU need to form a taskforce on how to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels as rapidly as possible. In the meantime, Canada and the United States should increase the production of oil and gas and export to European markets, and Europe should finally pull the plug.",a2dae7f5f064b08b1ff92f50d3b426e699d80b6c,True,False,,,,,0,1651099623,,0,{},i6gnjay,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6f8591,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gnjay/,1651099634,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651070823.0,

There are people in the US national security apparatus whose job it is to plan and prepare for potential conflicts. These are people who work in intelligence and military functions. The analyst from CSIS could be considered as representing this cadre even if he is retired and writing for a think tank. 

When they forecast potential conflicts it is the job of these analysts to have contingency strategies to deal with them. Being seen as prepared for conflicts is a critical part of deterrence, not just for our adversaries but for our allies as well. 

I am sure that many people have heard of the stated US need to be ready and prepared to fight two major wars at once. This is a metric of need that is laid out for these planners to prepare for. This is how a certain number of soldiers is arrived at is necessary, and where to put them, for example. This is a foundation of US national security strategy that does not just protect US national security, but ensures allies that it has planned for and prepared to defend them as well. 

If the US is seen as unwilling or unable to meet its commitments to allies then some of these allies may turn to alternative means for ensuring their own national security. These alternative measures could include starting nuclear weapons programs. The Republic of China is an example of a US ally that once had a clandestine nuclear weapon program, it was terminated after the US found out about it. 

It could also include bending to the will of aggressor nations, and leaving the rules based order. This could be seen in something like the case of Finland where it was unable to have a truly independent foreign policy because of the threat the Soviet military had over it. This is sometimes pejoratively called *Finlandization*. 

Allies as well as adversaries of the US and the rules based order are constantly looking for weakness in US military capability and resolve to meet security challenges. So if the US is seen as slipping in its capabilities to fight a land war to defend an ally, any ally, then it will have major consequences around the world. 

I have seen experts who have traveled to South Korea, Japan, and the Baltics all say that they have been taken aside and asked earnestly: *'will the US really defend us??'* For the national security apparatus of US allies the question of US will and capability is ever present on their minds. 

I am not saying that one program or weapon here or there is the most vital, or only way to accomplish a military requirement. However these weapons and programs are part of a larger military planning that has been enacted to give the US the required level of combat power to deter aggression against ourselves and our allies. 

There are doubtlessly many here who have heard of the phrase or sentiment of *'No more Task Force Smiths'*. This is mantra that references the disastrous Task Force Smith who tried very unsuccessfully to resist the People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) from conquering South Korea and the entire Korean peninsula. This mantra is about giving US service people the required training and tools to effectively fight aggression in potential conflict zones, and not leave them to die helplessly while making the US and its security guarantees look weak. This is an article that seems at first glance to reference this idea.

https://fixbayonets.us/no-more-task-force-smiths-a-reappraisal/

One part of this failed attempt to resist North Korea was the T-34 Soviet tanks they were using could not be penetrated by US anti armor weapons. It was only several weeks after the outbreak of the war that larger bazookas (3.5 inch I think) were rushed to the front in record time. A complete rout was averted on the peninsula by being able to slow down the Norks and holding on outside of Pusan. 

So you see the US does need to plan and prepare for a wide range of contingencies that includes having an adequate supply of anti-tank weapons to defeat enemy armor. The need for an appropriate supply of ATGMs is in fact a big deal, and there are absolutely people watching for any chinks in the armor at all times.",556f98afed248e7a227b92f5fc644e947545c8e4,True,False,,,,,0,1651099168,,0,{},i6gmis4,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6g3j6p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gmis4/,1651099184,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651070368.0,

[],False,,AluminumSoldier,,,[],,,,text,t2_oy54s,False,False,"I’m also doubtful that mobilization would allow Russia to outright win the war against Ukraine, especially while Ukraine is receiving Western equipment, training, and intelligence. That said, I do disagree with a few of your points. First, regarding conscripts, I think Putin is willing to both send many before they are adequately trained, as cannon fodder, and commit to the 3-6 months that it would take to train them. He’d likely do both at the same time with different groups. Mobilization, by definition, would be committing Russia to a conflict of greatly increased timeframe. 


As far as public opinion goes, I am not certain. I think the average Russian’s commitment to the idea of Russian exceptionalism likely exceeds the average American’s commitment to the idea of American exceptionalism. They government, their religion, their history books, and their peers are tell them that they have a special destiny and purpose as a people group. They have not come to terms with their imperial past in a meaningful way. We often hear the fall of the Soviet Union described as a tragedy and humiliation, but not as a point for self-reflection. I think, in many ways, this conflict is being sold as a war for the soul of the Russian people and their special destiny. If the Ukrainians are willing to leave that behind, as a people, then what do they have? It’s much easier for the Russians to believe it’s the work of the CIA, Nazis, and gay people then to face the fact that Ukraine has left the “Russian World” behind. All that to say that I think public opinion on Russia could be galvanized to support mobilization with the right rhetoric. 


For equipment, yes, they are losing a lot, and their ability to manufacture more is limited. But they have a lot. It’s not in good condition, but if it can move and shoot, the Russians will use it. They can cannibalize what won’t run to make other things work. They can use what they capture from Ukraine. I’ll admit, I don’t know how long this will be sustainable, but I don’t think they’ll run out of materiel soon enough for it to impact mobilization. 


Finally, I think that Putin will not accept a certain death/regime failure over a possible one. Any admission of defeat would lead to regime failure.

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"&gt; I wonder if we will start to see new designs in the next few years due to increased military budgets in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.

I think so. There are a lot of trends happening at once that strongly suggest rethinking tank design. (note for the inevitable, rethink, not eliminate)

APS systems are likely to become seen as mandatory. At that point, it makes sense to optimize the armor layout around the system's potential strengths and flaws.

An APS essentially forces you to have 360 optical and short range radar sensors. If you've got those anyhow, why not make them good enough to have a DAS like capability. I recall seeing at least one article about a project a couple years ago exploring giving infantry soon to be dismounts AR views to be able to just see through the vehicle (to an extent). That's gotta be a huge jump in situational awareness in really occluded environments, which is also where a tank is very vulnerable.

Some of this technology has been getting both better and cheaper rather dramatically in the last decade. The race for a self driving car has caused an explosion in mm wave phased arrays for example.

I'd also say an effector for small drones is going to be mandatory too. This could take a ton of forms, but might rethink things like a coaxial machine gun vs something with bigger time of flight fuzed shells. Or maybe it's a cheap mini missile that uses the tank's sensors for command guidance? Perhaps that munition is the same as the APS one? Or maybe we put a laser on it? Lots of interesting near term possibilities here imo.

Again, a laser is an example of something where you get to double dip on value. The sailors on the Ponce emphasized how just having the telescope imagery from the beam director was very useful.

If we've got all this sensory awareness, why not take the thinking of Armata and Merkava even further? Put the troop compartment at the rear of the vehicle, separated turret with autoloader in middle, and prime mover in front, operate via screens or HMD.

I think there's a lot of things like this all coming together at one moment that are going to change the way tanks are designed pretty heavily, while still being within the basic mobility/firepower/protection conception of a MBT today.",74d78cdabbd622691c8d4a03fd738c1122877b0f,True,False,,,,,0,1651097461,,0,{},i6gio3z,False,t3_ud6pvv,False,True,t1_i6f6i8s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud6pvv/technical_reflections_on_russias_armoured/i6gio3z/,1651097472,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651068661.0,

The US doesn't need to completely run out of Javelins to be a major security risk, we need a basic issue plus stockpiles to get us through a certain period. So let's say there are currently three BCTs in EUCOM and plan is to get five more within a month, we need that many Javelins. If we don't, the plan doesn't work.

If we don't have necessary stockpiles so we can fight our wars then who is bailing us out the way we're bailing out Ukraine? Canada? UK? Enquiring minds would like to know.

&gt;It would be less convenient but the way the US would wage a ground war - largely - wouldn't be with individual soldiers, on the ground, blowing up enemy armor with shoulder fired weapons.

We didn't buy thousands of Javelins to give them to Ukraine or other proxies, we bought them because they're part of the weaponry our organizations and doctrine calls for to fight. We can give some away without it endangering ourselves and even more than some in the US Army or Marines might be comfortable with, but we can't give out all of them. 

&gt;but the US would destroy the vast majority of enemy armor the way we have for the past 40 years - with our air power, our predator drones, and with ship launched cruise missiles

Air power didn't kill nearly as many AFV during ODS as you think, and didn't do better in other wars in the last 40 years where enemy armor was a threat.

Basically, very basic tank tactics required to be situationally aware and ready to respond to attacks are *not* being used by the Russians. 

As you drive a road your formation should face its turrets (and so sensors and viewing ports) so as to cover 360 degrees around the column. You may be able to detect enemy units before they fire, and if there is an attack you don't spot first, at least 1 tank should be directly looking in that direction and so be able to see where it came from and respond immediately with fire. Other tanks can then orientate to the threat the ""lookout"" who saw the activity in that direction spotted. Either move to a better defensive position given that angle of attack, or offensively to engage it.

Also, when a tank formation parks it should do so either side of the road (exposing only half the formation to an attack from that side) and making the whole formation harder to attack from either the front or rear (rather than just standing out like numpties atop the road) and again rotate turrets to use sensors and be ready to retaliate immediately to an attack.

Like this

https://imgur.com/7aXNPQh

When you watch ANY russian tank formation they do not do this. They don't ever do any of this. Not even just the simple ""rotate the turrets"".

When driving they roll down a road with every single turret facing straight ahead, even if that means their sensors are looking at nothing more than the arse of the tank in front.

Then, when they stop..... they all just sit slap bang in the middle of the road and STILL all point their turrets straight ahead.... and just freaking sit there like big fat blind targets.

Consequently, when they inevitably get ambushed.... they also very often clearly have no idea where the attack came from either.... because no one was looking in that direction through their sensors.

Once you see it (and it took that thread to clue me in on it) you can't unsee it.

Various commenters assert that Russia needs to be delivered a partial success since Putin has backed himself into a corner and is likely to deploy weapons of mass destruction unless offered a face-save (a la Sun Tzu's ""golden bridge""). Other commenters point out that, perhaps aside from access to Crimea's port for military use, Russia has no existential interests in Ukraine (and perhaps not even in Crimea), so Putin isn't cornered and can leave at any time.

I don't think anyone knows Putin's concerns about failure. Some claim Putin has staked his legitimacy on success in Ukraine but we don't know how well he could simply pivot his propaganda. Even without pivoting propaganda, he might weather a spectacular failure, eliminate anyone who threatens him internally, and continue trundling on. Alternatively, he could negotiate asylum with, say, the USA, and live out his days in comfort. It seems a misuse of metaphor to describe Putin's predicament as being similar to that of a dangerous animal backed into a corner. He may have thwarted ambitions but he has multiple avenues to arrange a comfortable retirement.

As a thought experiment, consider if North Korea/China staked its legitimacy on taking over South Korea/Taiwan and threatened nukes if the West continued to support South Korea/Taiwan, would one similarly also recommend we abandon South Korea/Taiwan? To me, such situations are not dissimilar to Russia's threats and the answer is clearly no.

Unlike some Redditors who relish a nuclear exchange with Russia, I recognize the importance of avoiding such escalation, but it appears that appeasement would only defer conflict and ultimately cause more death and destruction. Biden appears to be maintaining a conventional proxy battle (similar to provocations in which Russia has frequently engaged) and [committed to a proportionate response if Russia escalates to weapons of mass destruction](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/biden-says-us-would-respond-to-russia-if-putin-uses-chemical-or-biological-weapons.html), which seems appropriate.

There are subtleties to be decided such as to what extent to provide equipment with which Ukraine may attack Russian military assets in Russia, Belarus, DNR/LNR, and Crimea, especially military assets that are supporting Ukraine's invasion. Ukraine's current restraint may be to avoid providing Russia a pretext for a general mobilization. However, Russia may anyway mobilize, removing the basis for such restraint.",e1cd6a66854dfe61ea1ff1d60c5d0956ecf7ce8c,True,False,,,,,0,1651095935,,0,{},i6gf4n1,False,t3_ublttg,False,True,t3_ublttg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6gf4n1/,1651095951,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651067135.0,

What we have seen from the Russians: a willingness to target civilians for terror purposes, railway lines and depots, oil depots, command and control sites, government buildings, radar and airport/aircraft infrastructure, bridges, military factories, civilian factories, schools, theaters, hospitals, and universities.

I don’t think the Russians are, at this point, holding back conventional capabilities that they have in-theater. I could be wrong, of course, but after it became clear that the Ukrainians weren’t just gonna lie down and let them win, I think they committed all the resources and capabilities they had on hand.

They need a certain amount, theoretically, to protect their borders and fulfill their other security obligations both within and outside of the country. I’ve seen a lot of talk that they are likely preserving some of their precision munitions for a potential war with NATO. Everybody is asking where their Air Force is, but that might be a question of ability at this point.

&gt; Ukraine overruns the depleted remnants of Russian forces with relative ease.

It’s what we’re all hoping to see, but I think it’s foolish to expect. Russian military performance has been very poor, but defending is significantly easier than attacking (at a tactical-operational level).

This scenario also presents the biggest risk of a major escalation like WMDs due to the confusion and speed of advance it would involve.

&gt; Ukrainian forces make slow but steady progress over the course of many months.

The balance of forces on paper leads me to think this is the most likely outcome, although there are plenty of unknowns that could influence each side’s performance.

For instance: how long will Ukrainian commanders wait before launching their attacks? Go too soon and they risk committing the same mistake that Russia is currently, go too late and they risk letting the Russians regroup and dig in.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Just a few comments to add, as I've been reading a lot of about BTG organization and the Russian manpower system for a bit before and since the war started. 

BTG are used as a formal tactical unit not only for actual doctrinal reasons but primarily because of low manning: brigades and regiments are often not up to strength, so a brigade that should have three BTGs is actually ""supposed"" to have two with the third to be filled with reservists in a time of war, but in reality they often only had only one full strength BTG by ensuring what they was actually present in the brigade (or regt) at least fills the one BTG. Not 100%, because that's basically impossible, but close. So if a Russian unit is at 70%, I seriously doubt that's uniform down to the squad level. It almost never is.

Supposedly the second and in a few cases third BTGs if each bde/rgt were brought up to strength before the invasion by a partial reserve mobilization that they did in late 2021, as well as a certain number of conscripts that might be used in combat roles, though that's pretty uncertain at this point. I don't have exact numbers, as the sources about conscripted combat arms is biased and I can't find the news articles that mentioned the 2021 reservist mobilization (going by memory I think it was roughly 60,000 called up around Nov-Dec).

When it comes to assuming strength of BTGs even before the war started this can be an exercise in futility. Only one prewar BTG per bde/regt should be close to full strength but there is no way to know which bde/regt had a second BTG and at what strength, let alone a third. And that's before they got plussed up before the invasion, when there was a concerted effort to get more BTGs to mass outside Ukraine. Were those extra bodies going to try to fully fill up existing BTGs to as close to 100% manning as possible, or were they being used to create entirely new BTGs, probably the third BTG in every bde/regt so they didn't need to strip other military districts of existing units? We'll probably not know for a while, if at all. 

We do know all RuGD, VDV, MP, and Spetsnaz still require conscripts for certain jobs involving support, which is confusing since their manpower system relies on them but legislatively they are not supposed to deploy in foreign conflicts outside specific declared emergency situations/declaration of wars. Their system of recruitment, training, manning would allow them to slide those into combat arms, but from my understanding most brass do not want conscripts as combat arms, contract troops are just much better, if for no other reason than they're serving for at least two years instead of one.

Having myself done combat ops working with APC type vehicles at well less than full strength I don't think they'd run a APC and squad with only two dismounts, which would likely be the case from being understaffed before and since the war has been going on from losses both combat and non-combat. Not only is it very tactically unsound but it makes sense to amalgamate the squads in a platoon, especially since for whatever reason there will be APC that break down so they'd need to do that anyways. Plus, godforbid the lieutenant platoon leader is gone, with no platoon sergeant position existing in the Russian military, without a strong and senior squad leader who can effectively step up to be the acting PL, it means platoons need to get amalgamated together, also to bring companies back to a semblance of order. Worse off companies with more officers lost and less NCOs and working APCs in that scenario might even be effectively disbanded to backfill other companies to bring them up to strength too. 

Note, these measures are often done informally in combat units who don't have an effective replacement system for manpower and equipment but are also often used before going into combat by units who wish to have a limited number of full strength maneuver units versus a lot of partial strength ones of limited tactical value.",9aea907410e69c08368e7aefbfd7b7658b37a41b,True,False,,,,,0,1651095284,,0,{},i6gdl6j,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6g39o8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gdl6j/,1651095297,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651066484.0,

That’s a major incentive to not step out of line. Sure China will try to build their own system, but they already were. China will try to get other countries to join, but China’s system will be much more rigged in its favor than the West’s is.

So if you’re some small country that isn’t planning on annexing it’s neighbors or genociding some minority group anytime soon, there’s no reason to go lock yourself into the Chinese system and then be completely beholden to them.

Beyond the economics, the world has just seem another very solid example of how poorly a Russian mode military works, in particular how badly corruption and the lack of an NCO class hurts you.

That lesson was fairly clear from the Gulf War, but everyone could pretend the Monkey model equipment was worse, that Iraq had worse corruption and army structure problems, and that it’s not like anyone could really stand up to the Americans anyway.

Ukraine is showing that none of that is true, and even a fairly poor nation only just setting it’s military up on Western lines will wreck a Russian model one.

The Chinese are still set up on a Russian model, and have even less combat experience. If I was the Chinese leadership, or any of their neighbors, I would have some major questions I’d want answered.

Are our equipment capabilities as overstated as the Russians? Because overstating capabilities and then having the Americans build to match those fictional capabilities clearly doesn’t work out.

How much of our equipment actually exists, instead of just on paper and as an apartment in Vancouver? How much of it is actually maintained? I would not want to be a Chinese quartermaster right now.

How much has the PLA been crippled due to it being built for regime survival rather than winning wars?

Lastly, can we solve the whole lack of an NCO class problem? The answer is of course, through a whole of society transformation into a much less authoritarian model, that encourages independent thought and initiative, and has more of a middle class. So they can become the West in order to defeat it, in which case problem solved.

I can’t see how yet another example of how the authoritarian military model does against the democratic one, and proof of just how economically dominating the west is, is a reason to think that prospects are looking better for China.

[],False,,taw,,,[],,,,text,t2_iiun,False,False,"&gt; I think Russia is likely to try escalating the conventional conflict through mobilization

Russia can't do this. Here are the reasons:

* mobilization takes time, 3-6 months for freshly mobilized troops to hit the frontlines. Ukraine started mobiliazation immediately, and the expectations is that these new units will start making a difference late May, or June, and this is basically lightning speed. Ukraine pretty much won the war, without benefiting from mobilization at all, just with its preexistent army, and maybe some TDF extras. If Putin starts mobilizing now, the mobilized troops would hit the frontlines by late summer at the earliest, more likely autumn. Any earlier than that and they're basically cannon fodder, good only at absorbing bullets so that real soldiers get shot at less.
* [Russia is losing equipment at insane rate and there's no replacement for it](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-42/). By the time fresh conscripts would hit the frontlines, there's no equipment for them beyond technicals and AK74s.
* mobilization would be extremely politically risky. Russian imperialists are racist af, and they don't care about murdered Ukrainians, they don't care about [Buryats, Chechens, Syrians, ""separatists"", or whatnot](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1506479259866394625) dying for their empire, but if Putin starts sending Russian kids to die in his wars, he could end up like Gaddafi

What's most likely going to happen is Russia will try its Donbas offensive for the next month, maybe two, likely achieving very little. Then it will start losing ground, and essentially will have to offer limited surrender and hope Ukraine takes it. Most likely it will keep its unrecognized occupation of Crimea but it will throw Donbas (and possibly Transnistria under the bus).

There are other possible scenarios - maybe Russians do much better than expected, and Ukraine accepts Feb 23 lines (that's about most optimistic scenario for Russia without being completely delusional); or Russia keeps fighting to the last drop of Chechen blood, and it ends up without Crimea, with Lukashenko overthrown, and even Georgia getting its territories back (in would be really stupid if they do, but they did a lot of stupid things).",5d6187c9a8147b8fd5a9505a8ce4ce4e97a88d7b,True,False,,,,,0,1651094662,,0,{},i6gc3bu,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6g8kpb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6gc3bu/,1651094673,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651065862.0,

I see the same thing happening now.

[],False,,AluminumSoldier,,,[],,,,text,t2_oy54s,False,False,"I think that Russia is unlikely to achieve any of their long-term political/strategic goals in Ukraine with their current forces. I believe that their military position in the country is likely to degrade over the coming weeks, not improve. As they continue to lose manpower, their ability to hold ground could become untenable, even as they make gains. I do not think, however, that Russia is likely to give up or even meaningfully revise their war aims. 


Therefore, I am increasingly concerned about escalation in Ukraine. Mike Mazzar covers most of what I’m feeling in [this thread.](https://twitter.com/mmazarr/status/1519160793790656513?s=21&amp;t=Q7fXpswuSthItqmUXv9hRQ)While I believe that continuing and increasing support for Ukraine is both morally correct and essential for maintaining Atlantic security in the face of a revisionist power, the most likely result at this point, at my opinion, is that Russia decides to escalate further, either through mobilization or the deployment of WMDs or another dramatic move to up the stakes of the war and intimidate the West. The stakes are too high (regime/personal survival) for Putin to do anything else.


(As an aside, I think Russia is likely to try escalating the conventional conflict through mobilization before committing to unconventional warfare. That said, if mobilization still didn’t produce the results that it wants, and I personally doubt that it would, the use of WMDs would still be more likely than de-escalation on Russia’s part.)


Likewise, the collective West is unlikely to back down in the face of Russian threats, because they recognize that a Russian success in Ukraine would only be the beginning of Russia’s threat to their security. Further, it would be ideologically/morally untenable to abandon Ukraine to its fate when we’ve seen a taste of what that would look like in Bucha and Mariupol.


In other words, the escalation of commitment and rhetoric on both sides (though mostly Russian, let’s be clear) has potentially limited the possible outcomes of the conflict to maximalist ones. Ukraine and the West wish to see a sovereign Ukraine, free and whole. Russia wants Ukraine as a vassal state or integral part of the country. It’s not clear to me that any “compromise” over the status of Ukraine is possible or acceptable to either side. 


At this point, all meaningful negotiations over the outcomes of the war are being conducted by armed combatants in the Donbass. But I don’t think a victory by either side there will lead to the end of the war. If Russia wins, they will likely try to push further into Ukraine. If they lose, they will double down once again in some way. I can’t think of an outcome short of total victory that the Russians would take at this point that would not simply be a chance to prepare for further aggression.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"&gt;Truth be told, I don't understand why people keep trying to make Putin out to be the next Kim Jong-Un. That plays right into his hands.

Discourse in Western democracies *in general* is not all that nuanced when it comes to authoritarian dictatorships. It should be abundantly clear to anyone who has ever spent time in Russia (or China for that matter) that it has extraordinarily little in common with North Korea. Even the differences between life in Petersburg vs Shanghai are striking, to say the least. 

We tend to paint authoritarian regimes with a broad brush, which, in my view, puts us at a disadvantage when we think about competition with those regimes. It's very *rare* that leaders in the modern era go ""crazy"" outside of a few sub-saharan African states that have relatively weak central governance and where the only barrier to leadership is violence (there's a lot of different reasons for this that I won't go into in detail here, but if you want to read about how these systems emerge check out ""[How is Power Shared in Africa](https://econ.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/06/pdf_paper_patrick_francois_how_power_shared_africa.pdf)"" for a good overview). 

My view of Putin is that he is behaving rationally but has *terrible* access to reliable information. I suppose the ultimate outcome of this is decisionmaking that appears irrational from the outside, but this differs from, say, an Imperial Japan in 1930 that had such a dysfunctional, irrational system of governance that irrational decisionmaking was almost inevitable. Anyway this is the nuanced stuff of academia. I think to answer your broader question, portraying our adversaries as KJU-esque is a signal to Putin that we will treat him not as the ""great power peer"" he wishes, but as a pariah state. It's also a key signal to the Chinese, and in particular the global south (not my favourite term) that we should push for isolation with regards to Russia.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Just a few comments to add, as I've been reading a lot of about BTG organization and the Russian manpower system for a bit before and since the war started. 

BTG are used as a formal tactical unit not only for actual doctrinal reasons but primarily because of low manning: brigades and regiments are often not up to strength, so a brigade that should have three BTGs is actually ""supposed"" to have two with the third to be filled with reservists in a time of war, but in reality they often only had only one full strength BTG by ensuring what they was actually present in the brigade (or regt) at least fills the one BTG. Not 100%, because that's basically impossible, but close. So if a Russian unit is at 70%, I seriously doubt that's uniform down to the squad level. It almost never is.

Supposedly the second and in a few cases third BTGs if each bde/rgt were brought up to strength before the invasion by a partial reserve mobilization that they did in late 2021, as well as a certain number of conscripts that might be used in combat roles, though that's pretty uncertain at this point. I don't have exact numbers, as the sources about conscripted combat arms is biased and I can't find the news articles that mentioned the 2021 reservist mobilization (going by memory I think it was roughly 60,000 called up around Nov-Dec).

When it comes to assuming strength of BTGs even before the war started this can be an exercise in futility. Only one prewar BTG per bde/regt should be close to full strength but there is no way to know which bde/regt had a second BTG and at what strength, let alone a third. And that's before they got plussed up before the invasion, when there was a concerted effort to get more BTGs to mass outside Ukraine. Were those extra bodies going to try to fully fill up existing BTGs to as close to 100% manning as possible, or were they being used to create entirely new BTGs, probably the third BTG in every bde/regt so they didn't need to strip other military districts of existing units? We'll probably not know for a while, if at all. 

We do know all RuGD, VDV, MP, and Spetsnaz still require conscripts for certain jobs involving support, which is confusing since their manpower system relies on them but legislatively they are not supposed to deploy in foreign conflicts outside specific declared emergency situations/declaration of wars. Their system of recruitment, training, manning would allow them to slide those into combat arms, but from my understanding most brass do not want conscripts as combat arms, contract troops are just much better, if for no other reason than they're serving for at least two years instead of one.

Having myself done combat ops working with APC type vehicles at well less than full strength I don't think they'd run a APC and squad with only two dismounts, which would likely be the case from being understaffed before and since the war has been going on from losses both combat and non-combat. Not only is it very tactically unsound but it makes sense to amalgamate the squads in a platoon, especially since for whatever reason there will be APC that break down so they'd need to do that anyways. Plus, godforbid the lieutenant platoon leader is gone, with no platoon sergeant position existing in the Russian military, without a strong and senior squad leader who can effectively step up to be the acting PL, it means platoons need to get amalgamated together, also to bring companies back to a semblance of order. Worse off companies with more officers lost and less NCOs and working APCs in that scenario might even be effectively disbanded to backfill other companies to bring them up to strength too. 

Note, these measures are often done informally in combat units who don't have an effective replacement system for manpower and equipment but are also often used before going into combat by units who wish to have a limited number of full strength maneuver units versus a lot of partial strength ones of limited tactical value.",9aea907410e69c08368e7aefbfd7b7658b37a41b,True,False,,,,,0,1651091932,,0,{},i6g5azo,False,t3_ud9msx,False,True,t3_ud9msx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud9msx/russian_infantry_manning_levels_and_prospects_for/i6g5azo/,1651091943,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651063132.0,

A while ago Putin insisted the EU pay for gas in rubles, or it would be cut off.

Most european nations refused (Hungary and Austria the only two exceptions).

Yesterday, citing refusal to pay in Rubles, Russia cut off gas supplied to Poland and Bulgaria.

Poland had been overtly providing Ukraine weapons for a while, but officially/openly Bulgaria had not (although there had been a handful of suspicious looking flights between sofia and rezscow that might have landed rather heavily)

&gt;Major shake-up in Bulgaria, as the leading coalition partner - previously seen as dependent on the ""pacifist"" president Radev - took a clear pro-Ukraine stance today and attacked the president in ""presuming that Russia will win this war, while we think Ukraine will win""

&gt;The main party in Parliament, PP, unexpectedly emancipated from the president, said it will vote in favor of direct and open arms sales to Ukraine - to be voted in parliament on Monday.

So..... the previously neutral main party, in retaliation for the gas cut-off, now seems to be willing to vote to openly send arms to Ukraine.

Why should we care, you may ask ? Poor little Bulgaria, what can they send ?

Well, they happen to be by far the largest manufacturer of Ex-Soviet military kit in the EU, having 4 different companies that all produce Ex-Soviet stuff ranging from small arms, artillery, anti-air, BM-21s, Armoured Vehicles and, critically, have large production facilities for producing the *ammunition for all of the above*.

They also have a lot of expertise in repairing/maintaining these systems Ukraine might find useful.... and potentially could also have large stockpiles on hand ready for immediate export.

We'll have to wait and see how the vote goes, but it looks like Putin may have overplayed his hand a little here. In Bulgaria the PM/Cabinet hold the actual executive power so..... with at least 3 of the four companies able to produce 152mm ammunition at their factories it looks likely that Bulgaria will be able to fully open the 152mm spigots (and potentially all the rest) next week.",0ce5b4625273c3a4ed30e6e9486dd9908cdb3b03,True,False,,,,,0,1651091536,,0,{},i6g4afh,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t3_ud1voz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6g4afh/,1651091551,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651062736.0,

[],False,,RevolutionaryPanic,,,[],,,,text,t2_s4x5r4h,False,False,"I've listened to excellent War on The Rocks podcast featuring Michael Kofman ([https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/ukraines-military-advantage-and-russias-stark-choices/](https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/ukraines-military-advantage-and-russias-stark-choices/) ) , in which he speaks on some of the reasons why we are not seeing effective combined arms tactics utilized by the Russian army in Ukraine. Some salient points he raises are:

    Russian army operates at peacetime at 70% manning levels. Putin has made a conscious decision of not mobilizing Russian army to war levels. The decision to release current conscript cohort indicates that they do not see themselves mobilizing in short term at least.
    
    Of the 70% combat strength, further ~30% are conscripts which are in general (though, as we seen, not always) are not deployable. The result is that a brigade with 3000 people has about 1100 -1300 people deployable, resulting in at most 2 generatable BTG. Even those BTGs are deploying considerably understrength, from high of 85% of manning down to 60-70% of manning in some.
    
    Motor rifle battalions deploy with about 300 men (of 600-700 men in BTG). In a motor rifle company, that results in about 60-70 soldiers. That amount of people is further spread across vehicle crews, resulting in BMPs which nominally hold 8 men going into combat with 6 men. Of those 3 are vehicle crews, resulting in 3 dismounts. In a brigade with 70% manning level it would go down to 2 people. That is dismally low and comparable to unit that has already taken severe casualties in combat - before it saw first shot fired. Parenthetically, it also explains why Ukrainians are frequently able to score hits on parked vehicles without any reaction - it's because they are occupied only by a few people or possibly none.
    
    Russians have attempted to compensate for this initial lack of infantry, and casualties in Ukraine by tapping various non-MoD forces, primarily:
    
        Rosgvardia
    
        Chechens
    
        Syrians etc.
    
        Enhanced recruiting of contract soldiers
    
    None of the forces above result in high quality infantry. As peacetime contract soldiers are attrited, quality of Russian forces is likely to decline.

Given all that, what are the prospects for Russian military in Ukraine? Per Michael Kofman's assessment, after the current Russian offensive finishes - win, lose or draw - Russians do not have enough forces for another offensive for at least several months. At that point, Russians either have to accept inability to achieve their objectives and try to hang on to their occupied territory - or escalate by declaring mass mobilization.

It's not clear to me to what extent mobilization will solve Russian force crisis. Russia has very limited amount of what we consider ""ready reserves"" ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/explainer-russian-conscription-reserve-and-mobilization](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/explainer-russian-conscription-reserve-and-mobilization)) , people who engage in regular and frequent military training. Most people mobilized from reserves will have had no combat experience, nor any military training for years. To that, you have to add unclear prospects for generating combat equipment from storage facilities. It's seems likely to me that these mobilized units will have fairly limited combat potential for a few months after creation.",0f5880d93ffbca7cb345c385bd2d638fef36ba33,True,False,,,,,0,1651091140,,0,{},i6g39o8,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t3_ud1voz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6g39o8/,1651091156,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651062340.0,

Being able to kill an oligarch isn't the same as being able to kill every oligarch. Those that have been assassinated have typically placed themselves in vulnerable positions such as leaving their houses to holiday. Even a state as autocratic as Russia continues to exist only because of laws and norms - if Putin suddenly felt it necessary to exert that kind of control over the oligarchs then it immediately creates concern among all elements of society regarding their own security. There is also then the issue of inheritance where suddenly either unknown elements are suddenly empowered and simultaneously given reason to act against the regime or alternatively existing parts of the regime are massively empowered to supplant Putin.

Today even if every Oligarch in Russia colluded to remove Putin forcefully they would probably fail - they would be accused of treason, have all of their property seized and possibly killed. In concert with other parts of Russian society though they aren't powerless and people rebound way too hard off the overstated influence of oligarchs when they conclude that they're totally passive actors.",449803788ceca88c65356cada8235678af11dd93,True,False,,,,,0,1651091000,,0,{},i6g2wlr,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6fv9xk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6g2wlr/,1651091012,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651062200.0,

Russia could overrun the Donbas, get that sham referendum in Kherson going and mint another puppet ""republic"", but at what cost? 

Russia may very well reach the summit of the Mount Everest of its irredentist dreams, only for them to keel over dead 5 seconds later. 

Russia very well may have lost more than **[two-thirds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1516329324567216129?t=6cf59Bp2NVSIDz6s8JzhvA&amp;s=19)** of their deployed tanks in Ukraine *even before the Donbas phase has begun*. [Extrapolating their rate of tank losses](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-42/) sets them up to lose their last active tank by the *summer*. 

(And yes, as many critics of something like /u/ Taw's model have pointed out, war isn't linear, but even *immediately* crashing the intensity of the war to 5 tanks/day (which is extremely unlikely, considering, you know, recent events...) only lasts Russia until August. Even cranking it down to 2 tanks lost per day (an insanely low proposition, even for a ""low simmering"" conflict), they can't even make it to the 1 year anniversary of the invasion.) 

Ukraine isn't just going to sit down and let a low simmering war set in because Russia has nothing left to throw at them. If Russia runs out of tanks, APCs, etc. to throw at Ukraine, Ukraine can and will use such an opportunity to push the Russians' advance from this current offensive back, and some more further back, then out of the Donbas and to the borders of the Russian Federation. 

Putin's fired his super soaker on full blast for as long as he could; anything else, even if it is a lot, will be coming in at a trickle. 

If Putin's so stubborn he refuses to see the writing on the wall and admit defeat, we're going to get to the point where some Volodymyr manning a border post North of Kharkiv is just going to have a daily chore of firing a Javelin or NLAW at the daily 1 tank Russia scrounged up to ""assault"" Kharkiv. 

--- 

Russia has ~10,000 MBTs in ""reserve"" (this figure is probably actually about [6,000](https://youtu.be/eHhgVrKJJoA)) but we all know the vast majority of those are Soviet-era husks rusting away in some long forgotten warehouse in Siberia. And even for whatever tanks are useable, Russia would need to spend time and effort to transport those tanks to the frontlines and reconstitute a new substantive force (consider how many months it took to amass the February 24 invasion force). 

The logistical issues of amassing such an army also applies for any potential mass conscription. Plus, any conscript will need to be trained for months, lest they be incompetent buffoons (even moreso than the current Russian forces we've seen) sent into a meat grinder.

And what good is that if you have no tanks ([Russia's sole tank manufacturer ceased operations thanks to biting sanctions](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/03/russia-stops-tank-production-because-it-cant-get-parts-ukraine-says/)) or IFVs/APCs to ride into battle?

This very very true. The Russian economy is extremely important. That said, from what Putin has said, it seems like he doesn't care about the economy and will ruin it in order to continue the war. At least that's what all the available evidence seems to be pointing toward.

I’d even go a step forward and argue that we’re on the verge of a major shift in tank design, with sensors, processing power, and active defense systems about to receive far more invest and prioritization.  

Future vehicles will be designed from the tracks up to incorporate hundreds of sensors (with current models undergoing yet more modifications) constantly scanning the local environment (both actively pinging and simply watching) for everything from varying magnetic fields or soil composition that might indicate the presence of a mine or IED to scanning the area around the tank for drones or incoming missiles.  Imagine a hundred iPhone cameras scattered around the tank and linked to a system constantly trying to spot known shapes (tanks, humans, weapons) or unusual movement (drones, incoming rounds), audio pickups to locate the position of shooters based on the delay in sound waves hitting different microphones, and a myriad of radar/LiDAR devices to detecting incoming missiles or main gun rounds.  

Imagine the power of a tank platoon or company equipped with these sensors and constantly sharing information back and forth so that AI/ML software can detect threats and highlight them to crew immediately, even generating firing solutions for the weapons that only require a quick trigger pull from the gunner or commander to execute.  The battlefield awareness of vehicles and units will grow with each additional networked vehicle and the ability to accurately and quickly parse data might become more important than the thickness of a tank’s frontal armor.

These systems could also be linked to a variety of defensive gadgets such as lasers, masers, jammers, and solid projectiles to protect a vehicle from incoming threats.  Laser tech is advancing rapidly, and could soon be small enough and powerful enough to provide reasonable protection against incoming missiles, which could once again shift the balance of power.  The computer can react fast enough to identify the threat, get the appropriate countermeasure armed and deployed, and then even start getting the main gun on target and alerting the crew so they can return fire.",05592f23063c904b098a2b109dc91753dfa46651,True,False,,,,,0,1651087840,,0,{},i6fusov,False,t3_ud6pvv,False,True,t1_i6f6i8s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud6pvv/technical_reflections_on_russias_armoured/i6fusov/,1651087853,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651059040.0,

There is no empiric way to measure these things, but the document refers to OSCE standards multiple times.

&gt;Indeed, if you look at the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, quite a few of the countries that joined NATO after 1999 are colored orange, which means their press freedom is ""problematic."" Bulgaria is even colored red, which means their press freedom is ""bad.""

Bulgaria joined in 2004, the same year Radio Free Europe left because they believed they were no longer needed. Bulgaria's  repressive turn has been a more recent development. Joining NATO is different than not getting kicked out of NATO. Here is a good article about Bulgaria and press freedoms: https://www.calvertjournal.com/articles/show/11886/bulgaria-press-media-freedom-decline

Given that, I'm inclined to be very cautious about reports coming out of that region, or news on the subject.

As others have pointed out, there's virtually no way the current Russian forces in the region could represent a serious threat to Ukraine, and in the event of an attempted invasion it is likely that the TDF troops already on guard would be able to repel it. 

Since there's no material threat, I don't see why the Ukrainian government would find the idea of fighting there to be attractive.

I think the russian calculus for the situation goes like this:
- Make a lot of noise and draw eyes to the region

- If it causes Ukraine to redeploy troops away from the region, good.

- If it causes Ukraine to actually send in troops, even better because now we can create a moral equivalence between our action and theirs.

- Failing that, working on a pretext for Russian intervention in Moldova could potentially be useful at a later date, particularly if we manage to take Odessa.

As for the occupation, we're still only two months into this conflict and it's too soon to expect to see an organised and effective resistance. Russia may control a smaller area than they expected and that is easier to control but most of their units are engaged in the fighting and area in no position  to control an insurgency. If/when the locals stay resisting Russia will find it very hard to counter.

As for the Russian economy, the fact that Putin is willing to ignore it is neither here nor there, the economy crumbling will impact on his ability to wage war whether he acknowledges it or not.

As for your solutions, a key thing is that we don't want to totally cripple Russia.

[],False,,SmellTempter,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8kieh6u,False,False,"&gt; For all of Russia's flaws, this is really the first time a modern Army has gone up against a modern insurgency

I get the point you're making and agree for the most part, but I wouldn't characterize the situation in Ukraine as an insurgency (obviously fighting in Donetsk prior was). There has been some plainsclothes operation, and significant mobilization of militias on both sides, but for the most part these strikes are being carried out by uniformed soldiers.

Certainly many of the same tactics are applicable, but a key difference is that in an insurgency you frequently can't tell the fighters from the ordinary people. 

This is just solid infantry tactics with modern equipment. Everyone will absolutely have to adjust to the new reality of small drones though. 

For dealing with them, I could see restrictions on automatic fire control being loosened. Traditionally everyone has been super reluctant to let robots fire automatically, and even anti-missile and CIWS systems are closely supervised and specifically authorized.

Some kind of automated defense turret with good airbust/proximity fuse rounds seems to me a viable solution against drones. Particularly if you also start using image recognition for target identification so you don't run into issues with HARMs or tiny radar cross sections. 

Given the relatively low speed at which drones travel, I bet you such a setup could take them out reasonably well, but because the window between when the drone could practically be seen and when it is in attack range is so short, it would have to be allowed to automatically fire upon targets to work.

This of course doesn't address larger, higher flying drones that would be out of visual range, and yet are still difficult to engage with traditional anti-aircraft weapons. But I do think it would help against smaller drones, and particularly improvised drones that tend to fly slowly and relatively close to the ground.",33743737461a9b5304c2ea1c18ac92bf8157e67e,True,False,,,,,0,1651085497,,0,{},i6fovqc,False,t3_uaw35f,False,True,t1_i61x7lu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uaw35f/the_korea_analogy_is_the_war_in_ukraine_a_war_of/i6fovqc/,1651085511,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651056697.0,

[],False,,SmellTempter,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8kieh6u,False,False,"I think the biggest problem for Taiwan is actually a morale and attitude issue, rather than strictly preparedness, though of course that matters.

I haven't made an academic study of this, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the Taiwanese military and the public in general has a fatalistic attitude towards any eventual invasion. I have also heard corruption and subversion of Taiwanese politicians and military officers is significant, and so in an invasion we'd see much, much greater success in terms of subversive activity or surrenders than we saw in Ukraine.

A good chunk of the world treats their subsumption into China as an inevitability. There has to be a psychological impact for a Taiwanese person using the internet to see how even things like ""select your country"" dropdown menus don't list Taiwan or list it in a PRC-approved fashion like ""Province of China"" or ""Taipei"".

Not to mention all of the times people have grovelled or buckled under backlash for the sin of calling Taiwan a ""country"", as in the John Cena case. Thankfully I think we're seeing more pushback against this, but I'm not surprised the Taiwanese are demoralized if a bunch of people are afraid to call a nation with its own government, currency, and military a country.

I believe that given the geography of the strait, if the Taiwanese were as determined as the Ukrainians it would be a hellish invasion, but I don't believe nationalist sentiment is that strong, and would not be unless it was specifically encouraged or the chinese kicked off the invasion with a massacre of Taiwanese civilians or some other highly enraging event. 

That said, my sense of Beijing has always been that they believe they can eventually suborn or cajole the Taiwanese leadership into a political reunification, and in the absence of some outside factor that changes their calculus, they would much rather threaten an invasion than actually undertake one. I do think the Hong Kong situation has made that less likely however, since mainland offers to let them join as a Special Administrative Region probably seem much, much less attractive now.",8e397ed918ac700c389770662dfc418bfecc65ad,True,False,,,,,0,1651084248,,0,{},i6flqen,False,t3_uaw35f,False,True,t1_i61h12l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uaw35f/the_korea_analogy_is_the_war_in_ukraine_a_war_of/i6flqen/,1651084263,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651055448.0,

""We’ve been buying about 1,000 a year, and we’ve given them around 7,000. Even if you ramp up production, we’re talking about years. We can give them other kinds of anti-tank weapons, but we can’t give them any more Javelins. Stingers are even harder because the production line is not open.”

The US must think about the security of its own soldiers first, that of its allies that it has committed to protect, second, and anything else like Ukraine third. I do think that supplying Ukraine is worth some risk. 

But we must remember that the US allies like Japan and South Korea for example are always watching for any weakness in capability or conviction on the USs part.

It's an example because currently everyone on Reddit believes that Russia is smashed and the Ukrainians will soon be invading Crimea.

Yes, they still need to occupy the country. Saying that just because they can mass detain/arrest and either jail them indefinitely or execute them (which has been tried unsuccessfully numerous times in recent COIN history, to include by the Russians) doesn't mean they don't need to police the areas too. 

How do the security forces know who to arrest? How do security forces find them to arrest them? How do they ensure that security forces can arrest them when they fight back because they know they'll be jailed/killed?

&gt;It seems like they want to turn the Ukrainian population into ""serfs"" again.

And who supervises these serfs if they don't bother occupying them? Do they use the honor system? 

&gt;Russia has changed strategies to a slow grind chipping away at your enemy's powerbase.

No they haven't. The Ukrainian powebase is in western Ukraine that was barely touched. More so it's NATO who are untouchable.

&gt;Well, I think there is a lot of evidence, specifically this war, that Russia (mainly Putin) do not give a shit about Russia's economy.

First, that discounts that the Russian power elite are plutocrats whose wealth comes from having monopolies on sections of the economy (the oligarchs) and Putin's role is to be ""their guy"" who can hold the country together and still remain popular with everyone else..

It also ignores that Putin built a massive ""war chest"" of cash hoping to counter the effects of the lesser sanctions they've been subject to in case of war. And it ignores the draconian steps they've taken to avert immediate disaster (which is why Q3/4 downturns are the new pro-sanction turning point). 

&gt;They have a willing population (Probably 80%+) that will do whatever Putin wants.

No they don't because it hasn't been tested. Suggesting a doctored poll of Russian support for this Special Military Operation and Putin approval ratings coincide with popular support for declaration of war, mobilization, etc is apples and oranges.

&gt;They have enormous resources within their borders.

[],False,,0110-0-10-00-000,,,[],,,,text,t2_7vsfrz63,False,False,"&gt; Outside of Kiev, Russia's military actions have been slow but largely successful. They have gained ground in the south and are occupying Kherson, Melitopol, and are very near to fully controlling Mariupol. These are all battlefield successes. Maybe not the strategic victories Russia was looking for, but strategic victories nonetheless. I suspect these victories will continue of the course of the next couple of months.

I hugely disagree with that characterisation of the war. When the Russians were successful they were quick, as the war has protracted those successes have become more and more sparse (and often been supplanted with failure). Kherson in particular being characterised as a ""battlefield success"" is questionable when there are strong suspicions that the city fell due to local collaboration. As the Russians have tried to advance beyond Kherson they've famously been repulsed multiple times - most famously at Mykolaiv and it's taken them over a full month to not even complete the siege of a totally encircled Mariupol.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Second, Russia has turned to a strategy of pure brutalization. It seems like they want to turn the Ukrainian population into ""serfs"" again. In terms of occupation, you don't need to occupy and control the population if you just send them to jail and perform genocide. Militarily, that strategy can work.

How on earth is convincing everyone to put on shackles easier than convincing them to just carry on their normal lives???? That kind of brutal repression is far more likely to cause insurgency than serfdom. The local populations in the regions Russia has already occupied already had widespread positive sentiment towards Russia (before the war) and spoke Russian natively, it's far more likely that the atrocities we've seen are a product of lacking discipline and coordination rather than a top down directive to turn that goodwill into animosity.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Another aspect is the war has turned to another phase. Russia has changed strategies to a slow grind chipping away at your enemy's powerbase. In this case, the powerbase is the people and the land of Ukraine. If Russia is able to maintain this strategy of attrition over the next couple of years, and NATO kind of ""gives up,"" this strategy could win.

Yes, if Russia is willing to send all of their adult male population to die and NATO decides to stop playing they will ""win"". Have we yet been given any reason to expect this? Have Russia made any sort of attempt to normalise relationships and encourage a renewed dependency on Russian exports? &gt;!Of course they haven't because their leadership are like children who flip over the game board when they lose. Instead of proving that they are reliable suppliers they've shown that they're willing to cut off supplies as a form of coercive diplomacy which sends the clearest possible message to consumers to run away while they have the chance.!&lt;

&gt; Now people will be saying, ""what about Russia's economy? It'll be shit in a few months."" Well, I think there is a lot of evidence, specifically this war, that Russia (mainly Putin) do not give a shit about Russia's economy. They only care about the values of their country (authoritarianism and nationalism seem to be the biggest Russian values) and projecting power. And if they are able to take economic pain to project power to protect their values, they will do it. Russia knew their economy would suffer from this invasion, and have continued with the invasion anyway. And they know their economy will continue to suffer with continued war, and are still continuing the war. In fact, all evidence points to Russia escalating the conflict, which will escalate the economic pain.

Russia is a country made of people and fundamentally the power of the state comes from those people to a greater or lesser extent. The more Putin deprives his countrymen of opportunities the more appealing the option of affixing his head to a pike becomes. I don't see this as likely any time soon but if this war becomes protracted for an extended period of time without victory it will grow into something that the government won't be able to control - whether in the form of the military becoming too powerful or the people themselves protesting to have them removed.",1ad8a42770e8f6f067f32300c083c83a83fa885c,True,False,,,,,0,1651081036,,0,{},i6fdq2j,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t1_i6f8591,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6fdq2j/,1651081053,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651052236.0,

The House is aiming to pass legislation this week that would speed up the transfer of military equipment to Kyiv. Ukrainian lawmakers say it’s urgently needed.

https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/717355/lend-lease-bill-could-turn-the-tide-of-russia-ukraine-war/?unlock=Q20XBWTAZD04LX27

* On April 6, the Senate unanimously passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, a bill modeled after a World War II-era policy that helped U.S. allies defeat Nazi Germany.

* “One of the key problems we have had is the speed at which U.S. aid is delivered to Ukraine,” ... “The new bill would allow aid to be delivered with fewer procedures.

* “We’re at a point now where the military is saying we can’t give them any more Javelins,""

* We’ve been buying about 1,000 a year, and we’ve given them around 7,000. Even if you ramp up production, we’re talking about years. We can give them other kinds of anti-tank weapons, but we can’t give them any more Javelins. Stingers are even harder because the production line is not open.”

* Still, some House lawmakers may request additional amendments, and it’s unclear whether an amended version of the bill would pass the Senate through unanimous consent.

* “When the U.S. military-industrial complex and our manufacturing power backs a country with an endless supply of things like trucks or ammunition, just like it did during World War II, that is a game-changer in a country’s ability to fight off even a bigger force,” said John Spencer, a retired Army major.

My opinion:

It may be true that the US is reaching a point where it is risking its own security by depleting its weapons stockpiles. We cannot ignore or look away from this.

It does however seem to me that it is worth it as a free people are fighting to defend themselves, and there is a priceless opportunity to weaken an aggressive and savage adversary. 

Another post had mentioned that there is a rate of manufacture for the Javelin where it is most cost efficient, something like 3,900 units a year.

That very thing about driving away all of their intellectuals to avoid the risk of having smart people as rivals... One of the twitter dudes who gets quoted here with the super long threads opened my eyes about the gangster state mentality. He talked about avocados and mafia. The whole idea that a mafia trades in violence and thugs will stick to what they understand, like stealing shit to sell to someone else. Any sort of operation that requires technical sophistication that's beyond them means they need to hire nerds and those nerds will eventually represent a rival power bloc that could threaten them -- if the nerds are the ones bringing in the money, why keep the old boss? Not nostalgia. Not loyalty. 

And you look at western democracies that don't have to worry about coups coming from the military and think wouldn't this be a nicer way to live? But when they are so baked into the authoritarian mindset, how do you even change that? If you do try to make a western style military with more power and try to give them a culture of subservience to civilian control, you'll probably just get couped by generals who still go by the old ways. 

It's like when we go into a heavily religious country used to strongmen leaders and tell them hey, we gave you democracy and they'll just vote in a theocracy because that's what they're comfortable with. ""No, you're exercising your freedom of choice incorrectly!"" 

When gaming out alt history scenarios like could the Naze or Imperial Japanese have won WWII... The best path to victory I can think of for them involves changing their whole approach to the point that they would no longer be Nazis or Imperialists and people in their country who were advocating for those ideas were literally murdered for not toeing the party line. Like it would have made more sense for Hitler to not threaten Western Europe and promote himself as a staunch anti-communist because the west hated communism and then the invasion of Russia is an anti-communist move and then be nice to the Ukrainians so they do treat you as liberators and don't go about killing all the Jews because that turns everyone against you... Basically abandon every ideal that makes you Nazis and it literally took burning the country down around them to make them do that.",21d03454c70681b625c796a2e7bbcaff7a8e3022,True,False,,,,,0,1651080425,,0,{},i6fc684,False,t3_ublttg,False,True,t1_i6f9uh8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6fc684/,1651080443,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651051625.0,

Yes Russia has taken 2 medium sized cities (including Mariupol), but they have had to send basically their entire disposable army to do it. They have also suffered heavy attrition during the past two months, with western estimates indicating 20%/25% losses (including wounded). OSint has their tank losses at 10% of total available including tanks that have spent decades parked in a field, and with the tank maintenance factories offline due to lack of parts.

If Russia could keep the current war up for 2 years they probably could wear Ukraine down, and then move on to the next country on their list (probably Moldova) before getting to Poland and the Baltic States, but that is a big if.

Russia probably has a few months to break Ukraine before they run out of steam militarily.

Regarding reducing territorial ambitions, I feel that the idea was always to put km between Moscow and the border, to push the border to a defendable geographic point, so really the half measure is almost worse than useless since taking Dombass plus the south coast just lengthens their border even more. 

Regarding the brutality, I have to agree that you can't have a rebellion if no one's alive to rebel so point there.

Finally you say that they don't care about the economy, but Putin can't be ignorant of the fact that it was the economy that brought down the last 2 major Russian powers. Also difficult to buy parts for tanks without money, but the sanctions are probably making that point moot anyhow.

The M60A3 is maybe useful for night fighting, since it does have a thermal imaging system and gun stabilization. I guess 1000 of those were built in total but I don't know how many the USA still has in storage. Some were sold off. It's still going to be frontally vulnerable to ancient RPG-7V shells, unless it has some major applique armor package installed. The US also has over a thousand un-upgraded M1A1s in storage.

We've not seen a naval fight since WWII and the missile strikes we have seen indicate ships are incredibly vulnerable. If we saw open warfare, I suspect we'd see the seas swept clear of surface ships and navies would be desperately struggling to reassess their strategy. 

Missiles are expensive so spamming isn't quite as easy as you suggest. The question is what is the launch platform and where do you want to kill the carrier? If it's off your coastline then launchers can be cheap, like simple vehicles on the ground, even trailers. But if it's out over the water, you need a plane to carry it, expensive. Look at what it would cost to equip a soviet-style bomber regiment. Or you need ships or subs which are also expensive. 

Locating ships at sea is tough and satellites can only do you so much good. But ships far out at sea have no influence on the land so they have to get close to be of use which then puts them into range of land-based missiles. 

Look it up and you'll see boatloads of studies on all of this. I think carriers are useless fighting ship to ship at this point, too vulnerable, but we've typically used them as enforcement tools against the third world bombing poor people and they're great for that. :/ 

The thing you see with history is if there's a lot of inertia behind doing things a certain way, it's going to remain so until the old way is blown to bits in battle.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"I think a dangerous thing could be happening. People outside Ukraine could be underestimating Russia and their resolve. 

After the humiliating defeat for the battle of Kiev, Russia's image is seriously impacted. They performed a terrible operation under terrible intelligence and terrible assumptions. That lead to the ultimate demise of the units trying to take Kiev.

Outside of Kiev, Russia's military actions have been slow but largely successful. They have gained ground in the south and are occupying Kherson, Melitopol, and are very near to fully controlling Mariupol. These are all battlefield successes. Maybe not the strategic victories Russia was looking for, but strategic victories nonetheless. I suspect these victories will continue of the course of the next couple of months. 

Going into the war, the assumption was that Russia could not win the occupation after the war. This assumption has turned out to probably be false. Russia has turned to two strategies that make the occupation possible. First, they aren't controlling all of the territory of Ukraine. Instead, they are controlling small pieces of the territory which makes the numbers work better for them. Second, Russia has turned to a strategy of pure brutalization. It seems like they want to turn the Ukrainian population into ""serfs"" again. In terms of occupation, you don't need to occupy and control the population if you just send them to jail and perform genocide. Militarily, that strategy can work. 

Another aspect is the war has turned to another phase. Russia has changed strategies to a slow grind chipping away at your enemy's powerbase. In this case, the powerbase is the people and the land of Ukraine. If Russia is able to maintain this strategy of attrition over the next couple of years, and NATO kind of ""gives up,"" this strategy could win. 

Now people will be saying, ""what about Russia's economy? It'll be shit in a few months."" Well, I think there is a lot of evidence, specifically this war, that Russia (mainly Putin) do not give a shit about Russia's economy. They only care about the values of their country (authoritarianism and nationalism seem to be the biggest Russian values) and projecting power. And if they are able to take economic pain to project power to protect their values, they will do it. Russia knew their economy would suffer from this invasion, and have continued with the invasion anyway. And they know their economy will continue to suffer with continued war, and are still continuing the war. In fact, all evidence points to Russia escalating the conflict, which will escalate the economic pain. 

Given all of that, I think the assumption needs to be made that Russia will try to project power in any way possible. Additionally, outside leverage won't matter except for one thing, impacting Russia's military/police state capability. If outside leverage can impact Russia's military/police state capability, it'll be effective. If it does not have an impact, Russia/Putin will shrug it off. 

Impacting Russia's Military/police state capability is very very difficult. They have a willing population (Probably 80%+) that will do whatever Putin wants. They have enormous resources within their borders. They have a fairly large population (145 million people). They have nuclear weapons. And they have a strong propaganda network that is hard to break through. 

To me, the way to impact Russia is to focus on their Military/Police state. There are many many ways that this can be achieved by NATO without a direct confrontation. To me, here are the effective ways to impact Russia's military/police states.

* Continue to heavily support Ukraine - slowly more effective weapons/training. That'll have a direct impact on Russia's military capability. Especially as more sophisticated NATO weapons show up like predators or precision guided artillery/rockets. 
* Continue the propaganda war in Russia using cyber warfare 
* Attack Russia's infrastructure any way possible. Sanctions, cyber warfare, covert sabotage, export pipeline sabotage, economic warfare, through Ukraine, etc.
* Encourage rebellion in Russia's satellite states. This will tie up Russia's military/police state equipment in the satellite states. Georgia and Chechnya are two examples.
* Increase the heat of the conflict in Syria. Put Assad under pressure so he goes begging to Russia for more support. 
* Harass Russia's borders from all locations. One way to do this is to fly aircraft near Russia's borders and force them to scramble jets. This will pin down Russian forces all across Russia and deny them the ability to go to Ukraine. Additionally, build up forces on Russia's borders, so they are forced to deploy forces on their border to defend against attack. 
* Harass Russia's submarine fleets. Follow them, ping them using helicopters, let them know that their submarines are not safe at sea. 
* Increase NATO capability. The biggest thing here is to increase anti-ballistic missile capability. Patriot missiles for short range, THAAD for medium, and GMD long range ICBMs. 
* Increase oil/gas/renewable/nuclear supplies to Europe to decrease the dependence on Russian fossil fuels. 
* Take a heavy hand on Russia's ability to project power internationally. Specifically in counterintelligence and counter propaganda efforts. 

All of that is a hard line to take with Russia. It also puts a lot of populations (Syria, Ukraine, etc) in the crossfire. Quite frankly, I don't think there is an option with Russia. They have already shown they are taking a hard line. Unless Russia is willing to come to the negotiating table and negotiate in good faith, the hard line is kind of the only option.",ce29d83d03e93527e85c196a7fac9f974a118558,True,False,,,,,0,1651078850,,0,{},i6f8591,False,t3_ud1voz,False,True,t3_ud1voz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud1voz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_27_2022/i6f8591/,1651078865,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651050050.0,

Failures to do those things will lead to a failure of the mission.

Here's a discussion on [the difference between amorality and immorality](https://calstuart.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/amorality-vs-immorality-whats-the-best-way-to-understand-a-sociopath/). TL;DR: amorality is associated with sociopathy (""sociopath"" = those who have no regard for others’ rights or feelings, lack empathy and remorse for wrongdoings, and have the need to exploit and manipulate others for personal gain). One does not aspire to have a sociopathic neighbor since possible benefits (e.g. one might collectively agree to ignore zoning restrictions on short-term rentals) are outweighed by more significant costs (e.g. one's amoral neighbor might rape and murder you or your children if they think they can get away with it).

While America has a long history of amoral/immoral actions (e.g. genocide of Native Americans, slavery, Latin American imperialism, etc.), it's evolved over the centuries to play a more benign role on the world stage. China, as a people and culture, has existed for much longer than America and is approaching becoming the largest world economy. As such, it could be expected to play a more benign role on the world stage, but instead maintains expansionist or colonialistic tendencies (and continues to repress potential internal opposition groups).",9e44ee1d703f21d274f0757ee3693a966d678135,True,False,,,,,0,1651077891,,0,{},i6f5nts,False,t3_u8cu2e,False,True,t1_i5uly9m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8cu2e/solomon_islandschina_deal_australias_leaders/i6f5nts/,1651077906,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651049091.0,

They very well might ""retaliate"" against Ukraine. If they do, Ukraine would be well within their rights to attack them. Again, I have no doubt Moldova would give such an operation their blessing. 

And yes, while there are about 1,500 Russian troops there there's also another ~10,000 Transnistrian troops who could get involved in the fighting. The whole thing is preposterous as they would get crushed (they have horrible equipment and no means for resupply), and yet that's the direction things seem to be moving in.

Relying on western support, Ukrainians already destroyed about 1/3 of Russian forces in Ukraine, they've done a level of damage to them that will take years to recover from. At this point, right now, NATO doesn't really need to worry about Russian ground force threat until probably 2027, because it's going to take half a decade to fix what's happened to it. Their entire New Look reform investment is gone. And that's just talking about destroyed, not damaged material and manpower, like the tens of thousands of PTSD cases minimum that Russia is going to deal with, the recruiting shortfalls, the shortages in company grade officers they can't replace, the destruction of their newly created NCO corps, etc.

When we're talking about NATO we're really talking about national leaders from partner countries. Germany is rightly freaking out because they are utterly reliant on Russian energy and it'll take years to undo that, they've been dragging their feet enough that many joke that the current chancellor is a Russian sleeper agent or is being blackmailed by them.

Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a great political talking point and I'm not the only one who will know this. Are you sure there is popular support amongst the voting population in the US or other countries to suffer economically in order to keep the war going, keep sanctions going, keep funding, equipping, and pressuring Zelenskyy to fight, all in a bid to kill more Russians versus returning to the situation as it existed before the war?

It seems that the Russian equipment is rarely to blame for their failures in Ukraine. Instead it is the training and command of the soldiers who operate the equipment that have lead to such a disaster. This is especially damning as this was a war of choice where the Russian leadership knew they were going to invade, and still failed to adequately train their soldiers and leaders.

Quotes:

&gt; * Some of the very first images to emerge from the war in Ukraine... were of burning Russian armoured vehicles... to include some of the more advanced tanks in Russia’s arsenal: the T-80BVM and T-72B3M. Images.. may appear shocking. ...However, if we consider the design of Russian main battle tanks – and this also applies to the Ukrainian, Polish, Chinese, Indian and many other tank fleets – these images are both less shocking, and less useful in analysing Russian armour.

&gt; * All of this means that Russian tanks are quite well protected from the front. For the massed head-on engagements that they were designed for, and especially in defensive positions where the tanks can be dug into the ground, they are capable and effective vehicles, providing that they are properly operated. Even when operated poorly, Soviet T-72s gained a good reputation during the Iran–Iraq War, and the design was an export success.

&gt; * Russian tank designs can fire on the move to a limited extent, but there is less evidence to suggest that they are as capable as Western designs.

&gt; * For the massed head-on engagements that they were designed for, and especially in defensive positions, Russian tanks are capable and effective vehicles – providing that they are properly operated

&gt; * Simple tasks for tank crews such as replacing and repairing tracks, refuelling, and situational awareness are likely more difficult with three personnel rather than four.

&gt; * The use of the carousel enabled Soviet designers to reduce the height of their tanks, as well as the crew complement from the four personnel pursued in most other designs to three. The reasons for this are objectively sound. The smaller volume of the tank reduces the area that must be armoured, in turn reducing the weight. The lower height presents a smaller target for enemy tanks, and the automatic loader enables the tank to fire when moving across country at almost any speed, although accuracy will suffer. A few other design decisions were made at the same time. Most of the armour of Soviet-era tanks is located at the front of the vehicle, protecting the turret and the glacis of the hull. Most tanks lack protection to the sides of the hull and the turret – Soviet designs more so than their Western counterparts.

&gt;  * ...however, it is not possible to add sufficient passive armour to the sides of a tank to stop a Panzerfaust-3 anti-tank weapon with a penetration of around 800 mm of RHA protected by ERA.

&gt; * So, the catastrophic losses of Russian and Ukrainian tanks are the result of several issues: the location of the tank’s ammunition, which makes it hard to protect from the sides; its lack of separation from the crew; and the ease with which most tanks can be penetrated from the side.

&gt; * ...Russian and Soviet tanks are not inherently flawed, the autoloader was a conscious decision made to improve mobility and provide enough protection for its original role. They have certain weaknesses in modern warfare, but all designs will have some weakness, be that weight, cost, firepower, or limited protection. In sum, the perfect tank doesn’t exist.

&gt; * ...need to consider of Russian tactics and doctrine, which typically emphasise combined arms operations... This means that armoured formations operating independently from their supporting arms are probably doing something that they are not trained to do. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this factor, and failure to take it into account has previously led analysts to incorrectly write off Russian-made armour.

&gt; * ...subsequent simulations of the Battle of 73 Easting run using the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory’s JANUS system showed that when the Iraqi crews were modelled as using effective combined arms tactics including reconnaissance and infantry support, they inflicted 50 vehicle losses – over 70% of the 2nd Armoured Cavalry Regiment’s strength at the battle – despite losing overall. This was despite the model incorporating the M1 Abrams’ advantages in areas such as range and thermal sights, as well as the effects of US air supremacy.",4a666a78c2b1627ee1650439c78793aef487e9ae,True,False,,,,,0,1651075688,,0,{},i6ezyen,True,t3_ud6pvv,False,True,t3_ud6pvv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud6pvv/technical_reflections_on_russias_armoured/i6ezyen/,1651075704,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651046888.0,

Quotes from the Article: 

&gt; * The bin Laden who emerges from these pages surprises. After 9/11, “global jihad was on autopilot,” Lahoud tells us, and in her estimation al-Qaeda was experiencing “operational impotence.”

&gt; * She disputes al-Qaeda’s long-standing reputation as “a Leviathan in the jihadi landscape,” an image she acknowledges lasted until bin Laden’s death. Instead, she shows us a man in defeat, essentially imprisoned in his hideout in Pakistan

&gt; * “Everything in the bin Laden papers,” Lahoud writes, “indicates that al-Qaeda could not have been behind the [London July 2005]  attacks.” 

&gt; * Similarly for the Madrid bombing in 2004 and the disrupted 2006 plot to use liquid explosives on transatlantic flights. 

&gt; * Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was not the mastermind of those attacks.  ...credits another man — Egyptian pilot Gameel al-Batouti — with providing the inspiration for the attacks, albeit posthumously and unintentionally. (Federal officials blamed Batouti for crashing his plane into the Atlantic near Nantucket in 1999, killing 217.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EgyptAir_Flight_990

&gt; * And she weighs in on debates over the impetus for the 2004 formal merger between al-Qaeda and Zarqawi’s AQI, the predecessor to the Islamic State, seeing it as a way of helping bin Laden reassert his group’s relevance despite his being in hiding.

&gt; * Ultimately, “global jihad itself, [bin Laden] came to realize, had been ill-conceived,”

&gt; * If bin Laden’s “post-9/11 goals did not go beyond empty threats, unexecuted plans, and more than a little wishful thinking,” then how are we to understand the persistent, ever-expanding U.S. policy focused on al-Qaeda and its supposed existential threat?

&gt; * Lahoud contends that the misassessments “diverted valuable resources away from other more threatening jihadi groups,” allowing “the Islamic State to eclipse al-Qaeda.",64ea329a3a01a24e2e55157f4da72187d9fd377f,True,False,,,,,0,1651068990,,0,{},i6eizef,True,t3_ud4an5,False,True,t3_ud4an5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud4an5/an_eyeopening_portrait_of_bin_laden_drawn_from/i6eizef/,1651069009,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651040190.0,

In that sense it was a date which might guide Putin and cause him to pressure his generals in ways that would cause mistakes but it wasn't a red line. It's entirely possible that with the date approaching he'll simply emphasise the victory in Mariupol and how the Russians are definitely close to a final victory which is 100% coming any day now.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't see them committing to full mobilisation on that date though:

1. They seemingly have no intention to protract the conflict and it would take months for that mobilisation to even have an effect.
2. While there is definitely support for a special military operation, that doesn't necessarily translate into domestic support for a war and especially not the sort of war which requires mobilisation for victory.
3. Mobilisation doesn't necessarily solve the problems that Russia has in this conflict right now although they might end up needing more bodies if the conflict continues.

&gt; A spike in oil prices inevitably leads to an increase in production. And increasing production is usually cheap because oil producers recognize that the cheapest place to store oil is in the ground, so they just stop pumping as much when they don't like the current price point. It doesn't take years to increase capacity, it takes months to weeks at most. And you'd better believe US shale producers will start pumping gas at current prices, and doubly so if the Russians cut supplies to Europe.

This isn't anywhere near the truth. If you stop pumping a well, you will lower the lifespan of the well and the equipment, causing the new fractures in the rock for the oil to go lowering overall pressure. In many cases, they cap them off, permanently reducing extractable amounts. An individual oil well is like a pinprick which can get out so much pressure worth of oil (by putting energy and equipment into it). If you stop, you lose the pressure. You can make a new prick or put in more energy than before, but it's a net loss. Not doing anything is also quite costly.

My old posts from the past year are primarily about the petrochemical industry and a huge capacity bottleneck due to fallen investment in the past decade. There were estimates last year that Russia would need 100 billion of investments to maintain current production - that's obviously not coming now. Most of the rest of the world is also capacity strained. American shale producers can't even get enough sand or steel pipe right now.

Oryx has 495 tanks destroyed for which we know the type (and 76 ""Unknown Russian tank""; plus obviously all tanks destroyed for which we don't have pics). Only 18/495 (4%) are T90s.

They need those weapons if the war escalates.

Currently, they cannot replace or replenish those, as they rely on western supply lines.

Like the invasion itself, this was a political decision by Putin and the FSB.

That power bloc has been assassinating or jailing anyone who threatens their political power, including people who are friendly to them, in order to guarantee that they and they alone control all political and economic power bases in Russia.

So the sort of entrepreneurs and tech geniuses that Russia creates all end up fleeing.

Nikolai and Pavel Durov, for example, responded to the government takeover of the social media platform they invented, VK, by leaving Russia and inventing Telegram.

Pavel specifically is a mathematician of immense ability who could have either helped with PGM development or trained someone else who could be. But as Russian society started to lock down in recent years, he and his brother left the country. 

Russia is not a society that is capable of producing technologically advanced weapons, because everyone capable of doing that scientific work ends up fleeing government repression. 

And the Russian government, the FSB bloc that runs it anyway, wants that. Because smart people who aren't them are a threat to their power.

So they'd rather Russia be poorer and weaker with them running it than stronger and far more advanced as a sovereign democracy looking towards its Novgorodian heritage.

Which is why people have wondered if Putin was a CIA agent, because he and his pals have done nothing but hurt Russia for their own benefit since they got in power.",dea8f1b6465ac47b053ee8e3f0ff71ef6470172a,True,False,,,,,0,1651057557,,0,{},i6dwkrf,False,t3_ublttg,False,True,t1_i6cnpgj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6dwkrf/,1651057575,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651028757.0,

Moscow’s move to recognize the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk was based on the Kosovo precedent, set up by  a UN-backed court, Putin told Guterres. The republics emerged after people living in Ukraine’s east rejected the Western-backed 2014 Maidan, he explained.

Putin added that the post-coup Kiev government opted for a military solution that led to the eight-year standoff in the Donbass.

“I remember very well the decision of the International Court of Justice, which states that in exercising the right to self-determination, a territory of any state is not obliged to apply for permission to declare its sovereignty to the central authorities of the country,” Putin said
“So many states in the world, including our opponents in the West, have done this with respect to Kosovo. Kosovo is recognized by a lot of states – it is a fact – by a lot of Western states it is recognized as an independent state. We did the same with respect to the republics of the Donbass,” Putin said, adding that the republics subsequently asked Moscow for military assistance – which Russia provided in full compliance with the UN Charter.",a102f9bae8999fe56b8808080be56a4f13e97c57,True,False,,,,,0,1651056792,,0,{},i6dvgqe,False,t3_u07pv0,False,True,t3_u07pv0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u07pv0/the_army_the_government_and_the_people_in_the/i6dvgqe/,1651056803,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651027992.0,

Or the X-47 series, which again are just demonstrators. 

The US would likely have zero interest in deploying a high tech stealth drone where there is a chance it couldn't be recovered.

&gt;Crucially, this forecast assumes that the conflict
remains confined to Ukraine, further sanctions on Russia exempt the energy sector (although the impact
of European countries’ decisions to wean themselves
off Russian energy and embargoes announced through
March 31, 2022, are factored into the baseline),
and the pandemic’s health and economic impacts
abate over the course of 2022. [...]

&gt; Unusually high uncertainty surrounds this forecast, and downside
risks to the global outlook dominate—including from
a possible worsening of the war, escalation of sanc-
tions on Russia, a sharper-than-anticipated decelera-
tion in China as a strict zero-COVID strategy is
tested by Omicron, and a renewed flare-up of the
pandemic should a new, more virulent virus strain
emerge. Moreover, the war in Ukraine has increased
the probability of wider social tensions because of
higher food and energy prices, which would further
weigh on the outlook.

Basically the IMF has no fucking clue what's going to happen, and they admit it.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"There are some interesting facts in the article but the analysis is incredibly myopic. For two months, we've watched the Russian military fail to perform on every imaginable level: strategic, operational, tactical, logistical. The authors do not seem to notice at all that the underlying causes of those failures have not been addressed. 

A broken system produced this invasion, and it remains broken, and in fact is significantly degraded from its questionable starting point. The loss of many of Russia's most capable and experienced combat personnel, the extremely poor condition of all but the most elite formations' equipment, the effective destruction of many of those elite formations themselves, their inability to conduct even the simplest of combined arms operations, their nearly useless air force, the widespread inability to supply basic supplies such as food and ammunition, the complete failure to secure any information advantage on the battlefield via ISR assets, the inability to secure communications, incredibly poor opsec which can only get worse with the loss of substantial percentages of their elite formations... the list goes on and on. This doesn't all just go away because Putin decided to mobilize the population ideologically, and failing to consider any of these factors is frankly idiotic. 

The article spends an inordinate amount of time evaluating the possibility of Russia retaining access to foreign supplied components, without once recognizing that even under optimal, pre-2014 conditions, production of Iskander and similar quality PGMs was extremely low. On the order of a few hundred per year at most. Which is about 10 days worth at their current expenditure rate. 

As for the economic analysis... well that also leaves quite a lot to be desired. A spike in oil prices inevitably leads to an increase in production. And increasing production is usually cheap because oil producers recognize that the cheapest place to store oil is in the ground, so they just stop pumping as much when they don't like the current price point. It doesn't take years to increase capacity, it takes months to weeks at most. And you'd better believe US shale producers will start pumping gas at current prices, and doubly so if the Russians cut supplies to Europe.

And while the Russians may have a ton of foreign currency flowing in from gas sales, that does not mean they can substitute those funds for a functioning economy. Sanctions also limit what they can import, and what they can buy with those imports. 

And its analysis of internal dissent completely fails to acknowledge the complexity of Russian society. While many people will happily remain trapped in the propaganda bubble, many of the most elite and important members of society will retain contacts with the west. They might not speak up or act on the information they receive, but they will know that their standard of living has been demolished and they will know why. The USSR enjoyed a far greater level of control over the information environment than the Russian Federation could ever hope to, and yet it collapsed under economic pressures of a far lesser magnitude than the current sanctions regime, and with an economy far better structured for isolationist self-supply. 

And while the authors are right that NATO and its allies need to pay more attention to the information war among peripheral nations, they do not even recognize the obvious conclusion one can draw from the ""de-ukrainization"" rhetoric they quote: the Russian government can only drum up support for the war by calling for genocide. China might accept that, but it will be a hard sell anywhere else. So Russia is trapped between motivating their own people and alienating the non-NATO semi-allies it may depend upon for some form of economic and technological reinforcement over the coming months. And even if China accepts such rhetoric, I suspect they are not willing to pay for the Russians' mistakes.

Ultimately, mobilizing the Russian people won't win the war. They need training, equipment, ammunition, experienced combat leaders, advanced weaponry, and a million other things that the Russian military was not able to produce in peacetime, in the absence of sanctions.",002e8adc597279aad5779b1f310529fde99bcb4c,True,False,,,,,0,1651025001,,0,{},i6cjwvc,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6caik4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6cjwvc/,1651025014,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650996201.0,

&gt;Data analyzed by Bellingcat supports the hypothesis that the 2014 explosions in Czechia were part of a longer-term GRU operation aimed at disrupting Ukraine’s capabilities to procure weapons and munitions critical to its defense against Russian troops and Russia-sponsored militants in the war in Eastern Ukraine. The operation appears to have been initiated shortly after July 2014 when Russian authorities subordinated the disparate Russia-supported militant groups in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine under central control and military supervision of the GRU. The mission, which appears to have been run by the subversion and sabotage sub-unit of GRU’s Unit 29155, included several contiguous operations among which were the explosions at the Vrbetice depots, the assassination attempt on Emilian Gebrev, and – with increasing likelihood – at least one of the three explosions at munition depots in Bulgaria in early to mid-2015.

[...]

&gt;according to two sources that in 2014 and 2015 were close to Ukraine military procurement who requested anonymity to comment on a confidential matter, it played a crucial role in boosting Ukraine’s defense capability at a time when its territorial integrity was at stake. Crucially, according to these sources EMCO was one of only two EU companies that specialized in manufacturing state-of-the-art munitions compatible with Soviet-era weapons, especially in the large-bore (120 mm to 152 mm) range. According to one of the sources, in 2014 there were only two manufacturing plants that produced compatible munitions, and “the other company was under effective Russian control”, leaving EMCO as the only possible foreign-based provider of munitions for Ukraine’s army.

&gt;One of the sources also described a practice by Russian military intelligence which consisted of approaching arms traders who had ammunition compatible with Ukraine’s artillery, and offering them “significantly above market prices” to purchase their stock, in order to prevent Ukraine’s access to the market. The source also described three shiploads of munition manufactured or upgraded by EMCO that had been successfully imported into Ukraine, although the source did not specify if EMCO itself sold to Ukraine or if the ammunition came via a third party.

Outside of two attempts on Gebrev, the Bulgarian arms dealer, there was also an attempt by the same GRU unit on EMCO's production director.",d7887792fea9ca5fce93cbeb557166fde43cd4b0,True,False,,,,,0,1651020194,,0,{},i6c8rw7,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6bxtad,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6c8rw7/,1651020207,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650991394.0,
