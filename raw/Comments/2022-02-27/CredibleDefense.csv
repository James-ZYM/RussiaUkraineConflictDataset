What is raising red flags for me:  
\-claims of super slow advance and stagnation - russkies are just cautious, and need time to build supply lines, move heavy artillery  
\-claims that ""putin has only X days to accomplish objectives"" - no, there's no reason to think that  
\-claims that russkies are disoriented and they don't know where they are going - obviously a soldier would NOT tell you  
\-claims that a certain city is ""back under UA control"" , multiple times since start of hostilities  
\-random videos of RU troops walking though cities without much fear, not seeking cover  
\-claims of severe fuel shortages and desertions could be just vehicles abandoned due to mechanical failure (expected to be seen in any theater)  
\-UA claims of losses inflicted to enemy grossly inflated , especially in the air(someone in the thread mentioned the exact same thing was happening in Serbia during NATO bombings)

Generally, initial dimness has turned into optimism in the last days. There's a chance we'll be in a for a rude awakening when the smoke clears.

IMHO there are pretty big odds UA is suffering from:  
\-command and control failure, lack of battlespace awareness  
\-units not engaging the enemy due to fear, lack of confidence / training / motivation  
\-only small RU units (scouts) are engaged, UA lacks firepower to engage armor and logistics convoys.   
\-man-mounted AA and anti-tank were not distributed properly, or troops are not well trained to use them. Also UA lacks mobility and tactical prowess to engage large formations of tanks or choppers.  
\-RU is moving pretty much as they please, and intentionally avoid entering large cities for now.  
\-leadership is somewhat desperate, and hopes to dissuade the enemy through urban warfare. The few well trained troops are set up defensively around symbolic locations (parliament, presidential palace)

And they have already shown they can do that. The Russian tank columns are not doing anything useful. And the Ukrainians will only get stronger as more arms flow in from the West, and more people sign up for the army.

&gt;And if they do Russia will start using ever more indiscriminate weapons.

Like I said, I just don’t think Putin can afford having those pictures come back to the Russian public. They might support a “precision strike”, but not carpet bombing of major cities.

And even if Putin decides to go that route, it doesn’t automatically win him the war. People will still be fighting among the rubble. Just look at how long it took for the Syrian army to retake Aleppo, despite years of indiscriminate bombing.

&gt;Sanctions sometimes work... in the long term.

These sanctions could work a lot faster than we are used to seeing. Thus far, sanctions has usually meant trade sanctions, which work very slowly, if at all.

In broad strokes, your extrapolation of casualty figures to 1 million based upon napkin math from the battle of Okinawa is wildly amateurish and is not in any sense a serious analysis of the military situation. Using the battle of Okinawa is wildly inappropriate because the situations are in no sense comparable besides both involving military forces vaguely. You’re grasping at straws to compare two different wars separated by being on different sides of the globe 80 years apart. If you want the last reply, feel free, but I don’t see any benefit from talking in circles about this. 

Any argument that starts with x happened at Okinawa and based purely on that (simply substituting population counts and assuming similar ratios will hold), concludes Russia will lose its 2022 war in ukraine is wrongheaded.

I'm definitely worried that the traditional forces will prevail. The Russians are still gaining ground and they still have more to throw into the fight.

Here is my point of view. I think the Russians were hoping and planning for an Iraq 2003 or an Afghanistan 2001 invasion. Where the local forces basically dissolve after a few days of fighting. That's a possibility that could happen. What that takes is convincing the fighting forces (aka Ukrainians) that surrender is a better option than fighting. 

With the information I have, and my understanding of Ukrainian history, it seems like the vast majority of the fighting forces and the civilian population will take death over living under Russian rule. I take this evidence based upon Ukraine history, the interviews with Ukrainian civilians, and the use of Molotov cocktails already against Russian columns. Using a molotov against a tank is insanely dangerous, yet you see it happening. 

What that tells me is that this invasion is less like Iraq 2003 and more like the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. The US had overwhelming air and mechanized support. The Japanese had mostly small arms with a few mortars and that was about it. The US invaded with around 250k combat troops and the Japanese had about 100k soldiers split between 70k combat troops and 40k civilian conscripts. Give or take. All of the Japanese fighters died at the cost of about 30k US soldiers, so a kill ratio of 3-1. That happened over the course of about 3 months. That's with a pre-war population in Okinawa of about 500k people. 

You can argue that the weapons that Russia has is more sophisticated than what the US had in 1945. And I'd argue that the small arms that Ukrainians have are more sophisticated than what the Japanese in Okinawa had. I'd argue that these two differences probably cancel each other out and maybe favor Ukrainians as they have access to sophisticated anti-mechanization weapons. And the support of the international community. 

With Ukraine, there are 40 million people. If they get the same amount of conscripts, they are looking at 4 million conscripts (10%). And if they get a kill ratio of the Japanese, they are looking at kill roughly 1 million Russians. Can they sustain that many loses? I mean, the Russian military is roughly 1 million people with 2 million reserves. So they'd have to drain basically all of their forces and reserves to win. And then they'd need conscripts to make up the difference.

The question is this, can Russia's political system sustain such a war? I think the answer is an absolutely fucking not. The political system in Russia depends upon fear, in that Russians don't talk bad about the state because they could die. If you change that system where Russians are forced to fight in a war that they don't want to fight in, now the question becomes ""do I die killing Ukrainians or in Russia to stop this war?"" I think a lot of Russians are going to chose the second options.

There is also the technical problems of sustaining such a war of a million people dying. Russia simply does not have the mechanized equipment for a million soldiers. They will run out of tanks, and helicopters. So the second half of that million soldiers will be just that, soldiers. Guns and personal armor. Will they be able to sustain a 4-1 kill ratio? I highly doubt it. 

So looking at it from a military perspective, I think Russia lost and it's only a matter of time. The end of the war looks like two things: 1. The Russian forces are pushed back to Russia/Belarus with a peace treaty with Russia losing or 2. The Russian forces disband due to internal conflict in Russia. The best option for Putin right now is to pull out, abandon Eastern Ukraine, hold Crimea, and use internal Russian propaganda to try and spin this as a Russian victory. And he needs to do that very very soon otherwise he'll probably be removed from power.",88cd7441086c726296e913e4ee4bc8290d65c3d6,True,False,,,,,0,1645997168,,0,{},hyp130m,False,t3_t1w6lp,False,True,t1_hymksau,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1w6lp/ukraine_megathread_february_26/hyp130m/,1645997179,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645968368.0,

I'd make an analogy to the early history of physics. In its earliest days, it was regarded as ""Natural Philosophy."" Folks such as Aristotle attempted a systematic explanation of cause and effect in the world, but based it on the method of philosophizing. Essentially Aristotle just imagined what sort of system sounded sensible to him, and so long as it was logically consistent in the sense the ancient Greeks understood it, then clearly it was true. This lead Aristotle to explanations that were ""tidy"" in a sort of metaphysical/poetic sense, but that ultimately were both limited and inaccurate in describing the natural world. It wasn't until Galileo and his contemporaries, nearly a millennia later, that the idea of the scientific method, that is creating a mathematical model that makes specific quantifiable predictions that can can be compared with empirical observation emerges. That was Galileo's big contribution: that algebra (nee math as a whole) would be the language of science, and that empiricism is what separates physics from metaphysical philosophizing.

In many ways, Economics hasn't quite had that watershed moment, placing it on firm empirical foundations. Attempts to find a formal system of natural laws underlying macro-economics have largely failed. Major institutions use Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models even though we know the assumptions underlying these models are mostly false, because as flawed as they are they're among the better tools we've come up with. In practice most economic modeling, eg what quants at hedge funds do, boils down to practical approximations (if not explicitly just a Bayesian modeling).

The Austrian school, or at least the most aggressive of its proponents, reject the value of empiricism wholesale, instead believing that economics can be derived by reason (prax) alone. This is a claim that wasn't particularly well received at the time, and hasn't gotten better with age. We know the micro economic assumptions the Austrians used are straight up false (this is what 

The Lucas critique remains relevant. If you're unfamiliar and you'll let me be a bit hand wavy, the Lucas critique essentially says that economics is a game played between actors that have some ability to change the rules. As a result the structure of the economy can't be seen as something that's invariant independent of policy. The strongest form of this critique could be interpreted as saying the entire project of finding invariant natural laws that underly macro economics is doomed. That's not a death sentence for economics, however it would mean the future of economic modeling will look more like biology than physics, that is we'll have computational models that can make increasingly better predictions of complex economic systems, but won't find anything like the invariant symmetries that underly modern physics.",a96731da93ee1eb219dc0084503b74c1d3026986,True,False,,,,,0,1645997026,,0,{},hyp0qe5,False,t3_t2eyf2,False,True,t1_hyon54q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2eyf2/the_entire_ukraine_conflict_reminds_me_that_im/hyp0qe5/,1645997041,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645968226.0,

How you knows how much operative is the Ukraine Air Force?

Literally we knows that one of the first thing that Russia did was attack Airfields and Military bases thats why you has not heard about Ukraine combat aircraft engaging Dogfight or bombing/attacking Russian positions. 

How i do this last claim?, well noticing the massive Ukrainian propaganda amplified by Western media, if Ukraine Air Force was operative we would be hearing way more about them instead just an Hoax (Ghost of Kyiv). Mostly news/footage we got are from quite small Anti-Air system trying to engage Russian aircrafts (sometimes failing and sometimes being successful).

[],False,,cretan_bull,,,[],,,,text,t2_93kjo,False,False,"Kiev is definitely not encircled. So far, the only major forces that have reached the city (excluding Spetsnaz, VDV, and various attempts at infiltration) have come from the north-west, penetrating as far as Bucha and Irpin. 

Russia still hasn't taken Chernihiv. That city sits right on top of the entire road network from Belarus to the eastern flank of Kiev. It was undoubtedly the day-1 target for a sizable number of the BTGs in Belarus. That battle has been ongoing since right after the war began, and there are as yet no signs it is even close to falling.

They might be able to move some forces around its perimeter to the road network in the rear, but it's logistics that's the problem, and if Russia tries to do the same thing with logistics convoys (if they even can), then they'll be ambushed by Chernihiv's defenders.

So, the only forces that can attack Kiev from the East are those out of Kurk and Bryansk. Sumy is still standing, somehow, but that's not on the main route of advance to Kiev. Russian forces have been observed as deep as Obychiv, and I wouldn't be surprised if some had reached Kipti. But, again, logistics is the problem. Bypassing points of resistance works right up until said resistance ambushes your logistics convoys, which we've seen plenty of examples of happening.

And even if Russia were able to move up a sizable number of BTGs to the east and west flanks of Kiev, and keep them supplied, that's irrelevant for keeping the city supplied. The city has a road network to the south, and a very well protected subway network that goes as far as Vasylkiv. The VDV failed to take Vasylkiv. There were also reports they tried to attack Bila Tserkva, but that's less well substantiated. It's possible some BTGs could try to edge around from the western edge of the city to the south and cut it off, but there are no signs of that happening yet and it would take a very sizable force to succeed. And all indications are that Russia doesn't have the forces to make that happen. I'm sure those BTGs exist, they're just stuck somewhere on the road between the city and Chernobyl. Russia just launched another attack on the city, in no more than battalion strength and with only light vehicles. They wouldn't have done that if they had a dozen BTGs in good supply near Hostomel.

So, for the time being at least, Kiev is in no danger of being cut off. From Bila Tserkva it's a clear run to the Polish border, and arms convoys full of ATGMs and MANPADS are rolling down it right now.",a0432b030c279fafae6efea6a94da8cde47420ed,True,False,,,,,0,1645995361,,0,{},hyowl3q,False,t3_t2odoq,False,True,t1_hyond35,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2odoq/ukraine_megathread_february_27/hyowl3q/,1645995379,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645966561.0,

The US and Russia are on opposite sides of the planet.  There are no 'cheap missiles' which cover that distance.  ICBMs though, can cover that distance VERY quickly... which is important when you want to destroy the enemy's nuclear weapons before they're launched/airborne.  But then, how do you ensure that the enemy's nuclear weapons are destroyed?  Will one missile penetrate the missile silo?  Are they being stored in this building, or that other building?  What if they're already loaded onto aircraft, spread out all across an airfield and preparing to take off for a retaliatory strike after detecting your launch?  What if nuclear missiles are loaded onto some ships in a port, but not others?  The answer to all of these questions is: use nukes and it doesn't matter.

And no, killing civilians is the least important thing in a nuclear war.  If the enemy has no military equipment, no government, and no facilities to produce more military equipment, you win.  And best of all, doing it in that order reduces the chances of the enemy destroying half of your country before they lose.",6f34b0cc1b8a9c9ee9643057baa26f0e0897c748,True,False,,,,,0,1645989824,,0,{},hyoikyj,False,t3_t2meoj,False,True,t1_hyoh1c8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2meoj/how_would_a_nuclear_war_actually_go_down/hyoikyj/,1645989839,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645961024.0,

For months Putin's two primary threats were a) to invade Ukraine and b) cut Europe off from Russian gas. Earlier this year it became more and more likely that the west wasn't willing to fold just based on that, and in response Putin decided he had to go through with the invasion to not appear weak. However, that's a threat you can only go through with once. Putin can't invade the Ukraine twice and you can't cut off European gas if Europe is already in the process of doing just that with sanctions, so in terms of diplomatic levers Russia doesn't have anything left.

You could see that quite clearly earlier this week when Putin threatened Nato with ""horrible consequences"" if Finland and Sweden were to join. Everyone's reaction was essentially ""What, you're gonna invade them too?

I think the main reason he took the gentle approach was because he needed to be able to justify it to the Russians at home. At the start of the war, they talked about ""surgical strikes"" and ""no civilians deaths"". Russians at home are being told this is all about the Donbas and helping the people of DPR/LPR. There is almost no talk that Russia has bombed every major city including Kyiv. If people in Russia knew about that widely, there would be more disdain for the war then there is. After all, this is a war of conquest that is being portrayed as a war of defense of the people of DPR/LPR.",34a95155310d4357e97240755a6fe9c5f08432c8,True,False,,,,,0,1645988147,,0,{},hyoec20,False,t3_t2odoq,False,True,t1_hyo6z9h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2odoq/ukraine_megathread_february_27/hyoec20/,1645988159,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645959347.0,

3) This is the most surprising to me. I’m shocked they haven’t blocked/cut internet access.

[],False,,Bokunomimi,,,[],,,,text,t2_chthq8x8,False,False,"I'm probably going to slow down my consumption of every bit of news regarding the situation but here are my thoughts now we're about 4 days in. All of my comment here is based on presently available information.

1) If US intelligence's assessment that the Russian intentions in the opening of the campaign was to quickly decapitate the Ukrainian Government, it appears it has failed at the 'quick' part of it. It is now the fourth day of the invasion and they still have failed to take any major city or key locations. Whether this is the result of underestimating Ukrainian forces, overestimating their own forces is hard to say at this point. It is to me, with present information, appears that this part of the plan is not working. 

Furthermore, the fact they reached out to Kazakhstan to join the war tells me they are looking to get additional manpower that isn't Russian into the fight, probably to lessen the impact of Russian casualties on Russian citizens.

2) Ukrainian army/resistance appears to be fairly effective thus far on the majority of fronts given the lack of territorial depth they have against Russian aligned forces. The only significant front that they appear to have failed to hold effectively is the Crimean/southern front which threatens to surround/capture Mariupol and Kherson in the coming days. 

3) Diplomatically, Russia is losing horrifically. It appears there are bank runs ongoing across Russia. The sanctions are placing the Russian economy in complete chaos making this invasion even more costly for Russia. The EU is seemingly united, Finland and Sweden are reconsidering joining NATO. It doesn't appear at this moment that China is openly supporting Russia. 

4) With all that being said- Ukraine is still unlikely to win the conventional phase of the war. Irregardless of the long term-economic and diplomatic damages that Pro-Ukraine nations have done; it can hardly change the disparity in air forces, numbers of forces, and generally more advanced military of Russia. Regardless of damage done- they are still considered to be the second most powerful military on the planet, even ignoring the nuclear arsenal they possess. I have a difficult time seeing the Ukrainian Armed Forces being able to reclaim major cities if/when they fall against an entrenched Russian positions. We are still only four days into this conflict- Russia has likely failed in its most optimal plans but still hold enough advantages to win the conventional phase of this.

So long as Putin is willing and able to continue the war, conventionally speaking I still think Russia has the resources to do it. However, the bigger question are they willing to hold Ukraine to support an annexation/puppet government? While I don't think an insurgency will have the same level of effectiveness as say- Afghanistan, it will still potentially bleed Russian soldiers for however long they are there. Combined with the economic sanctions- it will almost certainly make an occupation too costly to persist. 

5) To summarize my thoughts; I think there was a general underestimating Ukrainian Forces given the factors they are dealing with, and overestimating Russian Forces. Even with that; it is still a grim picture for Ukrainian Armed Forces. They are still being pushed back, they are still taking losses- but they are inflicting losses on Russian Forces that appear to be above expectations that Russian forces have. They have prevented the 'quick' part of the decapitation. The exact goals of the Russians can only be presumed from Western Intelligence sources- and that is the takeover of Ukraine in one form or another. In that regard, so far the Ukrainian Forces have prevented that. At the end of this, I don't know how we can quantify victory- whether territorial integrity maintained or the mere survival of an independent Ukrainian nation-state is enough for 'victory'. 

6) This may be more of a diplomacy question- but If the complete or near complete takeover of Ukraine is not achieved by Russian forces- how does Putin off-ramp this? How can he de-escalate this without looking weak? I have severe doubts given the amount of burnt bridges and Russian death that he'll just give up without taking away some kind of a win. Otherwise he'll look weak to the Russian People who are likely to be suffering from the sanctions/other actions by Western Powers.

Thoughts?

1. **ARTILLERY.** prewar, Russia's army was said to be centered around massed long range fires.  A mass bombardment of Kjiv is something that couldn't be covered up (nor would UKR want to). It hasn't happened. Artillery has instead seemed to be sporadic and has not achieved strategic goals like knocking out the UAF. Is Putin holding back, or is there reason to believe their munitions are severely limited or they have other issues?

2. **AIR SUPREMACY.** At least for the first few days Russia has not achieved it, the opposing AF has partially survived and SEAD is not complete. These seem like miraculous successes for Ukraine given prewar predictions here? The actual losses UAF may be inflicting may be small (or not?) but they force Russia to adapt its operations to denial of complete air supremacy.

3. **CYBER.** Again said to be a strength of Russia, and something we probably can't see into with detail, but it seems like opposing C&amp;C is intact on the regional if not the national level. If cyber is supposed to facilitate a blitzkrieg, it hasn't succeeded. It's Russians who are feeling the hurt on the home front (from financial cutoff) at the moment.

4. **ABANDONED VEHICLES - LITERALLY WHAT THE HECK.** This is a doozy. I know we are only seeing a slice of what's going on but there have been so many videos from different locations of lightly damaged or UNDAMAGED vehicles just sitting abandoned where Ukraine can loot or commandeer them, and where NATO can recover valuable intel.

Specifically, [Page 6](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/documents/section1.pdf#page=6):

**Mission and Tasks:** In the event of general war, the mission of the Strategic Air Command is to conduct global strategic air warfare in support of US national and military objectives using atomic and nuclear weapons.  In view of the growing Soviet threat to the US and its Allies, as well as the growing Soviet capability to launch an atomic offensive against them, the accomplishment of the SAC mission must be realized through the execution of the following tasks, in the order indicated:

1.  Win the Air Power battle by destroying SovBloc air power.

2.  Destroy systematically SovBloc war-supporting resources.

---

The plan goes on to discuss how this is directed explicitly at destroying Soviet air/nuclear capability, followed by command and control, and war industry, in that order.

Similarly, the US released a FEMA document outlining expected Soviet nuclear strikes on US targets... which of course focused on the same objectives (declassified FEMA NAPLAN-80 and NAPLAN-90).  The vast majority of nuclear targets were, of course, US nuclear capabilities, seats of US government, and industrial centers.

A large thermonuclear weapon (in the megaton range, so 100+ times Hiroshima) would kill most people in about a 5-10 mile radius, and do significant damage to infrastructure for maybe 20-30 miles. People up to 50 miles away may be temporarily blinded if they happen to be looking directly at the explosion.

Radiation is actually not a significant factor in such an explosion, because the kill radius from heat is much bigger than that of radiation exposure. It would increase cancer rates of the survivors that moved back into the destroyed area, but that's something long term. And considering Hiroshima and Nagasaki are still inhabited, you shouldn't overestimate that effect.

That's a lot of damage. But not compared to the size of the entire earth. Taking the high end of a 30 mile radius that is roughly 3000 sq miles. The US alone is 3.7 million sq miles.

So could a thousand nukes destroy the entire United States? Theoretically, yes. But we've been using numbers for large, megaton range, nuclear weapons. Many are much smaller. And the US will certainly be able to intercept at least some of them. Plus any attacker will want redundancy. You're not going to throw just a single ICBM at the White House.

No one knows how many Nuclear Weapons Russia has, and no one knows how many of those are actually operational. But it's probably a few thousand.

Enough to destroy a lot of major cities. But not enough to entirely destroy the United States, and certainly not enough to destroy the world.

As for Nuclear Winter. That's mostly been debunked. There have been 2476 nuclear weapons used in the history of mankind, most of them in the 60s, 70s and 80s. There's some speculation that this may have had a small effect on world climate, but certainly nothing huge. Of course detonating so many nuclear weapons all at once is different, then doing it over 3 decades, but still, most experts agree that the effect on climate would be small.

The 'prosperity' of post-WWII was due to many things --the US financing the rebuilding of Western Europe and the growth of the welfare state that served as a barrier against outright state communism. The US also had a welfare state that they gradually substituted for the military industrial complex which goes hand in hand with the poverty to this very day.

This basically amounts to a full surrender by Ukraine. Of course Russia would want that, but why would Ukraine? Maybe Russia can force Ukraine to accept such terms, if they are successful enough in their military campaign. But this thread was asking the question ""What if Ukraine wins"" and this is not a win for Ukraine by any stretch of the imagination.

If Russia is unable to fully conquer Ukraine, with their military running out of ammo and fuel and spare parts and will to fight, while increasingly harsh sanctions cripple their economy, then Putin's regime will probably collapse. In the aftermath of that I'm sure Ukraine will demand both Donbass and Crimea back as peace terms. Russia might even be forced to give up Transnistria.

That would be an incredible humiliation for Russia, and for Putin personally. Which is why Putin would never accept it. I'm sure they will keep escalating. As you say, turn Kiev into Grozny.

Russian national reports are that no Russia has died, this is a special operation over invasion, Ukrainians are surrendering en masse and civilians support troops. More local Russian gov / news seems to admit 1 or 2 deaths.

No, it's really not. Because in that 800 miles, how much is of any kind of strategic value?

&gt;The military budget of Russia is 48 billion. The military budget of Ukraine is 2.3 billion.

Again with the numbers, and no context. The Battle of Long Tan was between 108 Australians and over 2000 Viet Cong. The Aussies won, with 18 killed on their side, and more than 200 dead VC, probably more than 300. Asymmetric warfare is never as cut and dry as you're trying to make it out to be. 

&gt;Ukraine operates mostly former Russian hardware and whatever they managed to get from the west which is usually poorly integrated.

I'm a pilot. Not military, but my father was. I'm very familiar with the capabilities of Russian and Ukrainian hardware. Elbit avionics in Ukrainian Sukhois are not even remotely 'poorly integrated'. It is custom designed equipment.

&gt;Talking about ""morale"" in era of blowing people up from miles away is a bad joke.

Why? 

That was rhetorical. You would have explained why if you weren't just trying to dismiss the point out of hand. Morale is never a 'bad joke'. The Russians are literally abandoning armour on the side of the road. They have lost at least two An-26s full of paratroopers. And one Ukrainian fighter pilot became an ace in a single afternoon.

[],False,,Sattorin,,,[],,,,text,t2_covvb,False,False,"&gt; Historically, it has been difficult to estimate the total number of deaths resulting from a global nuclear exchange because scientists are continually discovering new effects of nuclear weapons, and also revising existing models.

&gt; Early reports considered direct effects from nuclear blast and radiation and indirect effects from economic, social, and political disruption. In a 1979 report for the U.S. Senate, the Office of Technology Assessment estimated casualties under different scenarios. For a full-scale countervalue/counterforce nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, they predicted U.S. deaths from 35 to 77 percent (70 million to 160 million dead at the time), and Soviet deaths from 20 to 40 percent of the population.[30]

&gt; Although this report was made when nuclear stockpiles were at much higher levels than they are today, it also was made before the risk of nuclear winter was first theorized in the early 1980s. Additionally, it did not consider other secondary effects, such as electromagnetic pulses (EMP), and the ramifications they would have on modern technology and industry.

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust)

---

Important to note that, when that report was made in 1979, the world's total stockpile of nuclear weapons numbered ~53,000... whereas today, the total stockpile is around 9,500. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons)

And further, it's very unlikely that all of those would be fired during a single conflict as it's very technology-intensive to produce more and countries would want to have a continued nuclear deterrent during the post-nuke rebuilding period, before new nuclear weapons could be produced.

As I understand it, nuclear targets generally prioritize military and industrial targets first, then population centers.  So with a vastly reduced number of available nuclear weapons, I would suspect that casualty rates would drop even lower than the simple 9,500/53,000 ratio would indicate, as significantly fewer would target population centers.  In a conflict between Russia and NATO, Russia's main priority would be eliminating the ability of NATO to roll into Russia and eliminate their existence as a country after the nuclear exchange... which means prioritizing the destruction of NATO military assets over simply killing as many civilians as possible.  However, with the obvious decline of Russia's conventional military capabilities since the USSR days, it couldn't hope to take control of Europe after a nuclear exchange... meaning the post-exchange war would leave most Europeans and Americans alive, and Russia as a crippled nation waiting to be put down by conventional forces.  Nuclear war is a lose-lose proposition of course, but while the West would eventually recover, it would be the end of Russia.",892193e19e90b4dae5d4dd9f361ce8efaa538d32,True,False,,,,,0,1645978540,,0,{},hynpimf,False,t3_t2meoj,False,True,t3_t2meoj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2meoj/how_would_a_nuclear_war_actually_go_down/hynpimf/,1645978557,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645949740.0,

On point one, more people, doesn't matter. There are only so many you can deploy before you start overcrowding the place and creating a target rich environment. Numbers are a factor, but there is such a thing as too many. for example, Australian defence strategy involves 'bottlenecking' the enemy. By focusing strategic assets in only a few locations, there are only a few locations that demand defending in order to stave off invasion completely. It's like setting up a machine gun at the end of a corridor that only two people can traverse at a time. Doesn't matter how many you have, no one is getting down that corridor while that MG has ammo.

On your second point, no. That's false. They don't have 'a lot more' money at all. Russia's economy is not that great, and with the economic sanctions, and the financial support being given to the Ukraine, even if that were true, it has quickly become not true. 

Point three: better tech? Nope. Pretty much the same, actually. And Ukraine has looked after their military much better than Russia, not to mention benefiting from a number of Western-backed upgrades, such as the Elbit avionics in their Sukhois. Russia doesn't have that. 

Better trained/more experienced forces? Debatable, but that doesn't matter when you bring morale into the equation. Ukrainian forces have the home-team morale advantage. Many Russian military personnel won't want to be there. 

None of that matters, however, when you consider logistics. Putin underestimated Ukrainian capabilities even worse than you have, and opted for a ground blitz without first establishing air superiority. This would have worked if they'd taken Kiev within 24 hours, but now we're seeing the results of that being halted by Ukrainian defenders. Without air superiority, without establishing some territory along the way, they've basically cut themselves off from their own logistics, and wars are won and lost on the back of logistics. You can have a million men. Without logistics, it only takes one enemy to beat you. This has been the case for wars since wars have been a thing. No war has been won without excellent logistic support, and no war has been lost with it. 

Make no mistake. The Ukraine can, in fact, win this. But not just because of a strategic flop of an opening round by Russia, but because they are in fact a very capable military that too many people are underestimating.",04e13ca8d103cef804ecedc295adcdbf956dc8e9,True,False,,,,,0,1645976910,,0,{},hynliif,False,t3_t2nbtx,False,True,t1_hyn9cb0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nbtx/lets_say_ukraine_wins_a_decisive_victory_whats/hynliif/,1645976924,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645948110.0,

There’s just too many targets and not enough munitions, let alone the difficulties of getting these to the front lines.

Where I think these weapons will have the most effect is on the global geopolitical stage: through the delivery of these weapon systems we are seeing a sea change in the relationship between Germany, NATO and wider European geopolitical threats. Germany has been historically reluctant to the point of stubbornness to either help in international conflicts or to even to contribute to European defence in any way, such is the legacy of their role in the World Wars. However, now that a fellow democratic nation is under assault by an aggressive autocracy, Germany has realised that remaining on the sidelines of world conflicts is no longer an option in the new return to great power conflicts. Now that Germany has both general politics support and the confidence to supply lethal aid, they will be much more confident in later endeavours to strengthen European defence against future threats.

We can already see this in action with their utterly surprising pledge to drastically increase their defend spending, a massive about face from their policy of essentially pacifism a few days prior. This is a historical change in German foreign policy and these weapons are a symbol of that change.

[],False,,Dire88,,,[],,,,text,t2_eqd2w,False,False,"I would argue yes, because Ukraine is almost as large as Texas, but that's only part of the problem.  
  
From what is currently on the table, Russia's intent appears to have been to rapidly capture Kiev, force a capitulation, and install a puppet government - all before the international community could rally against them. In order to do so they stepped off with airborne assaults and armor/mech spearheads that dove deep...way too deep.  
  
Airborne units are great for rapid offenses, but the moment initiative is lost they're done for - unless they can be resupplied and reinforced. That can't be done unless ground forces link up, or you have air supremacy and can fly in support (as an aside, this is one of the reasons the U.S. is looking to bring back light tanks for airborne units).  
  
Armor advances suffer the same fate. Ideal conditions, an armor advance can make about 300 miles before refueling is needed. In combat, facing armored resistance, you can easily half that. While armor can advance rapidly, you need mech and infantry to secure the rear and allow logistics packages to move up. LOGPACs are large, especially when supporting these large columns. So you have large convoys in open terrain, and refueling/rearming/repairs makes you tanks and support elements sitting ducks for extended periods - easy targets for artillery and air. (Literally an A-10/AH-64 pilot's wet dream).
  
So Russian failures here are the product of three major failures:  
  
1) Russia did not establish air supremacy early. Without air supremacy, airborne units have been cut off and the initiative lost. And without air supremacy, picking off armor columns and LOGPACs are like shooting fish in a barrel.  
  
2) Russian equipment is aged, which increases the logistical burden. Russian naval power has long been seen as a rust fleet too expensive to properly maintain. Russian ground forces don't appear to be in a much better state given the footage we're seeing in Ukraine. In addition, Russian doctrine really appears to have not kept pace with the the West - who has been rapidly helping Ukraine update their defensive plans and equipment for months.  
  
3) Russia appears to have been way too optimistic in their initial expectations. As advances stall, already poor morale becomes worse. Casualties are climbing, video footage  is feeding back through forces and the civilian population, and support for the invasion is abysmally low. Add in that they did not meet the initial goals of the invasion or the initial timetable, that the Ukrainian people have rallied around the flag and an effective President, and the international community has, almost entirely cut Russia's already contracting economy off at the knees...things will just get worse starting Monday morning when the markets open.  
  
In short, Russia fumbled - hard. And even if they succeeded in capturing Kiev now, it is too late to realize their goals. They don't have a strong position at the table, and have only succeeded in showing the world that Putin and Russia are no longer the feared Russian bear, but little more than a paper tiger - with the exception of a nuclear arsenal that is likely just as logistically neglected.",384d1c970007ba3aefd62cd02c4d8e0e3cc85060,True,False,,,,,0,1645975798,,0,{},hyniu7b,False,t3_t2odoq,False,True,t1_hyn5uci,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2odoq/ukraine_megathread_february_27/hyniu7b/,1645975813,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645946998.0,

I don't think of this as an easy, instant, or full solution. It's more like using a bike lock. I always lock my bike using a heavy-duty U-lock. Yet I've still had two bikes stolen. But I'd probably have had a hell of a lot more stolen, had I not locked it, or used a crappier lock. An effective lock slows down the thiefs and makes it so there are a broad range of circumstances in which it's simply not possible, or not worth the risk, to try to steal a bike.

&gt; I'm not a global finance expert, so maybe I have this all wrong but its not hard to see Western financial institutions up to their ears in credit risk tied to oligarch assets, not to mention other complex financial structures that would spiral if asset seizures and/or freezes happen. And I'd wager this whole semi-shady wealth stashing business is intermingled with Western ""oligarchs"" also engaged in these kinds of wealth hiding exercises, putting their wealth at risk, too.

I totally agree with this. It's an issue, and I think this intertwining is exactly why we haven't done anything. Prior to a couple days ago, there was no political will to do anything because the status quo was too comfortable.

But now people are being forced to confront the consequences of the inaction. And it's not just the stuff in Russia, it's money laundering all over the world, both organized crime and all sorts of low-grade isolated corruption.

I personally would have prefer we do something about these problems decades ago. It might have put a damper on other problems, like the drug cartels in Mexico, or the widespread scammers that spam everyone's texts and calls day in and day out.

[],False,,TwarVG,,,[],,,,text,t2_g9cce,False,False,"Comparisons between NLAW and Javelin are kinda pointless. Javelin is a heavy AT system, and NLAW a light system, meaning they perform different roles and often compliment each other. 

Heavy AT weapons, in this case Javelin, will belong to specialist ATGM teams held at the platoon or company level. These systems are usually quite big, bulky, expensive, complex, but incredibly powerful with long range and are typically guided for maximum effectiveness. They're very well suited to long range engagements against any armoured target by an entrenched foe.

Light AT systems are usually held at the section/squad level to be operated by a basic rifleman for dealing with threats below a tank at close ranges such as APC/IFVs and soft targets. Typically these are unguided, short ranged, not particularly powerful, cheap and often disposable. 

With that being said, NLAW is a bit unique in the light AT world in that it's significantly more capable than its contemporaries such as the Carl Gustav or AT4 and sits between typical light AT and heavy AT like a Javelin. 

* NLAW uses a missile rather than a recoilless or rocket boosted projectile meaning gravity doesn't need to be accounted for, it's point-and-shoot for a direct attack against soft targets.
* It uses predictive-line-of-sight (PLOS) guidance for moving targets, meaning the gunner has to track a moving target in his crosshairs for 3 seconds, after which the missile will calculate the necessary lead and correct itself on launch. This gives it an effective range against both moving and static targets far in excess of typical unguided AT weapons and removes much of the skill/luck element needed to make a successful shot.
* Its main firing mode is overfly top attack (OTA) whereby the missile will automatically fly 1 meter over the aimpoint, a dual mode magnetic/optical sensor will detect when it's over the target, and then fire an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) directly through the thin roof armour of the tank.

These features make the NLAW the reigning king of light AT by making it easier to use, more accurate, longer ranged, and by giving the infantry section the means to reliably destroy heavy armour at short-medium range without relying on specialist teams being around who typically don't fare well at close range anyway.",01dc87901c359102531be0977d8ddd57441ea669,True,False,,,,,0,1645973922,,0,{},hyneirj,False,t3_t2nqt7,False,True,t1_hyn8s9l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nqt7/germanys_1000_antitank_weapons_and_500_stinger/hyneirj/,1645973937,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645945122.0,

[],False,,giritrobbins,,,[],,,,text,t2_3msd2,False,False,"Drones are robotics are the future of battle, and it's going to be terrifying to be lagging in this area. 

Drones covers a huge number of platforms from something like a Predator down to something like the Flir Black Hornet. That's five orders of magnitude difference in size there. 

The large systems, say broadly larger 50-100 lbs are just too at risk from enemy air defenses, especially when you don't have absolute dominance. They're generally pretty rare and exquisite aircraft and losing one is bad. Operationally you wouldn't want to risk something unless you absolutely needed to. When coupled with the fact there aren't many of them in play does limit how effective they can be over a pretty big operational area. In the US Army if you aren't the main effort you were unlikely to get support from this class of drone in places like Afghanistan and that likely is the case in Russia. Last, the technology markets well but likely has severe operational limitations. While Russia claims all these advanced capabilities sanctions seem to have limited the ability of Russia to develop truly advanced systems. These are fully fledged aeronautical systems that need FAA or ICAO certification because they need to fly through National and International airspace which is a challenging engineering problem. 

Yes these large systems are cheap to operate, compared to a traditional manned fighter but that doesn't make them cheap. 

On the small side, this is the wicked problem and probably will redefine the future of warfare like communications did. Payloads are increasingly small so you can outfit a fleet with LWIR, SWIR, MWIR, SAR, hyperspectral or EW payloads and because they can fly closer, the quality of systems doesn't need to be as high, reducing cost. Hiding in a future battlefield is going to be increasingly challenging and when coupled with Arming and Aided Target Recognition systems means if you move your tank or APC it's likely going to be targeted and destroyed. No country in the world is there yet but with a deliberate investment many could be. And even without AI capabilities, keeping a few dozen loitering munitions, and being able to call in an artillery strike that's a minute or two away, without having to worry about counter battery or anything else is a game changer. It democratizes fires and means a small unit, like a dismounted Squad couple potentially take on an Armor formation (not that they should ever attempt that, but they could hypothetically). 

I'm unsure what capabilities Russia has at the lower tactical echelons but training and integration with your forces tactics is challenging because drones in many situations are very different to how Soldiers traditionally approach tasks.",44700f0b8a7397ba9203f921f996ed9d801ecaca,True,False,,,,,0,1645971067,,0,{},hyn8jkg,False,t3_t1ru12,False,True,t3_t1ru12,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1ru12/for_years_i_heard_about_drones_dominating_the/hyn8jkg/,1645971083,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645942267.0,

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"I think squeezing the oligarchs fortunes in some way is a compelling argument for weakening Putin's control and putting pressure on his leadership of Russia.  But my question is how easy can it be done and to what extent does it get pushback from the Western financial interests who are partners in this?

The simple (and perhaps oversimple) idea is that oligarchs exfiltrate their wealth to the west, buying expensive real estate and other more traditional securities investments.  You just freeze or seize these assets, bam, you've locked up their wealth.

I can't help but wonder, though, whether the oligarch thought about the political risk exposure of these assets.  What happens if your government does some dumb-ass muscle flexing and suddenly you're on the shit list of the state where you've squirrelled away your capital?  One way to deal with this might be to not spend your hard-earned cash on that $30 million condo/mansion, but instead put some of it in an American financial institution who's also willing to let you borrow against it?   So you put $10 million on deposit and they're happy to let you borrow $25 million to buy the condo, and maybe even more (since the condo is collateral itself) for other purposes.

Now if asset seizure/freezing comes up, this American financial institution is on the hook for all the leverage they financed against your $10 million deposit.   $25 million for the condo, maybe $5 million in more liquid lending.  Not to mention other possible financial fees and services.  The oligarch is out the $10 million deposit and the $5 million they put  into the condo, but maybe they've managed side leverage which reduces their exposure to the condo and used more liquid lending for other leverage elsewhere.

I'm not a global finance expert, so maybe I have this all wrong but its not hard to see Western financial institutions up to their ears in credit risk tied to oligarch assets, not to mention other complex financial structures that would spiral if asset seizures and/or freezes happen.  And I'd wager this whole semi-shady wealth stashing business is intermingled with Western ""oligarchs"" also engaged in these kinds of wealth hiding exercises, putting their wealth at risk, too.",24c2b22d8bd61783f7d576b2861c77db65b50db7,True,False,,,,,0,1645965958,,0,{},hymzkot,False,t3_t23vui,False,True,t3_t23vui,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t23vui/seize_the_oligarchs_wealth_a_crackdown_on_the/hymzkot/,1645965976,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645937158.0,

Neither side has any interest in disseminating accurate information and you should be skeptical of anything you hear from someone who isn’t a US official (and even then you should pay careful attention to their exact wording) or a trusted international news outlet like Reuters, BBC, or CNN.

How many S-300s, Buk M-1s, etc. does Ukraine have left? How many pelicans and phoenixes has Russia killed with anti radiation missiles? Ukraine doesn’t have AWACS planes (afaik) and relies on ground based radars and SAM systems for its air defenses. We already know that a successful SEAD precedes inserting airborne formations into the enemy’s rear. The fact that Russia is able to do that at all, let alone in the Ukrainian capital is extremely alarming. We can guess that Russia feels it has successfully degraded most of Ukraine’s fixed radar installations and that it has killed most of its mobile radar systems. You have to disregard the little PR stories of valor and shooting down Russian fighter jets with manpads and ask yourself about the big picture factors that made you skeptical of Ukrainian resistance before the war started. How badly have Ukraine’s air defenses been degraded (so far we have anonymous US defense officials saying essentially that they still exist and going no further)? How many casualties have been inflicted on the Russian Air Force thus far (enough to disrupt their mission tempo at least?)? How successful has Ukraine been in repelling Russian mechanized forces? If their air defenses are no longer viable, will they be able to keep their forward deployed troops supplied through Russian air interdiction? None of these questions will be answered any time soon (i.e. this is something that gets settled well after the conclusion of the war). All we have are little nuggets of vague information that can be interpreted in whatever way your biases want. The west targeting Russia’s forex reserves, for instance, is an extremely drastic move. Something you use as a last resort. That’s troubling as it indicates a dire situation for Ukraine. Also, the fact that Russia feels safe to simply insert airborne troops into the Ukrainian rear is a red flag WRT the state of Ukrainian air defenses. Then there are things you can take positively. Russia doesn’t seem to have captured many of its primary objectives yet. There are some reports of substantial casualties.

Remember that shock and awe is something you do to Iraq, not North Korea. It’s certainly not something you do to a democratic country who’s troops are fighting for their country in principle. The entirety of Ukraine’s armed forces have to be dealt with, systemically. They’re not going to collapse in place if you kill Zelenskyy and capture Kyiv. They could very well hold out in pockets with no logistical support for weeks or months. I wouldn’t conclude that Russia is on the back foot just because the war isn’t over yet.",392ed33a869b7bf5a85944442b231407e3b7d9ba,True,False,,,,,0,1645954633,,0,{},hymksau,False,t3_t1w6lp,False,True,t1_hymacv7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1w6lp/ukraine_megathread_february_26/hymksau/,1645954646,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645925833.0,

1) Was it actually unprepared?  What do we actually know?

2) Nobody wants to believe a terrible thing is about to happen.

3) Mass mobilisation and preparations ruins the economy and people's lives -- if you're wrong about an invasion and you do all that stuff it's politically costly and potentially provokes the (much stronger) enemy.

4) In 2014 Ukraine lost 3 parts. They've been in a a form of conflict ever since. They get used to it, no invasion came in those 8 years but there is a war. The background threat was always there, people got used to it, ignored it.

5) US and UK intelligence, or the politicians that deliver it, had a poor reputation until last week.  

6) A lot of the Russian mobilisation could be explained by excercises which happened fairly regularly (which is half their point of course, to cover invasions).

7) Nobody believed in real wars, especially in Europe, until it happened. Sure the US and UK might beat up some weak country in the desert somewhere occasionally.  But a proper invasion in Europe? No, that's from the past. It's all cyber war and social media manipulation now from Russia, not actual boots on the ground invasion.

8) Ukraine isn't a competent country. It's very poor and a lot of that will be because it's badly run.  Ukrainians voted for an actor / comedian in Zelensky because their actual political class was so worthless.


What indicated to me that the Ukrainians weren't prepared was the Russian airborne assault on Antonov Airport outside Kyev on Day 1. That would likely have been followed by air transports landing more troops and equipment and an attempt made to decapitate the state and government before Kyev could really prepare defences.  

That's an incredibly bold move on Day 1 of an invasion when air superiority had yet to be established. It failed obviously but that the Russians even thought it might succeed indicates either how bad their intelligence was or how poor the Ukrainians had prepared.",a5efb10d8a5649f718f869a812c0b1f71220a802,True,False,,,,,0,1645953561,,0,{},hymje47,False,t3_t2cupt,False,True,t3_t2cupt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2cupt/why_was_ukraine_so_unprepared/hymje47/,1645953573,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645924761.0,

A combatant force is required to pacify and instill law and order for it's right of occupation to be recognized and the 'war' phase declared over.    
Which makes any subsequent attacks those of an illegal combatant.   
What you are seeing here is a combination of hysterical glee (Zelensky, riding the same high that Winston Churchill once did, in 1940, while England burned and he fled to the countryside, during every raid on London...).  And brave-face depression, as carefully auditioned actors talk about what they are in fact very uncertain about, as though they were not trapped animals in a sinking ship of state.  
When the Russians are in the city, enmasse, there will be a tipping point as intensity and rate of combat pulses increases to a breaking point and then things will change, rapidly.  As/after Zelensky has his martyrdom moment or runs like a weasel and morale collapses.  
This is not to say that military plans will ever survive first contact with the enemy but the Mainstream Media etc. are spinning things like a gnat in a blender, looking to make 450 men dead in an effort to conquer a country look like the Ukrainians are winning.  
They are not.  Most likely because, except for forward and flanking security elements the Russians are refusing engagement.  
Were it otherwise, the news agencies would not be shy about publishing lists of dead Ukrainians and numbers of fallen cities.  Nor in showing columns of dead Russian tanks and particularly CS/CSS trucks, struck by NLAW and FGM-148.  
They aren't showing them because they don't exist.  No Mortain, no Falaise because you can bet your mortgage that CNN would be publicity whoring it all over the news, if they could.  
The Russians are kid gloving this but at the same time, being careful means using tanks to escort heavy SPH and letting the artillery sterilize targets nominated by UAV/CCA/CAS and Spetz in SR mode.  Bypassing what they can, obliterating on approach what they must and maintaining their drive on Kiev as the center ring COG kill.  
And the sad part is, other than the cost to both countries, is that this is part of 'The Great Reset' by which the Cold War begins with a Sitzkrieg.  If we wanted to, we could stop this in 3-4 days of concerted ops with strategic bombers and AGM-158s against those self-same logistics targets, dropping bridges, chopping up rail lines, hitting depots and forward airbases.  Even moving truck convoys.  
Inside Russia.  
No gas, no bullets, no MREs or medical evac and the Russians will stop in their tracks, saving us the trouble of copperhead and kingsnake sorting them from the Ukrainians.  However far they have advanced, their maneuver elements would halt within hours.  
The Ukrainians cannot win this as some kind of VC fight.  Indeed, they should remember what the PAVN did to the Vietcong, at Tet, as an indication of what is likely really happening here.  'After we belatedly roll in, to cavalry the settlers.'  
At the same time, if we are truly interested in halting the suffering rather than simply gifting the Russians a bunch of Javelins and Stingers, Americans need to Article IV put an end to the Biden/Harris/Pelosi farce, as fast as we can.

Why should they?

Telecomms go first.  Then gas, electricity, water, emergency services, police, food distribution, transportation nodes (to include trains), armories, concentrations of Ukrainian forces, check points, Ukrainian TACSAM units.  Counterbattery if any is required.

Some of this will require active targeting by UAVs.  Some will require careful timing.  Hit a train as it approaches, empty, rather than as it leaves, full.  Rototill an intersection late at night rather than mid day.

Induce the trapped-rat conditional mindset.

What you are looking for is isolation of the population from itself and from it's leadership.  Not the 40,000 hardkill of 1939 Warsaw.  By the careful application of fires which divides the city into sectors and channelizes any defense into kill lanes, when the Russians make their move.

In particular, all communications which are not satcomms (military based, probably supplied by U.S. SOF) need to end so that continued rah-rah pump up of the population as contact with the outside world can end and the full sense of beleaguerment set in.

Leaving Ukrainians can be alone with their worst nightmares.  Which are far worse than what the Russians will actually deliver but which will paralyze them with fear that there is no more centralized control.

Getting units in which can take up positions at various high points to snipe Zelensky's next attempt to prove he is still fighting would be a particularly notable objective.  Helicopters can do this, provided you understand that you have to hostage everyone above floor X in a given highrise. 

Modern Artillery has accuracy rivaling that of a smart bomb (\~10m CEP) when delivered inside the mid range.  And that's without guidance on-shell.

The thing you have to understand is that the military has an ability to supply a lot of electricity in a very short time, if they need to.  And you don't have to hit a generator hall to disable it.  A few hits on the primary trunk lines will do the trick.

So the nature of a 'humanitarian crisis' is inherent to how long the Ukrainians choose to deny the truth of tanks controlling all the lines of sight along major traffic arteries, making it harder and harder to move defenses around.",5b73094df18e6fe3e72b72d38951743b3e402779,True,False,,,,,0,1645948169,,0,{},hymc8ry,False,t3_t1w6lp,False,True,t1_hyltp8v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1w6lp/ukraine_megathread_february_26/hymc8ry/,1645948180,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645919369.0,

I think that was much more a case of 'tail wagging the dog' in that the neocons and also specifically the Bush family had vendetta against Saddam.  When HW Bush went in 91, the coalition of nations contributing was absolutely extraordinary.  I am not sure there was ever a similar conflict with so many nations allied on one side.  But in 91 Saddam had made a critical miscalculation, which might actually be illustrative here.

Saddam was mad about the Kuwaits slant-drilling into the Iraqi oil fields. (Which probably wasn't really that big of a factor as the oil can naturally move across the field and directional drilling technology at that time was much more limited than today.)  Historically Iraq was upset about the UK-drawn 1922 border with Kuwait.  Financially, the majority of debt that paid for Iraq's war with Iran was owned by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  OPEC members were overproducing and crude was $10 a barrel, which for a country  that depends on oil exports, is a financial death-blow.  It had only been a few years earlier in 1984 when one Donald Rumsfeld was sent to meet with Saddam to enhance relations/sell arms.

In the run-up to the invasion, the US envoy and Saddam met; what was said was disputed, but somehow Saddam took it that the West would not do anything economically, and that was somehow a 'green light' for an invasion.  When asked why the US hadn't been more clear or forceful, her response was ""we didn't think he would go that far"" 

Then subsequent result was that Saudi Arabia's oil fields were directly threatened by Iraqi forces.  It actually took both a few days and Thatcher telling H.W. Bush to ""not to go wobbly"" before the Carter doctrine was invoked and what followed was the most one-sided mass conventional conflict in modern history.

At the time, Saddam thought the other Sunni nations should have 'had his back' and forgiven the Iraqi debt in service for defense from Iran.  He believed that having had US backing just 6 years ago and an unclear statement from the US, there would not be a response.

In the Clinton years, Saddam sort of fucked around but wasn't able to really do anything.  When W came in 2001, it must be remembered that the Republican Party platform called for ""full implementation"" of the Iraqi Liberalization Act, which explicitly called for the removal of Saddam.  Enter Cheney and Rumsfeld, who are both in favor of military action, it only takes 9/11 to have a massive cover to prosecute the fake case for a 'pre-emptive' war.  

W. made the mistake his father was unwilling to make, which is trying to occupy.  After 91, it could be said that the nature off all conflict changed as conventional v. conventional forces were shown to be quickly one-sided given certain advantages (e.g. thermal sights).  In 2003, the Iraqi army just vanished.  Oh they took plenty of shit with them, to be used later of the next 10+ years as IEDs, but they realized fighting a conventional invading force made no sense.  So the 2003 invasion of Iraq was basically planned before W. even got to the White House, they were just waiting for a reason.  The events of 9/11 created great nationalism in the country which was manipulated to justify the war.  

Occupying is hard, it's always hard, it just depends on what degree you and the populace get along. The Danish were submissive to the Nazi's but in general the Nazi's took a hands-off attitude and Danish resistance/insurgency was minimal.  In Iraq, a relation of mine driving a Abrahams watched his best friend die in front of him via IED.  Not only was the only thing senseless, it speaks to the inability for one vastly different culture to occupy another.

Ukraine is sort of in-between.  Culturally Russia and Ukraine *historically* as inseparable.  Its argued Kyiv is more important for Russian culture than Moscow or St. Petersburg.  But in terms of contemporary sentiment, Ukrainians very much want to turn west, aside from the few in the east Donbas.  And with a territorial incursion, nationalist sentiment appears to be very high.  

Moves were made to SWIFT today which is a big step.  It's not enough, but these are still early days.  That said, speed is still important.  Putin has not committed more than 50% of his forces, possibly less than that.  This would suggest he has a more ""rational"" plan in mind, perhaps trying to do a 'limited damage' campaign to ease the ability to occupy.  

Rational actors can make bad decisions because of perceptions or giving one piece of the political puzzle too much weight, or making unfounded assumptions.  Irrationals actors are more people like Kim Jong Il who's actions seem meaningless long-term.  A united Korea, aside from him personally, is in the best interest of most of the populace.  Put him in exile on a nice beach somewhere and let the people of the North actually get enough food.  If Il's end-game is to make like 10 ICBM's and then bully, I think it's a terrible tactic, but he's also irrational so he might actually shoot one or more off.",5710641c0b17f48bd82e4d4b6ef0570acef5878e,True,False,,,,,0,1645947691,,0,{},hymbl0r,False,t3_t0rmlg,False,True,t1_hyljgw0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t0rmlg/are_sanctions_against_russia_completely_toothless/hymbl0r/,1645947707,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645918891.0,

The Ukrainian military would largely disband and/or surrender due to an overwhelmingly coordinated Russian military with air superiority and mechanized ground forces. And the Russians would be able to notch kill ratios of something like 20 Ukrainian fighters to 1 dead Russian. 

Well that assumptions was wrong. Deadly wrong. 

It seems like the kill ratio is in the neighborhood of 1-1.  

This source seems to say that Russia has suffered 3500 casualties along with a couple hundred POWs. These numbers seem to be supported by the videos posted along with evidence of destroyed planes, helicopters, and tanks.
https://twitter.com/myroslavapetsa/status/1497443132010606592

When it comes to Ukraine's military, it's hard to find solid numbers. It seems to be in the 1,000-10,000 range. If anybody has some solid numbers, that would be good to know.

So that means they're basically in a war of attrition. And Russia cannot afford a war of attrition with Ukraine, because they won't have enough soldiers to occupy Ukraine after the war. Coalition forces had ~300k soldiers in Iraq to control a country of 20 million. Russia is looking at ~150k to control a country of 40 million. And they've already lost about 2% of their fighting force. Additionally, the coalition soldiers were better trained and better equipped. The one difference is the Russian soldiers can rule by fear, but the fear based ruling will result in a stronger resistance. 

Okay, that's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is it doesn't sound like Russia planned out logistical support for their military to perform a long term engagement. This thread covers that.  

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1497498201527521281.html

Along with the videos we're seeing of abandoned equipment in Russia along with the tank that ran out of fuel. One tank that ran out of fuel could be an anecdote. That said, the abandoned columns seem to indicate fuel is a problem. 

Add to the problem of maintaining supply lines in Ukraine. The Ukraine military can easily employ hit and run tactics. Russian forces could subsist off the land, so to speak, for a small amount of time. That said, they will have a hard time getting enough fuel for their tanks and mechanized equipment. A tank burns about a gallon of diesel per mile. A column of 5 tanks will burn 500 gallons to go 100 miles. And per hour, they probably burn a minimum of about 5 gallons per hour just idling. It'll be very very difficult to find that much fuel in a war torn region. Especially with an enemy looking to sabotage you, so they need their own supply. 

Without their mechanized equipment, the only thing the Russians have going for them is their air power. And it seems like their close air support isn't well coordinated with the ground forces. 

What that means is that their blitzkrieg has failed. They are now going to be doing urban fighting. Which will be a war of attrition. Again, a war of attrition will favor Ukraine as they are defenders and can sustain more losses than the Russians can. 

So what are Russia's options? It seems like they are betting everything on getting Kiev and decapitating the government. If the resolve of the Ukrainian military and people (making molotovs in the streets) is any indication of the situation on the ground, I don't think killing Zelenskyy will deter Ukrainians from fighting. So even if the Russian attack on Kiev is successful, which early indications are it is not going well, it does not seem like that will deter Ukrainians from continuing the fight. 

There is the possibility that Russia can use thermobaric weapons. I'm not sure about how that will go. Especially if Russia decides to stay outside of the main urban areas. That's a possibility as well. 

Ukraine's situation is much much different. They are depending largely on foot soldiers with anti-tank and anti-air weapons with small arms. This gives them an enormous amount of flexibility in how they attack. Also, because they are defenders, they can blend in with the urban landscape. And the only way to take out fighters like that is to locate them using ground forces and use air power to give yourself an unfair advantage. It's what the US did in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. To enormous success. 

The difference between the Ukraine and the US enemies, Ukraine has better weapons and is better trained. The anti-tank and manpads will make a huge dent in the air power and mechanized advantage Russia has. Additionally, it does not seem like the coordination between Russian ground forces and air forces is as effective as it is in the US military. 

The way I see this happening is the Russians continue to gain territory while paying a high price in terms of casualties and equipment. The Ukrainian military (and civilians) will continue to harass the Russian occupiers. This will go on for a while (a couple weeks) until the Russian occupiers are no longer able to hold onto territory due to lack of supply and support. They are either going to surrender or be pushed back to the borders.

The above ignores the political situation, which is a developing story that can change in an instant. Especially if the Russian military refuses to fight or if large protests break out in Russia. 

The bottom line is this. I don't see a world where Russia wins this fight militarily using conventional forces. I think they've lost and it's a matter of time before their forces are stopped and will eventually start to be pushed back to the Russian border. It might take 2 weeks, it might take a month.",3d0d48be835ed7469a0b908d34f83a83c3c4383f,True,False,,,,,0,1645946829,,0,{},hymacv7,False,t3_t1w6lp,False,True,t3_t1w6lp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1w6lp/ukraine_megathread_february_26/hymacv7/,1645946839,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645918029.0,

1. The 176 ICBMs and 588 ALCMs (air launched cruise missiles) were entirely under the control of Moscow the whole time they were in Ukraine.  The Ukrainians never had the codes for the warheads, and the ALCMs were disabled by the Russians when they left.
2. The ICBMs had a minimum range of 5000km, which means they couldn't hit anything but the very eastern-most parts of Russia and maybe the UK, even if the Ukrainians could have somehow cracked the Russian control of the warheads. 
3. The 2600 tactical nuclear weapons were artillery shells, mines, and gravity bombs.  The Russians had been pulling these out of non Russian countries even before the Soviet Union collapsed.  Ukraine formally became an independent nation in December of 1991, by May of 1992 the Russians had taken all of the tactical nuclear ordinance out of the country and back to Russia, well before the nascent Ukrainian ministry of defense could get control of the arsenal.
4. Ukraine may have physically had the missiles and warheads in their country, but in addition to lacking the codes to arm the warheads they didn't have any of the other things you actually need for strategic nuclear capability: no early warning systems, no targeting satellites, no uranium enrichment or plutonium processing for when the service lives expired, no research or manufacturing capacity for maintenance and modernization.  By the time Ukraine became independent the ICBMs had less than eight or nine years left on their service lives.
5. Finally, the Chinese government fucking cheered when they denuclearized:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Chinese Government welcomes the decision of Ukraine to destroy all nuclear weapons on its territory, and commends the approval by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on November 16 of Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon State. China fully understands the desire of Ukraine for security assurance. The Chinese Government has always maintained that under no circumstances will China use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-weapon-free zones. This principled position also applies to Ukraine. The Chinese Government urges all other nuclear-weapon States to undertake the same commitment, so as to enhance the security of all non-nuclear-weapon States, including Ukraine.

The brand of western, third-way, neoliberal capitalism installed in Ukraine will ultimately lead to outcomes similar to that seen in the US: roughly 75 percent of the population with less than a grand in their bank accounts, rising wealth inequality, a permanent underclass and so forth. That's what capitalism does. It leads to monopoly, most growth/wealth pooling towards those with a monopoly on land and credit, and so blocs of power which undermine democracy. Many economists and academics have pointed this out, and indeed we have studies showing that ""liberal democracies"" are functionally anti-democratic, in the sense that the legislation they pass is overwhelmingly at odds with the wishes of the majority (and aligned primarily with the wishes of the ruling class).

Again, that's what capitalism does.

But of course Putin's brand of highly authoritarian capitalism - a mix of kleptocracy, neoliberalism and state capitalism - is worse.

There are already concerns, as reported by vice news, that the militia may not be listening to the government. Now you are just handing out guns, which in itself isn't a problem, but to whom are you handing these guns to? 

Do these people have any organization? Are they within the national structure? Or will they be loyal to their groups more than their country after this war.

1) Consider that Ukraine has been deliberately encouraging a lack of information to be published regarding just about everything related to its military. While I do agree there seems (to say; lack of evidence) to be a clack of preparation, this could equally just be apart of keeping intelligence on Ukraine's military out of Russian hands on the more smaller level.

2) Doing such actions would give justification to Russia to start a war. They could say ""Look they're getting ready to attack Donbas, we must help them"" and have some (not complete, far far from it) legitimacy to their attack. We of course know for certain they were going to attack anyway, but when there was the window for peace- it seems wise not to escalate the situation. This is not the first time there has been increased tensions or a troop build up on the border. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

3) Panic. If they started to declare ""Russia is going to invade!"" Ukrainians might've panicked, military included. Panic like that is likely not helpful when you're dealing with the defense of your country.

4) What if the US intelligence was false or incorrect? We of course with the benefit of hindsight see it was almost exactly correct. Intelligence can be wrong- and going back to point 2- you may not want to escalate the situation in order to give them justification.

Deterrence of NATO will not be what it was despite some would like to think ""if it happened to a proper member it will be different"". How the trade should be made is not as clear cut to me.

Then there's question why several thousand casualties and a strategic defeat in Grozny didn't invited nuking, but a presumed a few hundred from narrowly focused air to air and SEAD campaign in western Ukraine is widely perceived as potentially radioactive? Because Putin claim it's really important to him and he's playing crazy? I think through 2020 Iranian missile attack US has shown to have the nerve to take a punch and stay unmoved instead of frantically climb the escalation ladder. A red line was drawn in Korea that US want at least half a Korea, I don't see a commitment on outcome in Ukraine, seem to be ""give Ukraine what we said we're gonna give as long they don't drop dead, and let the battle play out, whatever it may be"".
