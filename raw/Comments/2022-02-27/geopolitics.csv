Putin has mainly handled dissent by avoiding major crises. The biggest crisis he has had to deal with was the 2011-2013 protests. And those were really nothing compared to what he’s going to face. Back then, he only had to deal with pro-democratic protesters. This time it will also have to deal with a financial crisis, the oligarchs, the economically discontent and anti-war protesters, all while his security forces are occupied with fighting a war.

Article key take-aways ——————————

- In a surprising turn of event, German chancellor announced to rearm German military by committing $100B immediately and raising military expenditure to &gt;2%.  

- According to Olaf Scholz, this is direct response to the current situation in Ukraine, and he also emphasized that the German military might will be used only for preserving peace in Europe.  

- The announcement was made along with other measures to aid Ukraine, such as sending missiles and permitting transfer of German manufactured arms to Ukraine.

Discussion ————————————————-

This structural change in military spending is a big departure from Germany’s past peaceful posture, and is sure to have an impact in geopolitics of Europe, if not the world. 

Along with with last year’s announcement of Poland’s plan to modernize and double its military size, and now Germany rearming, EU may be headed to becoming a military heavyweight in Europe.  

Obviously, this would make Russia’s further ambitions more risky.  

Furthermore, with strong European situation, US/UK will be able to concentrate their forces in Asia, and even European countries could project there more than token frigates.  This would make any of China’s plans at a higher risk.

IMO, a pretty significant development today.",3bca8bca2e88c4aec5a19c23c09f22b53a19ed60,True,False,,,,,0,1645990075,,0,{},hyoj8jq,True,t3_t2v8xj,False,True,t3_t2v8xj,/r/geopolitics/comments/t2v8xj/germanys_reversal_on_ukraine_weapons_policy/hyoj8jq/,1645990092,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645961275.0

The first 48 hours from when the ""peacekeeping"" troops entered Eastern Ukraine were executed brilliantly. The 2 republics became independent without firing a shot, and the Russian air forces neutralized most of Ukraine's air force and anti-aircraft assets.

During this lighting strike, Putin probably should have kept pushing into Kyiv and installed a new government during the chaos. He's now waited too long, and it's hard to see what Russia can do to improve their position.

If Russia only entered the 2 republics, the sanctions wouldn't have been that severe, and most of the world probably would have respected their claims. Now, they've set a new military precedent by striking deep into Ukraine, they've unified NATO, they've unified the Ukrainian people and its military, and they've received devastating sanctions.

Worst of all, they've given the Ukrainian government time to build an escape plan. At this point, even if Kyiv falls, the legitimate government can be moved to a new location and become more decentralized. Russia's chances of being able to install a new government loyal to Moscow is becoming increasingly lower. The more aggressive they become and the more civilians they kill, the less support they receive.

Putin asking his nuclear teams to prepare captures perfectly the conflicted Russian psyche and expresses their self-conscious anxieties. Putin believes that threatening nuclear weapons makes him look like a strong man. He's thinking, ""they don't respect me? I'll show them.""

I have tried to take into account the concerns of both nations, so it may sound a lot more compromising than it should be. The hypothetical peace deal would consist of the following points:

* Russia would immediately withdraw its forces to positions before the 24th of February.
* The breakaway portions of Donetsk and Luhansk would be immediately returned to Ukraine, with the Oblasts themselves becoming autonomous regions of Ukraine for a period of 10-20 years. After this period, a referendum would take place to determine the status of these regions.
* Crimea would be subject to a referendum (continued Russian annexation/return to Ukraine) in the presence of UN officials only. No Russian, Ukrainian or NATO politicians would be allowed to campaign during this period. The referendum results will be binding for both Ukraine and Russia.
* Regardless of the referendum, Sevastopol would still remain under lease to the Russian Navy.
* Lastly, regarding the eventual status of NATO-Ukraine relations, there could be two options:
   * Ukraine can freely join NATO, with a moratorium on placing nuclear/long-range weapons of any nation (I confess I don't know much about offensive weapon categories, sorry) on its soil and that of the Baltics forever. This moratorium would immediately expire in the event of war between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian army would also be under this moratorium for a distance of 50/100 km from the Russo-Ukrainian and the Russo-Baltic border.
   * Or, Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO but it can freely join the EU with no restrictions on such weapons and their use.

I hope that I can learn more from informed responses to this line of thought, and I'm open to any suggestions/criticisms.

[],False,,shotwn,,,[],,,,text,t2_k8f9q,False,False,"Turkey had a state policy about Ukraine that pretty much stayed the same since start of Russian - Ukrainian conflict. Even before risk of being isolated diplomatically they were in full support of Ukraine.

I describe it as a state policy, rather than Erdogan's because Turkey had increasingly cooperative relations with Ukraine since 92. This was partly due Tatar population of Ukraine. Turkey had an experience of Soviet pressure over Turkish speaking people at that point (ex. Communist Bulgaria). But also because it **made perfect geopolitical sense**.

I want to quote Duygu Bazoglu Sezer from her [1996 article](http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11693/48357/Ukraine_Turkey_and_the_Black_Sea_Region.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y).

&gt;In other words, friendship and cooperation with Turkey, one of the three most powerful neighbors in the Black Sea region, emerged as a convenient geopolitical alternative to Ukraine's almost total isolation in the early years of independence. From the Turkish perspective, relations with Ukraine also seemed to address an important geopolitical concern: the desire for the preservation of the post-Soviet status quo in the Black Sea region. The independence of Ukraine was essential to the fulfillment of this goal. Hence the decision of Turkey to extend unequivocal support to Kyiv in its post-1991 struggle with Moscow for full sovereignty and independence. (p.88)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;President Kravchuk's visit to Ankara on 3-4 May 1992, became the first official visit to Turkey by a Ukrainian head of state. The treaty of friendship and cooperation signed during this visit constitutes the fundamental political and legal instrument in which the parties affirm their mutual respect for each other's independence and territorial integrity. Politically, this pledge translates into Turkish support for Ukraine in its quest for full independence from Russia and sovereignty over Crimea. President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey paid an official visit to Ukraine on 30 May-1 June 1994. The highlights of the visit were the exchange of the instruments of ratification of the treaty of friendship signed in 1992, and President Demirel's promise of Turkish assistance in the repatriation of Crimean Tatars to their homeland by constructing 1,000 homes. Numerous projects for economic, commercial and defense cooperation were taken up in this period, some of which found their way into agreements. In January 1994, an oil pipeline agreement was signed, envisaging the transport of Middle Eastern oil through Turkey to Odesa. The project has been resisted by the authorities in Odesa, on environmental grounds. Meanwhile, the so-called ""luggage trade"" flourished, as returning Ukrainian visitors to Istanbul flooded the Ukrainian markets with inexpensive Turkish consumer goods, which incidentally, became a convenient form of trade between Turkey, a haven for such goods, and the neighboring CIS states. (p.89)

So it is safe to say Turkey had always sided with Ukraine against Russia. They are natural friends due multitude of reasons.

Just to tie up past to today, policies we had seen in last years are in line with this. Since 2014 Ukraine and Turkey had multiple important agreements and military trade deals. Some examples related to the conflict would be:

* Building Turkish Ada-Class Corvettes in Ukrainian ports for Ukrainian Navy.
* Movement between countries without passport only with ID cards.
* Turkish technology transfer for Ukraine to switch to biometric ID cards.
* Increased tax-free cash transfer limit in flights from Odessa to Turkey.
* Bayraktar drones, Ukrainian engines for new Akıncı drone. Baykar to open a joint venture factory in Ukraine. TB2 orders and Akıncı pre-order from Ukraine.
* Ukraine to transfer aerospace technology to Roketsan.
* Aselsan to create Aselsan Ukraine, export radios, joint RCWS project and more.
* Zalson to license tank self protection systems to Aselsan.",a8899df8ac42c327bf03b2b9a1c4a76214a477bf,True,False,,,,,0,1645984051,,0,{},hyo3n0z,False,t3_t2o337,False,True,t1_hynbiq1,/r/geopolitics/comments/t2o337/turkeys_rapprochement_with_russia_may_not_survive/hyo3n0z/,1645984065,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645955251.0

1) Even if they won't attack, there will likely still be 'enemy weapons' stationed there. You wouldn't want non-friendly missiles pointed at you.

For example, the US and China both don't want to freely allow the other from controlling ocean waters in the pacific.

Buffer states/zones exist between major powers, the middle asian countries are much less important for example because there is no easy avenue for conflict there.

2) There is the soft-power/culture war conflict side of things too. If NK was united with SK, the result would likely be democratic. Through the shared borders, there'd be direct and easy cultural cross pollination (and infiltration by entities that want to stoke internal ideological conflict - something that does happen).

Something that might matter less to the China of today which is much more powerful, but too the China of a decade or two before which was much weaker, would have been considered a major threat to it's autocratic leaders. Having the NK there, directly contains that threat.

It's not just about ideology as well. It's more about control, and having decisions go the way you want in that region. For example, the Chinese are investing a lot in Africa, and the African countries are 'voting' in China's favor in global institutions like the UN.

One possibility the book talks about is that he may continued to exercise power through controlling the president in other ways similar to how he did with Dmitri Medvedev, but that will come with its own tradeoffs too, e.g. the new leader will try to expand his power and Putin may have difficulty controlling him.

After Russia annexed Crimea and invaded the Donbas in 2014, the U.S. did sanction some Russian energy activities. Financial activities in the U.S. were blocked for Gazprombank, Rosneft, and Novatek. Additional sanctions followed for certain oil production activities of Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rosneft, Lukoil, and Surgutneftegas. These restrictions made doing business harder for these companies, but they did not make it hard enough. A full energy blockade on Russia would hurt the most.

&gt; What the White House should—and can—do now, is institute a full-spectrum energy export embargo on Russia. This is already authorized under Executive Order 14024. 

&gt; Europe will balk, but Europe will survive. It still has 32% of its natural gas supplies. Each E.U. member country maintains an emergency 90-day supply of oil in stock, too. Weather is currently above average temperatures in much of Europe. Spring is nigh. Two months’ reserve supply is enough for Europe to stay warm until the seasons change. Meanwhile, the world energy markets will adjust before the next winter.

&gt; Two months is not enough time to build new LNG terminals or full length pipelines, but it is enough for the U.S., Canada, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and others to ramp up production. 

&gt; The U.S. is a net importer of oil, but experts expect it could increase production by over a million bpd in 2022. Biden has already asked Saudi Arabia to increase production, and there are others the U.S. can ask. Some are likely to agree given the astronomical price of oil, elevated by the Russian invasion itself. 

&gt; The U.S. can reinstate its support the EastMed pipeline project, for example, to improve medium-term energy security for Europe. 

&gt; Terminals can follow, along with more renewables and nuclear. Biofuel infrastructure can be completed in well under a year. And if the U.S can coax Iran back into a nuclear agreement, it can lift sanctions on Iranian oil that could then be used to offset Russian supply.

&gt; The White House should work with the European Union to seize or freeze any Russian energy assets held outside Russia. Gazprom in particular has numerous holdings around the world that could be seized, with the proceeds used to offset Russian oil and gas in Europe. Coupled with a European levy on Russian petroleum imports, this would leave Russia paying for its own loss of energy dominance.

&gt; These measures are going to hurt every country as energy prices rise. Europe is particularly vulnerable. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already thrown energy markets and prices into turmoil. If the U.S. and its western allies are serious about punishing Russia for its assault on Ukraine, and doing so in a way that has a chance of forcing Putin to compromise, a full-spectrum energy export embargo must be the keystone sanction. The U.S. sanctions package simply is not weaponized without it. It is currently porous and toothless when a full 36% of Russia’s budget in 2021 was from oil and gas.

&gt; Other sanctions aim at Russia’s veins; oil and gas blockades cut it off at the artery.

[],False,,Accomplished-Will-23,,,[],,,,text,t2_43tc2e59,False,False,"&gt; The sanctions package the White House has implemented against Russia in the last 48 hours is remarkable. It is broad, deep, and targeted all at once. *It is also almost certainly going to be more hype than impact*. 

&gt; Russia is already subject to numerous sanctions since its 2014 support of separatists in Donbas. It has neither given Crimea back to Ukraine nor left the Donbas in peace, and clearly the threats of more sanctions had none of the hoped for deterrent effect.

&gt; Putting aside that sanctions do not generally work, and certainly not on a timeframe of relevance to an invaded country, the Biden Administration and the rest of the free world have reiterated that their support for Ukraine will not much exceed sanctions.

&gt; If this is what we have to work with, let us at least make it truly hurt by including embargoes of [Russian energy](https://time.com/6151493/russia-oil-gas-embargo-sanctions-ukraine/), too

&gt; At present, the energy sanctions instituted against Russia are limited to the trickle down effect of banking sector and other restrictions, and to a block on several Russian state-owned energy companies accessing new debt and equity on U.S. markets. These companies are Gazprombank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Transneft, and RusHydro. This will make doing business harder for these companies. 

&gt; But for Gazprom, for example, the record setting (up to €186 per megawatt hour) natural gas prices of 2021 have given Russia plenty of blubber to live off during a sanctions-imposed hibernation. Oil prices have insulated Russia from sanctions hits, at least in the short to medium term.

&gt; Nor will sanctioning Nord Stream 2 or Germany’s refusal to continue with its certification have any effect on Putin’s inclinations. 

&gt; **This is because Nord Stream 2 was never necessary either for gas transit or for Russian economics**. 

&gt; Over 100 bcm capacity of the 225 bcm total between Russia and Europe is already sitting unused in existing pipelines running principally through Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic Sea. 

&gt; The 55 billion cubic meter (bcm) capacity Nord Stream 2 pipeline was only ever an effort to bypass and damage Ukraine. 

&gt; Thus, once Russia holds Kyiv, Nord Stream 2 instantly becomes redundant as a tool of aggression against Ukraine. Just as instantly, the sanctions against it become meaningless beyond symbolism, and even then only as a symbol to the West.

&gt; Other parts of the White House’s sanctions package are also unlikely to hit hard. The ban on sensitive technologies reaching Russia will definitely set the country back a bit, especially with several Asian countries having agreed to join the tech blockade. Importantly, these include South Korea and Japan. 

&gt; But as [Ambrose Evans-Pritchard](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/02/24/greater-russia-now-full-spectrum-commodity-superpower-less-vulnerable/) detailed in the Telegraph, Russia dominates the global supply chains for titanium, palladium, neon, and other critical strategic minerals; it is a “full-spectrum commodity superpower.” 

&gt; Russia can retaliate effectively, if only by trading these minerals to China in exchange for U.S. sanctioned technologies.

&gt; Russia also has its own, albeit relatively unsophisticated, semiconductor chip manufacturers. 

&gt; Additionally, once it controls Ukraine, Russia will gain the smaller country’s wealth of uranium, its military and nuclear manufacturing prowess, including Motor Sich, and multiple other tech and military powerhouses. The technology angle is blunted as a U.S. pressure point, but certainty its inclusion is an important piece in a comprehensive sanctions package.

&gt; **Yet so far energy sanctions are mostly missing. This is despite the fact that Russia is literally dependent on energy exports.** 

&gt; Oil and gas together constituted over 30% of Russian gross domestic product before the 2021 (mostly Russian engineered) energy crisis sent prices soaring. In 2019 oil and gas were together over 60% of Russian exports. 

&gt; It is a gaping hole in the U.S. sanctions package that Russian hydrocarbon exports have not been embargoed. If, as [Jason Furman](https://www.businessinsider.in/international/news/harvard-economist-and-former-obama-adviser-says-russia-is-basically-a-big-gas-station-and-is-otherwise-incredibly-unimportant-in-the-global-economy/articleshow/89739904.cms?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Click_through_social_share) now famously said Russia is little more than a “a big gas station,” then how can the White House not sanction its pump?

&gt; This glaring omission in Biden’s sanctions package could be the consequence of a promise to the countries of Europe, cowering in fear as their dependency on Russian gas renders them impotent to fight back against Russia’s invasion. 

&gt; This is not unreasonable. Germany especially will suffer if Russian gas imports are blocked; Europe imports [40% of its natural gas from Russia](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_imports_of_energy_products_-_recent_developments#Main_suppliers_of_natural_gas_and_petroleum_oils_to_the_EU), but for [Germany it is up to 50%](https://www.statista.com/chart/26768/dependence-on-russian-gas-by-european-country/), [on top of 45% dependency on Russian coal and 34% on Russian oil](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-dependence-imported-fossil-fuels). 

&gt; **Meanwhile, Germany is continuing to phase out nuclear, making it more reliant on Russian energy imports**.

&gt; Russia is reciprocally dependent on energy exports, however, giving Europe leverage with which it could partially join a U.S. petroleum embargo. 

&gt; European governments are worried about keeping their countries warm and lit. This is partially a supply issue, but also a question of timing. 

&gt; Europe is moving toward climate friendly fuel sources anyway, but it cannot do so overnight because of restrictions in capital and construction timeframes. 

&gt; [Alan Riley](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/alan-riley/) argues that at least the capital restriction could be mitigated by a levy on Russian oil imports. 

&gt; Because the European Union imports approximately 600 million barrels of oil per day, an E.U. levy of just €10 per barrel of oil imported from Russia would provide collateral on which to issue a 20-year €400 billion Eurobond. 

&gt; Rather than waiting for the tariffs to accumulate to finance the energy transition, a eurobond could be accomplished very quickly, and the money could be used to secure alternative fuel supplies, build energy transition infrastructure, and build energy resilience. The European Union could wean itself off Russian petroleum imports with money raised off of Russia.

&gt; Or, perhaps, the White House is more concerned with rising gas and utility prices for American consumers already facing the highest prices since 2014. 

&gt; Midterm elections are coming, and Biden’s approval rates are underwater. 

&gt; If the U.S. sanctions Russian oil and gas, or Russian energy more broadly, this will absolutely increase energy prices around the world. 

&gt; Americans will pay more for electricity and gas, and probably for everything else, too. There will be political fallout for an Administration already blamed for [record 7% inflation](https://time.com/6146918/us-inflation-surge/).

&gt; The fallout from Russia’s invasion is already roiling markets and supply chains, however. American consumers will already be affected. Instead of the futility of trying to insulate American voters, the White House should eke out a win by hurting Russia in the process.

&gt; Moreover, high oil and gas prices could also easily be a boon for U.S. companies. There is already a bidding war for tankers of U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG). Europe and Asia are fighting to outbid each other. Instead of dipping again into the strategic petroleum reserve in a desperate attempt to appease U.S. voters, the Administration could work to liberalize U.S. petroleum export regulations. 

&gt; As Andrew Fink argues, this could include repealing or revising the Jones Act (Merchant Marine Act of 1920) requirement that U.S. petroleum movements at sea be on U.S. ships with U.S. crews. In practice, this law prevents foreign governments and energy companies from actively participating in U.S. domestic petroleum trade. If this were relaxed, Europe could then buy its fuel more easily from the U.S. and far more easily transport it home to replace Russian oil and gas.

&gt; The U.S. could also revoke the exemptions that allow Russian petroleum product transactions to continue despite sanctions advertised as designed to stop exactly that. 

&gt; Not only does the current sanctions package not target energy, but it in fact includes carve outs that allow for work arounds of the energy inclusions. 

&gt; [Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-86-about-those-sanctions?utm_source=url) highlighted that the Administration, in Biden’s own words, “*specifically designed [the sanctions package] to allow energy payments to continue.*” 

&gt; The Treasury Department included exemptions—called General Licenses—from the financial sanctions for energy transactions. **As long as the payments are processed by non-U.S. banks, it is still completely acceptable for western countries and their companies to do business with, for example, Gazprom and Rosneft**. 

&gt; #In fact, Javier Blas reported that in just the 24 hours immediately following Putin’s recognition of the so-called People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk the European Union, U.S., and United Kingdom “bought a combined 3.5 million barrels of Russian oil and refined products, worth more than $350 million at current prices,” and “another $250 million worth of Russian natural gas.” 

&gt; Plugging our own sanctions holes is a good place to start making the sanctions package effective.",a925242d12879a04abe1462bf2678f737ac51ba2,True,False,,,,,0,1645974885,,0,{},hyngpmp,True,t3_t2pja5,False,True,t3_t2pja5,/r/geopolitics/comments/t2pja5/the_vital_missing_link_in_the_us_sanctions/hyngpmp/,1645974899,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645946085.0

Basically, a whole  lot of political changes and even homophobe policies: here's the excerpt:   


**The Purpose of Constitutional Reform and Key Amendments**  
Analysts say that the purpose of the constitutional reform is to formalize the procedure for the possible transit of power in the country (which has obviously been postponed until a later date) and to create a legal framework for it. And they consider the most important of the amendments to be strengthening the status of the All-Belarusian People's Assembly (APA) in the draft Constitution, which has existed since 1996, but all this time has had no legal basis for its activities.  
According to the draft, the APP becomes the highest representative body of the country, competent to cancel the decisions of other government bodies, to impeach the president, to appoint members of the Central Electoral Commission and judges of the Supreme and Constitutional courts, to submit laws to parliament, to appoint referenda, to propose amendments to the constitution, to introduce state of emergency and martial law, and to consider the issue of the legitimacy of elections.  
In addition, the proposed amendments prohibit the president from issuing decrees with the force of law, increase the term of parliament from four to five years, slightly expand the competence of the prime minister, provide for the creation of the institution of the Commissioner for Human Rights, and enshrine in the constitution the norm that ""marriage is the union of a woman and a man.""  
**Two more terms for Lukashenko?**  
As follows from the draft, one and the same person may occupy the presidential office in Belarus for no more than two terms, but this rule will take effect after the newly elected head of state takes office. In other words, Alexander Lukashenko will be able to rule for another 10 years after his current cadence (expires in 2025). For the ex-presidents of Belarus, the draft constitution provides special security guarantees - they cannot be prosecuted for actions committed while in office, they are guaranteed a seat as a delegate of the National Assembly and a lifetime membership in the Council of the Republic.  
Among the books on the shelf are pamphlets ""The Constitution of the Republic of Belarus.  
Special security guarantees are given to the ex-presidents of Belarus in the draft Constitution  
At the same time, no one - besides Alexander Lukashenko - may hold several offices at once. Lukashenko is entitled to remain both president and chairman of the Assembly, as proposed by the SNB. However, to be registered in this capacity, presidential candidates must have lived in Belarus for the past 20 years and not have a residence permit abroad. Such a requirement deprives many opposition candidates, who have fled the country because of the threat of repression, of a chance to run for president.  
The draft of the new constitution does not contain the indication in the current one that Belarus strives for neutrality and aims to make its territory a nuclear-free zone. Both representatives of the authorities and their opponents agree that this norm did not actually work.",e8ef463d4d714e31d0a30e8cc87a1ffc270cdd7e,True,False,,,,,0,1645949070,,0,{},hymdhen,True,t3_t2j91b,False,True,t3_t2j91b,/r/geopolitics/comments/t2j91b/right_now_belarus_is_having_a_constitutional/hymdhen/,1645949083,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645920270.0

Rather than go through the entire post, I'll restrict my critique to his passing assertion that NATO is purely defensive in nature, a claim that is demonstrably false.

Devereaux states:

&gt;Concessions from NATO – some of Putin’s western enablers (particularly on the far-right, though in some cases also on the far-left) have suggested that NATO could have avoided this by making some sort of concessions to Putin, like agreeing to never permit Ukraine to enter the alliance. Often this is couched in terms of NATO being ‘threatening’ to Russia. Now on the one hand, NATO is a purely defensive alliance, nevertheless it is not hard to imagine that Putin, a repressive dictator, felt threatened by a strong alliance of (mostly) free and democratic states to his West. But given that Putin’s goal was, as above, regime change (at least) in Ukraine, it is hard to see how permanently barring Ukraine from NATO would have prevented his actions.

Whether it be Yugoslavia, Libya or Afghanistan, (or Iraq!) since the cold war, NATO has a long history of attacking and dismembering countries that haven't themselves attacked any NATO country. 

If you want to delve into the historical context of the conflict, then I recommend watching this lecture from 2015 by Prof. Mearsheimer who's specialties (International relations theory, International Security, and Deterrence Theory) are far more germane to the topic than Devereaux's:

Will it explain Putin's current actions? In a lot of ways, yes. Some of them is what the author pointed out in the article -- his over reliance on security services and his desires for popular support.

Prior to the invasion, I had argued one of the driving forces behind Putin's actions may be a desired to recreate Crimea 2014 in order to boost sagging popular support and I had frequently checked Russian polls in order to gauge its effect.

There are going to be uprisings and resistances in Ukraine and they will likely prove to be a huge headache for Russia. It points out that insurgencies are extremely dangerous and nearly impossible to subjugate when it has three factors on its side: Reliable supply lines, ample reserves of fighters, and protection across the border.

Ukraine has all three and in an especially pronounced way. The author points out that due to what Russia did in Crimea, the west has been building a potential insurgency network in preparation for if Ukraine gets invaded. Best of all, the Russian military can't even hope to beat them because insurgents would have access to numerous countries. Poland especially as Russia would hesitate to trigger a war with NATO by chasing them into Poland.

The only advantage for Russia is that it will attempt to exterminate any potential resistance leader and that it has time as insurgencies take years to build up. However, the United States -- with its far more powerful military and better funding -- was repelled (and in an embarrassing way) under worse circumstances by Afghani insurgencies.

What I've seen speculated, is that his goal with creating the separatist regimes was for them to be reintegrated into Ukraine but with special status and the ability to veto policy decisions, giving Russia huge power to influence how Ukraine is governed and how it acts.   

  
That's what he was pushing in 2021 when there were troops massing on the border to Ukraine making threats. Ukraine didn't accept the gambit.
